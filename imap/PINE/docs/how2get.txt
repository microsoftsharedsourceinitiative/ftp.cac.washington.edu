                        How to obtain Pine software


Pine® - a Program for Internet News & Email - is a tool for reading, 
sending, and managing electronic messages. Pine was developed by Computing 
& Communications at the University of Washington. Though originally 
designed for inexperienced email users, Pine has evolved to support many 
advanced features, and an ever-growing number of configuration and 
personal-preference options. Pine is available for Unix as well as for 
personal computers running a Microsoft operating system (PC-Pine).
