                                Version 4.64
                          University of Washington
                                      
   Pine(R) is the University of Washington's "Program for Internet News
   and Email". It is intended to be an easy-to-use program for sending,
   receiving, and filing Internet electronic mail messages and bulletin
   board (Netnews) messages. There are versions that will run on many
   different flavors of the Unix(R) operating system, as well as a
   version with GUI amenities for 32-bit flavors of Microsoft Windows
   (95, 98, NT, 2000, Me, and XP).
   
New in Pine 4.64

   Version 4.64 addresses bugs found in previous releases and has a few
   additions as well.
   
   Additions include:
   
     * Even though Pine does not properly support the UTF-8 character
       set, the Allow-Version3-LDAP feature will cause Pine to go ahead
       and try to talk to an LDAP server which is a version 3 server. You
       will find this feature in the Setup/Directory screen. It is
       separately settable for each server you configure.
       
   Bugs that have been addressed in this release include:
   
     * Crash with malformed mailbox name that allows an authorized user
       to run commands from the shell
     * When a PC-Pine network read, or a non-SSL Unix Pine network read
       took longer than Tcp-Read-Warning-Timeout (default 15 seconds)
       Pine would always time out instead of allowing the user to
       continue
     * Bug when setting Reply-Indent-String to the Empty Value. Quote
       showed up as a double quote instead of as nothing.
     * Crash when Pine attempts to open a remote (IMAP, POP3, NNTP)
       mailbox specification that has an unterminated quoted string in
       the network part of the name
     * Sorting by Score would not work after changing a message's score
       by setting a keyword or changing its status
     * Crash when adding then deleting the first header color
     * Crash when Bouncing a message and then selecting the address to
       bounce the message to using ^T and the directory server screen
     * When exporting a flowed message, perform wrapping to get rid of
       long lines and space stuffing
     * Incorrect MESSAGE INDEX when message contains some high-bit
       characters (do a better job of ensuring that control characters in
       a message don't reach the screen by mistake)
     * Limit amount of delay that can be caused by the system clock
       jumping backwards
     * Bug that caused confirmation prompt to be skipped when Apply
       Saving messages with the first message in the set not having
       deleted parts
     * Allow commas in Customized-Hdrs fields and in header fields
       defined in Roles
     * When two Pines were accessing the same address book and the two
       Pines had different ideas of how it should be sorted, they could
       get into a slow loop changing the sort order back and forth
       forever. Now give up and leave the sort alone after the first time
       this happens in a session.
     * When Disable-Keymenu was set the "Other" subcommand did not work
       correctly in the Apply command
     * When an address book contained multiple entries with the same
       nickname the ^T method of selecting always selected the first
     * Crash when editing the first of two address book entries with the
       same nickname and changing the first from a single address into a
       list of addresses
       
   Version 4.63 addressed bugs found in previous releases and had a few
   additions as well.
   
   Additions included:
   
     * When cancelling a message being composed the commands are now "^C"
       followed by "_C_onfirm" instead of "^C" followed by "_Y_es". "^C"
       "Yes" was close to "^X" "Yes", the command used to send a message.
       The change is there to prevent inadvertent cancellations. The old
       behavior may be restored by setting the feature
       Compose-Cancel-Confirm-Uses-Yes.
     * Command-line option "-url" can now be used with "-attach" and
       similar options
     * Quell-User-Id-Prompt no longer falls back on prompting for user-id
       if a connection to the INBOX can't be established
     * New token _CURNEWS_ which is equal to the current newsgroup if
       there is one, mostly for use with the Reply-Leadin option
     * New token ARROW for use in the Index-Format option for the MESSAGE
       INDEX screen. This causes the current message to be indicated by
       an arrow instead of being shown in reverse video. It may also be
       colored if desired.
     * New feature Force-Arrow-Cursor turns on an "arrow" cursor in the
       MESSAGE INDEX just like you get with the Assume-Slow-Link feature
       turned on, except the coloring of the index line will still take
       place.
     * Address book entries can be exported to a file in tab-separated
       columns for more convenient import to some other clients
     * New variable Quote-Replace-String and feature
       Quote-Replace-Nonflowed allow for replacing quotes with the string
       of the user's choice when viewing a message
     * Character Set matching can now be done conveniently in Rules
     * Field for comments added to Rules. Warning: Don't use this field
       until all of the Pines that you run are version 4.63 or higher,
       since it will cause the Rule to be ignored in previous versions.
     * There is a new filterNow command located under Setup/Rules which
       causes your filters to be re-run immediately. This is _not_ useful
       for most users since filters are run immediately as new mail
       arrives, but it may be useful if you want to re-run filters after
       changing the status (New, Important, Deleted, and so on) of
       messages and you don't want to wait until exiting the folder or
       expunging.
       
   Bugs addressed in the 4.63 release included:
   
     * Crash when an IMAP server dies while browsing the server's
       collection of folders
     * Crash with message "Lock when already locked" when saving multiple
       messages where some of those messages have had attachments deleted
     * Possible crash when viewing an attachment with an encoded name
     * Crash when saving from a local folder which has been closed due to
       external modification
     * TABbing for new mail in a news maildrop with multiple newsrcs was
       broken
     * Role inheritance only worked one level deep
     * When viewing messages with the Quote-Suppression-Threshold turned
       on, non-flowed messages with long lines that wrapped caused
       confusion with the quoted line counting
     * Malformed addresses were not always handled cleanly when replying.
       Now the original address should be presented to the user who must
       sort it out.
     * In PC-Pine, Postponed tab was needlessly grayed out when editing
       headers.
     * It wasn't possible to add a collection that was a sub-collection
       of the open Inbox on a cyrus server because Pine tried to create
       the directory Inbox and that Folder/Directory already existed
     * Handles (for example, for URLs) would sometimes be selectable even
       though they had been scrolled off the screen one line, causing
       confusion
     * Failed to notice expunges in local folders which were in mbx
       format
     * In composer: ^R to reveal Attachment line, attach a file without
       leaving the line (e.g. with ^T), then ^R while still in the
       Attachment line, and the attachment was not sent
     * When viewing format=flowed messages with the DelSp=yes parameter
       urls were not recognized if they were split in the middle. It is
       recommended that messages not be sent with this format but it is
       known that some clients (Apple Mail is one) do send such mail.
     * Avoid unnecessary re-sort of the folder when re-filtering in
       preparation for an expunge
     * In PC-Pine, crash when fonts with unknown character sets are
       loaded
     * Bug in composer when cleaning up a flowed message with
       indentations inside of quotes.
     * Preserve Literal-Signature leading spaces in config file
     * Strip trailing spaces from signatures so that they won't be
       recognized as flowed text
     * Fix race condition in rpdump that could cause overwriting of
       arbitrary local files owned by the user running rpdump if a
       malicious user has write permission in the same directory as the
       local file specified on the command line.
     * When running Pine in function key mode, make it possible to
       Reverse the sort
       
   Version 4.62 addressed bugs found in previous releases and had a few
   additions as well.
   
   Additions included:
   
     * Enable-Newmail-in-Xterm-Icon now also sets the title bar text to
       indicate new mail
     * New feature Enable-Newmail-Short-Text-in-Icon
     * New UNIX Pine feature NewMail-FIFO-Path
     * New feature NewMail-Window-Width
     * Select command may use the pattern from an existing Rule (for
       example, an Indexcolor Rule) for its selection criteria
     * Beginning of Month and Beginning of Year options in Rules
     * Some additional tokens having to do with the current date may be
       used in the folder name that is used as a target in a Filter Rule.
       For example, you may filter messages to a folder named for the
       current month by using the _CURYEAR_ and _CURMONTH_ tokens in the
       folder name. The (long) list of all such tokens is here.
     * Three additional tokens for use with Keywords may be used in the
       Index-Format. They are SUBJKEYINIT, KEY, and KEYINIT (in addition
       to the old SUBJKEY).
     * Keywords may be displayed in color using Keyword Colors, available
       from the Setup/Kolor screen
     * The Keyword-Surrounding-Chars option may be used to slightly
       modify the display of SUBJKEYINIT and SUBJKEY tokens.
     * The Enable-Flag-Screen-Keyword-Shortcut option adds a shortcut
       method of setting keywords
     * When performing an aggregate reply (or forward), if the Role that
       would be selected when replying (or forwarding) to each individual
       message in the set is the same for all the messages, then that
       role is used just like it would be when replying (or forwarding)
       to any one of those messages.
     * Delete/No Delete prompt added to Save command so that the source
       message may be deleted or not on a Save-by-Save basis
     * Status-Message-Delay option now allows reducing the status message
       delays Pine sometimes adds
     * New feature Save-Partial-Msg-Without-Confirm
     * New feature Disable-Take-Fullname-in-Addresses
     * New feature Sort-Default-FCC-Alpha
     * New feature Sort-Default-Save-Alpha
     * For selecting messages by Status, add the possibility of selecting
       based on Recent or Unseen status
     * Allow Take command to take addresses from html and enriched text
       subtypes, as well as from plain text
       
   Bugs addressed in the 4.62 release included:
   
     * Crash when sending a message with a Role that sets the To header
       if the Empty-Header-Message is set to <Empty Value>
     * Pine hangs in composer after alternate editor or speller is run
       and new mail arrives that causes an External Categorizer command
       to be executed
     * Crash in MESSAGE INDEX when using a threaded sort. The crash is
       most common when the sort is Reversed.
     * Pine could crash or hang when the window was resized down to 3
       lines or fewer while in the composer
     * In the Role editor the "To Folders" command for the "Set Fcc"
       action did not work
     * After running Pine for a long time, it would slow down until
       restarted
     * Export command in FOLDER LIST did not work with dual-use folders
     * When the Send-Without-Confirm option was turned on, flowed text
       was not produced and the Fcc-Without-Attachments feature did not
       work
     * Display bug, folder was not un-highlighted
     * When viewing a message from the separate thread index, new mail
       arrival could cause Pine to leave the MESSAGE TEXT screen and drop
       back to the MESSAGE INDEX screen on its own
     * When the UnDelete command was typed in the composer with the
       cursor in the middle of a header line, the text was inserted at
       the beginning of the line instead of at the location of the cursor
     * When some messages from a thread were selected (not including the
       top of the thread), the view was Zoomed, and the feature
       Slash-Collapses-Entire-Thread was turned on; the collapse command
       caused messages to disappear from the view entirely
     * Incorrect character conversions were possible when going from
       ISO-8859-X to ISO-8859-1
     * Quell-Charset-Warning will now also quell the short comment
       included in header lines about the charset being different from
       yours in addition to quelling the editorial comment at the top of
       a message. This is the stuff that looks like "[ISO-8859-2]" in a
       header line.
     * If the Down Arrow key was held down it caused Pine to do a new
       mail check for each repeated character, which caused a delay when
       the key was held down by mistake. Changed that so that it does at
       most one check per second.
     * An unnecessary sort of the folder (causing a delay) was happening
       when closing if a filter rule depended on message state
     * Mouse in xterm failed when clicking in the folder screen
     * Enable-Dot-Folders feature did not allow adding folders with names
       beginning with dot
     * When replying to a TEXT/ENRICHED message Pine was failing to
       filter out the ENRICHED markup
     * Crash caused by malformed ISO-2022-JP in header
     * Crash when changing Inbox-Path if INBOX was not the current folder
     * Adding a collection on a Cyrus server did not work if the folder
       already existed (Pine tried to create it and failed)
     * Pine gave incorrect messages when deleting dual-use
       folders/directories
     * Saving an attached message to INBOX from another collection did
       not work correctly (it tried to create INBOX in the collection
       instead)
     * In some circumstances, Pine could announce "No messages expunged
       from folder <x>" after an expunge command that actually worked
       correctly
     * Allow alternate editor to use quoted arguments
     * News drop folders weren't using the correct newsrc with
       Enable-Multiple-Newsrcs enabled
     * Error decoding some 8-bit headers, typically showing up as a
       garbage character at the end of a name
       
   Version 4.61 addressed bugs found in previous releases and had a few
   additions as well.
   
   Additions included:
   
     * The "^T" "To Files" command from within the composer on the
       Attchmnt header line or from within the composer in the "^J"
       "Attach" command is now capable of attaching multiple files at
       once
     * When Exporting a message with attachments you now have the option
       of saving all of the attachments in a new directory (Export
       Message File Selection) by typing "^P" while exporting
     * Feature to modify behavior of TAB command,
       Tab-Uses-Unseen-For-Next-Folder
     * When sending, flowed text (RFC 3676) is sent by default. Now it is
       possible to turn off this behavior on a message by message basis
       with the ^V command at the Send prompt. You may still turn if off
       for all cases with the feature Quell-Flowed-Text.
     * Viewer-Margin-Left and Viewer-Margin-Right made a little more
       flexible
     * Suppress quoted text when viewing messages with
       Quote-Suppression-Threshold
     * The behavior of the HdrMode Command has changed slightly. It now
       reverts back to normal mode when you switch to a new message. It
       also has an additional state if Quote-Suppression-Threshold is
       turned on.
     * The old behavior of the HdrMode Command can be restored by not
       setting the Quote-Suppression-Threshold and setting the new
       feature Quell-Full-Header-Auto-Reset
     * Feature to rename sent-mail folder to sent-mail-yyyy-mm instead of
       sent-mail-mon-year (Prune-Uses-YYYY-MM)
     * With Alternate-Role-Menu option turned on you could Reply or
       Forward using a Role. Now you can also Bounce using a role.
     * Relaxed conditions which caused a filter to not be reevaluated
       before expunging if the user changed flags manually. Now only a
       manual Undelete may cause the filter to not be reevaluated before
       expunging.
       
   Bugs addressed in the 4.61 release included:
   
     * Crash when resizing screen in empty collection
     * Crash with alternate-role-menu in empty folder
     * Crash when you enter the name of a server incorrectly
     * Crash when using aggregate Save and some attachments have been
       deleted
     * Exit folder collection with "<" command was broken
     * Export command in FOLDER LIST did not always work
     * Filtering on subject with non-ascii value did not work correctly
     * Index display sometimes incorrect when threading
     * Incorrect conversion from one 8-bit character set to another
     * Saved-Msg-Name-Rule of "last-folder-used" broken in 4.60
     * The threading-indicator-character would disappear when Expunging
       in some cases
     * Stay-Open-Folders did not work with local folders
     * Strip-From-Sigdashes-On-Reply was failing when replying to a
       non-flowed message with flowed-text enabled
     * Sigdashes were incorrectly flowed for some flowed messages
     * When building pine, compiling filter.c was broken or slow on some
       systems
     * Features hide-nntp-path and disable-shared-namespaces weren't
       being correctly initialized
     * Rule Patterns could only have a single category of Extra Headers
     * The command to Replicate a rule did not copy the "not" parts of
       the rule correctly
       
   Version 4.60 was an evolutionary release which introduced some new
   functionality.
   
   Additions included:
   
     * In PC-Pine, add ability to do piping, Sending-Filters,
       Display-Filters, and other operations where external command
       execution is possible.
     * Control margins in Message Viewing screen with Viewer-Margin-Left
       and Viewer-Margin-Right
     * Display flowed text well
     * Send flowed text when possible, with the ability to turn this
       behavior off through the new feature Quell-Flowed-Text
     * Add keywords to folders using the Keywords option to set them up
       and the Flag Command to set or clear them for particular messages.
       Filters may also set or clear keywords. Keywords may be used for
       Selecting messages, for matching messages in Rule Patterns, and
       may be displayed in the index using the SUBJKEY token in the
       Index-Format option.
     * In Mac OS X, view and send attachments and URLs according to how
       the system defines handling them, without relying on the existence
       of a mailcap or mime.types file
     * For PC-Pine, add a separate window that contains new mail
       notifications for all folders currently opened (in PC-Pine Config
       menu).
     * Reply or Forward using a Role by turning on the
       Alternate-Role-Menu option
     * More IMAP connection caching: control it with options
       Stay-Open-Folders, Preopen-Stayopen-Folders,

       Mail-Check-Interval-Noncurrent
     * More control over filtering of control characters to screen with
       Pass-C1-Control-Characters-as-is option
     * New Export and Import commands in FOLDER LIST screen
     * Now possible to use message size in Rule Patterns
     * As a convenience, a shortcut for the command line argument
       "-feature-list=feature" is "-feature", for example,
       "-signature-at-bottom" or "-no-signature-at-bottom"
     * Add PC-Pine command-line argument "-registry noset"
     * Add command-line argument "-nowrite_passfile"
     * Add feature Quell-Attachment-Extension-Warn
     * Add features Quell-Filtering-Messages and
       Quell-Filtering-Done-Message
     * Add feature Quell-Charset-Warning
     * Add feature Maildrops-Preserve-State
     * Don't remove whitespace from the end of lines, a behavior which
       can be turned off through the new feature

     * Double dollar sign escapes special meaning of dollar sign in both
       Unix Pine and PC-Pine (Using Environment Variables)
     * RedHat and Debian ports more closely obey the Linux Hierarchy
       Standard
     * Improve performance of Select command when using Narrow or Broaden
       and talking to an IMAP server
     * Add feature Disable-Terminal-Reset-For-Display-Filters (you might
       want to look into this if you have noticed that the coloring of
       quoted text is broken when viewing messages)
     * When displaying a message with QP encoding errors, instead of just
       reporting "Non-hexadecimal character in QP encoding" and then
       giving up, attempt to do the best possible

     * Port named "soc" is an attempt to use native Solaris compiler
     * Add ability to justify the full message from the composer by doing
       Control-W Control-J
       
   Bugs addressed in the 4.60 release included:
   
     * Crash when forwarding an attached message as an attachment
     * Crash because of DebugJournal code on some systems, related to the
       way they handle variable length arguments in C
     * Crash when indexline colors are enabled and the last message of a
       mailbox is expunged out from under us
     * In FOLDER LIST screen using Select, Narrowing was not working
       correctly
     * When viewing a message with colored quotes, sometimes lines would
       be erased from the screen when using the Up Arrow key
     * Bug where normal text remained the same color as links after
       viewing certain types of HTML-formatted messages

       requires an LDAP lookup
     * Forwarding an address book distribution list did not work
       correctly in PC-Pine
     * GoTo a POP folder was broken in 4.58
     * Non-terminating Filter Rules that only set message state, when
       followed by a regular terminating rule that moved or deleted a
       message, would cause messages matching the non-terminating rule to
       be incorrectly deleted
