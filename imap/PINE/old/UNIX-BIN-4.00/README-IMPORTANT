> Just after Pine 4.00 was released, we were made aware of a security
> problem with the imapd server that is included in the Pine 4.00
> distribution. This will be fixed in the Pine 4.01 maintenance release,

>    ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

> We don't have new imapd binaries available yet.
> Pine itself is not affected.
