The patch file contained in the directory:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/ssl-patch/

is intended to add SSL link encryption to the standard release of the Pine
Mail System version 4.21.  This patch requires that OpenSSL be installed
prior to its being applied. 

The following steps will apply the patchkit to the Pine 4.21 distribution:

   0) Change directories to the root of the Pine 4.21 source tree.
   1) ./build clean
   2) tar -xf simap-4.7.tar
      Which will produce the "simap-4.7" directory.
      It contains a README file explaining how it works.
   3) mv imap imap-4.7/imap-4.7c
   4) ln -s simap-4.7 imap
   5) ./build my_os
      Where "my_os" is the platform OS being built

Provided OpenSSL was already installed, the resulting Pine binary will
be capable of communicating with IMAP servers waiting for connections
on the "imaps" service port (port 993).

To request secure connection with the IMAP server, append "/ssl" to
the hostname portion of the inbox-path and/or folder-collections
pinerc variable (e.g., "{imap.foo.org}inbox" would become
"{imap.foo.org/ssl}inbox").  Once a secure connection is established,
Pine will display a plus sign, '+', in the display's top right corner.

If a connection attempt results in an error message along the lines of
"Invalid remote specification" then Pine is not recognizing the "/ssl"
switch and the patch, for some reason, failed.  Most likely because
the build script and Makefiles did not find the SSL libraries where
they were expected.  If an error similar to "Problem accessing folder
..." results, then the server's not accepting ssl connections on the
imaps port.


NOTE 1:

We also recommend that the c-client distributed with Pine 4.21 be
upgraded to the more recent c-client library found in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-4.7c2.tar.Z

To replace the c-client, simply rename the "imap" directory in the
Pine 4.21 source directory to "imap.old" and unpack the latest 
c-client there.  Once this is done, simply substitute step 3 above
with the command "ln -s imap-4.7c imap".


NOTE 2:

This patch is being made available, without restriction as to
destination, due to the recent (January 14, 2000) relaxation of export
controls.
