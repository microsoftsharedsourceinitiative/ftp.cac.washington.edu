Hi All!

I've been lurking on the sidelines, waiting for a PC-Pine
announcement.  Did I miss it?  I see a lot of discussion of DOS
platforms here...

Steve,
Gosh, I wish I could say "yes, you missed it"... :)
Unfortunately, we're running late.  Here's the current status:

There exists a test version of PC-Pine that is available by request.
Nearly 100 people have requested it.  The good news is that very few bugs 
have been reported, and at least some folks are using it regularly.
The bad news is that this version lacks something that is essential at
many sites, including ours: the ability to access remote folders in
addition to the INBOX.  (This is not needed for those who wish to have 
saved-msg folders on the local disk or workgroup fileserver, e.g. Novell.)

Fortunately, the remote folder code is finally coming together, and Mike 
hopes to have a version for internal testing next week, with the goal of 
a general "gamma test" release around May 15th.

Because it is very difficult to get user interfaces "right the first time",
we anticipate that there will be additional "iterative refinement" of
the new remote folder capabilities, as we gain experience with them.
In addition, there's still a whole bunch of other stuff we're trying to
get done in the next couple of months, for both Unix Pine and PC Pine. 

I hope all or our patient supporters will find that the upcoming releases 
have been worth the wait...

-teg


p.s. To take advantage of the remote folder facility, a new version 
of IMAPd will be needed, and that will be released at the same time
as PC-Pine.

hi : i wonder if any of the pine gurus can comment on the following
problem we have with pine3.05.

many of our administrators use pine to communicate electronically with large
groups of people at our university. we have several people who have defined
groups that contain more than 100 addresses. i (as postmaster) have found
two instances in which pine seems unwilling to accept more than about 91
addresses. in particular it only expands part of the 91st addresss causing
sendmail to complain about unbalanced parenthesis.

any help would be appreciated and i can forward an instance of mail being
returned because of the above if it would be of any help.

Pine should be able to handle 1000 addresses by default.  My suggestion
would be to duplicate the problem, then grab a copy of your .pine-debug1
file, .addressbook file and instructions to duplicate the problem to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu or myself...

I've run into the same problem on our system.  It turned out to be
sendmail that was at fault.  I've replaced sendmail with smail3 and the
problem is now gone.

When using sendmail, it is typically the final delivery program (often 
/bin/mail) that escapes the From_ lines.  There is also a per-mailer flag in 
sendmail that will cause it to escape the From_s before it passes the message
to the mailer, if you'd like.  That's the "E" flag.  But I think most people
rely on the actual deliverer to do the job.

I'll take your word for it.  Smail3 comes with a replacement /bin/mail that
I installed along with the rest of the smail3 package.

Hmm, I seem to have answered the wrong question.  My answer about From_ 
lines doesn't apply to the 1000 user mailing list question.  I think 
somebody asked earlier about messages being split into two because 
From_'s at the starts of lines weren't being escaped.  That's what my 
response refers to.  Hope I didn't confuse too many people!

I'll take your word for it.  Smail3 comes with a replacement /bin/mail that
I installed along with the rest of the smail3 package.

Your mail almost certainly failed because you used the wrong username.
It should be pine-info-request. For some inscrutable reason you added
an "s". You should also note that this username is "automated" a la
LISTSERV and you simply mail a one line subscribe request.

A naive question, I realise, from a relative newcomer to the Pine world....

Elm has a "bounce message" feature that works along these lines:
        A sends message to B
        B decides the message is more relevant to C
        B uses "bounce" command to remail message to C
        C receives mail as if it came directly from A
                (meaning they can reply straight to it)

This would be useful in situations such as our Advisory/Help Desk mail drop,
where someone redistributes messages to suitable staff to be dealt with.
Without "bounce" the answering member of staff has to firkle around saving the
message to a file, starting a new message, reading in the old message, etc.,
etc..

Is "bounce" deliberately omitted as part of Pine design philosohpy?  Or is it up
for negotiation with the development team? ;-)

I've considered "bounce" to be a disfeature.  People (including myself)
hit things like reply or group reply expecting them to go to the person
who did the bounce.  I forget about Elm bounce works, but in RiceMail,
the person who does the bouncing can add text at the top of the message
making it every more confusing....  I think "bounce" causes way more
confusion than good.  The *only* case where I think "bounce" is a good thing
is in the hands of a mailing list moderator....

I hope that "bounce" continues to be omitted in PINE.

We originally omitted bounce from Pine for exactly the reasons Billy
points out: bounce (or "remail") is *dangerous* and has caused
considerable embarrassment over the years to unsuspecting recipients who
inadvertently reply to the original poster.  This can be especially 
nasty if the original poster is sending via a LISTSERV where the Reply-To: 
is set to the entire list.  (I've even been bitten, and I *know* better!)

However, as Mike points out, bounce has a legitimate use, especially for 
mailing list and news group moderation.

Our plan is to provide Bounce, but *only* in Old-Growth (power-user) mode. 

I hope this will be viewed as an acceptable compromise.

It's fine if you want to keep pine 'idiot-proof'.  It's a very fine
tool for novices and intermediate skill level users.  Bounce is very
important in *this* users life though, and is why I use Elm.  Some
(even most) folks can be trusted with bounce, especially if it's a
disable-by-default feature.

I think an "old-growth" bounce option is an acceptable compromise. 

I would add that another of those legitimate and necessary uses of
bounce is in using e-mail in a business/office environment where 
there may often be secretaries and other intermediaries inserted 
into the message stream. Those intermediaries would very much like
to be able to remove themselves from that stream - i.e. that don't 
need to personally dispatch EVERY reply - and that requires that 
forwarded ( or 'bounced' ) message keep most of their original headers. 

One reason this may appear to be a 'misfeature' is the lack of 
standard terminology: "forward", "bounce", "remail" , etc. 
( AND lack of presentation/application level standards. ) 

This also, again, raises the problem of the e-mail user who, while not
technically proficient with computers, often needs to do something 
more complicated with email than the typical user. ( The previous 
example I brought up was setting up Sender/From/Reply-To headers 
correctly for secretary sent email - so the boss is the From: ,
the secretary is the Sender:, and both get replies. ) Pine is a 
GREAT naieve user mail program, but it tends to get in the way when
one has to do a bit more. Perhaps when the 'old-growth' mode gets 
filled out with a few more features ... ( or perhaps what that sort
of job really requires is a "programmable" mailer, where local 
policies and options can be set up easily. )

Many people, including myself, would like a few additional features in
Pine.  Usually the small "additional set" is slightly different from
person to person.

If all these changes are put in, even into "old-growth" mode, then one of
the fundamental design points of Pine (a simple mailer, with a simple
on-line manual) will have been lost.  What do the keepers of the "one true
Pine" have to say?

        Huh?   It's just header editing.   I miss it in Pine.   :-(

        And about LISTSERV:  the  Reply-To  can be set to the list
or the sender,  ignoring or respecting any previous  Reply-To.
So you may find that if you simply insert a  "Reply-To: me@myhost"
in the header you won't embarrass your bouncee.

        Smart and flexible  Reply-To  handling is just one of the
features of a  list server  that I consider essential.   I wish we
could get MajorDomo, MAILSERV, and all the various LISTSERV variants
to converge.   There is an effort along this line.

OK, I'll bite. :)

The *theory*, *hope*, and *intent* behind "old-growth" mode was that we 
could retain the "simple mailer" virtues of Pine for most users, but also 
accommodate creaping featurism in a way that didn't undermine the 
original design goal.  

Whether the old-growth approach will actually achieve that goal remains 
to be seen, but there are lots of things we'd like to add to meet local 
needs, and it's clear that there is world-wide interest in many of these 
enhancements.

One of the things we have just been discussing amongst ourselves is
related: We have some options that are configurable by separate variables
in .pinerc. (There will be more! :) And we have some that are "lumped"
together under the feature-level "old-growth".  (More of those coming,
too.) The issue is whether to lean more to the individual options or more
to the lumped options. 

Example: many have asked for a way to turn off confirmations.  This has
led to the idea of a "reckless" (or perhaps "clear-cut"?) mode beyond
"old-growth" where there would be no confirmations, even for irreversable
actions.  Alternatively, it has been suggested that even novices should
have the option of being reckless.  I actually don't agree with the latter
view, having seen what happens to support costs when you make razor blades
easily available to the infirm and inexperienced, but the general issue is
quite valid: to what extent should "old-growth" features be individually
enabled vs. lumped. 

Other examples of power-user features include: bounce, piping to a Unix
cmd, aggregate operations, more complex searching, being able to enter a
msg number without the "J", etc... 

The global .pinerc provides a way to establish a baseline config for a
site, but we don't want to get to the point where there is a big business
opportunity for those wishing to provide personal pine configuration
support.  :)

Comments welcome, as always.

There will never be agreement about all these possible features.  I
believe myself that a Unix mailer that doesn't allow everyone to pipe to a
command is seriously disenfranchising the user because s/he can't have
easy access to the powerfull Unix tools...

What can we do when our students leave for holiday this summer.  Is there
some way to return mail to the sender when the student is gone?  We will
be leaving their accounts on the system and I am afraid that the disk will
fill up with unread mail.  Is there a way after /spool/mail/<user> get so
big that we can return to sender as not accepting mail?

This isn't really pine-related, but...

Yes - disk quotas.

I approve whole-heartedly with Pine's creating user-debugging files by
default, but could the -d0 option be made to mean 0, ie no debug file?

Some space-conscious users have grumbled about the cumulative effect of
storing 4 x 4k files x thousands of users. (Of course all those 16k's are
a drop in the ocean, but if you've just hit your quota or someone else has
just filled your disk partition it's one more aggravation!)

Thanks for pine. I'm using pine from PCs - with PCNFS, a batch file and a
keyboard stuffer I can be on our Unix box and into pine and use it almost
as if it were a DOS program (even nicer if I could rsh it). I also use
ReadMail, a DOS off-line mail reader, like many programs on DOS it doesn't
care whether lines end in CR, LF or both. But unfortunately it can't
append selected messages in Unix format to a file - so when I save
messages to mail folders with ReadMail they have CRLF. Pine then
identifies the mail folder as of unknown format and I have to run the
folder through a DOS2UNIX conversion. Similarly, if I ^R a DOS text file
into a message I get lots of ^Ms to delete out.

Any chance of pine accepting CRLF as a valid end of line. (Or is the
option hidden away somewhere obvious that I haven't seen). Maybe it's a
kludge but it should be fairly simple (? :-)) and you must be tackling it
in PC pine.

I know you are working on a PC Pine, but with a networked PC I think I
might still prefer to run pine on the unix box.

G'day

1. Once pine 3.07 is compiled with debugging turned on how does one turn it
off? I commented out the DEBUG= line in makfile.sun, deleted the existing
executable, and rebuilt but debugging is still on.

2. On a Sun Sparcstation (SunOS 4.1.2), which is the main mail machine for
our domain, we have no /usr/local/lib/pine.conf file and I have optioned
the line governing use of domain name only in my .pinerc file no, ie use
the host and the domain name in the from line (this was done just as a
test -- I really do want it to be from user@domain-name). As a result I
expected to see user@hostname.domain-name in the from field but didnt. Why
is this? This sun is also the primary name server for our domain and is
configured with an MX record for the domain, an A record for the domain
listing this hosts ip address along with the A record for the host itself. 

Thanks,

Greg

Dear Pine-Central,

  This is not really a pine question as such, but comes about because of
Pine's marvelous ability to neatly organize one's incoming mail.  I save 
incoming mail as "from.name", where "name" is the person or organization
sending me mail.  I now have 3 Meg of old mail in 100+ files.

   --> I need to clean out old mail.  How best to do it? <---

I would like to go thru every mail file and delete all messages older than
say 6 months.  Is there some way to do this from within pine?  Some other
program out there that does this?  A Unix utility that I don't know about?
Help!

Jeff,
In a recent pine-info discussion Mike Kuniavsky had the following 
suggestion:

"There's a piece of software called mailclean (in comp.sources.misc volume
22, available at all of the usual places or check archie) which removes
"old" (definable) mail after a set period of time from mailboxes, leaving
all of the other mail."

Hope this helps.

A related suggestion: How about a menu item to compress (.Z) the selected mail
folder?
 
Another related suggestion: How about a .pinerc option to keep each mail
folder compressed when not in use?

For interactive housecleaning:
Mush ( Mail Users SHell ) has more powerful selection & sorting &
marking capabilities - and commands can be 'piped' together, as 
in unix shells ( except that, from one mush command to another,
what is passed is a message LIST, not the messages, but when you
pipe a message list to a unix command, it is the messages that 
get sent. ) 
  'pipe -i -s unsubscribe | delete ' 
for example, will delete all the messages with "unsubscribe" in the
subject line ( -i is (following 'grep') case insensitivity ).

For Batch housecleaning I've used both 'filter' - a program that comes
with the mush package, and 'procmail/formail'. Both are really designed
to intercept incomming mail ( via an entry in your .forward file ) and 
route it to a particluar folder|user|program, but both can be run in 
"batch" mode. The usual .forward method simply runs the program with
a mail message as the stdin. That's where the 'formail' program 
( part of 'procmail' package ) comes in handy : formail can split up
a mailbox file, and pipe each message to a unix command:

  'formail <mbx -s procmail ./.procmailrc' 

will break up mailbox file "mbx" into separate messages and pipe each
one to the command 'procmail ./.procmailrc' , where ".procmailrc" is 
a file of procmail rules. 


[ Both procmail and filter need a "rule" file to pick and redirect  
  messages.  ]

	In a former life   ;-) 
I was able to log all outbound and (by default) 
inbound messages into a notebook called  yyyymon, 
where yyyy is the year and mon is the three-letter month. 
So today's notebook is  "1993may". 
 
	I've found this month-by-month logging 
very convenient.   I can now move all of 1992xxx 
from my mailbox sub-directory to, say, tape or floppy 
to put into cold storage.   (sure ... compresss it too) 
But I haven't yet figured out how,  with Pine, 
to automate the rotation of notebook names.

This is a suggestion for pine that I just had.  It might be even
relatively simple to implement.

In the address menu, I'd like to be able to associate a specific,
alternate signature with an alias. 

Reason:  I am the administrator of a few mailing lists and other project
and I use an alias to mail to them because I'm too lazy to typein the
whole name (which is the purpose, of course).  unfortunately, if I want to
have some kind of a different .signature (for example, a reminder of FTP
information), I have to ^k out the normal .sig, and then ^r in the
replacement.

If I could withint the address menu designate a seperate .signature, it
would save that hassle.  If no .sig is designated, it would simply use the
default.

Does that make any sense?  (it is 2:30 am).

Try ftp.cac.washington.edu.  There are several binaries there (including
NeXT and Sun), but I'm not sure about one for SCO.  They should be in the
/pine directory, with the source code.

Later...(I hope my memory serves me right! :-) )

	Well I'm truly tickled.   Thanks to the Pine developers 
for supporting  "the escape sequences for a number of conventions". 
This is a good thing to do.   Can/do you extend these?   I notice 
that you  "[do] not use termcap to discover them",  and I agree 
with this,  but would suggest augmenting the built-ins with the 
definitions in termcap,  when possible. 
 
	Can I remap these?   The doc doesn't say so.   I'm very 
happy that I don't have to  control-this  and  control-that  always, 
but sometimes I'm on a wierd keyboard and have to fall-back to 
non-function-key mode.   I'd rather STAY in function-key mode. 
One solution is to have two-stroke alternatives to the function keys: 
 
		<ESC>1		F1 
		<ESC>2		F2 
		<ESC>3		F3 
		<ESC>4		F4 
		<ESC>5		F5 
		<ESC>6		F6 
		<ESC>7		F7 
		<ESC>8		F8 
		<ESC>9		F9 
		<ESC>0		F10 
		<ESC>-		F11 
		<ESC>=		F12 
 
	I don't especially *like* the above list,  but it's nice 
to have for those times when I'm on a strange terminal (or emulator) 
or somehow have TERM= temporarily messed-up.

This is odd.  Pine (3.05) didn't want to show me this message, printing

[ Part 1 Unknown text "Latin-1" 33 lines ]
[ Can not display ... ]

but if I toggle 'full headers' on I see the message!  Without any
character munging or other oddities, as far as I can tell. 

Now this doesn't seem consistent.  Either Pine can't cope with this
message, or it really can and I'd rather it just showed it to me without
this 'Can not display' business.  (Maybe with a grumble about 'Latin-1',
if it must.) In either case I don't see why toggling the headers command
should make a difference. 

Is this handled differently in 3.07?

Would it be possible for you to use a standard charset name in the future?
It is annoying to have to convert every message you send before I can read
it.  I know you have asked for Latin-1, but that is not defined in the
MIME standard yet.  What you should be using is US-ASCII or ISO-8859-x
(x=1-9).  Until the specification for Latin-1 is published in an RFC and
registered with IANA it should not be used in Internet mail (paraphrased
from RFC1341, pg20).

As for the answer to your question, there were some utilities mentioned on
this list a couple days ago that should do the job for you...

I can't say for sure, but I suspect that we are seeing different
assumptions in the two modes.  If you notice, the original message used an
invalid charset=Latin-1 in the Content-type header.  In normal mode, pine
assumes that the user would rather not see munged up text from some
unsupported charset (Kanji, vietnamese, Klingon, etc), whereas in 'full
headers' mode the user usually wants to see as much info as possible. 
Even though the Latin-1 used *could* have been displayed, I think it is
safer to assume the worst (especially with novice users).  The appropriate
charset for the original message would have been US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1.

While we're at it, does anybody have the svr4 patches for 3.07?  Are there
any plans to make svr4 one of the standard platforms for pine?

I have the same problem.

Nope.  I'm using 3.07.

I believe this has been discussed before here, and I believe that it
doesn't work because Latin-1 is not part of the MIME standard...RIGHT?  (I
think...something like that...)

Later...

Brett...

I have compiled Pine 3.05 and 3.07 on both 386BSD and NetBSD machines. 
The NetBSD compiled without a hitch using the BSD build platform.  It took
just a little hacking of the makefile for 386BSD...I had to change a

I'm using pine 3.05. It'd be nice to be able to:

    q quit from the folder screen
    i index (on highlighted folder) from the folder screen
    not have pine say [Unknown command: "f"] from folder screen (just
         ignore the "f" there)
    not have pine say [Unknown command: "m"] from the main menu
         (again, ignore it)

I get the below message from pine for Rick Troth's mail:

>>  [Part 1, Unknown text "Latin-1"  18 lines]
>>  [Can not display this part. Use the "A" command to save in a file]

But if I do a forward or a reply (include message), it puts the text in
there! It says it can't display it, but yet it includes it. What gives?

BTW, is there an ftp'able SVR4 port of Pine?

1. The vt100 and vt200 terminals have select, insert, remove  keys. They
   are easy to use. pine (pico) should work with them. The C-k is  C-u
   not enough

2. There could be some Do-key and some extra commands with english words
   Compare to MAX/VMS eve (tpu) editor. It has some direct keys
   to do mos editing - but there is alo the do + english word command
   It is easy for people to learn. I do not mean the Do key on VT200.
   It could be any key in princible. 

3. In Address book the commands are a little complicated. There are

? Help       M Main Menu  T AddToList   - Prev Pg     A Add         D Delete
             S CreateList L Print   SPACE Next Pg     E Edit        W Where is

Why is there two types of lists? I see only one type actually:

nickname,comment,list of user address(es)

If there is more than one name in the "list" it is a list.

Maybe there is some programming (mail system) technical reason, but why
irritate users with it?

After this you need few simple commands:

1. create new nicname
2. add more addresses to the nicname (the line cursor is pointing)
3. edit (the field cursor is pointing, address, nicname, name)
4. print address book
5. delete (the field cursor is pointing, address,nicname,...)

I think in elm there is only one type of address book entry. Why have you
added one more?

hi : does pine have problems with the "quoted-printable" form of mime
encoding. i ask because of the following context:

we are using pine on a symetry sequent box running ptx 2.2.0. we have
versions of both wordperfect 5.0 and wordperfect 5.1 available. we have no
problem sending wp5.0 files as attachments and pine uses BASE64 as the
encoding method for these files. when we attempt to send wp51 files as
attachments pine seems to pick the files up properly (it gets the right
size) but only the first few bytes (about 6 or 7 bytes) are recieved by the
recipient. pine is using quoted-printable to encode these wp51 files.

Any help would be appreciated.

Yep, Latin-1 is not part of MIME. Currently recognized char sets are
US-ASCII and ISO-8859-x.

Pine 3.0x has some known "quirks" in MIME encoding/decoding.  Pine 4.0
will have much improved MIME support...

Not all terminals support these features.  One of the key objectives of
the pine design was to make it consistent for everyone.  I suppose that
the above functionality could be turned on with function-key support
though.

Another objective of Pine is to keep it as simple as possible.  If you
start adding a bunch of extended commands, you would be better off to just
use emacs...

There are not two types of lists.  There are single entries and
distribution lists.  Although I suppose you could make single entries a
list of one, it makes more sense to me to distinguish between them.  Our
users, most of whom are novices, seem to have no trouble with the way
it is set up now...

Where does this differ from what is there now?

        I've been doing that,  but it has taken no small amount of time.
Perhaps I should have tried to shorten the path and not review  ALL
of the ietf-822 archives.   But you are correct,  and I'd appreciate it
if more folks did  not  make the mistake that I appear to be making.

        Thanks for the corrected reference.

        Look ... I sincerely don't mean to be a whiner or to beat the
skeletal remains of yet-another-dead-horse,  but I  DON'T  see closure
on it and  DO  see  a solution / solution(s).   But I am a newcomer
(for reasons which escape me).

        Any user of Pine 3.05 (and as far as I can tell 3.07 or 2.x)
can shoot themself in the foot  (head if you prefer)  by setting
character-set = Zeldas_private_codepage.   Should the Pine developers
remove this feature?   I think not.   Leave it open-ended.

        Pine tries to do MIME;  that's how this thread crossed.   Sorry.

        Small ROT is that software should generate the cleanest possible
protocol while accepting as much as possible and silently ignoring whatever
doesn't make sense but is otherwise harmless.   So,  yeah,  my  .pinerc
was broken and I'm a jerk for ruining everyone's day,  but that's balanced
against my former life on a  US-ASCII_is_foreign  system along with the
legitimate goal of leaving Pine (and everything) as open ended as possible.

        I'll subscribe to  ietf-charsets  and =just listen= until I have
some handle on the reality there.   Meantime,  every MIME compliant MUA
is causing numerous (not all) mail gateways to deliver incorrect data.
I WOULD NOT  ask any of these MUAs to stop [mis]labelling their mail,
but I would like to get the problem corrected.   A short-term solution
is to leave CHARSET= off if it's not absolutely essential.

        Sorry for the confusion resulting from  "Latin-1".

        Here's the original message,  hopefully in readable form.

Rick Troth <troth@rice.edu>,  Rice University,  Information Systems
----------------------------Original message----------------------------
        Well I'm truly tickled.   Thanks to the Pine developers
for supporting  "the escape sequences for a number of conventions".
This is a good thing to do.   Can/do you extend these?   I notice
that you  "[do] not use termcap to discover them",  and I agree
with this,  but would suggest augmenting the built-ins with the
definitions in termcap,  when possible.

        Can I remap these?   The doc doesn't say so.   I'm very
happy that I don't have to  control-this  and  control-that  always,
but sometimes I'm on a wierd keyboard and have to fall-back to
non-function-key mode.   I'd rather STAY in function-key mode.
One solution is to have two-stroke alternatives to the function keys:

                <ESC>1          F1
                <ESC>2          F2
                <ESC>3          F3
                <ESC>4          F4
                <ESC>5          F5
                <ESC>6          F6
                <ESC>7          F7
                <ESC>8          F8
                <ESC>9          F9
                <ESC>0          F10
                <ESC>-          F11
                <ESC>=          F12

        I don't especially *like* the above list,  but it's nice
to have for those times when I'm on a strange terminal (or emulator)
or somehow have TERM= temporarily messed-up.

All vt100 and vt200 terminals do have those keys and good vt100 & vt200
emulators also. I do not see why vt200 users are not allowed to use the
select/remove/insert keys when they are much more easy to use than the
C-k/C-u keys.

Emacs is awfull for a novice to use - compare it to VAX/VMS EVE/TPU! 

You mean that program with a lot of possibilities can not be simple to use?
I disagree. Program can be big and include a lot of featuers and be very
easy to use at the same time. EVE/TPU in VAX/VMS is one example of that
kind of program. It includes most emacs features but it is quite simple to
use.

1. Now you have 2 create commands: Add and CreateList
In my succestion there is only one.

2. Novice has a problem if he wants add one name to the alias, he must
delete it and create a list.
In my succestion there is no problem.

3. The function of command Add is not very clear: Does it add a name to
list or new alias?

4. When you create a list command is CreateList (That is clear)
When you create a alias, the command is Add (Add what and where? That is
not clear if you do not read docs, and they do not.)

Maybe the biggest problem is in the command names. But I do not see any
reason for why there is alias and list. Why there is two types of entries
in the address book when only one is needed?

I'd like to ask a question about this support.  Will it include fall-back
to metamail?  This would seem to be desirable so that if, say, our site
puts in new support for viewing and sending faxes using MIME, it can be
immediately available with all our mailers.

Andrew,
The intention is to implement the "mailcap" facility, similar to what is 
in Nathaniel's metamail distribution.  It is indeed our goal to be able to 
add support for new subtypes without changing Pine.  Ideally, we'd like 
to be able to handle printing as well as viewing via the mailcap 
facility, and have a way to pipe output back into a Pine browser window, 
so you do support PEM, etc, by just adding the appropriate table entry.
(It's much easier if you can assume a multi-window display.)
We haven't yet determined whether we can achieve those functional goals 
in a way that is upward compatible with the existing mailcap definition.

I have done some tests on this, even using other editors etc but pine
seems to insist on leaving a couple of blank lines at the end of each
mail item. This causes problems with some list management software that
we run here.

Other MUAs don't seem to have this feature/problem.

Any ideas?

This may be a bug in Pine 3.05. There was a version of Pine that had a bug
attaching files with NULL characters in them. It would behave as you
described. I think it was fixed in a version after 3.05, though I don't
know for certain if it's in Pine 3.07.  I'd suggest giving it a try.

On the old-growth mode:
     Seems like things that change the behavior of existing
  commands should have separate options in the .pinerc and not be
  lumped in to old-growth mode.  An example of this would be
  turning off the confirmation questions (only silly for some users). 

    Additions to Pine, like adding the bounce command, the pipe
  command, MIME style forwarding, additional information displays
  etc. can be lumped together. The main reason to relegate these to
  old-growth mode is so the novice user will not be confronted by
  more commands than they can make sense of. 

On the bounce command:
    Seems like there's several things the bounce command can be used for:
    - resending a message that didn't make it because of an incorrect address
    - management of a mailing list
    - others??
  
  Resending a returned message currently involves pulling it out of sent-mail
  and sending it on.  When this is done the original sender and the
  "re-sender" are the same.  Maybe the resend command can be added with 
  a confirmation question (or even prohibition) if the original sender and the
  "re-sender" are different.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

Latin-1 is just a more people friendly name for ISO-8859-1.  For example
Pine describes iso-8859-6 as "Latin and Arabic text". 

The valid setting for the character-set parameter are "iso-8859-x" and
us-ascii.  Pine understands a little about these character sets, like the
fact that iso-8859-1 through iso-8859-9 all have the lower 128 characters
the same as us-ascii.  In this case Pine will display those characters
that it can and won't display the ones it can't.  For example, if you got
a message in iso-8859-6 it would display the us-ascii characters but term
the Arabic characters into "_", unless of course you had locally set your
character set to iso-8859-6.  In that case Pine would send all the Arabic
(8 bit) characters to your screen). 

When you choose a character set that Pine knows nothing about, like
"Latin-1" or perhaps "ISO-THAI" (if it existed) then it assumes it is not
possible to display it on the screen at all.  That is, unless the
character set of the message matches the characters set that Pine is
configured for.  This is why none of us but Rick could see Rick's message. 

The short of it is, if you want to do Latin-1 or ISO-8859-1 text and you
have an X-terminal or a vt200, vt300... terminal that supports this
characters set, Pine will work, but you should have
"character-set=iso-8859-1" in your .pinerc.  There are however, a few bugs
with this, such as postponing the message.

Most of this is based on what is specified in the MIME standard for
handling various character sets.

Hope this makes sense!

	Rerouting messages that were sent to the "wrong" person.  If I
([y]) receive a message from user [x] that really is more appropriate
for user [z], I want to change:

[x] -> [y]

	...to:

[x] -> [z]

	Using forward is unacceptable, because it instead produces:

[x] -> [y] -> [z]

	I don't often have cause to do something like this, but when I
do, "bounce" is about the only thing that does it effectively.

This is in fact quite common.  There are a growing number of people
who read mail from a generic address mailbox and direct it to the
appropriate party (some Postmaster mail, user help desk, "general

is the best for these cases.

This is almost certainly a bad idea, especially if (as Rick
implied in another part of the referenced message) the user can do
so by setting a default charset value in a user configuration file
somewhere.  (If users dink with the message headers themselves,
all bets are off.)

> Should the Pine developers remove this feature?

I'm not sure what the feature in question is, but if it's
something which lets users specify the value to be sent out as the
MIME Content-Type: charset, I think it's a bad idea, and should be
removed or significantly altered.

An easy mistake to make (I speak from experience) is to assume
that the charset parameter on a MIME Content-Type: line encodes
the character set used by the entity composing the message, or
the character set to be used by the entity displaying the
message. I find that the best way to think about charset is that
it is *neither*.  charset is an octet-based encoding used during
message transfer; it need bear no relation to the composing or
viewing character sets.  In the most general case, a message will
be composed using some native character set, translated
automatically to a MIME-registered charset, and translated at the
other end into a native display character set.  It should be more
likely that the charset value be selected by an automaton, not by
a human.

(If anyone finds the above paragraph startling, you're welcome to
write to me for clarification.  I'm not going to prolong this
message with additional explanations right now.)

It's not necessarily *wrong* to think of charset as having
something to do with the composing or viewing character set (in
many cases, not coincidentally, all three will be identical), but
it is very easy to make conceptual mistakes, implement
nonconformant software, or just generally misunderstand how MIME
is supposed to work if you don't explicitly separate in your mind
the concepts of composing/viewing character sets and transmission
charsets.  (You'll notice that I reinforce this distinction in my
own head and in this message by using the terms "character set"
and "charset" noninterchangeably.)

The charset situation is much like the canonical CRLF situation:
the fact that the canonical representation is identical to some
but not all of the available local representations guarantees
misunderstandings.

To be sure, automated selection of and translation to a registered
MIME charset is a non-trivial task, and mailers which are trying
to adopt MIME right away cannot be faulted for deferring
development of such functionality for a while.  However, just
letting users specify non-default, non-7-bit-US-ASCII, (non-MIME)
charsets is an open invitation to misunderstanding and
noninteroperability.

For now, composition agents which wish to allow users to use
extended character sets (such as Latin-1), but which elect to
relegate character set and/or charset selection to the user,
should either present the user with a menu of registered MIME
charsets from which to select (presumably it will be up to the
user to ensure that the editor or composition tool is actually
using a character set corresponding to the selected charset), or
(in the case of what it sounds like PINE is doing) at least filter
the user's open-ended charset selection against the list of
registered values (and perhaps also the X- pattern).

I've copied this message to the IETF character sets mailing list
(ietf-charsets@innosoft.com, subscription requests to
ietf-charsets-request@innosoft.com); any followup traffic should
be sent there, and *not* to the ietf-822 list.

Steve -

     Thanks for your comments.  You needn't convince me; I've been involved
with the MIME charset issue for a long time (you'll note that I am one of the
authors of the ISO-2022-JP spec).  In defense of the other Pine team members,
the sin is one of omission rather than of comission; they wanted to do
something about character sets and didn't want to wire in a table of legal
values (since it might change).

     I've suggested that as a first pass the charset should only be settable
in the system config file, and that the charset always be coerced to US-ASCII
unless the text contains 8-bit characters and/or has ``funny'' control
characters such as ESC or SI/SO.  More work would definitely be needed in this
area, but you'll appreciate that there are other, higher priorities just
now...

I haven't followed this discussion, but Pine does do a few things with
character sets.  For example if you set Pine to use ISO-8859-1 and send an
all ASCII message it will tag it US-ASCII (instead of ISO-8859-1).  Also,
it's smart enough to display the lower 128 for all incoming messages in
the ISO-8859-X characters sets and greek the ones it can't if the
character set of the receiving Pine is US-ASCII or ISO-8859-X.  Thought
that was what required for minimal MIME compliance.

Hope I haven't upgraded the sin from omission to comision....

I've got a number of users, who have access to the UNIX box at the local
university, who just love PINE; I've been impressed with what I've seen.
Unfortunately we are a VAX/VMS shop; sooooo, my question is to what 
extent anyone out there is working on a VMS port.

Hi Laurence -

     Perhaps all that is needed is a list in the system .pinerc file of all
the valid charsets, and not let the user set her charset to one that is not in
the list.  So, perhaps Pine could have US-ASCII, ISO-2022-JP, and the various
ISO-8859-x sets wired in as an initial list, and the system file specify
additional valid sets?

     The concern is to avoid letting users do things like set it to things
such as ``Latin-1'' or ``ASCII'' or similar bogons...

     What do you think?

When we were demoing UNIX PINE (as well as other items) for my boss today,
a very good suggestion came out.  The main menu should have a highlight
bar that can be moved around like the mail index screen does.  It would
make the program more consisent.

I started looking at doing porting the Pine client program (*not* the imapd
server, which is non-trivial) to work with DEC's UCX software (now "TCP/IP
Services for VMS" (sic)).

I managed to get the c-client stuff to compile up with little bother and
successfully.  However I got floored by the screen management stuff and getting
sinlge keystrokes back (VAXC has a minimalist idea of what to provide for
compatibility in the way of Curses and/or Terminfo routintes)

Someone at Washington is rumoured to have some SMG code tucked away in an
archive somewhere that may be useful (if you know how to program with SMG!)

If anyone does get a Pine client working ON VAX/VMS (ideally over UCX from our
point of view) PLEASE let me know... We would really like this, as we could then
access our IMAP-served mailboxes on UNIX from our VAX/VMS systems.

Many PC users here have PCNFS. Its telnet sends an "interrupt process" on
Ctrl-C in much the same way as the Mac NCSA telnet. Unlike NCSA telnet
however, it does not seem possible to redefine this key/signal combination.
This leads to obvious problems when trying to cancel anything in Pine. Can
anyone suggest a work-around or do I need to hack Pine?

I received a gripe from one of our computer consualts:

Indeed it's annoying.  Pine is inconsistent:  when elm-style-save=yes
is set, the automatic (by sender) folders are created in the proper
mail directory.  However, when a new, non-default folder name is
specified, it is created in the home directory.  Mail and mush have a
short way to specify the folder in the mail directory (prepending a "+"
to the name), while elm uses "=" for the same purpose.


And I have a request from my boss:  a way to tell pine to save a certain 
group of users into one folder (by default).  The group is associated
with an alias, which would be a good default name.  Maybe another field
in the .addressbook (idea stollen from mail in VM)?

I think I saw this a while ago, but don't remember the solution. Our
computing services have just upgraded the dial-up lines to 8bit. This of
course is a good thing...except it has made a rather odd error in PINE and
PICO. When dialing in on Macs the return key seems to get translated as a
control-J or Justify not as a return. In the command line the return key
works great. This problem only exists in PINE. Is there a way to remap the
return character? stty? I know I have vt100 terminal emulation.

I too would like to see a Pine client for VMS, and I can volunteer some
expertise in the screen management and keystroke areas (gained through
work on the VMS port of the gopher client software).

If you'ld like to collaborate on this, I can take what you've done so far,
and see how much further I can get.

Yes, I think that's exactly right.  We can probably adjust the comment in
the .pinerc for now.  In the long term the .pinerc needs a lot of good
error checking.  It just hasn't been done because limited resources.

The bsd port of pine has an (apparently) undefined entity, LPASS8,
that is used in ttyin.c for handling 8-bit data.

Any ideas for what the (correct) value of LPASS8 should be in this context?

We have the same problem in one of our dorms...  The only way to fix it
for us is to tell it to go to a machine called bucc1 from the DIAL:
prompt, and then from there to telnet to camelot... otherwise, whenever
you hit return, a Ctrl-J is generated... They're using really old (slow)

It turns out is a problem in the terminal server (a cisco server by the
way). I was connecting via a telnet session that was doing odd translation
of return characters. I needed to "rlogin" and bring the default vt100
environment with me. Thanks Syracuse Computing (John Wobus) for the answer.

        Although I used this to defend my action of having used an
illegitimate CHARSET,  I do  NOT  think that all  "user can shoot
themself in the foot"  features are bad.   Specifically,  I feel
(quite strongly)  that the user should be able to specify any old
charset and have display at least attempted at the other end.

        The long term solution is,  of course,  to map between
"character sets"  (which the use should have control over)  and
"charsets"  (which the user should leave alone).

        My only request of Pine from all this noise is that Pine
NOT LABEL  messages of  Content-Type:  text/plain.
(this may be counter to RFC 1341;  is it?)

>> Should the Pine developers remove this feature?

        No.

        Right.   I maintain that CHARSET specification should be
omitted when feasible.   This is because there are such things as
gateways which translate the SMTP octet-stream into anything.

        There are two goals:  1)  to be able to specify new and/or
extended character sets  (and mark-ups and other extensions to plain text)
and  2)  to use  "plain text"  (in mail)  as a transport medium.
For the former,  use  Base64  encoding when needed.   For the latter,
don't label the text  "ASCII"  or any other codepoint mapping if there's
any way on earth that it might get translated by a gateway.

        I don't think this is making sense and I can't find the words.
Steve apparently has:   charset -vs- character_set.

        Plain text  is defined differently from system to system.
On UNIX,  plain text is ASCII (now ISO-8859-1) with lines delimited by
NL (actually LF).   On NT,  plain text is 16 bits wide  (so I hear).
That ain't ASCII,  though we could be the high-order 8 bits for much
of plain text processing,  and that's fine by me.   (memory is cheap)
On VM/CMS,  plain text is EBCDIC (now CodePage 1047) and records are
handled by the filesystem out-of-band of the data,  so NL (and LF and CR)
aren't sacred characters.   Now ... "mail is plain-text,  not ASCII".

        Right!   99 times out of 100 you don't care,  but there's that
1% of the time when you've called it  US-ASCII  and it's  NOT anymore,
although it  *is*  still legitimate  "plain text".

        Thanks.   That helps.

        Right!   And this thinking,  carried into MIME  (thus this
should be kicked BACK TO the IETF-822 list,  but I refrain),  shows up
in the use of  CHARSET=ISO-8859-1  rather than  CHARACTER_SET=Latin-1.
If you specify  "Latin-1",  then you can  (must;  I'm arguing for a
definition here,  not an explanation)  assume that  SMTP  will carry it
as ISO-8859-1,  BUT THE RECEIVING  (or sending)  HOST MIGHT NOT.
(and yes,  sad but true,  any SMTPs will strip the high bit)

>To be sure, automated selection of and translation to a registered

        Yes.   Which is why I want  routers, gateways,  and all  MTAs
(mail transfer agents)  to stay out of it.   That's why I ask that
(today,  1993)  we  NOT LABEL  true plain text as  US-ASCII/ISO-8859-1.
Just leave it alone and let it default at the receiving end.

        And let me reiterate that I'm not mad at the Pine developers
(nor the MIME developers;  not mad at anyone,  just trying to push a
point that I think is important and has been missed).   I'm very pleased
with Pine.   It can almost replace RiceMAIL.

        Steve,  it's obvious from your distinction between character set
(set of characters)  and  charset  (encoding of characters)  that you
understand this issue.   Thanks for making up and using those labels!

I see none of this inconsistency. Are you sure that the user has
mail-directory set correctly in .pinerc?

We've recently moved from using a Rice-Mail lookalike on VM to elm
on Unix. The inability to associate particular users with folders
is a feature which many of our users miss. This association should
give user-dependent default folders when the user sends mail
(i.e. in the Fcc: field) and when the user "Save"s mail using the S
command. I'd therefore strongly support Oved's request for this
enhancement.

Please, gentlemen.....read the RFC.
As long as you send mail over the Internet, claiming MIME compatibility,
the bits on the wire have to conform to the MIME convention, *NOT* to
the local convention, whatever that is.

The omission of a character set label from text/plain
MEANS THAT THE CHARACTER SET IS US ASCII.

A message that contains characters with the high bit set CANNOT BE US-ASCII,
and therefore, a text/plain message without a charset= label in it
that has such characters IS NOT LEGAL MIME.
So, when SMTP strips the 8th bit, it gets what it deserves.

This was ******NOT******* an oversight. This was deliberate design,
designed to promote interoperability. The proliferation of mail in strange
character sets without labels is *exactly* one of the things that the MIME
effort was meant to *remove*.

End of flame..............if you want a couple of tons more, read the
archives of the SMTP and RFC-822 groups. The last flareup is hidden under
"unknown-7bit" and "unknown-8bit" discussions.

Thank you Harald.  MIME is MIME is MIME.  And if it violates the RFC it
isn't MIME and shouldn't pretend to be.

That was the point of my original cryptic comment.  Now PLEASE edit my
address out of the headers of this.  And probably all of those other
mailinglists and limit to pine-info.  PLEASE.

Thankyou.

I have a problem where a MIME mesage from PMDF 4.2 sent to a PINE 3.07 mailer
causes PINE to core dump if I try to forward or reply to the message.  This
also happens to Pine 3.05.  I cannot forward you the message (problem above)
so will cut and paste what is on my screen.

Here is what I see when I read the message via PINE (I have removed message
text):

Here is when it dies.  I have attempted to forward the message and I say
non-mime when prompted by PINE as to whether or not to forward it as a MIME
message (maybe this is the problem?).  I just tried saying forward as a MIME
message and it works.

So is the problem me saying do not forward as a MIME message?  Or should Pine
handle it anyway?  I do not think that PMDF is causing this, it just
happens to be the mailer the message was sent from.

This is a bug in Pine, but the information you've provided is inadequate to
fix the problem.  I will need the actual message to reproduce the problem.

We were aware of a bug in 3.05 that caused this behavior, but we thought we
fixed it in 3.07.

Please make the message available to me and I will fix the problem.

Please do not post Pine problems to the info-pmdf list. Pine has nothing to do
with PMDF, and regardless of what message it gets from whatever source, should
never have occasion to core dump.

Hi, 
 
	I've been moving notebooks from one system to another 
and find that sometimes the  blank line  after the header 
isn't  *really*  empty,  there's a single <SPACE> character. 
Developers,  if you would,  please cause Pine to treat a line 
with only white-space  (any mixture of SPACEs and TABs, 
but nothing else)  to be a valid header delimiter line. 
 
	Thanks!

This is not a good idea.

A header line with only white-space has a specific meaning in RFC-822.  It is
a continuation line with empty text.  I have seen messages which deliberately
do this (e.g. in the Comments: header).  Such messages conform to RFC-822.  A
non-null header delimiter line does not.

In effect, you are asking that a bug be introduced in Pine to work around a
bug in some other software.  The proper thing to do is to fix that other
software.

If it weren't for the fact that this had negative consequences, it might be
considered as a robustness feature.  But, to be considered as a robustness
feature, a proposed function can not break something that is already valid.

	I've seen people get touchy about the code they write...but this one
takes the cake.  

	James mentions at the end of his first message that:

"I do not think that PMDF is causing this, it just happens to be the mailer
the message was sent from."

	The guy just wanted to cover all bases and fully describe the problem.
Also, even if it isn't a PMDF problem (heaven forbid!) maybe someone in that
group would/could have offered assistance.

	Up until James talked about PMDF I didn't know it existed.  When
I first saw his message I thought about taking a look to see what kind of
package it is.  But, considering the 'my product can't be at fault' attitude
I seem to be detecting....I'm not so sure it is worth it.  I'd rather stick
with pine and its authors who are humble and gracious.

Your assumption here is incorrect -- I neither said nor implied anything
whatsoever about either my code or anyone else's. Please reread my original
posting if this isn't clear.

The situation is very simple. The info-pmdf list is a very active one, with
lots of messages about PMDF. We are constantly under fire for cluttering up
people's mailboxes with issues that are clearly unrelated to PMDF. Readers of
info-pmdf constantly send me mail about the lack of focus of the list, and they
constantly urge me to try to keep the discussion focused on products that the
list is intended to discuss.

Posting of material that is quite clearly not a PMDF problem on the info-pmdf
list is inappropriate. Period. I was simply pointing out this basic fact, and
thus far I've received two private messages commending me for taking this
stance for a change. I usually don't and I usually get yelled at a lot for it.

>	James mentions at the end of his first message that:

I'm sorry, I just don't buy it. This argument leads directly to every message
no matter what the subject being posted to every mailing list in existence,
since there there's a faint chance that someone on some list might just have
some additional insight into the problem.

Or perhaps we should have limited things to the software involved. Let's see,
we could have crossposted to info-vax, info-multinet, and probably to an
assortment of UNIX-related and hardware-related lists. Perhaps some newsgroups
like comp.lang.c and comp.lang.pascal could be added because of the languages
the various products are written in. These things could also comprise part of
the problem, and the readers of those lists might be able to offer some
insight, right?

The real problem is that such crossposting can actually work -- you reach a
wider audience and the likelihood of someone knowing how to fix the problem
really is greater. But the cost is great and this far outweighs the benefit.

As for this being a PMDF problem, how could it possibly be a PMDF problem? 
Pine dumped core. Even if a PMDF bug offered up an endless stream of binary
trash in response to some Pine action it is still bogus for Pine to dump core.
Not dumping core no matter what the provocation is a fundamental property of
all robust software, and both my own use of Pine as well as everything I've
heard about it leads me to believe that it is intended to be very robust and
capable.

No such attitude was expressed or implied. I did not say that PMDF is not what
is causing the problem -- it probably is what is causing the problem. But
PMDF's actions are irrelevant; no matter what PMDF does Pine should not dump
core because of it.

You are of course entitled to your opinion. However, you should be aware of a
couple of things. First, James posts quite frequently to the info-pmdf list
with genuine PMDF issues. This is what the list is for and as far as I know I
have always responded quickly and informatively to the questions he has brought
up.

You might also want to consider what the Pine maintainers would say if we
constantly discussed PMDF on the info-pine list.

In conclusion, I was simply taking a position numerous info-pmdf readers and
users of the product have asked me to take on such matters. Thus far, your lone
voice is the one dissenting view, and I find your conclusions to be
unwarranted, your arguments to be specious, and your position to be untenable.

I've checked again.  It's OK when elm-style-save=no,  and only happen
when elm-style-save=yes.

All of the RFC 1345 character sets are registered for MIME use.
That should be able to cover most needs.

Innosoft has ported imapd to VMS.  I am curious why this is so difficult,
since imapd has no network knowledge and just uses stdio.  There's a few
UNIXisms in imapd, nothing really major.

Contact Ned Freed <NED@INNOSOFT.COM> for more information.

We are in the process of setting up a machine which is to act as a mail
server for a large population. Users will access their mail using IMAP or
POP, and Pine is an obvious candidate for the User Agent. 

However, there are users who will be wanting to access their mail from a
number of different places - e.g. from a University Department and from
home, and possibly from out of town from time to time. This of course will
all work fine, EXCEPT for the fact that Pine keeps its address book on the
client where you are running Pine.

Wouldn't it be nice if Pine were to keep the addressbook on the server
machine? Then it would always be available.

First thought says: "But that means modifying the IMAP protocol", but then
I thought "No, you could keep the address book in a folder file."  Is this
a silly idea? When Pine contacts a server to open {xxxx}INBOX it could
look for {xxxx}ADDRESSBOOK and read its contents over, strip off the fake
"message" header, and there you are. 

I haven't developed this idea much, because those that know more than I do
may be about to tell me why it can't be done. 

P.S. There's the .pinerc file as well...

Thank you for your suggestion of storing the addressbook as a folder on the
server machine.  That is an excellent idea; in fact, it is one of the ideas we
are considering.

Is there a way to select a suborder by which he main index is sorted by. I
would like to sort first by the from field but then by the date field in
ascending order. Can this be implemented?

I believe that only one sort field is permitted.  However, I'd certainly support
the provision of more than one sort field.  When I have a lot of mail to read I
like to sort my mail on Subject (primary) and Date (secondary).  That way mail on
the same subject is grouped together in chronological ordering.  I reckon it
saves me vast amounts of time because I can more quickly skip text which
occurred in a  previous item.

I think this is a pretty good idea, probably even just for the regular 
sort by subject.  It's almost net news style threading.  All you have to 
do further is display only one line in the index for each subject. 

I think the best thing to do group the subjects together, and then sort 
the groups based on the most recent message in each group.  Opinions?

I have an MSc student who will be starting her project in July. She wishes
to write software to convert between the different "addressbook" formats
used by the various mail user agents we have in the dept. The idea is that
someone should be able to use different MUAs on different machines without
having to manually update addressbook formats.

The coming question is obvious: is the format used in the pine addressbook
publicly available?

If she does produce anything of use (not always the case with MSc
students!!) I will quite happily make it generally available.

regards

Laurie Cuthbert

Yes, it's quite public and available.  It's documented in the Pine
Technical Notes that are distributed with Pine (There's lots of other
stuff in the Technical Notes too).  There's also a shell script to
convert from Berkeley .mailrc aliases to the Pine address book that's
distributed as part of Pine.

The addressbook format is very simple.  A simple nickname is of the form

	nickname <tab> lastname [, firstname] <tab> address

and a distribution list is of the form

	listname <tab> name of list <tab> "(" list-of-names ")"

where list-of-names is a comma separated list of addresses and/or nicknames.

Also, I have been working on the addressbook issue a bit and I would be
happy to collaborate with your student on this project.

We also have a program to convert between RICE mailer notebooks and the
Pine addressbook.  The author is Tom Remmers.  (remmers@u.washington.edu.)

I'm sure she would be very happy to collaborate - but it's probably best
to wait until she has starteed to do the actual work.

OUR PROBLEM

We want to copy to ourself each message that is sent out.  Is there anyway
in which we can configure pine to do this automatically? 

POSSIBLE SOLUTION?

Set the default-fcc variable (of ~/.pinerc) as follows:
   default-fcc=inbox
This seems to work (provided IMAP is not used), e.g.:
   inbox-path=/var/spool/mail/dcl0bjc
Although this seems to work, is this stretching the Pine system?
In particular, will the file-locking on the inbox cope with this?

Note, if IMAP is used, e.g.:
   inbox-path={vega}inbox
then the message is Fcc-ed to the file ~/{vega}inbox.  Is this a bug?
Most of our users use IMAP rather than NFS-mounting their inbox.
So we would prefer:
   default-fcc=inbox
to work with IMAP.   Will it require much work to get this working?

Just a small ugliness...

There is zero reason for pine to prompt new Pine users regarding renaming
sent-mail just because they have no "last-time-prune-questioned" date in
.pinerc. Adding a quick stat() call to check the size of the current sent-mail
folder allows skipping the prompt if the sent-mail folder is zero bytes in
length (as for new users or people who never send mail, anyway).

By the way, my "system address book" functionality is working fine now. My
latest pico  hack was to replace P_open() (and the call for the spell
checker) so that you can run things without a shell; we are using ispell -l
now. ispell is certainly much more powerful than spell, but in the interest
of leaving pico alone as much as possible, I used the -l option so it would
behave like normal spell.

Billy, the P_open() call in pico/osdep.c can be used wherever you need
popen(). Its arguments are like those to execv() (varargs), except the first
argument is a filename to be placed on the child's standard input (or "\0" if
you don't need that). There is also a P_close() there.

I wrote a very short and simple minded shell script for converting an
elm aliases.text file to a .addressbook. It is crude but works for me
and did what I wanted.

If anyone would like a copy then email me.

Something strange seems to be happening to the "From:" field in the

Subject: remote folder management
Date: Wed, 26 May 93 13:53:27 -0400

I seem to recall some comment (perhaps in reference to PC-Pine) that
remote folder management is going to be enhanced in future versions of
Pine and PC-Pine.  Here at umich, we're planning to run an IMAP service
for the campus, and have run into some problems with Pine/Mailstrom
incompatibility in remote folder management.  Specifically, while it's
easy to specify that the inbox is a remote IMAP mailbox, we'd like to
be able to, in Pine, specify that all folder management take place on
a remote IMAP server.  This is to prevent users here from creating
folders with Pine, then wondering why they can't access them from
Mailstrom (since the IMAP server and the user's UNIX machines won't be
sharing filesystems).

So, I guess my question is: can someone fill me in on what remote
folder management in Pine is going to look like in future releases?

Gordon,
In a nushell: for both Unix Pine and PC-Pine there will be a notion of
"folder-collections" (and also "news-collections") that are defined in the
.pinerc file.  You can think of those as directories, (though they could
conceivably be a subset of a directory or some set unrelated to a
directory). 

Any folder collection may be local or remote.  Here's an excerpt from 
my .pinerc:

news-collections=News *{news.u/nntp}[*],
        MailNews *{news.u/nntp}[*mail*]

folder-collections=PRIMARY {shivafs.cac.washington.edu}./[*],
        PINE {shivafs.cac.washington.edu}PINE/[*],
        MailDir {shivafs.cac.washington.edu}mail/[*],
        OldNews {shivafs.cac.washington.edu}News/[*],
        Mead {mead.u.washington.edu}mail/[*],
        Phantom {phantom.cac.washington.edu}./[*],
	LAPTOP mail\[*]

In this case, all of the collections except the last one are remote.
Note that the path syntax is whatever is right for the OS storing
the collection, so watch the direction of your slashes when mixing DOS 
and Unix collections.  Many people will have a single collection on
a timesharing host.  Those who use a timesharing host for dialin and
PC-Pine on their desk will typically have at least two.  I find the
Folder Collections paradigm useful for organizing things, so I tend to
have many.

Note also that the MailNews collection is defined to be the subset of 
available folders (newsgroups) that have the string "mail" in their name.

It will also be possible for the default-fcc to be a remote folder.

In order to be able to *append* to an existing remote folder (i.e. Save),
or *create* a new remote folder, you will need a new version of IMAPd,
to be released *soon* with PC-Pine.  Without the extended IMAPd you can 
access remote folders, but not append to or create them.

Regarding PC-Pine and "soon"... I know many of you are patiently waiting 
for it.  Since I have a perfect record of being wrong about every date 
I've offered so far, I'll refrain.  There is a memory leak yet to be tracked 
down and a couple of command name inconsistencies yet to be fixed, but
there is steady progress and the goal grows ever closer.  (Each week we 
halve the distance to the goal... :)

We are doing fundamentally the same thing with ECSMail, except 
that we call the "folder collections" "Message Services".    The idea
is to connect to a "service" that will provide access to different message
collections called "folders".    We played with the idea of calling them
Message Stores, but figured that Joe Average Person wouldn't 
get the terminology.   Besides, I'd hate to elevate Mark's blood
pressure over something like X.400 terminology :-)   

Message Services have a number of key attributes:

 1.  Type of service:  "Mail" or "Bulletin Board".
 2.  Service host.
 3.  Authentication information.   Basically the userid and password 
  which is authorized to connect to the message service.

Each Message Service is assigned a logical name (like Terry has
done with Pine I see), and is always referred to by that name.

Within a Message Service a user is allowed to subscribe to a number 
of folders.    For bulletin board services (News), folders correspond to 
individual boards, sigs or newsgroups.    Note that the underlying 
bboard type is completely transparent to the user.     It is up to the 
*server* to decide what type of services it will offer and how they
are accessed on the server host.   

Because ECSMail is a GUI based interface, we are able to do some
interesting things with association of names to services and opening
and closing services.    I think that it will be very user friendly and
easy to understand.

Once the IMSP reference implementation becomes available, we'll
be able to add more direct Message Service management support 
to the interface.    I am quite looking forward to that.

I am interested as to why you maintained "path syntax" at all in
your configuration.     Something that I have thought for some time
is that the client should really have no say at all as to where on 
the server messages are stored or accessed from.    The server
should decide all of that based on the Message Service attributes
that I defined above.    We have tried to be careful to hide
that server OS information from the user and require only the 
Message Service "attributes".    It works fine so far as all the user
folders have to be in a standard place defined by the server.

It does make sense to have a server configuration file that specifies
what folders and message services are provided by that server
host.    Specifically, Joel King and I have thought for some time that
it would be nice if the imapd server could be runtime configured to
identify where user folder, inboxes and News configuration sat.    That
would allow a mail adminstrator to reorganize folder and mailbox
directories and manage storage better.      

Once the Kerberized version of imapd is available, I would like
to do away with the concept of having a UNIX account define
a user's authentication and mail storage.    If authentication is
handled by the Kerberos (or some other) authentication service,
then the physical location of the inbox and user folders is up to
the imapd server.    Of course any MTA delivering to an inbox
would also have to be able to locate the inbox for delivery.    I 
have already begun modifications to the Z-mailer MTA to be 
able to deliver to a user mailbox based on information held
in an authentication service (Kerberos).    

The one interesting question that can be raised is: If I can't 
specify the path for my folders, then how can I organize my mail.  
Easy - support hierarchical folder models.    ECSMail will do so in 
version 3.00 (end of Sept).    It appears that most of the functionality
we need is already in the c-client, we just need to make some
modifications to the MH driver and build a nice GUI graphical 
representation on the front.    It should provide a very nice 
abstraction for the user that is also very useable and powerful.

The alpha ECSMail v2.00 uses imapd 2.4 which supports News and 
remote folder management functions very nicely.    It works quite well,
and we can happily drag and drop between local and remote folders.    
This is really a fine piece of work Mark!

I hope I didn't ramble on too much.    I think that this is important
because it really emphasizes the power of the remote mail access
protocol model over file based solutions.    It is definitely the 
right solution for large organizations or organizations with highly
mobile individuals.        

Cheers.

I am having problems getting pine to use NIS entries on an SGI platform.
Any local user ids that can't be found end of with a TO: entry of

To:  e <user@sandcastle.cosc.brocku.ca>

I noticed that the make does include the sun lib which is suppose to then
use the NIS calles for getpw... but it does not look like it is working.
The NIS password file is in a separate file from /etc/passwd.

Anyone else have similar problems or suggestions.
Thanks

Hello All,

  I've been meaning to write about Pine under SGI for quite some time now.
Our imap server runs on a DecStation. Transparent access via the rimap
mechanism works fine from Sun machines and IBM RS6K machines. 
Pine under SGI, although compiled with -lsun for NIS support, always asks
for a username/password combination. 

  Now for what Jamie has seen:

> I am having problems getting pine to use NIS entries on an SGI platform.
> Any local user ids that can't be found end of with a TO: entry of

I've tested Composer on Sun, IBM and SGI - all produce a To: line like:
To      : eran@bgumail.bgu.ac.il

Only the imap server machine, while running Pine, produces:
To      : Eran Lachs <eran@bgumail.bgu.ac.il>

Any pointers to the above two points much appreciated.
BTW - all mentined Pines are 3.05 (IBM's are 3.0.5a).

Yes!  I had exactly this problem too!

I traced the problem to some apprarent incompatibility between the compatibility
routines declared in the c-client/os_sgi.c & .h files and the ones provided by
the real operating system.

For some strange reason the c-client for SGI comes shipped with its own
functions for these functions: strtok; strchr; strrchr; strstr; strpbrk;
strerror; memcpy; memmove; memset; strtol.  These are all available as standard
IRIX provided routines (an din fact keeping the extra c-client routines in leads
to some warning mesages later from ld about multiply defined routines).

I "cured" the problem simply by removing *all* the above routines from the
c-clinet/os_sgi.[ch] files, did a "make clean" to remove *all* the .o and .a
files, and doing a total rebuild.

This problem was in Pine 3.05 too (where I originally encountered and traced
it); when Pine 3.07 came along I just reapplied my context diffs to elimiate the
bogus routines again.

Gosh!  Isn't it amazing when you open your mouth!

I've had a lot of queries from people asking about "my" VMS port of Pine.  I
think I'd better clear up some misapprehensions before I get inundated!

*  I took the standard Pine 3.07 distribution kit and unpacked it on VMS.

*  We are using DEC's UCX (now called TCP/IP Services for VMS?) software as a
transport mechanism, and I wanted to see if I could get the Pine *client* (NB.
*Not* the impad daemon) working under VMS, so VMS users could query the imapd
running on our UNIX boxes.

*  After about an afternoon of minor fiddling with the c-client sources they all
compiled happily under VAXC and linked with the UCX libraries.  The "mtest" test
program worked: you could connect to the UNIX IMAP service and login, list your
messages, etc..

*  Then came a LOT of fiddling with the Pico and Pine stuff.  Unfortunately
Pico/Pine are very much into using UNIX's curses or terminfo databases, and lots
of ioctl calls that VAXC does not provide or fully implement :-(

*  I decided I couldn't progress any further.  After keeping the c-client
sources around for ages I eventually had to delete them ... one week before all
this started (sigh!).

*  The c-client stuff really is trivial to get up and working.  The one gotcha
is that you should *resist* the temptation to bundle all the object files into
an object library (a ".olb" file, the equivalent of the ".a" libraries on UNIX)
as this causes the linker to create an incorrect executable (the problem lies in
the linking in of the mail drivers to the main program).  Instead keep all the
object files separate and link them explicitly.

*  Some brave sole might be able to fake some terminfo or curses "compatibility"
routines which provide sufficient know-how to drive, say, a VT100 type terminal
(this should satisfy virtually everyone!).  I can't.  This would deal with the
output side of things.

*  This leaves the input side, where someone would need to figure out about
single key I/O and things.  Given that there already exist similar program (such
as the Gopher 1.12 program which compiles happily under VAX/VMS with VAXC and
UCX) this may not be too much of a problem for someone withthe time and
expertise.  I'm afraid I certainly don't have at least the former :-(

So to summarise....

There is and will be no progress on a VMS Pine client from me, I'm afraid.

If someone else manages to get such a beastie up and running (preferably Pine
3.07) I would be *VERY* interested, as it would grealy help us in our gentle
migration from VMS to UNIX over the next couple of years.  *PLEASE* let me
know!

I hope this clears everything up a bit (I never actually said in my original
message that I was still actively working on a port, but hope springs eternal in
people's hearts, I suppose! :-)

                                                        Mike B-)

Mike -

     Thank you for informing me about the problem with the SGI port.  I have
fixed it in the c-client sources, and eventually the change will percolate
into the Pine distribution.  I have no access to any SGI systems, so I am
completely dependent upon those who do for information.  The SGI port was
supplied by a user, modified from one of the other ports (probably the BSD
port).

     I would like to plead with everyone that if you discover this sort of
incompatibility, don't just fix it at your site and let the matter be.  Tell
us about it!  We are interested, and will do our utmost to get fixes in later
releases.  Most of the Pine development at UW is done under Ultrix or NeXT,
since those are the machines used by the Pine team.  We have access to a few
other machines (most notably, we support Pine/imapd on the computer center's
PTX machine), but otherwise we are dependent upon you for ports for other
platforms as well as keeping these ports from succumbing to software rot.

Jamie,

further to my note of last night,  i just built 3.07 "out of the box"
and the NIS password routines work okay.  this is on machines running
IRIX 4.0.1 and 4.0.5F.  the fact that the NIS passwd file is not
/etc/passwd is a red herring, because NIS passwd lookups go to the NIS
server, not to a file on the local machine.

that's it.  no warnings about the string functions at all.  i agree
though that there's no need for definitione of all the string
functions in c-client/os_sgi.c, when they are already in the standard
IRIX libraries.  as for the original NIS problem, i don't see off-hand
why these multiple definitions, etc. would cause the problem of NIS
passwd lookups failing from pine.

i will volunteer to clean up the SGI stuff, unless someone else wants
to:-).  it may take me some time before i can get to this though.
