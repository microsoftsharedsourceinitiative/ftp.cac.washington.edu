Hi,

my boss has just had a crash sending some mail with pine 3.07 on a
Sparcstation running SunOS 4.1.1, IDA sendmail, using DNS to resolve
addresses.  The tail of the .pine-debug file is below.

His main gripe was that after the crash he couldn't resurrect the message,
and I had a look around under his home and mail directories and in /tmp
and couldn't find any temporary files which looked like his mail.  The
mail hadn't been appended to the sent-mail folder.

I am wondering how easy it would be to make Pine 'safer' in the event of a
crash, or where I should look for his message's corpse?

This is our first 'major' problem in more than a year of Pine use.

Mike

Not sure if this is the right place to send this query, but here goes:

We are currently migrating from a home-grown mail system on Primes on
to a standard unix mail environment, and Pine certainly looks to be the
ideal replacement.

Part of the exercise involves proving that the new system can do everything the old one could do, and this has meant a few minor patches to the code (3.07).
We now have to do some more tinkering, and I have seen a reference to version
4 beta in other correspondence.  Many of the enhancements we are looking for may well be in the new version - so is there such a version available and where 
can I get it from?

In particular, we are interested in integrating a news reading service, and
 perhaps replacing our current concept of 'notice boards' with news groups.

One use of our current notice board is as a mini bbs, to place software and
documents for downloading to a pc - any ideas on how to do this? the biggest
problem seems to be keeping track of what each user has read from a shared
folder, which I guess is what news groups would handle well.

The other feature we are looking for is some sort of directory service, to
enquire what a persons mail address is, or perhaps what are the valid
addresses in a functional work group.  Is anything being deveoped along these
lines?

By the way, this is not coming to you from within our version of Pine, because
we have only indirect access to the internet at the moment, and I have to go
through another site which only has standard mail.

Thanks,
Michael Fox

Glad to hear it!

We are currently working on 3.83, which will be the first real release of
PC-Pine (coming R.S.N.).  A matching Unix Pine 3.83 will appear soon after
that.  You can think of 3.83 as a pre-release of 4.0, but there will be
more stuff added and fixed by the time 4.0 hits the street.  (Late
summer/early Fall???)

News support will improve with each release.  The next version will allow
specification of one or more news collections, and display subscribed
newsgroups (according to your .newsrc) using the Folders screen.  Next
will come posting, subscription management, etc.

Yes, a newsgroup is the easiest way of handling that right now if you 
want to keep track of which msgs each person has seen.  (Otherwise you
can arrange access to a read-only folder, where all msgs in the folder
will continually reappear.)

We've talked about defining the mailbox equivalent of a .newsrc for 
shared mailboxes, but haven't done anything about it yet.

Both of these are already on the list, but I can't say exactly when they 
will become available.

There is some support for newsreading in 3.07, it will be expanded in 4, 
along with remote folder management.

The new version will include PC-Pine (MS-DOS).  It should not be too hard 
to integrate your notice board functionality...

Right now, the only method is to use addressbooks.  A more complete 
directory service is on the to-do list though...

We have found a small interoperability problem between ECSMail and
Pine that we believe to be a bug in Pine.  It appears that Pine is
sensitive to character case in the Type and Subtype fields of a
multipart attachment. 

For example, a text file attachment with the type/subtype
combination of "TEXT/plain" will correctly display, but a
the type/subtype combinations of "TEXT/PLAIN" and "TEXT/Plain"
will not.   Editing these fields by hand in a message file 
will allow you to recreate this error in a consistent way.

By our understanding of the MIME spec, case independent 
comparisons should be made.   We are going to change ECSMail
to canonicalize outgoing Type/subtype pairs to Capitalized
words eg. Text/Plain.   

Cheers.

signoff. I realise that you can't have a post-mortem for every bug
reported, but crashing (as opposed to grumbling) because of message

for this user (so serious she has to use UCBmail which is happy with the
same messages). Any thoughts? Has anyone else had a similar problem?

Hi Mike -

     This sounds like a bug that was already fixed, but without sample data
that exercises the bug there is no way to know for sure.  I'm sorry that you
are having problems.  As soon as we know what's wrong, we'll be able to advise
you on how to fix it.

     We're presently working on a major new release (not a maintenance release
as 3.07 was), and we do want to make sure that all known bugs are fixed in it.
We tried to do that for 3.07, but perhaps we missed one.

This happens whenever I have to page back up past the current screen (i.e.
greater than 24 lines).

It then get expanded and I would only see the last few names. When I try
and move back up to the top of the list or even to find the previous name
like R@ucs.indiana.edu I get the exit from pine message. 




Excuse the made up names in the examples...

Mike, 
To add to what Mark said, you might want to try 3.07, as it looks like 
you are still using 3.05, and there were definitely some fixes for this 
class of problem in 3.07.

Is there going to be a release of Pine for Solaris 2.x ,
in particular Solaris 2.2 ? If so what is the timescale ?

Thank you in anticipation of replies.

After being moaned and griped at long enough, I have finally produced a
set of patches to port the lastest released version of pine to a System 5
Release 4.0 platform.  The patches have been produced and tested on
systems from two different software suppliers, and two different hardware
platforms (Sparc and Intel iAPX386/486)

The port has shown up the following problems:
	there is a generic bug is the smtpd in SVR4.  A RSET down the line
will cause the daemon to go away.   The RSETs sent within the imap code
have been commented out in this port;
	there is a bug/feature in the SVR4 mailer, such that local
messages are not provided with a From: or Date: rfc format line.  This
prevents pine from displaying this information correctly on the index screen;
	BUG!! there is a bug in the debugging code in the screen handling
code.  There is a loop that is supposed to cycle through an array,
printing the appropriate debugging code in the pine debug files.  The
length of the array is hard coded.  If the array is not this length, the
system tends to dump core.  This has been FIXED to cycle through the array
until the element is NULL.

This set of patches, including the new os .h and .c files, comes to about
40k compressed.  If the Pine maintainers want this code ftp'ed up to cac,
I am more than willing to do this, just tell me where.

This has not been validated on SVR4.2, as our system is still not right yet.

Good luck

Ross

We are also interested in this.  As reported to pine-info earlier, we have
used a SunOS 4.1.x binary of Pine 3.07 on a SunOS 5.2 system, and that
seems to work OK.

Pine folk,

Here's the scenario: the root user just sent out a mailing to a large
number of users (about 120) which was a mailing list entry in the
addressbook.  When I got the message, (I'm just above the halfway mark),
the subject line was inserted into the middle of the usernames??
Apparently everyone after this line didn't receive the mail.  She (the
root user) broke the list up and sent it again without incident.  Has anybody
experienced this before, is this a Pine problem or a sendmail problem?   The
mail was sent from a Sparcstation running SunOS 4.1.2, using Pine 3.05

Thanks in advance.

Peter - I have had similar problems in the past (sendmail on Sequent
Symmetry DYNIX/ptx 1.4), but my problems were not related to any mailer in
particular. The problem in *my* situation is sendmail: here's a
description ...

When mailing several users using the following shell script fragment: 

while read user_to_mail
do
mailx $user_to_mail < message_to_mail
done < mailing_list

Sendmail is literally bombarded causing it to get very confused and
scramble messages in a similar manner to your experience.

My workaround is to get the script to pause for five seconds between
mailings when several recipients are involved:

while read user_to_mail
do
mailx $user_to_mail < message_to_mail
sleep 5
done < mailing_list

And background the script because it takes awhile.

Maybe it's worthwhile trying these tests on your system? At least you will
be able to pinpoint which part of the mailing procedure is not working as
you expect: sendmail or Pine. 

Finally, I use an adaptation of the above shell script when mailing
several users to avoid the recipients having to plod through umpteen pages
of mailnames (which upsets some) before they get to the message. 

Cheers,
Dave

Anyone configured pine3.05 for the OSF1 Alpha platform? Any chance I could
get the respective configuration files? Thx in advance.

Subject: Delete key change wanted

We are recommending pine to our Unix users because of its ease of use.
We have now got rid of an IBM 3083 and our last remaining Prime
will join it in the great Computer Room in the sky in two weeks so we
have an influx of new users with enough new stuff to cope with.

All but a few users will be using PC style keyboards and we would like
to change the way the delete key works to accomodate
their expectations.  We would like delete (0x7f) to perform forwdel
rather than the standard backdel -- I have changed the tables in
pico/ebind.h but this appears to only affect the actions in the
message area while the standard action takes place in the header area.

Can somebody give a pointer to what is happening?  I've searched but I
can't see anywhere where keys are handled without reference to either
keytab or pkeytab in pico/ebind.c

Re: the PC keyboard support:

My users care coming in via VT100 and 220 emulation from PCs.  I do not
want to have everybody remap their keys in their comm programs.  Instead, I
want to set up their login/pine/pico to accept certain PC keys such as: 
allow the"Delete" key to work as a "Delete the character I'm on" key;
allow the "End" key to jump to the end of the line;
allow the "Home" key to go to the beginning of the line;
allow "Page Up/Down" to work as expected;
allow "Ctrl-Arrow-Left/Right" to jump a word at a time in the appropriate
direction;
allow "Ctrl-Arrow-Up/Down" to jump back a paragraph or up a paragraph. 

Re: the RICHER HEADER:
Is there any way I can include the Return-Receipt-To: in the header when
my users hit ^R???


Thanks,

Hello,

At present there's no way to remap keys in Pine/Pico short of modifying the
source code. Worse than that, as far as I know, most comm program handle most
of the keys you mentioned in a different way if at all. The comm program has
to send out some escape sequence for those keys since those keys don't have
an ASCII representation.  As far as I know there's not standard or even any
common practice for doing this.  If everyone of your clients is using the
same comm program and does send some escape sequence for these keys, then you
could hack the source and solve this problem.  Please pardon me if I've
misunderstood you and stated the obvious.

A while back, as I recall, there was a question about why Pine appended an 
empty line to the end of a message.  Perhaps the attached message that
appeared on the sun-managers list might be an answer to why it is a good
idea.

In my original posting, I had asked why sendmail on a particular machine
was timing out. Thanks for all the replies and the helpful suggestions.
all the answers said the said the same thing -- make sure that
all the lines in the ".sig" files end with a newline. This seems to have
worked. Thanks to the following :

 Steve Harris - Eaton Corp
 Christian Lawrence
 Richard Threadgill
 Brett Lymn

My apologies if I have missed any

        Sounds like a sendmail bug to me.

        After all the heat I took a couple of weeks ago for trying to see
Pine coded  *around*  bugs in other software,  ...       ;-)

        By golly,  you're right again,  Dan.

        So Pine has to cover for user (or editor) brokenness,
not sendmail brokenness.   Fair enough.

*But*, Pine can easily do:

	if input ends in a newline/line terminator then
		do nothing
	else
		add terminator
	fi

Thus guarding itself against bad input and ensuring that users who have
ensured proper message termination aren't annoyed.  I have just had to write a
mail script which was signbificantly complicated by Pine's tendency to add
extra lines.

End of insertion from "A. Hilborne"

I'd also support this request. Some programs which automatically answer
email requests can get confused by extra "lines". Of course this shouldn't
happen but this is the real world!

Dear Pine,

One of my users sent the following:

How do I go about the task of not receiving E-MAIL from a selected source?
On some systems this is possible. Can it be done on PINE? 
Thanx...

	I simply use the "filter" program supplied with elm for this purpose
and then use pine as my UA.

Why does pine remove (unlink) the address book before writing back the new
entries?  Can't it just overwrite the existing file?  The reason I ask and
as mentioned in the doc, the remove destroys any special protection and
symbolic link.  I like to use the latter to distribute the address books for
some users across various workstations.

I think I've found the solution.  I simply added/modifed the following
lines marked with a ++ in pine.c


    /* Must do this here, so we can get the .pinerc file and debug file */
++  if(getenv("PINEHOME") != NULL) { 
++      pine_state->home_dir = cpystr(getenv("PINEHOME"));
++  } else if(getenv("HOME") != NULL) { 
        pine_state->home_dir = cpystr(getenv("HOME"));
    } else if(get_system_homedir() != NULL) {
        pine_state->home_dir = cpystr(get_system_homedir());
    } else {
        pine_state->home_dir = cpystr("");
    }

and setenv PINEHOME in the user's login file (e.g., setenv PINEHOME
/mountpoint/$USER).  Is this a bad thing?  That way everything (almost -
not including the pine.info and pine.conf) is in the one place.  Before,
I was linking each mail subdirectory to the main server but now I don't
need to do this.  Yes, I know the possible problems associated with NFS
sharing the files but I've minimised the risk by using appropriate
options with the mount command.  Enabling file locking is next on my "to
do" list but I haven't seen any problems yet.

Hello Jack,

The reason Pine writes the address book to a temp file, removes the
original and renames the new one is to be sure the writing of the new
address book is complete before destroying the old one. 

I think you're scheme will work OK.  The main place to have locking is on
the inbox where there's contention all the time (new mail arriving). Some
of the Pine locking won't work across NFS (detecting another Pine has it
open), but the most basic locking (mail file consistency) will work unless
conditions are extreme. For example if you network is dropping NFS packets
the basic locking can fail.

Aloha from Hawaii,
 I am not sure if this is a local problem, or a pine problem, but
periodically (alot) users call in and complain that when they start pine,
it hangs for a couple (3-5) minutes before they are allowed to select anything
on the main menu. Sometimes the main menu comes up, sometimes it hangs
even before the menu comes up. I have noticed that it usually happens when
they first start pine in the morning. But once it 'unhangs' pine runs
smoothly. During these 'hangs' our other applications/sessions that are on
our system are fine.

We are running IBM RS6000 AIX version 3.2  Pine version 3.05a

Any help would be appreciated.

							Edward Yagi

ps. Can anybody point me to a spell checker for our setup?

I suggest first upgrading to 3.07.  3.07 runs notable quicker on our HP's
and Sequent's than 3.05 did.

Hope it helps...

I'm trying to get PINE up and running under SCO UNIX 3.2.4.1

So far, I've managed to get the Pine menu/message reading part working.
However when I try to go into sending a message (using the default PICO
composer), I get a screen full of garbage. It looks like this:

$<2>OOPS$<2>^$<2>$<2>G$<2> Get Help$<2> ...and so on for 15 or 20 lines.
There are lots of OOPS in this mess. 

This comes up whenever the editor is entered.

It looks as though PICO is starting up ok (you can see some of the PICO
messages in all this junk), but for some reason the screen is not being
set to the right mode...?

Does this sound familiar to anyone?

Oh yes, this is PINE verion 3.07.

I have got the standalone version of PICO working fine, so it doesn't seem
to be a problem inherent to PICO itself.

I also tried putting a different editor in the editor variable of .pinerc,
however this seems to be ignored...?

All comments and suggestions gratefully received!

Regards, Ben

Is there any type of Post Office Protocol available for use with PINE?

What about an off-line reader?

I would like to be able to dial into a server running PINE, quickly
download my new mail, then hangup, read & reply off-line, and upload
replies the next time I log in to the server.

If PINE can't do this, does anyone have sugestions?

Greg,
Pine uses the Interactive Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) rather than POP.
IMAP is a functional superset of POP, and offers quite a few advantages.
(For a detailed comparison, see the file "imap.vs.pop" in the /mail
directory of ftp.cac.washington.edu)
 
> What about an off-line reader?

This is a high priority for PC-Pine.  Three things are required: a way to
tell Pine to ignore the fact that the network isn't there, a convenient
way to save all or save new messages from the inbox, and a way to queue
(and later send) outgoing msgs. These won't make it into the upcoming
general release of PC-Pine, but I hope we'll have them done by end of
summer.

Close.  Using PC-Pine you would connect to an IMAP server (via SLIP or PPP
for now; maybe via async later) and download msgs of interest for offline
processing. 
 
> If PINE can't do this, does anyone have sugestions? 

Most POP clients support this paradigm, although the mail is typically 
deleted from the server after you've downloaded it, which is not always 
what you want, and POP is an all-or-nothing protocol; there is no 
mechanism for selective download.

The best disconnected operation support is currently provided by PC-MAIL,
which uses the DMSP protocol.  It provides for resynchronization of the
local message cache with the state of the server.  As part of the IETF
standardization work on IMAP, this type of functionality will be added to
IMAP. 

Hope this helps...

Does anyone have any idea when the next PINE version will be coming out?
Also, will it use the new IMAP-3.0 version of the c-client (and thus
support MMDF)?

Steve,
We've been unable to reproduce the case sensitivity to MIME types that 
you observed; however, we did just find a bug wherein Pine refused to
display a text attachment if the charset spec was missing.  This will be 
fixed in the upcoming release.

If you could send as an attachment a msg that demonstrates the
case-sensitivity bug we can investigate further.  (There must be some
combination of message characteristics that trigger the bug for you but
not us.)

-teg

p.s. What's the latest estimate for the next ECS release?

Subject: Must all messages be coded?

When I send messages with Pine, funny codes crop up in the
messages when they arrive to their recipients.

For example, all "=" are replaced by "=3D" and lines
with spaces before the end-of-line (which my text editor
produces very often) get the spaces converted to "=20".
People complain to me of this, they ask me why I have
such funny codes in my messages.

I guess that the reason for this is that Pine encodes
them in a MIME encoding. I am not against MIME, but is
it necessary to use MIME encodings of all messages.
Could not ordinary, plain ascii text messages be
transferred in a body part format which does not
require such encodings?

I think you have misunderstood slightly here.

These codes only show up if you use characters outside the normal 7 bit
ASCII (or ISO 646, or IA5, or whatever...) character set. And pine is
doing precisely what it should, encoding these according to MIME.

As long as you stay with 7 bit ASCII, your characters will not converted
to "funny codes" as you call them.

Content-Type: TEXT/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I had a user (one!) complain of this same problem.

I noticed that an extra line was added to the heading saying something about
encoding the message (not MIME though).

I looked at the source code and found that Pine looks at the body of the message
and applies a few tests to the text in it:

*  If all the characters are in the ASCII range 0..127 AND all the lines are <=
500 characters in length, simply send the message as plain text;

otherwise,

*  If fewer than 10% of the characters are in the ASCII range 128..255 (top bit
set -- often multinational characters) AND all the lines are <= 500 characters
in length, encode ALL non-printing characters (top bit sets AND things like Tab)
as =xx, where xx is its ASCII code expressed in hexadecimal;

otherwise,

*  treat the text as a binary file and encode all of it.

Thus if you include even one top-bit-set character ALL non printing characters
get encoded into your funny "=xx" triplets.  If the message recipient uses Pine
to view the message these get automagically converted back to their originals.
However if another mailer is used this doesn't happen and the encoding is shown
instead.

It's worth remembering that mail is intended for "plain text", i.e., characters
which don't have top-bit set (otherwise we wouldn't need ftp as well as mail!)

I'm not saying this IS your particular problem, but it was ours, which sounds at
first glance (mixing metaphors madly!) very similar.

Subject: saving messages in pine


I have no idea if this has been brought up already. When I try to save a
piece of mail, pine asks me what I want to name the folder but defaults to
the sender's address. Here's my gripe: if the sender's address is a bang
path, destroyer!cs.ubc.ca!unixg.ubc.ca!swiss.ucs.ubc.ca!ferch@uunet.uu.net,
for example, I cannot type the folder I want the mail to be saved in, because
the long address has pushed the cursor too far to the right, and the terminal
beeps instead of wrapping. I don't know if this is a problem with my terminal
(Macintosh NCSA Telnet 2.5 with Wrap Mode switched on), my host (NeXTstation
running NeXTStep 2.0), my version of pine (3.07), or just "the way things
work." If it can either be fixed so that I can type a name or if it auto-
magically shortens the name with the same end-result, I would appreciate it.

As it is, I think it's pine's fault, and my only work-around is quitting pine,
opening up mail, saving the mail there, and going back to pine.

If I am way off base, please let me know.

thanx,
shy

Jacob, this is because you use 8-bit characters in your mail. Pine sees
this and encodes the message using "quoted printable". 

There is no support for the MIME-encoding "8bit" which can be used if you
know for sure that the path between you and the recipient is safe for
8-bit characters. That's a bug or a feature depending how you see it.
Forcing MIME-encoding will hopefully make more people convert to
MIME-readers and thus raise the demand for MIME-compliant software.
It would be nice if this was selectable when sending or composing though.

All 8-bit chars are coded as =<hex>, and thus a plain "=" needs to be
converted as well.

Long lines (>70?) chars are wrapped and a "=" placed at the end, this is
because it wants to guard the mail from evil gateways (some are known to
auto-wrap).  

What I don't understand is why this feature is mixed into the 8bit
encoding at all. This makes all mails in English prone to be mangled by
naughty gateways!

It is necessary to encode all 8-bit characters, as gateways are known to
(and according to specs must) strip the 8th bit. Some work is being done
on SMTP to enhance the protocol with the capability to determine if the
mail can be sent in 8-bit safe mode. Then the encoding/decoding would be
done by the MTAs instead of by the user. But that is of limited use until
everyone uses it....

They are already, as there are no 8-bit characters in ASCII.
But not plain ISO-8859 messages, they must be encoded.

(BTW, I just noticed a bug in Pico! I went into Help, and afterwards the
title on line 1 still reads "Help on the Pine Composer, page 1 of 13".
This is Pine 3.07)
