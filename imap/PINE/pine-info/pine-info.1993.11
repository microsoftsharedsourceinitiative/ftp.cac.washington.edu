I have such a tool.  It is a Bourne shell script which relies heavily on 
awk (well, nawk actually).  Anybody who wishes a copy can drop me a line 
in e-mail.  I'd be happy to share.

I am in the process of re-coding the utility in C, with a grammar 
constructed using lex & yacc.  I'm a ways off on that, however (I'm a 
yacc novice).

Pine does not really "understand" the comments in the .pinerc.  When
updating an old .pinerc, the old comments are preserved as much as
possible to preserve any comments the user has inserted or modified. 
We plan to make Pine smarter about comments at some point in the
future...

Unless you have some other setting, like read-message-folder,

Subject:      Binaries for AIX 3.2
To: pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu

I  am running  AIX 3.2.3  and can  build pine/pico  just fine  using the
'build a32';  however, when  I run  pine almost anything  I do  causes a
IOTrap abend with core dump. It appears  that this is a problem with the
AIX 3.2.3  system which  according to  reports out  in NetLand  does not
occur with AIX 3.2.4.

I  ftp-ed  your  aix32  binaries  but  they  have  the  problem  of  not
recognizing my  'vt220' terminal. There is  a simple fix for  this and I
would like  to request a re-build  of the aix32 binaries  (pine/pico) to
solve  the problem.  The only  change  needed is  to the  'makefile.a32'
files and that is just an insertion  of "-lcurses" into the LIBES as the
first library.  It should look like:
    LIBES = -lcurses -ltermcap -lc
instead of:
    LIBES = -ltermcap -lc
when this is done it should link without problems *and* recognize all
the vtXXX's normally known to AIX.

If you  could rebuild those binaries  with the -lcurses I  would be very
grateful!

BTW:  All my  correspondence  to  the pine  lists  have  been from  this
account which is  an IBM VM/ESA System running RiceMail  (MUA) and LMail
(MTA) -- which does  not support MIME at this time.  I have no Pine/Pico
available at this time on any of my machines.... and I really need it
on my RS/6000 AIX 3.2.3 units.

I'd like to read news from the Pine mailreader.  How can I convince Pine 
to look in a non-conventional place for news?

Instead of /usr/spool/news, I keep my news in /usr/news/spool.  This is 
on the local system (no NNTP or IMAP needed).

Any help or hints are appreciated.

I have been using pine (albeit 3.85, as that's the last linux port that I 
have--awaiting 3.88) via imap.  It appears that if I close the remote 
mailbox and exit the host and rather invoke the remote host again via 
imap, that I am not prompted for a userid or password.

Is there some type of 'hidden authentication' still in effect that would 
not allow someone 'posing' as me to log in via imap and access my mailbox 
during this brief period.  It seems that if I exit the host and look at 
[INBOX] as a new folder and then go back to the remote host, all's well.

Possibly, I'm seeing that pine is still connected via imap and doesn't 
actually close the connection until a new folder is opened.

Ideas?

You can edit the c-client/os_???.h file for your system and change 
the definition of NEWSSPOOL, then rebuild.

Or, you can provide a symbolic link to /usr/spool/news.

A folder remains open until you exit pine or open another folder, the 
exception being the INBOX which remains open until you exit Pine.  Is 
this what you are seeing?

Users of our system would like to find out about other users on the 
system, for example when they cannot remember their e-mail ID. If they 
also use the underlying UNIX system, finger does it for them. If they 
only use PINE on a PC, they have to exit PINE, use finger, then go back 
in to send the mail. It would be nice to have a "finger" option available 
on PINE's menu.
This can only be classed as an "it would be nice" item for the wishlist.
Since MAISTROM does it on the MAC, I assume that all the necessary IMAP 
features are already present.

Subject: INBOX again: BSD-mail-mbox model not allowed?
Date: Tue, 02 Nov 1993 15:11:04 +0100
From: Peter Svanberg <psv@nada.kth.se>

I've tried to read all about INBOX in the documentation and in
old messages on this list. Conclusions:

1) It is impossible to get the BSD-mail behavior with BSD-
   format usage in PINE - i.e. that incoming, read and unread
   mail is handled in _one_ file, which is not in
   /usr/spool/mail. 

2) With Tenex-format usage - on the other hand - this behavior
   is the default: /usr/spool/mail contents is silently moved to
   the mail.TxT file.

Questions:

3) Is the silently-moving model considered bad for _all_ users?
   In what way?

4) If so, why is that model still used with Tenex? If not, why
   not allow it in BSD-format usage also?

At least, I think, the documentation should warn, tell and
explain about this big difference for users used to the
BSD-mail program. I have not found anything about it.

Finger is not a function of IMAP.  We are planning to add support for 
directory services, which might include some form of access to finger 
as well.

You can get this behavior by linking the mbox driver into Pine.  This 
is the Berkeley format (bezerk) driver with silent moving added.

Thanks - works fine!

BTW, I saw there has been some progress to the MH driver - any
change in the will-maybe-work-some-day plans I was told before?

The only ``hidden authentication'' in Pine/imapd is that if you can rsh 
to the remote host for free, you can imap to it for free.  In other 
words, the answer is NO.

This can happen.  The primary INBOX is always kept open, and secondary 
streams can be recycled to open new folders.

This is correct with unmodified Pine.

If you modify the .../pine/pine.c file to have a line of
	mail_link (&mboxdriver);
before the mail_link() call for bezerkdriver (you may also have to add 
mboxdriver in the list of driver externals elsewhere), then you will get 
that behavior.

mbox is like tenex, but it uses the /usr/spool/mail format.

This is correct.

Some people find it objectionable, which is why mboxdriver is normally 
turned off.

>    not allow it in BSD-format usage also?

This model is the only model meaningful for Tenex.  But, because some 
people find mail.txt to be a dangerous name, it was changed to mail.TxT.

I've just compiled 3.87 for linux.  We're up to speed now.  All that 
remains is to work on the the .pinerc file (beginning to resemble a 
sendmail.cf file to some degree with all the options available).

Thanks to you and David Miller.  The pieces to the puzzle are now easier to 
put together.

On behalf of new users yet to behold pine, and those of us who believe 
in making applications as intuitive as possible, the request below is 
for a new "feature" we are hoping you can fit in an upcoming release.

It is natural for users to attempt to select messages by entering the number.
The lack of such support is the most common complaint (amidst tons of 
praise) we hear from users.  

Please allow a user to enter the message number followed by the "Enter" as
a method to select and display a message, e.g., 38 <Enter>.

Thanks,

John E. Daum

Mark -- 

We've used the mbox driver in Pine here at CICNet for more than a year.  
Any chance that we can put it under a Makefile switch so we don't have to 
modify the code for every release we get?

Basically, some help is on the way.  c-client is now configurable at the 
makefile level for additional drivers.  I don't think that Pine 3.88 will 
use this new capability, but a future version of Pine will have it available.

I tried compiling pine under sv4, and all was well, until it tried to 
compile pine itself...  I got the following error: 

	cc -O pine.c -o pine 
"/usr/include/stdlib.h", line 66: identifier redeclared: system

*** Error code 1 (bu21)

make: fatal error.

The only changes made to makefile.sv4 were to comment out the entire 
DEBUG line and to uncomment the optimize line... These changes worked for 
the sunos version of pine, so I didn't think there'd be a problem with 
sv4 pine...

Seems the last time I installed pine on our convex I got the source
distribution from someone else. Wondered if anyone else has configured
pine 3.87 to build on a convex beast and if I could get it or the diffs? We 
have a 220 with version 10.0.3 of convexos (closer to bsd than it really
sounds :-)

Opps. The ASCII printing feature from NCSA Telnet v2.5x is particular to a
version modified by the University of Washington. According to a conversation
with Mark McNair at UW's Computing & Communications, this feature may possibly
appear in version 2.6 from NCSA. The UW version is available from anonymous ftp
at ftp.cac.washington.edu, /ncsa/mac. Presently I'm using the 2.5W-B3 beta
version without complications. My apologies.

NCSA Telnet v2.5x for the Macintosh DOES understand the ASCII printing escape
sequences. When you select Print ('Y') from pine, you should get the normal
print dialog box. If you Cancel the print dialog, you should get the option to
spool the job for later printing.

Hi, Dave.  I just built 3.87 on our Convex yesterday. :^)

Imapd does not build, due to a symbol, _philedriver, that neither the
loader nor I have been able to resolve.  I've reported this to
pine-bugs, BTW.  I setenv CCOPTIONS -ext and made a few small makefile
mods to turn debugger hooks off (but leaving -DDEBUG) and optimization
on, but otherwise "build cvx" works fine for me.

Hope this helps,

Some day I'll remember to use the -i option on grep :-)
when looking for proper names like convex in makefiles where
they appear as Convex.

You don't need any diff's. Just say

> ./build cvx

and it should work OK. The par has been made on a C3840 convexos 10.

There is bug in makefile.cvx.
You must add phile.o to c-client.a:

c-client.a: mail.o bezerk.o tenex2.o mbox.o mh.o imap2.o news.o nntpclient.o\
        phile.o dummy.o smtp.o nntp.o rfc822.o misc.o osdep.o sm_unix.o
        rm -f c-client.a
        ar rc c-client.a mail.o bezerk.o tenex2.o mbox.o mh.o imap2.o news.o \
        nntpclient.o phile.o dummy.o smtp.o nntp.o rfc822.o misc.o osdep.o \
        sm_unix.o

and also add following rule to makefile:

phile.o: mail.h phile.h misc.h osdep.h

I'm curious to know if there is way to convert .addressbook format into 
.mailrc format so that I can use command-line mailing to my pine 
aliases.  I know there is the brk2pine.sh program that comes with the 
source that will apparently work it the other way.

As I said, my goal is to set up a .mailrc alias file that I can use to do 
command line mailing.  I'd probably run the program to do the conversions 
at login or something jsut to keep up to date :-)

Thanks, y'all

A feature that we are missing for our PC-PINE users is the ability to 
tell them things about the current service. Examples might be:

Mail server crash - messages sent between a/b/c and d/e/f might be lost
Relay broken: messages to EARN are currently being rejected

Users who logon to a system will get such things.
 
Can this be put onto a wishlist, please? 
Obviously the text itself must be on the system which has the imap 
daemon, so it is not totally trivial to implement!

Any way, perhaps in future versions, to enter control characters like ^L 
and other key combinations used by pico in the text being edited, like 
emacs' ^Q escape? Had a user recently who wanted to add some ^Ls for form 
feed in a text.

Correct, makefile.cvx got missed when we added the philedriver to 
c-client.  Apologies for the omission.  This will be corrected in 
Pine 3.88.

Writing a pine2brk.sh should be quite possible, but we do not have 
one currently.  If you would like to write/contribute one, we would 
be happy to distribute it though...

As an interesting kludge, you might try setting

incoming-folders=Message-Of-The-Day	{imapserver}/etc/motd

This will give you an incoming folder, called Message-Of-The-Day and 
containing a single "message" which has /etc/motd as the body.  This 
does require an imapd with the phile driver installed.  Note that we 
do not have alot of practical experience with the phile driver yet...

Interesting thought, but not really a practical possibility.

We are in **production** which means that there are a large number of 
PINERC files out there on PCs, and we cannot go around changing them all, 
even in the cases where we can find them (such as those on our Novell net).
Of course, if we had a MotD, then we could put such a message on it :-) 

Still, we might experiment with that idea.

The real plan is for IMAPd to notice the existence of some file (not 
necessarily /etc/motd, but maybe) and then send an unsolicited reply to 
the client which would show up on Pine's message line.

This has the advantage that it does not require client configuration; it
has the disadvantage that the message must be small and may be fleeting... 
Ultimately we may want to have a combination of both strategies, where
there might even be a future version of Pine that adds something to
existing pinerc files to allow easy access to a "system" folder...  These
are just random thoughts while I'm between sessions at IETF; we have not
yet experimented with any of these mechanisms in real life.

Hi.  I remember hearing about a bug in pine that would leave crashed imap
sessions up, running and increasing the load....well, i was wondering if
anyone knows why this is happening?  I noticed on the machine i use most
often, that there are two that have been running for a while (the shorter has
been running for about 24 hours, the other, i don't know how long...)....

Sorry folks, the previous message was meant to be a direct post to the

Pine versions 3.85 through 3.87 have a bug that can cause runaway 
processes if a connection is lost when waiting at a prompt in the 
composer.  This bug will be fixed in Pine 3.88.

Hi,

somebody told me that in 'elm' you can mark several messages and then
apply a function (reply, forward, delete, etc.) to them...

I want to do that in pine too... is it possible?


PD: if this is a FAQ question, please flame me but tell me where can I
find it! :)

This is indeed an FAQ, but since we don't have an FAQ answer list 
written up I guess you'll have to flame us ;)

This capability is not yet available in Pine, but is high on the list 
of enhancements.  We are not yet far enough along to have any 
projection of when it will be available.

Pine does not currently understand FAX formats directly, but you can 
attach a FAX as an application/octet-stream, save it in a file upon 
reciept and view it with an external FAX viewer.

Or, possibly convert the fax image to a TIFF or PCX file and use
one of the image viewers commonly available.  But I think we're

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I've long wanted the ability to PGP sign a message in pine.  The 
following is sorta a solution, and isn't perfect, but it does perform the 
necesssary function.

- ----------------------------

1)  Extract the following to a file called 'picopgp' (or whatever you 
    wish to call it).

- ---> begin script
	#!/bin/sh

	pico -z -t $1
	pgp -s $1
	mv $1.asc $1
- ---> end script

2)  chmod it to be executable and put it into your path
3)  change your alternate editor to 'picopgp'

- -------

Then, if ever you want to sign a message, you can invoke your alternate 
editor command (^_) and it will sign it for you.

As I said, this isn't perfect, but it is functional.

If you have any questions, just ask.  I spent about 5 minutes on this, 
so there could be problems (more bugs than lines of code, that's my motto :-)

Have a nice day.

Sorry, here is a corrected version of the PGP script I just mailed.  I 
have my environment defined with the following options, which are not the 
default:
	Armor = on          # Use -a flag for ASCII armor whenever applicable
	TextMode = on       # Attempt to use -t option where applicable

Thus, here is a corrected script to allow the message to maintain text 
conformity.  Apologies.

I am the author of imapd.  You may send specific technical questions on
imapd to me.  Please read the documentation first, including the Pine
technical notes, since many frequently asked questions appear in this
document. 

In general, however, sending questions to a personal mailbox of a Pine
team member is a bad idea.  You may guess wrong as to who should field a
question (in which case we have to forward the message to the rest of the
team); the question may be of interest to someone else (in which case the
question will answered again); or the Pine team member in question may be
on vacation or otherwise off-line (in which case your response will be
delayed). 

So, in general, please continue to use pine@cac.washington.edu and/or 
pine-info@cac.washington.edu.

I have looked and hopefully well :)  I have imapd set up in /etc/services and
/etc/inetd.conf, I am trying to find an example of .imapdrc but can't.

I also couldn't find an example of pine.conf, but that doesn't seem to be 
a problem as pine made a .pinerc for me as soon as I brought it up.

Anyway to the point.  I have imapd running on eng.futurenet.com, I am
trying to run pine as a client on oak.futurenet.com and it appears imapd
may be ok on eng, but I still can't open my inbox from oak.  I am 
getting the following error when I try after it asks me for my login and
password on eng:

IMAP broken in reply

I do have a link between imapd and rimapd

I can send you my pine-debug if you need it as well.

thanks in advance

You should not need an ~/.imaprc or /etc/imapdrc file.  These files 
control only two aspects of behavior.  One aspect is obscure (and may be 
eliminated in the future); the other defaults to the behavior which 
should be correct 99% of the time.

There is a possibility that these files themselves may become extinct.

Most likely, it is ``IMAP connection broken in reply''?  This is probably 
because the imapd has crashed.  Most likely, something in the 
server_login() routine in c-client/os_???.c (probably os_sco.c since you 
are using an SCO system) is failing for some reason.  Since I don't have 
access to any SCO system, I can't debug it myself.

Here's what you should do.  Become root (so imapd thinks it is not logged 
in and so it can log in), and then run imapd under a debugger.  After 
starting it, give a command such as:
	A001 LOGIN fred secret
(where ``fred'' is a user name and ``secret'' is a password).  If there's 
a problem, it'll probably crash at that point.  Figure out why it 
crashed, and fix it.

Another possibility may have to do with the mailbox format.  I believe 
that SCO uses MMDF format mailboxes.  The MMDF code in c-client is 
contributed code and I have no idea how well it actually works; I have 
never used either MMDF or SCO so all I can do is guess.

Good luck in debugging.  If you determine the problem and have a fix, 
please send it to me.

> I do have a link between imapd and rimapd

That would only affect passwordless access.  I don't think it is related 
to this problem.

One way of debugging server problems separately from the client
software, is just to telnet to the appropriate port: 
        telnet loghost 143      
( Or if it is in your /etc/services file, "telnet loghost imap" ) 
and type in the commands. ( And there just happens to be a sample 
exchange in RFC1176 ):

Steven,
There are at least two definitions of "Pine for Windows-NT".

  -The first would be a port of the current Pine, with its
   character-oriented user interface, to Win-NT. 

  -The second would be a true GUI application, based on Pine
   but not necessarily having any visible similarity, that
   ran on Win-NT.

As for UW plans: we definitely intend to make a Winsock/Windows version
of Pine, with its current user-interface, and this same code might port 
to NT without much difficulty.  

As for a full GUI version of Pine for Windows (and thereafter, perhaps
Win-NT): we've certainly talked about it, and if resources permit, and
other alternatives don't obviate the need, we will definitely be
considering such a project.

I have a "tiffview" which will allow me to view tiff files.  In the .pinerc
file if I define:


# Program to view images if format such as GIF and TIFF
image-viewer=/usr/local/bin/tiffview

Should this work, or what is the purpuse of this entry?

Thanks.

Steve

This is because of a small confusion about what the sv4 port of pine 
really is... its a sv4.2 port.  The sv4 port as distributed with 3.84 is 
a port to sv4.2, tested on several vendors and architectures.  The 
straight sv4 port was done on 3.84 (oh so long ago now :)), and needed 
some hacking to the order of header files etc, so the patches were REALLY 
long.  We decided to move straight to sv4.2, and also cover solaris, and 
hope that most people with ordinary sv4.0 would migrate forward in the 
fullness of time.  There are two or three hacks that must be done to the 
"sv4" port to make it work on 4.0.  Do you want the list?

Cheers.

Some terminal servers transtale ^C to break in their telnet.  This causes 
grief to our users when they try to cancel a message in compose mode.

The following code seems to make ^C work in pine, even with T.S. of this
kind:

% cd pico
% rcsdiff os_unix.c
RCS file: RCS/os_unix.c,v
retrieving revision 1.1
diff -r1.1 os_unix.c

>       c =  CTRL | 'C';
>       sleep(1);                 /* prevent local output flush problems */

Could this, please, be merged in the official distribution?

I have pico v2.1 compiled and running on all our rs6000s, except one.  
When you try and execute pico you get the error message: "Unknown 
terminal type vt220!"

The machines are setup alike as far as I know.  Aix version 3.2.0.  
Anyone have any idea what could be the problem?  I even re-compiled pico 
directly on the machine and still get the same error message.  

 -thanks

The problem seems to be that some AIX systems have a rather limited 
/etc/termcap database.  One solution proposed by a number of people 
is to recompile replacing "-ltermcap" with "-lcurses" in the 
makefile.a32.  Alternatively, you can copy an /etc/termcap from a 
machine that has a more complete one.  We are investigating changing 
the default for the next release, but have not decided for certain yet.

Pine currently assumes that "image-viewer" can handle gif, pgm, pbm, 
tiff, and jpeg image sub-types.  With that in mind, your definition 
should work.

Thanks for the quick replies.  Replacing -ltermcap with -lcurses does 
indeed correct the "Unknown terminal type" error

 -thanks again

P.S.  I've become a 'goddess' in the sight of my users since I've 
installed pico.  No more vi for them!

I use tin for reading news.  One of the neatest features is the
way it handles signature files.  It has a standard signature
(.sigfixed I think) like Pine does now, but also allows the
inclusion of a second, random signature.  For example, the
.tinrc file (?) contains a signature file option. If a directory
rather than a file is specified, tin will choose a random
file from that directory and include it after the standard
.sigfixed signature file.

I realize this isn't a practical feature, but it would be a neat
addition to Pine.

Just my 2 cents worth,

- Darryl

EXIT PROTOCOL:
--------------

I just lost several hours work when trying to leave pico.
When it asked "Save before leaving?", I had second thoughts
(I actually wanted to continue editing) and replied 'n'.  DAMN!

May I suggest that when the user specifies quit/discard
that they be asked: "Do you really want to lose your work?"

Suggest the following sequence:
	Do you really want to quit pico?  (y,n) [n]
If y:
	Do you want to save to <filename>? (y,n) [n]
if n:
	Do you REALLY want to lose your work? (y,n) [n]
if n:
	continue editing.


JUSTIFICATION ERRORS (^J):
--------------------------

Pico loses the double space at sentence end if the preceding sentence 
ends with: " )

To the list people:  This pine will process was mailing a user named 
will, and had been suspended.  Why would it still be sucking up CPU 
cycles while suspended.  If it matters, I had logged out without killing 
the job.

Pine 3.87 has an annoying little bug that crops up when you get 
disconnected while in the composer.  Basically, it is waiting for 
user input, detects an I/O failure, and tries to kill itself.  
Unfortunately, the signal handler just sets a flag and returns to the 
input loop :(

This will be fixed in Pine 3.88 which should be out later this week.

Yeah, neat feature!  Maybe I'll add it in my copious free time ;)

Of course, if you get ambitious, it would be pretty easy to hack it 
into the get_signature() function at the bottom of pine/reply.c and 
build your own :)

This has actually happened to me a few times. I am not sure that a 
sequence of messages is desirable though.  I hate stuff like this....

Do you want to save?
Are you sure you don't want to save?
All of your changes will be lost, last chance. Do you want to save?
OK, you don't want to save, but are you sure you want to exit now?
Postive? 

Cause idiots like me will just get used to hitting nnnyy out of habbit!

One possibility is to save it anyway in a 'last chance' file, sort of like
Pnews does.   

Example:

Modified buffer: Save before leaving (y/n)? n
A copy of the file was saved to .lastchance in case you change your mind

And only, of course, have one copy. Next time they quit without saving, 
.lastchance will be overwritten again.

Come to think of it, emacs does something similar with quits without saves.

Subject: Trying to Configure Pine
Reply-To: aherskow@alleg.EDU

Hi.  I am new to this list and Pine, and I was hoping that you experienced Pine  
users/administrators could help with a few questions I have.  I have read  
through the docs, but can't find the answers I need (maybe I don't have all the  
docs?!)  Most of these questions are specific to my platform, but others may be  
straight Pine configuration problems.

I am installing Pine for usage by our dial-up users.  I am working with Pine  
3.87 on a NeXTstation running NEXTSTEP 3.1.  I have everything compiled, and it  
works great, but there are a few problems I am having with the configuration:

1. e-mail address full name expansion:  This really isn't a problem because I  
have it working, but I feel like I used duct tape to make it work.  The way our  
campus mail configuration is (we have one mail server for approx 280  
workstations) all mail is sent to username@alleg.edu (no hostnames attached,  
just the domain name.)  All machines on campus mount /usr/spool/mail from the  
mailhost.  Also, the way our hosts are set, the "hostname" command will return  
"hostname" not "hostname.alleg.edu".  So... 

    a. if a Pine user composes mail, types in an on-campus address in the To:  
field, it is expanded to "Full Name <user@hostname>" which is incorrect (it  
should have the domain name and not the hostname).  

    b. If I set the "user-domain" variable in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf to  
"alleg.edu" then the e-mail address is now expanded to "user@alleg.edu" (correct  
e-mail address, but no full name expansion anymore...ugh!)  

    c. If I change the hostname of the machine so that the hostname command  
returns "hostname.alleg.edu", and set the "use-only-domain-name" variable in  
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf then the e-mail address is expanded to "Full Name  
<user@alleg.edu>" which is exactly what I want....hurray!

But, the problem with configuration "c" is that I now have 1 machine who's  
hostname includes the domain name, while all other 279 machines on campus don't  
include the hostname.  No big deal, but it would be nice to understand what is  
going on here.  Is there a NeXT Sys Admin out there that had the same problem?   
I figure that the full name expansion is done via netinfo, but why can't Pine do  
the full name expansion if you have "user-domain" set?!

2. I would like to hear from users running Pine on NeXTs.  I have been trying to  
see how compatable NeXTmail and Pine are:
    a. has someone written a script/program to put the ~/.NeXT/.mailaliases into  
the ~/.addressbook format (it should be simple, but I thought I would ask first)
    b. can Pine read NeXTmail attachements or handle the NeXTmail mailbox format  
(table_of_contents) with a driver of some sort?  Is Pine flexible enough that  
one could be written and sort of slapped on the side if you wanted?
    c. is there a NeXT application that I can use which will decode both  
NeXTmail and MIME attachments so that I don't have to give 2 different  
applications to my users (one for NeXTmail attachments and one for MIME)??
    d. Mail.app in NEXTSTEP 3.1 removes the /usr/spool/mail/username file after  
it gets the mail.  If no new mail has arrived and a user runs Pine, Pine  
complains when it starts up saying that INBOX doesn't exist and no folder is  
open and it beeps a few times.  I have a feeling that this will confuse our  
users (sounds sad doesn't it.)  Is there anyway around this?

3. Was Pine somewhat developed on a NeXT?!  I was surprised to see NeXT app MIME  
interfaces on ftp.cac.washington.edu.  Also, some references in the  
documentation refer to features being available on the NeXT, but not tested on  
other platforms.

4. Is there a specific technical document (besides the code) that details how  
Pine and netinfo communicate?

Thanks for your time,
Aaron

Possible enhancement: 

Printing to a local printer in pine is working well for our users from
most terminals or PC's. I'd like to have similar capabilities in pico.
Possible?

We have been mulling over the possibility of adding an optional
deleted-messages folder.  Perhaps these messages should go there as
well?

I attached the fax as a fax and sent it to the other box; that didn't
work.  I converted the fax to a tiff file and that didn't work.
I set the "image-viewer" to tiffview and that didn't work; all I got
was:
"don't know how to display attachment Image/TIFF"

Any suggestions?

One problem I see with this, we use pico as our default editor. Gets loaded
for lots of things, like when composing a message for Pnews or trn for 
example.  

Maybe just an internal command to retrieve last unsaved message. 

Sorry, I don't have a constructive suggestion on this one. I do fear 
feature overload though.

Sorry to take so long getting back to you.  The latest versions of
pine should successfully ferret out the correct name to save to.  BTW,
the current version is 3.87 but Pine 3.88 should be out in a few days. 

Thanks for the report!

Well, one of the big problems with providing a print capability from 
within pico is that we don't have any function keys left to call the 
new command from...  Probably the best advice we can offer is to save 
the file, exit pine (or suspend it), and use a utility like ansiprt, 
which is supplied in the contrib directory of the Pine distribution.

Hi -

     Here is an answer to some of your questions.  I don't know the answer to
all of them; hopefully one of my colleagues can fill in the blanks.

     Pine does not read NeXTmail attachments.  There are no plans to do so.
NeXTmail is a private format used only by NeXT.  The Internet standard is
MIME.  I have no idea when, or even if, NeXT plans to fix NeXTmail to use MIME
instead of their proprietary format; there have been reports of such work.

     I hope you appreciate the problems we face if we start trying to support
non-standard proprietary formats.  Even if we did, NeXTmail would be fairly
low on the priority list compared to cc:mail, Oracle, Microsoft Mail, etc.

     I have heard rumors of NeXT applications which will translate NeXTmail
into MIME, but I don't know of any directly.

     Personally, I recommend that you give serious consideration to abandoning
NeXTmail.  It is a dead end.  No other vendors support it, or to my knowledge
have any plans for future support, whereas many vendors support (or have
announced plans to support) MIME, including Microsoft.

     NeXTmail's hiding of mailboxes in its own private directory was a reason
(there were others) why NeXTmail was never seriously considered around here.
You could try adding a c-client module to Pine to recognize where NeXTmail
hides mail.  Take a look at the mbox module to see how you do subclassing of
the bezerk driver in c-client.  You may be able to win with a minor
modification to the mbox_file() routine, plus linking in the mboxdriver in the
pine.c main module via an appropriate mail_link() call.

     Pine was developed on a NeXT, as that was the workstation sitting on its
programmer's desk.  The current development platform is ULTRIX, although that
will change soon.  c-client, the underlying engine used by Pine, was
originally developed on a Macintosh, but has been homed on a NeXT for the past
five years.  However, the NeXT is used strictly as a BSD Unix clone.

     MailManager, the NeXT GUI application, was started at about the same time
as Pine, but development on it ended three years ago when it became clear that
NeXT wasn't going anywhere (there were tens of MailManager users compared to
thousands of Pine users back then...).  I still use MailManager, but it is
showing its age compared to Pine.  One benefit of MailManager is that it is a
NeXT GUI application and does interoperate completely with Pine.

     Pine uses the standard UNIX system calls for system information lookup.
There is no specific knowledge in Pine of NetInfo.

But what do you do if you're editting a Really Large File and have to 
worry about quotas?

I'm asking this question for a friend...Please forgive me!  :-)

Anyway, this friend of mine (login: schilkk) wishes to have pine change 
the loginname in the from line from schilkk@cs.orst.edu to 
rat@cs.orst.edu.  He knows how to change the domain to cs.orst.edu, but 
he wished to change the login as well.

We thought, at first, to change the smtp-server variable to a script that 
took STDIN and replaces all instances of schilkk with rat, but apparently 
smtp-server is looking for a machine name, rather than a 
binary...(defaulting to 'sendmail' is what confused us, I guess...)

Anyway, any help on this would be appreciated...

(He wishes to do this since the login rat@cs.orst.edu is actually a mail 
alias that beames his mail to several locations automagically...)

Later...

Perhaps something like "pico -r" to recover the file specified, like 
with vi?  That would probably be easier than an Emacs style recovery.

Are there any plans for a system-wide address book?  It would be nice if 
users could access both their private address book and a system-wide one.
Sorry if this something that has already be hashed through.

For me, it seems the intuitive thing is ...
after I give the 'exit' command,
  'n' should abort the immediately previous command (exit)
That is, 'n' should abort exit and return to editing.

I have started using ^O frequently during an edit session now!

Pine does not have a way to do that on Unix.  A future version of 
Pine will have support for the Reply-To header though...

Yes!!!  A future version of Pine will have support for system-wide 
addressbooks, as well as remote IMAP and IMSP addressbooks and 
probably X.500 directory services.

I like this idea a lot!  The flaw is that the user is quite likely to
forget what the magic lastchance file is called.  So, the next time pico
(or pine in compose-mode) is started by that user, it should alert them to
the existence of the backup file and ask if it should be recovered into
the editor.  It should do this even if the user has specified a filename
on the command line, since they may not realize how the recover feature
works.

Just to set expectations properly:
  -system-wide address books will probably happen before directory svcs;
  -x.500 has not yet been declared the winner in the d.s. sweepstakes...

Sorry about the delayed reply to this.  The "From " line is simply the
message separator for a particular mailbox format.  It is very unwise
to rely on this for anything else.  In particular, for the pure IMAP
case, the user has no control over or direct access to that line, if
it even exists in the format the particular server is using. 

Hope this helps!

I agree!  To me this would be the most useful enhancement to the Pine
*mailer*.  News reading, MS Windows, endless folders and other stuff just
isn't as important... to me anyway.

I do not believe that this would be possible in Pine.  What your friend 
is looking for is Sendmail with the IDA enhancement kit.  This version of 
Sendmail will allow him/her to define a translation table that will 
rewrite his address any way he wishes.

Hi folks, i was wonderinf if anyone could give me more information about
Microsoft (and other LAN packages), supporting IMAP and/or MIME.  Mr. Crispin
hints here that Microsoft will.  This could make for an interesting turn of
events in mail.  (How about Lotus?)

If I am remembering correctly you should *insert* the -lcurses in front
of the -ltermcap instead of replacing it.  Seems like there was
something needed from the -ltermcap library, too.

Now, if I could just eliminate the 'IOTrap...coredump' problem on AIX
3.2.3 I could use the binary I get with the above method instead of
having to have a friend build it for me somewhere on a 3.2.4 system.

According to some of the reports floating around
at U of M,  both Lotus and Microsoft have indicated
that they will be adding MIME at some point. I
have no idea of what the time frame would be...

As for IMAP, I don't think that is in the cards,
IMHO.

When Reply-To: support is added to Pine, it would be very useful if the
feature whereby Pine puts a "+" next to a message in the index, could be
enhanced to recognise the user's Reply-To: variable, and consequently make
the operation of "+" more useful.

This problem is by no means restricted to ^-C; we are using LWP (on our 
Novell network) which uses ^-O to send "client system break", this
inhibiting the "postpone" function.

Hello,
I have made a system wide pine.conf file which forces the users to the 
mail-directory Mail (with big M) for compatibility with elm. Now, when a 
new user invokes pine who hasn't used elm before, pine can't create the 
necessary folders. I think, this is a bug or isn't it???

Kind Regards

Guenter

I won't claim to be an AIXpert, but as far as I can tell, libcurses.a 
is a strict superset of libtermcap.a, at least as far as Pine is 
concerned.

The AIX system I have been testing on is running AIX 3.2.3, though I 
wouldn't vouch for a vanilla installation, and it does not have any 
problem with Pine.  If you could send me a stack trace from a 
coredump, I'll see if I can spot anything.

I'd received in the past some information about a cc:Mail <--> SMTP
gateway that automatically converts cc:Mail attachments to/from MIME.
I've no experience with this product as, unfortunately, we're using a
less ambition gateway.  This is no the same as native support, but
helps.  I don't recall the product.

I read in some industry rag that the next major release of cc:Mail will
include native MIME support.  Sorry, cannot recall the reference.  I do
recall that it was not expected for quite some time.

I remember there was a discussion about two months ago about
people going over quota because of the sent mail folder.  But
I don't remember if this question was addressed at the time --

Can we turn off use of the sent mail folder?  I did not see
a place in .pinerc or pine.conf to do this but I have the
nagging feeling it ought to be possible.

I think all you have to do is set the default-fcc="" (maybe?) I know it's 
possible...

Reply-To: aherskow@alleg.EDU

Thanks to Mark for his comments and explanations.  I hope that everyone didn't  
interpret my enthusiasm for NeXTSTEP as a monogamous operating system stance -  
we have platforms running Ultrix, HP-UX, SunOS, MS-DOS, Mac.  We are realistic  
about other OSs, we just think that the NeXTSTEP environment currently suits  
*our* user's needs (in both software development and ease of use) even if it  
isn't anywhere near widely accepted.

I can understand the Pine programmers not supporting NeXTmail; I wouldn't  
expect that.  But I was wondering if any Pine users had taken it upon  
themselves to write something for Pine that can read/send in the NeXTmail  
proprietary format.  I guess I can assume that there aren't too many NeXT users  
on this list  :-)

I would still like to know if any of my problems that are not totally NeXT  
related can be solved:

1. if /usr/spool/mail/username doesn't exist, Pine complains and refuses to  
open the INBOX (understandable since it isn't there.)  Even if new mail arrives  
to /usr/spool/mail/username, the user will not be notified since the INBOX  
folder is not open.  I realize that the cause of this is created by the NeXT  
GUI mail application, but is there a simple work-around?

2. does a hostname need to contain the domain name to enable full name  
expansion in the addressable fields?  If I set "user-domain" in pine.conf, full  
name expansion doesn't work.

Thanks again,
Aaron

Hello,
in order to compile this package on aix 3.2.4 with build a32 I have to 
add an include statement to pine3.87/c-client/os_a32.c

#include <sys/time.h>

I think, it is easy to add this statement in the distribution.

BTW, there was the same behavior in 3.85

Kind Regards

I have 2 items on my wish-slip:

1. I would like to sort my (user's) Addressbooks on the first (nick-name)

2. I should prefer a small-as-possible pine.hlp, i think some information

Does anybody else experience core files when using the following command?

    % xterm -e pine &

After I quit pine, I find that pine left a core file.  I'm using 3.87 but 
have noticed it before with previous versions too.

Actually, the keyboard locking was changed to avoid having to code for 
the myriad of shadow password schemes we would have to deal with 
otherwise.  Likewise, the disk space usage is impossible to determine 
when folders are mounted remotely via IMAP so we decided to take the path 
of least confusion...

Thanks for the report and sorry for the late reply!

Hello, 

the last few weeks we have made pine public available to our users. I have
created a few scripts to help them to convert their alias files. They are
written quick and dirty for AIX 3.2.4. The functions used in awk are
available in nawk on the sun platform. Maybe you can put them into the
distribution... 

Kind Regards

We are running into problems with the automatic attempt to use rimapd in
the new versions of pine.  Here's the problem:

User starts up PINE to our mail server.  Rsh et al are not allowed to this
machine (using method similar to tcp_wrapper).  Some O/S's rsh client do not
handle this situation well - they hang when the original TCP connection is
accepted but then shutdown and the return connection (for stderr) is not
established.  They hang forever.  The user can't get to their mail.  This
happens with clients running Ultrix 4.3, SunOS 4, Solaris, Risc/OS and AIX
(at least, so far).  In fact, the only client that will work so far is
running Irix.

Perhaps it was not a good idea to take this automatic rimapd approach,
considering modern security awareness...

David, what is the status of the keyboard locking in 3.88?  Have you
changed it so the user types it in twice, or uses the system password in
some way?  Or are you saying that it *was* changed in 3.87?  Sorry, I
don't remember how it worked in previous versions. 

However, something is seriously wrong with the way it works now, that is 
the user hits "K" and types any password and the keyboard is locked.  I 
have had several calls where the user didn't even realize they hit K, and 
inadvertantly locked their terminal.  I hope it is not a big problem for 
you folks to change this function.

I had this problem. I solved it with this script:

	#!/bin/sh

	pine $*
	sleep 1

I called it 'mypine' and then I use:

	xterm -e mypine &

I just spent a week at the Email World conference at which I talked with some
of the engineers in Microsoft.   At this time they have not even started 
adding MIME support to their gateway products.   They indicated that they 
did not have any plans to support MIME as the native message format for 
Microsoft Mail messages.   They do have a plan to support X.400 message formats
at some point in the future.  

Cheers.

Amos,

This is very similar to a problem reported using the Sun cmdtool.  We 
have made some changes for Pine 3.88 that will hopefully help the 
situation, but we still need to do some more testing on it.

Thanks for the report!

I fairly regularly notice cores from Pine, but never notice it crashing.  They
don't occur every time I quit Pine, but I am running in an xterm in much the
same way as you.

I've got a 16-page MSWord doc that I put together mostly out of the online help
for Pine. I included a number of screen shots and some local UMD information.
I've also got a two-page shorter version that just gets people started.

Be glad to send a binhex version to anyone who's interested.

How a version of pine for the PC that will dialout a modem and connect to do
imapd (or pop) mail, via modem. This way on the road I could get my mail 
without long connect times.

Keith,
This is on our wish list also, and planned for 1H94... 

Pine works fine via dialup IP (SLIP or PPP) but we will add an "offline
mode" where it doesn't try to send mail immediately, and provide for
saving (downloading) all or all new messages in one operation to minimize
connect time.  Later there will be a richer set of "aggregate" operations
to allow saving all messages that match particular criteria.  This will be
done via IMAP, rather than POP, so that one can choose to save/download a
*subset* of messages from the INBOX and choose to keep or expunge from the
server the subset of messages that was saved.

Hey, why not send it as a regular attachment?  That's what this MIME

I've received quite a few request for copies of our long and short Pine
documents (I've also got a short pico handout). Some folks have requested I send
them a binhexed version or BASE64 or uuencode, some that I ftp it, and some that
I include it as MIME enclosure to the mailing list.

Would it be overtaxing things to send out the docs as an enclosure to the whole
list? This would seem to be a nice way to get things out to everyone, but I
don't want to overload a lot of people's mailboxes. Also, these are Mac MS Word
files. To include them as a MIME enclosure I'd need to transfer them as a binary
file to my unix account and have Pine include the files in a message. In order
not to lose any resource fork or Finder information I'd have to put the binary
file I transfer up in MacBinary format. Would it be useful to most folks to get
a MIME binary enclosure of a Macbinary formatted file?

I'm willing to send things out in a couple of different ways, but I thought I'd
see if there was any one method that would work out for all or most people.

I think what we're getting into here is a more general discussion of what
techniques are the most useful for doing these kinds of file transfers. I'll
wait a day or so hear and see if we hear any specific suggestions or general
opinions on this topic.

For disconnected operation to be useful for our users they would
need the ability to queue requests to file messsages into folders
while disconnected.  When PINE reconnected via IMAP or whatever
the message filing requests would be executed.

Also not clear to me how well SLIP/PPP will work when users are accessing
the host via dialup into international X.25 networks - as anyone tried this?

If I recall correctly, MSWord files don't have a resource fork, so they could 
probably be transfered as straight binary -- that way they could be read by 
PC-type machines into WinWord or some other conversion program. A MIME 
attachment to e-mail (MacBinary, RTF, ETC) would be the preferred method.

Depends how big the files are but it's traditional to make them available
via anonymous ftp.  If you don't want to or can't then the next best
method is to MIME them to the list.  If we are seriously advocating MIME
for multi-media mail then lets' use it!  MACWord files shouldn't require
fork information - if it does then we have major problems ahead of us when
documents such as MSWord files have to be exchanged more often between
PCs, MACs and unix platforms.  I can read just about all of the more
popular word processor files generated by PCs and MACs on my unix
workstation via DECwrite (and I presume there are other perhaps better
alternatives like Framemaker).  So let's use MIME for the transport to
push the documents around to try it out.  If it doesn't work then
perhaps MIME is a lame duck and needs major changes.

I've given my 2 cents worth.

Well, hope I'm not making too big a deal out of offering to share some 
Pine handouts I've created, but I'm also using this to get some 
experience in various ways of sharing files with the net community.

As quite a few people requested, I've included as MIME attachments to this
message the three handouts I mentioned. Each attachment is the binary
data fork of a Macintosh MS Word 5.1 file. You'll need to replace the
missing Finder information yourself (file type: WDBN, creator type: MSWD).
I hope the size of these files (10K, 10K & 60K) doesn't create problems
with various mailers. I guess we'll find out through experience.

I'm also trying an experiment and have made various formats of these 
files available from my Mac via anonymous ftp, gopher, and AppleShare.

To ftp the files, ftp to jness.d.umn.edu. 

To get to the files via gopher, open a gopher connection to 
jness.d.umn.edu, port 70. They are in a directory called "Exchange Folder".
If you're on a Mac using TurboGopher you should be able to transfer the 
.hqx format files directly to Word files on your hard disk.

If you're on the UofMN AppleTalk network you should be able to open an 
AppleShare connection directly to my Mac (jness in zone UMD-MWAH) and 
copy the 3 files from the Exchange Folder.

Below is the contents of a README file I've placed in the ftp/gopher 
Exchange Folder directory.

*****************************
The Pine and Pico documentation in this directory comes in three formats.

1. The xxx.hqx files are the original MSWord 5.1 files displayed to you 
as binhex files by the FTPd ftp/gopher server software running on my Mac. 
If you transfer them via ftp you should receive a standard MacBinary encoded 
binhex file. However, since the .hqx extension is added by the FTPd 
display filter, you may not be able to do a wildcard get (mget C8*.hqx). 
Typing the entire filename, including the ".hqx" should work.

2. The xxx.rtf files are Microsoft Rich Text Format saved out of MS Word. 
These are plain ascii text format files. 

3. The xxx.uu files are uuencoded files containing the data resource of 
the original Microsoft Word file. You will have to manually add the file 
type (WDBN) and creator type (MSWD) using one of the usual utilities such 
as ResEdit on the Mac.
***********************************

Please let me know whether you are able to get these files via the 
enclosures here or one of the other methods. I suppose some feedback on the 
docs themselves might be nice, too, but the sharing process is actually 
becoming of more interest to me.

There's probably a good chance I've messed up on some of my preparations 
or instructions, but we'll live and learn. Let me know if you have problems.

If you set your INBOX-PATH variable to be INBOX, this should correct this
problem.

You neglected to mention that this documentation is based on PINE 3.05!
If anyone redoes this for the current releases, I would be grateful!

Ah, very true. We'll be converting to the new version over the Christmas break
and I'll be updating the docs. If folks are still interested, I'll make the
updated versions available from my computer in the same ftp and gopher manner.

The changes should be fairly minor, however, so it wouldn't take too much work
for anyone to modify my documents (especially since they'll need to be modified
to remove local UMD information anyway). Since I cribbed most of these docs from
the Pine on-line help I see nothing wrong with anyone just modifying my
documentation a little and making it their own.

There are lots of comp.mail newsgroups.
It's about time (!) we had a comp.mail.pine newsgroup.
And an anonymous ftp site for distributed AND contributed files.

I ran into a problem the other day with a professor who wanted to create a
mailing list in pine for her nursing class. The problem was that with the
name expansion sent off to sendmail, it blew sendmail's atom limit or
something and currently the mail is still sitting in the queue. 

I had hacked elm at one point to not expand local addresses. Is this 
something easily done in pine or not recommended or what?

I'm basically saying, if I send to dave (@localaddress)
I'd like it to be sent to dave 
       not                David A. Rasmussen <dave@csd4.csd.uwm.edu>

It would take a few months and carefully following the procedures. Start
to read news.groups carefully, and also news.announce.newgroups. If
everyone is interested, I can start the process going.  However, it should
be discussed on the mailing list here for a while. 

One requirement is that it will eventually go out to vote and this will
require 100 more yes votes than no, and at least 2/3 majority in favour.

One sure fire way of making some of those overly-sensitive news admins
to vote against a group is not following the procedures!

BTW, I would support the group. Reading news beats having tons of mail.

        Umm...   I didn't write the other program mentioned above.
There are two.   Also,  in creating that,  I was bitten yet again by the
"plain text" != "plain text"  problem,  where  SMTP  appears to be
plain text,  822 and 821 read as if plain text is the intention,
but some implementations (pine) get away with a stricter definition.

        The problem was ... on VM systems there's no such thing as a
completely empty line.   So a line that looks empty will have at least
one blank space,  maybe more.   Elm didn't care;  I seem to recall that
ZMail didn't care either;  but Pine was  NOT HAPPY  that the blank line
following the header wasn't really empty.   :-(

        So I fixed my migration tool to write the UNIX mbox file in
binary.   Pine is *still* unhappy with the notebooks I create.   This is
with  3.07,  though.   Gimme a chance to try again whenver we upgrade.

        CMS NAMES and CMS NAMEFIND,  yes indeed!   We  "really really"
need a tool on UNIX like CMS' NAMES and NAMEFIND utilities.   Hmmm...
this should also cross into the SMTP/822/MIME discussion where Greg
Vandreuil's Application/Signature has been getting kicked around.
I'll do that in a separate posting to follow that thread's subject line.

        Here's my App/Sig which comes to you from my NAMES file:

            Name: Rick Troth, RUA
            Email: troth@rice.edu
            Telephone:
            Fax:
            Address: 11558 Withers Way Circle;Houston, TX 770xx
            Portrait:

        Don't have my portrait in there yet.   :-(    Soon though.
And there's no phone or FAX at the new house.   There are also other
fields that App/Sig defines.   Anyway,  the point of this is that
NAMES gives me a general purpose flat-file plain-text user-maintainable
database for this kind of information.

        My supervisor in a previous life once created a UNIX 'names'
program.   It kept the database in  $HOME/.names.   (file is called
<userid> NAMES  in the CMS implementation)   I don't think it was
ever integrated,  though.   Surely would be nice,  though,  if such a
generic tool were available and used by at least  *one*  application.
I believe others would follow ... if the tool were simple enough
while still reliable.   RiceMAIL uses CMS NAMES because it's there,
it's easy to use,  interfacing with it is trivial.

        The format of a CMS NAMES file is:

                :tag.data :tag.data :tag.data  ...

        where the tag  ":nick."  is sacred and delimits entries.
The tags can be anything you like.   The CMS NAMES program defines
the following fields:

            Nickname, Userid, Node (historical that node is separate),
            Notebook (where to log mail for this person),
            Name, Phone, and Address (surface mail, that is),
            and  "List of Names"  which is a group alias definition.

        Usually,  though,  I don't even use NAMES.   I just edit the
file by hand.   It's too easy.   The NAMEFIND tool is invoked by
any application that wants to extract data from this database.

        I think I wrote a crefty tool once to read NAMES format on UNIX.
It's been a *long* time,  though.   And since I haven't gotten around to
writing my own mail user agent snickerY I haven't had an occasion to
actually  *use*  the generic tool.

>\Oved

        I'm really glad you mentioned NAMES.   Let's see it happen!

The question or a Pine newsgroup comes up from time to time.  Our position is
that we do not object to it, but we cannot supply any additional management
resources for it.  As far as anonymous ftp access, we will be happy to
distribute contributions.  Currently, most of the contributions are rolled
into the source distribution in the contrib directory.  Would it be more
beneficial for users if we maintained a separate mail/contrib directory on
ftp.cac.washington.edu?

Can I infer from this that you are saying that if a newsgroup did exist,
that the Pine development team would not have the time to read it?  Since
if this is so, then the effectiveness of the group would be greatly
diminished.

Of course, there is always a two-way news<->newsgroup gateway but they can
be ugly to maintain and occasionally blow up -- plus I have no experience
setting one up myself...

No, if it is created we will read it, but we won't commit to gateway 
management, etc.  Sorry about the confusion.

John,

Sorry about the delay in responding to this.  The order of the headers does
not really matter as far as pine is concerned.  Was the program perchance mh? 
If so, the Pine distribution contains a contributed driver for mh-style
mailboxes that provides read-only access if I remember correctly.  It is not
linked into Pine by default because it is still experimental and incomplete. 
If you would like to experiment with it, send a note to
pine@cac.washington.edu and we will give you a few pointers. 

Hope this helps!

Is there a way to save an outgoing message into a folder of the "to" address
and have it ask you if that is where you want to save it rather than 
putting it in save-messages?

Thanks.

If there are any VMS users out there who need to bulk convert VMSmail
folders to pine folders, send me e-mail and I'll send you a copy of the
command files.  This version runs slow since it's in DCL but when I get
time I might re-write it in C if there's enough demand for it.

Hi there! 

It might be a stupid problem.  How can I use pine to connect newsgroup

Now this sounds very interesting to me!!!  Are you running Pine on a VMS
system?  Or are you running a IMAP server on VMS (i.e., PMDF's) on a VMS
system?

If the latter, IYHO how well does the client work with the PMDF IMAP server? 
The only apparent 'thorn' I've noted was the new additions to folders (notably
new incoming mail) does not appear unless you log off and relog into the
server. But, to be fair, it's not really Innosoft's fault (but rather it's a
"feature" of VMS callable mail).  Nonetheless, if this is what you are doing,
I'd be interested in hearing how much of a problem this really is (perhaps the
users really don't consider this to be a problem??)

Our users would probably would like have an alternative to VMS Mail and Pine
would rank high in my book since I used to use it a while back when I was
working on Unix systems (but we only have VMS at my present location).

Is there a way to produce a distribution listing so that when you mail to 
that distribution, it won't have the list of all the people you are 
mailing to?

I have a couple of lists with upwards to 50 people (and growing), and it 
gets a little tiring for them to get their daily mailing and have to weed 
through two or three pages of names of people who got the same mailing.

Robert,

Sure, just hit ^R to get rich headers and put the listname in the Bcc.  
That way the recipients will only see their own name.

Thanks for the interest!

Any chance that a fuuture version will allow this on the normal address 
line?  Remembering to ^R and use Bcc could be a pain.

Actually, when using BCC, the recipient will see the originator's name (in
the From: ) line, but they will not see their own nor any other recipient's
name, as there will not be a To: line.

on VM, the rice mailbook package will show the first 5 in the list and
hide the rest for you so you don't have to page down 10 times to read
a 3 line message :-)
perhaps a future version of pine could do this?

L.S.

I have send this request before, probably it's somewere on some network:

1. I would like to sort my (user's) Addressbooks on the first (nick-name)
   column (in Unix- and PC-Pine as well).

2. I should prefer a small-as-possible pine.hlp, i think some information
   could be placed in (one or more) separated readme-file(s) such as:
   If ^C Doesn't Work on a Mac / What is MIME / History and Origin of Pine /
   Pine x.x update / Pine contributors / Copyright notice ...

With kind regards,

Tjeerd,
We've put #1 on the ever-growing requested enhancement list, but I'd like 
to now more about your motivation for #2... (I assume you're referring to 
pc-pine), but why would you prefer many small help files to one big one?

Hi there! 

It might be a stupid question.  How can I use pine to connect 
newsgroup and ftp sites?

Henry,
Re using Pine to read news: Here is the applicable line from my .pinerc 
file.  Substitute the name of your own news host...

  news-collections=News *{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}[]

Note that this assumes you have a preexisting .newsrc file on the machine 
where you are running Pine.  Pine does not yet have support for posting 
to newsgroups, nor for subscribing/unsubscribing.

If your .newsrc lives on the same machine as the news database, and that 
machine runs and IMAPd, then you can omit the /nntp and use IMAP to access
news.

Re FTP sites: In the future we will be announcing an IMAPd that, if run on
an anonymous FTP server, will allow Pine users to have convenient access
to all the files in that FTP archive (not just the mailboxes in it), but
this is not ready yet.

Why not gateway this mailing list to a news group in the bit.*
hierarchy.  That way the same information would be available
via the list and the newsgroup.  Users could either reveive mail,
or they could read the same messages in the newsgroup.

Hi,

If it can, how does a user set her .pinerc settings?

Also, with delete-skips-deleted added to the feature-list, "N" does not
skip the next message if it has been marked for deletion. Am I missing
something?

thanks,

Yes, it can.  From an earlier reply on the same subject:

Here is the applicable line from my .pinerc file.  Substitute the name of
your own news host... 

  news-collections=News *{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}[]

Note that this assumes you have a preexisting .newsrc file on the machine
where you are running Pine.  Pine does not yet have support for posting
to newsgroups, nor for subscribing/unsubscribing.

You're not missing anything... I guess you are requesting a
"next-skips-deleted" option, (but then it becomes more challenging to ever
get back to a deleted msg).   Note that TAB skips deleted and already seen
msgs.

Pine - rev. 3.07 

We have a user who put a .forward token in his home directory to send mail to
another system that he can access from home as a local call.  Everything
works fine for individual mail.

When, however, his local address on our system is included in a
distribution list, the entire list breaks.  No one on the list seems to
get the mail; individuals included as cc: don't get the mail, no error is
returned to the originator (the mail is appropriately appended to sent-mail).
I have not located any errors in the sendmail logs, although I'm not sure
what I should be looking for.

I didn't see anything obvious in the .pine-debug files, either.

Is this peculiar to 3.07, and fixed in 3.85+?  We've been waiting for Pine
to be stable for a few weeks before upgrading, and planning to do it
during the end-of-quarter break.

I vote for a newsgroup.  A smaller, more technically related, mailing 
list may still be needed.

I'd say it depeneds on the volume of contrib directory.

ok.  this may be an easy question, but I haven't found a way to do
it....Is it possible to get pine to work in "POP Mode" (i.e. connect,
download mail to local folder, disconnect, read/respond to mail, then
reconnect at some later time, and send all new mail on it's way)

thanx...alex...

Hello,

	I've got a Sequent, when I do a uname I get the following info:

SEQUENT SEQUENT 3.2.0 V1.2.5 i386

	Also the login shows: DYNIX/ptx(R) V1.2.5

	In trying to build pine 3.87 I used "build dyn" and I get:

[This is probably more a question that should go to pine-bugs (a small 
group of people at Univ. of Wash.) instead of pine-info (lots of people 
around the world).  So I suggest your reply go only to pine-bugs, unless 
you really wanted the bigger list.]

I'd like to understand the details a little more.  You have userA above
with the .forward file.  Then userB has a Pine distribution list which
contains userA as one of the addressees.  If userB sends to that list, no
mail is delivered.  If userB removes userA from that list, it works.  If
userB sends to just userA, that works, too.  This is true for users other
than userB, too.  Does this sound like a correct description of the
problem?

It is possible that there is some 3.07 bug causing this, though I don't 
remember anyone having a problem similar to this.  If your system is one 
of the common ones we have made a binary version for, it would be useful 
to attempt to reproduce the problem with a newer binary.

Perhaps you could send us a copy of an address book that exhibits the 
problem, too.  And maybe the sendmail syslogging in the neighborhood of 
the time when the message is sent.  Thanks.

You are using PTX, the SysV flavor of Dynix.  So you want to use ``build ptx''
instead of ``build dyn''.

Mmmmm....  interesting. I  am not  an e-mail  guru but  this tidbit  has
turned on  the "oh,  so that's it"  light. I am  a SysAdmin  for several
systems here including (this) VM/CMS  System and (those) AIX 3.2 Systems
where I use pine/pico for MUA.

I notice that  using my MUA for  this system -- RiceMail --  that when a
BCC: is used  a TO: is required  -- meaning that "this item  is going to
somebody and  one or more  Blind Carbon Copies  are going to  some other
people"  which seems  to  be a  logical operation.  (You  gotta have  an
'original'  for  there to  be  carbon  copies.)  Just  for the  sake  of
clarification, RiceMail and pine are not  competitive -- pine is no more
suitable for  VM/CMS than  RiceMail would  be for unix.  They both  do a
very similar menu-type MUA for each of these non-alike platforms, so I'm
*not* saying "why doesn't this MUA work like that MUA".

There have  been occasions when  some undeliverables have fallen  to the
electronic floor  down at the electronic  post office and in  looking at
those  items there  is  not 'To:'  --  only 'Apparently-To:'  addresses.

Is the absence of a 'To:' valid?  I should think 'To:' would be required
for  CC: and/or  BCC: operation.  Or  does it  matter to  the MTA  (Mail
Transport Agent) handling delivery?

This  is not  a rhetorical  question,  nor even  a vital  one. I'm  just
curious about this for better understanding.

I think a news group is fine, but I think the mailing list needs
to be kept in its entirety.  There are still many people who
don't have news available so the mailing list reaches a much
larger audience -- particularly since the subject is e-mail.

The biz.sco news hierarchy is an excellent example of a small
news group that has a bi-directional news gateway to a mailing
list.  This has been working well for several years, and a large
percentage of the readers don't have news access.

What I did is to mail to one user then blind copy to the distribution listing.

Bill,

Pine does not complain unless *all* destinations are blank, including "Fcc:" 
The Fcc-only case is broken in Pine 3.87, but it will be fixed in 3.88.  I
have not seen any Transport problems with Bcc-only mail...

Ed,

Pine 3.88 will include a "pt1" port which I put together on a PTX 1.4 
system.  Hopefully it will work on your 1.2 system...

The Apparently-To is added by sendmail, which is trying to be helpful, I 
guess.  It is not a standard.  We've disabled this feature in our sendmail.

The absence of a To is valid.  RFC822 says you need at least one 
destination address, which can be a bcc.  RFC821 doesn't really care 
about headers at all, it just cares about envelope addresses, which you 
certainly do have in this case.

Sunjay,

We used to include a "ul3" port, but it was so far out of date that we 
dropped it.  The newest version of the ul3 port I see in our archives is 
for Pine2.30 :(

At this point it would be easier to start over...

Sorry I don't have better news.

Chris,

Sorry about the abysmal response time.  Pine does not require any of the
address fields to be filled in.  It is quite common for users to send mail
with only the Bcc: field when sending to large distribution lists.  Can 
you be a bit more specific about what problems you are having?  A copy of 
a bounced message would be quite helpful.

Thanks for the report!

Laurie,

Apologies for the abysmal response time.  The problem with this approach is
that only IMAP clients compiled with your changes will be able to use your
rimapd.  This will become more serious if you want to use commercial clients
that do not come with source in the future.  With that in mind, I am afraid
we must pass on this change. 

Thanks for the suggestion!

Dave,

The initial-keystroke-list is a fairly new feature and still needs some 
polish as you have found.  It should continue to improve over the next 
several versions.

We will have a more appropriate 'new pine version' message for Pine 3.88.

Thanks for the report!

OK - but it would be nice if all applications were configurable as to 
where the rimap daemon is located.

I want to get Pine 3.87 to access my MMDF format mailbox(es) (i.e. 
mailboxes where messages are separated by 2 rows of 4 CTRL-A's).  The 
c-client code appears to support such mailboxes but when I set

inbox-path=~/.mail

where ~/.mail is an MMDF format mailbox, I just get

/u/cc/s/ccsap/.mail is not a folder

when I run pine.  Any ideas?

Andy Powell.

Hi -

In order to enable MMDF support, you need to add a mail_link(&mmdfdriver) call
in pine.c.  You will probably have to do some other hacking as well; at the
present time the bezerkdriver and the mmdfdriver do not tolerate each other
very well.  Also, it isn't clear how well the mmdfdriver actually works; it is
contributed code.

I have recently spent a great deal of effort with c-client (it's now available
with IMAP toolkit 3.2, mail/imap-3.2.tar.Z on ftp.cac.washington.edu) to get
mmdfdriver and bezerkdriver to co-exist and a number of other highly desirable
internal improvements.  This doesn't answer whether or not the mmdfdriver
actually works (I don't know, not having an MMDF system to play with), but it
should make experimentation with MMDF format much easier.

This required some rather large changes throughout c-client and therefore this
*won't* be in Pine 3.88.  I have high hopes for Pine 3.89...

You can try substituting the c-client from IMAP toolkit 3.2 in place of the c-
client that comes with Pine, but note that this is an unsupported
configuration.  Also note that IMAP toolkit 3.2 is still very new and
experimental and is not at all stable.  We aren't even running it in-house; my
machine at home is presently the only machine using it!

C-client does indeed have a contributed MMDF port, but unfortunately it 
does not co-exist peacefully with the bezerk driver.  To add it to Pine, 
edit pine/pine.c and replace the line

    mail_link((DRIVER *)&bezerkdriver);

with

    mail_link((DRIVER *)&mmdfdriver);


Please note that we do not have any MMDF systems here and have done no 
direct testing of the code.  There has been some question in the past 
about variations in the MMDF format, so be aware of that.

Good Luck!

This is probably in the Pine FAQ and I would look there if I knew where it

How does one post messages to USENET newsgroups from PC-Pine?

Thank you.

Subject: HP Terminal support for PINE and PICO -- Patch Included
Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1993 17:58:30 -0700
From: Daniel Simmons <simmdan@kenya.isu.edu>


OK.  I finally got around to patching up pine and pico so that they will
work (mostly) with HP-type terminals.  There are two basic problems with
HP terminals:

1. Arrow keys -- The contributed patch supplied with the latest releases
   of pine helps here but didn't quite fix all my problems.

2. Use of reverse video -- HP terminals use "magic cookies" to mark
   where display enhancements (reverse, bold, underline, etc.) start
   and stop on a particular line.  They DO NOT work in a stream
   oriented mode like dec terminals (and the rest of the world).  This
   means that if you want a particular region of the screen to be in
   reverse, you must:

	- move to the target location (DO THIS FIRST)
	- turn on reverse video
	- write the stuff
	- turn off reverse video (do this BEFORE moving away)
	- move to next location

   Pine and pico were built on a very different set of assumptions
   about how terminals work.  (You can detect the mutant HP terminal
   stuff by looking for xs in termcap or xhp in terminfo.)

So, I jumped into the code and hacked things a bit.  The patch
included below will fix 90% of the problems.  Unfortunately, most of
the changes are MAJOR hacks.  The terminal library for pine
incorporates move to a location and print into one routine expecting
to turn reverse on and off from outside that routine.  My solution was
to add extra moves before turning reverse on and off.

The results:

	- Pine seems to work great from both HP and other terminals.
	- Other terminals will have two or three extra (useless) bytes
	  sent on occasion, but this seems relatively minor.
	- Pico occasionally screws up the highlighting of blocks (it
	  also has a rather annoying tendancy to loose the mark, but
	  I'm not so sure that I introduced this one).
	- Pico only highlights the first character during spell checks
	  instead of the whole word.
	- Standalone pico has a very slightly different "modified"
	  message displayed in the titlebar which hides a reverse
	  glitch.  (You wouldn't notice if I didn't tell you, but you
	  might wonder why in the world I modified that particular
	  message.)

Shameless plea to the wonderful maintainers of pine (was that
obsequious enough? :-):

  Is there any way we could work together to incorporate more general
  versions of these patches into the actual pine code so that they
  will be present in future releases?  The code in these patches could
  have been written much better, but that would have required
  restructuring your terminal i/o libs...  I just wanted to make the
  minimal changes to get it working (proof of concept?).

Enough of all that.  Here are the patches.  Use at your own risk.  Oh,
by the way, I #ifdef'd everything with the symbol HPTERM_SUPPORT.  So,
I also am including patches to makefile.hpp in the pine and pico
subdirectories which add -DHPTERM_SUPPORT to the C compiler flags.

For curiosity sake...  If you use these patches, would you please drop
me an email to let me know.  Thanks.

Stephen,

Pine does not have the ability to post news yet.  We are tentatively 
hoping to have posting capability by next summer.

Dear Sir,

	I have recently came across a problem of using Pine 3.05 in our NFS
environment.

	If a user's home directory is at local hard disk (not NFS mounted),
 we never came across the problem. However, if a user's home directory is NFS
 mounted, user can only send mail and cannot open other folders, the terminal
 will be hung up. Folder INBOX is marked "READONLY". Then, a dead pine process
 will stay on the workstation and cannot be killed by user or super user.

	Our environment is :

	 Application server : HP9000/755 running HP-UX 9.01 

	 NFS server : HP9000/800 model G50 running 9.0

	I have also used the newly created Pine 3.87, and the problem still 
happens.

	If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

	Thanks & regards.

have lots more, but this is all I can remember right now :-)

1)  ABILITY TO START EDITING WITH THE CURSOR AT THE END OF THE FILE
	If you are editing a long file (say, over 50k)	and you save it, 
	you then enter again with the cursor back at the top of the file.
	If there was a flag to allow you to start at the last line of the
	file it would be great.  (I use pico as a daily journal program,
	and each entry appends to that day's file, so that' where a 
	command line flag would be useful to me).

2)  GLOBAL FIND AND REPLACE
	'nuff said, really.  :-)

3)  BETTER ABILITY TO MOVE WITHIN A FILE
	Right now, the only way to go to any location is to either page
	down to it or to hope you remember a word in that area and then 
	do a word search.  If there was a way to have a 'goto' command, 
	that would be most helpful.

	How it might work:
		You can provide pico with some control sequence to have
		a 'goto' prompt.  You can then give it a number.  This
		number is a percentage.  0 is the top of the file, 100
		is the bottom, and in-between is, well, in-between.

---

Oh well, just some thoughts.

I went to build it on our alpha just now and it couldn't find osf
files in the c-client directory. I swear there was alpha support
there. My mind must be gone.

Is there support for the alpha/osf platform?

Dave,

There are actually two c-client trees in Pine 3.85 and higher.  Make sure 
that imap/ANSI/c-client was linked to c-client by build.  

Thanks for the report!

Use Compose and mail your message to news-group-name@cs.utexas.edu

NB use hyphens (-) instead of periods (.) in the group name.

Subject: Getting pico to work from within Pnews


It appears that newsposts from with Pnews using pico as an editor aren't
making it into newsgroups.  While this isn't actually a pine-related
question, I'd ask the list's indulgence, in the hopes that a pico (or
Pnews guru) might have a thought.

Thanks in advance.

I think I located a possible area...  It appears that there needs to be
a blank line between the last line of the header and the first line of
text.  I tried that, and successfully launched three posts.

I'll call off the troops.

Mike,

Sorry about the very slow response.  The reason that this "feature" was 
removed is that it was unexpected bahavior that was causing frustration 
for novice users.  A workaround is to export the first message to a file, 
then read it into the reply.  To improve upon this, a future version of 
Pine will allow you to mark several messages and reply to all of them as 
a group, including all the messages in the reply!

Thanks for the report!

I do hope that when you fix things so you can post to news from within
Pine you will force the required empty line between the headers and the body!
That is the number two problem just behind the IBM nonsense of putting
spaces in lines that are supposed to be empty.

Unfortunately, Pnews places the cursor at the top of the file.  I would
imagine it could be hacked to drop down to the last line and do the
required magic.  In the meantime, it's all auto-manual.

Just to clarify a little. When executing pico from Pnews, it is simply acting
as a text editor.  It has absolutely no idea that anything but plain text. 
When called from Pine, it is passed a pre-constructed envelope and a text
body.  When you are editing the headers, Pico constructs the envelope.  When
full news posting support is added, all the news headers will be included in
the envelope.  And, yes, the blank line will be there ;)

Alright, I posted some pico dreams yesterday, and nobody has yet replied, 
but here is a pine dream I have.

MULTIPLE IN BASKETS
	As I'm sure many others do, I use the filter program to sort through
	all of the mail I get (I get far too much for any rational human 
	being, I think).  The problem is, Pine only keeps tabs on the 
	mail in INBOX, never letting you know if something comes in and
	is shunted to another folder.

	If there was a way to define a list of folders to keep tabs on 
	and then inform you when mail arrives in that specific folder, 
	that would be most nice.

	As for checking on starting up pine, perhaps present a menu with 
	a listing of all the folders with new mail, and then you choose
	where to go, with the default being INBOX, of cours.

Just a thought.

I may be mistaken, but I believe the incoming-folders option in pine 3.85 
and greater does what you want.

>From my .pinerc:

# incoming-folders are those other than INBOX that receive new messages.
# Folder syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}folder-path
# Use only if you filter incoming email into multiple files or receive

Sorry about that folks.  Too many damn maining lists, I guess, and not

Robert,
Some of these are already on the enhancement list; I'll make sure they 
all get considered.

Mike,
The "incoming message folders" mechanism represents the *beginning* of what 
Robert wants, but we still have more to do.

The plan is to extend the "magic" TAB command to move you from INBOX to the 
other Incoming msg folders you have defined.  Initially, it will do this 
blindly, without knowing if there is any new mail in that folder or not.

Once the IMAP2bis spec is nailed down, we hope we will have the needed 
mechanism for determining efficiently whether or not a folder has unread 
mail.  Then TAB will either skip the folders lacking unread messages, or 
at least indicate whether there is unread mail pending.

The question of keeping all incoming folders open and monitoring for new 
mail is tough for a couple of reasons, including efficiency/performance, 
and user-interface complexity.  (How do you indicate *which* folder has 
received new mail, without overloading the message line?)

Anyway, we'll start with the TAB-initiated jump to other incoming 
folders, and see how that goes.  (Tab will also be used for moving 
through newsgroups, beginning with 3.88.  This will happen when you hit 
Tab and there are no other unread messages in the current folder.)

While folks are dreaming about new features for pine, a colleague
stated that he would like to see pine be able to mail a message
from the command line.  An example would be something like this:

    % pine -s '_subject_' _user_ < _message_

Is there a possibility that this can be considered for a future
version?

If you are using a *nix host, there is a shell based solution that
might meet your needs.  In csh or tcsh one would just 'set mail'
appropriately.  Here is an excerpt from our local csh man page:

     mail	    The files where the shell checks for mail.
		    This is done after each command completion
		    that results in a prompt, if a specified
		    interval has elapsed.  The shell says You
		    have new mail, if the file exists with an
		    access time not greater than its modify time.

		    ...

		    If multiple mail files are specified, then
		    the shell says New mail in _name_ when there is
		    mail in the file _name_.

In sh or ksh, setting the MAILPATH variable should have the same
effect.

> . . . A workaround is to export the first message to a file, . . .

	Speaking of this:  is it possible when composing a message in the 
pine composer easily to save that message in a file and return to it later.
	I know there is the postpone feature--and that is very handy--but 
it is limited.  I have situations in which I start to write to someone, 
get a good letter going, but then decide I want to wait (for more 
information, for a cooler moment, whatever) before deciding whether to 
send it.  If I simply postpone it, then I'm stuck answering "no"-- 
possibly for weeks--whenever I use the composer, and not being able to 
postpone any other messages in the meantime (or so I believe--correct me 
if I'm wrong).
	What I'd like is a "write to file" command in the pine editor.  I
*think* there is not currently such a feature.  Again, correct me if I'm
wrong. 
	I'm sure there are work arounds--e.g., use the postpone feature,
find the file that is saved as a result, and copy that file to a filename
of my choice.  Another work around would be to change the header to send
the mail to myself, send it, and then export it from my INBOX.  But maybe
there could be a more straightforward way?  I haven't tried slipping into 
an "alternate editor" (e.g. emacs or even pico) and saving from there.
	If I'm unusual in wanting this "write out" feature, then, since
there are work arounds, there is no point in adding it.  But maybe there 
is a more widespread interest in such a feature in an easy to use manner.
	I know--no more free control keys.  Is it time to add an extra 
layer of command keys--you know, using one control key as an emacs-like 
"prefix."  Complicates things, I know.
	By the way, David, thanks for your quick and clear responses to
everything.

We have a set of Course Notes, recently updated to be applicable to 
version 3.8* of Pine. The document has been produced using Interleaf, and
contains screen displays (but these are text, not screen dumps). I can 
supply a hard copy, a PostScript file, the Interleaf file, an rtf version
(produced by Interleaf, readable by Word), and a plain text version to
anyone who wants one.

The files are available via ftp to deneb.dur.ac.uk, in the directory
pub/Documents/Pine. The Interleaf files are in a subdirectory of Pine, called
Interleaf.

This question come up every once in a while.  But, I don't really see the
difference between that and

	% mail -s '_subject_' _user_ < _message_

About the only thing I see missing is the ability to specify a nickname
from your addressbook...

Another advantage to this, Dave, would be to send an attachment from the 
command line, which is something I've often wanted to do.

Perhaps:

% pine -s '_subject_' -f _file.name_ _user_ < _message_

I know that this is a religous issue, etc, but I can't see the reason for
having pine do command line mailing except for having it interpret address
book entries.  Why not just use an existing mail user agent for this,
such as mailx on Sys V or Mail on BSD?  

I am starting to get really worried about the creeping featurism of Pine. I
adopted it here because it was so simple and easy to use, that it didn't
scare away novices.

Thankfully, the feature-sets are my salvation. It hides stuff from the
beginner until they are ready to use it.  As for setting this stuff within
Pine, if they can't edit an external file from the shell, they aren't ready
for more features!

A number of awkward work-arounds have been suggested for this
functionality.  This solution works well for me: 

  - delete all the recipients.
  - set Fcc: postponed
  - "send" the message (no recipients, only a file copy)

...so there is folder named "postponed", containing one or more messages.
Later, when you want to resume composing...

  - enter the "postponed" folder.
  - forward the messages (not as MIME, to continue composing).

Hint

If recipient addresses are complex, and not in the address book, then
"undelete" them into the message body as you delete them from the headers,
and reverse the process later when you are editing the forwarded message. 

Why this is good

 - It's file system independent, and works the same way on any platform. 
 - It keeps mail in mail folders, where mail belongs, IMHO.
 - Location independence (it should work fine with IMAP).

Even if the composer allowed saves, addresses are still a problem. A more
elaborate solution would be a special (to Pine) "postponed" folder, where
such messages would be squirreled away, and the only operation would be
"resume composing".  The down side of this is complexity.  Consider the
novice who accidentally postpones a message -- the way it works now, it's
impossible to forget about postponed messages.  This is worth keeping.

We have an item on our requested enhancements list to add support for 
multiple postponed messages.  Beyond that, I think you have pretty well 
enumerated the workarounds.  I can think of another workaround that will 
be available when we get the bounce command implemented as well...

That ability, to use your addressbook names, it sorely needed, for 
mailing to large distributions or the like.

Bob,
Interesting that you use (reply or forward? you didn't mention which) 
the Fcc: line only to postpone, ie to save to a folder.

Yesterday I had a complaint from a user who used "F"orward, deleted the 
addresses and used Fcc just to save to another folder.  (The person had 
found this technique, but not a simple "S"ave.)  The problem is that only 
the From line in the mail header was getting saved, not the message.

Since the person claimed that this had worked in the past, I'm guessing 
that it might be a problem with 3.87.  The problem was reported on a 
Sequent Dynix/ptx system and I duplicated it on Ultrix.

The bottom line is:  check to make sure this is still working for you!!

(I'm presuming David Miller will see this and get it to pine-bugs if 
appropriate.)

so why not drop news reading from Pine then? we have news readers for 
that :-)
I would like to be able to do a 'sendfile report1.wpf user@foo.edu'
where 'sendfile' would be a script that would invoke Pine and tell it
to mail to foo with an attachment that pine would mime encode.
but, thats just me....I'll probably always use tin or rn for news...

Subject: Re: Command line mailing?

Perhaps the best way to handle the "creeping featurism" issue in Pine
is to adopt the unix ideal of small tools working together, especially
where the command-line is at issue.  A small tool to pull RFC822
addresses from the address book could work like this (with /bin/sh):

	mail -s "_subject_" `pineaddr _nickname_` <_message_

Another utility might be written to MIME-encode attachments:

	mimify _message_  _file1_  _file2_ | mail -s "_subject_" _addr_

or, if MIME  requires those MIME-specific headers in the message
(haven't paid that much attention):

	mimify -s "_subject_" -a "_addr_list_"  _message_  _file1_  _file2_

where "mimify" would create the necessary headers & encapsulations and
pipe it off to sendmail (or MTA of choice); not too sophisticated a
task.  It could borrow existing code from Pine, but not be a part of a
monolithic do-all, be-all.  (Of course, "`pineaddr _user_`" could be used
instead of "_addr_" and "_addr_list_" in the preceeding examples.)

Remember that Pine is most notable for its user interface; we have
technically-sophisticated users abandoning mailtool & xmail in favor of
it, and not because of MIME.  These command-line issues really are not
at all related to Pine as a user interface.  Stand-alone, simplish
command-line utilities are best for command-line usage.  The majority
of Pine users will never need something like this, so why burden Pine
with it (and introduce new bugs with the effort)?  The "pineaddr" and
"mimify" utilities could be included in the Pine distribution, if the
UW guys decide they want to support it.  But it really doesn't need to
have anything to do with Pine proper.

Subject: unhiding "sender" header field in attached message

I asked this once, but got no answer, so I'll try again.

Reading a message in pine that contains an attached message, the sender
header is hidden. How can I tell pine to display the sender header in the
attached message?

I'm using 3.87.

Thanks!

	I have such a tool.   But it doesn't use Pine, 
so it doesn't exploit Pine's addressbooks.   But it could. 
I intend for my tool to rely on some other (as yet undetermined) 
program to "explode" lists and translate aliases.   If this 
other tool could use Pine's addressbooks,  so much the better!

Frank,

It looks like you are being bitten by the notorious NFS file locking
problem.  Our recommended solution is to install an IMAP server (imapd) on
the system(s) that has the local storage.  This way the IMAP server can
manage all of the locks locally without having to worry about rpc.lockd
bugs.  We are working on ways to bypass the NFS locking problems, but do
not have a completely satisfactory solution yet. 

Thanks for the report!

Guenter,

I had not seen this before on other AIX 3.2.x systems.  Unfortunately 
there seems to be some variation among AIX 3.2.x systems that does not 
necessarily correspond with the version number...

Thanks for the contribution!

What utility are you using to post?  I haven't had any problem
using plain "pico" or "pico -t" to post from nn - I just did some
experiments on articles with long header lines.  I'm using
Pico 2.1 which I think is the latest.

Thanks,
Nancy

Christer,

Sorry about the delayed reply.  The character mapping was a desparately
needed last minute enhancement added to PC-Pine.  As we get more
experience with it, we will decide when/how/if we want to add further
character set translation to Unix Pine.  I am also not sure how well 
ISO-646-SE terminals will work with Pine, since Pine relies on "{}|[]" 
for context management and such.  Of course, this is not usually of 
concern to novice users and I assume that power users know how to bypass 
the problem...

Thanks for the suggestion!

Dave,

There are much better ways to work around the sendmail buffering bug than
the hack to not expand local addresses.  Pine 3.88 solves this by breaking
the list into pieces that are more palatable to sendmail.  It should be
available in a few days. 

Thanks for the report!

I'm wondering if there are any immediate/future plans to implement the 
ability within pine to manipulate folders that are compressed.  I know 
that I have about 500 to 1000k in various and sundry folders, and if I 
could compress them, it sure would be a boon on my quota limited system.

Thanks :)

Isaias,

There are some other things you can look at that should improve performance
more than just locking Pine resident.  If you normally keep alot of messages
in your inbox, you can probably get a considerable speedup by switching to a
Tenex format INBOX.  You can convert your inbox to Tenex format by creating
an empty file called "mail.TxT" in your home directory.  Note that other 
mail programs will not be able to read the Tenex inbox.

Robert,

You are not the first to suggest this, and it is on the ever-growing
"requested enhancement list".  Can't make any promises yet, though.

Robert,

We have no plans to implement compressed folders.  However, it should not 
be very difficult to implement a c-client driver to implement compressed 
folders.  See the c-client/mbox.c file in the Pine distribution for an 
example of how to write a driver that inherits most of it's code from 
another driver.

It happened to me again, I answered No, when I meant to return to editing
and lost everything!  But this time I stopped to think about why I 
unconsciously repeated this same stupid mistake when I know better.

I am usually in a hurry, and subconsciously saw the word "leaving" right 
next to Y/N and *THAT* word stuck in my mind, therefore since I didn't
want to "leave" I answered N.

Perhaps it could be reworded as....

Before leaving, would you like to save? (Y/N)

Then the key word "save" is right near where the action is to take place
and where the eye's focus is, and that is the location of the cursor.

I think I can manage this code change locally :-), but thought I'd toss 
it out for consideration as well...

Can I reply to my own post?! :-)

Just realized more... the behavior of pico and pine are different in this
respect, and that may be what throws me off time and time again. In pine,
if I hit ^X it asks me if I want to send the message. If I say N then I
return to editing. I have to press ^C to cancel. In pico if I answer N
I exit the program.

So the inconsistency is the problem.  Don't know the solution. Some 
companies spend big bucks studying user interface design issues so I'll
leave suggestions to others! My job is to just whine!

We have plans to implement a new (hopefully) generic driver that exhibits
characteristics: 

(1) Hierarchical folder structure mapped onto the hierarchical folder
    system.   If the host systems does not support hierarchy, then we
    will have a variant that just uses filesystem namespace encoding 
    to emulate hierarchy.

(2) Per-file store of messages.   This should allow individual messages 
    to be locked.

(3) Message compression.  Messages will be stored compressed.

This new driver will converge with similar local transport support 
developed for our MTA's that will allow the MTA to write into the 
folder space, do cross linking of messages on delivery and write
compressed files.   It will also provide an API for managing message
archival on the system.

We see this as being very important for providing mail service 
independent of the UNIX server host environment.   Theoretically, the 
IMAP server will use Kerberos for authentications and production rules 
based on the Kerberos user information to locate and identify user folder 
spaces.  Deployment of remote mail systems in large sites is dependent 
on MS/MTA convergence support to support large organization mail 
administration.

Plans for providing this new folder structure are to begin implementation 
in January.   We are busy acquiring additional resources for making this
happen.  We will of course make this available to the Pine development 
team if they don't do something first.

Cheers.

PINE here runs on a lightly loaded DS5000/240 under ULTRIX. 
Intermittently, we notice long delays in receiving mail. For example last 
week I sent a short message to the next cubicle at 8:30 am, it arrived as 
new mail at 4:00.  Most of our 40 users have access to v3.07, a few of 
us are using 3.87. Can someone give a suggestion on how to 
diagnose/remedy this?  Will upgrading to the current version help?

The problem is you have just initiated an 'exit' procedure,
and the 'no' response should abort the exit procedure
(and return you to the edit mode).
There is no reason it should be impossible to abort the exit function,
an accidental ^X should be abortable.  -mr

  Hi David,
	I don't think that PINE is the originator of this, I think in 
other causes, for example :

- Recipient/Sent system is very busy with other programs.
- Problem of Network (neck of bottle)

	Check you "syslog" file for messages "queued" and you can to 
reduce this increase the privilege for /usr/lib/sendmail...

Isa.

At present the mail spool directory on each cluster server is NFS mounted 
to the rest of the machines in that group. Everyone's login script runs 
the elm "frm" command to list the messages in their inbox on login.

As we move to using an imap-based mail system (with pine and ECS) it 
would be nice to have an imap-based version of the "frm" program - a _small_ 
program that just lists the inbox and exits.

Regards

Laurie Cuthbert

Laurie,

Yes, it would be nice to have c-client based frm, filter, biff, xbiff, ...

We will work on them as resources permit, but they would be fairly easy
introductions to c-client programming.  If anyone is interested, let us know
and we will reserve it for you :)

please accept my apologies.

We are using Pine 3.87 on a Sun SPARC 10/30 running SunOS 4.1.3. I have 
found repeatedly, that deleting and expunging a single message from my 
inbox, leads to a core dump. The error message is as follows:

	Bug in Pine detected: "Bad msgno in 
	mail_fetchstructure". Exiting pine.
	Floating exception (core dumped)

Are others experiencing this? If so, are there plans to rectify this 
small problem in Pine 3.88?

Ian.

Ian,

We believe that we have fixed all occurances of the "Bad msgno in
mail_fetchstructure" crash in Pine 3.88, which is *very* close to release. 

Thanks for the report!

Hi -- 

All of sudden (I know, yeah right!!!) I get the following message when I 
start up pine (ultrix v 4.2  pine v 3.87)

error saving ..../.pinerc - cross device link

My home directory is on another machine, but it's been that way forever.  

what's it mean?

Paul,

When Pine updates the .pinerc file, it writes a new one then 
deletes the old one and renames the new one.  It will first attempt to 
write the new tempfile in the same directory as the old .pinerc.  If that 
fails, it will try /usr/tmp then /tmp.  Therefore, if the directory your 
.pinerc is in (usually your home directory) is unwritable for some 
reason, you will get the "cross device link" message.

I hope this helps!

Is there any way I can disable the second confirmation when I save a 
message from one folder to another?  For example, I move my completed 
tasks from my main inbox to a folder called "projects", so I type "s" 
from index to save the message, then ^T to get a list of the folders, I 
select "projects" and hit return, then it brings up a line that I have to 
hit return again on to actually have it save the message.  Is there any 
way to have it just save the message in the folder and not have to hit 
return again?(like it was in 3.05)

Is there any reason that the pine news indexer doesnt convert the
date in news articles to local time zones?

Is it a configuration problem or can pine not deal with time zones?




Thanks,

I'd like a simple way to invoke spell -b  to use the British spelling .
I'm not very technical and we are still on pine 3.07 so perhaps something
has been done already or is on the cards . Is there a simple way to do
this already ? I figure the spell.c file in pico is where the change needs
to be made .

Muriel,

You can do this very easily by setting the SPELL environment variable 
before entering Pine.  If you are running csh, the command is

	setenv SPELL "spell -b"

	Try adding this to your .profile or .login:

SPELL="spell -b "
export SPELL

	That ought to work.
	(I'm not an expert on this stuff, so if I'm wrong, just send me 
back to my philosophy books.)

Michael,

This is a suggestion that has come up a couple times lately.  We will put 
it on the list of requested enhancements as a feature-list option.

Thanks for the suggestion!

X-Owner:    pine-announce-request@cac.washington.edu
X-To:       Pine Announcement Distribution <pine-announce@cac.washington.edu>

For the most part, Pine 3.88 is a maintenance release that fixes a number
of bugs ranging from the merely annoying to the truly nasty.  An overview
of the fix list is included below, and an itemized list can be found in
the distribution's release notes.  If this is the first version run since
3.0x, it's probably a good idea to read the release notes to see what's
changed since 3.07 as well. 

The distribution is available via ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
file "mail/pine.tar.Z".  PC-Pine can also be retrieved via the "Setup" 
command's "Update" option. 

As always, many thanks to all who have taken the time to provide valuable
feedback and bug reports.  Thanks for the help! 

The Pine Team



SUMMARY OF 3.88 CHANGES:

- Fixed: A nasty bug causing Pine to go into an infinite loop if it
  received a "Hang Up" signal while in the composer.

- Fixed: At least some (maybe even all!) causes of crashes associated
  with the message "Bad msgno in mail_fetchstructure".

- Fixed: Several other bugs leading to Pine crashes.

- Fixed: About 65 other less severe bugs.

- Changed: several MIME encoding rules.  Inline text should be encoded
  less often, and hardly ever in Base64.  (More than 30% of the characters
  would need to be 8-bit in order to trigger Base64 encoding.)  Also,
  all IMAGE types, including TIFF, are now passed to the external viewer,
  if one is defined.

- Changed: default folder name for Goto.  Now you are never more than
  two keystrokes away from your INBOX.

- Changed: Method for moving to next news group.  Used to be "D" or "N"
  on the last message would prompt for the next newsgroup.  Now TAB does
  this "magic" function, and it also works in INBOX if you have multiple
  Incoming Message Folders defined.

- Changed: the interval for checking new mail has been increased from
  0.5 min to 2.5 min in order to reduce Pine's resource use.  The
  checkpointing algorithm is also smarter about when to checkpoint.

- Changed "(y/n)" prompt string to "(y/n/^C)" to make visible the fact
  that the operation can be cancelled via Control-C.

- Added: new prompt in Keyboard Lock to allow confirmation or escape after
  entering a password.

- Added: ability to enter control characters as ESCAPE ESCAPE <character>
  as a workaround for terminal servers and communication programs that
  gobble up certain control characters.

- There are also a few fixes to Pico and IMAPd in this release.

Note to Sequent PTX 1.X users:  if you are experiencing performance
 problems, make sure you get the new patch from Sequent to make "fsync"
 work like all other Unix "fsync"s instead of just doing a "sync" instead!

Several folks have asked for pre-compiled versions of IMAPd in addition 
to Pine and Pico.

This has been done, but as a consequence the /mail directory got awfully 
long, so we've moved all of the Unix binaries to /mail/UNIX-BINARIES/
and the PC-Pine .zip files are now in /mail/PC-PINE/

The complete source distribution is still in /mail/pine.tar.Z

Muriel, here's a KornShell specific solution.
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

typeset -x SPELL='spell -b'

This sets the environment variable and exports it to "child" shells.

If you use the KornShell exclusively on your system and you want to 
ensure that the British spelling option is always used you can put:

typeset -x SPELL='spell -b'

In /etc/profile.

Greetings:-

I just tried to pick up some AIX 3.2 and Sun binaries from 

	pine.cac.washington.edu:/pine/unix-binaries

and

	pine.cac.washington.edu:/pine/UNIX-BINARIES

but was unable to as permission was denied. I was wondering if you folks 
could fix up the permissions on the files in this directory.

Thanks,

Ian.

Ian,
As far as I can tell, the protections are OK, and here is a line from
the transfer log indicating that a successful transfer has occurred:

Thu Nov 25 01:02:21 50 gatekeeper.dec.com 3858030 
  /mail/UNIX-BINARIES/pine-bin.aix32

Note that the lower-case version of the directory is abbreviated: unix-bin
(It is a symbolic link to UNIX-BINARIES, just as /pine is a symbolic link
to /mail)

Please try it again and let us know what happens...

Major apologies: There seems to have been some problems associated with 
the host that I was using for ftp! I have successfully ftp'd several 
binaries now. Sorry for the red herring !

Please can anyone tell me how to print multiple messages easily
e.g to print messages 21 to 35 is there "something" that can do
21-35Y or 21-35L depending on which version of pine is being run,
or "something" like 15Y or 15L which will print 15 consecutive
messages starting at the current message- in this case 21 ?

If there is such a feature can it be used with the save command ?

This little niggle has now caught me three or four times, so I thought it 
worth reporting.

I had no immediate reservations when you changed the "print" keystroke to 
"Y", but I have now discovered why it might have been a bad idea. I am an 
"old growth" user, and my fingers get into habits. For example, when I want 
to expunge the deleted messages from a folder, I type XY without thinking 
and without pausing. 

On several occasions recently I have either mistyped, or keystrokes have 
got lost, or something, with the effect that a Y keystroke ends up 
reaching Pine unexpectedly. On at least two occasions I haven't noticed 
what it was prompting for**, or else this keyboard has played its trick of 
repeating characters, so that I have actually produced unwanted pieces of 
paper.

I'm sure there is nothing you can do about this, but if ever I write a 
program that relies on Y/N prompting, I shall make sure there is no command 
called Y :-)

This is a small point, however! We appreciate the good work you are doing 
on Pine.

Regards,
Philip


** I do find a lot of the prompts non-useful, and habit makes me reply Y to 
pretty well anything without thinking. Bad habit, I know, but I suspect a 
lot of frequent users act the same. It would be nice to be able to turn 
them off selectively. Then I might pay attention when one did appear...

Philip,
For what it's worth:

 -In retrospect, I agree that "Y" was a bad choice --one for which I 
  must take most of the blame.

 -You're right, it is probably impossible to change it now, unless there
  is a huge groundswell of support for the idea.

K.M.,
This is a feature we call "aggregate operations", and it will be coming
to Pine in '94 in the form of the "Apply" command.  (It will apply print, 
save, and most anything else we can think of, to a selection or range of 
messages.)

I'd vote for something else. Our users are still on 3.07 but my staff have
commented on the non-intuitive nature of Y (L->laser,lineprinter, etc) and
question the need for a change. Pine has been a roaring succcess here
because of its low-hassle characteristics - changing the method of
performing a key operation is not going to win us any credit.

This change is one of the reasons that we're stalling on releasing 3.8x
until we can redo docs, course notes, etc. 

Perhaps ^something; you have ctrl sequences in pico but not in most of the
dialogue screens so you'd be more or less free to choose what you want.

Why use L for folder list and not ^F; people have to use ^P/^N to switch
folder collections.

Mike,
This is exactly why changing it *again* would be so problematic!

We've tried *very* hard to limit use of control characters to pico, or
other places where you are at a prompt requiring text input.  

Some of the control keys for navigation may also be used as an *alternative*
outside pico, e.g. ^P/^N, ^Y/^V...)
 
> Why use L for folder list and not ^F; people have to use ^P/^N to switch

Again, we'd like to avoid *forcing* the use of control keys outside of
text-input situations.  (We already get enough flack from those who prefer
modal editors, e.g. vi, and consider it a mistake to use *any* control
characters.)

The theory behind ^P/^N is that they are supposed to be, in all cases,
synonyms for up-arrow and down-arrow.  However, I recently noticed that 
the arrow keys on my X terminal don't work to select prev/next collection.
That's a bug.

I believe the decsion to change L to list folders was correct; it is a
very important screen and one that we needed to make more pervasively and
easily accessible throughout Pine.  But Print is also important, hence the
dilemma. 

We will keep considering options; additional feedback on whether to even
consider making yet another key change would be appreciated.

I agree with those folks who are saying that the choice is a bad one.  It
would be a good idea to change it to something better.  And I favor
changing it back to L for print.

I understand the dilema you face, however, I think that if a change is
going to be made to the print key it should be done as quickly as possible
before to many people get used to the new assignment. Here we are not
going production 3.88 until January to give people a chance to test
the new software and become accustomed to the keys. There has been a
lot of praise (well deserved) and only one complaint..you guessed it,
people accidentally printing files because the status messages now
have a delay so that most people "type ahead" :-)

                      ^     ^^^^^

But L for Print is just as unintuitive as Y for Print.  I think the user
will get used to either (just as I have become used to Y).

I think the BEST choice (the most intuitive at least) would, of course,
be P for Print.  However, with N for Next Msg, P for Previous Msg seems
a better choice.

It's cliche, but "you can't please everyone".  I certainly don't envy
you Pine developers.  [maybe we need a new alphabet with more letters :)
or we should all learn a different language, where ther are less
abiquities between things like Print, Previous, List, LinePrinter etc :) ]

I too encounter the `accidental' XY problem, typing ahead in an 
attempt to expunge and confirm the expunging, when not in Index mode.

But this isn't a problem with Y being print; just that, for some reason,
X doesn't work in Index mode; for example, when having just read and 
deleted a message.  (Could it not?)

  I.

I'm afraid that I'm going to have to agree with this one.  Yes, "Y" is 
not very intuitive for print.  However, I have found that being able to 
navigate through my folders to be much more important.  I like very much 
the inclusion of the "L" command.  I'm also not very worried about our 
users being confused by it, particularly considering that the handy menu 
is right at the bottom of their screen.  As long as the menu is there, I 
don't see it likely to be an issue, at least not here.

Hi
Has anyone had any success with 3.88 on an SGI running Irix 5.X

The _tzname in os_sgi.c (or was it os_dep) seems to need changing to 
tzname and <time.h> rather than <sys/time.h> to get it to compile. 
However although pico builds pine coredumps as soon as it is started up 
leaving the terminal without a carriage return (just echoes ^M).
Anyone know what I could do to either fix pine or reset the terminal as I 
have to login from another line in order to kill the old one at present.

It builds ok under 4.05 and on a HP running 9.01 and I have not found any 
bugs yet.

Thanks
Neil

Funny, neither prynt nor save are right there on my screen. Luckily I'm not

More importantly, people have already absorbed the earlier key. People, 
especially novices, don't like systems to change under their feet.

I was very happy with G for "Goto folders"; putting G onto the Main Menu
in place of F would have produced the consistency sought without
introducing the Y problems.

Unfortunately, there seem to be multiple, incompatible versions of SGI.

Try replacing the IMAP toolkit (the entire imap/ subtree) in the Pine
distribution with the latest experimental version from mail/imap-3.2.tar.Z (on
ftp.cac.washington.edu) and see if that builds/work any better.

I also think that L is better as 'print-screen' than Y. We also are still
running 3.07. I have several people locally trying out 3.8x and have had
several complaints about changing print.

David

As we have a need for a c-client based frm, we'll do it. At least, Andy 
Martin (A.P.Martin@qmw.ac.uk) will do it (I approve of delegation!).

It seems fairly straightforward, the only bit I think we need to be 
careful about is to ensure it does not seize the lock - if someone has 
pine open in one window and then opens a second we don't want them to 
lose the lock from the first just becuase of a second login.

Regards

Laurie

When typing a local name on an outgoing message, pine sensibly 
addes the domain name

But when it received a message stamped with a local name only, it adds 
the HOST name, not the domain name. e.g.:

I can't see any obvious way to change this.

Obviously, if all MUAs generated properly qualified names, this would not 
be a problem, but they don't!

The thing to be sure of is that you set the OP_READONLY flag in the 
mail_open() call in your frm clone program.  If you do this, it will 
never grab the lock away from Pine.

Laurie,
I'm not 100% sure I understand which scenario you are describing, so 
the following may be both old news and irrelevant, but just in case:  if
you set "user-domain=qmw.ac.uk" in your .pinerc, that should control what
goes in the From: line, (and in cases of unqualified destinations, the To:
line), regardless of what the host thinks its name is.

But if Pine sees an "@" in an outgoing address, it will not touch it.

Terry

Sorry if I haven't explained myself clearly. I appreciate pine will only 
qualify names without the "@" - and using the "user-domain=" configuration it 
correctly adds the domain to unqualified destinations and the From: line.

However, not everyone in the dept uses pine and some mailers just send mail 
with the To: and From: lines set to a user name with no "@". When pine reads 
these it adds @HOSTNAME, not @DOMAINNAME.

i.e. within the dept the domain is elec.qmw.ac.uk (it gets massaged by the 
site PP mailer on the way out) - if someone sends mail to me with /ucb/mail 
(or even Eudora) the To: line is just set to "laurie" and the From: line to 
"their_username". When pine reads the mail it changes this to 
To: laurie@osprey and From: their_username@osprey - it would better if it was 
to add something to add the domain name.

Regards

Laurie

My first attempt to use PC-PINE version 3.88 showed a serious bug, and I 
have now reverted to 3.87.
I am sending this to Pine-bugs as a bug report, and to Pine-info to ask 
(in a tone of surprise) whether other users have seen this effect, or 
whether they have not yet tried.
I am using the packet-driver version from pcpine_p.zip 

On entering Pine I try I to see my INBOX, which is OK, and then G to look 
at another folder (outbox as it happens); PINE puts 
Opening ""
in the information line. 
Not suprisingly, it does not find that folder, says 
No Folder, trying to get mailbox lock from process nnnnn, waits a bit 
(for the lock I suppose) and then says 
Folder "" opened with N messages (and it is actually the INBOX)

In the process of doing this, it also lost all my D flags.
I have backed off to 387!

A thought has come to mind on this matter.

Perhaps the pine team provided ListFldrs as a means to get to the folders
without having to use a control sequence, such as is necessary with Goto. 
If so, perhaps the Goto command could be slightly modified.  Instead of
immediately asking for a folder name, maybe provide a small menu that had
"regular" keys, such as "L" to ListFldrs.  To actually make a selection,
the "S" key (for Specify) would have to be pressed, though it could be the
default.  So, to get to the INBOX, one could press "G" for Goto, then
press RETURN twice instead of once.  It would add steps to the Goto
process, but it might mean that "L" could be used for Print as before. 

Pressing "G" for Goto could produce the following menu:

GOTO command:
? Help   P PrevFldr   L ListFldrs   E ExitGoto
         N NextFldr   S [Specify]  

Then pressing "S" or RETURN could yield:

GOTO folder in <Incoming Message Fol> [INBOX] :
^G Help        ^C Cancel
RETURN Enter   TAB Complete

Now, would the extra steps really be worth it????   While I like the 
convenience of having both the "G" and "L" commands as they are currently 
arranged, I can see that having both is almost redundant.

There isn't one at the moment, but [return] -> scroll-up-one-line
was very useful in 3.0x. It allowed a message to be scrolled line-by-line 
so that blocks of text could be copied/pasted between windows. In 3.8x we 
have to scroll a screenful up or down - less useful. I know you've run 
out of menu space, having this undocumented wouldn't be _so_ bad would it?

Mike,

Cursor up/down should scroll the message a line at a time...

   I have a need to allow one of the users to send e-mail from an
organization.  If the user's logon is smith and the organization is org, I
want to be able to have the from line read
       From:  The Organization <org@acad.csv.kutztown.edu>.  
I can have it read from "The Organization" but the from address is the
user's logon (<smith@acad.csv.kutztown.edu>).  I do not want to create a user
for the organization (we do not give "generic" accounts)y.  Is there a way to 
do what I want?

Lisa,

In the near future we will be adding support for a changeable Reply-To: 
header.  Will that take care of the problem for you?

I think that last is the key point. From the Message Index or Message Text
viewer, L[Enter] and G^T get you to a functionally similar place.  If G
replaced the new L, I think you'd get better continuity from 3.0x and lose
very little functionality, especially if a "C Collection-list" (taking you
to the current "FOLDER LIST" screen) was added to the "GOTO:SELECT 
FOLDER" screen that G^T gives you. 

L as used in 3.8x contributes little (Listing folders when you don't want
to Goto one of them??) and has displaced a command used by lots of novices
all the time (printing's very important to them, _they_ often feel safer
with hard copy).

Irrespective of the goodness or otherwise of Y for print, I think this is
a disastrous idea; the current behaviour of G is very ergonomic; adding 
an extra step in the sequence for getting between folders would be horrific!
 
In my view, for people who use folders seriously, GOTO is a fairly
frequent activity; I do not believe (and for the sake of the trees I hope
I'm right!) that people print half so often. Possibly a number of
relatively rare commands could be bundled together under "X" for eXtras,
with a subselection menu (in the same way as System has been done).

Jon,

A few causes of such crashes have been fixed in Pine 3.88.  If this 
problem still persists, could you please send us a stack trace from the 
core file, the users .pinerc, and any information on how to duplicate the 
problem?

Rich and Evengi,

We do not currently have complete support for either ISC or SCO in the 
Pine distribution.  A few people have reported success getting it to 
work, but I have not seen any patches yet.  We only distribute the source 
via our anonymous ftp site, ftp.cac.washington.edu, but I believe that 
UUNET maintains an automatic mirror of our distribution.  The current 
version is Pine3.88.

Thanks for your interest!

Pine people,

	In later versions of Pine, will there be an option to postpone 
several e-mail messages... or the option to save currently composing mail 
as an external file, with the option to read it back in at a later time 
to continue?

Is there anyway to use "w" to search the actual text in the email files.  
I understand that "w" will search the subject lines.


thanks.

Regarding ISC, I have sent patches in (to pine@cac.washington.edu) for
versions 3.87 and 3.88.  The bulk of the work is the inclusion of
nonexistent files for ISC, with the remainder being minor changes to the
distribution.  I regret to say that I am still finding bugs on this 
platform.

I have been asked to add a printer type to pine.  While looking
through the code, I found 2 instances of redraw_printer_select().
They appear to be essentially the same.  Are they both necessary?

Good catch!  The select_printer() and redraw_printer_select() in
pine/other.c are indeed redundant, unused and superfluous. 

Thanks for bringing this to our attention!  One has to wonder how it
slipped by us for this long...

Please note that the contents of these routines in pine/other.c
are better than those of pine/pine.c: in the other.c version the
System V-specific LPDEST and lp things are mentioned, while in
the pine.c version only BSD's PRINTER and lpr is listed.

I alread posted a patch for this to this mailing list months ago:

To: Pine Info <pine-info@cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Patch for Printer setup screen
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 93 17:32:42 MET
From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

In the file other.c and pine.c two functionally equivalent (static)
functions redraw_printer_select() exist.
The text included in other.c was more generic (it contained also references
to "lp" and "LPDEST", thus being more appropriate for System V systems).

So I made the following patch to make the text in pine.c equal to
that in other.c.

Please include this patch in the next official release.

I have just begun to use/learn Pine and support it on our systems here.
We have v3.07 running on a Convex, and I have recently installed v3.88
on a DECstation running Ultrix to check it out.

I have a question about distribution lists.  When you send a message to
a distribution list created in Pine, the received message shows all the
members of the list, instead of just the list name.  Is this something
that can be modified within Pine, or can you address the message in 
a particular way to prevent this from happening?  Or is this just a 
Unix/sendmail-ism?

Thank you!

Elaine,

If you put the list address on the "Bcc:" line instead of the "To:" or 
"Cc:" the recipients will not see the addresses.  To make this header 
visible, press ^R while editing the headers.

I hope this helps!

Steve,

Not yet.  This is something that may well happen as the underlying tools
become available in c-client and IMAP.  "w" will search the text of the index
line, including date, sender, size, etc.

I am not sure what you mean, but perhaps this information will help:

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file at
the same time.

Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on UNIX,
Pine implements all of them.  The result is a lot of complexity.

There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:

1) If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no other
   process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.

2) If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that no other
   process is accessing the mail file while you are writing it.

3) If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no other process
   can alter any of the internal contents of the mail file that you have read,
   but it is OK if another process appends new data to the mail file.

4) If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail file, you
   want to make sure that no other process has the mail file open.

There are several mechanisms of locking:

a) The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file, but with
   a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for /usr/spool/mail/isma is
   named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock).  This file accomplishes locks (1) and (2)
   above.  This is an exclusive lock.
b) The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file.  This accomplishes
   lock (1), and prevents lock (2).  Multiple processes can do this.
c) The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file.  This accomplishes
   lock (2), and prevents lock (1).  This is an exclusive lock.
d) The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp.  The file name used
   depends upon the version of Pine.  This accomplishes locks (3) and (4).
   This is an exclusive lock.

On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it used
instead of flock().  It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock file as
well, but this has not been directly verified.

Regards,

The fix I had in mind was to remove the redundancy, i.e. remove the
function from pine/pine.c, and change the other function from static to
global.

Hi! , 

I got one problem here.  I think it is a bug.  

I tried to attach a text file with email to my friends who don't use 
pine.  However, they couldn't read the text file if they used mail to 
read the email.  Is there any way to correct it?

Thanks for any suggestion!

Henry,

This is a common question.  We believe that an *attachment* should be 
guaranteed to arrive intact.  The only way to do that is to use BASE64 
encoding which comes across as gibberish to non-MIME mail readers.  If 
you want to send a text file to people who do not have MIME capable mail 
readers, use ^R to include it in the body of the message.

Sorry about the inconvenience!

Allan,

Pine does not yet support posting news.  We have an experimental version 
of Pine here that can post and we will be rolling those changes into the 
mainstream as soon as possible.

Thanks for the interest!

Henry,

The source for all versions is in pine.tar.Z.  There are pre-compiled
binaries for the various PC stacks in the /mail/PC-PINE directory.  There are
also pre-compiled Unix binaries for a few systems in /mail/UNIX-BINARIES.

That's OK: the function in other.c is the best one.
