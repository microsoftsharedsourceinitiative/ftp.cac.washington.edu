I wrote yesterday that I find myself using ^arrow keys in pico...

I also find myself using PgUp to try to get to the top of the index 
screen, but Pine tells me that I am already on the first page. I think 
PageUp should take you to the top of the page in this case. Again this is 
fairly standard for DOS applications.

Oh and similarly for Page Down of course!

We use Pine 3.89 on DYNIX/ptx 2.0.4 with no problems. 

Sequent recently told me that ptx version 4 will be released sometime in
Q1/Q2 of this year. I'm aware that ptx is a mjor Pine platform, and that
Pine runs on ptx at UW, but ... 

Could someone please advise if Pine will be ported to ptx version 4 when 
it is released?

Thanks,

Dave

If I leave PC Pine (3.89) running under MS Windows, when I return to it 
after a while I get the message [IMAP connection broken in reply]. 

Is this a bug?

I'm not sure what's happening - the 'in reply' bit of the error messsage
is a bit confusing (in reply to what?).

This sounds like a problem on your system; specifically, the system C include
file /usr/include/netdb.h is attempting to include /usr/include/sys/bitypes.h
but that file does not exist.

The netdb.h on our ULTRIX system does not reference bitypes.h, and I have no
idea what bitypes.h might be.  I looked on some of our other systems, and I
could not find bitypes.h there either.

At this point, I am inclined to say that the problem is a faulty installation
of the C compiler on your system.

Thanks, David - I find Pico VERY useful as a stand-alone editor for 
installation scripts etc. One other feature I'd like to see is a 
write-to-file operation (reverse of ^R). It would be useful in Pine for 
folks to make/modify/maintain their signature files (I just modified mine 
today and had to go out of Pine to do so - if I'd been able to mark the 
block and write it out I wouldn't have had to).

Greetings,
	I'm new to this maling list, but I have I problem that I thought 
that maybe someone could solve for me. Sorry if its been covered before.

	My e-mail address is edwards@teaching.physics.ox.ac.uk, but there 
are a quite a few places from which people have tried sending me mail, 
but have had it bounce due to `unknown domain', etc. I could live with 
that problem, because I have discovered that if I use my address as 
edwards%teaching.physics@ox.ac.uk, then it works from everywhere.

	I used to use Elm as my mailer, and this was fine because it got 
my return address, etc. correct, but I have now switched to Pine 3.89, 
and am experiencing problems. Pine uses the first form of my address.

	I have tried setting the user-domain=%teaching.physics@ox.ac.uk, 
but Pine puts a `@' inbetween the username and the domain when I post 
something locally (eg I input `user' and Pine completes it to 
`user@%teaching.physics@ox.ac.uk'.

	Has anyone got any idea how I could solve this? I don't know what 
it is putting in any of the Reply-To: headers or anything. Would it help 
if I mailed someone so that they could look to see what it is doing? 
Perhaps the next version of pine could have a variable that we can set 
which specifies the complete e-mail address of the user, so that it can 
be sent up manually if neccessary.

	Anyway, I would be very grateful if someone could help.

		Charuuba!

Now that we have moved student email in the department away from pop to 
imap-based mailers (mainly pine) we would like to be able to log when 
they have accessed the mailbox. This is purely so we can see which 
students have NOT read their mail for some time as it may be a warning 
that they are having some sort of problems and maybe dropping out - early 
warning can often solve the problem.

With pop we could do that by checking the date stamp on the lock file but 
there seems no obvious way with imapd. Have I missed something (obvious) ?

Regards

Laurie Cuthbert

David,

The next version of Pine will support the Reply-To: header and possibly a 
mechanism to modify the From: header.  Thanks for the request!

Since you're just interested in last access and not in any access telemetry,
have you considered using the file access time?

Another possibility is to modify the server_login() routine in imap/c-
client/os_???.c to write a timestamp of your choosing; that way, you'll be
able to discriminate inactive users specifically.

Without checking, I suspect you are hitting a UK problem here. I suspect 
that teaching.physics.ox.ac.uk is not registered in the NRS as a mail 
domain, but is  registered in the DNS. This will have the effect that 
anyone that mails to you directly using smtp will get the mail through; 
any mail that goes through "official gateways" will not.
The Reply-To: feature that is promised for later versions will "cure" the
 problem; alternatively, registering the teaching. etc in the NRS for 
mail (though oxford might have other objections to this).

On the assumption  that physics.ox is properly registered (and that you 
have a suitable mailbox there) you could get PINE to specify your mail 
address as edwards@physics.ox.ac.uk (and indeed you could leave your 
INBOX there as well).

Just check the access time on their mailbox file (for example, "ls -lu 
/var/spool/mail/user" if your mailboxes are located in /var/spool/mail).  
This is what finger does.

HI
It is a major headache for us all - the only way around it is to edit the 
sendmail.cf to force it to use %host.dept@ox.ac.uk when it generates a 
from: address 

AND
^^^
modify the pine send.c (?) to prevent pine generating a from: line.
(There are 2 sections of code which have to be def'd out).

The sendmail.cf mods are needed for all mailers unless the machine is 
registered outside the .ox.ac.uk domain. The pine mods are to prevent 
pine generating a valid from: line which passes straight through sendmail 
rules.

I have done this for SGI's and HP's here in materials and can offer 
limited advice.

Many people have switched back to using elm and PC/Mac Eudora until Pine 
comes up with a Reply-To: option.

Come on guys, hurry, hurry with the next release - just joking!!

Mark

Thanks for the response.

I should have explained in the original message that delivering mail with smail, the 
access time appears to be updated when mail is delivered as well as retrieved, so 
we can't use that.

I was hoping for any easy switch to cause to imapd to write info to syslog but we'll 
now have to investigate server_login().

Thanks

Laurie

Pity, since the % form of source routing is deprecated in the Internet.

	Is there any chance you can tell me exactly what I need to change to 
get my address working? Perhaps you could send me the relevent pieces of 
hacked source code/sendmail.cf files.

	If you could, I'd be very grateful...

Can anyone help with these questions?:

1. It's easy to get Pine's INBOX into tenex format by touch(ing) mail.TxT,
   but is there an easy way to reverse the process?

2. Is there a technical description of the tenex format so that I can 
   incorporate tenex support in a program I've written (specifically how
   to determine the start and end of a message, and its status: New, Old,
   or Unread). 

I'd like to make use of tenex but am wary about going up a one way street! 

Thanks in advance,


Dave

No, there is not currently a painless way to reverse the process.  A
simple copier program would be pretty trivial using c-client, but none of
us have gotten around to writing it.  I did talk to someone a few weeks
ago who was going to write such a beast, but have not heard anything in a
while. 

The Pine Technical Notes include a description of the Tenex format. The
easiest way to add Tenex support to your app would be to call the
appropriate c-client routines.  You might also want to wait for the Unix
MTX driver.  This is almost identical to Tenex format, but is binary
compatible with the MTX format used in PC-Pine. 

Thanks for the request!

When you exit pine, it seems to suck up all of the keystrokes from the 
time you hit expunge-yes until the prompt returns... Is there any way for 
pine to not suck up these keystrokes, so I can start typing the next 
command while it is exitting?  I've noticed this problem with other 
(SunOS 4.1.something) programs... Is it a general UNIXism?

I know this can be controversial, but I'd like the option of using 8-bit
characters (we use ISO 8859-1, here) in the header part of the message.=20
Our users are especially concerned because they can't use 8-bit characters
in the Subject field (=E4 and =F6 are very common letters in Finnish).=20

Could this option be included in a future version of Pine?  Perhaps as a
compile time option (-DALLOW_8BIT_IN_HEADER_ENTRY)?  Perhaps the header
fields where 8-bit chars are found could be quoted-printable-encoded?=20
Please.  I know this would break some rules but our users would be very
delighted.=20

Actually it's not that controversial, RFC1522 defines a way to represent
non-ASCII characters in headers.  Pine will support this eventually, but
probably not in the next release.

This message is a good example of how Pine has moved far away from it's
principle original design goal--KISS or, "Keep it simple, stupid."

The kinds of things Gregory would like to see are options in Mush, VM (almost
certainly) and probably several other mailers designed for power users.

I started using Pine because it was a solid mailer which did 70 percent of what
I wanted to do and did much of it well.  Yes, only 70 percent.  I always wanted
a score or so "enhancements."  However I knew that the sum total of all the
different enhancements which Pine users the world over wanted numbered a few
hundred.

I was happy to stick with a simple mailer because it could be used adequately
not only by me, but by all users of many different levels of understanding and
ability.  For the same reason our Computing Service here was happy to offer
Pine as our standard UNIX mailer.  We wanted to have something that was simple
to use, required no user configuration and which (one of early Pine's proud
boasts) didn't need paper documentation because it was so small.  Use of IMAP
and MIME were additional advantages which could simplify and enhance our mail
setup here but they were secondary.

Now creeping featurism threatens to swallow Pine whole.  The present
configuration file is a nightmare in some areas, and it continually grows.  One
may see some of the problems by the number of exchanges on this list which go:

    Q.	Why doesn't pine do "this?"

    A (several times.)  Just put "option77=blah" in your .pinerc file.

Pine is now complicated.

Don't misunderstand me.  There are some wonderful parts of Pine.  Pico is
pretty good and so are the supplied IMAP daemon and the c-client.  Indeed it is
because of these, Pine's solid base, that there is such a demand for Pine to do
even more.  I don't like this idea (although all my wished-for extra features
still aren't implemented :-)  Equally to the point I know that there are a lot
of people who are unhappy at Pine's current development.

I'm afraid that I don't have a definitive solution, but I will offer one
suggestion:

    Pine should be frozen at it's current state of development, or preferably a
    couple of states back, where the config file was simpler and there were no
    stubs for "coming" features visible to the user.

    This version of Pine can either retain the name, or become, say, "Pinelet."
    Perhaps someone out there can think of a suitable diminutive name.  The
    version we have now can then move on until it suits all us power users out
    here.  Only bug fixes would be back-grafted onto Pinelet.

What do you think?

(I have edited the commented original as it is getting v long).

I agree strongly with the KISS aim, though I dont arrive at the same 
conclusion  as Andrew, probably because my simple users still find it 
simple. 
My replies thus reflect that principle.

KISS says "please give the users information they understand; a 'random' 
large number tells them nothing (and since the count includes data in 
headers, it really *is* random). I personally see no reason for any data 
of this type, but if there has to be, line count sounds sensible to me 
(if well defined).

This one I cannot agree with; permitting implied separators causes chaos. 
Separation by commas is well understood even in plain English (apples, 
oranges, and pears).

Knowing that a lot of the coming features have been asked for by our 
users, especially features to make asynch use much more efficient (eg 
phone use) I cannot support this. I think the critical thing is to keep 
the simple subset clear (and simple!).

How about a menu-driven configuration built into pine with documentation
to explain what the various options mean.  To add spice have special
options in the global config file to stop users modifying their own
configs.  More work I know but it would make pine configuration much
simpler for the users.

I am new to this list, I use pine now instead of elm since several weeks
and I like it. In order to satisfy both "normal" users and power users I
would prefer to have a "User Level" command with options "beginner" and
"advanced" and in addition, to have the possibility to generate .pinerc
through a dialog.

Firstly pardon the severe edits - I'd done a more thorough job on this
reply and just got to the end, reformatted the last paragraph, and ... got
an error message about failing to allocate 144 bytes or something. Pine
could have snipped 144 chars from my message, I wouldn't have cared so
much - instead it just hung there 'till I gave the PC the 3-finger salute
and then I lost the lot :-(

Anyway, I quite agree with you about the config file - it is a nightmare!
- but I'd like to separate it from the other sort of enhancement request
you were actually replying to which was about "when a user does
<such-and-such action which users do> can Pine be made to treat it as a
correct thing to do instead of spitting it out as an error".  The example
was separating mail aliases by commas or spaces - other examples are
showing end-of-file messages when the end has been displayed instead of
when the user tries to page down, and the action of various PC cursor
keys. These sorts of enhancements do not require extra menu options or
setting in the config file, and can make Pine more instinctively natural
to use - user friendly - which I believe is the pine philosophy and A Good
Thing!=20

Anyway the *%=9C"@#! config file - I suggest:

(1) most straightforward options should be settable by the (promised)=20
Setup/Options screen, so the casual user should never have to edit their=20
.pinerc or (PC) PINERC file

(2) Pine should come 'out of the box' with a simple config file that can=20
be set by the Options function, and this file can either be expanded by=20
the user adding options manually, or by the user setting an=20
'intermediate' or 'advanced' user setting - in some way that the casual=20
user cannot do accidentally. Maybe by running pine from the command line=20
with some flag like:
=09PINE user_options=3Dintermediate [or advanced]
whereupon it would read the current config file and write out a new one=20
with extra bells and whistles.

(3) documentation! At present there is nothing between the 2-page Readme
file and the 180K tech notes (in some wierd MAN-page type of format) which
has to be FTPed over separateley. I suggest pine should come with some
intermediate level documentation which should explain what you can
configure, and give examples in more detail than in the config file
(indeed why have any in the config file - particularly in the PC version
where RAM is precious - if you can have decent documentation with it?) The
point is if you've got documentation you don't have to read it - and the
casual user won't - but if you haven't got it you can't!=20

(?) actually I think there could be a case for having two config files -
particularly in PC-PINE - one for the user's name, login id etc (which
the user could muck about with) and another for system-type settings (like
inbox-path=3D{imaphost.domain}inbox etc which are easier to screw up and
the casual user unlikely to need to deal with).

I'm very conscious that Pine is Washington's property - they made it -
they pay for it and so they're entitled to do what they like with it -
the rest of us are just free-loading.

However, I have to say that I agree wholeheartedly with Andrew on this. 
(Boring over here aren't we?) We chose Pine because it did most of the
things that most people wanted - painlessly. User support gets harder as
more arcane features/options are added. Instead of having 20 advisors who
know all about Pine 3.0x, we're unlikely to have more than 5 who'll get to
grips with all of Pine 3.8x. 

I do think that you should be conservative about adding features unless
they are geared to making life easier for Pine's original constituency. By
definition this list is for the people who setup/fix Pine, not its users -
contributions are unlikely to be representative of the user base. 

On the same reasoning it's the ever-growing Pine strand that should have 
a new name, not the "original". The original joke (PIne's Not Elm) is 
going to backfire when people start to say that Pine's Not Pine Anymore.

Hello Folks,
 Working on a SunOS 5.3 (Sol2) system, I want to keep a copy of all
mail I send out. This is easy to do with mail/mush: I add "set record= 
/home/labsha/mail/record" to my .mailrc. However, I have been having
some problems doing the same thing with pine 3.85. I have modified my 
.pinerc so that "default-fcc=/home/labsha/mail/record", and I have
come across some problems when I try to send mail from pine that
puzzle me. When I try to send mail I get the following message:

    Folder "/home/labsha/mail/record" doesn't exist.  Create? (y/n) [y]:

I get this whether or not ~/mail/record actually exists. If I say No:

    [Find of folder outside context: /home/labsha/mail/record]
    [Fcc of message rejected]

Pine doesn't send the message, and dumps me back in the compose screen. 
If I say Yes, and ~/mail/record exists, I get:

    [Can't create folder /home/labsha/mail/record: folder already exists]

Again, pine doesn't send the message, and dumps me back in the compose 
screen. If I say Yes and ~/mail/ record doesn't exist, I then get:

    [Find of folder outside context: /home/labsha/mail/record]
    [Message sent, and copied to "/home/labsha/mail/record".]

So, here are my problems:
1) Why can't pine seem to recognize ~/mail/record, even when it exists?
 a) Is it a problem with incompatible mail formats or something? I 
    wouldn't think so, cuz I can read the same mail file in mail, mush,
    and pine with no problem, but...?
 b) What does "out of context" mean within "Find of folder outside 
    context"? I get that when I try to get pine to recognize ~/mail/record 
    without creating a new file. This seems to be the real problem. Any 
    clues?
2) Why does rejecting the Fcc or inability to create ~/mail/record  mean 
   that pine cannot send the mail?

With the recent/ongoing thread about sent-mail as well as several recent 
system modifications, it occurred to me that this would be a perfect time
to ask Pine-Info and Answer-L. A couple of misc. related things:
1) I don't remember this happening before, so could it be related to the
   OS or the global pine setup (ie, related to whatever system changes
   have just happened)?
2) I would prefer that all my outgoing mail be in a single folder 
   (~/mail/record, if possible), but I suppose renaming it sent-mail
   should theoretically avoid all my current problems. Does anyone know
   a better way to approach my situation?

If someone could explain what pine is doing and why it is doing so, I 
would appreciate it. Also, if you know something better to do, please 
tell me.

thanx,
shy

Try setting "default-fcc=record".  Some versions of pine prior to 3.89 had
problems with fully qualified paths for the default-fcc.  Your problems
should also pretty well go away if you upgrade to Pine 3.89... 

Thanks for the report!

Andrew, Barry, Jack, Michael, Mike, John, et al:

Here are a few reactions and comments from one of the culprits...

> We wanted to have something that was simple to use, required no user
> configuration...

And it's still true that Pine *requires* no user configuration.  Erase
your .pinerc (and maybe even your pine.conf) and you can verify this for
yourself.  In fact, you'll see a Pine that looks remarkably similar to the
very earliest versions, except that it has more consistency across
screens. 

Even PC-Pine users never need edit their PINERC if they want a minimalist
Pine (or, as suggested, "pinelet").  That's because the first time they
run it, PC-Pine will prompt them for the configuration essentials (name,
imap server, smtp server). 

One of the reasons we have not made the "Pine Configuration" screen our
highest priority is that it has always been our view that the config
options were there primarily for those who were not intimidated by them.  

> Now creeping featurism threatens to swallow Pine whole.
> Pine is now complicated.

Note that some of you want the options to be *less* accessible, if not go
away altoghether, while others actually want them to be *more* accessible
(easier to configure.)  We won't talk about those of you who want lots 
*more* options, but you know who you are! :)

Remember, these creeping features that have swallowed Pine are indeed
*options*; those who do not explicitly turn them on, do not suffer any
added complexity. (Exception:  if the system admin turns them on in the
pine.conf, well... that's a local policy decision.  Also, the new status
indicators in the Index, + and A, are not configurable.)

> How about a menu-driven configuration built into pine with documentation
> to explain what the various options mean.

Planned.  But I suppose we need to make its presence configurable, in 
order to keep both the "no features" and "easier features" camps happy :)

> In order to satisfy both "normal" users and power users I would prefer
> to have a "User Level" command with options "beginner" and "advanced" 

Old timers will recall that we used to do just that:  there was a 
normal/basic mode and an "old-growth"/advanced mode.  However, we found 
that many options are a question of personal taste, and did not relate to 
experience level, so this model broke down.  There is still a novice 
mode, of course: it's what you get if you don't turn on any options!

> User support gets harder as more arcane features/options are added.

Could we get those 5 to help us with pine-bugs support? :)  

Mike's point is valid, of course, but on the other hand each site needs to
define it's own base configuration and level of support.  

Suppose that there was a "pinelet"... a base version that had no options. 
A user asks "How can I do xxx in Pinelet?"  The support staff says "Sorry,
it can't be done in Pinelet."  whereas the corresponding answer for
regular Pine might be: "Sorry, that feature is not available in the Pine
configuration supported at this site".  (Or they could say "RTFM"...)

But if folks really want a "pinelet", you can have it right now!  Just
have "pinelet" be an alias for "pine -p /usr/local/dummy.pinerc" and
presto. no personal pinerc and no user-settable options!  Just good-old,
simple Pine :)  (PC users wanting a "pinelet" must simply use some 
self-discipline and *pretend* they don't have a PINERC...)

> ... and which (one of early Pine's proud boasts) didn't need
> paper documentation because it was so small. 

Well, with Pine option configuration disabled as above, that's probably
still true, too!  (At least as true as it ever was...  documentation is a
funny thing.  Some people will use online but not hard-copy, some are just
the opposite, and the vast majority refuse to use either! :)

I don't think this is a good idea. There would be confusion between 
the two products, and one wouldn't be able to remember which did what.

We already have problems with the "novice" vs "old growth" modes in Pine.
Scenario:

A user phones up with a problem about the message. Adviser asks "What are 
the full headers?". User can't see all the headers, of course. Adviser says 
"press h to see the full headers". Users presses h. Nothing happens, 
because h is a "power user feature". A messy interchange follows.

I see no reason why Pine shouldn't have a number of configurable options, 
provided that the defaults are all suited for the novice, and there is an 
easy-to-use configuration screen with lots of explanation for each option, 
(a paragraph rather than a couple of words), so it is simple to make changes.

Users will advance as time progresses. Novices become power users in time. 
It's simpler if they can just start to use additional features of the same, 
familiar product.

Too bad. It would make Pine really shine. It's bit hard to explain to
someone named Bj=F6rn =E5sberg why he can use his name in the message
body, but not in the TO, FROM etc fields.

Apologies for yet another suggestion (which may have been made before),
but if "pine.conf" settings (when set) took precendence over ".pinerc" 
settings this would give sites an opportunity to setup Pine to suit their
user community. This would allow sites to: 

1.  Take advantage of new Pine releases (to overcome possible bugs).
2.  Control the release of new features to the user community.
3.  Block possibly undesireable features ("Update" and enable-suspend).
4.  Fix variables such as "user-domain", and possibly "news-server", etc.

If this approach was adopted, Pine would need to clearly inform the user
when a user configured option has been disabled if the user sets it in 
their .pinerc file.

As an example, I currently have the bounce and zoom commands disabled in
pine.conf to avoid user confusion, but will make them available when they
are implemented. 

Is the "pine.conf takes precedence over .pinerc" the perfect solution?

Nah, it's not so hard to explain. RFC822 was written in 1982. The
Atlantic Ocean wasn't discovered until 1991, and the Pacific Ocean a
year later. Latin America still hasn't been discovered, I think.

Hah,hah, only serious.

I must say I am impressed by the level of debate which has come about as a
result of my previous message.

To answer all the messages I have seen so far...

0.  I should have started off by thanking the UoW crew for giving us Pine at
    all.  I'd like to make amends by offering a VERY BIG THANKYOU here.

1.  I think that a reasonable config/preference screen would remove a lot of
    the problems with the present config file.

2.  The possibility that "Pine-out-of-the-box" should use a simple config
    file, with a "power-user option" to create and use a more complex one
    sounds attractive, but would clearly be considerable work.

3.  I shall definitely bear in mind the suggestion that "Pinelet" be something
    like "pine -p <simple config file>."

4.  I accept the argument that Pine and "Pinelet" should not be developed
    separately.

5.  The suggestion that pine.conf override .pinerc also sounds interesting,
    but there should be a .pinerc option to override the override!  Many
    mature UNIX programs do this sort of thing (UCB Mail, EMACS, nn, ...) but
    normally it is only a command-line option.  This a pain because it makes
    the user have his own wrapper when he hardly needs one.

6.  Documentation.  If a reasonable paper manual appears, it should hive off
    all the advanced options to a _very_ separate section.

Sounds to me like three levels are needed:

pine.conf  -  naive users standard defaults
.pinerc    -  upgrades for less naive users (settable by editor or online 
              config system) 
pine.absolute - local settings that cannot be over-ridden in any way

(and this does not make things more complicated for the simple users, but 
does allow the system managers to lock out things that they dont want 
experimented with or altered).

I dont' like it.

Admins I know are very paranoid.  As a matter of fact, when I installed 
filter and started sorting my mail into different subject-related 
mailboxes, I had to spend an hour explaining to the admin exactly what it 
was I was doing, and even then she only grudingly agree to allow me to do 
it because I get so much mail.

All it would take is an unapproachable and uninformed admin and users 
have all advanced options locked out, which turns around and makes pine 
useless.

I'd simply have it so that pine.conf is the default, and then users who 
know what they are doing modify their .pinerc for their specific needs.

Of course, since I'm not an admin, I'm just reporting on what I;d like as 
a user (and what I fear as a user).

Klaus -

Just to sensitize people to the problem, on my screen that name appeared=20
as: "Bj", a filled-in square, "n ", a Chinese character meaning a kind of=
=20
shell, and "berg".  My screen is set up with the Japanese character set.

Fortunately, Pine was able to recognize that it may not display the text=20
properly, and warned me of that fact (hey, it's better than refusing to=20
display it at all, which earlier versions did!).  However, it's important=
=20
to realize that all the world isn't ISO-8859.

Pine *will* support non-ASCII characters in headers, but you should=20
always have a reasonable 7-bit form of your name for the benefit of those=
=20
who can't display European characters.

make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `addrbook.o'

The errors about semantics aren't a problem near as I can tell; the 
c-client, pico, mtest, and imapd have them and compile successfully. What 
I think the problem is, but can't find where to fix is the "identifier 
redeclared: rename".

 I've searched all the source code for declarations of rename that would 
mess with unistd.h, but pico and the c-client seem to be the only ones.

Since I'm not familiar at all with the code, does anyone out there 
(hello, pine development team! :-) have any idea where to look or what to 
do to fix this?

thanx, and I hope this isn't a FAQ or something,

shy

P.S. cc doesn't seem to be the usual /usr/bin/cc, but is 
/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc and thus the package uses cc5.sol.

I would suggest to you that there are already the three levels that some
folks want.  There is the global configuration file, the individual
configuration file and there are the compilation options.  But the
individual ought to be able to override the global configuration on most
things.

One should remember that on most unix systems MUAs are user level programs
that don't require privilege.  With docile users (or in a rigid corporate
environment) you may be able to impose strict rules.  But in many places
anyone can bring in their own MUA and use it.  This means that
restrictions on the configuration of MUAs better have good rationales and
that the global configuration is primarily to make it convenient for most
users to use the program without having to worry about the configuration.

Hello.  The c-client MMDF support is contributed code, and there are 
various rumors about whether or not it really works.  I think that it 
needs some hacker attention to knock it into shape.  We don't use MMDF 
here, so it's somewhat difficult for us to fix it.

Subject: IMAP or PC-PINE problem?
Date: Fri, 04 Feb 94 16:21:45 -0800
From: bellc@ucs.orst.edu
X-Mts: smtp


We have IMAP 3.2 and PC-PINE 3.89.   When trying to save a message to a
folder on the mainframe (the IMAP server) is says "IMAP error: APPEND
request unknown:"  then "Save Request Unknown:".  It works fine if you
save them on the local PC.  I had assumed it was a problem with the
IMAP server, however another IMAP client "Mailstrom" (a mac client) will
save folders on the mainframe just fine.

Anyone have any helpful hints?

It appears that you are running the old Stanford IMAP2 server which is 
based on RFC-1064.  You need to have an IMAP2bis server, such as the UW 
IMAP server, in order to save messages on the server from PC Pine.

Note that the Stanford IMAP2 server uses the COPY command, and thus can 
only copy messages from one folder on the server to the other.  IMAP2bis 
servers have the more general APPEND command (which is what PC Pine 
uses), so the source and destination can be different systems.

I agree. Klaus may wish to use non ASCII characters only locally. But I
also think that we all should try to keep internet messages in *English*. 
In addition, even many (not all) computer applications should remain in
English and restrict themselves to ASCII.

Randy,

IMAP 3.2(85) is a very ancient version of imapd.  You should download the 
latest version from ftp.cac.washington.edu.  The source is in the file 
mail/imap.tar.Z or there are selected binaroes in the mail/unix-bin 
directory.

Thanks for the report!

True on many but not all systems. Some of us (and not just me!) run mail 
systems on restricted shell unix systems where the usrs do not have the 
freedom to install their own programs, and where we have to do a lot of 
work to keep them out of things we dont want them to have (shell busters 
like calling your own editor, for example).
 
Compilation options are fine when they exist, but if they dont we are 
down to hacking or nagging the developers.

Hm, my message was encoded using ISO 8859-1. My message SAID so. How
come you tried to read it in JAPANESE?

I think (while not being SURE) there is a bug somewhere here.

Yes, your message was encoded using 8859-1, and yes, I was warned that it was
not likely to be displayed correctly.  But my terminal was not capable of
displaying 8859-1.  It is only capable of displaying Japanese.

> I think (while not being SURE) there is a bug somewhere here.

Pine had the choice of displaying the 8859-1 in the Japanese character set
(and hoping that there would be enough ASCII that I could make some sense of
it), or it could refuse to display it at all.  I claim that Pine did the right
thing by giving me a warning, and then trying to show me something.

The point is, not everyone can assume that every terminal in the world has
8859.  It is Euro-centric to assume otherwise.

Don't forget, there are more people who use East Asian characters than there
are Europeans; if it came down to it, they out-number you.  This is the
underlying fault of the ``8-bit clean is enough'' idea.

We all need to be very careful to make sure we have a match in character sets
between sender and receiver and not make assumptions.  If there is any
question about the capabilities of the receiver's terminal, it is best to
limit yourself to ASCII.

OK, this is were I misunderstood you. I had gotten the impression you
weren't being warned.

I agree.

Still, I would like this mechanism used in the header also (well,
actually I'm content with the real name part in the FROM, TO, CC etc
fields).

While that is true, it is also true that there are more Europeans than 
Americans, and since 8859 will also cope very well with N America, 
perhaps it is a better default?

Well and all but it is hard to know, especially if one is a naive sender 
of mail typing what to you are normal characters.

On the general issue, the problem is not solved until ISOCODE/ISO 90646 
comes into effect, but we will then all have to embrace the implications.

Sure. But I would make a difference between local and international
communications. 

It is important for us to understand each other. A good "tool" for this
purpose is English. I am happy to have the possibility to communicate all
over the world, even if I have some difficulties, with the language or
with the character set.

One change to Pine that we would like is to prevent the user from setting
the user-domain and use-only-domain-name variables.  It is inappropriate
in our environment for users to change these.  If they do, they send out
messages that can't be replied to by the recipient. 

To use the terminology introduced above, I have "hacked" the code to 
give out a message if the user sets either of these variables.

I was going ask the Pine development team if they could add a compilation
option for this.  Or it could instead be done by the third configuration
file that others are suggesting.  This is the file that overrides the
user's settings of some variables.

I'm having a small problem with the pre-authentication mechanism on my 
SGI clients and have been unable to determine the cause so far. Hopefully 
someone out there has some insight.

Setup: SGI as mail/imap server, Sun as NIS server

Problem: SGI clients insist on login/password to access the mail server.

Hints: Suns and SGI mail/imap server have no problems with 
pre-authentication. Doesn't matter whether or not the passwd info is in NIS 
or local to machines.

Configuration:
l--------- 1 root sys 20 Jan 28 13:25 /etc/rimapd@ -> /usr/local/etc/imapd

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys       549268 Feb  7 09:30 /usr/local/etc/imapd

inetd.conf entry
imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/etc/imapd    imapd

If anybody has experienced this or has any ideas about what might be 
causing it, I'd really appreciate the input. Other admins on campus who 
have similar setups tell me they don't have this problem, but I've been 
unable to determine differences in setups that would account for the 
difference in behavior (unless they aren't running 3.89 as I am trying to 
do).

But I have a very hard job in explaining this to my 3000 users who HAVE a

Seems I found the problem after digging around in the source code. There 
is a bug in the os_sgi.c code for the c-client in the pine-3.89 
distribution. Line 411 of this file reads:

    execl ("/usr/ucb/rsh","rsh",hostname,"exec",service,0);

It should read:

    execl ("/usr/bsd/rsh","rsh",hostname,"exec",service,0);

There is no /usr/ucb directory on SGIs (at least not ones running 4.0.x). 
Changing this line and recompiling pine seems to have remedied the 
problem I was having.

As a data point, inside the US and Canada there are still a great many
terminals which do not support 8859.  In fact, most *terminals* do not support
8859; it's the small set of lucky people who have X terminals who have 8859
capability by default, plus a few who have the right terminal emulator on
their Mac or PC.

It is only until very recently that the US was the ``majority'' of the
Internet (now, it's merely the ``largest country represented'' on the
Internet).  Furthermore, you have to consider the looming importance of Asia
in the Internet scene.  Asia is already more important than Europe in
international economy, and there's no reason to believe the steamroller is
going to stop at that.

All this suggests that it is not safe to assume 8859 as a given except within
Europe.  7bit ASCII is the only thing that you can reasonably assume is
universal.

Hello.

There is a bug in Pine 3.89 on SGI systems related to preauthentication.  It
is fixed in Pine 3.90.

In pine/imap/non-ANSI/c-client/os_sgi.c, find the reference to "/usr/ucb/rsh"
and replace it with RSHPATH (no quotes).  Then rebuild.

Well, I very naively just set ISO-8859-1 in my PINERC and got the magic 
characters from that Finnish name loud and clear; I then set codepage 850 
and keyboard uk, and my whole world worked normally. What's the point? I 
have a bog standard PC with no requested special language support.
I have a French Canadian friend who would take strong issue with you on 
the underlying point, which he calls linguistic and cultural fasciscm 
(yea, he is really hot on this point!) basically, it is bad enough that 
most computer applications assume that people *speak*  English, but for 
heavens sake let them *write* other languages, and especially their names!

I assumed we were talking about the total computing economy - just 
because Europe has been slow in taking up internet, doesnt mean it can be 
ignored, especially as the solutions are already there, and just need to 
be used.

As I said in  my earlier message, the linguistic problem is wider than 
Europe and not just confined to Asia (Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish, Greek, are 
European in scope these days); the problem solution to that is "in the 
wings" and no one will be able to ignore it.

All very well, but you will find that you cannot then write some people's 
names in messages.

Sorry to go on a bit (it always helps oneself perhaps more than the 
readers) but it is an issue on which Europeans (and other people world 
wide who do not have the English alphabet as their first written 
language) feel very strongly, and on one which US based computing has 
historically been very blind to.

Barry -

     It is important to understand that when one waves the banner of
``linguistic and cultural fascism'' one should be sure that one's own house is
in order.  8859 is not universal.  It is a regional character set.  It may be
recognized outside that region.  But -- and this is important -- there are
other regional character sets, and they use an overlapping space with 8859.

     I doubt very much that EDCfB@O: displays as anything sensible on your
terminal, yet that is a standard representation of a person's name in that
person's language.  It's just not 8859.

     This is not a simple problem to solve.  If it were simple, we would have
solved it by now!

      Americans are not immune from the problem either; they just are closer
to the subset and don't have to worry about losing any letters.  Backslash is
yen-sign in Japan.  Sharp-sign is the British currency symbol in the UK.
Dollar sign, at-sign, and other familiar characters (to us) are also different
in various national variants of ASCII.

     In other words, the lingua franca of Internet email is a *subset* of 7bit
ASCII.  To be safe, you have to stay within that subset unless you are
communicating within your region.  Even after Pine supports RFC-1522 header
encoding, it'll still be advisable to have an acceptable 7bit representation
of your name along with the 8859 version.

 Hello !

 I have to say I am not very experienced user of pine. But all are 
starting one day :-) So instead of digging in manuals or in archives of 
this mailing list I have decided to ask those probably easy questions:

 1. When you open your INBOX you have mails sorted from newest (top)
to oldest (bottom) that comes to you. Is there a way to have mails 
permanently sorted from oldest (top) to newest, just like in any other 
folders ?

 2. When pine is running and new mail comes (you can see in on you xbiff, 
which checks mailbox once in 10 s.) you have to wait really long time 
until pine will realize that there is some thing new in mailbox. It is 
very irritating. And most of the time it is quicker to quit pine and 
re-run it again. Is there a way to force pine to reopen INBOX ? Or to 
customize time beatweane checking mailbox ?

 3. Is there a plane to write Xwindows interface to pine ? Or may be there
is written one ... ? 

 If it is a FAQ or it is well explained on one of the page of the manual 
just please give me the pointer :-)

 Thanks 

 Wojtek Bogusz

I've just noticed this behavior of pine v3.89 ( & v3.88 ).  User on a 
solaris box, with his/her home directory on an ultrix 4.2a box, fires up 
pine, composes a message, and sends the message.  The message is sent 
(and correctly received to another individual), but -- pine hangs with 
the "Sending mail" message.  I am unable to break out of pine -- I 
basically have to kill the process.  

If a solaris user with home directory on solaris box, or ultrix user with 
home directory on ultrix box fires up pine, pine works as I would expect, 
great...

Wojtek,

You can set the default sort ordering by changing the "sort-key" variable 
in your ".pinerc" file.  If you press "N" several times at the bottom of 
the index or press "^L" in the index, that will force pine to recheck 
your inbox.  We have no immediate plans to write an X interface for Pine, 
but we have heard reports of someone else doing their own conversion.

I must say I agree with Mark. I'm quite happy to write "pds" (or even "UK pds") 
instead of the pound symbol as I know that character may not display as 
intended; also to address one of my German colleagues as Guenther to avoid the  
                                                         ^^
u-umlaut. 

The whole point about communication is that we should be certain that it can be 
read reliably at the other end wherever that may be, and the only sure way to do 
that is to use the lowest common denominator - as Mark says, a subset of 7-bit 
ASCII. It would be much worse to have to think about what sort of alphabet the 
other end might be using before composing a message.

Even within one country there are differences. I'm in the UK, but my X
terminal does not show a pound sterling symbol for ASCII character 35 - it
shows a hash (= "sharp sign").

There are standard TLAs for the world's currencies, used by banks, 
airlines, etc. I don't know if they are a formal ISO standard. Anyway, for 
pounds sterling, you should use GBP, and for U.S. dollars, USD. No doubt 
there is a list somewhere on the Internet...

When a from line contains a personal name that contains commas
PINE seems to have problems extracting the correct reply address.

Example of a from line that causes problems:

From:"Laura, Veglac, .... lots, of, junk" <the_real_name@verifone.com>

Is there an easy fix for this?

Thanks.

Using a common *language* like English when communicating in a forum
like this makes total sense. All words in english use characters
available in ASCII.

But sometimes it is necessary to refer to names, places etc in
countries that use extended alphabets. And why should't people with
capable MIME-readers be able to see then "=C5ke =D6st=E4ng"'s or some Asi=
ans
name like it was intended to be viewed, if at all possible?

And when it can't be viewed properly, the MUA should do it's best.
What's the difference beteen seeing that name as "Ake Ostang", "]ke
\st{ng", "_ke _st_ng", "Eke Vostdng" or whatever your MIME-reader
decides on showing when the charset is missing?  All of these are
obfuscations of the guys real name, equally "useless".

In this particular example the first alternative is the best
approximation and could be achieved by using mapping tables between
some character sets. There is existing code and "standard" for this
available in the public domain (forgot wo wrote it though).

But if the name was in Hebrew (8859-9?) or some Asian language it just
can't be mapped properly on a 7bit terminal. So what?  If the writer
wanted everyone on the world top see it he should supply an alternate
view (MIME supports that, does Pine?).

In earlies version Pine could map 8bit-chars in the wrong charset to
"_" or something, and that's an option the user that's afraid that odd
8bit characters in an unavailable charset may screw up the terminal,
should use. =


(BTW, are we talking about 8bit in pine-list or in general here?  Of
 course we should talk in English here but a little non-ASCII doesn't
 hurt anyone...)


A big point about MIME IMHO is that the user writing a mail shouldn't
have to worry about the capabilities of the receivers MUA.  MIME tags
everything that's in your mail and then it's up to the receivers MUA
to do whatever's appropriate.  Using ISO vs Unicode/Asian charsets are
irrelevant, a good MUA should be able to adopt new registred
MIME-charsets and types.

Pine is great in many respects but has some way to go before it
becomes a good MIME-reader for other languages, for example it should
support character mapping tables and viewing attachments in other
charsets by switching the terminals charset (for xterm for
example). The "metamail" package can do things like this.

This discussion went the wrong track somewhere; the original question
was why MIME was not supported in the header when it is so in the
message body?  These two types of encodings are described in the same
RFC. The answer was that it WILL be, and we applause that (and eagerly
wait for it).

>> in order.  8859 is not universal.  It is a regional character set.

So is ASCII...

Ah, I see here a misunderstanding. To me an internet message might be
to the guy in the next room, or to the gal accross te Atlantic ocean.
The guy might understand just english, while the gal prefers swedish.
Whatever. Both are internet messages. 

I do agree in english being the lingua franca in todays computer
related world, and that it's wise giving a version of ones written
name using just A to Z -- but I still think it's plus non good NOT
being able to write once native name TOO, especially as the technical

Yes, I'd still like to see Pine starting to cope with this.

Here I clearly over reacted, sorry for my bad handling of english.

This is a known problem with the display routines in the composer.  Pine
will still interpret it correctly though.  We will fix it as soon as one
of us gets up the nerve to dig into the bowels of Pico ;)

We run three variants of Pine 3.89:

   sun    for computers running SunOS 4.1.2 and SunOS 4.1.3
   sol    for computers running SunOS 5.2 and SunOS 5.3
   hpp    for computers running HP-UX 9.01

All uses of Pine on these machines use IMAP to access the user's inbox.
The IMAP daemons run on a SunOS 4.1.3 computer called venus.  We are using
the version supplied with Pine 3.89, namely IMAP2bis Version 7.5(72). 

When Pine is run, it sets up two rsh processes to venus:

   rsh venus exec /etc/rimapd

When Pine 3.89 (or 3.88) is run on a SunOS 5.2 machine, sometimes one of
the two rsh processes still remains after the user has left Pine.  This
happens quite often during the day.  But I haven't worked out why it
happens on some occasions and not on others. 

Is this a known problem?  Has anyone else seen this?

We have the following problem:

Is this known or intended ?

Perhaps I should have said "international messages", or "messages to an 
international audience".

Wishing to display your name in your language via e-mail to people that
understand your language is legitimate. But I would use non-ASCII only for
well defined targets and with care. Certainly an international mailing
list or an international news group would not be an adequate audience.
Receiving a name in a Japanese font, for example, would make no sense for
me, even if my computer would be able to display it correctly.

Hi!

I have two quick questions about Pine. If anyone can help please let
eddie@cfd.mech.unsw.oz.au know.

1. How do you switch off the debug mode in pine i.e. so that debug files 
   are not printed.

2. When using the basic unix mail command it is possible to put it into 
   verbose mode so that you can see it sending the mail and if it actually 
   got there or not.  Is it possible to do the same thing in pine? I.e. 
   put it in a verbose mode?


Thanks
Eddie

Eddie,

To switch off debugging, use the -d0 command line option.  Pine does not 
yet have a verbose send mode, but we are considering making it an option.

I received a message with a MIME attachment, to which I wanted to reply. 
Having been caught once before, I checked carefully before sending the 
reply, and noticed that Pine 3.89 had added the attachment to the reply,
which doesn't seem right to me. One would rarely want to send an attachment
back to its sender, I feel.

However, I was able to delete the attachment before sending the message, 
which saved some embarrassment, but the recipient tells me that the message 
was nevertheless sent as MIME MULTIPART/Mixed, despite having no 
attachments. This must be a minor bug...

Regards,
Philip

This is a problem that has bothered me a long time, but I haven't had
any luck in finding a nice solution. Perhaps someone in this mailing
list has figured it out??

We use HP9000/730 hosts with HP/UX 9.01 and from 700/RX X-terminals
configured to use HP-Vue. PINE does not of course work properly with
the default HpTerm terminal windows, you must use Xterm. In HpTerm
cursors keys won't work etc. weird things happen. Modifying ttyin.c
would surely fix this, but that's not my idea of having fun :-)

Even when you use xterm, you must start pine from a shell. Starting pine
by using 'xterm -e pine', which starts pine directly without invoking any 
shell first, does not work properly. Something goes wrong with the
tty-driver and the screen becomes messy. This would work however: 
'xterm -e csh -c pine'

but executing the shell in between is really a waste of CPU time and system
resources. The shell shouldn't really be needed. Then you could of course
make a shell script (say eg. 'exec.pine') that contains 
#!/bin/csh
exec pine

executed by 'xterm -e exec.pine', to get rid of the shell after pine starts.
This isn't very elegant either. Also, pine won't start from tcsh or zsh
properly, you must use csh. This is the only program that I know of, that
behaves like this. Answer may be found from ttyout.c's 2000 lines of code,
or maybe it's HPs fault?

The standard way to put something like pine into Vue Workspace Menu is 
modifying your ~/.vue/vuewmrc (or system-wide '/usr/vue/config/sys.vuewmrc') 
in the following manner:

Menu VueRootMenu
{
    "Workspace Menu"               f.title
    pine _P Meta<key>F11 f.exec "xterm -e pine"
    ...etc...
}

Can somebody explain why doesn't this work, and I really must use the ugly:
    pine _P Meta<key>F11 f.exec "xterm -e csh -c pine"

Equivalently, adding PINE to Front Panel goes like this. To a file called
'/usr/vue/config/panels/fp.mail' you add (included in vuewmrc):
CONTROL Pine
{
  TYPE button
  IMAGE mail
  LABEL "Pine"
  PUSH_ACTION f.exec "xterm -e /usr/local/bin/pine"
}
...etc...
BOX Bottom
{
  TYPE             secondary
  CONTROL          Pine
}
...

which of course doesn't work, you must make it
  PUSH_ACTION f.exec "xterm -e /bin/csh -c /usr/local/bin/pine"

************************
Note, that you can also replace PINE as your MAILER action, which means that 
you could have PINE start from the standard mail button of Front Panel. You 
need a file called '/usr/vue/config/types/pine.vf', that contains:
ACTION Pine
        DESCRIPTION     Pine mailer action 
        TYPE            COMMAND
        EXEC-STRING     /usr/local/bin/pine
        WINDOW-TYPE     TERMINAL
END

then in your '~/.vue/types/user-prefs.vf' OR '/usr/vue/types/user-prefs.vf':

# To use a mailer other than elm, define an action for your mailer and
# substitute it for Elm.
ACTION Mailer
        TYPE            MAP             Pine
END

The problem here is that Vue absolutely refuses to use Xterm disregarding
that I have defined personally and system-wide TERMINAL action as Xterm. 
Vue persistently uses Hpterm and Pine thus won't work. A less elegant
work-around is to have a script start the xterm, which would start the
shell and then pine. But that's too desperate...

This doesn't "exactly" answer your question, but...

I have a patch for pine version 3.87 (I haven't updated it to 3.89 yet)
which makes it work properly in an hpterm (I had to because a number of our
users actually use hp dumb terminals--not under x windows).  There are
still a few small problems, but they are basically little reverse video
buglets that don't amount to much (99% of everything works correctly).

I've also talked with the pine maintainers about some more hardcore changes
to their terminal i/o library which would fix the rest of the problems.  We
may work together to integrate the changes in some future release of pine. 

Anyway, if you want the patch, let me know.

Danny

A few questions:
(I moved from elm to pine, my questions might reflect that)
 
1. anyway in pine for having a local signature file v/s remote signature 
file?
 
2. anyway of saving outgoing message by to-field default and if folder
does not exist then put it in sent-mail?
 
3. How do you stop pine from adding the domainname to internal messages.
i.e. If I leave it blank in .pinerc then it recognizes internal mail and
expands userid to username BUT my external mail does not have my correct
return address, so people cannot reply back to me. If I add the domainname
it appends it to internal addresses also which I would prefer not to.
Any solutions?

Thanks

Does anybody happen to have conversion tools already written? I'm 
attempting to migrate one of my sites to IMAP, but I can see that I might 
meet with some resistence since the aliases aren't in compatible formats. 
Particular conversions would need to be from .mailrc and from elm 
formats.

Dear Pine Team,

	We seem to have a problem running pine under AIX v 3.2, I cannot run pine 
with any options, I can't even do a -conf, to see what is what.

	We are using pine 3.89 the m/c is an IBM RS600 Model 320 running AIX 
v3.2.  We are also using pine 3.89 on a DEC 5000/240 running ULTRIX v 4.3 
and pine is running fine there, so we would like to get the IBM up to 
scratch.

	Any suggestions ?

Why won't pine accept commas in file names? They are relatively common in 
file names on Unix... Is there a quoting mechanism that I have overlooked?

This isn't a pine question but I'm interested in how mail managers
deal with end of semester cleanups and people who love to keep all
their mail in their inbox. Do you run a nightly job to remove mail
that is more than xx days old?
many thanks,

Here's a little script one of our UNIX folks worked up to handle conversion of
elm aliases to pine alias form (pretty simple syntax substitution). If you
execute it multiple times it will keep adding another set of your elm aliases to
your pine addressbook, but Pine seems to handle that all right.

#!/bin/csh
#!/bin/csh -vx
# convert elm aliases.text to pine addressbook
# Greg Gustafson
# UMD Information Services
# January 1993
#
if -r $HOME/.elm/aliases.text then
   if -e $HOME/.addressbook then
      set n=1
      while (-e $HOME/.addressbook$n)
         @ n++
      end
      mv $HOME/.addressbook $HOME/.addressbook$n
   endif
   ex - $HOME/.elm/aliases.text << ---
%s/ = / /
%s/ = / (
%s/\$/)/
:w $HOME/.addressbook
---
    set n=`cat $HOME/.addressbook | wc -l`
    echo $n elm aliases converted to pine addresses
else
   echo no Elm aliases found
endif

Hwi there,
	Really sorry to post a non-Pine question (sort of), but no-one on 
the Usenet seems to be willing to help me...

	I need some documentation on VT100 and ANSI escape codes 
including curur positioning and colours, etc, and would be very grateful 
if someone could mail me any info that they have. Thanks.

	Secondly; Pine and ANSI. Is there any way of getting Pine to 
display messages with something like More, for example so that messages 
including cursor postioning information could be displyed correctly (e.g. 
for ANSI animations). I know that you can save out the message, stip off 
the headers and then view it with More, but it would be nice to be able 
to do it all from within Pine...

		Charuuba!

This is news to me. I have been around UNIX for almost 8 years and I have
maybe once or twice only ever seen a filename with a comma in it. But if
you really need to include it, you can always go "To files" after the
"Read File" part and bring it in that way.

I don't know why Pine won't let you tyoe it in, though.

Did you compile Pine from the source distribution or are you using our
pre-compiled binaries?  A number of AIX 3.2 sites have had trouble
building from source, but had no trouble with the pre-compiled version. 
We would like to isolate the problem, but so far have not been able to get
access to any of the problem systems... 

The pre-compiled binaries are available from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
mail/unix-bin directory.

Thanks for the report!

Martin,

No.  We are considering adding it or something similar though.  In the 
mean time, the next version of Pine (due late spring) will include the 
Reply-To: header, which might help solve your problem.

Thanks for the request!

Hi folks,
 
Could you inform me in how far Pine is usable on a
SCO UNIX System. From a pine-ports document that
comes with Version 3.87 of Pine, I understand that
some work has been done by Ken Bobey. By the way,
do you have his e-mail address?

I would also like to know whether there is a binary
version of pine for SCO Unix 3.2, version 4.2.
( I am without a compiler on my system.)
 
Before hand thanks for your help

Hi Paul,
	type "man find" on your UNIX System and you can use instructions
as: 

 find /usr/spool/mail -atime +7 -exec rm {} \;

and found solution to you problem..

Because pine uses the , as a delimeter between files to be included.  
Thus it thinks input.c,v (the RCS file for input.c) is really a request 
to include input.c and v.

The 3.1 version number is the version of the IMAP toolkit, which includes 
many components besides imapd, each with its own version number.  3.1 is 
the last frozen release; 3.2 is the current development version (and 
changes regularly).

And delete even new messages?  Not a good idea.  Ask archie about a
program called mailclean, that's a better solution.

Mmm...  Seems a reasonable choice for those *not* used to *NIX, since
it follows mailer recipient semantics, but shell semantics would
suggest whitespace as a delimiter.

What thinkest thou, O Pine developers?

I'm not a pine developer, but my vote is to require the comma be
quoted, probably with a backslash.  This way non-Unix geeks won't get
screwed by trying to use a comma in a place that is perfectly
reasonable, and Unix geeks will be able to figure out that a backslash
is a good idea.

Am I the only one who has a problem with editors which are *almost* 
emacs, but not quite?

One problem I have with pine is that it's very common for me to ^P into a 
message that I'm replying to and insert text in the middle.  I always 
want to use ^O for this because I've been doing it that way for ten 
years.  Needless to say, when I type ^O, I am surprised every time.

Also, as I was editing the above paragraph, three (count them) three 
times, I tried to use ^K as if I were in emacs.  Was there a decision 
made that the added difficutly of typing ^A^K over simply ^K was 
sufficient to warrant disallowing the functionality of emacs's ^K?  The 
minor frustration I feel every time I type ^K expands when I try to clean 
up by typing ^Y.

And, as long as I'm picking nits, I'd like ^L to center the current line 
rather than do a simple refresh.

Any thoughts?

Chris

I tend to agree with the original poster. Though I suspect that
changing it now is way too late as you'll hit all those pico users.

Certainly I get hit by ^K and ^Y an awful lot, especially as I use
pico for small mails and switch to emacs for larger ones.

Oh well.

Chris,
As a part-time emacs user, I am sympathetic to your frustration.
Remember, however, that emacs has a semi-infinite number of commands that 
can be bound to a large set of keystrokes (because of ESCape... or the 
META key, if there are any of those keyboards still around.)

In Pico we needed to live within the constraint of single control-key 
commands.  We couldn't even use ESCape as an escape option, because we 
wanted arrow keys to work.

We actually started with ^K being like emacs, but feedback from some of 
our early users suggested that this was not intuitively obvious behavior 
for our (original) target audience.  So we changed.  It has occurred to 
some of us that we could add an option that restored emacs-style Ctl-K 
behavior, and this is on the list.  Ctl-O and Ctl-Y are much more 
difficult to deal with, because we just don't have sufficient key space.

I suspect we could reduce your cognitive dissonance a bit by making it 
easier for emacs to be your default editor (e.g. having cursor motion 
into the body of the message trigger the alternate editor.)  That way 
you'd only have to re-map your fingers when in the message header :)
There are some issues in trying to do this, but we will be investigating 
the feasibility.

We welcome all suggestions, save perhaps "Make all keybindings
user-configurable..."

John,
Apologies for the delay in responding.

Does this happen when PC-Pine is in the foreground, or only when it is in 
the background?

	By now you know one of the reason's for a comma in a filename.

	The next question.  Do you try the "To files" suggestion you
made?  It doesn't work either.  

	I agee with an earlier post that the comma should be quoted
via backslash for us *NIX geeks.

	Yes, I know what you mean.  I have the same problem when I get
into a Ford Fiesta in Australia.  Everything is almost the same...but
there are enough differences that I get confused.  I was tempted to
ask Ford Australia to change their design so that it would make it
easier for me.  However, someone pointed out that if I wanted to use
a Ford Fiesta manufactured in Australia I should get used to it and
not expect Ford to change it for me...when everyone in Australia is
perfectly happy with that model.  :-) :-)

	But to be serious...if you like emacs, and are happy with
emacs, then why don't you configure emacs as your alternate editor and
use emacs?  It would be better than trying to change pico to be like
emacs...which I'm sure was never the intention.

There were a lot of compilation problems when I tried building 3.89 on our
3.2.0 system.  Since 3.07 (or thereabouts) compiled and ran fine I assume
that 3.89 should be okay without too much work.  I was hoping to have done
it myself by now, but for my sins I've been stuck with Solaris support and
haven't had time to work on it.

Hi! Everyone,

Has anyone ever compiled pine3.89 for Dynix v3.2.0?  Will that be legal
and ok to give me a copy?  Staff in my site is not interesting in pine except
users.  If you could give me a copy, please send it  to me and use MINE
format. (I can run pine3.07 here.)  Thank you very much!!

I don't have problem to get imapd, mtest, and pico.  I got my first
compile error on pine.  I added /usr/types.h in os-dyn.h and the program
ran thourgh.  Then the  second problem is the fpos_t was undefined.  I
added typedef unsigned long fpos_t; in the source which needed this variable.
Afterwards, I got something like redeclaration of formal parameter, ptr. I
don't quite understand that.  Finally I gave up! I hope some one  could
give me a hand.

I have changed my terminal definition to an 80x50 variant of vt100.  Most

steadfastly refuse to use the bottom half at all. 

How can I get these two to use the whole screen?

Hi, PINE-wizards,

I was just stroken by an crazy idea, so don't take me serious, but maybe 
it is not crazy enough... ;-))

As the PINE has been used mostly for the processing AND SAVING of text mail
and the lot of text messages in folder may become very large, what about
a built-in compression and decompression routines ( I know, that the 
decompression can be very fast opposite to compression -- e.g ARJ).
I mean by that a compressed folders (switchable by some option in .pinerc)
would be used. Whole folder would be decompressed at once to some temporary
file (or virtual memory) so all operations would be unaffected. 

Regards,

If this is done, Pine should itself quote commas when suggesting file names. 
I started this thread after receiving a MIME-attached file, whose suggested 
name contained a comma. Pine put up the suggested name, but when I pressed 
RETURN, complained about it!

Whilst we're on the subject (well, sort of...) why doesn't PC-PINE 
understand that # is legal in DOS filenames?

It's not quite WordStar either.  I switch between Pico in PC-Pine and
other PC editors, many of which have WS keymapping. I can get used to ^K =
delete line/block, and ^U to undelete is exact WS, but then I find myself
going ^X to go down a line ....  <sigh>


But I do agree that it shouldn't be changed - that way lies madness!

Funny, I tried it, and it did work. I used emacs to create a short test
file called hello,goodbye and was successfully able to include it into a
mailing using ^R^T and cursoring to that filename.

I certainly understand the above issues and it would be absurd to ask for
the full functionality of gnu emacs.  After all, I'd love to have things
like meta-C available, that I know that would be asking too much.  I
actually adapt fairly well to missing functionality, I just don't adapt
well to different functionality.

The problem is that the functionality in the headers is very useful, so I 
don't really want to give that up.  I think mostly I just felt like 
grousing a little.  After all, this isn't the only "cognitive dissonance" 
that I suffer from:  since I also use a Mac a lot, whenever I'm in gnu 
emacs 19, I keep expecting that if I mark a region and start typing that the 
marked region will magically be deleted.  I don't suppose you can solve 
this for me.  (There was a time that I was using three editors and had a 
problem with the escape key:  One of them was teco where hitting the 
escape key twice executed my commands, so I got used to doing that often. 
Another one had escape toggle into a help screen so I kept having my 
screen refreshed needlessly.  A third one was the real problem: in the 
UCSD Pascal editor escape aborted the current insertion.  In short; 
things have been worse in the past, so I shouldn't complain too much.)

On a more useful note:  I've loaded the mime tools for emacs (available
from wnoc-fuk.wide.ad.jp:pub/GNU/etc/emacs-mime-tools.shar) into my
system, and it would be nice if it worked when I escaped into my alternate
editor (emacs); put it in mime mode; inserted some mime stuff;  and
returned to pine.

Jon,

Try "stty rows 50 cols 80" before entering Pine.

Thanks for the request!

Add this as one more reason why not to change pico:
I'm used to use elm on UNIX with vi as the editor. Please change pine to 
act just as vi ;-)

We only have Dynix/PTX systems here, so we must depend on outside 
contributions for non-PTX systems.  If someone will send us diffs to make 
Pine 3.89 run on Dynix (non-PTX) we will make every effort to roll those 
changes into Pine 3.90.

Sorry I don't have any better news!

Petr,

This has been suggested before.  Our basic opinion is that disk space is 
cheaper than the extra CPUs we would have to buy to support compression 
for a given amount of raw data.  If you would like to write a c-client 
driver for compressed mailboxes, we can probably incorporate it into the 
distribution.  Look in c-client/mbox.c for a template you might want to 
start from.

Thanks for the request!

Sherry,

Yes, in Pine 3.89 you can *read* news, assuming you already have a .pinerc
file created by another newsreader.  Just set the news-collections
variable in your .pinerc file to point to your NNTP server(s).  The next 
release of Pine will include support for subscription, unsubscription, 
posting, etc.

Thanks for the request!

Greetings,
	I have a small request to make for Pine; I know about the 
Reply-To: header is going to be introduced, but can we please have an 
option to allow us to specify our own headers (and what goes in them; 
whether it is always the same, or editable at the time of message 
composition), and whether they are included in a message or not (like 
bcc: in the rich header...).

	Also, I wholeheartedly approve of any plans to include proper 
News handling. If it could be based on a similar system to rtin 1.2 then 
that would be even better...

	Thanks for listening,

			David

Hi,
	But, then in the "pine/osdep/os-xxx.h file :

=================os-xxx.h========================
/*-- Max screen pine will display on. Used to define some array sizes --*/
define MAX_SCREEN_COLS  (170) 
define MAX_SCREEN_ROWS  (200) 


/*---- When no screen size can be discovered this is the size used -----*/
define DEFAULT_LINES_ON_TERMINAL	(24)
define DEFAULT_COLUMNS_ON_TERMINAL	(80)
========================================================

	Do not solution the problem ??? I have this over screen more 
large on DECWindows emulating vt100 terminal and it's fine...

Later...

We are working on a way to specify extension headers, but have not come 
to any firm design decisions yet.  Thanks for the request!

We are using PC-Pine with an SCO UNIX as mailserver. The mailer program 
on SCO is mmdf.

On the SCO UNIX system we use elm as the mail reader/poster.

Now it is so that PC-Pine can understand and read mails saved with elm on 
the SCO but elm can't understand and read mails saved with PC-Pine. The 
reason is that mmdf and elm saves mails in folders with a line with 4 
CTRL-As before and after each mail in the folder. If these CTRL-A's are 
not there elm declares the folder corrupt.

Does someone have a good idea about hov to solve that problem ?

Of course we could read the mails in the folders with PC-Pine and resend 
it to ourselves and then read the incoming mail with elm. But that is a 
bit to crazy.

According to the FAQ, text/enriched supersedes text/richtext, but pine
only appears to support text/richtext while exmh is generating
text/enriched.  Can I assume that the next patch to pine will include
the support of text/enriched to the same limited extent that
text/richtext is currently supported?

Burzin,

Pine does not currently have an option for alternate signatures.  We are 
considering the addition of a "FCC-folder-name-rule" similar to the 
saved-msg-name-rule.  If the user-domain variable in your .pinerc file is 
blank, Pine should use whatever is returned by your system.  The issue of 
when to use it is kind of a hot topic, but we find it to be much safer 
and more predictable to always fully qualify addresses.

Thanks for the requests!

I don't think pine should become a full news-reader. There are many
readers that are both powerful and easy to use and which are easily
obtainable on the net.
I would prefer to see pine as a mail agent only, which does what
it is supposed to do and doesn't try to be an all in one package.

I would like to suggest adding an option of making an uuencoded attachment
in addition to the MIME attachments. Many people don't have MIME, and it
will be nice if it was possible to send a uuencoded file to those people 
from within pine. An automatic decoding would be nice as well :)

I'd like to express our appreciation for the work you are doing with 
PINE.  I believe it is of great benefit to the Internet Community.  Not 
to appear ungreatful, but we understand that you are planning on 
providing multiple personal and shared addressbook capabilities in a 
future release of PINE.  We are trying to move to an electronic office 
and would greatly appreciate if these capabilities were made available 
ASAP.  In addition, we are looking for scheduling/calendar capabilities 
which would ideally be integrated into our mail system.  We understand 
that these may be on you "long list".  It would be great if these 
capabilities were given more attention sooner than later if possible.  
Thanks.

Gayland G. Gump
One of the Good Guys!

Would it be possible to define Control-D on the index screen and main

It would be most helpful to have multiple personal and shared 
addressbooks included in the next release of pine.

Will release of new versions of pine be announced in this group ?

In the docs. following pine it says that a pine version for Windows is=20

OK, I have PCPINE running from a PIF, and it now seems not to lose its 
IMAP connection! Thanks for your help. For the FAQ my PIF settings are as 
follows (386 enhanced mode, BTW)

Prog filename 	C:\PINE\PINE.EXE

                    (none - I can't be bothered typing all the boxes!)

Application shortcut key   [None     ]


I did have Background priority set to 50 (not 50% BTW - 50 out of 10000)
but increased it the first time PINE lost its IMAP connection (when in the
background). However at the time I didn't have the Background execution
box checked, which meant that PINE didn't get any time when in the
background anyway (and of course it lost its connection), so I can
probably put it back to 50 again.  I understand that if any other
application is set for Execution: Exclusive flag then it will hog the
processor and prevent PINE getting timeslices, so there's still no
guarantee that PINE will never lose its connection when in the 
background, but at least it won't do so when nothing else is happening.

I'm not sure about the memory requirements - I'm pretty sure PINE 
doesn't use XMS or EMS, but I guess it does want 640K if it can get 
it...?

I switched off Detect idle time as I understand (from good old Windows
Secrets) that Windows can cut off the app thinking it's not doing anything
if this setting is on. I wonder if PINE is Windows-aware and tells windows
when it's not doing anything anyway? 

Maybe some Windows guru out there can suggest further tweaks.

At our site, everybody has access to pretty much the same file system so 
it would actually be preferable to use 

	Content-type: message/external-body; access-type=local-file

over actually attaching the file.  I'd like to be able to specify that a
file is either attached or referenced under user control and also be able
to set the default at our site to use references instead of attachments 
as it does at present.  (Of course, it would be nice if this default 
depended on wether or not there were off-site addresses in the to list, 
but that's hard to do reliably due to mailing lists, etc.)

Subject: Wishes for Pine Improvements

I love Pine!  It isn't as flexible as Elm or as Mac-like as the Mac-Eudora
client.  Nor does it act as a client that will phone my account periodically
like AOL does.  Still it is a wonderful product.  My students, who are local
teachers, have found ways to circumvent their VMS account, which doesn't use
Pine, to telnet to WSUV, which does.  That's proof of its ease of use.  

I would like to see Pine as a Mac POP client that uses the communications
toolbox, much as Eudora does.  There are many advantages to reading and
writing mail offline.  The first is that I can't get online.  there just
aren't enough dialups anymore.  The second is that when I do get on, the net
is too slow to think and write at the same time.  This is why I've started
forwarding my mail to AOL from my UNIX account.  I can't check my mail
several times per day automatically and read and write offline.  When the
dialups are busy, I don't worry because I know they will eventually be free
and I don't have to keep trying to get on manually. 

I'd also like to see multiple personal and shared addressbooks.  This would
help me organize my lists (e.g., class, 
committee, department, professional, etc.).  

Keep up the good work.

Chris,

We plan to add support for message/external-body in a future release of 
Pine.  Thanks for the suggestion!

How can I stop users from move about in our file system?  

They can use the "attach" feature to "go to files", and roam freely. 
Granted, they can't do much, but one student just tried to mail a "core".

Seems like if someone has read permissions, they should be able 
to move there.  Don't try to overcontrol for the low probability
event.

I have just been the victim of a very troubling problem.  My mail directory
was set to 755 permissions and many of my saved mail folders were set to 
644.  I also found evidence that my mail was read by others since this 
hole opened up.  Being the sys administrator here, this is a real bad
problem. I now have to go through 5 megs of saved messages, look for 
compromising information and correct it.

To settle some fears, No, Pine was not responsible for this. Also created 
in my mail directory was a subdir used by Macintosh file serving software 
that I installed on Unix months ago.  Apparently, it changed the permissions,
probably based on the "Privileges" menu item on the Mac that I had checked 
incorrectly.

Yes, this is a stupid user mistake of the highest order, especially since
I should know better.  

But what I am suggesting is the following. Since Pine is geared towards 
novices (and idiots like myself), can it be made to double check access 
rights when opening a folder for world-read permissions and perhaps warn 
the user in the status window ("Warning: Your folder is set to be readable 
by everyone on the system")?

On one hand, a MUA shouldn't have to worry about double-checking for 
stupid luser mistakes, but on the other hand, it might make a nice public 
service feature!  I can't really think of many reasons why people's mail 
should be publically readable. If it is to be shared, it should be in a 
public type newsgroup or bbs type thingamajig.

It would seem that a better solution to the problem you describe would
be the option to save folders encrypted with some password. Then it
wouldn't matter a lot if file security were compromised. Obviously it
raises the issue of people forgetting their encryption keys, but I
think that only argues for this not being the default. This sort of
thing is becoming a more and more commonplace option in all sorts of
utilities so I think people basically knows what it means and whether
they want it or not (or understand in a sentence.)

The only other problem it raises is the whole export regs spectre, but
perhaps the right approach is the sysadmin or someone enters the
command to be run on the file to encrypt or some such thing.

I remember some mention of a multiple delete in coming versions of Pine. 
This is a VERY useful feature I'd like to see implemented. The ability to 
tag messages 1-30 for deletion. Thi might work as a command line option 
or like Pico's multiple line selection.

Another feature that is standard in other mail programs and would make a
lot of sense to me...the ability to jump to the top or bottom of a message
(or file in Pico).

I think that existing utilities for secure email, namely PGP, are a 
better way to go that creating Yet Another Format for encryption.  PGP 
has a number of features that make it much more secure than what the pine 
developers would be able to whip up.  

I would prefer that Pine be developed to make it easier to integrate PGP 
encryption and decryption by allowing the user to pipe the contents of 
the current message thru a filter.

Which brings up the topic of the Clipper chip.  The US governement 
wants to make Clipper the standard because it will be able to hold the 
keys to decrypt anything it wants to see.

Yes, had you read my whole note before responding you would have seen
this is precisely what I said and could have saved us all this
follow-up.

As to PGP specifically last I heard it was still claimed to be in
violation of the RSA patent. I assume, however, you are an officer of
your university with fidiciary responsibilities so are able to make
the determination of potential liabilities for yourself. I am such an
officer of my company and have made my own decision.

No, actually it does not bring up the topic of the Clipper chip since
this has nothing to do with Pine development except perhaps in the
distant future (does Pine use any chips explicitly? Is it likely to?)

My suggestion about export regs was meant only as an argument for a
site-configurable command to encrypt so sites which do not have
something like DES can use something else without trouble, and the
pine folks don't have to worry about complying with export regulations
since they wouldn't be shipping any cryptography software, only a
method for incorporating your own. That would be a proper devpt issue.

Excuse me, but I did indeed read your entire article.  If you look back
at my reply, I quoted your last section, so I had obviously read it.

Regardless of legal issues, all I'm asking is that pine be configured to
allow people to use filters of thier own creation, be they PGP or just
crypt.  I think creating the option to pipe out the current message 
would be a heck of alot more useful than simple encryption of a 
folder.

I'm a student here that happens to work as a student consultant doing 
network support.

I think the whole topic of encryption in the US leads to discussion of 
clipper.  I'd rather know that my mail is indeed secure, and not able to 
be opened when the government feels like snooping around in it, or when 
someone else manages to get the keys.  I'd rather hold the keys to my own 
mail box, thank you.

I wasnt asking that the pine developers ship copies of PGP with Pine, 
just that the ability to pipe the current message out to a filter program 
defined by the user.

I just tried to postpone composition of a message so that I could get 
back to my mail folder and refer to another message. I was told that 
another message composition had also been postponed and so I couldn't 
postpone the current one. I didn't know I had another one postponed, and 
that raises this enhancement request.

I think what would be useful would be for Pine to remind me at some point
that I have already postponed a composition. Not just when I start it up,
because now that I can run it in a Window I leave it running, but also
when I Reply to or Forward a message that puts me into the composer

Alternatively, or in addition, maybe Pine could allow multiple postponed 
compositions (would this tie in with the proposed /Unsent flag in imap?)?

Clipper refers only to digital telephony cryptography. The computer
system implementation is called Capstone. The secret NSA/NIST
algorithm is Skipjack.  Nothing (yet) in the current U.S. government
proposals prohibits private citizens from using any encryption schemes
they wish in their electronic mail or file transfers.  There are
plenty of good reasons for opposing the key escrow, secret algorithm
and special chip proposals widely mis-referred to as the "Clipper
initiative", as well as for opposing the restrictions on encryption
software exports, but threat to software email encryption is probably
not among them.

See the Risks forum 15.47 and following, for a good discussion of the
current state  or peruse documents on the gopher and ftp servers of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, gopher.eff.org and ftp.eff.org.

User agent support for viewing encrypted mail deserves a little more
thought than simply providing hooks to external filters---which in my
opinion is a Good Thing on its own. For example, automatic reply to an
encrypted message should possibly be encrypted by default, with key
options that permit the use of the same key or one-time key
generation. Already viewed mail should possibly remain encrypted for
storage, etc. etc.

Of course, the best thing would be to embed a Lisp interpreter in Pine
with access to messages and other internal objects. Then we could use
the 20 years worth of emacs lisp contribiutions out there, including
ones which deal with encryption..... Hah, hah, only serious.

	Can't the people who give out accounts on your system make sure 
that the .profile or .login file or whatever sets the default permissions 
appropriately.  That's where the responsibility lies.  Sure some of us 
who don't know what we're doing may override that (change it), but then 
it's our fault if our mail is readable by the world.  This is not, in my 
view, pine's job.

Sorry if this question has been asked before - I'm new to this mailing
list.

I'm working on setting up a mail system for our computer center. We
have Unix, Macs, and VAX's. Unix and Macs are not a problem - but
can a VAX=A0act as a IMAP client and use Pine or even VMS Mail? It=20
would be nice to just use Pine. Sometime in the future this mail
system might include an IBM mainframe running MVS/ESA. Is it possible
to run IMAP on the IBM? (please don't laugh :)

Thank you,

I installed PINE 3.88 on our MUSS System in Dec. 93. MUSS is running  
SunOS 5.2 Generic on a SUN Sparc. Our System Analyst reports the problem 
below. Has anyone had a similar problem? I remember seeing dialogue on 
the read/write lock/unlock but don't recall the details. Thank you in 
advance. Your help is really appreciated.

Carolynn:-

	There seems to be a problem using PINE on MUSS.  I am not sure if 
the problem is with the students or a coding problem or a combination.  I 
have a large number of defunct processes.  This in itself is unusual.  I 
have been having MUSS re-booted to clear these up once a week.  
Unfortunately, the occurance of these defunct processes is increasing 
more rapidly than before.  I have traced these defunct processes back to 
running PINE.
	My request is this:  Would you ask the question of the PINE 
support group (or the interest group) if anyone else is experiencing this 
problem.  It looks like the process has the mail box open and another 
Pine process can't get control of the inbox to open for read-write.

	Thanks.

Is Pine supposed to copy the system pine.conf file to the user's .pinerc 
file the first time it is run? If so, it doesn't appear to be doing so at 
my sight for some reason. Anyone care to comment? What would be really 
nice if there was a system pine.conf file and then a copy of a .pinerc 
file that can be copied to a user's directory on the first startup. That 
way, an admin can only put those parameters that he/she feels the user 
should be messing with in the user's file.

Also, I just got through tracking down a problem with pre-authentication. 
Seems one of my users runs a small program from his .cshrc file. This 
apparently causes him to have to authenticate himself to the mail server. 
Rather annoying little quirk. I have another user who is also being 
required to authenticate, but I haven't tracked down the culprit in his 
case. I'll let you know when I do. These are both people running from 
SGIs in case anyone wants to know.

John,

Currently, Pine reminds you when you enter the composer for an original
composition.  I think it would be terribly distracting to be prompted to
resume a postponed composition on reply or forward.  We do plan to implement
multiple postponed compositions in the future.  I don't know how or if it
will tie in with the /UNSENT proposal. Thanks for the request!

Jeff,

Pine generates a new .pinerc from internal defaults for new users and 
automatically adds any entries that were not found in the original.  This 
is to make sure that all new variables are added after upgrades.

It sounds like you are on the right track with the authentication problem. 
Manually issuing the "rsh host /etc/rimapd" can give some clues if you are
not already using that. 

Thanks for the report!

There are a number of reasons why the user has to type their username and
password each time that they use Pine.  I have tracked down the following: 

(1) The .cshrc file does output to the screen, e.g., it uses the
    echo command.  The user will need to remove the appropriate 
    command(s) from the .cshrc file.

(2) The .cshrc file contains one or more of the Unix commands biff, 
    mesg, stty.  Probably the command can be moved to the .login file.

The problem also occurs if the file /etc/rimapd has not been set up on the
IMAP machine.  This would affect all users that IMAP into that machine.

The problem will also occur if the Pine code executes the wrong command
when it wants to set up a remote shell from the machine running Pine to
the IMAP machine.  For example, if the code says that the remote shell
command is /usr/bin/rsh when in fact the command on the machine running
Pine is /usr/ucb/rsh or /usr/bin/remsh.  Note that both of these would
affect all users of Pine on the machine running Pine. 

If other people know of any more reasons, then I would be interested to
see them.  I also think it would be useful if this information were 
included in the intended FAQ. 

I think some of our users believe that user-authentication is a part of
the way in which Pine works, because it has always done that whenever they
use Pine.  It would be nice to have more ammunition to dispel this rumour.

Just found the problem with the other user's setup. His .cshrc file was 
missing an endif. Found it by trying to manually run rimapd with rsh as 
suggested earlier.

I reported a problem to the pine-info mailing list last week, but got no
response.  Each day I am having to delete about 10 processes left around
by uses of Pine.  Help!  Anybody got any ideas of what's going on.  The
message is repeated below.  Reading your description above, it would
appear that my problem is different to yours.

Subject: one rsh left around after Pine finishes

We run three variants of Pine 3.89:

   sun    for computers running SunOS 4.1.2 and SunOS 4.1.3
   sol    for computers running SunOS 5.2 and SunOS 5.3
   hpp    for computers running HP-UX 9.01

All uses of Pine on these machines use IMAP to access the user's inbox.
The IMAP daemons run on a SunOS 4.1.3 computer called venus.  We are using
the version supplied with Pine 3.89, namely IMAP2bis Version 7.5(72). 

When Pine is run, it sets up two rsh processes to venus:

   rsh venus exec /etc/rimapd

When Pine 3.89 (or 3.88) is run on a SunOS 5.2 machine, sometimes one of
the two rsh processes still remains after the user has left Pine.  This
happens quite often during the day.  But I haven't worked out why it
happens on some occasions and not on others. 

Is this a known problem?  Has anyone else seen this?

Aargh!

Just had another Pine crash - 3.89, running under windows. It did warn me
that there might not be enough memory to send the message I was composing,
but then it bombed out without (as far as I know) saving the message
anywhere! 

Grrr!

Thanks, I think multiple postponed composition is the way to go.  Funnily
enough, in composing this reply (or rather the version before, 'coz Pine
crashed out and lost that message :-( - see my earlier bug report) I got a
flash that I had new mail from David L Miller re: postponed composition,
so I postponed and went to see your mail (it was just the other copy of
this message which you'd sent to me and to the list) and then returned. 

Really it's all a workaround for not having a true Windows Pine, in which 
the index, received message viewer and composer are separate windows with 
multiple instances which the user can swap between. I'm not hassling you 
guys - I'm sure you have lives outside work :-) - just making a (wishful) 
observation!

 Hello !

 I thought it would be nice if pine would add information read from 
passwd when you mail to local user (with out domain name). You could have 
a switch in pinerc telling if you would like pine to behave in that way 
or not. It would be nice too having a switch for adding a domain name to 
the addresses.

 Best regards !

 Wojtek

Subject: move mail spool file to home directory


On our network the users' incoming mail is spooled in /var/spool/mail
which is NFS mounted on all client hosts. To reduce the mail server
load, we would like to move the user's mail spool file to the user's
home directory when the user invokes pine. I set up the mail_link with
the mbox driver in building pine. But it still doesn't do what we
want. Anyone knows how to accomplish that?

Gayland,

Thanks for the kind words!  As I mentioned in a separate message, we will

Richard,

If you press 'V' in this situation, you will go back to the message 
view.  With the current design of the top level screens, ^C is not really 
a meaningful operation.  Thanks for the request!

Regarding my previous message asking info to have pine to move
the user's mail spool file to the user's home directory, after
I did a "make clean" and make pine again, it works. Now
the mail spool file is moved to ~/mbox after pine is run.

The must have an existing ~/mbox before pine will start moving over the
mail.  I accomplished this by creating an empty ~/mbox for every user with
a .pinerc file and then adding an empty one to the default skeleton given
to new accounts.

I've seen what might be a related problem with the 2.3 rshd.  If you run
truss on the stuck process and see it spinning in a 'wait() Err#10
ECHILD' loop then it's the same problem.  Haven't seen anything about rshd
in the Solaris patch database; maybe one of this week's socket/tcp/kernel
patches will fix it.  Then again, maybe not.

Since breaking a MIME multipart message into its component parts is very
easy to do with a text editor (just look for the "--boundary" lines), I
suspect that you are really looking for a base64 decoder.  I have written
a perl package (available from ftp://ftp.ee.und.ac.za/pub/unix/base64.pl)
that includes functions for converting in all six possible directions

Metamail for *NIX or DOS, current version 2.6 to my knowledge,
contains most all the program necessary to deal with MIME.  This does
not include graphic viewers and the like, but will create and chop up
all MIME messages.

Metamail is available at:

Just tried using pine under a new account and noticed something else that 
I'd like to see come in an upcoming version. Pine currently creates the 
mail directory for postponed and interrupted messages. It doesn't create 
the directory(ies) defined by folder-collections in the .pinerc file if 
they don't already exist. It would be a welcome additional feature, I 
think. Enlightenment is appreciated on the matter.

Regarding the earlier problem with the user running a program from his 
.cshrc file and being forced to authenticate, the person who suggested 
the interactive shell check was on the mark. Works like a charm now.

Bill,

Sorry about the slow reply!  This is on our to-do list for an upcoming
version of Pine. 

Thanks for the suggestion!

Jeff,

Thanks for the suggestion!  I'm not sure how quickly we will pursue this 
though, since we consider folder-collections to be a power-user feature, 
and power-users should know how to create directories ;)

Hi,
	I was a happy user of elm until I became a happier user with 
pine. I have elm-style-save=yes in my .pinerc , but there are other 
things that I miss from elm.

1) the ability to sort-tag-save messages from one mailbox to another

2) a feature that I found most desirable and is probably possible with 
pine but I haven't figure it out, is the automatic saving of composed or 
reply messages in the mailbox corresponding with the To: address, i.e. 
this is the line in .elm/elmrc (I think)
# save messages, incoming and outbound, by login name of sender/recipient?
savename = ON


Any thoughts on an X interface to pine as well? :)


When is the next version coming out? I have 3.89

Yes there is. It's called metamail. Metamail is used by elm if it 
receives mails with MIME stuff (if you configured elm to support MIME of 
course. Metamail does not follow elm, so search for "metamail" not "elm".

Simon,

The "elm-style-save" option is now obsolete, having been replaced by a 
couple feature-list options.  At least the first of your suggestions will 
be available in the next release of Pine.  We do not have any current 
plans for an X interface, although we have toyed with the idea of some 
primitive mouse support, about like PC-Pine has.  We are hoping to have 
the next release ready about late spring.  

Thanks for the suggestions!

As a workaround, make a link in your mail directory between the
saved messages file that pine uses and the name you want to use.

Regarding my question yesterday about Pine and IMAP on VMS. I received
some information from Innosoft about their PMDF product - maybe
other VMS users will find it useful.

The next version of Innosoft's PMDF (4.3?) will have Pine and an IMAP
client for VMS. I believe it will be released in about one month.

Sanjeev,

Pine does not yet support MIME external-body constructs, but we do plan 
to implement it in the future.  Until that time, you will need to 
manually execute ftp outside of Pine.  Sorry.

Thanks for the request!

There is a high degree of common functionality and purpose between news
and mail. I for one strongly prefer them to be combined. As a busy
administrator of many systems two into one goes down a treat in reducing
the number of packages to maintain. Also, I don't wish to hop about
between packages when replying to news articles via mail, forwarding etc. 

I use and prefer a common news and mail utility on my PC at home. I think 
you are underestimating the PINE team in implying that they wouldn't make 
as good a job of it as existing news offerings on the net. I'm sure 
they'd do even better! In any case, if you don't want to use PINE's 
in-built news facilities you don't have to. There seems little reason not 
to continue the logical path on which PINE has embarked.

That gets my vote. Even though it's easy to do by shelling out it's a 
common enough operation to warrent a built-in facility IMHO.

I am not positive this is a Pine problem, and now I can't even duplicate
it.  Just created a new user "mtom", and I've triple-checked it by now. 
We have another user "stom" on a different system (but same NIS domain). 
For a while, mtom was sending out messages that had two From headers,
which by itself doesn't seem out of the ordinary, but maybe someone who's
more up on the RFC than I can correct me.  The problem is the headers were
different-- the first said "mtom" and the second said "stom".  The comment
(GCOS) field was even filled in accordingly on the second "From" (which
was actually "From:" with the colon). 

Both users said they could not find the message in the sent-mail folder,
although here I am telling you what I found in this folder.

If you have an idea what might be causing this, I'd like to hear it.  If
someone can definitely rule out that this might be a Pine problem, I'll be
glad to hear that too. :-)

Dave,

The next version of Pine will include all of these.  Thanks for the 
suggestions!

John,

Unfortunately the meanings of those keys are not clearly defined on 
non-PC keyboards.  Many keyboards just send a NULL for both of them...

Dave,

The future of Dynix/ptx here is somewhat uncertain.  Presuming our Sequent
stays around that long, we will certainly port Pine to version 4.  Otherwise
we will support it the best we can with user contributions. 

Thanks for the request!

Alex,

Sorry about the very slow reply, we have been swamped.  Unfortunately we 
do not have alot of experience/expertise with the older SYSV 
environments.  About the closest thing we would have is an as yet 
untested ISC port.  In the long run you might be better off just 
converting the whole system to Linux or NetBSD, both of which have 
working Pine implementations.

Thanks for the request!

	A friendly suggestion for the wonderful pine development team.
	When exporting a message to a file pine (nicely) checks to see if
the file exists.  If it does, the user is given the option of appending
the new message to the end of the exiting file.  If you say "n"o, the
export will be canceled.  (I assume ^C will have the identical effect.)
There is no way, so far as I know, of *choosing* to overwrite the old
message with the new one.  (Of course one could shell out, rm the old
file, and then return to the export, but that's several steps.) So
consider adding:  "File exists, (o) overwrite, (a) append, or (c) cancel?"
	If you don't like this ("hey, the other messages give yes/no 
options instead of a list"), no big deal.

I like this idea too.  I like to save files to 'temp', for example, all the 
time and would rather overwrite it, then append it.

Yes!  That would be very popular here too.

Although having a combined mail client and a newsreader might reduce the
initial installation time of the packages, it will defiantly increase the
complexity of the whole package, making it harder to use.

If you take a look, at any of the newsreaders that are available for UNIX,
you will see that there are many different options, and incorporating them
into pine will create a package that will be extremely hard to use for
novice users. 
I think the best part about pine is it's ease of use, and simplicity, thus
adding so many features will increase the number of options and reduce the
usefulness of the whole package.

I had no intention to imply that the PINE team can't create a newsreader
that will be as good or even better than other newsreaders that are
available, but I just don't feel it is necessary to reinvent the wheel all
over again.

On a UNIX platform there are many good newsreaders, including readers for
the X window system, such as rn, trn, xrn and several others.

If the system in question is DOS based, then I am not sure if there exist
any good newsreaders. In this case a combined news/mail client can be
a good idea, but I feel that the news should be implemented only in PC-PINE,
and preferably as a second package that will interact closely with pine.

Subject: how to influence Pine about MIME type/subtypes??? (please!)

I'm wanting to use Pine to send binary files around, specifically
WordPerfect 5.1, and Microsoft Word. There are IANA defined MIME
type/subtype's defined for these document types
(application/wordperfect5.1, application/msword). When I upload a
WordPerfect 5.1 file from my PC to my workstation and attach it to a
message with Pine, Pine sends it as test/plain. I need some way to tell
Pine that this file is to be sent as application/wordperfect5.1 with base64
encoding. I'd think you'd do that with some type of mapping from the file
extension (e.g., *.w51 maps to application/wordperfect5.1 with base64
encoding). Does Pine support such mappings or is there an alternate way to
accomplish the same objective?

I would really appreciate your help with this question.

Thanks!

The next version of Pine will incorporate much of metamail, though 
perhaps not all.  Specifically, the same mailcap database will be usable 
by pine and metamail.  There will also be a Pipe command that will allow 
calling metamail directly.

Thanks for the request!

Jamey,
We have been struggling with the best way to handle typing of potentially 
ambiguous data.  In some cases, the file extension is the only thing 
available to distinguish the data --but should it be trusted to be correct?

I'm actually surprised that the WP doc ended up as text/plain, rather than
application/octet-stream, but either way we agree that having the official
type recognized is highly desirable.  The existing mechanisms should be
sufficient to get the document to the recipient without corruption (note
that Pine uses B64-encoding even text attachments, to assure their
integrity), but automated processing by the recipient does require proper
typing.

I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the Pine news support.  For
the novice user, the transition from a mail folder to a newsgroup will be
barely noticable. One of the biggest reasons for putting news support into
pine is to give the novice user something that is not as daunting as the
conventional Unix newsreader.  Pine will probably never be as
sophisticated as the big news packages, but they do not meet the usability
needs of our primary target audience!

Is there much difference (in terms of look and functionality)
between the pc and unix versions?  Is the pc version just
as easy to compile and install as unix?  Any feedback (subjective
or objective) is welcome.  Thanks a bunch.

Matt,

I'm afraid it is a general Unixism when you reconfigure the terminal 
driver.  Pine does not do anything explicitly to suck up keystrokes.

Thanks for the report!

Ian,

Sorry about the slow reply to this.  Unfortunately this apparently simple 
operation gets quite complicated behind the scenes.  If you have users 
who do this kind of thing routinely, you might consider converting to one 
of the alternate INBOX formats (e.g. Tenex) that allows shared concurrent 
access.

Thanks for the request!

Greetings,
	Just a quick question; Any rough estimate on when the next 
version of Pine will be ready, and any chance of a quick re-cap on what 
new features it will have?

	Thanks,

I had a user report that while he was in the addressbook he deleted an 
entry (the one and only) and then when he tried to create another, he got 
a pine "bug" message.  

I tried to reproduce the problem and finally did (it is very
intermittent).  After lots of deletes and adds in the addressbook, I got
the following error message (this is screen capture output):  

Any thoughts????? 

Thanks.

Paul,

This sounds like it may be a problem with NFS file locking when trying to 
write the sent-mail copy of the message.  The best way to avoid this 
problem is to install imapd on the ultrix box and configure Pine to 
use imap instead of NFS.

Thanks for the report!

Daniel,

There is a commercial implementation of IMAP for VMS available from
Innosoft.  They are rumored to be working on a Pine implementation for
VMS. I do not know of any IMAP implementations for MVS.  Here is the

I dont know how the average user feels about this but if we just wanted to
stick to the Yes/No answer format then I'd much rather have Pine ask me if
I want to overwrite the file. I use temp a lot too and I can't remember a
single time when i needed Pine to append a message to a file. Of course
there are probably LOTS of users who might disagree with me on this but
then again maybe not!?

Sherry,

Could you send us a compressed core file as an attachment?  If you run 
pine with the "-d9" option, duplicate the problem, and send us the 
.pine-debug2 file, that would also be helpful.

Thanks for the report!

David,

We do not have any sort of firm date, but we are shooting for a late 
spring release.  The features we have running internally include pipe, 
bounce, news posting/subscription, aggregate operations, and mailcap 
support.  I am not sure what other features will make it into the 
distribution yet.

Thanks for the request!

Jason,

We have made the PC and Unix versions of pine as close to the same as we 
can.  I'm not sure about the ease of compilation, but we distribute 
pre-compiled versions of PC-Pine for all of the currently supported 
TCP/IP stacks.

Thanks for the interest!

How can I invoke pine to open an X-window and refer to the icons in the
contrib directory?  "xterm -e pine" gets me the window but without the fancy
icon.

Would/is it be possible to have pine capable of looking up users to send 
mail to in the passwd file?  I.e.  When in compose, I would like to be 
able to bring up a list of all users on the local system with their full 
names and be able to select one as the destination.  It should work in 
similar manner to the personal directory lookup.  It is better however, 
because you would not have to update your own list and you will always 
get an up to date list.  Perhaps you can have a selection to pick from 
personal directory or global directory (on unix it would use passwd).

The idea of being able to pick local users out of the passwd file is 
excellent, but for a lot of educational sites that use NIS (commercial 
sites would be nuts to use NIS for security reasons, but that is another 
story).

Anyway, yeah. Great idea. Just support NIS if it is done!

Maybe so, but y'all managed to stick in ^Space, to skip *ahead* a word at 
a time.  I've asked about this before-- are there plans to add a "skip a 
word backwords" keystroke?  Just for us impatient editors... :-)  Pardon 
my key-mapping ignorance, but would the keys control-< and control-> be 
possible to use?  (Oh no, another keystroke change request!!!)

It should *really* be optional, as I can't imagine how it would be
useful for our University-wide systems, each of which has better than
60,000 local users.

Really.

I can just see users paging through 60,000/25 screens full of information.

Darryl,

Sorry about the slow response, we have been swamped!  PC-Pine will print 
to whatever the default printer is, so if you set up DOS so that one of 
the others is default, it should work.  

Thanks for the request!

I was thinking about this the other day.  I think PINE just needs
to make a programming interface.  Then each of us can write the
directory service to meet our own needs.  People with ones of
general interest like this passwd/NIS can submit it to the PINE
team.

I understand how this passwd idea would be good in some environments,
but in mine it is horrible as depending what machine someone was logged
into they would see different people in the addressbook....

Pine will be adding support for the IMSP protocol in the not-to-distant 
future.  A significant part of this protocol is devoted to an addressbook 
service.  The proposed c-client extensions for IMSP support include just 
the kind of API you are asking for.  Here is the latest draft announcement:

Anyone interested in discussing this API should subscribe to the
c-client@cac.washington.edu mailing list.  The admin address for the list
is c-client-request@cac.washington.edu.

Kari,

Sorry about the abysmally late response to this!  Pine does indeed use
standard CRLF line breaks.  I have heard of mail delivery software that
incorrectly converts the CRLF pairs to something else, but that should
affect all incoming MIME mail.  Let us know if you need further assistance
tracking down the problem. 

Thanks for the report!

Not really.  The next version of Pine will have a "Search for End" 
command, but that is about it so far.

Gregory,

Sorry about the slow response!  We've got your first suggestion on our 
list of enhancements to consider.  Your second suggestion os not really 
doable though.  You can most certainly have spaces in the fullname part 
of the address.  Even your address has spaces in it...

John,

This is a feature/bug of the current version of Pine that will be 
corrected in an upcoming version.  Thanks for the report!

What a novel idea...  An "alternate editor" function in an editor ;)

Seriously, when we re-work the spell checker in Pine, I would presume 
that the Pico spell checker will also get updated.  I suspect that this 
is quite far down the "master to-do list" though...

Thanks for the suggestion, Mike!

David,

What you need to find is a VT100 programmer's manual.  They are getting 
pretty hard to find, but there is bound to be someone over there who has 
a dusty copy on their bookshelf...

The next version of Pine will have a Pipe command, but it will feed back into
the same scrolltool() routine.  If you have mutiple screens (physical or
virtual) you should be able to come up with a clever way to make it work
though... 

Thanks for the requests!

Actually, this would really be great. Just simple programming hooks
that would allow us who can program to tailor items into Pine 
without having to modify actual source code in the distribution.

Also, if address book could do expansions, with same user interface
as folders, is "personal addressbook" "system addressbook" etc...

No problem.  There actually was a bug in the PMDF mail user agent under
VMS which caused it to display quoted-printable mail incorrectly.  I had a
hard time in convinving our VMS admin, but that's an entirely different
story :-) Upgrading PMDF fixed it.  Thanks for the reply anyway.

Hi! 

Is that possible to  add line and position counter on pico?   That will 
be helpful for people who use pico to write program.  Thanks!!

Henry,

^C will give you that information as a command.  I think it would be 
pretty crowded to put it in the header...

Thanks for the suggestion!

However, it only  tells you which line; it doesn't say which position.  
For example, for Fortran programmers, they need to know where is 7 and 70.

I don't know about this one ... it seems irrelevant for an integrated mail
editor to show line and column.  And Pico is *so* far off from being a
decent programmer's editor (that's not a problem, it just reflects Pico's
purpose) that adding line/column won't help. 

Just use Emacs, Henry ...

Is there a way to set expiration date on the emails
at the pine folder level? So emails within that folder
get deleted after number of given days.

I appreciate any info regarding this question,
Farzin

I believe there is a package called mailtool that will do this.

Hoping this helps,

Bounce, aka "resend" or "remail", will prompt you for one or more
addresses to resend the message to.  Upon arrival, the message will retain
the *originator's* From: line, rather than appearing to be from you.  So
replies by the final addressee will go back to the originator, unlike the
Forward case.  There will be "Resent-From:" and "Resent-To:"  headers
added to give the recipient a hint as to why they received it.  You will
not have an opportunity to edit or otherwise modify the message. 

The principle purpose of bounce is to re-direct mail that was 
mis-addressed or more appropriately sent elsewhere.  Another use is for 
list moderators to easily redirect candidate messages to the actual list.

I entirely disagree that enhancing the existing news funcionality of PINE
by implementing threading would either increase the complexity or make it
harder to use. 

For those who do not wish to utilise the news functionality it need not be
enabled, as now. For those who do, the single package for dealing with
both news and mail would make usage easier not more difficult. There
would not be the requirement to learn a whole set of different commands
for a separate package (eg trn). 

I would think that implementing threading which extended to mail as well
as news would be enthusiastically received by all who have actually used a
threaded mail reader (and would be a new delight to those who havn't).

We are talking here about a package that already has much of the
functionality of a news utility. I use PINE to look at news from time to
time, but the absence of threading make it hard work.(Even harder for a
novice). Threading of mail would make for a much easier system for novices
to get to grips with. I use a threaded mail/news system so speak from
experience.

If you think about it, we're not reinventing the wheel. What we're 
actually doing is enabling the PINE's existing news functionality to be 
used more powerfully, especially by novice users.

I use and administrate all these readers from time to time and I think
that asking a novice to cope with the range of options available under eg.
trn is asking a lot. 

PINE has been developed so that it's very easy for new users to pick up
and use, yet has advanced functionality that those of us who know where to
look can utilise. Asking a novice user to use trn is on a par with asking
him to use vi as his mail editor (IMHO).

In the DOS arena there are a number of news and mail utilities. Most that
I have encountered are good. 

>From home I use a dialup SLIP with winsock under windows to access
Internet with a combined news and mail utility which is threaded. It makes
the facilities available within most UNIX mail and news offerings I've
implemented and encountered appear crude and cumbersome. (And I'm a UNIX 
devotee who LOVES vi!).

When PC-PINE has a winsock implementation AND threads mail and news I'll
think carefully about changing my personal setup. 

I want my users to have a system that's simple in concept to understand
and not a kludge of disparate applications doing essentially the same job. 

Hence my request to extend the existing news functionality of PINE by 
threading. (That's all I asked), because I think the PINE team have got 
the balance between funtionality and ease of use right.

I await the pleasure with antici..............................pation. It's
refreshing to find somebody who actually knows the needs of their primary
target audience. Just thread your mail as well as news (optionally for
those who like difficult news reading?) and you'll be dead centre! 

As has been said, there are plenty of monolithic newsreaders (And good
they are too for those that can afford the time and think it worthwhile to
master them) so you're right not to make another one (IMHO).

Sorry if I wasn't clear that I'm only asking for this in the PC version of

I agree with having Pine have SIMPLE newsreading capabilities, for the 
following reasons:

1: some sites (e.g. this one) do not have a newsreader, even rn, 
available so it's pine or nothing (and as Ilan acknowledges, for PCs this 
is pretty much true too)

2: as a recent novice user of rn I found it extremely hard to get the hang
of, and this had put me off making the effort to learn to use it for ages
- Pine makes it easy enough to start that the user can soon find out
whether it's for them or not - and if it is can get some appreciation of
the value of features like threading and know a bit of what to look for 
in a 'real' newsreader.

And I don't think it has to make Pine difficult to use - the present
newsreading (which only works for me on unix version 3.0something, not the
PC version for some reason :-( ) doesn't change the Pine user interface
one jot, and is so much easier than rn that if I could kill or follow a
thread I'd want for nothing else. 

(Actually I'd like to see killing and threading in pine for MAIL, but
that's another story...)

Practically the only difference is the IMAP logon IF your Unix version 
doesn't use IMAP and IF you don't have PCPINE store your password - 
otherwise you might never know the difference.

Except when PCPINE runs out of memory, falls over and waves its little 
legs in the air! :-)

Oh and PC - 'compile' - what's a compiler? ;-)
Installation is as easy/pig-awful-difficult as any other PC application - 
i.e. a real pain first time, then OK once you know how. (I gave up on the 
soi-disant PCNFS version - not even any documentation to tell you why it 
doesn't work! - but the packet driver version works fine. If you're not 
using packet drivers .... tough!

Well John, I think it's all part of the same story - and very central to
the plot ;-)

That's the argument I'm trying to make, anyway...

One of many good reasons for having threaded mail (as well as news):

The use of threading in mail means that excessive quoting of preceding 
articles in a thread is rendered unnecessary. This should reduce the 
load on the Internet, make mail easier to read and reduce space taken on 
disk by stored messages.

I'm not too sure about killing mail. I use kill files to kill the body of
large news articles eg. those in bin group, so I can fetch later if the
header looks interesting. 

(Also to avoid articles written by known abusives, drivel generators or
those with signatures that take up half a page: please excuse my
rantings). 

In the case of mail, killing is a fairly final action! Better not IMHO
because you can't fetch a killed mail article later if you change your
mind or set the template such that it's killed accidentally (very likely 
with novice users).
 
I'm certainly a member of the KISS camp, and agree with the sentiments of 
the rest of your article. I'm not denegrating trn, I use it daily and 
it's good and fast. But inflicting it on novices?

BTW

Martin,
No need to start a signature campaign... threading has been part of the 
plan since we first started thinking about news support (a long time ago)!

However, threading may not make it into the upcoming release, and the
first iteration may be "poor man's" threading based on a Subject sort...
but whatever is there will certainly apply to both news and mail. 

We have *not* thought about adding kill files, though I confess I've seen a 
few messages that tempt me mightily :)

For the record: the next Pine release will include news posting and
subscription/unsubscription, plus a bunch of other stuff like mailcap
support.  Threading, etc, is in the works, but I don't know exactly when
it will be ready.

  Problem was, an empty addressbook and the user pressing "C".  He 
thought "C" was to create (but it really is ComposeTo).  Because there 
were no addresses to ComposeTo, pine crashed.   Here is the response from 
David Miller, Pine development team:

When I read news via the Pine interface, the items I have finished with 
and or deleted continue to show up in my list, even days later and many 
log ons later...  Currently, I go into my .newsrc and change the last 
item read reference so they stop showing up in Pine.

Any suggestions on how to delete news items from Pine?

Thomas,
Given a .pinerc entry something like this:
 news-collections=News *{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}[*]
and a .newsrc in my home directory on the same machine where Pine is 
running, you should find that any news article marked as Deleted
causes your .newsrc to be updated (in the same manner that other 
newsreaders would "mark as read").

Unfortunately, the current version of Pine does not know how to eXclude 
those messages from the Index view (stay tuned for the next release),
but the "D" status should be remembered across sessions by virtue of the
.newsrc info.

If that is not happening, we'll need more info to help...

Hello,

one of our user told me today and I verified that pine is not able to 
reply to addresses like 
Lastname.firstname=hostname%hack1%hack2@mailhost.domain

The To: field stays empty. You can add this address to your addressbook 
but if you want to use the nickname, the To: gets replaced by an empty 
string. I know that the %hack is no correct address, but it is still 
used and my user was sad that she couldn't respond to her sender.

Typing this kind of address directly into the To: field is possible and 
the mail gets delivered.

Kind Regards
Guenter

Good News!  When I checked this, that is exactly what is happening -- my
.newsrc IS being updated!

Thanks for clarifying, and keep up the great work on Pine!

A very good point Richard, but not strictly true ;)

If I send mail or news without excessive quoting then that will reduce 
network traffic whether or not the recipient has a threaded mail or news 
reader. 

The hope is that in order to follow threads efficiently the recipient will
get a threaded reader and the usage of threaded readers will grow like
wildfire. Network traffic due to mail and news will be reduced by 90% and
everything in the garden will be rosy. Could this be the real world?

But I'm sure I'm preaching to the converted ;)

I've probably generated enough noise on the subject for now... so I'll
shut up. This is not the right venue for this type of discussion I think,
apologies to all if I got carried away.

Not using that syntax, of course, but I'd like to be able to tell pine to 
*prompt* me for a folder name in which to save outgoing messages.  As it 
is, I have to periodically run through sent-mail in order to move the 
messages to the folders in which I really want to store them.

David,

We are planning to implement a FCC-folder-name-rule similar to the 
saved-msg-name-rule in a future release.  Will this be good enough?  You 
can already change the Fcc: by editing the header before sending...

Thanks for the suggestion!

I have never had this work for me with Unix Pine 3.88 - it just says 
	[ ** Empty List ** select here to try Re-Expanding ]
and with PC-PINE 3.89 it hangs the PC :-(.

I can read news with 3.07 using the *newsgroup way of selecting groups.
Is it me or Pine?

BTW I think the line you've shown is wrong - surely the =News *{...
>  news-collections=News *{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}[*]
should be =*{... ??

My .pinerc has:
	news-collections=*{mercury/nntp}[*]
and assuming that 3.07 also reads .pinerc then I think it's correct.

John,

What application wrote your .newsrc?  How many groups are subscribed?  If 
you send a copy of your .pinerc and .newsrc files to 
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu we will take a look and see if we can 
duplicate the problem.  

The "News " is an optional nickname for the collection that will be 
displayed on the FOLDER LIST screen.

Thanks for the report!

I'm not sure if this topic has been covered, but....

It seems to me that whatever method I use to get to the compose message 
screen, I should still get a warning about the postponed message (if it 
exists).  As it is, this only happens if I press "C" to compose, but not 
if I use the forward or reply function.  Can this be fixed?

Maybe.  I'll be able to set it to something like "last-folder-used" 
and it will prompt me with that as the default before doing the actual save?

I think I can get into the habit of using rich headers and filling in the 
FCC line, but an (optional) automatic prompt would sure be easier.

Hmm.  Actually, a feature-list command to make rich headers the default,
or better yet a variable to allow me to select the list of default compose
headers, combined with default-FCC = "" would make me even happier, I
think. 

But thanks for reminding me about the extra headers.  That will 
instaneously make my life easier <grin>.

I don't think there will be an extra prompt, it will just change the 
default that is put in the FCC: header.

We are looking into various ways of implementing this.  People have been
requesting just about every possible combination of headers to show by
default.  This problem is just going to multiply with the News headers
added ;)

Guenter,

Pine should be able to handle that form of address without any problem. 
Could you send a message that exhibits this problem to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu as an attachment? 

Thanks for the report!

I think I would find that behavior very annoying.  Usually if I am 
replying or forwarding a message I do not want to be distracted by a 
previously interrupted message.  The downside of the current behavior is 
what to do when you already have a message postponed and you want to 
postpone another one.  This will be addressed when we add support for 
multiple postponed messages....

David,

I see your point, and I understand that the pine team will consider this. 
I suppose I can wait until the multiple postponed messages support is
added.  :-)

However, I'd just like to mention that most of the mail I compose is
a reply to someone else's mail.  Personally, I think of all the
methods of starting the composer essentially the same, except that the
different information may already be filled in.  If I were just giving
simple "Yes", "No", or "Here is the info you requested" answers, then I
would find the behavior annoying.  Frankly, I found it annoying at first
when I used the simple "compose" command-- but I got used to it.  I think
it is a fair request to allow the user to postpone *any* message s/he
composes, no matter what command was used to fire up the editor. 

Thanks for the consideration!

Regards,
	Elmar

Hi,

Do you know how I can change automatic line breaking column ?
I would like to have narrower letters and now I have to use
"Enter" a lot.

Is it possible to automaticly justify letters in such way that each
line is filled up to line breaking point ?

How can I change character for included messages (>) ?

Thanks in advance,
Kacper

Hi:

I have just installed pine-3.89 and a user reports getting the message:

	MAIL FOLDER  "INBOX" CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR

followed by it deleteing all of this person's new mail, which I assume means 
the unread mail in /usr/spool/mail/foo.  Have I built pine incorrectly.  
Thanks.

	Well you *can* postpone messages that you reply to.  The only
problem is that you are still limited to *one* postponed message, If the
pine development team implemented multiple postpones, then your problem
would, in the main, be solved, wouldn't it?

Kacper,

Pine does not currently have a way to change the wrap column.  A hack that
will make Pine use shorter lines is to run "stty cols 70" or some such
before entering Pine.  This will cause it to think the screen is actually
narrower than it is and thus break on shorter lines.  The drawback of this
is that Pine uses the narrower width for everything... 

We plan to improve the justification done by the composer.  I don't know 
when/if we will implement full justification though...

There is not currently an option to change the '>' character.  This is on
the list of requested enhancements.

(Boink!) I was referring to postponing a message when there was already
one postponed.  If the multiple postpones feature is coming in the next
release, then my question is moot anyway. :-) I basically just want the
warning about a previously postponed message ***every*** time you start a
new message.  I know that normally you wouldn't want to continue your
previous message if you were doing a reply (well, that's debatable), but
if you start a message and *can't* postpone it, I think it's fair that you
be told.  8-D

I was playing around with some Pine configurations and discovered that 
there is no mechanism for remote addressbooks or remote signature files. 
Being an admin for two separate sites, I would find such mechanisms very 
useful. Given that IMAP is used to centralize one's mail collections, I 
would think it generally useful to centralize the addressbook and 
signature file within Pine as well if it's possible.

Jeff,

Both of these are indeed coming.  The biggest holdup is getting the IMAP4 
specification out the door so we can put together the tools we need to 
handle remote files cleanly.

Thanks for the request!

-bm is not a valid comand line option for xterm.  I was able to get it to 
work using "xterm -name Pine -e pine" with the following line added to 
my .Xdefaults file:

(I seem to remember something about this coming up here recently, but I
can't see it in the last few hundred messages I've scanned....)

If I receive a message with an attachment (e.g. from David L Miller with a
sample .newsrc) and want to reply ("thanks David, that works") I don't
want to return the attachment - can I remove it? 

I can delete the Attchmnt: line in the header, but does that do it? I
tried that and found that when I postponed the message I was warned that
the attachment would not be saved - suggesting that it was still there,
and I'd just deleted the attachment comment; but also suggesting a
workaround - to postpone and then resume the reply (assuming I hadn't
already postponed another composition!).

John,

When you delete the last attachment, Pine does not realize that it should 
"downgrade" the message type to a simple message.  We will correct this 
in a future release of Pine.

Thanks for the report!

  I believe the '-bm' option is a local hack to xterm that is not 
supported in the 'normal' X11 R5 xterm client.

I'm sure this is a FAQ - is there a way of displaying the full headers in 
a received message?

I am attempting to convert over from emacs RMAIL to pine since it has 
better support for folders, addressing, and other goodies.  However, I 
can't get over the urge to be able to expunge mail while reading 
messages (not from the index).  RMAIL's behavior was that while viewing a 
message, the expunge command would expunge all mail in the folder and 
display the first message not expunged.  In pine, I must go back to the 
mail index and then do the expunge.

I rely on expunge because I generally don't like to keep any mail in my 
INBOX so that xbiff reflects no new mail.

John,

Yes, the 'H' command will give them to you.  Actually, it gives you the
raw message in all its gorey detail.  You need to have
enable-full-header-cmd set in the feature-list in your .pinerc file to
enable this command. 

Thanks for the request!

This is a known problem, but unfortunately we are thus far unable to

Elmar and John,

these are reasonable requests, and we will certainly keep them in mind. 
The problem is that we have far more good suggestions than we have keys
available.  We also want to be very careful that the keys we define are
generally available on all platforms.  We have already cut the margin
pretty close with some of our current choices, e.g. ^O, ^J, ... 

Thanks for the suggestions!

Subject: Problems "pasting" in Windows.

I'm using PINE (on an office Unix machine) from home.  I use ProComm Plus
for Windows to get into PINE.  All works great except that I cannot
paste material from the Windows clipboard through ProCOmm+ into PINE
without the lines wrapping.  For instance, the following lines in the 
clipboard:
 
  This is line 1.
  This is line 2.
  This is line 3.
 
ends up in PINE as:
 
  This is line 1. This is line 2. This is line 3.
 
I've tried changing all the CR, CR/LF switches in ProComm+ to no
avail.  Do you have a suggestion?

I have seen identical behaviour after spending a long time in the 
alternative editor composing a message.  This was under SunOS 4.1.2 on an 
ELC.  Pine version 3.89.

I assume that Pine is simply wait(2)'ing for the editor.  It may be possible
for it to do this in the select loop for the IMAP connection, trapping a
child-signal when the editor terminates.

Making all _Pico_ keybindings user-configurable would surely answer complaints
about Pico vs Emacs.  NOrmally users wouldn't have to touch their keybindings.

I was trying to use PC-Pine as an offline mailreader, so I download one of 
the network versions that was at ftp.cac.washington.edu.  For some
reason the PC-Pine doesn't recognize the unix mail folders that I 
downloaded as a valid mail folder.  Does the PC-Pine use a different
format for its mail folders and is there a way to convert unix mail
folders to PC?  Thanx

John,

My .pinerc (Not on compcg) has:

news-collections=Internet-News *{compcg.demon.co.uk}[]

Hope this helps.

	I get this on my sun - I have a screen saver that I think blocks
	update till it exits, so if it runs overnight pine fills up the
	output buffer, then blocks until I get in in the morning.

	In the meantime the imapd gets tired of waiting :)

	Not much I can do about this I guess except switch screen savers!

	Every public terminal (sun/PC) at this site has PageUp/PageDown,
	and also seperate delete/backspace keys... (Also Home & End)

	Some thoughts on keys...

	On an Xterm PageUp & PageDown work fine in pico, but not in the
	index, and not at all in pico. It would be *REALLY* nice if 
	they would work all the time! Home & End would be nice too!
	
	Also, an option to make Delete work the same as ^D, possibly in the
	.pinerc? I know this would be bad news for people on genuine DEC
	terminals, but if you make it settable via options, or even only
	via .pinerc so novices dont muck it up?

	What do people think?

I sometimes wonder what would be the effect of large scale usage of IMAP
clients as opposed to SMTP/POPx clients since IMAP is connection oriented
and SMTP/POPx is connectionless oriented.

Take the case of a University (say) with X thousand mail users and a single
mail server.

Now I figure if everyone used an SMTP/POPx client the system would cope
fairly well. If though everyone used an IMAP client I figure the system
would clog.

I have no proof or evidence for this. It is just something I feel in my bones.

Anyone had experience of large scale usage of IMAP clients?

I believe Pico is a "down-sized" (demolished?) MicroEmacs. Since you can't
please all the people all the time (PC users will want wordprocessor-like
things, Unix users will want emacs/vi-like things) why not get Pico to
look for/obey a .emacsrc file and be done with it. 

Dare I add that for most Pine users (that I know) configurability is a
pretty arcane area.

Andre -

     Mike Roch forwarded your questions about IMAP vs POP performance to me.
It seems that you have several misconceptions, which I hope I can clarify.

     There is no ``IMAP vs SMTP'' issue.  Like POP clients, IMAP clients use
SMTP for mail delivery.  Actually some POP clients may use an undocumented
extension feature in some POP servers to deliver mail without using SMTP, so
one could say the issue is ``SMTP/IMAP vs POP''.  However, it is generally a
bad idea to use an access protocol such as POP or IMAP to deliver mail (a long
description of why this is so is in the IMAP4 draft document).

     It is incorrect to think of POP as being ``connectionless''.  POP is as
much a connection-oriented protocol as IMAP is.  The difference is that for
the most part you use POP to download all messages from the server to the
client, delete from the server, and close the connection.  IMAP permits this
mode of operation, but also offers a mode in which you manipulate data on the
server without having to download the entire mail folder (which implies
keeping the connection open).

     IMAP servers, in general, use remarkably little CPU time.  Depending upon
folder format, my implementation may need some virtual memory (note the word
``virtual'' -- it tolerates being paged out quite nicely) but even that isn't
necessarily the case; one folder format is quite a miser on system resources.

     We have NEVER observed a system being overloaded because of IMAP servers.
In general, long before the system runs out of resources to handle IMAP
servers, you run into trouble due to other reasons related to a overlarge user
population; inadequate disk space, lock contention between sendmail processes,
access to /tmp, etc.  In fact, sendmail will drag such a system to its knees
long before IMAP servers will.

     This isn't to say that there is no cost differential between IMAP and
POP.  There is.  However, the concerns expressed tend to be overblown.  Most
IMAP users are likely to be mobile users, who would otherwise log in to the
server system as a timesharing user.  An IMAP server is ALWAYS less costly
than a user mail program run on that system.  That is, a user running PC Pine
to a UNIX based server causes MUCH LESS of a load on that server than by
running UNIX Pine on the UNIX machine.

Is there any way to change the DEFAULT editor in pine, so that it 
automatically puts me into (say, ) emacs whenever I would otherwise be 
put in pine?

Barry and Carolynn,

The latest version of the IMAP distribution contains improved process
management code that will hopefully solve or improve this problem.  If you
would like to try it, get mail/imap.tar.Z from ftp.cac.washington.edu.  
This distribution may also be substituted for the imap subtree of Pine 
3.89 if you really want to be on the cutting edge.  NOTE, this code is 
still considered experimental and has not been extensively tested on some 
platforms!

Thanks for the report!

Ami,

No, you have to explicitly invoke the alternate editor from the 
composer.  We are considering an option to automatically invoke the 
alternate editor when you move the cursor from the headers to the body of 
the message, but that is about as far as we will probably go.

Thanks for the request!

Andrew,

The problem is that user-configurable keybindings make for a customer 
support nightmare!  If you want Pico with configurable keys, get EMACS ;)

Thanks for the suggestion!

Joshua,

Yes, PC-Pine does use a different folder format.  The next version of 
Unix Pine will include support for the MTX format used in PC-Pine, but 
that is only a small part of making Pine a reasonable offline mail 
reader.  We will be working on the necessary changes over the next 
few releases of Pine.

Thanks for the request!

1.  Is there a way in pine to define "user" headers, such as Reply-To: 
and Return-Receipt-To:, so they will be included on an out-going message. 
In 'elm' and 'mush', you can create user-definable headers.  If not, any 
plans in the future???

2.  Can you include other messages while composing a message?  For 
example, I am composing a message to "jay" and want to include message 34 
and 56 from my INBOX in this message.  Is there a way to "easily" do this?

Thanks - From a converted MUSh user.

Sherry,

The next release of Pine will definitely include the Reply-To: header.  
We are still working out the mechanisms to allow user-defined headers in 
a reasonable way.  Currently, the only way to include multiple messages 
in an outgoing message is to export them to a file and read them into or 
attach them to the new composition.  The next version of Pine will at 
least start to simplify that procedure.

Thanks for the requests!

Sherry,
Both of these are on the "shorter" list of requested enhancements.
Too soon to say *exactly* what will make it into the next release, though.

I got the following message from pine when looking at a message sent from 
meuf:

    [The following text is in the "iso-8879-1" character set]
    [Your display is set for the "ISO-8859-1" character set]
    [Some characters may be displayed incorrectly]

A case-insentive comparison certainly seems reasonable, no?

I'm using Pine 3.07 on a SunOS 4.1.2 UNIX box.

Occasionally, I get mail with just headers and no message. I usually
figure, "Oh, this guy sent something out by mistake" or whatever, but one
time I hit the "H" key to see the full headers, and lo and behold, a
message appeared at the bottom out of thin air. A look at the headers
revealed this: 

Content-Type: MULTIPART/MIXED; BOUNDARY="Boundary (ID mMUBo+QQrtWQIXsCyCqPSw)"

as one of the headers. What is happening here? When I don't have "full
headers" on, it looks like the message is completely blank, and when I
turn the headers on, it looks like a normal mail (with lots of headers).

Chris,

The comparison *is* case insensitive, but note that '7' is not the same as
'5' in either case... ;)

Thanks for the report!

A case-insensitive comparison is reasonable, but not a numeric-insensitive
comparison (note 8879 vs 8859).  I think that 8879 is an error on the part of
whomever sent the message.

Adam,

It looks like Pine is seeing a MIME message, but is not able to correctly 
parse it as such.  This is often caused by not having the required blank 
line between the header and body of the message.  Or, the boundaries 
between parts may not be in quite the expected form, etc.

My first recommendation would be to upgrade to Pine 3.89.  If Pine 3.89 
still cannot read the problem messages, send us a copy of one of them as 
an attachment and we will figure out what the problem is.

Thanks for the report!

Hello.  Please save a message which demonstrates this problem to a file, and
then mail that file to us (pine@cac.washington.edu) as a Pine attachment.
We'll analyze it figure out if it's a bug in our stuff, or if the message is
badly-formed MIME.  If the former, we'll fix the bug; if the latter, we'll get
in touch with the sender so he can fix his bug.

Even so it would not match.  See "8879" vs "8859". :-)

I run Pine from an xterm with the following line in my .xinitrc on Suns 
running SunOS 4.1.3:

/usr/local/x11r5/bin/xterm -geometry 87x24--1-8 -e pine &

Every time I quit Pine in this case, it dumps core. Anybody else notice 
this behavior? Know what's causing it?

Elmar,

Sorry about the late reply.  The ideal behavior would be for Pine to know 
that the folder was read-only and to not attempt to get write access.  
Unfortunately, there is currently no mechanism for this except for the 
first folder opened, in which case you can use "-o" on the command line.  

Perhaps the following would work in your .pinerc:

	inbox-path={develop}/home/develop/compute/incoming
	incoming-folders=Personal /usr/spool/mail/$USER

Then set up pine as an alias to "pine -o".

I hope this helps!

Jeff,

Try the following in your .xinitrc:

 /usr/local/x11r5/bin/xterm -geometry 87x24--1-8 -e pine.sh &

pine.sh:

	#!/bin/sh
	pine
	sleep 1

This gets around a timing race that currently occurs with Pine run in a 
Sun xterm.

Thanks for the report!

Your xterm has to sleep to give pine a chance to exit...

Do this...

/usr/local/x11r5/bin/xterm -geometry 87x24--1-8 -e xpine.csh &

-----xpine.csh-----
#!/bin/csh -f
/usr/local/bin/pine
sleep 2



Hope it helps...

Later...

Lawrence,

The message ``Folder format invalidated (consult an expert), aborted'' means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it expected
a start-of-message header line, it found something else.

The start-of-message header line is in the form:
	From smith@blurdybloop.com Wed Feb 23 11:43:10 PST 1994
There are variations in the format of the date and time.

The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways:
 1) bad data exists at the beginning of the folder.
 2) data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and the new
    data did not begin with a start-of-message-header.
 3) the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it.

All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine.

Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats itself
after restarting Pine.  If restarting Pine does not make the problem go away,
then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see what is wrong
with the very first line.  In particular, make sure that the first character
of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the third an
``o'', etc.

Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail) which
writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the new data.

Condition (3) is caused by some program manipulating the mail folder without
following the Pine folder locking protocol.  This is a general problem on
UNIX.

Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing folders
via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read() system calls do
not correspond with each other as a result of NFS buffer caching.

Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3).  If the
problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its cause.
Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.  The reason
why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does not want to risk
damaging user data by guessing what is right.  Pine never writes to the folder
unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is doing.

There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these conditions
coming up.  Some of these steps may require the assistance of your system
adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine on your
system):
 1) Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders.  This is perhaps the
    single most important cause of user difficulties.
 2) Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine.  If the mbox driver is enabled,
    mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a file called mbox
    in your home directory, if mbox exists.  The home directory mbox file is
    then your INBOX.  This has the advantage that Pine and the mail delivery
    system are never in contention for the INBOX.  Pine only empties the
    /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries updating it.
 3) Be careful not to run other programs that access your folders while you
    are running Pine.  Such programs may modify the folder from under Pine,
    and lead Pine to conclude that there is a problem.


Thanks for the report!

Mark,

Thanks for the nice words!  We have recently recieved word of two separate
VMS pine ports by outside contributors, so the VMS people may not be out in
the cold forever... 

It does not look like offline support will make it into the next release 
of Pine, but we are hoping to get something put together soon.  We also 
plan to implement multiple addressbook support soon.

Thanks for the requests!

Honestly, what works for me 99% of the time is to load it into dmail (or 
equivalent), do something to it which causes dmail to rewrite the 
mailbox, exit dmail, and re-run pine.

Dear Pine Team,

I am a happy Pine user.  Congratulations on developing an easy and useful=
=20
mail handler.  But  (compliments are often followed by buts)

1.  Is it (or could it be made) possible to have the Receipt Time recorded
in the header of incoming messages, as well as the Date and time of
dispatch?  Sometimes messages are received in a different chronological
order from that of their dispatch, and it would be useful to have this
information recorded.=20

2.  Is it (or could it be made) possible to bring in another message during
a Reply (i.e., other than the message being Replied to)?  The only way I
can see to do this at present is to export that message to a file, and
then read it into the reply.  But that means anticipating that the message
will be needed;  if not, the Reply must be postponed while the export is
done.=20

I look forward to your comments.

Graham de Vahl Davis

Graham,

The Berkeley mailbox format (default on most systems) includes the date=20
and time recieved on the internal "From " that precedes each message. =20
However, if you "save" a message, that date and time will be updated with=
=20
the date and time saved.

A future version of Pine will include a capability to include a message=20
directly...

Thanks for the requests!
