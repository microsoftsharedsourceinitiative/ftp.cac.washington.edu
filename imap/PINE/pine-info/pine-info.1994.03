I have done a lot of work lately on the "Pine Motif version" and it is
something like 95% ready. It will have about the same functionality as
pine 3.89, with minor exceptions. I am implementing some of the currently
missing features, such as 'pipe' and 'zoom' commands, but then I probably
will leave the compose editor (pico will not be used) at a very
rudimentary stage, as everyone probably has their own favorite Motif
editor anyway (which can be invoked conveniently, of course). 

I hope I can get my current work into a polished enough stage to do an
initial 'beta-release' within March -94. I will continue work with this
project though, as it has proven very interesting and I have many ideas I 
want to implement. 

I will ftp a file called 'NokiaPine.beta.tar.Z' into incoming directory of
some strategic ftp archives throughout the net (such as
ftp.cac.washington.edu) and mail a release notice into 'pine-info' list,
when it's ready. The tar will contain K&R C-sources, a makefile and
documents. The makefile will work on HP9000/730, HP/UX 9.01 with its
standard configuration (cc, libXm, libX11, libXt installed). Same unix 
platforms can be supported as pine 3.89 does (with os-??? files in 
pine/osdep directory). You must have Motif 1.2 and X11R5.

I will keep makefile simple enough to make 'porting' to other platforms
than HP730 a piece of cake. There will not be an imakefile. I will assume
that 'pine3.89.tar.Z' is already installed too, at least the c-client
library will be needed from there. 

The program will be called initially 'NokiaPine' and it will be
distributed under the same terms as pine itself. I will have the
copyright on my part of the work, UW on their part, Dave Taylor on his,
etc. What you can compile, you can use, and it's free...

NokiaPine will be targeted primarily for 'power-user' audience, although
even novices should find the GUI rather friendly to use too (if not a bit
confusing though). NokiaPine will be 100% compatible with pine 3.89, you
can use both side by side. NokiaPine will require a very powerful machine 
with plenty of RAM to run (NokiaPine uses 6-10 Mbytes when you fire up all 
the windows there are, pine 3.89 uses 3-4 Mbytes).

There will probably be some controversy over the way I have implemented
certain user-interface related features. We'll see what kind of debate
evolves out of that ;-)

With some additional restructuring of the code, the Tcl/Tk package could 
be integrated into NokiaPine, thus providing an easy 'programmer's 
interface' to allow extensive customizing.
I will explore this possibility more, later this spring and summer.

Dear Pine-Team

After using unix-pine for a while I'm now trying to establish PC-PINE.
Some users will connect to the Server via telephone modem, using SLIP
and PC/TCP.

1. Is it possible for them to extract their INBOX with one (or two) 
   keystrokes into a local folder and then quit the SLIP session?

   When I tried to invoke PC-PINE without PC/TCP up and running
   I got an error message and PC-PINE aborted.

   I would like to invoke PC-PINE for reading purposes without the need
   of having a connection to the smtp-server.
   If I could even compose messages in this mode, which would be sent
   at the next invocation of PC-PINE and PC/TCP running, this would be 
   great!

Martin,

These features are all planned.  Unfortunately they are not available 
yet.  Thanks for the request!

Wojtek,

Sorry about the delayed reply.  Pine does use the information from the 
passwd file if it thinks it is safe to do so.  If you have the 
user-domain variable set in either your system pine.conf file or your 
.pinerc file, that value must match either the full value or the domain 
that it would use without the variable set.  Typically, placing the fully 
qualified host name first in the /etc/passwd file will make the system 
return the expected value.

Thanks for the request!

How can I send a message to someone at Compuserve?

Typing their user id - of the form 1stnumber,2ndnumber@compuserve.com - 
pine thinks it is two addresses - 1stnumber@local domain and 
2ndnumber@compuserve.com

Quoting the string doesn't seem to help.

John,

I think that you have to use a dot instead of a comma:

1stnumber.2ndnumber@compuserve.com

Mail to Compuserve by changing the comma between the two parts of the 
compuserve address to a period. That way mailers see it as one address. 
When CS gets it, it maps the period over to the comma and delivers the 
mail. So, 12345,4545 becomes 12345.4545@compuserve.com

Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding of what happens is the 
following.  When I enter an address that is local (i.e. dryfoos) Pine 
goes to the passwd file and grabs the full name -- 
James Dryfoos <dryfoos@deneb>

What I want, is to be able to do a control-t and scan through all the 
names on the local system (passwd or equivalent) and be able to select 
one.  Currently, I have to know what the local address is -- at least, 
when I get it right, I get the full name added (confirmation).  This has 
come up because I just started working in a new place and do not know 
everyone's address yet (cannot even add them to my own directory without 
first knowing them).

Hi...I'm new...I'm put in charge of writing the documentation for pine at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign...


Anyway....

When writing a compuserve address, just change the commas to periods and
you'll be fine....

Ahhh, OK.  A future version of Pine will have an extended driver-based 
mechanism for handling addressbooks.  Once this is in place it would 
presumably be possible to write a driver to use the passwd file like a 
read-only addressbook.  

Thanks for the clarification!

I have a question concerning the choice of sendmail arguments that PINE
uses.  

For incoming mail, I added -ox4X8 to the normal args which makes 
my sendmail daemon slows down after the load goes to 4 and stops 
taking connections when the load goes to 8.  But this does not effect 
local mail.

Is there anything I can change to PINE's sendmail args so it will 
act differently under heavy load?

What causes my problem is that I have a lot of large email
lists and when mail is sent out via PINE to one of those lists, my load
goes up.  When 3 or 4 people do this at the same time, my load gets
ridiculous. 

If I can do nothing with PINE would listserv software handle the load better?

Thanks for your help.

The sendmail flags that Pine uses are set in pine/osdep/os-???.h.  The 
default entry is:

	#define SENDMAILFLAGS   "-oi -oem -t"

On one of our big systems that sometimes has over 1000 Pine sessions open 
we finally had to configure a second machine as an SMTP server and set 
the smtp-server variable in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf to point to it.  
This eliminates all of the sendmail calls for messages on other machines 
and about half the calls for local mail.  Let us know if you find any 
exceptional solutions!

Thanks for the request!

Elmar,

We have just found the bug that was causing this.  The problem was that 
we were failing to copy the information out of a library static buffer 
before another call to the routine.  This bug will be fixed in the next 
release of Pine.

Thanks for the report!

Elmar,
Just to clarify further: this bug was related to changing passwords 
during a Pine session.

i am a new user of pine and my first problems are..
i cant use h ( full header mode )
i want to name and nickname the addresses i ve listed under the name of a 
group, so i can mail them individually withouth having to store the same 
address twice. I d also like if i had multiple addressbooks...
i also want to read and post my newsgroups through pine...
if i could the same with gopher, it would be great...

Thanx in advance.

which should cause mail sent with this flag to be queued instead of
being immediately delivered. The mail is then delivered on the
next queue run (-q30m, e.g.). During a queue run queued mail is
processed serially. Serializing delivery smooths out the load.

Ippokratis,

You need to add "enable-full-header-cmd" to the "feature-list=" line in 
your .pinerc file to enable the 'H' command.

When you make a distribution list in the addressbook, you can list the 
nicknames you used for individual entries.  Then you do not have to worry 
about typing the full address twice.  Is that what you are asking for?

Support for multiple addressbooks and news posting will be coming in future
releases of Pine.  Support for gopher is probably much further away. 

Thanks for the requests!

Dear Pine List,
	I have one problem with SunOS 4.1.3 and PINE, when I post mail to 
"local system", the header is :

>From isma@aguila.dgsca.unam.mx Thu Mar  3 11:47:27 1994

To: Isaias Callejas <isma@aguila.dgsca.unam.mx>            |
Subject: test						   L>the same address.


	When I use "mail" command to post local mail the header is :

>From isma@aguila.dgsca.unam.mx Thu Mar  3 11:53:35 1994
Date: Thu, 3 Mar 94 11:46:13 CST
From: isma@aguila.dgsca.unam.mx
To: isma@aguila
Subject: test from mail..

	When I post mail to others systems it is fine (well, I believe it):

	Any idea???

Is there a reason that the Content-Description header is printed on all

Two things:

First, it would be nice if display of the parts of a multipart/digest
message showed the subject line rather than the string "Attached Text". 
(Also, it should show the subject line in the Parts/Attachments "header.")

Second, any Content-Transfer-Encoding header in the individual parts appears 
to be ignored.

Isaias,

I suspect that the sendmail program on your system is re-writing the "From:"
header on some of your mail and not getting it quite right.  The "From:"
header that Pine generates should be identical on all messages.  Compare the
headers on the messages below with the headers on the copies in your
sent-mail folder to confirm this.  One thing you can try is to set the 
"smtp-server" variable in your .pinerc file.  You can specify just about 
any Unix system as the smtp-server, so you might experiment with a few to 
see if they behave differently.

I hope that helps!

Ippokraths,

There are indeed a few commands that did not get implemented in Pine
3.88/3.89.  They will be available in the next release.  Sorry about any
confusion this has caused. 

Thanks for the report!

Now that we have a new-server whose response is fast enough to make the 
experiments bearable, I have been trying out PINE (PC and unix) as a 
newsreader. Compared to my standard newsreaders (trumpet on the PC and rn 
on unix) I far prefer the user interface, with one exception:

both the others skip newsgroups which have no new items; 
what I would like PINE to do ideally would be to skip to next with some 
new items; if this is hard, I would like it to prompt in the info line, 
something like 'no new items in newsgroup; move to next (a.b.c)? (n/y) [y]'

My other problem is just like the multiple aaddress books problem - I 
wind up with .newsrc on unix and NEWSRC on the PC out of step, and have 
to remember to ftp the across - can we have remote access to the unix 
.newsrc from the PC, please (sometime)

I assume this is a wishlist item, but if not, please let me know!

I would like to run PINE under OS/2; plainly an OS/2 workplace shell PINE 
requires work, so I would expect to run it in a DOS box. However, so far 
as I can find out, PINE does not work with the available TCPIP 
implementations.  (we have tried IBM's TCPIP for OS/2, and LWP)

Hi folks.
Beeing a newbie, I have 2 questions. They may FAQs, if so flame me (we
need some warmening up here in Sweden :-).

1) In out native language, we use some 8bit characters (=E5=E4=F6).
   Entering them in a mail is no problem, but after I have sent the mail
   the characters are translated. How do I get rid of this translation ?
   My mailers at the other end can handle 8bit characters, but not the
   encoded characters.

2) How do I add a post-processing filter, which takes to *BODY* of the
   mail after I have sent it and process it. (i.e. How do I add
   automatic pgp signing of my messages ?)

BTW, Pine is a great product (If I flatter you, I might get more and=20
friendlier responses)

   I've got SLIP and LINUX running on my PC at home and I'd like to use Pine
for sending email from there, but really need the Reply-To header since my PC
is only on the net a few hours a night and my main mailbox is at work
anyway.

   Anyways, before I invest some time making source mods, does anyone have
patches that implement the Reply-To?

   Also, I found in the c-client where the remote IMAPd link (rimapd) is
specified as /etc/rimapd.  I might suggest that the path to rimapd be a
variable in the system .pinerc file in the next release.  My central mail
server sysop will not support IMAP (yet), so I had to make a source code mod
to run my own private copy of imapd.  I just changed the path to rimapd in
the source for my pc-linux version of pine (to bin/rimapd), and copied imapd
to to bin/rimpad on my private account at work.  It's working just fine so
far.

   Keep up the good work on Pine, I'm starting to prefer it over ELM.  As
soon as you put in user-defined headers and message tagging, it'll be no
contest between the two.  (Ok, one minor beef remains, I don't like that the
addressbook doesn't support comments.  But I've now a central ELM format
addressbook and a shell script I use to produce a Pine .addressbook).

Greg,

The next version of Pine will include support for the Reply-To header.  
In the mean time, if your username is the same on your local and remote 
systems, you might be able to get the effect you want by setting the 
user-domain variable in your .pinerc.  The problem with making the path 
to rimapd configurable is that if you move it then only clients with the 
same configuration will be able to use it.  This would lead to no end of 
confusion if you get users trying to use other (c-client based) clients, 
or even the same client program with a different path.  

We are still mulling over how to implement user-defined headers.  Message
annotation and flagging are proposed or in the works.  Addressbook comments
may well come as a side-effect of IMSP support.  Anything else you need? 

Thanks for the request!

   David, I really appreciate your incredibly prompt and curteous reply!
I imagine it is a bit disheartening to software developers when their
users always write in and say "I don't like this!" and "Why didn't you do
that?", as I myself have been known to do from time to time.  Your
enthusiasm is great.

   Thanks for the hint on the user-domain, that solves my problem nicely.

   And as for the addressbook, well, I have always kept and will continue
to keep one file with email, postal, and telephone information.  However,
I have no problem with keeping a separate addressbook and then converting
to what the mail program can use, that's what I've been doing.  That means
I cannot use the 'take address' feature of Pine, of course.

   My current vision of a 'perfect' addressbook is be one that:
- is a text file (Pine's is)
- is never sorted.  Mailer only modifies it by adding at the end.
    (ELM's is not sorted)
- has comments begin with '#' character. (ELM uses #)
- does NOT use a single tab or space as a separator.  Pine's single
    tabs make the addressbook ugly and hard to read.  (ELM's '=' is fine).

   I've recently rewritten the shell script I use to convert from ELM
addressbook format to .mailrc, and now to Pine's .addressbook.  I've
attached it in case anyone else would care to use it.  I won't guarantee
it'll work for everyone else, but it works great for me.  It requires an
'awk' program and 'sed'.

Greg,

The current proposed c-client API for IMSP (aren't acronyms wonderful ;)
includes driver-based addressbook support, much like the current mailbox
drivers.  This means that it will be quite easy for someone to write
additional drivers for other addressbook formats, like .mailrc, ELM, etc. 

Thanks for the scripts!

I have switched my users here over to pine 3.89, using the precompiled
version from ftp.cac.washington.edu. ( I'm running Pico 2.3 - also 
precompiled. I don't remember if that is still the old version, or if
that is the latest. ) 

Some people have been reporting that Pine locks up on them when they 
have entered Compose Mode. They are unable to enter any text or cancel
with Control-C. 

I was able to reproduce ONE problem: 
  *IF* there was an improper exit from Pine while composing a message,
  it appears to want to INSIST that you continue a postponed message. 
  If I said "YES" , I was able to again postpone the message, and 
  continue. If I said "No", It entered compose mode and froze. 

After I had instructed one person on the way around this, I was called
in on another case of freezing in compose mode, where it had nothing
to do with a deferred or interrupted message. 

( I tried starting with "pine -z" , and was also unable to suspend the
  program with Control-Z. )

The first case, I can reproduce from xterm session or nsca telnet session
( and probably any other connection. ) The second case I have only seen
once (i.e. one REPORT, I was able to induce the problem repeatedly, 
and finally told them to use pine.old ) from a Macintosh NCSA Telnet 
emulating vt100. 

Has anyone else seen this problem? 

( I've been searching back thru the archive, as I remembered quite a 
  number of RS6000/AIX problems, but I haven't yet found this one. )

Does anyone use ispell in pine ? If so how does one get an interactive 
usage like typing ispell <filename> ? I am using ispell 4.0.

Thanks,

Keith,

If you set the "editor" variable in your .pinerc file to "ispell" you can 
use the '^_' key in the composer to call ispell interactively.

I do have the problem of locking up when I'm using PINE on the
RS/6000 AIX system... however, I don't even get as far as getting
into compose mode... My system (PINE) would lock up as I enter the
Menu screen. ... I would examine the debug file and it wouldn't even
complete the debug... it goes half way into the debug ... then
nothing.

I would then have to kill the process from another shell.

Hello.

The rimapd functionality is not for ``remote imapd'' (although you seem 
to be using it successfully for that), but rather for pre-authenticated 
IMAP connections using the BSD r protocols.  The normal means of 
accessing IMAP servers is via a TCP/IP connection to port 143.

The reason why the /etc/rimapd name is wired in to the code is that for
the pre-authentication service to be meaningful, it has to use a single,
globally-valid means of access.  If the attractive nuisance of having it 
as a parameter were available, then people would be misled into changing 
it, and then discover that the service broke when trying to access other 
systems.

We are aware that there are legitimate reasons such as yours why you 
would want to change it.  It is for this reason (among others) that we 
provide sources; we feel that someone who understands the issues will 
also understand how to modify the source code AND will understand that he 
is making a non-standard change.

For your particular application -- access to a private imapd -- it is 
intended that there will be an alternative mechanism.  This is part of 
the general idea to have ``dialup IMAP'' without requiring SLIP or PPP.
There isn't any time estimate yet on when this will happen; but it will 
probably be some time this year after IMAP4 support is finished.  So, 
help is one the way!

Thank you for your suggestions, and for reminding us that your type of 
application is still not adequately addressed.

Regards,

-- Mark --

More info:
I have NOW reproduced the problem to the extent that I can't
successfully get into pine again. ( continuing the interrupted
composition, as suggested, also freezes. ) 

I have exited with a "kill -HUP" from another window.
When I tried a "kill -QUIT" instead, I get a message 
from Pine "Emergency Exit ... :" , the cursor has moved
to the correct position to answer the question, but I can't
type anything. ( i.e. no echo and no response ) 

[ I have also retrieved the latest aix32  pico binary , and it is 
  identical to the one I have installed. ] 

The tail end of ~/.pine-debug1 ( from the HUP exit ) contains:

Steve,

Can you repeat this test with the "-d9" option set and send the whole 
thing to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu?  (no need to bother pine-info with 
the gorey details)

Thanks for the report!

I was wondering if anyone in the world of PINE is using it with the
sticky bit set.  I seem to have a huge number of users using PINE at
trhe same time, and unless PINE is build with demand paging and/or
shared text, setting the sticky bit should help me.

Any comments on the sticky bit and/or the way PINE is made and if they
use demand paging and shared text would be appreciated.

Thanks

Barry,
Mark reminded me that if your news database is on a machine where you 
have a home directory, you can keep your .newsrc on that machine, and use 
IMAP to access news from anywhere, without having to worry about multiple 
copies of .newsrc being out of sync.

To access news via IMAP, just take the "/nntp" out of the news collection
specification. 

Later on we will have true location independence for all the Pine 
auxiliary files, including address books and .newsrc files.

Ippokratis,

Multiple postponed messages may not make the next release, but it is 
definitely on the "short" list of enhancements. 

Reply-to support will be in the next release.

We'll add changing list order to the requested enhancement list.

I had this problem for a while with version 3.87 on our RS/6k AIX 3.2, 
and i solved it by using termcaps instead of curses.  For some unknown 
reason, both the curses and extended curses libraries would lock up the 
computer if the user would go directly into compose.  If the user would 
first go into the mail index and then compose it would work for that one 
time, but the very next compose would lock up.
On some terminals the pine would just lock up.  On others it would just 
send lots of garbage.  A check of stty showed that pine was changing the 
baud rate down to 50 or 110 bps!
BTW, Aix 3.2 has a woefully inadequate termcaps file, so I searched 
Archie for the file termcap.src and got a much more complete one from 
somewhere else.

How does pine determine the order to list the files in the 'L'ist Folders 
screen?  I'd like to order my folders with some of the more important 
ones at the top, but I cant figure out how it determines the order to 
list them in.

It used to sort them alphabetically but as of some fairly recent version 
(can't remember which one offhand, maybe not until 3.89) it lists them in 
the same order you have them listed in your folder-collections variable.

Thank you for creating Pine.

Off-the-wall requests for split personalities:

The ability to change return address to an alias, because I wear more 
then one hat.  System Admin, Helpline, Info-request, etc.  It would be 
nice to maintain the illusion.

And on the same line, a signature file toggle key-stroke, for an alternate 
signature (or two).

I accept little, and appreciate all you have done already.

Michael,

The next version of pine will support the Reply-To: header.  We have 
discussed the possibility of making From: configurable, but we still have 
some reservations...

One possibility that has been proposed for multiple signatures is to not 
have a .signature, but to have several files with short names (e.g. .s1, 
.s2, ...) and just use ^R to read in the appropriate one.  We do have 
items on our requested-enhancement list to have switchable signatures, 
but I don't know when/if we will get to them.

Thanks for the suggestions!

Pico seems to have some arbitrary line-length limitation.  I don't see
an option to change it.

While we have Pine 3.89, I'm about to suggest people edit their .newsrc
to subscribe and unsubscribe, but I see they can get into big trouble
if the .newsrc was created by rn or trn and has a line like this:

news.answers! 1-17801,17805,17860-17862,17880-17881,17892,17901-17905,17920-17921,17926,17933-17935,17945,17948-17956,17958-17959,17961-17963,17983,17990-17993,18013-18017,18058-18059,18062,18073-18075,18095-18106,18117,18122-18123,18148-18155,18278,18858

since Pico rewrites it to several 80-column lines like this:

news.answers! 1-17801,17805,17860-17862,17880-17881,17892,17901-17905,17920-1792
1,17926,17933-17935,17945,17948-17956,17958-17959,17961-17963,17983,17990-17993,
18013-18017,18058-18059,18062,18073-18075,18095-18106,18117,18122-18123,18148-18
155,18278,18858

and now rn can't read it.  Woof.

Oops, I have mis-reported the problem with Pico's line length.  The
example quoted is wrong.  It does not cut at 80 columns.  

It did cut this very long line in two, with 3 blank spaces between the
two parts:

Sigh...  We changed from libtermcap to libcurses due to complaints about the
inadequate termcap file.  Now it looks like libcurses is causing problems at
some sites :(  Unfortunately, alot of the problems that are reported on 
AIX 3.2 do not show up on our AIX 3.2 machines...  Any suggestions or 
insights from the AIX gurus out there would be appreciated!

Along different lines it would be nice to be able to redirect a message 
to another recipient and have it retain the original reply address.  For 
example, someone sends me a request to do something I no longer do, I 
currently have to forward that request to the correct person who does the 
task, and replies saying it is done.  Of course, the reply comes to me 
instead of the original requestor.  Does this make sense?  Is this 
functionality planned?  I think pine would have to use the resent header 
lines?

Joe,

Pico appears to have a 255 character line length limit when reading a file. 
It can however compose and write longer lines.  I will make sure this gets on
the bug/limitation list.  The next version of Pine will have
subscribe/unsubscribe commands, so you should not have to put up with the
pain of editing .newsrc by hand for too long ;)

The "bounce" command will also be available in the next release.  It adds 
the Resent-* lines, but otherwise leaves the message and headers intact.

Given the choice, I'd rather use pico than vi to compose my news messages :-)

Actually, given the choice I'd rather use Pico than just about any 
standard or semi-standard Unix editor for anything that doesn't involve 
regular-expression matching (emacs/vi/etc fans please Reply-to: /dev/nul ;-))

Question is - can I use pico separately from pine on a Unix system, as I 
can (and do!) on a PC? I can't find an executable for pico in the same 
directory as pine (I do 'which pine' and then list the directory it's in) 
so does that mean that pico is part of the pine executable, and is only 
available separately if compiled separately?

I'm asking on the net rather than from our sysadmin because (a) its late 
and the sysadmin has gone home and (b) because others may like this info 
too. 

I've struggled with vi and micro-emacs and I know I'm not the only person
crying out for a halfway decent editor for wordsmithing (and even for
non-document use: actually I was prompted to write this by Joe Brennan's
query about using pico for editing .newsrc) - and a halfway decent editor
I'm already familiar with (from pine) seems too good to be true!  I think
pico could be for general unix file-bashing what pine is for mail - a
powerful easy-to-use tool for the non-techies.

John,

Yes, there is a standalone Pico for Unix.  It is usually installed in the
same directory as Pine, but not necessarily.  Apparently your sysadmin
neglected or declined to install it... 

Thanks for the request!

Dumb question corner... I know this one's been through before, but I 
didn't save it.

How does one use PGP with pine so that a detached signature certificate is
created (or any other option). I suspect the alternate editor feature is
involved. I tried it with pgp -fsb, but only got silliness. Thanks for
your thoughts.

Subject:      calendar function to supplement Pine
To: Pine Info List <pine-info@cac.washington.edu>

I hope that this is not too far off of the intent of the list.

My campus is using Pine as the email agent for a campus wide email
system.  We currently still have several hundred PROFS users who have
not migrated to Pine.  Part of the reason for this is that there is
no calendar function built into Pine.  Does anyone know of a package
either public or commercial which allows vt100 users to maninpulate
their own calendars?  Using cm is not an option since 98% of the users
do not have X-Window access.

Thks.

Jim,

I don't have any recommendations for packages, but there is an item on 
our requested-enhancements list to add a calendar function to Pine.  It 
has not made the "short" list yet, but we will keep it in mind.  Let us 
know what (if anything) you come up with!

Don't forward but reply to all recipients when delegating the request.
Then the Reply-To: will stay as To: in the header, you'll just have to
insert the address of your co-worker.  It's definitely nice for your
customer to know who's responsible for his request now.  If your
co-worker replies to the complete group too, you will be informed the
message's been handled but you won't have to forward it any more.

We have several pop3 severs -- can pine access them as well as remote
imap servers and how?

Thank you in advance.

Yaakob,

No, Pine does not support POP.  The same machine can serve as both a pop3 
and imap server though.  The UW IMAP distribution even includes a pop3 
server that coexists quite well with imapd.

Thanks for the request!

Hello.

At the present time, Pine can not access POP servers.  It could be made to
without too much difficulty, by writing a POP driver in the c-client engine
used by Pine for mailbox access.

However, there are serious questions as to how useful this would be.  POP
protocol is not very powerful, and a number of the operations that Pine does
are unimplementable in POP.  The most useful thing that POP could be used for
is to download messages to a local file in PC-Pine.  For daily server-based
mailbox usage, however, POP would probably be intolerable.

 Hi Mark,
	I am working with sticky bit on PINE, it is functional... perhaps 
it is not the solution your problem of speed, but help...

		chmod 1755 /usr/bin/pine

	One comment, if you want to diminish the work of you system, I 
suggest you increase the seconds that PINE wait for read the 

                /usr/spool/mail/$USER

 on ~/pine3.xx/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h :

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Timeouts (seconds)

#define NEW_MAIL_TIME      (60) /* How often to check for new mail.

                                   some expense in doing this so it shouldn't
                                   be done too frequently.  */

One thing I've noticed that annoys me...
the behavior of TAB and moving through folders.  The behavior of it now is that
it stops at the last folder in the list.  To go back, one must L to list
folders and select a folder that way.  Why not make it so that either
you can SHIFT+TAB to move back through the folder list or so that TAB will
wrap back to the first folder in the list?

Some of our users are gravitating to using pico on AIX system with 
'another' mailer elm but I also notice this happens when selecting compose 
in pine.  The last line of an imported file from in my example 
WordPerfect generated text file does not end in newline but a Ctrl-Z.  
Pico complains about a funny line at EOF but drops the last line.  Using 
PINE3.87.  Is this changed in later versions or are there plans to change 
pico's action?

Deborah,

Ctrl-Z is the end-of-file character for DOS.  This should get filtered out if
you use a text-mode transfer rather than a binary transfer between DOS and
Unix.  Pine 3.89 also handles binary DOS files much better than Pine 3.87
did.  Thanks for the report!

Ippokraths,

Don't you want ISO-8859-7?  You also need a terminal that supports the
ISO-8859-7 character set.  Pine does not do any translations on either 
composed or recieved messages.  It assumes that you have set your 
terminal to match what is specified in the character-set variable.

Thanks for the report!

ISBN is the International Standard Book Number, you'll hardly want
that.  The name of your charset is ISO-8859-1, I guess it stands for
International Standardization Organization.  You should only select
the Greek charset if you already have that alphabet on your keyboard
and screen.  Now if you send texts that contain non-ASCII letters they
will be labeled ISO-8859-7 and encoded quoted-printable so they can be
transmitted over ASCII wires and the right characters will be
displayed on the receiving side.

Pine is an interactive program. Why would you want to run it in the
background?  You can suspend it with ^Z and fg, but...

Oh, I see.  You get the fastest and least expensive notification with
biff y.  If biff is not an option, you can have your shell check for
new mail every 60 seconds or so:

	csh:	set mail = ( 60 /usr/spool/mail/jp17 )
	sh:	MAIL=/usr/spool/mail/jp17 MAILCHECK=60

You're supposed to be happy about it.

The mailer at the other end may well be 8bit-clean, but how about the
servers that transport the message?  Many of them tend to cripple
your accents into something unrecognizable.

The MIME specification allows for the translation between different
encodings so ideally it's up to your transport software to recode to
8bit if it's confident.

You and your correspondents should use procmail to decode your letters:

	: fbw
	^Content-Transfer-Encoding:.*quoted-printable
	| mmencode -u -q
	: afhw
	| formail -I 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit'

I don't know if the newest Pine has an option for specifying your own
sendmail-program.  The old version I still have here does not.

This will of course only works if he's logged into the mail server or if 
his mail spool directory is NFS mounted. Any methods currently available 
for clients? I've had a user ask about this too. I personally just leave 
pine running at all times, but different strokes for different folks.

Hi, Pine Expert:

How do I save message to a folder which is not in my home directory?  

Here is what I need to do :
When I receive a message, I need to save it to a directory called
	/local/gopher-data/bbs   <== a data used by gopher server and I have
				     all the access to it.
My mail directory is /users/deng/mail. 

Of course the simple way I am doing now is to copy the file to the bbs
directory.  But I want to set it up for somebody who doesn't have any 
system knowledge to do the job by simply saving the message to the 
right place and delete the old message in the folder.  Thank you very 
much in advance.

Use a program called screen, available from the GNU archives. You will
be able to have multiple "windows" or screens from your tty when you're
at home. I don't know if I can ever survive without it.

I do a slightly tricky thing myself. I run screen within screen. This means
that when I'm at work or anywhere using an xterm or whatever, I use
my special email screen which has pine running in it. Then when I'm at
home or anywhere else, I run screen (naturally), and in one of those screens
I grab my mail session... 

Then when pine beeps at you from another window, screen will tell you that
there is a beep in another window (which you would probably recognise as your
email/pine window)



NAME
     screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation

SYNOPSIS
     screen [ -options ] [ cmd [ args ] ]
     screen -r [ [pid.]tty[.host] ]

DESCRIPTION
     Screen is a full-screen window manager  that  multiplexes  a
     physical   terminal  between  several  processes  (typically
     interactive shells).  Each  virtual  terminal  provides  the
     functions  of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several
     control functions from the ANSI X3.64  (ISO  6429)  and  ISO
     2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for mul-
     tiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer
     for  each  virtual  terminal  and a copy-and-paste mechanism
     that allows moving text regions between windows.


The simple answer is, get screen (or iscreen I think it is sometimes called)
from your favourite GNU software archive. It really is the best thing since
sliced bread.

Sharon,

Just give the full pathname when the save command asks for the folder name. 
Alternatively, you can put a symbolic link in your mail directory. 

Thanks for the request!

Just a trivial one:  The Save message command, prompting you for the
folder name, allows TAB as an option to `complete' the name of an
incompletely typed but unique folder.  Wouldn't it be nice if the Fcc:
prompt in Rich Header mode could (use the same code and) work the same
way?  Just an idle thought..

Is there any way to tell pine to save messages that I send by the 
addressee?  As in, I want all mail going to foobar1 to be saved in fb1, 
all mail I send to root and bugs to be saved in admin, etc..?

Is this on the wish-list?

Hi!

When pine is using rimap it simply does rsh hostname /etc/rimapd, right?
Is it somehow possible to use different username? I mean something like this:
	rsh -l diffuname hostname /etc/rimapd
If not, please add this feature...

incoming-folders=Other_INBOX {diffuname@foo.fo.f}INBOX

Corey,

This problem is on the list for consideration.  SHIFT+TAB won't work 
because there is no consistent definition for it across different 
keyboards.  

Thanks for the request!

Jost,

Sorry about the very late reply!  PC-Pine works with some SLIP packet 
drivers and not others.  Which packet driver(s) have you tried and what 
were the symptoms?

Thanks for the report!

Chris,

Sorry about the delayed response, we have been swamped.  The next version 
of Pine will support text/enriched via "mailcap" support, and hopefully 
we will get built-in support done as well.

Thanks for the request!

I've been innocently storing my read messages in 
"c:\pinemail\holding.mtx" since I started using PINE.  Although I knew 
the file was getting large, there were no signs of trouble until recently 
when PINE started telling me it couldn't parse the headers.

I split the file into two separate files (keeping them ASCII, of course), 
and still got the same messages.  When I began to search the files using 
WordPerfect, I found that apparently there were no messages added to the 
file after January 19, when a big batch of them went in.  

My memory is vague, but I believe I did go into this file using PINE and 
read some stuff that came in during February.  But I'm not sure.

Is there a known limit to the size of an .mtx file that pine can read?  I 
thought pine trees didn't shed their leaves...

In PC Pine, I get the above error message when attempting to open certain
folders.  Some folders are ok and others not (all are local--on my pc hard
drive).  I don't see anything "funny" in the mail headers when viewing the
file from a text editor.  What might be the cause?  Thanks.

Al,

There is no explicit limit on the size of a folder, but it is always possible
that you could run out of memory in PC-Pine.  How did you split the folder? 
You have to be *extremely* careful when editing an MTX format folder!  Pine
depends very much on the length of each message staying the same.  Some
editors will silently remove trailing whitespace from lines, convert tabs to
spaces, etc, which will break an MTX folder every time :(

Thanks for the report!

Vern,

This error is caused by a problem with the MTX internal header for a 
message which looks something like:

	22-Feb-1994 08:42:51 -0800,755;000000000031

Specifically, Pine could was looking for the ',' and ';'.  Note that the 
MTX format is very sensitive to the length of each message (in bytes) 
remaining unchanged once it has been written.  This length is the number 
between the ',' and ';'.

Thanks for the report!

Barry,

I don't think we have any short term plans for OS/2 support......

This sounds sensible - but I have an alternative.
Though I like the multi item per line display of folder names (since
I have loads of folders) I think it confuses the interface (and
anyway I should be using hierarchical folders to impose order on my
mailboxes).

Where there is a list of items to choose from, would it not be more 
consistent to have a vertical list, with the DOWN_ARROW and UP_ARROW keys
to  move down and up the list (with wrap around at top and bottom).

One could then add RIGHT and LEFT arrow
(as in the unix character WWW lynx command, and in usenet news TIN), i.e.

	RIGHT_ARROW	- activate current select on a list
	LEFT_ARROW	- back to previous menu

I have several filters setup to go to other folders (this being one of 
them) and I was thinking that if a TAB will take me to the next folder, 
why not have backTAB take me to the previous one ?

When I reply to the following message with Pine, It inserts "> " before
the "In artictle" line, but not before the rest of his message.  Is it the
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary" that causes this?  If it's going to 
change any lines, I'd expect it to change all lines.  I'm confused.

A good example is Macintosh Common Lisp which was born at a time where a
MacPlus was the hottest machine you could get.  The current version still
doesn't need more than 2.5MB RAM to run (on the previous (1991) version you
could even still do development with 2.5MB RAM -- I developed a couple of
small (but power-consuming) programs on a 2.5/20 Mac SE), whereas a typical
unix lisp implementation needs at least 10MB.  MCL is just as fast as the
unix lisps and has a better development environment.  Unfortunately, Apple
doesn't quite seem to know this themselves, and have recently come with
non-assuring statements about a PowerPC version of MCL.

Funny, the arrow keys do this for me already.

But, on the TAB front, when I'm reading mail, I have my messages sorted 
by the Date header rather than by the time received.  This means that 
often new messages come in which are above my current position, so 
TABbing doesn't bring me to the new message.  It would be nice if TAB 
were to wrap.  I'd also like a keystroke which would "delete and skip to 
next unread message".

Keith,

Not all keyboards (e.g. my X-term) have a backTAB key!  It would be nice 
to use, but unless pretty much everyone has the key, we can't use it :(

Thanks for the suggestion!

it have something to do with the ip address?  Pine hangs when I used the
BOOTP thing, and can't find an inbox when I comment that line out.

At our campus, we are planning on using Pine's native address book format 
and simply exporting CSO data to it.

However,

I WOULD LOVE CSO SUPPORT IN PINE!!!  That would make my life so much 
easier.  I realize that CSO isn't cut out to be a 'browse' like utility 
such as address books (i.e., you have to actually search for something to 
use CSO), but it would be great if Pine (PC-Pine included, hint, hint) 
had the ability to either call an external CSO program, or do a simply 
CSO formatted query itself.

For a good implementation of this, see the UNIX Gopher client from UMN.

I have aliased l to be ls -CF. Sometimes when I exit pine I get a directory
listing in the format of ls -CF. The history command does not show a ls.
Any ideas?

I have been using for a long time Pine on my DECstation.
We are now starting to use Pine (3.89) as mail agent in our institute,
both on DECs and on Suns (we are running OpenWindows 3 under SunOS 4.1.3).

We have an arrangement by which workstation users (as opposed to terminal
users) invoke a command which opens an additional window in which pine
runs. When the user exits pine, the window disappears.

This is essentially an  xterm -e pine (or dxterm -e pine).

Now, what is happening on our Suns using the /usr/openwin/bin/xterm
bundled with OpenWindows, is that a "core" file is left around after
pine exits.
This does not occur with DEC's xterm nor with dxterm.

Apparently, if we insert a "sleep" command,  creating a script like

    pine
    sleep 1

and invoke such script as xterm -e script

there is no core dump. 
However this is not a very elegant solution. 

What is the reason of the core dump (who is dumping core ? pine or
Sun's xterm ?) ? 
Are there any more elegant solution that a sleepy wrapper script ?

Jack,

Gee, you started a bit of a groundswell ;)

One of the big items on our agenda is adding support for the IMSP protocol
and big part of it is support for server-based addressbooks.  The current
proposed API definitions call for a driver-based implementation, much like
the current support for multiple folder formats.  When we get the core of
that code written, it should be a pretty simple matter to write a CSO driver. 
I don't know if we will write one, but I expect someone will contribute a CSO
driver in short order if we don't... 

Thanks for the request (all of you)!

To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <CMM.0.90.4.763837460.brennan@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>

In init.c, I see the following comment, regarding the domain variables:

  3. When expanding/fully-qualifying unqualified addresses during
     composition when a local entry in the password file exists for
     name.
         If no userdomain is given, then this lookup is always done.
         Localdomain or hostname is used to qualify this address.
         If userdomain matches localdomain then the local lookup is
         done and localdomain is used on these addresses.  Pine may
         also be configured to do local lookup even if the user
         has placed himself in another domain.  In that case the lookup
         is kind of a strange thing to do, but if so desirest...

We seem to have that strange case here.  The sending hosts have names
like bonjour.cc.columbia.edu, but we want the From line of outgoing
mail (and replies) to use just columbia.edu, our central mail hub.  We
have the user-domain set to columbia.edu in the pine.conf.  We can't
use use-only-domain-name because we are removing the first *two* parts
of the real hostname.

So what's the way to configure pine do local lookup in /etc/passwd?
I can't identify a way short of hacking the code a little.  Maybe that
isn't what the quoted text refers to?

Subject: pine not quitting on HUP
Message-Id: <CMM.0.90.4.763838445.brennan@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>


We are investigating a problem of Pine 3.89 processes continuing with
no tty after users are disconnected from our SunOS hosts.  Using the
.pine-debug* files we have narrowed it down to cases where people are
composing outgoing mail and then get disconnected suddenly, e.g.
telephone line noise, telnet connection dropped, turn off modem.  So
far we cannot reproduce it, so we are not certain precisely what
causes it.  Killing the pine process with a TERM signal results in a
.pine-debug file reporting that it got a HUP signal.  We think it may
have to do with signal handling in the pico code, but since we have
not found the answer yet we cannot say for sure.  The debug file of a
killed process nearly always ends the same way:


 === send called === 
IMAP 2:23 3/11 mm_log babble: Check completed
ioctl(TIOCWINSZ) failed :Bad file number
Save composition on HUP succeeded


** Received SIGHUP **



IMAP 9:23 3/11 mm_log babble: mailhub.cc.columbia.edu IMAP2bis server terminating connection
about to end_tty_driver


(9:23 is when root sent a TERM to kill this; mailhub.cc.columbia.edu
is where mail spool is, accessed using IMAP.)

I am writing to ask whether this sounds familiar to anyone.  We take
it the problem does not manifest itself at Washington.  Has anyone
else faced this?

Much more detail is available, but this may be something local to our
own system, so I'm omitting it for now, just hoping this is a known
problem to someone else or similar to one.

Lucio,

We have not yet completely isolated the cause of the core files.  Until we
get a fix in place, the sleepy wrapper is the recommended work-around. 

Thanks for the report!

Joe,

This was definitely a problem in earlier versions of Pine 3.8x, but the major
cause is fixed in Pine 3.89.  This is the second report of the hangs still
occurring in Pine 3.89.  In the other one there was some indication that the
session might have been suspended when (or shortly before) the connection was
dropped.  If you can figure out how to reproduce it, or get a stack trace
from a core file, please let us know! 

Thanks for the report!

Subject: Problems running PC-PINE 3.89 on AST Premium 386/25 with 3C509

We are having problems installing PINE 3.89 on an AST Premium 386/25 with
a 3COM 3C509TP network interface and DOS 6.2. We have successfully run
the same version of PINE on other PCs e.g. Compaq Deskpro 486/33i with 
3C509TP and generic 386/33 with 3C507TP, etc. 

On the AST we have tried both packet drivers (Crynwr 3C509.COM ver. 10.1)
and NDIS driver (ELNK3.DOS ver. 2.0 dated 11/25/92 from LAN Manager 2.2)
with an NDIS to packet interface (DIS_PKT.GUP ver. 1.31 dated 1/25/93). In
both of these scenarios the packet driver or the NDIS/packet combination
seem to load OK but PINE hangs displaying the [Opening "INBOX" ...]
message. We are using the same configuration files that work on the Compaq
and trying them on the AST without success. During testing we monitored
the network traffic using LAN Watch and didn't see any packets transmitted
by the PC. Using a small TSR to monitor the PCs activity it seemed to hang
in a tight loop while executing code in low memory in the DOS code or in
the SYSTEM BIOS area. 

Have you run across this problem before on this type of PC and do you 
know of a solution? We would like to continue using public domain 
software if possible.

Thank you for any suggestions you might have to solve this problem.

Don,

Does telnet work OK on the same machine?  Can you telnet to port 143 on 
the IMAP server?  

Thanks for the report!

I am subscribed to several mailing lists (including this one!).  Rather 
than have them clutter up my incoming mailbox, is it possible to redirect 
messages to other folders using the 'incoming folders=' option in the 
.pinerc file?  I realize it is possible to save messages to folders, but 
I was looking for an automatic filter.

Or does 'incoming folders=' only work if there are several /usr/spool/mail
files that one has permission to read from?

Look at the elm 'filter' program.

	Well, pine is "only" a mail UA.  It does not have any involvement
with the delivery of mail to your mailbox.

	To do what you want you will need to get either "procmail" or
the "filter" routines from the elm distribution.  Both work in similar
fashion in that they make use of the .forward file to forward incoming
mail to a process that distributes the mail according to a set of
rules.

Invoke as "pico -z" and you can *suspend* to the shell via Ctl-Z, but 
that's as close as you're going to get...

Sometimes I've noticed that a pine session will get niced to -25 and eat 
up all the CPU on my machine, is anyone else experiencing this problem ?

Or, what about something along the lines of UWIN?
L gets you into a display sort of like this:

Local folders   ----->  Work
IMAP1			Access-l----->	Johnvon
IMAP2					BCNN
...

where using the right-arrow command (either key or emacs-ish) moves you
to the right into heirarchical local folders... and left-arrow command
moves you back one level, and up- and down-arrow work intuitively.

Could you let me know what it takes to run Pc-Pine over slip?

So far, the UMSLIP.COM driver doesn't seem to work.  It doesn't interface
with BOOTP, I think.

SLIPPER13 *does* work when I use the "ether" emulation, but won't find my
host machine, which is using imap2bis, or something like that.  I get a
message, like, "128.193.4.5,143" not found.  I've tried telnetting to 143,
and sure enough I get something, but I don't know the commands to type in
to test it, and I suspect that PC-PINE doesn't either, or does it?

Subject: pine not quitting on HUP
Cc: unix@columbia.edu, brennan@columbia.edu
Message-Id: <CMM.0.90.4.764227464.marg@manila.cc.columbia.edu>

joe brennan (brennan@columbia.edu) recently reported to you that we were
seeing pine processes that hadn't heared HUP signals.

we were able to fix most instances of this hanging by not setting signal
handlers to SIG_IGN but instead calling sigblock().  then instead of
setting the signal handler back, you just call sigsetmask().  i'm not
sure how portable the sigblock system call is but our situation improved
90% with this fix installed.  it couldn't hurt to patch pine to use
sigblock/sigsetmask on systems that have it.

the fix was pretty straightforward, but let me know if you need diffs.

the only place i wasn't able to easily fix was in pico's SIGHUP handler,
do_hup_signal() in os_unix.c.  it looks like a user is composing a
message and sitting in pico when the HUP is delivered.  it's a little
confusing because of the longjmp.  attached is the stack from a process
that didn't hear a HUP, and started looping.  i think gdb got a little
confused when we longjmp'ed out of do_hup_signal.  not sure where the
QUIT is coming from...

I have several Incoming Message Folders, all filled by procmail. 
Presently, I have a small script I wrote that will tell me how many new
messages there are in each folder. I also have a small script that informs
me which folders have new messages since the command prompt was last
displayed (by examining the procmail.log). Unfortunately, that information
is not on the screen when I go into the Folder List and I loose track of
which ones I want to visit. 

I propose that pine use the status line while in the Folder List to 
display the number of unread messages of the highlighted folder while in 
the Incoming Folders portion. This would be a very positive feature for 
an already very successful program. Thank you.

A Motif-interface version is under work. As my boss has forced me into
doing some real work for the company, it will take some time before I
can do an initial release. Several weeks maybe. Depends on how busy my
'real work' makes me (and my girlfriend :-).

Anyone who has a Hewlett-Packard HP9000/73x workstation, can have a binary
executable demo-version. It is 193737 bytes gzip'ed, and very incomplete.
But you can use it to read mail and get an idea of the look-and-feel.
What you can't do yet is to send mail or update the addressbook or
modify the folder/collection lists. You can however browse the addressbook
and the folder/collection lists. You can view/save/delete/print messages.

If I can come up with an easy & quick solution to get the interface to
work under Tcl/Tk, I will do this, as the portability problems would be
reduced significantly. You wouldn't need to have Motif-library for example.
It would be easy to modify the interface.

Hello,
       I have been PERSONALLY using Pine very happily since 3.05, and
now we are going to have Pine as DEFAULT MAILER for Unix and DOS here
at IFCTR (this is motivated by the fact we are dropping a Vax used by
a good deal of my colleagues here). We have 3.89 happily running on Unix
(Ultrix and SunOS).

In order to use PC-Pine we need to install and configure imapd, using
the distributed binaries. The documentation in Pine Technical Notes (pag. 
13) are quite terse, and in particular at pag. 14 there is a mention of 
two files (/etc/imapdrc and .imapdrc) which are NOT explained ANYWHERE.

We have also retrieved the imap-3.2.tar file and I have extracted a few
files :

  imap-3.2/ANSI/c-client/Internal.DOC
  imap-3.2/ANSI/imapd/imapd.8c
  imap-3.2/RFC1176.TXT
* imap-3.2/README
  imap-3.2/Updates.DOC

but none of them look an installation AND configuration guide.
Where should I look (in the tar file or in the cac.washington.edu
archives) ?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our arrangement will be like the following (there are strangeness
for historical reasons). Please confirm my understanding of how pine,
pc-pine and imapd interact is correct.

There are here two "privileged" machines :

   [A] is a DECstation which is domain nameserver, mail exchanger for
       the domain, and Internet-Decnet gateway

   [B] is a Sun which is NIS server and our main disk file server

Then there are a number of "personal" workstations [X] and PCs [x].  

-------------

   All workstations [X,A,B] send their internet mail directly. Decnet and
   Bitnet mail is gatewayed to machine [A]
   Mail exits as from "user@ifctr.mi.cnr.it"

   All incoming mail for the domain comes to machine [A], which knows the
   netwide aliases file (kept on [B]), and is delivered currently as :

     - to workstations [X] for their owners
     - to the Vax for most of the others (this will be dropped)
     - to workstation [B] for the "general" unix users

   machine [A] is the only one to have a "special" sendmail.cf

----------

   What we would like now is to have 4 classes of users :

   a) owners of [X], which should continue sending and receiving mail
      from their workstation
   b) generic unix users, which should continue sending and receiving
      mail on [B] 
   c) local users with a PC [x]. They should receive mail in an inbox
      on machine [B] (or [A] ?), read it via pc-pine/imapd and keep it
      on their PC via auto-save feature, and set it from [x].

      - to allow them sending mail we should designate [A] as smtp-server,
        shouldn't we ? 
      - is there any special arrangement needed in sendmail.cf on [A] ?
      - do they need to have an account on [B], or can imapd work 
        without an account ?  

   d) local users with PC [x] which however need access to their mail
      via remote login. In this case we plan to provide them an account
      on [B], and they should be able to use either pine or pc-pine via
      imapd to read all of their mail (new and old).

      - for an imapd user, can|must the inbox be the usual
        /var/spool/mail/user ?
      - can an imapd user also access a set of folders on a private
        directory (we would like to have read mail stored under the
        user login directory, and not on /var, for quota reasons.

      - is there any preference to have imapd on [A] or [B] ? 

-----------

Is all of this sensible and what are the steps to configure imapd (pointers
to documentation files to read will be appreciated) ?

Keith,

Can you tell what the Pine session is doing at the time?

I've just obtained an Intel based Unixware system.  Has anyone compiled 
pine on this platform?  If so, can you provide any insight to me as I 
plan on attempting this.

Marg,

Most of the hanging problems have been fixed in the current Pine 3.89
release.  There are still a couple unresolved reports, but the occurances
seem to be pretty uncommon.  You are correct that there are portability
problems with alot of the signal handling routines. 

Thanks for the suggestions!

Andrew,

Our current experimental code includes a command to display the counts of
messages in all of your incoming folders on the folder-list.  It also has a
flag for messages that have arrived since you viewed the index of a folder. 
Unfortunately this command is quite slow at present.  It turns out to be
almost as fast to open each folder in turn, viewing each index... 

Thanks for the suggestion!

Lucio,

It sounds like you have found most of the documentation we have.  Basically,
you copy the imapd binary to the appropriate directory and add a line to the
services and inetd.conf files.  Then send a SIGHUP to the inetd process and
you should be ready to go.  The imapdrc and .imapdrc files are only used 
in very unusual configurations that you probably will not be using.  

Your configuration looks pretty good.  One caution is that if the [X] 
workstations are NFS mounting any of their folders, you should use IMAP 
to access them directly from the system that physically stores them.  
Pine and imapd have trouble trying to lock files on an NFS mounted 
filesystem.

The IMAP only clients need accounts on the server, but they do not
necessarily need a login shell.  The INBOX is usually in the usual system
location, but can be moved with appropriate /usr/local/lib/pine.conf or
~/.pinerc entries. 

Thanks for the request!

I am running Pine on unixware.

The way i did it with the sdk is to compile with sysv type of compiler.
Everything but pine should compile ok. 
To compile Pine too, copy the 2 header files that give you an error int 
he pine directoty, erase the 2 lines that gives an error and include I. 
in the libflags or ccflags and thats it. It a funny include bug.

Alternatively you might be able to get away with just adding "-Dconst="

I haven't been successful in getting pc pine to get all the information
that is needed from our bootp server.  The critical bits are:

IP address
Subnet Mask
Default gateway

Do you have any helpful hints?

Two questions:

1) Is there any way to have Pine scan /var/spool/mail more frequently 
while Pine is open?  Displaying a new message seems to lag xbiff by a 
bit.  Is there a config option?  I couldn't find one.....

2) What is the easiest way to include a custom header (like X-Face:) on 
each mail message?

Not without changing the source.  You can force an update by pressing ^L
though.

Use Elm? ;-)

The next release of Pine will probably have a mechanism to allow custom 
headers though.

I ve been using Pine 3.88 ( I cant find 3.89 ) 2 months now. During the 
las week I ve faced many different small problems. The most serious and 
most constant of all seems to be the one I m facing now... every 10 
minutes pine tells me " Folder shrank from **** to **** bytes, aborted "
; and after that every message goes blank, so I have to leave and reenter 
pine... The folders seem unchanged after that, although i have had some 
minor problems with them a few days ago...

Thank you.

Howdy!

If my memory is working (not a likely thing), a discussion of the 
Reply-To: field went by a couple of weeks ago. Was the end result that 
Reply-To: would be in Pine 3.90?

TIA,

Dave

Pierre,

No, but the UW IMAP distribution contains ipop2d and ipop3d servers.  Get 
mail/imap.tar.Z from ftp.cac.washington.edu.

Thanks for the request!

Pierre,
Alas, no.

IMAP is a functional superset of POP, but not a syntactic superset.
In other words, the two protocols are not compatible.

I know of one POP client (POPmail from U Minnesota, I think) that can be
configured to use either POP or IMAP servers.  (But, in POP tradition, it
will delete messages from the server after retrieving them.)

-teg

p.s. IMAP's default port is 143.

Yep it does....

We have been using 3.89 on various flavours of 4.0 and 4.2 since it came 
out (we did some of the 5.4 port stuff for pine, way back in 3.0xxx.)
This works on both Intel and Sparc platforms, but we can not say for sure 
with unixware, because we run destiny code, not novell.

As long as we're talking about things for the 'next version':

Any chance the ability to automatically BCC to distributions instead of 
having to mess with the full headers and all that can be added/considered?

Ed, We've given up answering that question for Lent :)

Gosh... we didn't know that!

Email from Pine team members will typically say 3.90 in the MsgID since 
we do try to inflict new code on ourselves before others, but so far the
3.90 development code has only been used by us, and development is 
continuing.  

We were just talking about schedules this morning, and didn't reach a 
conclusion, except that it was definitely past next Tuesday :)

Since there is still have more stuff we want to get in, I'm guessing 
a Beta release in May or thereabouts.  But that's a guess, and Mike 
hasn't heard me say it before now...

Hello, all-

I followed he instructions for installing imapd (made the appropriate
entries in /etc/services and /etc/inetd); I'm assuming this only needed 
to be done on the server side...

from pine (v. 3.89) I get "connection refused" when trying to access a 
remote INBOX. Am I missing something? This is on SunOS 4.1.3 for  the server.

Any help greatly appreciated!

Hello, all-

I'm in desperate need of a Reply-To line! I'm dialing up via ppp and
accessing my remote mail over the ppp line. The problem is that my
local uid is one thing, and my remote uid another. I have no problems
getting my remote mail with this other uid but sending email is turning
out to hellish because it looks like it comes from dlc@teleport.com
(non existant)  instead of nehalem@teleport.com (hint, don't use
dlc@teleport.com if you reply to this).  Assuming the two uid's are
never in sync, what can I do? 

Once again, pointers/suggestions will receive my deep gratitude!

	Did you send a SIGHUP to your inetd process, or reboot your machine,
so that it will recognize the changes you made to the files?

There has been several bursts of discussion about creating
a pine USENET newsgroup as an alternative way to distribute
pine-info.  What became of that?  Was that a yes/no/maybe?

I've been trying to hang on to my pine subscription until such
a day, but I am able to read less and less of the traffic and
will probably drop off the list soon.  For those of us with
access to a newsfeed and threaded newsreader, a newsgroup is a
marvelous solution to the signal-to-noise ratio inherent in
matching any one subscriber's interests to a high-volume
discussion.

I originally said I would step y'all through the procedure, in case
the readers here aren't used to the rules of newsgroup creation. 

The things we need to do though, before an RFD is issued (request for
discussion) on news.announce.newsgroups is:

1) Decide if the group will be gated to the mailing list, and if so, who
will handle this. My site isn't a logical choice for this since we a leaf 
site at the end of a 56K link. 

2) Decide the name (comp.mail.pine sounds good to me)

3) Get a committment from the pine developers to participate in the 
group (not run it, just read and post) like they do here. That will add
a lot of value to it. Note that if it is gated to the mailing list, this
is a moot point.

4) Write the RFD that will be submitted to n.a.n. Decide what other groups
the RFD should be cross-posted to. (news.groups, comp.mail.misc, 
comp.mail.elm -- whoops, sorry, Pine Is Not Elm -- forgot! :-)


Below is an RFD for another group I scarfed from n.a.n.  The RFD should
somewhat match the below one, including things like moderation status 
(un-moderated), group charter, and rationale for wanting it (why is the
mailing list not a viable solution anymore for many, etc...)


Newsgroups: news.announce.newgroups,news.groups,comp.lang.misc
Subject: RFD: comp.compilers.pccts
Followup-To: news.groups
Date: 22 Mar 1994 17:14:43 -0500

	Request For Discussion (RFD):    comp.compilers.pccts

	This message seeks to initiate a discussion on the creation of a
new USENET newsgroup "comp.compilers.pccts" as described below.
Discussion should take place in news.groups. Anyone interested in the topic
is encouraged to participate.

Purpose:
--------
	This newsgroup would be for discussion of tools used in compiler
construction, specifically those which are bundled into the software package
known as PCCTS (Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set). Currently this set of
tools includes DLG for lexical analysis, ANTLR for syntax analysis and parsing,
and SORCERER for tree parsing. Possible topics include exchange of information
on getting, building, installing, and using the tools, broadcasting examples,
bug reports and patches, suggestions for enhancements, and new tools to be
added to the set. 

Rationale:
----------
	The Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set currently has over 1000
known users in over 37 countries. The tools are freely available with 
source code by anonymous ftp and are actively maintained. There is also a very 
active mailing list which is used to provide support as outlined above. With
the recent release of the SORCERER tool, traffic on the mailing list has 
increased substantially. The existing comp.compilers newsgroup provides a forum
for general compiler-related issues, but is not intended to address tools issues
or PCCTS specifically. The proposed newsgroup comp.compilers.pccts would provide
a focused forum for the users of PCCTS to exchange information as outlined in
the possible topics mentioned above. Upon creation of the newsgroup, the 
existing mailing list will be converted to a mail gateway to retain access for
users unable to receive Usenet news.

Charter:
--------
	comp.compilers.pccts is an unmoderated newsgroup which will serve as a
forum for all topics related to the installation, operation, and development
of the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set (PCCTS), including all of its
current tools, as well as any which may be added in the future. Some of the
topics to be discussed are:

- How to obtain the PCCTS package.

- Questions and answers on building and using the tools.

- How to write an ANTLR/SORCERER grammar.

- How to use Semantic/Syntactic predicates.

- Announcement of conferences and workshops.

- Ideas for Enhancements/New tools for the set.

- Posting of sample grammars and lexclasses.

Distribution:
-------------
	This RFD is being cross-posted to the following groups. Please relay
this proposal to anyone you feel may be interested.

news.announce.newgroups,news.groups,comp.compilers 

	In addition, this RFD is being posted to the existing pccts-users
mailing list.

This is a private, unofficial RFD, in the sense that I'm tired of
the "wouldn't a newsgroup be a good idea" on the pine-info mailing
list.  Here's an RFD, now D.

The group would be unmoderated, cover use and development of the
Pine mail user agent from Washington University, and take over from
pine-info@cac.washington.edu.  I don't know whether it should be
gated to that list.

If there's any agreement in news.groups that it's a good idea and a
charter is established, I'll ask Ron Dippold to run the vote.  If
nobody cares, I'll unsubscribe to the mailing list and forget it.

This RFD is sent to pine-info@cac.washington.edu in addition to the
newsgroups in the header; the CFV should, too.

(Note for pine-info:  RFD's are posted to a moderated group,
news.announce.newsgroups, so the posting won't appear until Dave
Lawrence approves it.  Discussion (the D in RFD) takes place in
news.groups, and if there's agreement on the group name and charter,
a vote takes place.  If you want a group, get on news.groups one of
the next days and say it.)

"Early Spring" (a previous estimate) is clearly late this year :-)

Yes, actually, I did both. I recently set up a http server (but that was
in standalone mode, not through inetd). Is it possible to run imapd in
a "standalone" mode? What other items  to look for?

Hi!

Hp-version of pine-3.89 sets Date:-header incorrecty.
Our TZ (finland) is now +2 (EET), but in summer it will be +3(EETDST). 
Pine seems to think we're already in summer-timezone...
Time (17:31) is correct.

 (8.6.5/8.6.5/1.12.kim) id RAA21960; Fri, 18 Mar 1994 17:13:52 +0200
Date: Fri, 18 Mar 1994 17:13:51 +0300 (EETDST)
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
				This is incorrect!
It should be +0200 (EET).

See, I *knew* I should never answer any question concerning dates! :)

Clearly, we are better at design and coding than prediction; however, let
me take this opportunity to jump further into the deep end... 

 o First, I'll observe that May is still Spring in Seattle, and indeed
   up thru May 5th or so, perhaps even *early* Spring :) 

 o Second, we are planning to use the term "Beta" for this upcoming
   release as a matter of Truth in Advertising and as an attempt to
   properly set expectations.  It doesn't necessarily mean the code
   will be any worse than usual :), but we want to be clear that it
   will have a bunch of new features, and a corresponding number of 
   new bugs to complement the bugs that are fixed in it.

 o Since Pine has now been ported to a lot more platforms than we use
   internally, we have discovered the concept of "platform-specific bugs".
   We want to be conservative in how the release is advertised, and 
   that suggests that folks with different environments should have a
   chance to find some of those platform-specific bugs before the general 
   populace assumes that a higher version number is in all respects
   superior to a lower one :)

 o Schedules are vaguely related to feature sets.  We try to avoid 
   committing to specific feature sets in releases (or schedules, for that
   matter!) so that if our internal estimates should ever prove overly
   optimistic (what??) we can "readjust" the goal without having to eat
   too much crow.  In this case, there are still a few things we know you
   are all waiting for that aren't done yet, so --alas-- it won't be
   March, especially with IETF next week.  Beyond that, we'll see.  We
   have some local requirements that will prevent us from delaying this
   blessed event *too* much longer...

So in short: "late this year" is probably when some very conservative
folks will adopt this code, or its successor, but by then we certainly
intend to have another new version with additional features to confuse the
issue.  On the other hand, *some* places will probably be running 3.90 in
production before Spring is over.  (Hey, *I'm* using it in production
already... but then it did crash once yesterday :)

Oops, I should have read the followups :)

Yes, you can run imapd standalone.  The following is a sample:

shiva1_783:pine% /usr/local/etc/imapd
* PREAUTH shiva1.cac.washington.edu IMAP2bis Service 7.6(74) at Wed, 23 Mar 1994 09:24:01 -0800 (PST)
* logout
* BYE shiva1.cac.washington.edu IMAP2bis server terminating connection
* OK LOGOUT completed

This should work either local to the server or telnetting to port 143.

Darci,

The next release of Pine will support the reply-to header.  You can 
change the domain by setting "user-domain=gasco.com" in your .pinerc 
file.  I have also heard of people editing postponed messages and using 
kludges with procmail...

Item (3) should not be a problem.  I may not get to it quite as 
diligently as the mailing list, but I will definitely participate. 

I'll add a question 1a) If there is not a bi-directional gateway, how do you
clearly distinguish between the charters of the list and newsgroup?  Some way
to minimize the cross-posting would be essential!

Hannu,

Thanks for the report!  This is a known bug that will be fixed in the 
next release of Pine.

Hello, David-


Thanks for the response, however...

The problem isn't the domain name--I want mail to go to teleport.com
--but the user id. On my local system where I run pine, I'm dlc. On
the dial up host end (where my mail really gets sent from and where I really
want replies to go), I'm nehalem. Pine is stamping my email as from:
dlc@teleport.com -- I want nehalem@teleport.com... Any other suggestions?

>>-Darci->

or helpful hints?

Yet another feature request:  Would it be possible to enable editing of

I'm afraid that is about all I have to offer.  We are hoping to get the 
next release of Pine ready for Beta release around May.....

I'm in favour of a newsgroup. Please pass this on: at the moment my news
is read-only so I can't say so myself (shouldn't be that way, but until I
find out what went wrong in my news setup my posting is to /dev/nul :-(

I would think this should be essential - at least for the first
while.  Unless this gatewaying is done you will have to follow
*two* info sources for info on pine as not all people will be able
to migrate from e-mail to USENET.   

Ken Weaverling mentioned that he might offer to act as the mail/news
gateway except that his site is at the end of a 56 kbps pipe - actually, I
don't see how this is a major problem if your site on the Internet -
message propagation times are very fast (you should be able to turn around
e-mails into postings in a few minutes and vice versa) and there isn't a
lot of volume to in this mailing list - and all you're doing to your leaf
node is increasing the link utilization that this mailing list takes up by
a factor of two - a drop in the bucket compared to a reasonable USENET
feed.  In fact *I'll* volunteer to act as as a mail/usenet gateway if no
one else is up to the task - I too have a 56 kbps Internet leaf node. 

BTW, I agree with the name comp.mail.pine - it is the only logical
choice given the current USENET mail group hierarchy.

FYI, the others are:

comp.mail.elm           Discussion and fixes for ELM mail system.
comp.mail.headers       Gatewayed from the Internet header-people list.
comp.mail.maps          Various maps, including UUCP maps. (Moderated)
comp.mail.mh            The UCI version of the Rand Message Handling system.
comp.mail.mime          Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions of RFC 1341.
comp.mail.misc          General discussions about computer mail.
comp.mail.multi-media   Multimedia Mail.
comp.mail.mush          The Mail User's Shell (MUSH).
comp.mail.sendmail      Configuring and using the BSD sendmail agent.
comp.mail.uucp          Mail in the uucp network environment.

I just wanted to clear up one minor point.  Actually, we're the 
University of Washington (in Seattle, Washington) not Washington 
University (which is in St. Louis).

	Do you really mean you edited /etc/inetd?  It should be
/etc/inetd.conf.

	If a newsgroup is established I'd hope (expect) that a di-directional
gate be set up between the newsgroup and pine-info@cac.washington.edu.
Some of us don't get news.

Hi,

while looking for a new mailreader which is able to compose and read MIME mail
I just heard about pine. Could you please give me some more information about
pine? 

Thanks in advance,

Ippokratis,

Pine 3.89 is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in 
the mail directory.

It sounds like you have some other mail application running on your system
that is modifying your INBOX without bothering to check file locks.  Do you
know if your INBOX is NFS mounted? 

Thanks for the report!

Joe Brennan reported a problem with Pine exiting properly.

Iwant to note that we've seen this problem quite freqently, on the order 
of several times per week on our system of nearly 500 accounts.  We did 
report this to the Pine folk, but since we haven't been able to replicate 
it (or even get accurate reports of when it occurs), we haven't gotten 
anywhere on getting it fixed.  All of our users are dial-up coming from 
terminal servers, so the general scenario you described of having 
connections dropped during message composition sounds quite plausible.

I encourage you to continue your investigations and report them to the 
Pine developers.  I would love to see a fix for this problem; I'm 
contemplating having a .logout file check for lingering pine processes.  
I've already got a custom script that users can run if they get a Pine 
hang.  It's a rather nasty blemish on an excellent program.

How do I configure pine so that outgoing mail will be saved in my
Mail folder in a file with the same name as the recipient, rather
than in the generic "sent-mail"?

^R for rich headers IN THE HEADER AREA, then edit the Fcc:
there is no mechanism that would automatically insert anything else than
"sent-mail" there (or default-fcc variable)
this mechanism would be difficult to implement:
- you need a rule syntax in .pinerc and code to parse it
- you need code to parse the To: header and match against rules
- you need some rules to determine where to save when there are multiple
  recipients, and all have defined save-folders, multiple fcc copies don't
  make sense

elm has this feature, enabled by setting 'savename', but it only checks
the name up to @. It is possible that different people have same login
names in different systems, so this is dumb. Also in elm the folder name
is the same as login name, you can't change this, which is dumb. Suppose
you want to save mail addressed to a certain group of people to same
folder. Of course you can link the folder to multiple names, but this
gets confusing in the long run. And your folder list will be a mess.

We have 9000 accounts on a cluster of 8 Suns (5 login timeshares, 2
file servers, 1 mailhub).  We saw 20 problems per day.  This did not
happen with pine 3.05, the previous version we used.  The fix
described to pine-bugs by Marg Suarez of our staff has dropped that to
less than 1 per day.

We could not replicate the problem either and relied on the
.pine-debug files, gdb, and asking people until we got a few who had
clear memories.  You have to get disconnected just when pine is doing
an "important" operation like a file write.  It could probably be
replicated if you have the patience to try over and over.

It wasn't clear to me what was being done with our fix.  Hey guys, do
you want the diffs Marg offered?  Will this be in the next version?

A slightly less ambitious version of this is on our list of future
enhancements.  It may or may not make it into 3.90, but it should come
soon...

Is there any way to configure Pine to automatically insert an organization

Joe,

Not currently, but we are working on that capability for Pine 3.90.

Thanks for the request!

We're seeing this same problem on a regular basis, also.  It was quite 
common in 3.07, and still seems to be happening in 3.89, although because 
of Spring Break this rev is still untested by the masses... :-)

It's most common on modem dial-ups.  The two major factors seem to be 
user error and data communication problems.

1.   Our users, when confronted with a screen of garbage or non-response from
     their session, respond with a push of the reset button or hanging up of
     connection.  I keep working on this, but have had little success.  
     Ususlly, they will try some random sequence of ctrl-c, ctrl-z, 
     ctrl-q, ctrl-d, esc, - everything they have ever used to get out of 
     a program.  They are NOT comfortable with UNIX.  They don't understand
     the concept of logging off, and that turning off their computer doesn't
     do that for them. 

2.   If there is a severe data communication disruption, such as 9600 baud
     modems attempting to renegotiate the connection because of line noise,
     pine (actually, usually pico) hangs, and the connection breaks anyway,
     leaving a hung session that can often be captured by the next 
     dial-in on that port.  And this kind of disruption happens quite 
     often, usually when someone picks up an extension on the modem line.
     My guess is that the random data spewed out during a modem
     renegotiation puts pico into just the state required to generate a
     hang.  In fairness to the Pine folks, though, it should be noted that
     much of UNIX is vulnerable to severe errors from random data entry.

     Interestingly, the lock behavior of Pine 3.89 appears to exacerbate 
the problem.  At least with the older versions users were confronted with 
a locked inbox when they logged back in, and knew they had a problem.  
Now they just go on their way, and never realize they have another 
session active.  I've considered a process check at login, but need to 
think carefully about it to avoid confusing the issue further.

     This begins to depart a bit from pine-related information, but may 
help some sites with this problem.  We have a very complicated 
data-communications path - the dial-up modems are on a Micom data PBX 
which connects users to the terminal servers.  Although the connections 
appear correct, and a static hangup works fine, as does unplugging the 
phone line, etc., during a renegotiation attempt the resulting race 
conditions appear to break the hangup sequence, and the result is that 
the connection is maintained from the modem through the PBX and the 
terminal server.  The only connection dropped is the phone line.

     We plan to eliminate the Micom this summer, and go to modems 
directly on a terminal server in the hope of eliminating this problem.
I have some doubts, however.  My users have never failed to find a way to 
generate totally-unanticipated errors.

There is a variable defulat-fcc in the .pinerc, but there doesn't to
be any counterpart to set a default BCC field in the messages one
sends.

Am I doing something wrong here, or is there a way to BCC all messages
I send to myself too? (No, I don't like using FCC if I can help it;
also pressing C-r to manually enter my address in the BCC field while
composing a new message is cumbersome and error prone).

Klaus,

We were just discussing header customization when your request arrived.  The
next release of Pine will have this capability. 

Thanks for the request!

	We're attempting to place a restricted shell on users whose accounts 
are going to be deleted, but we'd like them to still be able to use pine.
	Pine, unfortunately, won't send a letter, outputing an error:

	sh: /usr/lib/sendmail: restricted
	sh: /bin/rm: restricted

	Our restricted shell is replacing /bin/csh as a shell:
	/bin/lvl1rsh:

#!/bin/csh
clear
cat /usr/local/bin/lvl1messsage
/usr/bin/sleep 15
clear
/bin/csh
	
	I didn't think it was too complicated to just place a message 
(lvl1message) about impending account deletion and then drop users into a 
normal shell, but apparently pine does.

	Any ideas?

Daniel,

I have a similar alias but have not seen or heard of this problem before.  If
you can isolate it further or figure out how to reproduce it, please let us
know!

Joe,

I don't see a way to get what you want without some hacking either. 
Unfortunately some of the comments in the code are very ancient and have not
reflected reality for a few years... ;)

Hussain,

Pine does invoke external programs for several operations, including the
calls to sendmail and rm when sending mail.  The particular problem with
sending could be avoided by setting the smtp-server variable in a special
pine.conf file then alias pine to "pine -P restricted.pine.conf".  Printing
can also encounter a similar problem... 

I hope that helps!

Hello, all!

First, I want to publicly thank all of you who have written in response
to my queries about Reply-To: lines, impad problems, etc. You all are 
definitely a helpful bunch! 

So, I know that recently I either read somewhere in the pine documentation
or on this list that while filtering within pine is not built-in, there 
are ways to do it: procmail or ??? 

I'm a currently zmail user, subscribe to (too) many lists and run several
lists; I'm really going to need some way of filtering all my incoming
mail, even if it means downloading my entire remote inbox and then doing
it locally.

Reccommendations, anyone?

Thanks again!

In my use the elm-type fcc wouldn't work, because I usually send mail
to multiple recipients and my mail is related to projects not
recipients. Many people to whom I write are in many projects too.
Then there's personal and business related mail, which would have to
go to separate folders. See my point?

The "dumb" solution would indeed be easy to implement. The place to put
it is on line 909 in pine/send.c source file. You could parse the
login-name from first address in outgoing->to and fill pbuf.fccbuf
appropriately.
As I'm not an official pine developer, I leave this as a trivial
programming excercise for those interested in the problem.
But like David Miller already told, it's coming...

Darci,

Personally, I use "filter" from the Elm distribution.  It is pretty easy to
get working and does what I need fairly well.  Procmail is more powerful, but
it does come at a price of more cryptic syntax.  Deliver is another
possibility, but I haven't looked at it very much.  All of these programs 
divert the incoming messages before final delivery, so there should not 
be any extra downloading.

I hope that helps!

	The two methods that come to mind are "procmail" and "filter".
The "filter" program comes as part of the "elm" distribution.  Both
of them function is similar fashion.  That is, you make an entry in
your .forward like, "|/usr/lbin/filter".  Then, based on a set of
rule you've defined you mail is delivered to the appropriate folder,
or fed to another process, or deleted if that's what you want.

	The rule language of "procmail" is more flexible.  It allows
for chaining rules.  I'd started out using "filter" and still do...
mostly since I don't really need the flexibility of "procmail".
That, and I too busy (read lazy) to change.  Had I started with procmail...
I don't think I would consider changing to "filter".

We run deliver here.  I like deliver over other choices because it uses
scripts to determine where the mail goes, and not `yet another
configuration language'.  Of course, that same reason can make it
unfriendly to novice users (who wouldn't have a very hard time learning
just enough sh to get simple stuff working).

I'm wondering if it might be possible (and don't hit too hard) for future 
versions of pine to include filter with it.

Here's why.  Many sites have chosen pine over elm as their mail reader.  
So when someone says "we shoudl install this program even though it comes 
with elm", there can be a lot of administrative headaches.

If it came with pine, it would be all considered "one package" and would 
get installed without each student having to find filter (archiing for 
filter won't help) compile the whole elm set, and install the program in 
their private account.

Just a quick thought at some ingodly AM hour.

Robert,

This is certainly worth some consideration.  Here are some thoughts:

	o Filter is certainly simpler than procmail, but is it simple
	  enough for Pine's primary target audience (the very novice)?

	o How much extra customer support overhead would it generate?

	o Filter only supports the Berkeley mailbox format.  This could
	  be a severe limitation for sites and users preferring other 
	  formats.

Discussion?

I would suggest looking at Chip Salzenberg's deliver program.  This is
much simpler for the novice to use than deliver.  Each user can put a
program in $HOME/.deliver that determines the disposition of each
incoming mail message.  The program can be anything from a simple
shell script 'echo $user' to an arbitrarily complex program.

Deliver usually receives the mail through a .forward or alias of the
form: "|/usr/lib/mail/deliver usrname" (deliver gets very picky if
usrname is root and runs at sub-root priviledges).  It has separated
the message into two files, $HEADER, and $BODY, and set several
environment variables with useful things like sender and destination
addresses.  It also provides a utility function to select specified
headers from a file easily using expressions like:
    dests=`header -f to -f apparently-to -f cc $HEADER`

The user program communicates with deliver via standard output with
simple things like:
    echo $user          # deliver to the user's normal mailbox.
    echo DROP           # deep six this mail.
    echo $mailpath      # deliver to an arbitrary mail address
    echo $user:filename # store in a specific mailbox file.

The .deliver program can do anything it wants beyond this.  I use it
to filter mailing-list traffic by comparing incoming Message-Id with a
history file to eliminate duplicates, then to archive the traffic by
mailing list name.  Traffic other than mailing lists is archived by
system/user.

Probably a lot less than a program like filter since the .deliver
program is usually a shell script or perl program so the user doesn't
have to learn a new language.

Deliver understands Berkeley and mmdf.

No.  Not least because it doesn't really work.  Its man page lists
capabilities it doesn't have, and some things are buggy (at least I ran
into trouble trying to use "contains" rules and the syntax didn't seem to
be as flexible as the man page said).  I use filter, but I say "filter -r"
every single time I change my setup at all.

I think it's simple enough.  There is no need to bother with crazy outside 
scripts like with procmail or deliver (thus, no need to even know HOW to 
make a script or learn Yet Another Scripting Language).  There is also a 
fairly complete filter refereance manual that comes with elm that could 
be included (doc/filter.guide or something like that in the elm 
distribution).  By placing that alongside the tech-notes (or, I suppose, 
building it into pine like the help system), you can get fairly complete 
documentation to the users.

Filtering isn't exactly a novice activity, but it doesn't have to be the 
programmers dream/nightmare that procmail or deliver is.

> 	o How much extra customer support overhead would it generate?

Some, but the well written guide could/should be pointed to first.  And 
advanced filter questions (setting up file servers, for example) could be 
pointed towards elm forums.

This is a problem, unfortunately with no easy solution.  
	A)  We could include filter and just warn people that it will
	only work with berkeley.  Perhaps pointing other systems to 
	procmail and/or deliver.  This is nice because pine is actually 
	saying "Here's a program you might find useful.  If not, here's 
	some other outside ones that may also work."  It points it out 
	as an only mildly supported program.

	B)  We could hack filter to work with others (could be icky)

	C)  We could write up our own filter program with the simplicity 
	of filter and the ability to handle other systems.  Nice, but 
	time consuming and the pine people probably have better things
	to do.

But that assumes that the users know how to even write that simple shell 
script.

We have to remember that we are moving into the age of communications, 
where people utilize these computer systems not to program, but to talk.  
Many don't know the first thing about shell scripts or other forms of 
programming.  Their only goal is to read and write information among 
themselves.

Filter, while being limited, has the benefit of the fact that it is also 
very easy to implement (granted, it isn't newbie stuff, but it also 
doesn't require any time to learn scripting techniques and the like)/

Pierre,

You might try "stty -a" at the shell to see if anything is assigned to ^T. 
"ESC ESC t" is a work-around for ^T if you can't get it working otherwise. 

Thanks for the report!

Given that one of the maintainers of elm (home of filter) recommends
that folks use procmail or deliver, yes.

There are significant file locking and consistency issues that filter
doesn't do very well with, that procmail does better than almost
anything.

Procmail's syntax might be daunting for casual users, however.

What would be nice is a program that works like filter with some of the 
rough edges knocked off and that uses c-client for folder access....

Any volunteers?

That is what I consider to be a very serious drawback with procmail, and 
why I eventually abandoned it for filter.  It is just too much of a 
headache and pain in the rear to get the rules writeen and implemented, 
espicially if you are a very novice user.

Filter, with all of it's problems, does function as at least a low-level 
mail sorter.  If you want to do something more fancy than that, well, you 
probably also have the skill to move on to another program.

As always, IMHO.

Subject: Re: Reply-To: in pine 3.89


I hacked in Reply-To in pine 3.07. It's not terribly difficult if you have 
good tools (e.g. cscope).  I put it in the ``rich headers'' by copying the 
code used for bcc.

The nastiest part is modifying the interface to pico so that the reply-to 
header is carried across.

Assuming that 3.89 hasn't changed drastically from 3.07, you should be able to 
change the code in a couple of hours maximum.

If you have your own address installed in your addressbook, you can use 
the usual pine-ish methods of copying that address from the addressbook 
into the bcc header field.

FWIW, the next release of Pine will include support for Reply-To.  A beta 
version should be ready later this spring.

To which I responded: 

I guess that you could always suspend your address book composition, 
browse, and then add to the existing list ...

Does the Pine Team, or anyone else, have anything else to add to this? Is
this a possible feature/enhancement request for a future release of 
Pine :)

When is the following expected to be implemented:

 	  Lastly, Pine can-
          not  display  any attachments which are of the
          "application" type; these  must  be  saved  to
          files and then processed outside of Pine. In a
          future release, we intend to support the mail-
          cap  facility to allow automatic processing of
          display of additional MIME types.

Also, shouldn't it be easy for Pine to support viewing of Postscript 
files in a similar manner to the way it supports image/gif?
This would be a nice next version capability.

Thanks,

Jim,

The next release of Pine _will_ include mailcap support.  There are some 
types mailcap entries that Pine will not be able to handle, but it should 
work for most of the common types.

Thanks for the followup!

Hmmm...  So, basically what you are asking for is to have ^T work in the
CreateList command?  I can see how it would be useful when your addressbook
gets very large.  I'll add this to the requested enhancements list... 

Thanks for the suggestion!

When composing a message in Pico it would be really nice if Ctrl-k (Del 
Line/Cut Text) would only delete from the cursor to the end of the line 
rather than removing the whoel line - just like what Ctrl-k does in 
Emacs. So often I have to advance to somewhere in the middle of the line 
and bang Ctrl-d 15 or more times. If I wanted to delete the whole line I 
could easily move the cursor to the beggining of it by pressing Ctrl-a. 
Anybody else for this change?

   Someone posted that they'd patched in the reply-to header already, but
I accidentally deleted that message.

   Would you be willing to post the patches here, or email privately to

Omi,
There are at least some folks at Pine Central that would be happier with
an emacs-style ^K as well... as it happens, that's what we started with
four years ago, and we soon got feedback that this was not the behavior
novices expected, so we switched. 

We will be investigating the feasibility of having an emacs-style ^K option.

Since pine doesn't know how to rotate sigs yet, to read in a new one, I 
have to go the ^R ^T route... Unfortunately, the only way to get into 
the .sigfiles directory is to type in /home3/zarthac/.sigfiles/ then hit 
^T.  Needless to say this gets annoying.  Could you fix ^T so that either 
I can merely type .sigfiles/ or ~/.sigfiles/ or even have it display . 
files automatically?  thanks

Perhaps I shouldn't jump into this without first having tried filter and
deliver, and whatever else may have been suggested.  But I lean towards
procmail because it is so powerful, and as at least one person mentioned,
safe to use in many different mail formats and systems.  However, it can
be somewhat cryptic, but whether this is bad or good I think is subject to
debate.  What are sys-admins for, anyways?  You'll probably need one to
install the software to begin with.  Besides, if the user wants to filter
mail into different folders, then chances are that she or he is not a true
novice.  And if she or he is a true novice (this happened to me!) then
that person really should have help from a sys-admin. 

Even though I use procmail and recommend it, I don't think that the Pine
team should really be involved.  Frankly, I wouldn't wish the extra hassle
on them because I'd like to see them dedicate that time to Pine itself. 
But since the range of Pine users is so wide, with so many different
levels of expertise and opinions (wow!), I think it would be best to just
make a few suggestions for filtering software and tell where to find the
source code.  I know that elm includes "filter", but it just doesn't seem
right for Pine to follow suit.  We've all heard the discussions about
adding too many features to Pine... besides, the source code is big enough
as it is. :-)

What I might do is include a page in the docs (stick it way in the back)
about filtering software, perhaps with a ***brief*** explanation of the
three (or so) top packages.  I might even describe how to filter incoming
messages from a particular address to a particular folder, and then tell
where to look for more information.  For example: 

    Here is how to filter mail from the Pine Info group into another
    folder using procmail.  Create a .procmailrc file in your home 
    directory with the following lines:

	# Please check if all the paths in PATH are reachable, remove the
	# ones that are not.
	PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/local/bin
	MAILDIR=$HOME/mail      # You'd better make sure it exists
	:0:
	* ^From.*owner-pine-info
	pine-info		# will be saved to $HOME/mail/pine-info

    For more information, see the man page on procmailrc(5), ask your 
    system administrator, or send mail to procmail@informatik.rwth-aachen.de.

There now, that wasn't too painful, was it?  Yes, I know, it's a little
more involved than all that, but you get the idea.  The point is I think
we have enough experienced users/administrators who would be willing to
provide this type of information that the Pine Team could then incorporate
into the documentation. 

	Later!

No, because then you'd have to make sure you were at the beginning of a 
line every time you wanted to delete something...  Why don't you just hit 
Ctrl-^,Ctrl-E,Ctrl-K?  Though it's slight more messy, it works (and I 
don't feel like having to type Ctrl-A Ctrl-K.. =) )...  And by all means, 
if you want Emacs functionality, use emacs!

The last couple of messages came through with a smtp header of pine 3.90 
on them. Did I miss an announcement or is this in-house only?

David:
I am so glad you will add this feature to the new version.  Thank you in
advance.  

Please don't say I am getting greedy.  It will be very helpful if we can
take the address from the incoming mail and add the address directly to
the distribution list.

I would also be very interested in this, as that is why I just subscribed 
to this mail-group. I was also wondering if it is possible to add X-lines 
with pine?

You could always make it a part of growth, could you not? As in 
sapling kills the entire line, while old-growth uses emacs style 
deletion. I think that emacs has become big enough now that many novice 
users will be more familiar with its editing style than 4 years ago.

   More to the point... what will be included in the next release of pine? 
What bug fixes, what new features, etc.?  I am really interested in 
what's new in news reading (like, is posting a new feature?).

If you want to delete from the cursor to the end of the line, jsut press 
return and then ^k.

I rather like Pico the way it is in this regard. Wouldn't it make more 
sense (and be less effort) to just get the feature of Pine implimented 
that will put people directly into their alternative editor so all of 
these people who prefer emacs commands can easily use emacs within Pine 
instead of insisting that Pico be changed?

Just a thought.

I don't think this is a good idea. Even the small changes that have been
made in pine 3.8* have caused local complaints.

Hi,

Is it possible to compile pine with some configuration already set up. I 
mean that i would like the H header option working without having to 
modify the .pinerc or having a pine.conf file???

Pierre

Stephen and Gregory,

The next release of Pine (later this spring) will include support for
Reply-To without any patches.  There will also be some support for extra
headers, though the details of exactly how that will work are not yet
firm. 

Thanks for the request!

Ummm...  I didn't exactly promise this for the next release...

It is "on the list" and I can see how it would be usefull, but it is hard
to tell yet when it will get to the top...

You could always push <Return>-<Control K> to delete from the middle of 
the line.  I like ^K the way it is.

When I am in that situation, I tend to just <return><Ctrl-k> then <delete>
if I want to join the line back up. <Ctrl-j> fixes any reformatting if
necessary. Much simpler than all the <Ctrl-d>'s

Pierre,

Not without some code hacking.  Take a look at pine/init.c...

Scott,

This is strictly in-house.  We usually increment the Message-Id on our 
experimental version shortly after the previous release...

Thanks for the request!

Sherry,

The final feature-list for Pine 3.9x is still a moving target.  Some of 
the major features that have been coded so far include mailcap support, 
news subscription and posting, aggregate operations, and several smaller 
changes.  Implementation of user-definable headers is currently in 
progress.  

Thanks for the request!

I've found a solution to the wait for pine to realize that it's running 
on top of a suspended pine process.  It ignores everything except 
ctrl-\.  (just out of idle curiosity, why is it programmed to ignore ^Z 
while it's looking for the oher process?)  It'll dump core and the other 
process will be read-only, but you can get rid of that pesky 15 second wait..

Yes, that would be nice, so that it can stay simple for the novices, but
can be made to behave EMACS-style for those familiar with EMACS.  The
problem is not that kill-to-end-of-line behaviour is not achievable some
other way, but that an EMACS user's typing ahead fingers incorrigibly
assume that this is what ^K will do..

David,
   I understand about not having a backtab option to tab back through 
incoming folders, however how about not forcing a backtab on people let 
them choose at compile time ? Basically,

   How about adding the backtab as a makefile option ?

While on the subject of next release, I cannot resist asking for more.
As most mailers now support delivery receipts, could this optino be added 
to Pine (that is, the option to request a delivery receipt).  It should 
just be a matter of adding one header line.  Also, maybe it would be nice 
to allow old-growth users the ability to add their own header lines (I 
can see why this would be debatable).

Thanks for the great work.

I agree with this.  I also think you should make it an option because if 
you don't, the question will keep coming up over and over and over and 
over.  I know some people there may be purists about what does or doesn't 
go into Pine, but the simple fact is that adding this as an option would 
eliminate an entire class of email on this mailing list, and as we all 
know, anything which limits the amount of email that you receive is 
good.  (Of course, we would then ask that the same 
emacs-compatibility-flag also enable the meta key. ;-)

I've finally got round to playing with Pine in an MMDF environment 
again.  Some good news some bad news.

First the good news...  I've hacked pine/send.c so that it calls the MMDF 
submit library routines directly (rather than having to interface via the 
MMDF sendmail replacement or over an SMTP connection).  This allows for 
immediate reporting of address errors.  The code is currently being 
tested here but I hope to get something to you soon, hopefully with the 
aim of getting it incorporated into a future release?  (The code changes 
are fairly small and #ifdef in cleanly).

Now the bad news...  I can't get the mmdf driver to work at all on our 
MMDF mailboxes.  Is anyone using these drivers with MMDF update 43 (or 
any other version for that matter)?  The VALID macro (from mmdf.h) is 
looking for a mailbox with messages separated by 4 CTRL-A's, then a 
newline, then a line like "From blah blah blah".  Our mailboxes here 
don't look like that :-(.  They just have the 4 CTRL-A's followed by a 
newline - then you go straight into the message.

I've tried making the VALID macro much simpler (i.e it just checks for
"\001\001\001\001\n") but unfortunately routines like mmdf_parse() appear
to want to do things with that non-existant From line :-(. 

I think I need some explanation of how the "From " line is being used 
and whether mmdf driver routines can be written that don't rely on 
having such a line at the start of each message.  Do any of the other 
drivers not rely on such a line?

BTW, I've been working with the c-client libraries from imap-3.3.  You 
should note that both the mmdf and bezerk drivers include (different) 
definitions of the VALID macro.  This may account for the difficulties in 
trying to use both drivers together?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Andy.

It would not be part of the old-growth macro set of features; it would be 
a separate feature.  This is a personal preference issue that would not 
be universally welcomed even by power users.

-teg

p.s. for those who have suggested that one simply hit return first... 
this will not work in the header.  That's the one place you can't 
simulate the emacs-style behavior via ^M^K.

We need some help with PC-Pine, which we intend to install on our PCs.
We are already using Pine on Unix (me personally since 3.05, and now
it's becoming the default mailer), and have an impad server on one of
the Suns, which we manage to access from the other workstations.

We have now done our first installation on a PC (with FTP Inc. PC-TCP)
and have problems accessing the remote imapd inbox (Pine looks all right,
in fact it can SEND mail without problems).

Our inetd.conf looks like :

#
# for PINE imapd
#
imap stream tcp nowait root /data1/pine/imapd-bin.sun imapd

In addition in /etc we have a link 

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root 25 Mar 24 16:13 rimapd -> /data1/pine/imapd-bin.sun

This link was essential to have access to remote folder working on Unix,
but, as the doc says, is not what is needed for PCs.

What we have done on the PC is : have a PINERC file with all the same
settings as on Unix (pine.conf), plus putting a user-id equal to the
Unix username.

The inbox-path is {helios.ifctr.mi.cnr.it}INBOX

We get error : can't connect to helios.ifctr.mi.cnr.it,143 Refused (61)

(It's imapd, because we can e.g. telnet to host helios, or send mail
via smtp-server kronos). By the way mail outgoing from the PC says
"UNauthenticated mail".

I have read the documentation, found mentions of a password, and of
a file PINE.PWD (but not of its content), but we are NEVER prompted
any password (and the Setup Newpassword option is n/a to PCs).

We tried some fudges with .rhosts and hosts.equiv, but with no success.
Could you provide us any clue ?

I'm sending this in reply to a colleague which is looking after the
PC business (I'm on the Unix end). Please reply in cc: to him too, since
I'm away tomorrow.
Thanks.

Keith,
The problem is that (Unix) Pine is constrained to deal with ascii, and 
backtab is not an ascii character, nor does it seem to  have a universal 
definition via a sequence of characters (ala arrow keys.)  Also, unless a 
key is *very* widely available on keyboards, trying to add support 
for it leads to serious support headaches for us. 

If this impression is incorrect, please let us know, and we can look at
the issue again.

It is indeed debatable, but we've pretty much caved in on trying to hold 
the line on user-defined headers.  Details later, after we are further 
along with the new code...

Hi There,

Any hope of seeing pine for ....  MSWindows?  I love pine but I am now 
running through a slip account in Windows so I am stuck with PCEudora for 
now.  I miss some of the functionality of pine but I really like using a 
graphical editor.  PCPine is not going to work with winsock, or is it?

Anyway, If someone out htere knows of a good windows mail prog. until Pine 
is available (that will be a long wait).  Let me know.


thanks,
Dan

I would like to second this request. For important e-mail, one likes to

I would like to remark that the reception of a requested delivery receipt
does not mean the mail reached its destination.  Picture an SMTP gateway that
receives the SMTP mail and then forwards it to its actual destination --
could be a cc:Mail system ...  The receipt would be sent out from the 
SMTP gateway sysytem which does not mean the message got to the cc:Mail 
mailbox.  Also, there are still systems that do not generate return 
receipts.

However, as I am the one that requested the receipt request in Pine, I do 
recognize that it would be a nice feature.  Once you understand the 
system you are sending mail to, you can learn how to interpretate the 
receipt.

Wim,

The next release of Pine will include metamail support, though not quite 
everything in mailcap is currently supported.

Thanks for the request!

   How can I set the initial folder for the 'Goto' command to be something
other than my first folder collection in 'folder-collections'?  I'd MUCH
rather it was the Incoming folder collection instead.

   I've recently reorganized my mail directory into a couple
subdirectories in the hopes of getting a bit more organized.

   So I created an Incoming directory which contains all my filtered
incoming mail files, an Archives which contains mail I got a while back
but still want to hang onto for a bit, and Sent which contains my sent
mail. My .pinerc looks something like this:

inbox-path=Mail/Incoming/atchity
incoming-folders=friends Mail/Incoming/friends,
        work Mail/Incoming/work
folder-collections=Sent Mail/Sent/[],
        Archives Mail/Archive/[]

When I fire up pine, I see folder 'Mail/Incoming/atchity' as I want.
HOWEVER, I then want to type 'g' (for GOTO), then 'work', and see my
work-related mail.  However, it goes like this instead:
    GOTO folder in <Sent> : work
    [No such file or directory: Mail/Sent/work]

Lucio,

The imapd configuration on your server (helios) is not correct.  A simple 
test is to telnet to port 143 on the server, e.g. 

	telnet helios.ifctr.mi.cnr.it 143

There are variations between different versions of Unix in the specific 
configuration of inetd, so it is hard to give specific advice without 
more information.

Thanks for the report!

Dan,

We currently have someone working on a winsock version of Pine.  For now it
will look just like PC-Pine and will not have any GUI.  We are hoping to have
something available this summer. 

Thanks for the request!

We do not have an imap server.  We cannot use PC Pine.  Any suggestions
besides the imap server?

Debbi,

We are currently working on a winsock-compatible version of Pine.  We are 
hoping to have something available for testing this summer.

Thanks for the request!

Elmar,

All well and good.  Unfortunately, from the requests I have seen for a 
"filter" capability (including many to pine-bugs), it is apparent that 
the people who are requesting this capability are the ones who would 
never be able to figure out procmail.  Even something like "filter" would 
require a fair amount of hand-holding if it were routinely installed as 
part of the Pine distribution.

It would be good to have something like you suggest in the yet-to-be-written
Pine FAQ though.  Would you be willing to flush out your example section for
possible inclusion? 

Thanks for the suggestion!

That is pretty much my view of things.  Putting it in a FAQ is a Good 
Idea!  Yes, I'd be glad to contribute, just let me know!

PC-Pine (and the upcoming winsock port) do require IMAP.  We do not have any
short term plans to support PC-Pine without an IMAP server either.  Sorry.

To be honest, I don't get much of a chance to read much pine-info mail 
due to being incredible busy at work, as well as the high volume of the 
list. Here at UofM, we're buying in big to the IMAP/Pine system. I'm 
currently working with a team very interested in setting up socket-based 
IMAP filters. Is anybody else working on the same? If so, I would be very 
interested in starting to a separate "IMAP Server protocols" list 
for this sort of discussion. Of particular interest to me, and many of 
the people I work with, are object oriented programs and various perl 
scripts (perl5 being the ideal, of course). Thanks.

Richard,

You might want to take the IMAP discussion to the imap@cac.washington.edu 
discussion list.  That is where you will find the real IMAP expertise.  
To subscribe, send a message to imap-request@cac.washington.edu.  It is 
manually maintained so the format of the request is not important.

Thanks for the request!

Henry,

You can set up as many News collections as you want on the news-collestions
entry in your .pinerc file.  Note that they will all use the same .newsrc
file... 

Thanks for the request!

If the set of new features in then next pine release is not locked, yet,
I'd like to make a suggestion: support for RFC 1522 (using non-ASCII
characters in headers).  This is something our users miss badly.

Sir,

I originally sent the following message to 
owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu and had a pleasant reply from David 
Miller who advised me to look at comp.mail.mime FAQ and to get in touch 
with you.

I have looked at the mime FAQ but didn't really find what I was looking for.

Could you possibly point me to where I might find some fairly basic 
information on BASE64. Also if you have received queries on Pine features 
(or possible lack of them!) I'd be grateful if you could pass them (and 
of course your answers) onto me.

I attach my original message for your information

Sir,

I have managed to find some messages relating to queries about BASE64 
encoding and was wondering if there was an FAQ dealing with this and 
other Pine related issues. I've tried searching using gopher but have had 
no luck.

If there is such an FAQ I'd be grateful if you could let me know where it 
is to be found.

I'm very impressed with Pine, and for my sins I'm supposed to be the 
expert here, but there is still an awful lot I'm not sure about. Any good 
pointers would be gratefully received.

Yours faithfully,

Colette Monaghan

	To learn about Base64 encoding reference rfc1521 starting on page
21.  It has a very good discussion.

					Regards,

P.S.	As for features/lack of features/bugs in pine....this is the
	ongoing discussion group that you posted this message to.
	You should be aware that pine has no bugs....only "undocumented
	features".  :-) :-)

Greg,
We will be looking at providing more options on what the default 
collection context is for GOTO.  Until then, you need to press ^P 
before entering the folder name "work" in your example below.

Is this a pine related listserv? If so, can I get subsribed to it?

I posted this question in comp.mail.mime couple of days ago and got no 
respone, so I hope to get it here.

I'd like to be able to invoke some shell scripts on some of my plain 
text e-mail messages. It would be ideal to for me to find a way to 
replace Pine's builtin text viewer with my own. How can I do this?

Can I declare my own Attachment type - viewer pair? I tried to use 
printer option, but didn't succeed because of the weird line-by-line 
output.

Thanks for help.
