Two questions:

1.  Is Pine going to encode its headers according to RFC1522 any time 
soon?  I could give you code to encode a header, but I'm not going to 
wade into Pine to find out where to insert the calls to it.
 
2.  Pine does not currently offer the "fcc by first recipient"-style save
elm offers, and it doesn't seem easy to add without knowledge of Pine.  Do
you think it's a bad idea?

Regarding the comp.mail.pine creation, if anyone had problems with getting 
mail to vote@lm.com, you can try again now, some problems have been fixed.

Dear Pine Team,

one of our users complained that he cannot use the cursor keys
of his notebook inside pine.
For example, when he is composing a message with pico
cursor-left gives "t"
cursor-right gives "v"
cursor-up gives "x"
cursor-down gives "r"

However in other applications the cursor keys behave as they should.

Can you please help us with some hints?

Thanks

But it should be noted that:-
a) Mailstrom is a TOTAL disaster - it does *not* obey proper IMAP 
comventions, and is maintained part-time by someone whose actual job does 
NOT include Mailstrom.
As a result, despite the user interface being very nice, we have been 
forced to discontinue recommending Mailstrom to our MAC users.
We have no second best at present, though we do have POP customers using 
Eudora (also not 100% satisfactory).
I believe that ECS-mail either has or will have a MAC client.

b) ECS-mail is expensive, and PINE and Mailstrom are free.

Our Mac person here has been experimenting with beta copies, which
seem to work OK (I don't know much about it).

> b) ECS-mail is expensive, and PINE and Mailstrom are free.

I was told the Windows version was only $24 (CND), which I thought
to be quite reasonable.  It's not as good as free (and I do like
Pine better), but for people who want a native Windows mail
reader, it's a goo, inexpensive product. (My opinion).

There is a recent addition to the set of available Mac IMAP clients.  It's
called "Mail Drop".  From the file /mail/imap.software on
ftp.cac.washington.edu here is the contact info: 

 Baylor University: (Mail Drop)
     FTP: ackmo.baylor.edu: /pub/bell/Mail_Drop
     MailDrop-Comments@baylor.edu

It is very simple, but from the few tests I performed seemed to be stable.
MIME support is not there yet, but promised.

CHARTER

  This group is for discussion about use and development of the Pine
mail/news user agent developed by the University of Washington.  Any
Pine-related and Pine-specific discussion is acceptable, but general
discussion regarding e.g. MIME or incoming-mail filters is referred to
other, more appropriate newsgroups.
  The group is not moderated.  To be made moderated, the same procedure
should be followed as for the creation of a new group at that time.
  The group is bidirectionally gatewayed to the mailing list
pine-info@cac.washington.edu.

HOW TO VOTE

Send MAIL to:   vote@lm.com
Just Replying should work if you are not reading this on a mailing list.

      I vote YES on comp.mail.pine
      I vote NO on comp.mail.pine

You may also ABSTAIN in place of YES/NO - this will not affect the outcome.
Anything else may be rejected by the automatic vote counting program.  The
votetaker will respond to your received ballots with a personal acknowledge-
ment by mail - if you do not receive one within several days, try again.
It's your responsibility to make sure your vote is registered correctly.

I'd like to underscore the need for a Mac IMAP client.  Pleae comment on:

What do the folks at UW use?  Must be unix pine via telnet??

Can we get any better status information on Mailstrom 2.0 and/or Pine 3.8x?

I've seen Mailstrom 2.0 and it had a nice look & feel, but crashed.
Mark Crispin should be encouraged by the fact that many would be pleased
as punch to just have a key-stroke driven mac version.. i.e no need to do
massive re-design (seriously).

What about using a cross-platform environment with the motif version to
elicit a mac version??

Mail_Drop crashes on launch on my Mac II running System 6.0.8.  :^(

Help!  People here are testing Pegasus!  :^)

Using unix pine from Mac is crazy man!   (I use unix pine in IMAP mode)

Regarding imap Mac mail clients ... is there a general consensus about the
accuracy of Barry's Lany's comments about Mailstrom.  

This is the first I had heard of problems with its imap implementation. 
Although this is a pine list (and the Pine team does a fantastic job of
providing information such as Terry Gray's recent mention of an addition
to the Mac imap agents) I'd like a little more background on Mailstrom
problems.  I'd be especially interested in hearing from campuses who have 
used Mailstrom.

Macs are certainly the biggest hole in the IMAP tapestry...

A mixture of things.  Some do indeed use NCSA Telnet to connect to a Unix
host and run Pine.  Others have had fair success with Mailstrom on certain
platforms. 
 
> Can we get any better status information on Mailstrom 2.0 and/or Pine 3.8x?

I have heard nothing from Adam Treister, Mailstrom's author, in quite a 
few months, but I am not on the mailstrom email lists.

While not relevant to the Mac problem, the next release of Pine will be 
version 3.90 and we are still hoping for Beta "by late Spring".

Just for clarification for those who don't know: Mark has nothing to do
with Mailstrom, other than providing imap technical assistance to Adam... 
However Mark did express interest in porting Pine to his Mac in his spare
time, but I don't think he's had a chance to pursue this lately.

I'm sure there is merit in this approach, but there are some 
alligators to watch out for as well.

What can I say?  We can't do everything...

Know any Mac gurus looking for a project?

I dont think this is the place to flame Mailstrom. We struggled for 9 
months to provide a proper service, and as the result of a number of 
different problems, and after a lot of work, we decided we could not spare 
any further effort to a lost cause - and yes, we did try (several) beta 
versions. The killer for us is the unofficial nature of the product, so 
that (unlike Pine) there is no guaranteed support.

yes, about $20 per seat. A lot of seats = a lot of money. A site licence 
was quoted at abut 20,000. For UK readers, I understand that CHEST are 
licensing it.

The current "best guess" on Pine 3.90 is still "late spring."  The most
optimistic estimate is the end of this month.  I won't speculate on a
pessimistic estimate ;)

   This may not be the proper list for this question but I was not sure 
where else to post it.  Since upgrading to a new OS, e-mail addresses to 
our site have been case sensitive.  If the user name is not in all 
lowercase letters, the mail is not deliverable.  My sendmail.cf file does 
NOT have the F=u option for local mail (the Mlocal line).  I cannot find 
any other reference to case sensitivity in my Sendmail books.  It appears 
that unless F=u is specified, the address should be converted to all 
lower-case for the rules.  Is it then my system that is refusing the mail 
(outside of sendmail)?  Or am I missing something in the sendmail.cf 
file?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in Advance :-)

We have some difficulty at present sending from our Internet system to
bitnet addresses. The method is to address the message to a mailhost in
Berkeley that translates the Internet message to the bitnet system.  The
form that we use is: 

	@mailhost.berkeley.edu:bitnet_address.bitnet

Our system administrator has not been able to find a way that format to 
be used from within pine on our system, which is a DEC Alpha running 
OSF/1.  We can use the regular OSF/1 mail program to send it without a 
problem.

We would appreciate any information about why pine and mail handle this 
address differently, and what solutions may be available.  We very much 
like pine and would like to be able to handle all our email messages 
through pine.

John,

To be a valid source-routed address, you need to enclose the whole thing 
in "<>", i.e.

	<@mailhost.berkeley.edu:bitnet_address.bitnet>

You can also try the form

	user%node.bitnet@mailhost.berkeley.edu

which I believe is the preferred form on the Internet.  

I hope that helps!

You are correct. The deletion of F=u should be sufficient to allow mail
sent to any case to be deliverable. There is nothing else in sendmail.cf.
If you recently removed F=u - did you refreeze sendmail.cf (sendmail -bz) ?

You could post to the newsgroup comp.mail.sendmail (along with a fuller
problem description e.g. the error message from sendmail,OS). That would be
a more knowledgeable arena for this problem.

Is there anyway one might be able to add "finger" capabilities to PINE?  
many of our users find it difficult to remember the name of someone on 
our system, and would like the ability to find out the address name 
without actually EXITING pine.  

This also brings to mind the question...is there a way that users can 
shell out of pine to run things on the command line (other than by using 
"suspend")

I think this need would be better satisfied with a global address book / 
directory service.  It is the most glaring missing feature of PINE.

PINE is very good at keeping users away from the operating system, and 
adding shell escapes would be a mistake.

This would be a definite plus...no doubt there.

If it were a "compilable" option maybe?

finger, (perhaps tucked away in the addressbook - f key "spare" at the 
moment,) would be very useful for us too. 

[BTW finger at our site (many Suns running YP) can take about a minute to
report given a surname - does this square with others' experience?]

Not sure what you mean by one or the other, but on our system, the way I 
found I had to get multiple inbound folders available was by setting 
.pinerc to 444 before firing up pine....otherwise it would keep losing 
the comma after the first inbox :(

But to get the remote inboxes was simply:


# inbox-path specifies the name/path/location of your INBOX.  Example:
# inbox-path={carson.u.washington.edu}inbox (INBOX on a remote computer)
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /user/spool/mail/$USER)
inbox-path=

# incoming-folders are those other than INBOX that receive new messages.
# Folder syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}folder-path
# Use only if you filter incoming email into multiple files or receive
# email on several different machines.
# Example:
# incoming-folders=Consulting       {carson.u.washington.edu}filter/to-help,
#                  Widget-Project   {carson.u.washington.edu}filter/to-widget,
#                  Old-Student-Acct {imap.berkeley.edu}inbox
incoming-folders=ASL4		{asl4}INBOX,
	ASL3		{asl3}INBOX

Where asl3 and asl4 are hosts on our network.  Good luck.  Hope that 
helps.  It certainly is a great feature.

Alan,

Yes, you can have both local and remote folders.  Can you send a copy of 
a .pinerc file you have configured for both, but is failing?

Sorry about the delay!

I don't think this is a good idea.  "Finger" is only helpful if all
users are on one system (unless you expect users to remember host names
as well). At many sites, this is simply not the case.

I agree with Paul Maclauchlan -- PINE needs a global address book, it's
the biggest thing that is missing.

Preferrably standards based?  X.500/LDAP (that's what NASA uses)?  PH?

Yes.  Our site has about 5000 users in our yp passwd map and finger can

Pine should not read your .newsrc file unless a news collection is

Given that there are so many to choose from, and sites vary in which they 
support (look me up in X.500 and compare with my real address below!), 
perhaps a sensible approach would be to put a hook into pine to run an 
external program, which could then be finger, whois or whatever.

(OK so that wouldn't integrate seamlessly with Pine's address book, but 
it would give at least some functionality - and be quick and easy for the 
pine folks to get out the door!)

Can you figure out what escape sequences are generated by the cursor 
keys.  Pine uses a hard-coded keyboard mapping, so it is possible that 
your user's terminal emulation is generating sequences we have not seen 
before...

Oh yeah?  Since when do we *guarantee* support for Pine? ;)

Our support might be better than what some commercial companies do, but keep
in mind that we are funded only to support the UW community and anything else
is just "making Pine better for UW users."  Outside support could dry up 
overnight if someone decides it is a waste of taxpayers' money....

Now, with that bit of a reality-check done, next suggestion?

The other problem with finger is the increasing use of aliases (such as
postoffice.utas.edu.au). Hooks for, or client code embedded, to contact a
ph (CSO) server would be more useful.

Mailstrom has *no* staff permanently assigned to its maintenance, which 
compares unfavourably to PINE, which at least for the time being has a 
team in place which has the mission of maintaining and developing PINE 
for the benefit of the U of W, and we can all reasonably expect to 
benefit by riding on the coat-tails of the U of W.

I am sure that the Pine team (and therefore U of W) benefit from the
larger sample of user feedback (and therefore make a better Pine) but
at some cost. I am sure that the knowledgeable users around the world 
feed in ideas and even code. And, as we all know, doing good is its own
reward (the U of W is, of course, world famous as a result of Pine :-) ).

                     """""     Wot - U of W - yeah

                |     |     |     |
But perhaps, before Pine gets dragged down by the coat tails we should all
ask (and the Pine team should think about) how does the wider user
community support in-house projects made more generally available, and
support Pine in particular. There's a lot of good will but I don't have any
good ideas, and perhaps it has to come from the Pine team since they are
the only ones who know the costs/benefits and pressures.

	Hello! I am writting from The Basque Country, in Spain. We have
problems with the PC-Pine when using the packet drivers for ODI (we can't 
connect with the port 25, for example). Someone knows if the PC-Pine only 
works with the "pure" packet drivers?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

	I would like to setup imap to behave as rimap. However, the doc 
says that I have to have rimap in /etc. Checking the in imap2.c shows 
that the filename is hardcoded. I tried to change it to something else 
but it doesn't work (still expects from /etc/rimap since as soon as I put 
it back in there it works).

	Is there a way to make imap to work as rimap such that rimap is 
in somewhere else (like /usr/local/etc/rimap)?

	Thanks in advance

Chee Wai

I use PC Pine with a packet driver - but not with ODI. Is there an 
ODI-to-packet shim that you are using?

A useful program to test your packet driver is trypktd, which comes with 
NuPOP (I can mail you a copy if you like) - it scans the interrupt list 
looking for a packet driver so you can at least tell if that is working. 

Incidentally (someone correct me if I am wrong), I don't think PINE uses 
port 25 (smtp) - it should use port 143 (imap).

PC-Pine uses both: smtp for sending, imap for reading/saving.  (And
optionally, nntp for reading --and soon, posting-- news.)

Unix Pine has the option of handing outgoing messages directly to the 
local sendmail, but it can also be configured to use smtp for sending.

using,  but when I write a message and try to send it I get the

Since I don't know much about how mail works in VMS I cannot locate

Chee,

If you change the location of rimapd, you have to change all of the _clients_
that will be using it (e.g. pine).  This means that you have to change all of
the Pine clients that will be accessing that server via rimap....

I hope that helps!

Of course, the entry in /etc/ can be a *link* to wherever the real 
executable lives.

When release 3.90 of pine comes out (in Late Spring :-) ), will there be 
a newer release of PC-Pine too.

Any info on "What's new - improved" in the next release?

Sherry,

Yes, all versions of Pine and PC-Pine will be released simultaneously.  The
only exception is the ports that are not included in the main distribution
(e.g. VMS).

I would really appreciate the inclusion of a version of pico which uses
either the ANSI codes that the IBM-PC knows about or vt100 screen
addressing, so that I can make pico running on my PC accessible via modem.

Cheers
John

Hi,
  Are there any plans to add Hot-key sequence to "quick-move to beginning of 
mail" or end of mail in Pine 3.90 ? I find myself pressing ^Y or ^V many 
times while browsing really long mails ?

Thanks
Prem

Your message was read in Michigan from Washington DC via IMAP from
the machine in Ko=B9ice, Slovakia, where it appeAAAAAAAGH!!  SHUT UP!
It was NOT!!!!@!

    Ooops, sorry about that.  Ahem.  As Pine will function happily
as a SMTP client, making a connection to perhaps a different machine
to pass along a mail message, will the next release of Pine, or one
upcoming shortly, have ESMTP support for 8BITMIME?

    I know the U Washington still relies on IDA 5.65 on most of its
machines, but from headers I can see that Pine is seeing widespread
usage at many schools which speak EHLO, having upgraded to BSD sendmail
8.6.whatever, and even the latest ZMailer, which is installed on my
machine in Slovakia, speaks ESMTP, and this would be a good chance
for me to be distracted by that.

    The advantage of Pine as an ESMTP client, for those who do not
know, would be that it could pass a message as 8-bit text, rather than
converting it to QUOTED-PRINTABLE or BASE64, with the resulting
increase in message size.  Then, if I need to mail images from Europe
to my friends at the U of Michigan, it would consume no more bandwidth
than an FTP transfer, rather than being 4/3 the size of the attachment.
Of course, if the server does not speak ESMTP, Pine would send the
message as it does now with SMTP.  The Crack Pine Team could only get
BASE64-encoded pictures, instead of a BINARY transfer, until upgrading.

    If I understand this right, this could only work when Pine passes
the message off with SMTP (ESMTP) rather than handing it off to the
sendmail program directly, since Pine would have no way of knowing
whether the sendmail supports 8BITMIME without actually talking to it.
For users who prefer to have the local machine do the delivery with
sendmail, rather than speaking SMTP to it, I suppose there could be a
system-wide configuration option which could be set if some MIME-aware
sendmail is installed on the system.  However, this would lead to
difficulties if the value is set and the sendmail does not truly speak
ESMTP, such as IDA 5.65 or whatever, perhaps compiled for an 8-bit-clean
path, since it would not know how to convert the message to a 7-bit
transfer method if the machine it speaks to does not handle 8BITMIME.
(There are quite a few people who believe all that is necessary to be
able to handle 8-bit mail safely is to configure their sendmail for an
8-bit-clean path, but that's not enough, and permitting Pine to speak
8-bit without verifying that the mailer can convert to a 7-bit transfer
method would go against MIME, so it's probably best to use the 8-bit
transfer only when configured as an ESMTP client.)

    So, I just thought I'd ask to see when this would be supported,
to help Pine take fuller advantage of the MIME-aware mailers that are
becoming increasingly common...

Hi,

I know that the osf port is unsupported code, but here goes.

I compiled the 3.89 release on OSF/1 V2.0 on a DEC3000/400, it compiled 
with no errors. When I invoke Pine, it starts the main menu, but when it 
gets to the bottom line, it crashes:

Bug in Pine detected: "Out of free storage".
Exiting Pine
Abort process (core dumped)

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks,

Chris

Chris,

This may be a bug having to do with a bogus header line in one of the
messages in your INBOX.  The specific situation I saw cause this was an
address consisting of a single '\' character.  This bug will be fixed in the
next release of Pine and in the c-client found in the latest imap.tar.Z found
on ftp.cac.washingotn.edu. 

Thanks for the report!

Subject: pine and /etc/aliases


I'm running pine 3.89 on a Sun Sparc 2 with SunOS 4.1.2 (I did a "build
sun").  My problem is with the "To:" field under compose message.  I have
a rather extensive /etc/aliases list with all the people here and their
e-mail addresses.  Whenever I send a message to user "abc" the To field is
completed as "abc@logos.res.utc.com".  This is MY node and NOT the remote
node of the recipient from /etc/aliases.  The aliases list is seemingly
ignored.  (I should mention that /etc/aliases is "-rw-r--r--" and am running
the newest sendmail v8.)

Is this correct operation or how can I fix it to use the
aliases?  Is there a tool to convert /etc/aliases to the address book
format?

It seems that Pine 3.89 does not forward MIME e-mail
messages that have a body part with a 
content-transfer-encoding: of x-uuencode properly.  When you
try to forward such a message, that body part ends up with
a content-transfer-encoding: of x-unknown.  Is this a bug,
or some subtlety of MIME that I am not aware of?

I am running Pine on a SUN system running sun os 4.1.3, As the people who 
have tried the sun sparcstations, when in "textmode" screenupdates are 
extremly sloow.

So some1 have done a small program called tconsole, wich allows you to 
change font, fontsize and so on in "textmode". It also allows you to 
change the character "resolution", from the normal 80x25(?) to 130x60 or 
something like that, but pine don't notice that. (but emacs does).

Any hints? Anything I have missed, you have missed? Should I try to edit 
something like our termcap database?

Subject: Re: pine and /etc/aliases

Thanks for your response.  To fill in some details:

I have a line in /etc/aliases such as:
abc: abc@utrc.a1.utc.com

newaliases has been run.

In .pinerc both user-domain and smtp-server are blank.

In the compose window in the To: field I type "abc" and a tab.  The field
completes as abc@logos.res.utc.com.  "logos" is the node where I am
sending from.  I would have hoped the field would complete from /etc/aliases
as "abc@utrc.a1.utc.com"

If I use Sun's mailtool "abc" is left alone and /etc/aliases directs
the message correctly.  With pine I need to type in the full address
myself and I lose the alaises functionality!

Any help would be appreciated.

Scenario:

   First time user. Never ran Pine before

   Executes command to send mail from command line:
   
   Example:    "pine someusername"

Problem:

   Mail directory is not created. Therefore, when user goes to send the
message, it is rejected because Mail/sent-mail doesn't exist, and it 
can't create it because Mail/ doesn't exist.  Can't postpone message
either. It says...

[Error opening folder "/user/home/path/Mail/postponed-mail"]

(I compiled in the default mail dir as Mail/ and not mail/ )

Work-Around:

   Tell user to run pine with no args, at least the first time.  To
rescuse their mail, they need to turn on rich-headers and get rid of
the Fcc: line

Version:

   3.87 on DG/UX 5.4R3.00

Other platforms:

   I was able to reproduce the postpone error message on a Sun 4.1.x 
system. But NOT able to reproduce the error by default on that machine.
I *believe* it is because the admin on that machine must have not compiled
in sent-mail support by default. If I manually create a .pinerc and 
specifically define sent-mail folder, I get the same error as noted above.

Don't count on 3.89 making the problems go away.  We are on DG/UX 5.4.2 
and pine 3.89.  Same problems...not ALL the time :(  So much for 
reproducible bug.  Usually I just tell the user to run pine again and it 
creates the directory...

I didn't investigate it further since it seemed that once the second run 
has been done, all is fine (strange)

Is there an FAQ for this mailing list?

I am trying to get info on how to change the Content-Type in
the message that I am sending. I want to include two file
attachments, one is a postscript file the other is an rtf file.
How do change the Content-Type to application/postscript? And
what is the correct Content-Type for rtf files?


Thanks,
Greg

I'm running solaris2.3 on a spar10.  I'm using pine3.89.  I'm trying 
to default users' incoming mails to their home directory ie 
/home/username instead of /var/mail/username

Must I change something in pine or in my sendmail or my MAIL setting?

Could some unix gurus out there please help??  Thanks!!

Hi,

	does pine have the equivalent of /usr/ucb/mail's "x" command 
which quits mail WITHOUT touching the inbox? How can I emulate such feature?

Thanks

Hi,

It would be great if, just like I can hit "g" to go to any mail folder, I 
could hit "G" to go to any newsgroup.  That would make it much easier to 
traverse the "pine environment" as it were...

Hi,

Will there be a way to modify/enter the fields of the mail header, such
as 'Reference', 'Return-Receipt-To', etc in the next release of Pine ?

Any news about the X version of Pine ?

Thanks

Don't specify a "read-messages" folder.  Then when you "q" it will keep 
all mail in the inbox, as mail would.

Bruce,

You can go to any folder in any collection with "g".  Use the ^N/^P keys to

Pine is NOT happy with our Wyse Terminals.  It won't use the cursor 
keys.  Is it the terminfo is wrong or the proogram?  

OS (DG/UX 5.4.2)

Help...those less technically inclined aren't overjoyed at using ^N etc 
to move around :(

suggestions??

Yes, Pine 3.90 will support configurable headers.  I haven't heard

Pine's newsreader doesn't seem to understand cross-postings.  If I post 
to "xxx,yyy,zzz", three newsgroups comma-seperated, then I should only 
need to read one of those newsgroups, and the other related newsgroups 
should be updated as a matter of course.  Pine, not seeing this, causes 
me to have to see the same article in each of the different newsgroups.  
Is this something that will be in 3.90?

Actually, the "x" command in ucb mail exits the program without changing
the status of any messages (new messages are still new, deletions are not
recorded...).  As far as I know, the closest you can get to that in Pine
is to press Q and then answer N to the question of "Expunge the NNN
deleted messages from INBOX?"  This still will leave you with a modified 
mailbox, but only the Status line will be changed.

Brian,

Pine does not use terminfo to read the keyboard.  The problem is that Pine
already uses the control characters sent by Wyse 50 terminals for other
commands.  To read the Wyse 50 cursor keys we would have to disable other
functions, which we are not willing to do.  Sorry.

Presently, when mail comes my way, xbiff lets me know about it, but pine 
doesn't know about it, and I can't force it to, until it does its 
periodic check for mail.  Is it possible to have a command which allows 
the user to do a manual check in such cases?  It really does drive me a 
little batty, knowing that I have mail, but can't read it because I have 
to wait for the scheduled mail checker to inform my process that it is there.

Typing ctrl-l not only clears the screen it checks the mail spool, 
updating pine.

I believe that's a 3.89 thing, since when we had 3.87, the way to force a 
manual update of mail was going past the last piece of mail in the mail 
Index so that Pine beeped at you twice.

	Does pine use terminfo to write to the screen?  I can't get pine 
to run with my terminal (although pico runs) and I was thinking of 
beefing up the terminal information in the hopes of running it.  Is that 
a dead end?

This is unfortunate, does anyone know of an emulation mode that the WYSE 
will do (these are actually WYSE 160's) that will get along with pine 
better, or are there any plans afoot to make key/command a definable 
choice at compile time?

My site has been using 3.07 for a while, and when 3.90 comes out I'm
considering upgrading us to it. But I logged into another one of my
accounts recently, where they installed 3.85, and something is troubling me.

Imagine my surprise when my messages were in my box in the opposite order
in which I am used to them. I thought, well, no problem, this must be a
settable attribute, right? But there didn't seem to be any way of editing
my .pinerc to automatically put the messages in what I consider to be
their normal order. Sure, I can resort it every time, but that seems
silly. 

It seems perverse to me that anyone would want their messages in this
order. If you're trying to follow a discussion, you get all the aftermath
before you ever figure out what's going on in the first place. (This is
the same problem I have with the "old-style-reply" being what I consider
to be normal, where you have the quoted text first and the response
afterwards. It's difficult to read the messages from the Pine team on this
list because they all start with your answer to the question, and then I
have to page down to figure out what the question was, then go back up to
understand the answer in context. But at least I can set this attribute on
my own mail. Who decided this was desirable, and why, just as a history
question?) It seems obscene that I would be forced to read my messages
this way without it being a settable parameter. 

Am I missing something obvious? I'd hate to be stuck on 3.07 just because
of this one tiny missing requirement.

Yes, pine does use terminfo for output, but only a fairly limited set of
attributes.  Unfortunately pine and pico do not share the same screen
drivers, so differences do exist in some ports....

No, there is no such feature.  In fact, pine periodically checkpoints the 
file as it goes so that you won't lose any changes.  There is no way to 
go back to the way it was when you started.  If you know you want to do 
this ahead of time, you can open the folder read-only by specifying the 
-o command line flag.  In that case, no changes will be made to the folder.

The default sort order for the Index has not changed; it continues to be
Arrival order, i.e. the order that messages were appened to the folder. 

In recent versions you can select a default sort order for the Index view 
of the folder:

# sort-key= order in which messages will be presented...
sort-key=

There are several choices, including "reverse" which I'd guess is the one 
you encountered and didn't like.

As to there being only one obvious/true/correct way of sorting the Index,
Trust us, there are plenty of folks who would be very disappointed if
this option went away.

Well, we're all glad that it's a settable parameter, then, right?

As with Index sorting, the question of what style of Reply is "correct" is
*highly* subjective, with proponents for more variations than you can
imagine.  My own view is that whether the response should be above or
below the original text depends on two things: the length of the original
text, and the expected time interval between sending and receiving.  If
the original text is short, I prefer the response below; otherwise above
--especially if the time constant is short.  I surely do *not* want to
scroll through a long history of a dialogue to get to the bottom line
answer... that would annoy me at least as much as the opposite case annoys
you! 

Anyway, different strokes for different folks...

OK. Let me explain my confusion then, as I think I may have asked the
wrong question.

I sent three messages to myself at this other site. I looked in the mail
spool where my incoming messages are, and there they are in the order I
sent them in, 1, 2, and 3. When I call Pine to open up my inbox, It
displays them 3, 2, and 1. 

> In recent versions you can select a default sort order for the Index view 
> of the folder:

Right now, the "sort-key" entry in my .pinerc is blank, which means it
defaults to "arrival" as you said, although it doesn't appear to be that
way in practice. (I tried putting "reverse" in there, even though it's not
listed as one of the options, and got the same behavior.)

> As to there being only one obvious/true/correct way of sorting the Index,

I never suggested this. I only said that, to me, it was weird, and to not
be able to set it was extremely frustrating. 

> Well, we're all glad that it's a settable parameter, then, right?

Well, I am, if you can tell me how to set it. What am I doing wrong?

> *highly* subjective,

Of course. But I would like a history lesson anyways, as up until I was
introduced to the Pine world, all of my communications (both from me and
to me) read the "old-style" way. The name implies that *it* was the
default once, and since then it has been changed to what it is now. I'm
just curious.

We use Wyse 150's set with vt100 emulation quite a bit here, in addition
to pc's. As far as I know there have been no problems with that emulation
and pine.

I prefer the "old style" too.  I think the advent of the "new style" can be attributed to two things. 
1) some people tend to over quote.
2) some people tend to quote out of context.

With 'new style" reply you can leave the whole message in your reply without having to worry about pageing through 4 pages to get to the answer.  This allows people to get to the meat of a message that is over quoted. It also prevents out of context quoting.  however it is quite annoying that many people don't bother to even delete the sig from quoted material.  It can also be very difficult to follow point by point arguments in "new style" replys.

cheers,
Dan

Adam, 
One possible explanation is that the system manager for that site may have
made sort-key=reverse the default for the site (by putting it in the
global pine.conf file.)

I'm not entirely sure how to over-ride this particular variable in your 
personal .pinerc...  You might try: sort-key=""  or maybe sort-key=arrival

I don't think Pine invented the "above" style, but it is certainly the
less common default.  The Pine-specific history is not mysterious:  the
original group involved in defining requirements for Pine (including some
users) felt that the "above" style was preferable.  As I indicated before,
when you are part of a back-and-forth dialogue from the beginning, the
last thing in the world you want to do is scroll thru all of the history
of the conversation to find the latest addition at the bottom... but if
you are CC'd at the end of the discussion, I agree that chrono order is
more convenient --until the next reply forces you to scroll thru the stuff
you've already seen to get to the newest addition. 

But again, "standards vary"... which is why it's been an option since the 
earliest versions.

sort-key=arrival did the trick! Thanks! Your help is very much appreciated.

Thanks for this. The overall point of this, I think, is that most people
can't be bothered to edit the quoted text to leave just enough for
context, and then reply. As someone to whom this is second nature, I think
having entire conversations included in an email is undesirable no matter
what direction it's going in. *shrug*

Over-quoting is also subjective, and depends upon the business 
environment you operate in... sometimes a full transcript is desirable, 
sometimes minimalist quoting is desirable.

There is also a third bullet for your list:  3) some people tend to have 
overly long signatures...

This is true with either policy. I've always assumed that point-by-point 
responses should be interspersed with the original text --so it doesn't 
matter what the default cursor and sig location is in those cases.  
(Assuming that the user has figured out how to use Pico...)

OK, everybody go back to work now :)

For some stupid reason, mail sends the LAST message first...I've 
encountered it before.

I hope you will permit a couple of questions from a novice.  I'm using v3.89.

1) Today I've seen a couple of things here about customizing pine.  One
made reference to "old-style-reply".  I took a look at my .pinerc and
searched on this but couldn't find it.  I added it anyway to my
"feature-list=", but it has no effect.  So how can I set pine so that my
reply to a message will start at the end of the quote of the message I am
replying to? 

2) I've just learned some vi, and had been wishing I could use it as
pine's editor instead of pico.  And in looking over the "old-growth" 
features list I found "enable-alternate-editor-cmd".  I added this to my
features list, and changed "editor=" to "editor=vi".  Now I have vi for
editing when I want it!  I just hit ^_ when in the body of the msg I am
editing.  My question is, is there a way to use vi to read a message?  Or
some pager like less or pg?  Too often I find myself needing to export a
long msg to my home directory so I can read it with less or vi's view
option.

What do you do for function keys, since VT100 doesn't officially support 
function keys?

old-style-reply has been deprecated in favor of the signature-at-bottom 
feature-list option.

Hello,
	I am using pine3.89 on an Esix SVR4 machine.  I have had a few 
complaints from some of my users that I need help with.

1.  At times the index does not display any information about the 
message.  It'll say something like, "No message text available."  Can 
someone help me with this?

2.  When messages are sent from pine the date is wrong.  It is something 
like back in 1970.  What would cause this?  How can I correct the 
problem?  The date is properly set on the machine and standard mail and 
elm seem to work fine.

3.  Esix is not running sendmail, so I am using a NetBSD 0.9 system as a 
mail server.  At times when users send mail it says, "Mail not sent. SMTP 
connection went away."  This doesn't happin a lot, and out LAN is fine.  
What could be the problem with this?

	Well, the only way to end this message is     HELP!!  

Thanks for any help.

Rick Gaine

I believe that this is the last "day" in the first call for votes on
whether to form the Usenet News newsgroup comp.mail.pine (to run in 
addition to the existing pine-info mailing list).  

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 13 May 1994.   

Full details have already been sent to this list. They are repeated below. 

--
                      LAST CALL FOR VOTES (of 2)
                    unmoderated group comp.mail.pine 

Newsgroups line:
comp.mail.pine          The PINE mail user agent.

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC May 13 1994

This CFV will be sent to the pine-info <pine-info@cac.washington.edu> and 
pine-announce <pine-announce@cac.washington.edu> mailing lists.

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  For voting
questions only contact peterb@lm.com.  For questions about the
proposed group contact Arnt Gulbrandsen <agulbra@nvg.unit.no>.

CHARTER

  This group is for discussion about use and development of the Pine
mail/news user agent developed by the University of Washington.  Any
Pine-related and Pine-specific discussion is acceptable, but general
discussion regarding e.g. MIME or incoming-mail filters is referred to
other, more appropriate newsgroups.
  The group is not moderated.  To be made moderated, the same procedure
should be followed as for the creation of a new group at that time.
  The group is bidirectionally gatewayed to the mailing list
pine-info@cac.washington.edu.

HOW TO VOTE

Send MAIL to:   vote@lm.com
Just Replying should work if you are not reading this on a mailing list.

Your mail message should contain one of the following statements:
      I vote YES on comp.mail.pine
      I vote NO on comp.mail.pine

You may also ABSTAIN in place of YES/NO - this will not affect the outcome.
Anything else may be rejected by the automatic vote counting program.  The
votetaker will respond to your received ballots with a personal acknowledge-
ment by mail - if you do not receive one within several days, try again.
It's your responsibility to make sure your vote is registered correctly.

Only one vote per person, no more than one vote per account.  Addresses and
votes of all voters will be published in the final voting results list.

This has occasionally happened to me. When I have looked in the mail 
folder directly PINE is telling the truth - there is nothing there!
All there is is a Berkeley style header saying that there is a message 
and where it came from, but everything else has vanished.

This effect only occurred after Saving a message; the copy in the 
destination folder being in this bad state.

After some correspondence, pine-bugs and I thought it might correlate 
with the fact that the system I use NFS mounts the volumes containing  my 
folders. A little while back they supplied me with a new version of IMAP 
as an experiment, and the effect has not occurred since.

Does the background match yours?

What is /usr/local/lib/pine.info?  The man page descibles it as "A 
pointer to the local system administrator" (or something to that effect) 
so I stuck my E-Mail address in there.  How and when is this file used?  
Is this what it is supposed to contain, or is it a biography file?  I 
have been unable to find any other sort of documention on it.

Christopher,

The contents of the pine.info file is inserted into the help text for the
main menu under the heading "Local Contacts".  Insert whatever local help
information you want in there. 

Thanks for the request!

Hi,

I just fetched and installed Pine 3.89 on a Sun IPC.  

I'm very impressed :)

But there's one little thing bugging me.  I'd like to have mail to local
users appear on the To/Cc/whatever lines with their full names listed.  The
default configuration tacks the local hostname onto the target username,
which I don't really want, as we hide all hostnames under one domain here.

I can do this by setting the user-domain line in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf
to be the local domain name.  I'd prefer for this to be added "silently" 
and for pine users here just to see the target id as typed, preferably with
a full username added in ()'s after they hit RETURN.

Is this possible?

Cheers,
Tim Chown (postie at Soton Univ. Elec & CS Dept, UK)

Hi folks.  A little while back I wrote some documentation for Pine.  I 
said that I'd get an HTML version and a straight text version up soon...

well.  I've finished (finally).  There are 2 versions.  one is a WWW 
version.  You can get it via:

  http://www.snre.umich.edu/pinedocs/pine.internet.intro.html

If you've got any url's in any home page that point to the old one, 
please change it.  I'm probably going to take the other one off line 
soon.

the other is a gopher document (straight text).  

  Name=An Introduction to Unix Pine (General, made for the Internet)
  Type=0
  Port=70
  Path=0/doc/pine.internet.txt
  Host=gopher.snre.umich.edu

	OR

  gopher://gopher.snre.umich.edu:70/00/doc/pine.internet.txt

Have fun.  Please contact me if you have any comments/questions/requests
about this document.

Reply-To: ag786@yfn.ysu.edu



>I wonder what they are ... probably can't display them with VT-100 telnet...

    The ISO-8859 standards are ways of representing languages other
than US-ASCII-based English, primarily European languages.  Asian
languages use a different set of standards.
    The most common subset of ISO8859 is that used by western
European languages, ISO-8859-1, and can be used for French, German,
Spanish, Swedish, and so on.
    All these subsets have in common that their first 128 characters
are equivalent to US-ASCII, and that the remaining 128 characters
(those with bit 8 set, or 8-bit characters) are used for additional
characters and diacritics, although the first 32 of them, just as
the first 32 ASCII characters, are control characters.
    Other ISO8859 subsets can be used to write eastern European
languages, or Greek, or Russian, or Hebrew, or Arabic...

    A true real-honest-to-goodness VT100 terminal does not have the
ability to display more than the ASCII characters.  However, many
terminal emulators which more-or-less follow the VT100 standard
have the ability to display additional 8-bit characters.  Telnet
itself will pass along this 8-bit data; for other connections, you
may have to make sure your configuration passes 8-bit data.
    If you're running a VT100 emulator on a PC or something, you
may see 8-bit data as funny Greek and other incorrect characters,
since the PC code page probably does not match ISO8859-1.  You can
probably translate the 8-bit characters to the correct ones, or
find a code page which has the correct characters in the correct
positions.  An example of this would be MS-Kermit; however, NCSA
telnet for the PC does not pass 8-bit data.

    If you are looking for code pages or fonts to view various of
the ISO8859 subsets, I set up the anonymous FTP server at ftp.vszbr.cz
with two directories under /pub:  PC-fonts and X11-fonts.  The first
contains lots of fun fonts, and under the latter, you can find a few
fonts for all the ISO8859 subsets except Hebrew (which should be
included in the standard X distribution), and Arabic.  Consult your
local system documentation for what to do with them...

    As Pine permits you to send mail using any of the ISO8859 subsets
and will pass along the 8-bit data it receives in MIME format, you
can use the fonts above to view practically any message sent with
one of these character sets.  Fonts for viewing other encodings,
such as Asian languages, could be found elsewhere, although there
is a Thai font on ftp.vszbr.cz, and more I've forgotten.

    Hope that's what you wanted to know and more...

Hi David,

About a month ago, we spoke briefly about PGP and pine.  One of your 
comments was --

> PGP support is requested quite frequently, but due to legal
> considerations we are very unlikely to distribute any explicit support for
> PGP.

In case you haven't already heard, there is a very exciting new 
development on this front.  PGP version 2.5 was released on or about May 
5, and the start of the documentation for that version reads:


Changes to PGP 2.5:

                 ***** MOST IMPORTANT *****

This version of PGP uses RSAREF 2.0, so it's legal in the U.S.!  The
RSAREF license forbids you to (among other things; see the license for
full details) "use the program to provide services to others for which
you are compensated in any manner", but that still covers a lot of
people.


> We are looking into the possibility of providing some general hooks 
> though... 

I'm all for general hooks, but since PGP is already so widely used and 
now that all legal barriers (in this country) have been removed, I'd like 
to encourage your group to reconsider including patches for PGP in your 
contrib/ directory.  You certainly don't have to distribute PGP -- just 
include some patches for those of us who use it.

Let me know what you think,
David.

I'm also all for PGP inclusion into pine, and while there is some 
concerns about the politics behind MIT-PGP and the fact that it is an 
as-of-yet untested encryption algoritm, I do believe that some ideas 
should be tossed around the Pine-makers about how to ultimately implement 
some kind of public key cryptography into pine.

NOTE:  MIT-PGP might be fine, but it was only released a short time ago, 
and it has not yet been fully tested among the cypherpunk community, and 
thus cannot be fully endorsed.

they are very definitely on our "short" list.

While I'm very interested in your team adding full support for PGP/etc in 
your code, would you consider including a PGP patch in your contrib/ 
directory?

Thanks,
David.

I am sure this question has been asked many times, but I haven't been 
able to locate it myself....when is the expected release date for 3.90 
(or approximate) and is there a "new feature list" available yet?

Can someone forward me a copy of the patch that was made to integrate PGP 
into pine?  I've grabbed the new version of PGP and I'd like to patch my 
current copy of pine and start using it...

The standard default with Pine is that if one starts another Pine session
then any previous instantiations of Pine are made read-only on the various
open mail boxes. 

I guess I find this annoying.  Any thoughs about changing the behaviour so
that the first instantiation does not have its mailboxes locked, and any 
additional instantiations get only read-only access?

And keyboard customization.  Any thoughts about having a keymap file so
that us poor people who use emacs for their editor for other things 
besides Pine can, for instance, change ^O to insert a new line, instead 
of postponing a message?  Yes, I realize that this will probably not work
for every terminal type out there, but for the vast majority of VT-100ish 
users this could have potential...

Corey,

Actually, Pine used to have the first instantiation keep the lock, but that
made it impossible for e.g. someone who left Pine running at work to update
their INBOX while dialed in from home.  If you don't want a second session to
steal the lock, start Pine with the "-o" command line option.  This will
cause Pine to open your INBOX read-only and not steal the lock.  Another
alternative is to convert to the Tenex folder format which allows
simultaneous read/write access.  This format is not recognized by other mail
tools though... 

We have absolutely no intention to support keyboard customization.  We feel
that the small gain for a few power-users is not worth the endless support
nightmare for those who accidently do something strange.  If you want a
customized keyboard in the composer, I suggest using the alternate-editor
feature... 

Thanks for the suggestions!

	Nobody responded from the first message I sent about having Pine 
sort the "to:" field when starting pine. I think this would be helpful 
for those of use who belong to 2 or 3 mailing lists. That way each list 
would be sorted in alpha order. 
	Or is there a way to send incoming mail to a specific folder? 
(ex: Pine Mailing list to "pine" folder; Emacs list to "emacs" folder etc??)

Sometime ago I wanted to use pine in a readonly mode and looked at the 
man page and didn't find an option to do it.   I don't believe that the 
-o option is documented in pine's man page (as at 3.89).

My suggestion: how about an option (call it -O ?) which has the effect of
-o if another session has the lock, but is r/w otherwise? 

That way, when (as I do) I start up pine, forgetting that another pine
session or other MUA already has access to the mailbox I will not screw up
the first one (ECSmail really gets its knickers in a twist if you do
this!), but otherwise I will get normal access. 

If I really DO want to grab the lock for my new session I can re-start
pine without the special option. (Maybe there could be a way of doing this
from within pine, but it's not that important.)

We have downloaded a binary of Pine from soils.agron.iastate.edu for 
SCO-Unix. However, when we run it we get a "core dumped" at the point 
after where the first screen comes up. We get the message "OPENING INBOX" 
and then the program crashes. I have a copy of the debug file and my 
pinerc file too, if anybody wants to take a look. Any help here will be 
much appreciated.

Unfortunately that is not the only thing missing from the Pine 3.89 man

I know there is an early port for Pine for SCO Unix (3.89), but there is
a bug or problem when using it with MMDF, has that been resolved and is 
Pine fully workable under MMDF SCO Unix or SCO ODT 3.0?

Thanks.

That shows

         -o             ReadOnly - Open first folder read-only
         
Is there any way of opening *subsequent* folders read-only? We have an 
archive of all messages to our hostmaster, and it would be very nice to be 
able to access it from a normal pine session in a read-only manner. I'd 
like to be able to mark folder collections in the .pinerc file as 
read-only.

The comments about read-only versions of Pine provoked this message from 
a non-Pine-using member of our staff. I thought it worth sharing...

'hmm. The thing I hate most of all about Pine and many other mailers is
that you can't go in for a quick trial (not even just to read the
otherwise inaccessible documentation!) without having it trample about
all over the place.  It's specially aggravating to have it touching
your inbox. If you are already deeply committed in some other mail
world and can't afford to risk screwing it up, there's real
disincentive ever to risk trying Pine.

One possibility would be an option to force everything (er, except
stdio!) to be openned read-only; another might be a "noclobber" option,
one that guarantees never to open for writing any file that had not
been created in the same session. Doubtless some deeper thought needed.

We are implementing a captive menu system and would like to use pine
and pico as the MUA and editor of choice.  Are you aware of any
security problems (i.e. ways of escape such as shell escapes etc.)
from either of these programs?

Secondly, would you have any references for us of people who are using
pine and pico in this fashion?

Thanks very much.

Yes!

We had a hard time with our students last October, on an untried system.

We had to hack pine to prevent the users setting up a personal printer 
command. We also had to set the global configuration so that any attempt to 
enter an "alternate editor" just ran a script that said "sorry, you can't 
use an alternate editor". 

I think our other problems were not specifically related to Pine, but to 
the Perl scripts that implement our menu system. (Don't, for example, let a 
user type a file name and then just obey Perl's "open" command on it 
without checking its contents. They don't take long to discover that typing 
names such as "|sh" give interesting effects...)

It would be nice if pine would respond to commands without waiting for the
inbox to open.  This is one of my main frustrations with pine.  It is
partly my fault.  I'm terribly messy and generally have a very large
inbox. (On one machine I have to keep it cleaned up a bit because I run
out of space and pine refuses to start and dumps core.  A nice reminder,
but perhaps a liitle extreme.)

I frequently want to get in to pine to do several things -- compose a
message, read a message in a folder, and then reduce the stuff in my inbox.
Even if I could get directly to the folder using a command line option it
would be a pain.  I like the nice general purpose command "pine" to get
into the program.

I think I see that there would be a programming problem to get behaviour
different than what you have now.  There is a need to wait to see that the
open returns with sucess.  But .....

Philip,
It's true that --unless you open with the -o flag-- Pine will update the
status of messages you actually look at (or delete!), but an original
design goal of Pine was that it would *not* steal your inbox and "hide" it
somewhere, like some other mailers do.  That continues to be the default
behavior of Pine, although a site administrator can link in the mbox
driver or configure for mail.txt (tenex format) and lose that
characteristic. 

The rationale was exactly that mentioned by your colleague: we wanted to
make sure people could try Pine and not regret it, or switch back and
forth among mailers easily.

Jim,

Do you get any response when ^K is pressed?  If not you may have 
something intercepting it before it gets to Pine.  Try "ESC ESC k" as a 
work-around...

I tried it and it works.  
  Works: 1) Mark text: ^^
         2) Select text: arrow keys
         3) ESC ESC k

  Does not work: 1) & 2) same as before
         3) ^K

I wouldn't be surprised if something is intercepting characters.  Here's my
setup:

Ungermann-Bass Telnet (TN100.EXE) on an IBM PS/2, PC-DOS 5.0, Windows 3.1
Unix Host: atc.boeing.com running Ultrix

We live in a diverse world in which not all mailers do MIME 
decoding/encoding--yet. This means that folks without Pine or Metamail or 
the like (say folks running DaVinci for example) are sometimes stuck in 
the following situation:
Someone using pine sends them mail with a MIME attachment.
They receive the message and are able to save the file.
BUT the file is now in MIME (base 64) encoding and can't be cracked.
Is there a MIME/deMIME program for PCs and/or Macs?
If the file were to be transfered to a host with Pine, could Pine be used 
to decode it (I think not easily)?
I can't believe that we're the only ones who have had this problem. What 
have others done?
Thanks for your help,
Paul

There's mpack/munpack.  Here's the text it inserts before the first
bodypart:

This is a MIME encoded message.  Decode it with "munpack"
or any other MIME reading software.  Mpack/munpack is available
in Volume 3 of comp.sources.reviewed or via anonymous FTP in
export.acs.cmu.edu:pub/mpack/

Version 1.3 was released just a few days ago, I saw an announcement on
comp.mail.mime.

Suggestion: set up an empty folder (in mail/ or wherever your folders 
are) and define it as your inbox; have your real inbox as a secondary 
incoming mail collection.
I do not believe that Pine will try to open the second one unless you try 
to Go there explicitly, or via TAB, or the folder list.

I get and send a lot of mail and have a large sent-mail folder. I want to
be able to open it read-only, mainly so that closing it near the end of the
month (when it can contain hundreds of messages) doesn't take so much time!
That is one of my main frustrations. I am often tempted to scan the folder
using an editor instead, simply to save time.

I notice (contrary to a statement in tech-notes) that there is no
support for MH format mailboxes (i.e. no initialization of the mhdriver
in pine.c or imapd.c).

Am I foolish in wanting this facility ?
My main problem is that the imapd daemon becomes a memory hog on
my 'normal' flat file folders, would it use less memory with MH folders
(or does it still need to read in the entire contents of each message
even to displaying the index of messages ?)

Brian,

The MH driver included in the Pine 3.89 distribution was a semi-functional
read-only contributed driver that we had no way to support.  However, the
latest IMAP toolkit (mail/imap-3.3.tar.Z on ftp.cac.washington.edu) included
a full, supported MH driver.  This driver will also be included in the
upcoming Pine 3.90 release.

Greets:

  I am running PINE 3.89 compiled on a Sun Sparc running 4.1.x and am 
awaiting release of 3.90 sometime soon so I can fix up all the little 
things I didn't change (compilation defualts) before announcing that we 
now have PINE available online for our users ... but I have one little 
question:

  I have created a folder which I call "for sale."  In it I keep, not 
surprisingly, items that are for sale.  Now, whenever I enter this 
folder, after a short interval PINE tells me that:
    "[Character '<space>' after 'for' not allowed in folder name]"
which is obviously false as I have no troubles whatsoever accessing this 
directory.  I was just curious as to why the functionality exists for 
this popup message.

Someone must have gone through this before...

Building pine 3.89 under AIX 3.2 (version is something prior to 3.2.4, 
exactly what it is is rather hard to tell) I experienced the following 
problems:

1. If built with IBM's "cc" it seg faults and core dumps whenever ordered
   to send a message (^X).

2. If built with GCC 2.5.8 it builds fine and will send mail, but gets
   badly confused about expanding paths.  For example, it can't find the
   sent-mail folder (even if it exists) and asks if I want to create
   a new one.  Then it chokes when creating it.  It creates it properly
   the first time, but for ever subsequent message it thinks the sent-mail
   folder doesn't exist, asks if you want to create it, and then
   complains that it exists and bails out of creating it, without
   sending the message.

 With debug level set to 7, it looks like this:

   === send called === 
  new win size -----<24 80>------
  cannonized To "Paul Southworth <pauls@isbe.state.il.us>"
  find_folders_in_context: mail/[]
  ====== context_mailbox: (mail/sent-mail)
  Want_to read: y (121)
  IMAP 10:17 5/21 mm_log ERROR: Can't create mailbox mail/sent-mail: 
  mailbox already exists

Corollary of this is that it's also confused about where the folders 
live.  For example, if you look in the Folder List it looks like this:

  INBOX	mail/.	mail/..	mail/saved-messages	mail/sent-mail

instead of:

  INBOX 	saved-messages	sent-mail

Consequently if I try to open the sent-mail directory it says:

  [No such file or directory: mail/mail/sent-mail]

Furthermore if I try to trick it into looking in the right place by 
defining:

  mail-directory=~/mail

It expands that wrong and says:

  Creating subdirectory "/u/pauls//u/pauls/mail" where pine will store
  its mail folders. 
  Error creating subdirectory "/u/pauls//u/pauls/mail" : No such file or 
  directory

Any solutions would be much appreciated.  Attachment to this is
a .pine-debug output from debug level 7.

Subject: Interfacing with MMDF and MH
Date: Sun, 22 May 94 18:56:20 +0100
From: Dale Peakall <dlp@Cs.Nott.AC.UK>

I want to run Pine on my site at University.  However, the sys admins
have no intention of suppoerting /usr/spool/mail as we run MMDF over
multiple machines which are all NFS mounted.

The default mailer we use is MH, and the system is set-up to put mail
files into individual files within sub-directories which act as MH
folders (in MH format).

I've looked at the source of the pine c-client library and have seen
MMDF drivers, and MH drivers.  I modified the makefile for the
c-client library to make it compile these files, and added the calls
to make_link in pine.c (just after the link to dummy) and compiled
pine as well:

make_link((DRIVER *)&mhdriver)
make_link((DRIVER *)&mmdfdriver)

However, this still doesn't allow me to access my MH mailbox with
pine.  Am I striving towards the impossible, or am I just going about
it completely the wrong way?

Dale Peakall.

Does anyone using PC-Pine have a gif viewer that they could recommend?  I
found one that works, but is only EGA and VGA compatible.  The others I
tried I couldn't get to work.  Any help using a image viewer with pine is
appreciated.

David

I'm using a product called Pathway from Wollongong.  I can toggle up to 
sessions on the terminal I have.  I am TCP/IP connected to our Sun 
workstation.  I had one session telneting to another account.  I toggle 
to my second session which was in pine and I saw the error message.  This 
is the first time that I have ever seen it.  I don't think I could 
duplicate it.  Would having the core dump help?

Gentlemen,

The most important question is "how can we reproduce this crash?"  If you
cannot determine the circumstances, we _might_ be able to extract that from
the core file.  If you know how to generate a stack trace (where command in
dbx/gdb), that is as good as the whole core file in most cases and saves net
bandwidth. 

Please followup to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.  Do _not_ send core files to
pine-info! 

Thanks for the reports!

David

I'm using a product called Pathway from Wollongong.  I can toggle up to 
sessions on the terminal I have.  I am TCP/IP connected to our Sun 
workstation.  I had one session telneting to another account.  I toggle 
to my second session which was in pine and I saw the error message.  This 
is the first time that I have ever seen it.  I don't think I could 
duplicate it.  Would having the core dump help?

Hi all,

  We just got a "Development System" for our SCO Unix box (System V/386 
Release 3.2 running on an ALTOS 5000). I am interested in building Pine 
from the sources available, but don't seem to be having much luck so far. 
What I have is a copy of pine.tar.Z downloaded from the pine directory at 
washington.edu. I then uncompressed that and untarred that. When i went 
to run "build sco" it stops after a while with an error message. Anyone 
have any idea why this happens? Do I need some more files from some other 
directories? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

There is a set of patches for Pine 3.89 available from
soils.agron.iastate.edu.  These have not yet been integrated into the Pine
distribution.

When using pico as the message composer, is there a way to shorten the
default line length from the 70 character limit to say 60 characters?  I'm
using Unix pine version 3.89. 

Thanks in advance...

I have some users here that are using pine and they would like to be
able to add a "Return-Receipt-To:" header line to their outbound 
mail.  Is there an easy way to do this from within Pine?

Please e-mail any reply direct, as I'm not on this list.

Thanks

I hope this question have a high priority, because sometimes I need to 
add header lines (such as x-anon-password), and I haven't found any way 
of doing this in "raw" pine (3.87)

Pine 3.90 will permit both of these additional headers.

Likewise, I often want to add a "Reply-To:" header, and haven't found a
way.  Could the "Rich Headers" be expanded to include this?  (Or maybe to
letting the user enter arbitrary headers?)

Hi, all,

	I was wondering if there was a way to mark a section of text and 
have it quoted (i.e. have ">"s placed at the first of every line) similar 
to the ctrl-j, justify and unjustify?

	Sincerely,

	Hussain

We are currently working on an FAQ and plan to post it with the Pine 3.90
release (some of the answers are 3.90-specific...)

Pine automatically detects a few Content-Types, including
application/postscript.  All other attachments are labelled
application/octet-stream.

>From the upcoming FAQ:

How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?

You have several options:

 1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to prompt
users to move read messages to a folder in their home directory upon exiting
Pine. 

 2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into the
user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your global pine.conf
(See the "tmail" program on ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.)

 3. "touch mail.TxT" in each home directory, which will cause Pine (upon
startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.TxT -- however,
mail.TxT will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley mail format folder
(faster, but non-standard). 

 4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will (upon
Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox, which will be a
Bky-format folder.

>From the upcoming FAQ (thanks for the question, Bruce):

When mail comes my way, xbiff lets me know about it, but pine doesn't know
about it. Is it possible to have a command which allows the user to do a
manual check in such cases?

There are currently two ways to force a new mail check. 

  o At the last message in a folder, press 'N' 4-5 times. 

  o Press `^L' (Refresh Display).

Yes, Pine has fuly integrated MIME support.  In many cases users do not even
realize they are using MIME...

This happens when there is an internal "From " header, but no message to 
go with it.  There are various reasons for this, most of them outside of 
Pine.

This may be a problem in the rfc822_date() function in c-client
(imap/non-ANSI/os_sv4.c) but we do not have any Esix systems available.  Can
anyone confirm/deny/fix this problem?

This happens when the SMTP connection goes away for some reason outside 
of Pine's control....

Sorting by "To:" is not yet implemented, but it is on the list.

Delivery to specific folders is currently outside the scope of Pine.  
Check out the filter, deliver, or procmail programs.  [Does anyone know 
of a good overview of filters and filtering?]

There are several known problems relating to allowable characters in folder
names and order of message presentation.  Some, but perhaps not all of these
will be addressed in Pine 3.90.

Paul,

Have you tried the pre-compiled AIX 3.2 binaries from ftp.cac.washington.edu
(mail/unix-bin directory)?  The IBM compiler on _some_ AIX systems has some
obscure problems and we do not have any experience with GCC on AIX...

The dummydriver is the catch-all, so all other drivers need to be linked
before it.  However, the MH driver in the pine 3.89 distribution is very
incomplete.  The current IMAP Toolkit (mail/imap.tar.Z on
ftp.cac.washington.edu) includes a complete MH driver.  The new driver will
be active by default in Pine 3.90 (due before summer).

I have been having great success attaching files to Pine and sending my
friends on Pine software, binaries, and sound. 
Question: Is it possible to attach a file to those not using Pine?
Thanks!

Hi
I would like to know if there is a version of PINE for IRIX workstations
and if it exists, where can I ftp it from?
Thank you.

Care to elaborate on what "fully integrated MIME support" means in this
case?  I know that Pine can seperate/display at least some types of
MIME enclosures (for example image/gif and maybe audio/basic) but was
wondering if "fully integrated MIME support" meant that recent versions
of Pine have the ability to handle more complex / less common types of
MIME enclosures.  

If so, does the user have the ability to tell Pine how to handle
different enclosure types (as with metamail and MIME extended mh?) 
or is Pine's MIME support limited to well-known types and display
behaviors set at compile time?

I've looked around a bit in the .pinerc file (Unix Pine) in which there was
a few lines that made me belive Pine can automagically sort incoming mail 
into a folder.  If I want to have all the mail coming from a particular 
person to be automatically placed in a folder, how would I do this?

	This ought to go into the FAQ that's being written.  I think the 
answer is you can't, but you can make vi your alternate editor and can 
manually switch to that each time you enter the composer.

Sorry, i dont realy understand, what you mean by 'set up aliases'.
To create or change aliases you have to go in the Main Menue ,
then choose 'A' for adress Book, then you can change or expand your
aliases.
If you want to change you aliases directly in the file, you have to edit 
the file .adressbook in you homedir.
Hope it may help you,

I was going to ask something similar. I presume that this means that the
MIME capabilities are built into pine, and it does not (can not?) use an
external MIME conversion program like "metamail", as the elm (is that a
bad word on this group? :-) mailer does.

: If so, does the user have the ability to tell Pine how to handle

Only a few types are supported. Once pipes are supported, (maybe they
are now, I am not running the most current version) you can pipe the
MIME messages to a MIME interpretor, such as metamail.

Mike,
As you suggest "fully integrated" and "complete" are two different things...

For handling more MIME types on incoming mail, in 3.90 you will see
mailcap support, which will allow activating external processors for types
Pine doesn't have internal support for. 

On our short list is dealing with the input file typing problem for
outgoing mail...  probably via something like Mosaic's mimetypes file.  We
have some concerns about the robustness of this strategy, but I personally
see little alternative. Can't promise this part will make into 3.90, but
we definitely consider it a high priority.

Using the DG/UX v5.4.2 and the SV4 build, all is fine with dates on

This is something WE would like to have possible as well, since WYSE 
terminals and the editing choices in pine don't get along as well as they 
could (^U, ^K for example)

I've used 'procmail' to do the automatic sorting, which appears to work
reasonably well modulo the absence of a user interface.

Last conversation I had with the pine folks suggested that they were 
looking to incorporate the similar sort of features (a la procmail or
elm filter or some such) into the system, and that the big headache was
putting together a user interface that was expressive enough to solve
the problems yet simple enough to use.

As an e.g. here is the Chameleon 'Mail rules' setup.  You get
a list of rules to add to; here's a representation of their
user interface


    Rule name:   ____________                > add <
    String to match: ________                > modify <
    ( ) Match case                           > delete <

    ( ) Delete

    Rules:                                   > activate <
       rule1
       rule2

To translate this into something familar for pine it might look
like a folder list or something.

All I did to get mail filtering was to install and take the filter
program from the elm mail system, and use that.  All my mail is
forwarded to the filter program, which places it into a particular
file depending on a file called "filter-rules".  These rules
are simple and easy to follow as well:

Example:

if (to contains "Cabletron") then save "~/mail/CABLETRON"

if (from contains "postmaster") then save "/dev/null"

Thats all there is to the rules files.  It was simple and really easy
to get working, so you might try that if you can't get anything else
working.

I get my mail by dialing into a unix host with my pc and running pine. I
love that pine can print mail to my pc printer, but most of the time I run
pine inside the iScreen windows manager, which stops this function from
working.

Anyone know of a workaround that'll let me send stuff to attached-to-ansi

Yes, that is exactly why we make Pine widely available and provide the

I don't have any clear ideas on this either, but I can certainly feel the
ever increasing weight.  Anyone who has been subscribed to pine-info for a
while can see the support load there, but the Pine Team handles even more
traffic directed to pine-bugs (2-3x higher than pine-info).  The total
traffic averages over 1050 messages/month (including requests, replies, and
some internal traffic).  This could get pushed significantly higher with the
addition of comp.mail.pine... 

Suggestions for reducing the support load would be greatly appreciated!

Is there a way in Pine to request a return receipt for a sent message?? I 
know some mail programs have this feature--it is pretty neat to know that 
your intended recipient has actually read your message instead of being 
left in the dark wondering if the message has been read.

Howdy.  After setting up my nice folders and aliases on this Unix
system and using Elm for months, I'd like to switch to Pine.  Is there
an automatic, or partially automatic, method of changing things over,
other than retyping/resaving/re-everything manually?  All help would
be appreciated.  Oh, if this in the faq, I apologize, but my system
just started with this newsgroup, and the faq hasn't yet shown up.  :)

Is there any address directory service that can be used with IMAP/pine?  It
would be very useful if the Mail Administrator can maintain a list of mail
users which is accessable by all the local users.

Please reply to my email address.  Thanks

Pine 3.90 will support multiple addressbooks, so one could be administered by
your Mail Administrator.  The more general directory service capability is a
function of the IMSP protocol being developed at CMU.  We expect to include
IMSP support in Pine 4.0.

Check your pine.conf file (wherever it was installed) and see if your

Well, as far as I know Pine 3.89 (the most recent version to my knowledge)
is said to be 'minimal MIME compliant'. This means that it only knows how
to handle the following content-types:
- text/plain; charset={US-ASCI,ISO-8859-*}
- message/
- multipart/mixed
- multipart/alternative
- application/

For further details consult RFC 1521.
More exotic content-types can be specified by using a /etc/mailcap (or
~/.mailcap) file on unix systems. The format of mailcap files is discussed
in RFC 1343 (a user agent configuration mechanism for multimedia mail format
information) by N. Borenstein. There are generally two methods for a Mail User
Agent (MUA) to support MIME:
1) Via an external programm, i.e. Metamail. This means that the MUA-software
   should be adapted to call such a program at the right moment. Many
   MUA's on unix systems have already been adapted to use Metamail. Metamail
   consults the mailcap files in order to call the right viewer.
2) Via an intern mechanism: Pine has it's own mechanism to support MIME. As
   far as I know Pine (3.89) can't consult mailcap files, yet, but I have
   had indications that mailcap support is under development.

IMHO, the mailcap principle is the best way to map MIME content-types to their
viewers. The syntax is very clear and unambiguous: using one syntax for
this purpose should improve the MIME standardization process.

Best wishes,
Rutger

I've always considered it a major omission that Unix does not enforce
the use of a limited character set for file names.  It should not have
been hard to implement early on.  There is probably only one (if not
just a few) place in the system where file names are created (file
creation, link, etc.).  It should not have been hard to do a scan on
the file name for "illegal" characters and bomb the system call.
Unfortunately, this was not done and there are now far too many funky
file names out there that would become inaccessible if the feature were
added now.  The reason I think the lack of this feature is such a bad
idea is that it creates problems with lots of commands.  File names
with spaces or shell metacharacters in them have to be quoted when used
as arguments on command lines, and many scripts do not do the necessary
quoting (for which I do not blame them since it's an excessively
bothersome thing to have to do) making many facilities unusable with
such files, not to mention that there are some scripts which bomb
completely or create garbage files when they come across these file
names.  Given that Pine was designed for the casual user who is not
expected to be mindful of such concerns, it makes sense that they
designed it to disallow file names which would cause such problems.

I forgot to clarify my situation.

I am aware of using the 'a' option for addressbook, and I know about changing the personal name in my pinerc. I wanted to know if it is possible to do the following:

I type in 'mac' when it asks me for an address..
pine then puts the address that I originally placed in some sort of file.

I know that it is possible because it happens at this account (my school account)..I put the name of anyone on campus, and it responds with an address when
I hit return.

anyone understand my situation.  thanks to everyone who already wrote, and thanks to anyone who can help me now.

It was done on purpose so the file system could support other
character sets, like Kanji.

In fact, the rules were liberalized over the years. Originally a lot
of unix systems wouldn't allow the 8th bit on in file name
characters. This was decided to be a botch and was fixed. There are
other examples.

Modern unix file systems only disallow / and NULL in file names
(sometimes you can slip a / thru tho that tends to be a problem.)

It's a feature not a bug.

Subject: .sig before Included text?!?!?!
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <smith.769987892@hepxvt.ps.uci.edu>

I use pine 3.89. I am sure that this might be a simple question, but
none the less I don't know the answer to it.

When I reply to a message in pine and select 'y' to 'Include original
message in Reply?' my .sig is included before the included text.
It is quite a pain moving my .sig down to the bottom of the page. 
How can I change the configuration of pine to have my .sig appended to
the end of the included text?

Subject: Printing long messages to PC printer
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <2s34u3$al6@news.bu.edu>

I like being able to print mail directly to my attached printer.
However, when the mail is more than one printed page long it 
often freezes after the first page.  This is a buffer overflow or
a failure to send a Form Feed, or something like that.  But it is
also a little more complicated in that when I issue a Form Feed
at the printer control panel I do get the next page, but it is 
garbled and includes text not in the message being printed.

Does anybody know what is going on and how to fix it?

I need some help here...
I know that you can forward mail by simply creating a file called
.forward, but is there an easy way to reject mail?  Like a file called
.reject?  (I know this doesn't work, but something similar)  I know you
can reject using Elm, but the process looks more complicated than I need,
in addition to the fact that I use Pine, not Elm.  Any pointers?

Easy enough...just add "signature-at-bottom" to the "feature-list="
section of your .pinerc file.

I'm not sure if what he said is it--I think what you need to do is look 
in your .pinerc file (in your home directory) and look at the feature 
list.  There should be one labeled 'old-style-reply', which you should 
set to 'yes'.

Hope it works!

I'm using version 3.89 of Pine for Unix, and I've come across a possible 
bug.  When using the blind (Bcc:) command, it appears to blind addresses 
SITE specific, as opposed to ADDRESS specific (with the exception of the 
syste it's running on (in this case, Netcom.)  If i was to be sending 
duplicate copies of mail to 2 people on Netcom, 2 people on GEnie, and 2 
people on CompuServe, the people on GEnie & Compuserve would see the 
other person on thier network that got the mail, but none of the other 
addresses.  The people on Netcom would see no other addresses.

Has anyone else run into this?  Is this a bug, or am I missing something 
not shown in the manual?

Subject: Pine Problems
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <2s38tu$n8s@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

There are about three problems I've been having with Pine/things I'd 
love to be able to get Pine to do...

(1)  (Category of MAJOR problem)  Is there any way to get Pine to take
all the messages in a folder and turn them into a text file IN ORDER 
BY DATE?  I _know_ how to locate and download the actual folders, and 
I _know_ how to sort a folder by date, but this sort only changes the 
order in which messages are displayed in the index, NOT the order in 
which they sit in the disk file.  

The inability to archive messages chronologically is the single most 
important reason why I have resisted switching all my email to an 
account that uses Pine.

(2)  (Category of mid-level annoyance)  Is there any way to either (a)
set automatic cc: to self or (b) set the folder so that outgoing 
messages appear in the INBOX?  I've tried changing the folder name to 
INBOX in the .pinerc file, but this just makes Pine try to create a 
second folder called INBOX and put my mail in it.

(3)  (Category of minor wierdness)  Why does a message which has been 
read revert to being unread when it is moved into a different folder? 
This has only happened since Pine here was upgraded to 3.89.

I'd be grateful if there were any solutions to any of these problems.

i recommend modifying your .pinerc file (you can even use vi to do this!)
the .pinerc file has a list of various parameters, with comments placed there
 by pine. scroll down until you see the sections pertaining to editors, and
then change it. simple. btw, in order to do this, you must have previously
executed the pine program. enjoy! :)

No, the mail transport agent (e.g sendmail) takes care of that.  The
user agent -- pine, for instance -- never knows about the copy that
was forwarded.

Mark,
See the file /mail/imap.software on ftp.cac.washington.edu

Two possibilities would be "Mailstrom" from Stanford and "Mail Drop" from 
Baylor.

You need to create a .signature file in your Unix home directory, which 
is a text file that will get automatically appended to your messages.  
Nettiquette requires that it be limited to 4 lines.

Greetings...

Perhaps this is a lame question, but how can l forward mail to multiple
people without it listing *everyone* l've sent it to?!?

I tried using a little command line prog but it wouldn't mail with an 
alias, and l can't change my chfn login name...

Is there some way to do this in pine or a short command line program that 
*would* work? I think mine wouldn't work because lt used 'mail' or 'mailx'
and lve read the online manuals yet lack lack the technical knowledge to
really know what to do!!

Thank!!

Almost everyone on our campus is using pine from one of the central mail

but does anyone have any suggestions on how to access it from pine?
Does pine support multiple address books?

Unfortunately the feature that will obviate the need of hitting ^_
is not available until 3.90.

Well... as far as I know.... You can't.  But, because I also have a hard

I read advice about using the elm filter to sort in-coming mail
into folders.

As someone who has never used elm, and whose computer system has
terrible documentation about elm and filter, I was wondering
if someone could post instructions on using the filter itself
and using it with pine.

Hi all.
Glad to see a newsgroup for pine :) .
I have a problem that i have encountered frequently in pine.  After i 
finish writing a letter and send it, sometimes, pine would say that
mail/sent-mail is NOT a valid folder and that FCC to sent-mail failed.
Now this would happen sometimes...probably most of the time.  Why is
this so and what can i do to fix it??
Thanks.

Yeah, that's one of the problems that I have with Pine.

You can do it one of 2 ways.  
1.  You can uuencode the file, and then use ^R to insert a text file.
	ie, "uuencode foo foo >foo.uue"  will make a file called 
	foo.uue.  Then, inside pine, you can read in the file as text.

2.  You can use plain old Mail.  The command while writing the body is:
	"~< ! uuencode foo foo
	It MUST be on a new line.

Of course, this all assumes that the recieving party knows how to 
uudecode a file (which is simple).

Does anyone know if there is a way (for v3.89) to change the From: field

replies, I want it to go do a different address.  I heard somewhere that 
this can be done through editing .pinerc, but I have yet to come across 
the exact line to add or change.  Any help would be appreciated, even if 
it's just saying it can't be done.  Thanks in advance

i use pine 3.87 and in .pinerc there is a section for features.
added <signature at bottom> to the feature line to take care of
issue you noted.
good luck

How about cutting and pasting to/from multiple buffers/files using pico?

There is a line in the pine configuration file (I forget what it is called)
that does just that.  I believe it is "enable_signature_at_bottom" or 
something like that.

Have you tried Mailstrom?  Its not a great IMAP client (if you have mail
folders set up in Pine, you have to recreate them manually in Mailstom),
but it's the only one I know of.  It's in the U-Michigan archives by
anonymous ftp at:
mac.archive.umich.edu
I believe it's in mac/util/comm

I have been using pine for the past six months. most of the things I learn
to do is by using the system, but there is more to it than that. I was
wondering if there was anything in print form that goes into detail about
pine. 

Thanks

To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <1994May27.044512.16214@newstand.syr.edu>


I've recently found while surfing (the net) for software a program that 
proposes to allow me to use Eudora-like fuctions on my Mac at home 
(pull-dowm menus, etc).  Apparently, I have to install this piece of beta 
software in my UNIX account at school, which I don't want to do blindly.  
The software claims it can be used by people like me who don't have 
access to TCP software on some accessible server.  

It'd be great to have a more Mac-like program on my UNIX-based 
modem-propelled system.  

Not knowing the name of this software (and unsure about how to download), 
I'm interested to know if

1) I am the only one in this position, of having to use PINE (which is 
OK) on a Mac (which means I'm all set up for menus and built-in commands)

2) whether using software that "translates" UNIX to my Mac is unusual, 
risky, etc.

Thanks for reading,

David Franke

and of course general distribution

If you set pine to use ~/Mail as maildirectory then folders work
as they should. You do this by editing in .pinerc

# Sub directory in users home directory where mail folders/files are kept
mail-directory=Mail

If You browse through the mailinglist archive you should be able
to find a script that translates elm aliases to pine aliases.

This looks a bit like the old GNU-emacs RMAIL problem, where innocent
but curios users suddenly have their email messages spread out in
several different and incompatible mailfiles. For GNU-emacs, there is
unrmail (use archie to look for unrmail.el if you want it) to take a
RMAIL file and build a UNIX Berkeley formated mail file. Is there some
program which takes a Tenex mail.TxT file and build a UNIX Berkeley
formated mail file?

This is maybe the most convenient way. Could you please make it easy
to select this in the Makefile?

I don't think so. I sometimes use NUPOP. If you request a return receipt, 
you actually receive two receipts. The first one tells you that it was 
delivered (this receipt comes back instantly). Then after the recipient 
has actually viewed the mail, you get a second receipt telling you the 
time that the message was read. I was looking for this feature in PINE.

Edit your .pinerc file in your home directory and change the default-fcc
parameter from :

      default-fcc=Sent-mail

to

      default-fcc=""

You won't keep any copy of sent mails

Yes, the mbxcvt program in the mail/ directory on the ftp.cac.washington.edu

This information is slightly obsolete; the correct name is once again mail.txt

Mail pulling is done *only* if mail.txt is empty or in correct format.

I have been a user of PINE for some time. A really nice program, put I 
have a problem I would like to discuss.

When using a 8bit character set such as ISO-8859/1, PINE transfers the 8bit 
characters into MIME qouted printable and adds the header:
Content-Transfer-Encoding: QOUTED-PRINTABLE.

In Europe most of the MTAs are capable of handling 8bit mail directly,
without the need for the UA to code it into 7bit. Not all UAs have MIME
capability and it would be nice if PINE as a UA could be configured to not
code 8bit messages leaving the problem to the MTAs (sendmail etc.) The
correct header would then be: Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8BIT

Is it possible to configure PINE so it does not code 8bit messages, or 
is this considered as an feature to come in any new versions?
The best functionality would be to implement a switch so it is possible 
to toggle between coding / not coding 8bit characters. Based on the 
knowledge of the receiver one could choose the best option.

Andy,

A useful alternative to using a .sig file at all is to define one (or
more) sig-type files and use <ctl>R to read the file into your document
wherever you wish.

I have found the use of the straight .sig file to be a problem.  When I am
replying directly to a local user I use all the information (including
work phone number).  However when responding to a less well identified
user or posting to a news group, I use a more abbreviated form (such as
you see here).  

This gives the option as well of having alternate signatures for more
'serious' E-mail, saving the more humorous for the appropriate communications.

    There is a difference between being able to blindly pass along 8-bit
data, and being smart enough to convert it to an appropriate 7-bit encoding.
This is what the ESMTP 8BITMIME in the MTA is for.  If you can talk to
a sendmail and it claims support of 8BITMIME, then it is okay to pass
8-bit data to it, otherwise, you have no guarantee it is okay.
    The way Pine might be able to do this is to be set up as an ESMTP
client, talking to a server, perhaps the same machine.  If Pine can
tell that the MTA will properly convert the mail when talking to an
"unsafe" sendmail -- i.e., supports 8BITMIME, then Pine could pass
along an 8-BIT or BINARY message.


>Is it possible to configure PINE so it does not code 8bit messages, or

    I have been told this feature will be provided in a later Pine.

    I also made the claim a few weeks ago in the pine-info mailing list
that BSD v8 Sendmail supported 8BITMIME among its ESMTP, but I was
wrong -- it does not.  I am aware of at least one 8BITMIME-aware MTA
in use on a system with Pine, the new Zmailer.  Note that, while a
sendmail may be configured to pass 8-bit data, that is not sufficient
for use of 8-BIT encoding -- it must be able to convert to an alternative
encoding when necessary, and the only mailers that can do that speak
ESMTP 8BITMIME.

    Actually, there are two answers to this question.

    Pine makes use of the MIME encoding for attachments.  This is an
encoding which is being widely adopted by different mailers, meaning
that Pine can speak the same language as other mail programs, and an
attachment created with Pine could very well be decoded by a different
mail program.

    Pine has MIME support built in.  There are other mail programs,
like Pegasus Mail for PC networks, which also have MIME awareness written
into them.  And many mailers have been modified to call an external
program, such as metamail, upon encountering a MIME message.

    If the recipient does not use Pine, it is possible that a mail
program which does understand MIME may be used, in which case, there
should be no problem handling attachments sent by Pine.

    If the recipient does not use a MIME-aware mailer, then the attachment
must be decoded manually.  This message referred to the UUENCODE program,
which requires that the recipient have access to UUDECODE, and there
may be problems with the characters used with a few mail relays.
Comparable to UUDECODE is the mpack program which will decode MIME
messages.  For information on mpack or metamail, see the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime .  With either of these, your recipient could decode
the attachments created with Pine.

    Whether your recipients could understand Pine's attachments directly
must be determined on a case-by-case basis, as it depends on what mail
programs they use.  But it is possible for certain non-Pine-users to
understand MIME messages without difficulty.

 Pine has built-in contextual help. I found when I type a "?" in the Folder 
Index or at the Main Menu, I got help with the commands available there. When
I did a ^G in the composer, I got more help on the composer commands. Try 
these things!

Subject: file locking problem

Message-Id: <1994May27.135941.2404@alw.nih.gov>

We've recently installed pine under HP-UX 9.01 in an environment where
all home directories are NFS mounted using the automount daemon, and
are experiencing problems with pine during the 'Sending mail' phase of
it's operation.  Specifically, pine hangs when the quoted message is
displayed on all "remote" hosts in an unrecoverable fashion.  When using
the host where the home directory actually is, pine works okay *until*
it has been hung up on a remote host.  After that, invoking a second
copy of pine will force the first copy to give up it's file locks, and
the mail will be sent and saved in 'sent-mail'.  Starting a second copy
does *not* free up pine on any remote hosts.  Has anyone else experienced
this problem, and is there a solution or workaround?  Otherwise, we're
stuck with the HP-supplied "elm"...

Hello and thanks for reading this post.  Is there a way that you can "upload"
a mailing list to pine so that you can maintain the mailing list on
another machine?  For example, I want to send a file to a bunch of people
but I would prefer to maintain the file and the mailing list on my pc.
What I would like to do is, when I want to mail the file to my friends, I wil
upload the file into the unix machine that I use for e-mail, along with
the list, and then do the mailing.  Afterwards, I would erase the both
off the unix machine and keep everything on my pc.

Thanks for anyhelp you can provide.

Subject: A basic FAQ about pc mail & unix picture viewers
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <2s4vic$2r4@crl.crl.com>

I have a basic question. To use PC-Pine is it a requirement that your
computer be part of a LAN, or have a POP, Slipp account? Or can you
uses it with a plain old dialup user account (provided neccesary software
is installed) what would this software be?  If it requires hardware, what
realitively inexpensive hardware device would you use?

Second faq: To really be able to use MIME at its fullest you need to be
on an X terminal correct? IOW, to view pictures that are mailed to you
you would need 1. X-terminal 2.viewing software  

Third faq: To save or download a MIME attactment do you just press e to
export the file and then uudecode the file?

Thanks for your help!

Within the next two months, the ISA Corp out of Canada will release ECS =
Mail 3.0 for 
Mac, Windows and X-Window.  This is a fully IMAP/MIME compatible mail =
package
and looks quite promissing.  I have tested version 2.x of this product
and am quite pleased with it.  

I have attached an older mail message about ECS Mail for WINDOWS.  All of =
the
contact information is listed there along with description of what ECS =
Mail is.

PS: Univ. of Texas at Dallas and Univ. of Arizona (I think, might be ASU)
have both purchased several hundred copies of these programs.
Univ. of North Texas will  also do the same if the version 3.0 product
is as good as they say it is.

sure, no prob.  just access the whole header (cntr-r when in the header)

Some Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) will add an "Apparently-To:" header on mail
that arrives for someone not listed in the To: or Cc: headers.  Pine will
suppress this header, but many other mail programs do not.  It partially
defeats the purpose of Bcc:, but the MTA's behavior is not under our
control...

Is this a bug? I have Pine 3.89 up and running. But,
whenever I change .pinerc as saved-msg-name-rule=last-folder-used
or as saved-msg-name-rule=by-recipient. Pine changes it
back to saved-msg-name-rule=by-from.

Is this a bug or the other alternatives are not implemented, yet?

Reply-To: ag786@yfn.ysu.edu



In a previous article, lmbutler@crl.com (Lawrence Butler) says:

>I have a basic question. To use PC-Pine is it a requirement that your
>computer be part of a LAN, or have a POP, Slipp account? Or can you
>uses it with a plain old dialup user account

    PC-Pine requires another machine to hold received mail, and a
machine to serve for sending mail along.  To talk to these machines,
PC-Pine uses IMAP or SMTP.  Therefore, PC-Pine must have either a
network connection directly, or speak over a SLIP or PPP link.
PC-Pine does not use POP, nor will it work over a regular dial-up
account that works for terminal emulators, unless this account also
can provide SLIP or PPP service.  There are several versions of
PC-Pine to allow you to use different packet drivers or different
networks.


>Second faq: To really be able to use MIME at its fullest you need to be
>on an X terminal correct? IOW, to view pictures that are mailed to you
>you would need 1. X-terminal 2.viewing software  

    An X terminal can make display of simultaneous windows more
convenient.  But you could also use PC-Pine, save a received image
as a file, and run a viewer on that file outside of Pine.  MIME
also permits mailing of sounds and formatted documents, and the only
thing you really need is the ability to display these; that is, you
need programs to view them, whether for X or a PC or whatever.


>Third faq: To save or download a MIME attactment do you just press e to
>export the file and then uudecode the file?

    MIME attachments are not UUENCODEd.  They use BASE64 encoding,
which is different from UUENCODE.  Pine has decoding built in.  When
you receive an attachment with MIME, Pine will list the attachments
and prompt you to <V>iew attachments, whereupon you will then be
given the option of <S>aving the attachment to a file, or if it can
be displayed (a text file, or if your display is capable of showing
images), you can <V>iew it.  Pine splits off the attachments and
saves them separately in files for you, and no further action is
needed on your part, other than to provide the name of the file in
which the attachment is to be saved.  Pine decodes the file, saving
a GIF image as a GIF binary file, for example.

Greetings....

I just found out that this group [which I voted
for] is now operational.


I would like to recommend the followings
for future pine upgrades/versions :

1) [this one I am sure can not be done
    in pine 3.8]

   Directory expansion.  To be able to
   expand a directory in FOLDER MENU as 
   as you select it into more mail-folders.



2) [this one I am not sure. It may be possible
    but I don't know it]

   Via commands 'g' [go-to-folder]  and 's' [save-to-folder]
   user should be able to give an alias, a nick-name if you
   will, rather than typing the folder's path.  I know
   some of you may suggest usage of unix's link facility
   but I think that will create a big mess for people
   [like me] who has a lot of folders in various places.


Thanks,
Farid

The problem is that there is no way to tell a priori what (if anything) you
will get back when the mail is delivered or read.  Some MTAs will send a
delivery reciept.  Some MUAs will send a read reciept.  But in many cases you
will get _nothing_, no matter what you request :(

I'm interested in setting up a mailing list -- or perhaps a listserv might
be a better term for it, since I'd like all the messages to the list to be
bounced to everyone on the list automatically.  Almost everyone I've spoken
to says they use elm for this.

Can pine be used efficiently for this kind of a mailing list?  If so, how?
I didn't notice anything like a "bounce" command.

Thanks!

Message-Id: <1994May27.161839.27960@sol.UVic.CA>

Hello all,

  Allright,  I will admit it I love Pine.  However despite this new
devotion to the mail/editor package I have one small pet peeve.
I would like that when I reply to a message and choose to include
the old message in the reply it ends up below my signature file.
I would like to change this so that the signature is the last
thing to come up.  Right now I manually delete it and then import
it at the end.  This is not a solution ... just a way to avoid 
the problem.

  Anyone able to help me out on this one?  

  Thanks in Advance

Subject: Editing with Pine/Pico
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <2s58vq$kn8@lastactionhero.rs.itd.umich.edu>

I often access my mail from home by using Telnet 2.6 (Macintosh) to a 
campus UNIX machine.  I run Pine 3.89 to access my campus IMAP server and 
get my mail.

My question is this:  I haven't been able to use the "mark" feature in 
the Pine email editor (and Pico file editor) on my Macintosh.  When I use 
non-Mac machines on campus, if I type ctrl-^ there is no problem.  When I 
try to do the same thing from my Mac at home, I get the character "6".

Any insights out there?  Sorry if this is a FAQ; my Usenet site just 
started receiving this group 3 days ago.

For UNIX pine 3.89, at least, the answer's given in the online help.
If you choose 'Help' from the main menu, then item 9 (under
'Configurable Features') tells you to add a line that says

feature-list=signature-at-bottom

to your .pinerc file.

Apparently Telnet 2.6 intercepts the ctrl-^ character :(

To work around this, try 'ESC ESC ^'

printing multiple tagged messages

Is there anyway to tag and then print multiple messages with one print 
command?  I can save tagged messages to a folder, but can't seem to print
either an entire folder or selected messages.  Any ideas?

I've heard of people configuring pine to automatically recieve a newsfeed 
for any given Usenet newsgroup. How can I do that, and do I need a 
specific version of pine installed to do so?

Subject: =20
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <2s5hfk$nm3@cville-srv.wam.umd.edu>

I use the PINE/PICO combination on UNIX for my mail. In about twenty 
percent of the messages I send, either as originals or as replies, my 
recipients get the three characters =20 at the end of each line [or at 
the beginning of the line beneath]. I notice that if a line does not go 
into word wrap -- i.e., does not extend to the right-hand margin -- the 
=20 does not appear.

In particular, all of my messages from wam.umd.edu to ucs.indiana.edu 
have the annoying =20 -- whether I am sending or replying to the 
VICTORIA-L listserv or to a private person.

Can someone help me with this problem?
Thanks.

While full hierarchy support (so that you can "open" a directory in your 
folder list) awaits IMAP4, it should be noted that you can already create 
folder collections which are in fact subdirectories of other folder 
collections.

The problem is more likely to be that it never gets generated. :( :(

The "KCHRs" are keyboard layout files which you can drop into the
System file and select from the Keyboard control panel (or Keyboards
menu, if you have one). Using the supplied keyboard layout file,
ctrl-shift-6 produces the "ctrl-^" that Pine/Pico recognize.

Cheers,
Andrew.

	Does there exist a rules program for pine?  i.e. automatically save 
male from John Doe in the Doe file, send automatic replies when a letter
contains a certain phrase, etc.

Pine 3.89 can be used as a news *reader* by setting the news-collections
variable in your .pinerc file and generating a .newsrc file with another
reader.  Pine 3.90 will allow posting and subscription management. 

Pico currently only supports a single file at a time.  There is a requested
enhancement on the list that would preserve the "cut" buffer across messages,
but that is not yet implemented.

I would suggest a judicious use of folder collections.  Then you can press ^N
or ^P to move between collections at the 'g' and 's' prompts.

You need Ethernet, SLIP, or PPP and an IMAP server.  A POP server is not 
required.

PC-Pine can invoke image viewers, but some viewers do not cooperate well with
PC-Pine.  The Windows version of Pine should ease this restriction somewhat. 

MIME does not use uuencode.  Pine will handle all of the necessary 
decoding when you View/Save the attachment.

The Elm users are probably using "filter" to manage the lists.  This program
works equally well with Pine.

Is anyone familiar with capturing email messages from pine using procomm
plus for windows? I am able to capture everything else successfully but on
pine all I get is the first and last line of text...and blank space in
between.  Any ideas? Or am i going about this in the wrong way?

If this message makes it beyond the confines of the University of 
Maryland at College Park, will someone please drop me an e-mail line to 
let me know you saw it.

When I send messages generated by PINE [with PICO as editor] to about 
twenty percent of my correspondents, the messages arrive with the three 
characters =20 at the close of each line, where word wrap happens. I 
don't experience this, if the whole line of text does not extend near to 
the right margin.

In particular, all of my messages, orginal and replies, from wam.umd.edu 
to ucs.indiana.edu come out this way, whether I am using a listserv 
[VICTORIA-L] or just e-mailing to a colleague.

Can someone help me with this problem?

Have you tried the on-line Unix manual for Pine on your system?  Try 
typing "man pine" at your system prompt, or ask your system manager.

Subject: Filtering mail with deliver.
Date: 27 May 1994 17:18:07 -0700
Message-Id: <2s62jv$3jm@wolf.CS.Arizona.EDU>

It looks like questions about how to sort incoming mail into separate
folders are going to be pretty common.  Currently there isn't a way in
pine itself, but you can use an auxillary program to work with pine
and get mail automatically sorted into different folders.  Here's one
way, using Chip Salzenberg's "deliver" program to do the sorting, on a
UNIX system using sendmail as the mail transport agent.

First of all you'll need to get deliver installed on your system, if
it's not already.  It's usually installed setuid root, so that will
take cooperation from your system administrator.  (Though the
installation notes say that you can install it in a personal directory
and do without root-setuidness.)  The source code to deliver is
available from any major ftp archive; use archie to find one near you.
Deliver should compile and run on most UNIX systems without any
problems.

Once deliver is installed, say in /usr/local/bin/deliver, then you
tell sendmail to pass all incoming mail through deliver by putting

"|/usr/local/bin/deliver your-username"

into your .forward file in your home directory.  (The quotes are
needed, and don't forget to add your user name as an argument or
sendmail may do unintuitive and unpopular things to your mail.)

Now what deliver does with your mail depends on the the rules inside a
file called .deliver in your home directory.  Here's (a shortened
version of) my .deliver file:

#!/bin/sh
user="$1"
TO=`header -f To -f CC $HEADER`

case "$TO" in
*clarissa*)	echo $user:mail/clarissa;;
esac

case "$TO" in
*usenet*) echo $user:mail/news; exit;;
esac

# Default case
echo $user

It's a Bourne shell script that looks at the 'To:' (or 'Cc:') line in
the header of the incoming mail message.  If the message came from the
Clarissa Explains it All mailing list, then the 'To:' line says

To: clarissa@tcp.com

and that matches the '*clarissa*' pattern in the first case statement.
So that message is put in my clarissa folder.  If the message came
from our Usenet software, then the 'To:' line says

To: usenet

and that matches the '*usenet*' pattern in the second case statement.
So that message goes to my news folder.

The last line in the .deliver file sends a copy of everything to my
inbox, so anything else besides the Clarissa or news mail goes to my
inbox as usual, and a copy of the Clarissa mail goes to my inbox too.
That way I can see everything in one place, and still have a copy put
in the right folder automatically.  (Since the news mail is usually
uninteresting I bypass the copy to my inbox with the 'exit' command at
the end of that case statement.)

Deliver can do much more but this should give you an idea of how it
can be used to sort incoming mail.  The .deliver file itself doesn't
have to be a Bourne shell script; anything that has the effect of
writing the user name or a file pathname to standard output would do.

Has there been any thought to changing some of the keystrokes in Pine to 
make them conform with standard Unix applications?  For example, "b" to 
display previous page rather than "-".

When in the Pine 3.89 Address Book mode, when creating a new "mailing 
list," is it possible to add the name of someone whose address already is
in the Address Book (as an individual) by just typing their nickname?  Or 
to add another group by typing its nickname?

If so, would someone please tell me how?  ;)

	Not to mention the fact that there is *no* standard for requesting
a "read receipt".  Therefore, even if your MUA supports such a feature
it is very doubtful that a different MUA will recognize the request and
respond.  (BTW, there is no standard for requesting a delivery receipt
either.)

Why not just S)ave the mail you want to a folder/file? 
If you just want a screen at a shot, cut it to the clipboard and then 
paste it to a text editing app. You probably could write an aspect script 
to do this if you do it a lot.
Procomm for Windows will not capture a Pine screen and if you check, you 
will see it doesn't appear in the scrollback buffer either.

Sorry, you are wrong.  It is only legal in a TINY percentage of the 
world, namely the US and Canada.  Export restrictions limit the 
availability of PGP's use outside these two countries.

In addition, RSAREF has a very anal license for using its algorithms.

In addition, version 2.6 HAS NOT been independently tested, has a very 
dubion background, and may be designed with hooks for the fed.  Until 
someone can analyze 2.6, it should not be accepted as secure as 2.3x, 
which, as I understand WAS designed outside the US and may therefore be 
legal regardless of what RSA says.  You'll note that there have been no 
suits and nor federal action regarding PGP, just a lot of threats.

There is some talk on the cypherpunks mailing list of someone outside 
North America releasing an International version that is compatible with 
the poorly designed 2.6, and yet will be legal worldwide.  The last name 
I heard (and this is preliminary) is that it would be called PGP 2.6eu or 
some such.

I'd recommend, at this time, that the PineLords wait until the dust 
settles on 2.6 and what other programs crop up before trying to integrate 
anything into pine.

In the meantime, methods for digitally signing your messages have been 
posted, and they can be done without any modification  to Pine.

(NOTE:  I am not a lawyer, and am most likely wrong)

Date: Fri, 27 May 1994 12:52:41 UT


Somebody on the pine-info mailing list recently asked about the
cause of strange dates on messages. Another person replied that
he had built pine on a similar OS and had not had the problem.

The problem is data-dependent, not OS-dependent.

There's a multi-page macro in one of the c-client files that
purports to parse rmail "From " lines.  The macro author made
some rather optimistic assumptions about the format of such
lines. As a result, the macro can easily fail, resulting in the
assignment of garbage to date fields, yielding a zero (0:00 UTC
Jan. 1, 1970) date. I think the guilty file is bezerk.h, but's
that's from memory (and I haven't looked at the source in many
months), so it may be elsewhere.

For example, if the From line has some quite legal but long
fields, as in
	From a.moderately.long.domain.name.somewhere.org!user.name Fri May 13 12:34:56 1994 remote from another.moderately.long.domain.name.or.uucp.node.name
the macro will fail miserably. See RFC976 for a detailed
discussion of what might appear in a modern "From " line.

One could extend the macro to handle longer fields correctly,
but it would still be possible for the macro to fail on "From "
lines with very long fields. If the macro is sufficiently
extended to handle likely input without error, any pretense of
efficiency of a macro (assuming that it would even be compiled
correctly by most compilers) over a reasonably-coded function is
just that--a pretense.

Rewriting the macro as a function, taking care to parse
correctly in the presence of long fields, will fix the problem.
The calling sequence has to be revised as well; the simplest
solution is probably to pass the addresses of the variables into
which the parsed fields should be stored.

Hi,

I just got a message today from a friend, the second part of which was a
list encoded in MIME format. I looked at it briefly using pine, thinking that
I would look at it again and print it out when I retrieved the message
with Eudora. So I did, but now the 2nd part is in I assume MIME format and
I can't read it! I thought maybe if I resent it to myself and then use 
Pine to read it everything would be fine, but NO! :(

Now I'm stuck with a message in cryptic language...does anyone have 
suggestions on how to remedy it?

Thanks in advance,
Norman

There are a couple ways to "capture" email messages from pine (download
them intact to a PC disk).  The most straightforward to describe is
to export the messages you want to save to files (the 'e' command)
and then download the files.  The more tricky to set up but perhaps
easier to use setup is to reconfigure the printer setup so that it does a
download instead.

Hi, Don't know if this applies directly to your case or not, but I used to
have an account (normal one during the school semester) and the default
editor was set to pico.  What a friend did -and I hope I can remember this
correctly- was to make a file called .kshrc with the line "export
EDITOR=emacs" (without the quotes). After saving the file, he typed 
". .kshrc" (again without the quotes) at the prompt, which I figure is one of
the Unix commands.  After that, everytime I logged into my account the
editor would be emacs automatically.  Maybe you could try substituting
emacs for vi.  Hope this is of some help.


Cheers! :-)

I've managed to set up my .pinerc file and get the software to
do what I want it to, but the bounce command doesn't work.
I have an enable bounce command in the file.  Is there some
trick to it?  Any help on this is appreciated.

And here is a guide for a few of the features of pine.

If you would like to subscribe to my mailing list and receive new guides and
updates send mail to calfeld@east.east-slc.edu.

This guide teaches Folder Management and Attachments for pine.  Although the
version used here is 3.89 there should be few differences for version close to
3.89.

Contents:
	Section 1 - Folder Management
		What is a folder?
		The INBOX
		Creating a folder.
		Deleting a folder.
		Renaming a folder.
		Shell manipulation of folders.
		Saving to folders.
	Section 2 - Attachments
		What is an attachment?
		The Attchmnt: field.
		Control-J
		Viewing/Saving attachments.
		Compatibility with other mail readers.

Section 1

What is a folder?

A folder is a file stored in your mail directory (Typically ~/mail) in which 
you can store messages you wish to save.
You can have as many folders as you wish as long is they do not fill up your 
disk space.  Pine creates some folders by itself:

sent-mail : this is a folder where the mail you send is saved by default (see 
Fcc: in advanced pine).

saved-messages : this is the default folder for you to save messages to.

sent-mail-<month>-<year> : every month pine asks you if you wish to copy your 
sent-mail folder to a folder called sent-mail-<month>-<year>.  This is to 
better organize the mail you send.


The INBOX

The INBOX is a special folder that is not in your ~/mail directory.  The 
INBOX is the file that the mail spooler appends incoming mail to.  It is
 normally /var/spool/mail/<login name>.


Creating a folder.

There are two major ways to create a folder.  
The first way is to go to the folder list (L) and type 'A'.  You are then
asked for a name of a folder and that folder is added.

The second way is to enter the name of a non-existing folder when it asks you 
where you wish to save the message when you do a save-message command.  It will
then ask you if you want to create the folder and merely by pressing 'y' you 
can cause the new folder to be created.


Deleting a folder.

To delete a folder go to the folder list (L), select the folder you wish to 
delete, and type 'D'.


Renaming a folder.

To rename a folder go to the folder list (L), select the folder you wish to rename and type 'R'.  It will then ask you for a new name for the folder.


Shell manipulation of folders.

Folders are only text files and as such can be manipulated by the shell.  
Here are some common operations and how to do them with the shell:

delete folder : rm -f ~/mail/<folder>
create folder : echo ""> ~/mail/<folder>
rename folder : mv ~/mail/<old folder> ~/mail/<new name>
merge folders : 
    cat ~/mail/<folder1> ~/mail/<folder2> (etc) > ~/mail/<merged folder>

These can be done from anywhere. By changing to the directory ~/mail you can 
skip the ~/mail/ section of the above commands.


Saving to folders.

While reading a message you can type 'S' to save the current message to a 
folder.  You can also do this at the folder index screen.

When you type 'S' it asks you what folder you wish to save the message to and 
provides a default (normally saved-messages).  Here you can either enter a 
name of a folder that exists and it will save the message to that folder and 
delete it from the current folder (remember the INBOX is a folder).  You can
also type in the name of a non-existent folder and it will offer to create 
that folder for you.  It is also posable to type Control-T and use the arrow 
keys to pick a folder to save it to.



Section 2

What is an attachment?

An attachment is a file or set of files that are added to the letter in such a
way that pine does not show there contents.  This is useful if you are sending
a file that makes no sense normally:

M%  ")'2 @J\4 +^/& "])P@ X ,     >/^])RP OZ^( *2O"@ $) < !20\
M<P,, X &- 0 0!0\ **O&8 $/'O& @P4A80D#  $) D !20\<P,, X &-(@
MKH\     $ #"K8@ KX\     $ #XC0     %   70 "D)QF !#Q[Q@(,.(6$

or a file that to use you would have to remove part of it if it were the 
message body (shar files for example).


The Attchmnt: field.

The attachment field contains a command separated list of files attached and a
comment string for each file, a number and a size for each file:

<number>. <path> (<size> <B/KB>) "<comment>"[,<next file>]

Ex:
1. /u/vi/calfeld/doc/guides/pine_intermediate (1 K) "Guide to pine"

However pine has a feature that makes this unnecessary.  It is the control-J 
command and is described next.


Control-J

By pressing Control-J while in the header have the option of adding an 
attachment.  When you type Control-J it will ask you for the path of the file
to attach. If you desire you can type Control-T and use a file interface to
choose a file.  After you have chosen a file to attach it will ask you for a 
comment.  You can just press return if here if you do not wish to include a 
comment.  After the comment is entered the line will appear in your Attchmnt:
field.


Viewing/Saving attachments.

When you receive a letter that contains attachments you will see at some point 
near the beginning of the letter something like this:

[Part 2, "Comment" Text 20 lines]
[Not Shown.  Use the "V" command to view or save this part]

and in the header:

Parts/attachments:
  1 Shown   3 lines  Text
  2   OK   20 lines  Text, "Comment"
--------------------------------------

To view an attachment use the 'v' command. This will ask you wish attachment
you wish to view or save.  #1 is the message itself.  Choose which one you 
wish to process and type its number.  It will now ask you if you wish
to view the attachment (v) or save it (s).  If you choose save it will
prompt you for a file to save the attachment as.  If you choose view it
will open the Viewer which allows you to view, save, search, and print the 
attachment.

Hello

When I use pine from my dial in modem, it acts a little weird.
For example the ^C doesn't work and various other control sequence
commands. Enough of them do work that I can send
mail but it takes twice as long as it would say I was at the
university.

I use the vt100 emulation.
I use the Unix verstion btw.

Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks

Fozia

Here is a tutorial to pine I wrote a while back:

This is a step-by-step tutorial for beginners in pine.
This does not cover many advanced or uncommon features or configuration.  I am
 currently writing "Intermediate Pine",  "Advanced Pine", and "Configuring 
Pine".

Please send all comments, requests for guides, or requests to get on my mailing
list to calfeld@east.east-slc.edu

This tutorial is based on version 3.89 with default set-up.
Part 1-Composing a message:

1)type 'pine' at your prompt to load pine.  If you have a non-shell interface 
do whatever is necessary to launch pine.

2)You are now at the main menu:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PINE 3.89   MAIN MENU                             Folder: INBOX  0 Messages

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "To:" field is who you want to send the message to.  For this tutorial put
your own login name in.  You will be sending a message to your self.

To      : calfeld

Pine should expand this to your full name (this is only done for people who are
on the same system as you are.)
 
To      : Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>


4) Leave the Cc: field blank.  If you were to put a address in here a copy of 
your letter would be sent to that address.

5) Leave Attchmnt: field blank as well.  This is used to attach files to a 
letter.

6) Enter a subject for your letter.  When you receive mail the mail will be 
listed with only the subject shown, you can then choose which letter you wish 
to read completely.

To      : Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>
Cc      :
Attchmnt:
Subject : Tutorial Letter

7) Now enter you message. (Pine uses the editor pico by default.  I have not 
included instructions on pico here but may in another paper)

----- Message Text -----
This is a test letter for the pine tutorial.

8) Type ^T to check the spelling of your message.

9) Type ^X to send the message.  Answer 'y' or just press return to:

Send message? [y] :

10) You should now be back at the main menu.  If you get a message that messes 
up your screen don't worry; just type ^L and all will be fine again. 

Now proceed to part 2.

Part 2-Reading a message.
1) Get to the main menu of pine.  If you are already here from part 1 quit by 
typing 'Q' and relaunch pine.

2) Type 'I' to enter the folder index:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a test letter for the pine tutorial.

4) You may now do many things with this letter.  You can delete (D) it if you 
have no more interest in it.  You can save it (S) if you would like to keep it.
You can export (E) it to a file.  You can reply (R) to it.  You can forward (F)
it to another person.  Or you can leave it in your inbox wasting precious disk 
space and forcing the computer to tell you that you have mail every time you 
log in.  

Two notes on replying.  On almost ALL posabilities you want to answer 'n' to a 
question of "Reply to all receipents?".  The "Include original message in 
Reply?" question if answered yes will copy the contents of the current letter 
to the letter you will be
 sending in return.

For this tutorial we will delete the message with the "D" command.

Last note: It is not a good idea to leave mail in the inbox.  Either delete it 
with 'D' or save it with 'S'.  It will ask you at some point if you wish to 
expunge deleted messages.  Answer 'y'.

Part 3-Adding an address to the address book.
1)Launch pine.

2)At the main menu press 'a'.

3)Press 'a' to add a address.

4)
New full name (last, first) :

Enter the last name and first name of the person that owns the address. This is
for your reference only.

New full name (last, first) : Alfeld, Chris

5)
Enter new nickname (one word and easy to remember) :

This is what you will type into the "To:" field to send a message to the 
address you are entering.

Enter new nickname (one word and easy to remember) : chris

6)
Enter new e-mail address :

Enter the e-mail address.

Enter new e-mail address : calfeld@east.east-slc.edu

7) If you did the one above you can now enter 'chris' into the 'To: ' field of 
any message and it will send the message to me.

8)If you wish to delete an entry: select the entry with the arrow keys or 'n' 
and 'p' and press 'd'.  If you wish to edit the entry either select it and 
press 'e' or you the arrow keys to select the part you wish to edit and press '
return'.

Part 4-Viewing old mail.
1)Enter pines main menu.

2)Press 'L' to enter the folder list:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PINE 3.89   FOLDER LIST                           Folder: INBOX  0 Messages

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)Select the folder you wish to view and press return. 

INBOX is the folder where new mail is.
sent-mail is where the messages you send are kept.
saved-messages is where messages you saved are kept.

3)You can now process the messages here just like those in the inbox.

The trick is that you need to wait for 3.90... 

When you try it, you should see a "Not Implmented Yet" message.
Unfortunately, there are several of those in 3.89, but they will
all be gone in 3.90

-teg

p.s. for those of you who are wondering when and what's in 3.90, we'll
try to post a summary in the next week or so.  It's progressing reasonably
well...

I know this is a dumb question, but it's driving me kinda nuts.

In the "Index", what does those "+" before a message mean?  I tried looking
in the on-line help -- probably not carefully enough.  BUt I'm getting
really curious.

Thanks!

I've just downloaded pine mailboxes to my mac and run eudora and it 
automatically creates the appropriate index file for it and they read 
just fine.  Try it out, certainly NO risk involved.

I know this doesn't directly answer your ? but it might help with what 
you want to do.

  Try another termnal emulator, if only to make sure that there lies your

  Kermit is a free terminal emulator that has a good VT100.

The actual rule is a little different. In messages that are encoded
quoted-printable, =20 appears whenever a line would otherwise end in a
space character. This is explicitly required by the specification for
quoted-printable encoding, and has to do with some mail gateways
stripping spaces at the end of lines. A quoted-printable encoder may
at its discretion encode all other spaces as =20 as well, although 
one would not expect a typical implementation to do so.

The only way to guarantee that quoted-printable encoding will not be
used is to stick to only the US ASCII character set, and to make sure
that no line of the message body exceeds 76 characters in length.
The only way that I know of within pine, that is; other,
non-MIME-aware mailers will not convert spaces to =20 under any
circumstances.

Question to the developers:
Will a means to force the use of a particular encoding for a given
message or message part be made available in a future release of pine?

I also found that certain communication program have overridden the control
sequence such that it activates the comm program's built-in features... also
with some MACintoshes, the MACintosh terminals remap the 'keys' ... so you
might want to look into that... basically, check for keymappings and key
functions.

Why is pine so bad in handling mail messages without the From: or Date:
headers?

Normal ucb mail seems to work fine with these - can't pine do a similar
job of extracting the date/sender from what's left?

I guess someone is going to say this is symptomatic of mixing ucbmail and
pine - well I like to use ucbmail occasionally over slow remote links. I 
think pine should peacefully coexist with other mailers...

And another thing - why does it append a full ip name (in my case
@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk) if the mail message is never leaving the local
system?

no '+' means its addressed to a group (e.g. a mailing list) or otherwise

Yes, in Pine 3.89. (Not sure about earlier versions).

See the preferences section of the .pinerc file in your home directory 
for the save message options.  You will want to edit it for the desired 
option.  You can use Pico to edit the file.

I would suggest not using a .sig file.  Save your signature from your text
editor with some appropriate name (I use two signatures, one for local and
known destinations that includes information on my place of work and a
second with just my name and general location - as I use here - for more
general and widespread postings).  You could also have a separate
signature for the more serious postings that would dispense with the less
serious parts of a signature.  I call my files SIG1 and SIG2 (lacking
imagination).  Do a <ctl>R to read the appropriate file where ever you
want it.

Let me know if this helps.

>From your index, with the cursor on the E-mail in question, select S to
save your message.  When the system responds with the request for the
name of the folder to which you wish to save it, give the name you wish
(you can call ir READ or whatever - I have a number of folders set up for
various types of messages).  If this is the first time you have tried to
save a message, you will get a message to the effect that this folder does
not exist and asking if you wish to create it.  Respond Y.  On any
subsequent savings to that folder, the system will not ask this.

If you go back to the main menu (M) and select F for folders, you will get
a listing of any that are automatically on the system and any you have
created.

Good luck!

Does Pine support auto reply? What I want to do is automatically send out 
pre-arranged material if a message comes in with a particular key word in 
the subject line or message body. I believe there is something that works 
this way out there, but I'm not smart enough to find it :).

Any help would be appreciated.

Message-Id: <2s8agg$gi5@nntp2.Stanford.EDU>

Hi all-

I was wonering if someone could help me out with printing problems.  At this
point, I cannot print from Pine.  I tried using "attached-to-ansi" and that 
did not work.  I figured out that I need to use the "mpr" command to print 
because that worked from my UNIX shell to print a document.  But, I tried 
editing the printing command (option 3? from the printing configuration
menu) and it would not print.  It froze.  Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
Chris

PS:  I am printing from a mac to a networked HP LaserJet IIIP, I think.

Date: Sat, 28 May 1994 20:17:58 GMT
Message-Id: <1994May28.201758.19643@umr.edu>

1) How does one run a shell command or spawn a shell in pico or pine?  It
seems that if it is possible to do either of these, the functions must be
undocumented to date.  On many occasions I have needed to run a shell from
within pico and have been very frustrated at not being able to. The same
would be true of pine if I were to use it on a regular basis, which I am
thinking about doing. 

2) Does the mime-encoding and decoding support uuencoding?  The tech notes
indicate that what pine does is similar to uuencoding, for attaching
binary files.  However, it doesn't say whether or not it actually will
uudecode or uuencode something. 

3) I tried out the nntp access using PC-PINE.  I am using PC-PINE 3.87.  
Is it possible to post messages to usenet using C(ompose) in the pine 
folder-reader?  Also, how do I get pine to recognize my kill file, so 
that I don't have to read through the garbage that I've already marked 
for weeding out?

4) No one on campus is running an IMAP server yet, so I don't know how 
this would work.  My PC has no user authentication or login, so it cannot 
transmit userid or password information to a remote server.  When pine 
attemtps to establish the IMAP connection, to read the NFS-mounted
user/spool/mail/$user mail file, will it ask for my userid and password 
on the {remote-host}?

5) Finally, if I leave the configuration setting so that the inbox is
called INBOX, as is the default, will pine know to go to the
/user/spool/mail/$user file for my mail and not to someplace like
$home/INBOX ? 

Thanks in advance for the info.

Date: 28 May 1994 15:35:37 -0600
Message-Id: <2s8df9$1vr@nyx10.cs.du.edu>

I'd like to see the imap protocol support evolve into something that would
allow us dial-in'ers to start the stdin/stdout imap server on our terminal
over the remote line, then have our local unix box or PC-Pine utilize the
imap protocol over the phone line, instead of limiting it to a tcp connection
(as the only means of using it). I think such would fly quickly, esp. in the
linux world.

Well, it would be great for anyone in the dialup situation who doesn't have
SLIP or some equivalent.

In the interim, is there a way for a user to attach the imapd to a user-able
port? This would accomplish the same purpose, but for a smaller usership.

OK.  Now I am confused.  Here I've been told Pine can not sort
mail and that you need to use filter (or deliever) or some other
programs I either do not have on this system, or do not understand.

Now, someone says, "Yep.  You can."

So...my question now becomes, "How do you edit the .pinerc file."




Thank you

try hitting the "s" key. that'll move your mail to the "save" folder

I've never had any problem with typing "s" which prompts "save message to 
folder [saved-messages]?"  it automatically created the folder 
[saved-messages], too.

Is there an expected release date for the Windows version?  This would add
very nicely to the client selection for our Windows users.  So far, in my
look at IMAP clients for various platforms, pine appears the most stable and
consistent.  Hummm...a Macintosh version?

Thanks again to the Pine Team.

I can put in 2c on that one. On another site, I run a listserv and people
subscribing to the listserv from the local machine (calvados) did not have
the fqdn added to their address. The listserv happily passed all the mail
upstream, including the stuff for the local people. The mail software at
the next site (bushwire) then added its fqdn to the mail from address, so
mail from calvados was getting a from address of bushwire. 

I got lots of bounces, the local people never got mail from the listserv.
After my ears stopped ringing, I fixed it in no time flat. Moral of the
story: for a quiet, effective life always use <user>@<fqdn> as an address.

Cheers
John

It would appear that this script has the tset stuff in it.  Remove it if

I use the tin newsreader and cannot figure out how to send an interesting 
news article to myself or to anyone else. I am also having difficulty 
printing an article to my printer. Although pine gives you an option to 
perform these tasks, I cannot seem to have good results.

Someone please answer the following questions:

To mail an article, I should enter___________?
To print an article, I should enter__________?
To forward an article, I should enter________?

Thank you.

In my knowledge, Pine has no option to automatically sort incoming
mail which is the job of the filtering programs like procmail, deliver
or filter.  What you mention are manual options to save once you read mail
through pine.

To the developers: If you are opting to provide any such features in
Pine, please consider making it a compile-time option.

Try in 'a' for addressbook and use the 'l' (I think) for 'list' and type
them in.  Can't remember if it shows them all or not but its an idea.

Thanks, Andrew...dropping the keyboard layout file into my System file did 
the trick.  For those out there in netland who need to know, the file

James--

To mail, press "m" then you'll be presented with several options.  You'll 
usually chose "a" to mail an article;

To print, press "|" (the pipe command), then choose what you want to 
print, then type "pcprint" as the device.  If you're terminal is set up 
properly it should print directly to your attached printer.

I'll have to check on forwarding an article...

I checked on the forwarding--when you mail an article, tin asks for the 
addressee, which can be you or anyone else.

BTW, the print function I described in my previous post works on Panix.  
Other systems might be different.

I was wondering how I approve a messge using pine?
I have set up a local group with myself as moderator and after
posting a test message it gets sent to me. I was wondering how I now
approve the messge and keep the original senders name etc intact?

Then, is there a way to set the right margin in PINE to limit the length 
of a line to, shall we say, 75 characters? TIA.

I had the chance having Pine not to crash but to generate a core which
helped in locating a major C compilation problem (some piece of code
which was not compiled by AIX's cc the same way other compilers do).
I did submit a rewritting of this piece of code so that it's a little
bit easier to grok for any C compiler, and it has (I think) been added
to the source tree.

Other similar C problems might subsist, but I did not run into them.

Date: 28 May 1994 21:35:40 -0400
Message-Id: <2s8rhc$f00@strauss.udel.edu>


I am using Unix pine, and our system has a spelling checker built in.  I like
using it, but I haven't been able to figure out any way to store words
(like my name or e-mail address) that appear in every message...so each
time I use the checker, I have to tell it to ignore each of these words.

Is there a way of creating a user word list which the pine spelling checker
will recognize, so that it doesn't flag those words as misspelled?  Thanks
a lot for any advice...Tom Rocek

Is there any possibility you have two saved-msg-name-rule lines in your

to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu and we will take a look at it....

That is a function of a delivery filter, which is currently outside the 
scope of Pine.  Some commonly used programs are filter, deliver, and 
procmail...

Subject: Warning: File Attachments in Pine are encrypted
Date: 29 May 1994 07:33:43 GMT
Message-Id: <2s9ggo$6mc@news1.digex.net>

This is a small screed and warning about the Pine mailer (version 3.89)
used here at Digital Express, and explains why some people were
complaining to that they could not read files I sent to them. I did want 
to warn people here about this (IMO *very bad*) behavior.  Followups
have been directed to comp.mail.pine so as not to clog up the general
newsgroup here at Digex with specific information about that application,

The Pine Mailer, if you use the 'Attchmnt: ' option to include a file on 
a message - as I do many times - instead of simply attaching an ASCII 
text file to the message (even when the file is in plain 7-bit ASCII and 
has no special characters) will "encrypt" the file using MIME Base64.  
Even if there is no binary material in the file and you did not ask for 
the file to be changed.  

It means if I mail a file to someone who can't support MIME I can't use
the attachment feature.  It means I can't mail something using attachments
unless I *know* they have a MIME compliant mailer. 

If this is a local change or caused by a set/setenv option, then it should
be changed back to set the default to not use Base64 under ordinary
circumstances.  If it is, as I suspect, a standard practice of the
program, it represents a serious, perhaps fatal mistake on the part of the
designers of the application. 

Technically Base64 is not an encryption but as far as I am concerned it
is, because it means people who do not have MIME based tools CANNOT read
files sent using the "Attachmnt: " request.  It means that for almost all
cases where you want to include a file in a message, one *must* use the ^R
function of the Pine Mailer's editor, and load the whole file into the
buffer instead of using the MIME capability to mark files with a
separator.  This defeats the automatic separator capability which Pine can
generate for individual, separate files. 

If you were trying to mail hundred-thousand byte files to people, as I do 
on a routine basis (I am releasing an update to Internet RFC 1394 and 
mailing people without FTP capability a copy of the file, which is 145K) 
this sort of behavior is *totally* unacceptable because you end up having 
to use system memory to load in a file which could simply have been file
copied into a spool file directly for mailing.

Encrypting files which are plain text when the user (like me) does not 
request it and where the encryption causes problems constitutes a 
*showstoppingly bad* feature as to effectively represent a defect in the 
program. 

To check that perhaps the file I was mailing had (unknown to me) some
hidden binary characters (values 0-31 or 128-255) and Pine was correctly
compressing the file into Base64 to allow transport, I created two small
files, consisting of simply "Line one" and "Line one/Line two of 2" (where
the / is a CR.)  It did, and when I checked (using "tail" to look 
directly at the last 100 lines of my mail spool file), sure enough, these 
7-bit Ascii files were now encrypted unreadable MIME Base64.  Pine won't 
even save this message directly, I have to use the View command to look 
at the message or to save it.  Other systems do send out unencrypted MIME 
with separators, so it is possible to *not* be doing this. 

This misfeature means if I mail a file to someone who can't support MIME I
cannot use the attachment feature.  It means I can not mail something using
attachments unless I know *beyond a shadow of a doubt* that they have a
MIME compliant mailer.  Since this may not be true, it makes the
attachment feature of the Pine Mailer effectively worthless. 

To me, this represents a major damaging attack upon the alleged claims 
that MIME would merely be an enhancement to RFC821 mail, in that if one's 
mailer was not MIME compatible, as long as you did not send binary files 
or use any special features, they would not have to upgrade.

Attaching a plain flat 7-bit-ASCII text file to a message does *not*, IMO 
constitute a special feature that requires that it be changed into a 
method that is incompatible with ALL mail systems that do not support MIME
Base64 decompression/decryption.

So this is to warn people that if you are not *absolutely certain* your 
correspondent's mailer is MIME compatible, to ONLY use the ^R read file 
feature unless and until this *showstoppingly bad* practice of Pine is 
changed to not make such a dredful mistake.

If you are running Unix locally, you can use "term" to redirect an IMAP 
connection.  To set an alternate port for IMAP, use the form 
{server:port}folder.

Lest we forget, there are two headers: one is 'Return-Recipt-To:' and

as such, the two do two different things, and one or both can be present.

I noticed that, too.  Pico correctly puts the signature at the bottom of

This is a function of the mailer on Compuserve and Genie (and MCI Mail

I got used to it on MCI Mail some three years ago when I first signed up 
for it; I consider it a "feature" rather than a "bug".  

This is something that the mailers on THEIR systems do, even if you use a 
script to pipe a dialog to sendmail, pine has no control over it.

You send the message using BCC: and that should - except where the system

sendmail.

It may work with tin, but it doesn't work with rn or trn. "m" marks an 
article as unread. Or am I missing something? Why is this discussion in 
pine? Are you reading newsgroups on pine somehow? (I have to quit, then 
load rn through the menu or go to shell to load trn.)

I don't know how to say this at the risk of considered as a flamer but...

People are confusing the job Pine should be doing.  It should be at best an
MUA and _not_ a filter for incoming mail or a list manager.  Efficient
programs like procmail or deliver are available as separate packages
for filtering incoming mail.  Likewise, there are mailing list managers
like Smartlist (previously packaged with procmail), listproc etc.
Ofcourse, you need root access for installing some packages, but then
you need to tell your root that you are running a mailing list anyway
(for courtesy sake).

IMO, Pine will be more beneficial if development proceeds towards features 
like saving (tagging) of messages, extra header support, full MIME support etc.

Sridhar.

Paul,
Welcome (I think :) to the Pine list/newsgroup, and congratulations on 
having the first and longest flame since the creation of the newsgroup!

Now let's talk about the issue...

In considering how to handle text attachments, we had a very clear choice
between: backwards compatibility for recipients who did not yet have MIME
compliant software, and the integrity of the attachments.  (Without some
encoding, attachments would certainly be corrupted by certain mail
gateways and/or mail delivery agents.  Even text attachments.)

In the end, the decision was made to favor integrity over backward 
compatibility.  We considered the following issues:

 o Pine is a very popular program.  We didn't want Pine to undermine
   the MIME standard by our using unsafe MIME practices.  MIME attachments
   need to be just as reliable as FTP, else users will not be able to
   depend on MIME.  This is just as true for text files as for binary,
   even though in many cases users might find the corruption of text
   files to be innocuous.

 o There is a workaround for non-MIME recipients, namely using ^R file
   inclusion, rather than attachments.  I agree that this is less 
   convenient, and for large messages less efficient... but we live in
   a world of compromises.  Note that there are also non-Pine 
   alternatives for sending files the way you want, such as the send 
   program that is part of the Metamail MIME package.

 o The problem is transient, until such time as most recipients have
   access to MIME-capable software.  All of the major mailer vendors
   have committed to MIME support, though they haven't all delivered
   yet.  And I think most service providers understand that they can't 
   honestly claim Internet mail compatibility without MIME support anymore.

 o It is common and uncontroversial for files to be uuencoded for
   Internet mail transmission, and then to be uudecoded outside of
   the recipient's mailer.  The equivalent functionality is widely
   available for MIME encoding as well.  (An example is John Myer's
   mpack/munpack program.)

The real goal should be to get everyone into the MIME game as quickly
as possible, so rather than trying to get Pine to move backwards and
risk undermining the effort because of corrupted attachments, how 'bout 
leaning on the sites that don't yet provide a way for their clients to
handle MIME?

I'll modify that question a little.......

Is there any way to atttach textfiles without using ^R and *not*
have them encoded?

It is possible to have a mail user agent do something like this when
deciding what Content-Transfer-Encoding to use for an attachment:

        if atachment looks vaguely like text then
            ask user if attachment should be treated as text
        endif
        if attachment is not text then
            use Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
        else
            /* attachment is text: it looks like text, and the user
             * has confirmed that it should be treated as text */
            if it would be safe to use 7bit C-T-E then
                use Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
            else if it would be safe to use 8bit C-T-E then
                use Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
            else
                /* fallback for text that can't use 7bit or 8bit C-T-E */
                use Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
            endif
        endif

The user would always have the option of forcing base64 encoding if
he thought that a message with another encoding would be damaged in
transit, but normal text attachments would be sent with the encoding
most friendly to non-MIME-capable recipients.

Thanks to you and everyone who sent me emails!  My problem stemmed from 
the fact that, when you type the nickname, that's all you see on your new 
list in your address book.  The full ID doesn't show until you actually 
use the list in the To: or cc: or bcc: positions.

I was just reading the thread on someone having problems with their .sig 
not being at the bottom.  I have another question along that line.  My 
.sig is at the bottom in everything I do, except forward a message.  I 
have the old-style , and .sig at bottom commands implemented.  Is that 
normal?  Do most people like their .sig at the top when forwardong a 
message?  Is there anyway to change that?  Thanks.

We share a DEC Alpha running OSF/1 with another agency which serves as
system administrator.  Sometime in the near future, we will have our own
separate system, so we have created an alias for our organization
library.ca.gov.  Anyone that addresses mail to us at library.ca.gov is
able to send mail to us.  That is also the user-domain that we have specified
in all our .pinerc files for each of our own users. 

However, the agency system administrator has configured sendmail so that
ALL external mail from the DEC Alpha has the agency's address as the 
domain; the entry in .pinerc is ignored.  He has informed me that he has 
been unable to find anyway to configure the system so that our outgoing 
messages will have our domain as library.ca.gov.  A system administrator 
at a nearby university says that he is sure there is a way, but doesn't 
deal with sendmail enough to know how to do it.

Any assistance would be appreciated - from confirming which information 
is correct, suggesting the appropriate manuals, or providing sample 
coding and where it should appear.

Versaterm Link which comes with Versaterm Pro can access mail from an 
IMAP server but it transfers the mail to your hard drive which sort of 
defeats the purpose of an IMAP client.  POP mail II does the exact same 
thing and is shareware.  Mailstrom leaves the mail at the IMAP server 
which seems like a better idea to me....but I have no idea where to get it.

You didn't say what terminal emulator you are using; complete information 
on your environment will help isolate the problem...

Both the Windoze "term" program and NCSA Telnet for the Macintosh (among 
MANY other emulators) will use the control keys to mean specific things.  
If you are using Windoze term, you should open the terminal settings menu 
and click off the check box that makes is use "Arrow, Alt, Ctrl keys for 
Widow functions" (it's on the bottom of the settings panel.)  If you are 
using NCSA Telnet open the special keys menu (I believe the command-S key 
will do this for you), then blank out the interrupt, suspend, and resume 
values (defaults are ^C, ^Q, and ^S).  That should help immensely...

As the online help mentions, just type a full pathname if you don't
want the file to end up in your home directory.  That is, if you type
foo then the document will be written to foo in your home directory,
but if you type say /tmp/foo then it will be written there instead.

Pine 3.89's .pinerc allows you to filter incoming mail to folders other 
than INBOX.

The .pinerc file for Pine 3.89 DOES allow you to 'specify 
incoming-folders other than INBOX that receive new messages'.  The 
keyword is 'incoming-folders' and the format is
incoming-folders=<hostname> <folder-path>

Dan, if you run Pine with the '-z' switch, it'll enable a ^Z to suspend,

Mike,
Pine's "incoming message folders" feature is intended to provide a 
convenient way of accessing multiple inboxes ONCE THEY EXIST, but 
Pine does not filter incoming messages itself.  

So you need to use a delivery filter program, e.g. "filter" or "deliver" 
or "procmail", to actually split the incoming stream into multiple 
folders, then you use the "incoming-folders=" variable in your .pinerc
to tell Pine about them.  (And the folders in that list don't even need to 
be on the same host.)

Wait for Pine 3.90 and then you can pipe the mail to some other
program that posts it, for instance: mail2news -a simon (ask archie
for the newsgate package).  On second thought, don't wait that long
but use another agent in the meantime to prevent a mutiny against you.

Edit your .pinerc file...
Look for the following line near the last 1/3 that says:

feature-list=

CHANGE to

feature-list= old-growth, signature-at-bottom

O.K.  I discovered the .pinerc file and is it long!  :)

Now I, and many others, some I know personally, have a couple 
of more questions.  We were all be very grateful for any help.
Please, post the answers here.

If the system wasn't broken, the whole commentary wouldn't have been 
needed.  Whether it's a "flame" or not is another issue.  The software 
acts in a way that is IMO defective for this purpose.  That it can be
used in other purposes is irrelevant, it's not much good as far as I 
am able to work with it.

Fine, but give *me* the ability to turn it off when either I know I don't 
need this capability or I can't use it.

Which it does *out of the box* by not allowing non-mime systems to read 
files it creates.

True.  But your program now makes them *non reliable*.

True, but when there is a possibility that I don't want it that way, let 
me decide if I want to not use Base64.

But then, there is no inter-file separator.

Nonetheless it would have been possible to do both: to provide reliable 
Base64 protection for most files, and allow people to override that 
protection when needed.  Additionally, they could identify a file 
directly.

Which may be years.  Beyond that, perhaps I want to create a file 
specifically for displaying *including* the separators; I can't do that.

The difference being the user's explicit uuencoding of a file.  Here, 
Pine is deciding on its own to encrypt my file.  For most users that 
might be acceptable, but I should be able to decide how my mail goes
out if I need to.

Of all the impudent statements!  'Lean on' someone else to change their 
system to work with a mailer that doesn't follow the standards!  That's a 
twist.  

The MIME standards are supposed to make the changes transparent to 
someone using non-MIME mail, which this doesn't.

Now, there is a simple fix to the problem to add the capability to 
identify files as text files that you don't want translated.

I figured out what to do; change the routine that reads the file name; 
since it doesn't allow < or [ in the name, those can be used to mark 
options for the file, e.g.

Attachmnt: 1. .pinerc[ascii] (2KB) ""

Would send the file ".pinerc" and force it to assume 7-bit ascii even if 
wrong.

Attachmnt: 1. rfc1394.zip[binary,type=application/zip] (45K) ""

Would tell the system to use base64 compression and set the header
type to application/zip to indicate a zip format file in the header.  
This would also allow people to mark files for a particular application, 
e.g. 

Attachmnt: 1.  BUTERFLY.BMP [binary, type=application/windows-bmp] (234K) ""

I would also like to know (since when was having your sig on the bottom as
"old style"??) I noticed this option on an earlier version of Pine's pinerc
(perhaps its on 2.89 I haven't checked) From reading USENET over the past
two years the vast majority of sigs are placed at the bottom. Personally
I like sig's on top on forwards...since it shows upfront who is forwarding
the message and there's no confusion on whose message is whose. But for 
everything else the sig stays on the bottom for me :). 

In Elm we had two sig options: one for local mail and a 2nd one for "outside"
mail. I liked this approach. Though the ^R option is a way of resolving
this issue I was wondering if such an automatic option for local and outside 
sigs would be included for a future version of Pine.

First of all, base64 is neither an encryption nor a compression
method, so please don't call it like that.  It is a transfer-encoding,
very simple, yet the most reliable there is for mailing files.  Pine's
documentation explains when and why base64 was chosen.  Even if you
haven't read the Technical Notes, you should've noticed what an
attachment is if you've used it that many times.

I would assume that attachments use even more system memory.

Minus the hype, you have a point here.  Perhaps a future Pine could
ask "Are you willing to risk some data corruption and attach the file
unencoded?"  Until then you might want to format your mass mailings
with elm or mailto which give you more control over the encoding.  Or
how about using the earlier versions of Pine?  (I'm sure Pine 2000
will have a configurable list of hosts known to be 8bit-clean, and
decode all the quoted-printables when filing messages).

It's called explicit lyrics.  After all, you never know if your
message won't be forwarded or filed some place outside.

Paul, 
Pine *does* follow the MIME standard.  The problem is with legacy 
mailers that do not yet.  Pine's attachment feature was not designed
to be used when sending to non-MIME-capable recipients, for the reasons 
outlined previously.

You are a sophisticated user focused on a very specific requirement
that is at odds with some of our requirements.  Sophisticated users
have many options...

Is there any way to make Pine add a '--' automatically when it reads in 
the .signature (as below)?

Pointing out an obvious mistake in the program is hardly what I consider a
flame.  MIME encryption should be an optional feature; to assume that every
receipient will have MIME-aware tools is a mistake, and Paul was right to
point that out.

Integrity isn't worth much if the recipient can't read it.  Pine may be a
popular program, but it isn't popular enough that we can automatically
assume that everyone we send email to will use it or even have it available
to them.  If/when MIME becomes a universal standard, it will be reasonable
to make it automatic and drop ASCII altogether.  Until then it makes a lot
more sense to allow file transmissions everyone else can read.

Sorry, The Pipe command in Pine 3.90 is for incoming messages only, not 
outgoing....

PC-Pine _can_ be used under windows, though not as a Windows/winsock app. 
There is a Windows compliant version of Pine coming some time this summer.

The "old-style-reply" option is deprecated in favor of the feature-list 
options.  Having the signature and reply above the quoted text was new to 
me when I started dealing with Pine, so I guess it is newer than the "at 
the bottom" way ;)

This has been proposed and will be considered for a future release of 
Pine (but not 3.90).

Pine will first attempt to use "rsh" pre-authentication using your 
username to make the connection.  If that fails, you will be prompted for 
a username/password the first time.  After that your username and 
password are cached for later connections.  There have been some 
proposals to make this a bit more flexible, but they are not yet 
implemented.

"filter/to-help" is an arbitrary path name relative to your home 
directory on the IMAP server.  It does not have any special meaning.

Again, these are arbitrary file names with no special significance.  I 
can see now that they were poorly chosen.  Apologies for the confusion!

Nope.  "news.u.washington.edu" is the name of the NNTP server.  This happens
to be the main NNTP server here at UW (access is restricted to the 
washington.edu domain, please do not try to use it from outside UW).

Make your .signature file be like
	--
	William McBrine
instead of just
	William McBrine

Now, if you are trying to use the same signature file for some other
program, say trn, that adds the -- automatically, you'll have to give
that up (use two different sig files).

You can get a double-dash manually to your .signature, but that is silly 
if you have other programs that automatically add the dashes.

Sounds like an important .pinerc option, IMHO.

Just edit your .pinerc and set 

signature-file=.pinesig

(or whatever name you want) and make .pinesig your ordinary .signature
with a '--' line at the top.

Please make sure it is "^-- $" as a regular expression, i.e. two
dashes and a space.   That is the convention for starting a signature.

Yes it DOES but it DOESN'T allow you to SORT incoming messages. What it DOES
allow you is to READ those sorted messages in separate incoming folders.

| Wait for Pine 3.90 and then you can pipe the mail to some other
| program that posts it, for instance: mail2news -a simon (ask archie

Though this is out of range of comp.mail.pine, I will point the
archive for moderator software to the original poster:
ftp.sterling.com: /moderators/

You should find a file (that I contributed) to use procmail for 
moderation tasks. All you need to do after writing up a procmail script 
is "inews -h < <file>".  I have included some documentation in it.

If Pine allows piping a message to a script, that would be a pretty
useful addition for lots of things including moderation.

: Baloney - It is not an obvious mistake. Maybe you want an enhancement 
but the pine group has graciously supplied us with a nice mail program at 
no charge and doesn't deserve this kind of flak. The pine group has 
clearly stated their objectives and criteria for development and have
delivered a good product meeting those objectives. The pine group is 
flexible and has modified their criteria over the last nine months that I 
have subscribed to the list, as a result of user requests. You may 
disagree with their objectives but if your request doesn't fit into the 
pine charter then build your own program instead of flameing the pine 
development team! I don't believe that the pine development team is in 
business to customize pine for every user for free.

: Ditto the above comment. One can always use ^R if you want ASCII. The 
susprise to me was that uuencode has integrity problems but that being the 
case, I see no reason why pine should not make the break and make the 
default MIME. I gather that the pine team is open to considering 
enhancements that allow one to send attachments using methods other than 
pine but, if I understand the pine charter correctly, every enhancement 
pushes the pine mailer further from the stated objective of keeping the 
program simple for the new or novice user. Give the pine team some 
credit. I think they have done a good job balancing requirements and 
"power" user wishes and from the mail messages I see posted thay are 
certainly open to suggestions.

Assuming that every recipient will have a particular format at their 
disposal is an obvious mistake.  Most non-Pine users I know don't have 
MIME-aware tools and it is silly to pretend that they do.

If they didn't want "flak" they need not have established this list or 
pine-bugs.  That they did implies that they are interested in knowing 
what aspects can stand improvement.

No one objects to making MIME the default.  It's the fact that the user 
cannot override it without loading the file into the editor which is 
annoying.  Adding an override option to be specified in .pinerc would not 
interfere with this objective at all.

See above.  The novice user need not know the override option is 
available, while the power user would specifically enable it.  To anyone 
who doesn't Pine would function exactly the way it does now.  Hardly 
grounds for saying "write your own program" rather than fixing what's broke.

Like labeling as "flames" any specific criticisms?  Somehow that doesn't 
strike me as particularly "open."

Does anyone have a flat ASCII version of the man pages for PINE and PICO?

Our attempts at de-roffing them has not met with as much sucess as desired.

Jeff,
My opening comment to Paul R. was meant humorously in the spirit of his
own signature lines about being voted "Largest polluter... " I had thought
one smiley in my sentence was sufficient, but I misjudged.  Sorry about
that. 

As to Base64 encoding of all attachments being "an obvious mistake in the
program", we disagree.  MIME mailers should be able to deliver attachments
with the same robustness as FTP.  This goal is best achieved with Base64.

If you'd like to propose a new MIME type that explicitly conveys the
intent that file integrity (and therefore C-T-E) doesn't matter, e.g. 
TEXT/APPROXIMATION, then we would have some common ground... but helping
recipients get MIME-capable s/w --which they are going to need for other 
things anyway-- seems like a better place to invest effort.

That'd be fine, as long as it doesn't assume anything about the 
recipient's tools.  Many, probably most file transmissions are text-based 
and an approximation would be fine.

No argument there - I'd be the last to argue that MIME capability should 
be dropped or even relegated to non-default status.  This is why I 
suggested ASCII override as an option to be set in pine.conf or .pinerc, 
neither of which is likely to be tampered with by a novice user anyway.

BTW - any particular reason why Pine doesn't allow a separate "Reply-to:" 
field?  That too could be incorporated without confusing the newbies, 
either by adding it to the .pinerc options or by telling Pine to use the 
environmental variable REPLYTO.

I know some will say "if you want that use Elm" but it seems like a few 
such changes to Pine would render Elm wholly redundant.

Pine 3.90 will support customized headers, including Reply-To:

We're hoping to have a beta version available by the end of June
(that's "late spring" to us in Seattle :)

Very impressive! But I have a couple of questions:
1) When will Pine 3.90 available for the masses?
2) Will Pine support Metamail && || mailcap files?
3) Does Pine also include MIME support in the news-reader functionality?
4) Did Yehavi's VMS-port of Pine make it into 3.90 and again what about
   questions 2 and 3?

Thanks in advance.

    Hello,
I am using Pine 3.89 on a vax system.  I sent a short test message with 
a signature file to myself and recieved exactly what I sent.  BUT, when
I sent a similar message to a local user on the system, she recieved what 
is below.  Is this a "system" problem, or do I just have something screwy
set-up in my .pinerc file?   Thanks for any help you can give.

That doesn't matter as long as it can pipe the entire message
including the header.  Submitted articles show up as incoming messages
for the moderator.  Simon wanted to approve submissions from within
Pine.  As I said, he will need a separate tool to reformat the header
and publish it, and then he can use the pipe function.

Hmmm.  Just captured this message and scrolled back to the original 
message using Procomm for Windows.  I have no idea why this wouldn't work

I like to compress (with gzip) my folders to save space. I was wondering
if Pine will be able (or is able) to save and read articles in compressed 
folders? If not I think it would be a handy additional utility for Pine.

I used the "attachment" function for txt files when I was new at PINE.  
It seemed to make sense.

Unfortunately, I did not know that MIME would be used, and neither did my 
correspondents.  I got upset messages back, saying things like "please 
don't encode the attachments".  So now I use ^R, and everyone is pleased.

If MIME is to be the future standard, how do we all learn to use it?

One posting mentions the documentation for PINE, which certainly ought to 
include a discussion of MIME.  How can I get the documentation?

No, but what you can do is set the SPELL environmental variable to a spell 
checker (i.e. ispell) that uses user word lists.

Although there have been responses, to the question of sorting
in-coming mail, none of them have really answered my own question.

How do you use filter and pine, together, to sort in-coming mail?

I, and others, would really be grateful for some help.   :)

	When I paste some text in Pine  (it is set with defaults except
that I have the .sig at bottom enabled) my sig is embedded in the first 
couple of lines of the text and the text is formatted incorrectly.  I
don't have a problem with anything else.  Any ideas what is wrong?
Thanks!

I'd appreciate hearing about the availability of a user's guide for pine.
We've been using it here for a few weeks and some relatively
inexperienced users would liek to have a user's guide.

How do I enable the suspension feature in Pine.  Previously when using

telling me that suspension is not enabled & I should look in the help

Any help would be appreciatedl

	What you see below is your .sig that has been encoded using
base64 encoding.

	Correct me if I am wrong but you used ^R to read in your .sig.

	Well, what happened is pine detected 8bit data in your message
when you sent it.  Thus it decided, correctly, that it should be encoded
to ensure that it arrives at the destination intact.  It was sent the
same way when you sent it to yourself and to the other person.  The
only difference is you are using a MIME capable UA and the other person
is not.  When you read your message with pine it automatically decoded
the base64 and displayed your .sig.  If you look in your mail spool
file you will see the same encoded data and not your .sig.

	Run Pine with the '-z' option (ie. "pine -z").  This enables it.

Pine 3.90 will include mailcap support derived from Metamail 2.6.  Most, but
not all, types are supported.

Yes.

Yehavi's VMS port has not yet been incorporated :(

The major internal restructuring that has been taking place has made it very
difficult to incorporate new ports in parallel with those changes.  If Pine
3.90 is otherwise stable, I would expect a maintenance release just to
incorporate fixes to ports we do not handle directly...

There is not currently a compressed folder driver for Pine, but it should 
be a nice weekend project for a reasonably proficient programmer...  

A conpressed folder driver is frequently requested, but so far not by our
primary constituency, so it is not currently high on our priority list.  We
would be happy to include a contributed driver though...

and thus don't build pine (It does build pico, but nothing else)

	I believe the current version of Pine is 3.89. When will
the next version (4.XX ???) be released? 

	Another question: Is there a way to tag messages so that
e.g. saving multiple messages to a folder would be easier? Elm
handles this very elegantly.

I would like to suggest that when someone is responding with advice to 
give correspondents on this (or any other list), where a modification is 
to be made on a file, that you specify

the filename (and directory if it is not in the users root directory)

the exact syntax of the command or modification to be made, ideally with 
the old line(s) and then the new line(s).

This will help teach users what the effects of the modifications were, 
and should enable them to feel confident about what they are doing.  
Then, hopefully, there won't be angst and screwups to files that were not 
intended.

Subject: Easy way to read WP file into Pine msg?
Date: 30 May 1994 10:33:05 -0700
Message-Id: <2sd80h$q3b@crl.crl.com>

Is there an easy way to read word-processing files into pine mail?  I go 
through a multi-step process (outlined below).  Even doing this, for some 
reason I often lose the last line or so of the file.  This is what I do:
1.  Save the wp51 file as ascii text.
2.  Upload to server.
3.  Convert to unix, using "dos2unix (filename) > (new filename)".  This 
is necessary in order to get rid of ^M's.
4. Using ^R, I read the file into the message portion of letter.

Even after all this, I seem to lose the last line or two, often, of the 
file.  Yet if I "more" or "less" the uploaded file, it is complete.  I 
get a message like "funny line at EOF" on pine.  What does that mean?
Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

I thought I read here a week or so ago that 3.90 was released already,
and that was the newest version.  Course, I could be wrong....

Remove the ^Z that is appearing at the end of the file. It should be on a
line by itself.

If you've gotten this far, you obviouly know whatr the problem is. I'm printing to a canon BJC-600 From a pc. I'm using procomm plus for Windows as my comm prog.
Any suggegtions? If I use the second choice, I believe that the printing goes to my default printer. Which is not where I am when I want to print.

If there are any fixes, or solutions I would be glad to hear of them.

Thanks in advance,

Jonathan Butt

I just found this out recently: create a .forward file with the following 
line:

<username@newuser.site>

And assign world-read privilges to it.

Bingo.

This problem exists when compiling under SVR4 environment on a MIPS running
RISC/os 5.01. The fix is to edit the rfc822_date() function so that
the call to tzset() is done *before* the call to localtime(). On RISC/os 5.01,
tzset() apparently clears the structure returned from localtime().

ie :

void rfc822_date (date)
        char *date;
{
  int zone,dstnow;
  struct tm *t;
  time_t time_sec = time (0);

  /*************************************
  The following 2 lines must be swapped:
  t = localtime (&time_sec);    /* convert to individual items */
  tzset ();                     /* initialize timezone/daylight variables */
  ***************************************/
  tzset ();                     /* initialize timezone/daylight variables */
  t = localtime (&time_sec);    /* convert to individual items */

                                /* see if it is DST now */
  dstnow = daylight && t->tm_isdst;
                                /* get timezone value */
  zone = - (dstnow ? altzone : timezone) / 60;
                                /* and output it */
  sprintf (date,"%s, %d %s %d %02d:%02d:%02d %+03d%02d (%s)",
           days[t->tm_wday],t->tm_mday,months[t->tm_mon],t->tm_year+1900,
           t->tm_hour,t->tm_min,t->tm_sec,zone/60,abs (zone) % 60,
           tzname[dstnow]);
}

Hello everyone,

	Is there anybody who has ever used PC-PINE packet driver version with
a SLIP packet driver , such as SLIPPER, UMSLIP,etc ?

	I run PC-PINE with SLIPPER, and it simply hangs on 'opening INBOX...'
screen. Am I doing anything wrong ?

Simply add "enable-suspend" in feature-list variable in .pinerc file,
located in your homedirectory. So, change that line to look like:

feature-list=enable-suspend

As you can see, that file is really nicely documented and you can
probably find many other neat features in there.

Hopefully this helps..

Message-Id: <2sejn5$jah@harbinger.cc.monash.edu.au>


	I have a question about the personal-name option in Pine v3.07.
I have changed the personal-name field in my .pinerc
(personal-name=Highlander) and it works fine when sending mail. However,
when looking through my sent-mail folder it reports the mail as having
been sent to my personal-name rather than who the mail was actually sent
to. Our uni network consists of 69 networked decstations
(@mdw###.cc.monash....) We do not login to the same decstation every
time. When I login to the same mdw as the mdw I was on when I sent the
mail, the sent-mail folder works fine, however, when I am on a different
mdw, all mail in the sent-mail folder reports being sent to my
personal-name. 

e.g. If I login to mdw081 and send mail to Fred...then in the sent-mail
folder it says

100 May 31 To:Fred	(size) subject

when I am still logged into mdw081

If I login to say mdw012 the sent-mail folder will say

100 May 31 Highlander	(size) subject

Anytime I log back into mdw081 all mail sent from there is fine, but
from any other mdw it gives the above message. Is there any way I can
ensure the sent-mail folder will report who the mail is actually sent to
rather than displaying my personal-name? 

Thanks for your help. (I hope I made sense)

	I've used PC-PINE over SLIP using FTP Software's PC/TCP.  I've
had no problems.

	I don't know much about your configuration so it is hard to say
what may be wrong.  I did have some problems with configuration of the
PC/TCP to work properly with the serial port on the PC....since I only
have a 8550(?) UART.

	Maybe one of our folks here at the office can help.  You can send
mail to Frank.Hsu@twntpe.cdc.com.  We are very "close" to you.

i have a question:
my friend was trying to talk to me from her computer and she signalled me 
to talk but all i could see was a whole bunch of binary figures keeping 
on moving. I tried to exit and get into unix but i just could not do 
that. I couldn't hang up as well. does anybody know how to deal w/ that?
also, do i have to get into unix everytime i wanna talk to somebody?
thanx in advance!!

What's really funny is, your whole post had the =20 problem.  And you're
THE Pine man. :)

    David's article was generated by Pine using Pico's automatic word-
wrapping, which leaves a space at the end of each line.  Normally, this
does not trigger quoted-printable encoding, but as the message text
quoted following David's post contained a .signature with 8-bit data,
that 8-bit data triggered Q-P encoding, making the spaces visible as
the =20 hexadecimal MIME sequence.
    Had David not included the 8-bit .signature in the quoted text, this
Q-P encoding would not have appeared.  However, in any mail sent out
with 8-bit characters, quoted-printable encoding will be used, rendering
the end-of-line spaces visible.

I have seen the same problem. It happens when the program you paste from
uses LF (^J) to mark end of line instead of CR (^M). I have seen this
with SGI xwsh and in some PC/Mac terminal programs. I have no good suggestion
on how to avoid this.

Sometimes it is necessary to watch the process of sending mail
(you are not sure with the correct address, a lot of gateways between
etc.). In normal ucbmail I have the option  of verbose -v which forces
sendmail to deliver in verbose mode. Would it be possible to incorporate
this possibility in PINE (on key e.g. CTRL- SHFT- X )? (like send and Send).

Well, in December around the 24th according to my calendar, but I think,
as far as I am concerned, he means the Winter Solstice - June 24th.

I'm certainly not swimming at present :-)

   Hello all,

     Allright,  I will admit it I love Pine.  However despite this new
   devotion to the mail/editor package I have one small pet peeve.
   I would like that when I reply to a message and choose to include
   the old message in the reply it ends up below my signature file.
   I would like to change this so that the signature is the last
   thing to come up.  Right now I manually delete it and then import
   it at the end.  This is not a solution ... just a way to avoid 
   the problem.

Ummm...perhaps I missed something here, but why don't you just edit the
"feature-list" field of your .pinerc file (configuration file) so that pine
places the signature at the bottom of your message? i.e. :
  
feature-list=signature-at-bottom

People often also use the feature called "old-growth" that has a lot
of previous version compatibility stuff...My feature-list looks like

feature-list=old-growth,signature-at-bottom

Is there any way to get Pine always to present me with a RichText header 
in Compose?  I save outgoing mail in different folders using Fcc:, which 
means I have to ^R every time.
Thanks,

In the message text, put the words "Let me know whether you got this
message", and usually you get a message back from the person.

Does anyone know if there is a way to unrotate newsgroup articles that
are mailed to you?  I've got several saved in a folder and can't figure
out how to unrotate them.
Thanks,

If mail to dgmac1@cc.monash.edu.au will be delivered to you, try setting
"use-only-domain-name=yes" or "user-domain=cc.monash.edu.au" in your .pinerc
file.

Have the results from the polling for the institution of a newsgroup for 
pine come through yet?  And how long will the setup take, do you think?  
Just asking cos I'm curious to see what the progress is...

I made the following mods in building pine on a kindred system.  I
believe these are all known to the Pine team.

BTW, you should check your mail configuration.  Your return address was

Subject: Pine & ispell - alternate spell-checker.

I hope the following is an accurate summary of the ways you can 
use ispell with pine.  Please correct as necessary.
I think we should have a pine FAQ, and this should go in it.

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>
 - Set 'editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell' in your '.pinerc' file.
 - See 'man ispell' for more information on the ispell program.

Now, when you press ^_ (^-) in pine, you will execute the 'ispell'
program in its native mode.  Press "?" for help.  Press "I" to 
insert unknown words into the personal dictionary.  You can still
press ^T to use the standard pine spell-checking program (which 
will -not- use your personal dictionary).

From: David L Miller <dlm@cac.washington.edu>
Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable.  I notice that someone
posted a shell script that allows ispell to be used like spell, ...
 
From: Mike Grupenhoff <kashmir@snare.dorm.umd.edu>
I'm not sure this is the correct way, but I just created the following 
script and named it "spell."
     #!/bin/sh
     ispell -l | sort | uniq
It pretty much mimics spell's behavior.  Of course, there's probably a 
better way, but this has worked for me.

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>
To make ^T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words' dictionary:
 - make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory
 - make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell'
 - set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL $HOME/spell'
   (you may include this command in your .cshrc or .login file)

Now, when you press ^T in pine, you will execute the 'ispell' program, 
and it will recognize words stored in the private dictionary.  The 
screen display will look like pine is using the standard spell-checking 
program.  Unfortunately, this method does not allow the user to "I"nsert
words into the private dictionary.  However, this might be useful with a
central script file (setenv SPELL ...)  and a central private dictionary
(ispell -p ...)  to provide a common private dictionary for an entire 
workgroup.  The manager could add items to the private dictionary; 
ordinary pine users would use the private dictionary (^T), but they 
could not change it.

From: Mike Brudenell <pmb1@tower.york.ac.uk>
...As long as people who don't use ispell aren't overlooked!

that is present on virtually every UNIX system under the sun as against

Subject: Re: Use ispell as standard speller, with modified commands?

Well, maybe I'm the computer illiterate; I didn't realize that 'ispell' is
not available on every unix system.  It certainly would be helpful if
users could add words to the spell-check dictionary.  I get tired of being
told that weekday abbreviations are spelled wrong, and my last name, and
'diskette',
'telnet',            [ See P.S. below; spell error is reported here. ]
'email'(!), etc. 
   I can see the advantage of using a standard unix utility (spell).  Is
'ispell' hard to obtain & install?  Is it worth building 'ispell' hooks
into pine? 
   In the meantime ... If ispell is installed on your system, andif you
want to use it (so you can add words to the spelling dictionary), follow
the detailed instructions in my earlier summary message describing how to: 
(1) use ispell in native mode (via the ^_ key), and (2) use ispell in pine
mode (via the ^T key and an executable script file).  If you missed that
message, let me know and I will send or repost it.  If you have any 
corrections to that message, please let me know.  Thanks to all who
explained the details of ispell.  I like it!  

P.S.:  In spell-checking this message (using 'spell' via ^T key), 
I discovered the following anomaly:
 - the following 1 line produces 3 spelling errors:
and 'diskette', 'telnet', 'email'(!), etc. 
 - the following 3 lines produce -no- spelling errors:
'diskette', 
'telnet', 
'email'(!), etc. 
BUT WAIT ... If you spell check this message just as it is before you, 
the three errors (email, diskette, telnet) will be reported in the list
at the top of the message, BUT ... if you remove this P.S. and run the
spell-check again, NO ERRORS will be reported!  SO ... the errors are
being -found- in the sentence:
... and 'diskette', 'telnet', 'email'(!), etc. 
but the errors are being -reported- at the first occurrence of the words
in the message (the list at the top).  Very strange!  What's up?  
   When I checked the spelling using ispell native mode (via the ^_ key),
the three words (email, diskette, telnet) were -always- reported; but once
I add them to my private dictionary, I'll never see them again.  AND ...
ispell even told me that 'occurrance' should be spelled 'occurrence' and
allows me to make the replacement by pressing just one key!  
I like ispell.  -mr

Everything I've seen so far relates to using ispell with pine, not pico.
I just tried the ^_ key in pico, and it is an 'unknown command'.
Pine-folks:  Is ^_ (alternate composer) supported in -pico-?
             Is there a .picorc file?  Should there be?
             How can we get ispell (native mode!) to work in -pico-?

Subject: Using 'ispell' in pine & pico via ^T !!!

There -is- a good reason to implement the 'ispell' program via ^T (CTRL-T)
(using the script file) in addition to implementing it via ^_ (CTRL-_): 
  - use ^_ in -pine- (it won't work in pico) for full-featured ispell;
  - use ^T in -pico- to use the ispell program and your .ispell_words
    dictionary.  NOTE -- It will look just like the old ^T spell-checker
    but it will not flag errors which have been added to your private
    .ispell_words dictionary.  It will -NOT- allow you to "I"nsert words
    into your privat dictionary, and it will -NOT- offer suggestions for
    correct spellings.  But it is an improvement for pico spell-checking!
You can use ^T-ispell in pine also, but why bother when ^_ works better.

In the northern hemi-sphere, that is. Winter Solstice for our friends 
down under. :) Of course, for those of you in the beyond the orbit 
of Neptune, 3.90 will have already been released by the time you read this.

Also, I tried lth.se but PINE is no longer there (or I couldn't find it)

Thanks,
Binh Nguyen

Subject: Rotating 'random' signatures.
Date: 31 May 1994 10:54:08 -0700
Message-Id: <2sftk0$hpq@wolf.CS.Arizona.EDU>

Someone's bound to ask sooner or later, so here's a simple approach to
getting a different signature, chosen at 'random', each time you start
up pine.  (Getting a random signature each time you enter pine's
composer is also possible, but more complicated.)  This is for a UNIX
system; I tested it on a Sun workstation running Solaris 2.3:

-------------------------snip snip snip--------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh -

pinesig=$HOME/.pinesig          # what 'signature-file=' is in your .pinerc
realpine=/usr/local/bin/pine    # pathname to the real pine executable
sigfile=$HOME/sigs              # pathname to your file of signatures

#
# Write a 'random' signature to signature-file:
#

/bin/nawk 'BEGIN { RS=""}
                 { sigs[NR] = $0 }
           END   { srand(); print sigs[randint(NR)]}
#	   END   { srand(); print "--"; print sigs[randint(NR)]}
         function randint(n) { return int(n * rand()) + 1}' <$sigfile >$pinesig
#
# Now run the real pine executable
#

exec $realpine
-------------------------snip snip snip--------------------------------------

Call the script 'pine' and put it somewhere in your $PATH ahead of the
real pine executable.  The script uses awk to suck in a file of
signatures; each signature is separated by a blank line, like so:

Jim Davis               | "Get the telescope out of the hall closet, Ed."
jdavis@cs.arizona.edu   |  -- Mrs. Bighead

Jim Davis               | "1.1, 1.2, 1.3, let's rock!"
jdavis@cs.arizona.edu   |   -- Elma 'Cooder' Fingerwood

Jim Davis               | "I love making him do that."
jdavis@cs.arizona.edu   |   -- Clarissa Darling

awk stores the sigs in an array, and then chooses one at 'random' and
writes that to your signature-file.  Once that's done, the script
calls the real pine program.

If you want your signature preceded by a "--" line, the way (t)rn
does, then uncomment the second END statement (and comment out the
first).

   --Alex  

Hi,
   Filtering mail in pine is a two step process.  First you have to
use a filter program such as elm filter or procmail (both of these
filtering programs can be used with any mailer).  In the case of the
elm filter program, you have to create .elm directory with a
filter-rules file.  You also have to create a .forward file in your
home directory. Then, once you have that, then you only need edit the
incoming-folders variable in your .pinerc file.  I.e., if you filtered
all incoming mail from Bob Smith to your ~/mail/Bob_stuff folder, you
would edit the incoming-folders line to read:

incoming-folders=~/mail/Bob_stuff

  If you have more than one incoming folder (I.e., AnotherFolder and
LastFolder), you would edit the line to read:

incoming-folders=~/mail/Bob_stuff,
	~/mail/AnotherFolder,
        ~/mail/LastFolder

For more information, type: man filter  
                                            -Melanie

Hi,  I've had a user run into a conflict with the way Pine handles MIME 
vs other mailers.   I've included his message for the details (headers 
and all).

	Thanks.

Subject: PINE BUG

I have been installing a new version of elm and I have
run into an odd problem with pine.

If I am in pine and I receive a message that has a file attachment,
if I reply to that message and ask for the current message to
be included in my reply, pine also includes the attachment.

(This sounds like a bug by itself)

OK. Now I am in pine's compose function, and I go to the Attachment
line and remove the attachment. I add my comments to the message
and send it.

Pine does not see fit to remove all of the MIME headers in the
message. Although pine seems to be able to ignore all of this baggage
in the header and message body, other mail programs like elm treat the
message as a MIME message . . . which is a pain given that the message
isn't really a MIME message.

Is there anyway of fixing this? Or at least reporting the bug?

The message that results from the above procedure looks something like:

The mail from Paul is very long but is definitely no flame, but describes

This absolutely nonsense. If this would be true, then you MUST encode 
the first body part of every mail in addition. This is not done, therefore
there is definitely no requirement to do it for every attachment.

If you do not offer the possibility to specify the content-type of the
attachment, then you MUST automatically determine the kind of the attachment.
In case of text files used as attachment you have to scan the file which
will be attached and determine if it is a text file or not. If the file
uses only chars out of US-ASCII then no encoding should be done. If some
of the chars are from an 8-bit code then quoted-printable has to be used.
BASE64 should be used only for the rest of the files.

Using BASE64 always as the encoding means the progam is just not smart
enough.

Using no encoding for US-ASCII, quoted-printable for ISO-... and
BASE64 for others is absolutely compliance with the MIME standards. 
quoted-printable was exactly defined for such purpose. There is no sentence
in the whole standard which implies or suggests to use BASE64 for every
body part.

They are. FTP has two modes for transfering files, if you remember. One
for text files, which is the default and one for binary files and that
one you have to request explicitly.

Non MIME aware user agents will be around for years. The aim of all extensions
made by IETF working groups is backward compatibility. pine is not committed to
this.

In addition using BASE64 as encoding will increase the size of files at about
30 % .

No, definitely no. I have seen no one which encodes their text files
with uuencode if the charset is US-ASCII, as it is for most mail messages.
uuencode is ONLY used for non-US-ASCII text files like files from 
Wordperfect or MS-Word or for binary files.

It is wishable that everybody uses MIME capable UAs, but this has nothing
to do with using the wrong encoding.

Yes, but to all these posters, Greenwich time is 8 hours or more ahead of them, 
if summer time does not deceive me, so the solstice will come along about 
sunrise. Still Tuesday, tho. :-)

	Ok, so this is going to ruin my reputation, it is ACTUALLY my 
users that want jove and pine to work together.
	I want to so when you hit compose, it will get into jove 
automatically, and you don't have to first get into pico, and then hit 
control-whatever to call up jove...
	I'd also be interested in how pine remaps pico's keys all the time...
Thankx a lot

I'm having a major problem re-reading saved read-mail
or first reading of new mail if opened in Pine.  All words in a single 
line are in correct order, but lines are completely disordered.  Most of 
the time, lines are intermingled with lines from the previous or the 
following letter.
Needless to say, this is more than a little frustrating.
I checked with the help dept. here at WU, but when they look at the mail, 
it is (to them at least) apparently correct.  They therefore had no 
suggestions.  I have now deleted almost all of my read mail but still 
have the same problem with the remaining few.

Suggestions in plain, non-technical English will be welcome.

Your messgae is a little unclear...Do ya want to send "zip" files is that 
it??? if ya do you have to "uuecode" them on Unix.... thats the only

have to uuencode a ziped file otherwise the other person will get a

ya wanna get a "ziped" file or a file you know contains "machine codes" 
youll have to set it to "binary"  "ftp>" should default to binary but 
Unfortunatly it doesnt... However if ya can get "ncftp" which is a ftp 
program...that makes everything a little easier....espescially when 
"ncftp" defaults binary transfers....So....Hmmmm I hope this 
helps...Maybe Im reading too much into your letter... Someone help me out

That must be because your sysadmin have enabled that feature
for all users.  Type `pine -conf` and look at the feature list.
You should find that "enable-suspend" is one of the features.
By default, ^Z is disabled unless setup otherwise in your own
.pinerc file or in the system-wide one.

I'd like to do the same thing, but the command "dos2unix" is not

Alternately, is there another command I could use, once the file is on 
the Unix server?

Hi again,
	In the time space of approx. 10 hours, I have received exactly 39 
email messages from this list (most of them asking "how do I do this? 
Where's the FAQ?"). I (and Australia?) haven't got comp.mail.pine yet, so 
I don't know if this message is being sent to the newsgroup. Please 
ignore if you are reading this through news.

	I would think that approx. 100 messages within a 24-hour period 
is enough justification to implement some sort of digest-readable format 
for those of us whose primary use of pine is to read email about anything 
else NOT to do with pine!

	My inbox is in your hands. Pine roolz, elm sux. I just wish I 
could look at my inbox index and say "wow, there's some important email 
over there, I better read that first. Thank goodness I subscribe to all 
high-volume email lists in digest format!"

... yes, I know about procmail.


cheers,

Date: 1 Jun 94 14:00:36 +1200
Message-Id: <1994Jun1.140036.1@csc.canterbury.ac.nz>

I use pine on a Unix system, but don't know if I have the latest version (it
mentions 3.0 at the start), and haven't tried any pc versions. That doesn't
stop me from asking lots of idiot questions, though... ;-) so here goes:

1) Is there an OS/2 version of pine (one that interacts with OS/2's own
   sendmail, perhaps, in place of LaMail, and supports drag-and-drop)?

2) Is it possible to get Pine to respond to encoded files sent from Pegasus
   mail users (that extract into the right format automatically when read
   by Pegasus mail, but need manual mucking around with otherwise)? Pegasus
   mail, IMHO, has probably the nicest user interface of any mailer I've used,
   with pine second.

3) I sometimes use pine from terminals with local printers attached, sometimes
   not - but I want to use the L (local print) key in both cases - using the
   default lpr command if a local printer doesn't exist - can this be set up?
   I can't print to an attached printer from a Unix script at the moment, so
   I really want to put something like environment variables in my .pinerc file.

4) Can I select a group of messages that contain a given string, as I can in
   VAX VMS mail? Not just search through them, displaying the messages in turn.

5) What is involved in getting pine on a PC (Linux or DOS or whatever) to use
   a pop3 daemon on the other end of a modem? That is, have people read mail
   at home (without their PC being a mail node per se), and marking mail they
   have read off the list so when they come in to work later on they don't see
   it a second time as new? 

Thanks for any responses,
Mark Aitchison.

	I voted for this new group with the understanding that the information
will be di-directionally gatewayed with the original pine-info mail list.
It seems that the gateway is not quite right.  I've responed to a few
requests on pine-info but never saw the message on comp.mail.pine is
anyone seeing the same thing?

	(Yes, this is a test to see if it makes it to pine-info from
comp.mail.pine.  :-) )

Pine 3.90 will have an option to allow you to enter the alternate editor
automatically when entering the body of the message, but the composer will
still be used for the headers.

Not yet.  We do not have any plans to do an OS/2 port, but there have been
several requests for one...

There is a tiny program called ansiprt in the Pine source distribution
(contrib/utils directory) that can be used to print from a shell script
called by the custom print option...

Pine does not currently support POP.  You can use IMAP over a SLIP/PPP or 
term connection though...

You may be able to make the conversion during the upload process.  For
example, I upload from my PC to the server using Zmodem.  I first give
the Unix command "rz -a" to the server; the "-a" gets rid of the ^M's.
