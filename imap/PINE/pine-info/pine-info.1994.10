Go to the configuration form and find the line 'customized-hdrs'.  Add or 
change the information you want.  For example add:
	Reply-To: abc@tamu.edu
or
	Reply-To: abc@tamu.edu, Organization: ACME Help Services

Note that a comma(,) separate each customized header.

Hope this helps,

Scenario:  user starts composing a message and decides to
use the ^O option to postpone writing.  User then attempts
to re-access the message, and sucessfully is allowed to
continue editing the file.  User then attempts to postpone
editing again, and an endless loop occurs, filling the
drive with a .pine-debug1 file (the first we caught was 75 
megs in size, and the second was 53 megs).  Reproducible
problem.

I have a debug file a couple of megs in size if someone wants
to take a whack at the problem.

Greetings,

I like pine very much, but I don't like waiting for it to do stuff that it 
could be doing in the background while I'm doing something else.

Case in point:

When I post news with Pine, and I'm in the Newsgroups: header, pine starts 
to synchronize either its list of newsgroups, or update its idea of whats
in them... The result, since my nntp-server is 17 hops away at the moment,
is that I wait about 90 seconds to be able to move the cursor to the next
field.   And woe to the poor schmuck who happens to drop back into the
Newsgroups: header as the entire situation occurs all over again...

Now I don't mind if Pine wants to be up-to-date on all of its news information,
but honestly, why cant it do it in the background?

Date: 30 Sep 1994 15:48:44 GMT
Message-Id: <36hc0s$ck9@maelstrom.acton.timeplex.com>

Greetings,

I like Pico fine as an editor, but there are time when I would like to use
an alternate like vi.  No problem you say, because I can set my alternate
editor in my configuration and use it whenever I want...

However, since sometimes, in an effort to do one keystroke I do another, like
CTRL-Z, which causes Pine to crash if I'm Composing new mail with the
internal editor, I would like to be able to save mail that I am composing
periodically.   Unfortunately, Pine doesn't allow you to save mail you
are in the process of composing in the Internal editor.

One solution might be to set my alternate editor to pico (cause I like the
word-wrap) and set the enable alternate editor implicit switch, however,
that precludes me from getting at vi with a handy CTRL-_.

Pine should be more cautious about mail you are in the state of composing;
if it won't autosave it, it should allow you to save it periodically.

WHen I set this to:

etc

Pine has these list up above with INBOX but yet when I hit return on them 
it says file or directory how come?  if I go below to the collective 
folders I think, and I can read the messages areas there.  What have I 
done in the .pinerc that I should do or not do?

PLease email me at hribnak@nucleus.com

	I have a Pentium 60mhz and Crosstalk for Windows.  I experience 
the same thing -- i.e., if I use Ctrl-^ and block and paste text, it 
works fine, but if I use the Copy and Paste from Crosstalk, for each line 
of text the cursor blinks for 20-45 seconds before the text appears on 
the screen.  sometimes it takes so long that my net provider, netcom, 
drops my connection.

I have exactly the same thing with Trumbet beta 15 over SLIP. The debug file 
gives the following trace:

I think and hope it's software.  I wonder, though, if it's because the

What, specifically, did you have to do in PINE's SETUP menu?  I looked at

========= CLIP ======= CLIP ======= CLIP ========= CLIP ======== CLIP ======

I use cut&paste from the Windows clipboard as my mainstay for moving text 
around from msg. to msg.  I am accessing pine (on a unix server) via a 
tnvt220 (telnet) connection via a remote node dialin  to a Novell LAN.  
This is the only way I know of on a barebones telnet access of moving 
text around (given that pine can't copy a marked text block out to a 
file that can be read back into to another msg.).  For me the Windows 
clipboard is not exactly fast, but it's much much faster than I could 
ever type it in (my dial in link is operating at 19200 bps).  Such 
clipboard service is the main reason I stick with windows (since most of 
my apps, like the Novell tnvt200, are DOS programs).

It is possible that your slow windows clipboard performance is due to 
your windows system.ini file not being optimized.  Sorry I can't help you 
there---maybe somebody else on the net can suggest how they optimized 
their windows comm settings for such a situation.

Have you saved the article that you upload as text only (i.e. ascii)? 
This is the problem that I had when I first tried to do this. You can 
check to see if it is the article by opening it in pico. It will show you 
exactly what the other person will receive.

	I also cannot get ^_ to work... any more. We used to use Rainbow
here, but we have recently moved to an all-Windows environment, so we now
use KEAterm 420. Does anybody know why ^_ might not work in this case?

You can do these things with a filtering program like Elm's filter, procmail, 
or deliver. The filtering happens as the mail is delivered so it's independent 
of the mail user agent you're using. Pine has an incoming-folders variable 
which you can use to list all your incoming folders at the top of your folder 
list.  I've written some instructions for using filter which are at 
ftp://ftp.ii.com/pub/ii/Internet/filtering_mail (I'm planning to update this 
soon so please send me suggestions for improvement!).  

For specific questions about...    See...
===============================    ======
Pine                               comp.mail.pine
Elm's filter program               comp.mail.elm
procmail, deliver, etc             comp.mail.misc


Hope this helps,

I also haven't figured out a way to automate this, but I think I'm coming
around to liking this behaviour.  To me it makes sense that the message
that you're forwarding is the only thing after this line:

---------- Forwarded message ----------


And all your info, including your sig, is above this line.  But for people
who want their sig to be the last thing in the message it would be nice
if this were configurable.

Hello all,

The object of the program is to shuffle my signature files around as 
frequently as possible.

I am trying to write a program that will shuffle all the files in 
$HOME/.sig directory and copy one to $HOME/.signature. Also I want the 
program to pass all of its arguments to "sendmail" so the actual mesasge 
will be sent.

This will work GREAT with pine, since pine allows you to specify your 
sendmail program in the $HOME/.pinerc file.

Can anyone help me?

Thanks {please respond in email as i cannot read news often}

Instead of doing that, why don't you make .signature into a named pipe
instead of a regular file, and run a program which writes to it?

For example (bournish shell):

[512]$ mknod FOO p
[513]$ (while [ 1 ] ; do fortune > FOO ; done) &
[1] 24116
[514]$ cat FOO
"The C Programming Language -- A language which combines the
flexibility of assembly language with the power of assembly language."
[515]$ cat FOO
If I had any humility I would be perfect.
                -- Ted Turner
etc.

If you are using pine 3.90, go to "Setup" and choose Configure. Scroll 
down the list until "Signature at bottom". Put an x in this box, exit 
setup and restart PINE. That's it.

I wonder why the author has this backwards.  Wouldn't it make much more 
sense to have the signature default to the bottom and have a 
configuration option to have it at the top?  It sure would elimininate a 
LOT of confusion.

We experience the same problem on our system.  Under PINE 3.87 printing
worked fine.  Under 3.90, lots of subscribers now claim that printing
doesn't work as it used to.  Something changed between the these versions.

I've solved my problem with WinPine thanks to some messages from other 
people on this group. I have a number of PC Mail clients set up on my PC 
and one of them requires a TZ (timezone) varialbe to be set up. Once I'd 
removed this variable from my autoexec.bat file, everything worked o.k.

Has anyone built a version of pine that uses metamail? I really like pine but
the multimedia support is quite limited (compared to what metamail should
provide). Any help or advice on this would be appreciated.

Thanks for the tip.  I too had a TZ variable defined in my environment and 
after taking it out, my PC-PINE 3.90 now sends mail.  BTW, I'm using the 
NetManage winsock.

It seems that pine/pico don't honor (or, at least, aren't aware) of
TMPDIR as the location of what users want their temp.scratch directory
to be.

Any way to have pine/pico use something other than /tmp?

For me the signature-at-bottom variable only works on original messages
and replies.  For forwarded messages it puts my sig below my message
but before the forwarded message, so it's not at the bottom of the 
whole message.  Are you able to get it to automatically go below the
forwarded message?

Thanks,

The redirection needs to go here       ^

so that you have 

(while [ 1 ]; do $HOME/bin/sigchanger >$HOME/.signature; done) &

> -cut here-
>

and you can remove it from here

cat  `ls -utr | head -1`

> sleep 5 #????
> -cut here-


As it stood, the pair of scripts would spawn sigchangers until you hit
your per-user process limit or the process table filled up. 

With the change, the while loop forks a sigchanger, which tries to
write to $HOME/.signature and blocks, since no one is reading the
other end of the pipe. This keeps the while loop from running away.

The shell does indeed issue a wait, same as if you had said:

(while [ 1 ]; do $HOME/bin/sigchanger >$HOME/.signature & wait; done) &

Hope this helps.

Alex

Subject: Hiding Addresses in Pine 3.89
Date: 3 Oct 1994 09:52:13 -0400
Message-Id: <36p2ad$sb6@ucunix.san.uc.edu>


Hello,

I tried to find the answer to my question in the docs but failed 
there so I turn to the group for help.

I am running a small mailing list through Pine 3.89 using a group
alias.  Currently, I simply input the address alias into the To:
field.  Works fine but as the list grows we are getting a really
phenomenal header and some of my subscribers have asked that the
header not identify them so that they can preserve their lurker
anonymity.

Going to a Bcc: field seems to be one option but it is another step
right now.  I don't want to configure a new header for a variety of 
reasons and was hoping that there was a way to set things up so 
that group aliases simply don't spit out into the whole net.

Oh yes, one other rub here, the sysadmins in their power are not
giving me much access to ways to configure Pine there.  Is that
them or is it Pine 3.89?  I have access to Pine 3.90 on another
account and really do prefer that version.  This list is growing by
leaps and bounds and so I am really locked  into solving this Pine
problem in a hurry.

TIA,

When I send files by Pine they arrive in MIME and receivers of my mail 
need a way to decode them.  Is there any simple MIME software to which 
you could refer me so files I send via Pine could be translated by my 
relatively non-technical friends?  Suggestions would be much appreciated!

Wow - what a wierd and wonderful idea - how on earth did you come to try 
that.
Believe it or not, removing the SET TZ=value from the AUTOEXEC.BAT solved 
my problems also!

I have emailed pine-bugs with the good news.

Of course, this is not a solution, as we do actually need to set the 
timezone (the piece of email I sent myself from Windows Pine under OS/2 
said it came from the PDT timezone, which is Pine's default).

  The readme for future enhancements lists PEM or PGP support.  Can 
anyone summarize what the leanings are for one or the other, i.e. which 
one is likely to be included and why?  I know why one would want either 
system, I am just trying to gauge sentiment favoring PEM or PGP over the 
other in the pine community.

I have pine 3.90 installed on a box running FreeBSD 1.1.5.1 and I can 
read the news just fine but cannot post.  I am running c-news and only 
have local news.  Pine complains that it cannot find an nntp server.
I tried localhost and the host name to no avail.  Is it possible to post 
to local news only under Pine 3.90?

When I first installed pine 3.90 on a Sequent with ptx 2.1, Pine ran very fast with very 
little wait at all.  Three weeks later, I run pine and it will take 3 minutes to go into 
menu screen, and another three mintues to go into folders screen.  When I run top it 
show very little cpu time.

Running elm is still very quick.  Any ideas what to check on as to why it is running so 
slow.

Why can not pine read the MH folders?

I have set the #mh infront of the folder in .pinerc.

Pine say that the folder is empty but i have messages stored in MH
format in them (eg a separate file for each message).

Is there any way to activate your address book (using ^T) on a header
line that you have custom created? (I have a long personal mailing list
that I would rather keep local and not stick into /etc/sendmail/aliases
but I _don't_ want people to have to flip through pages of headers if
they've a decent mail program. So I added a custom line "Apparently To:"
that works fine except for the address book.) Any suggestions, comments
would be very welcome!

Thanks,

Hi,
I have compiled Pine 3.90 for BSDI v1.1. With default configuration pine 
can not see user mail spool. The mail spool directory is in /usr/var/mail. 
So I've made a change in pine/pine-use.c to reflect the machine user mail 
spool directory. But still, pine  can't see spool directory.

Any idea?

Try using the new ansi printing feature to "print" messages to your 
terminal program.  If you configure the terminal program printer to print 
to a file... you can essentially "download" on the fly.

Many hp terminals can do ansi or vt100 emulation.  We send the escape 
sequence to switch to ansi mode beroe launching pine, then switch back 
after exiting.  Sophisticated users may prefer to switch manually.

Thinking 'pine' is a great tool (really!), I was somewhat disappointed that
mails having 80 characters on some lines were truncated: although the
used terminal/window had 80 characters per line, lines with 80 characters
were truncated to a next line...
Does anyone have a solution on how to overcome this problem?
by the way: 'elm' does not have this problem...

A user of mine reported a bug in pine. I've been able to reproduce the 
bug sucessfully on a D-G and a SV4 build (latter being on a Solaris 
system).  

I have been able to reproduce the bug by doing the following:

LIST Folders
Open news collection
Goto (G command) to a specific group name
Delete a few articles
List folders (L command)
Open news collection
G specific group name
   Top status line still says old group line
   Bottom status line says Opening "new group name"

Bombs with...

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".

A while ago I wondered why my updated PC-Pine 3.90 (with FTP Software's 
PC/TCP 2.31) won't send mail. After contacting my system management, we
were able to locate the problem why PC-Pine 3.90 cannot contact our SMTP
server (Zmailer).

>From the log of our SMTP-server when I tried to send mail:
  24682r  HELO [N]
  24682w  500-  ^
  24682w  500 Illegal input characters: 8-bit char on SMTP input

So, is this a bug in Pine ? Or is it just our server being too picky ?

I have seen this thread before without an answer. I belong to a very busy
list and receive close to 100 posts a day from it. I attempted to have it
filtered to a folder but -- no go. Someone said earlier that it was not 
possible but I have seen it done by others without scripts or additional
software. Huh?

Hello,

  Just wondering if it is possible to put a the file-name instead of the 
options specified. I'd like to put something like:

saved-msg-name-rule=saved

  instead of

saved-msg-name-rule=default-folder

  that saves to saved-messages. The thing is I automatically save all my
read mail in saved but with the s command I have to specify a name each
time because I can't ``redefine'' default-folder.

thanks.

It's possible, but just not possible with Pine alone, which is the
Mail User Agent, and has no control over delivery. 

There are several programs, filter (part of the elm distribution),
procmail, deliver, and others that can do delivery filtering for 
you. Some of them can be run, installed as root, as a partial replacement 
for sendmail, but most can be run unpriviledged by a single user
by using the .forward file to direct all mail to this filtering 
program. 


The feature that Pine has that makes it useful when used with a 
delivery filter, but which often confuses people into thinking 
that it can do that filtering, is the ability to be configured
to notify you of new mail delivered to a set of several folders
other than the default INBOX. So, if you have some mail redirected
to another folder, you will still get a new-mail from ... message. 


If you don't need *delivery* filtering, mush, and the latest version of 
Pine (also probably MH, and others I'm not familiar with) both let you 
apply a command to a whole series of messages. For example, in Pine
you can select all messages addressed To: a particular mailing list,
and then either Zoom in on them ( show only those messages in the
display ) or Apply a Save to another folder command to them. )

 Does PINE version 3.89 support PGP data encryption?  If so, how would
 one go about installing the program to encrypt mail "on the fly"?  If
 PINE version 3.89 does not support PGP data encryption, does version
 3.90 or do I have to wait for later versions to receive PGP support?

Steve et al:
This isn't quite correct.  Due to performance concerns, Pine only keeps 
the "current" and "inbox" folders open, so those are the only two you 
will get "immediate" (i.e. within 2.5 min)  new mail notification in.

In the future we will be investigating ways to improve this.

For now, I think the main virtue of Pine's "Incoming Msg folders" is that
you can press TAB at the end of the Index and Pine will see if there are
any Recent messages in each of the listed folders.  This *reduces* the "out
of sight, out of mind" problem that delivery to multiple folders sometimes
causes.

I am guessing, but I don't think the above will work.  (Maybe if you edit 
.pinerc directly, but I have my doubts.)

I don't know if this is acceptable or not, but you could try setting 
'read-message-folder'.  This saves all read messages into a folder and 
can be done automatically.  For more info, go to the configuration screen 
and press F1.

  I've done this to automaticly save my read messages to my ``saved''
folder. But if I try to use the S command, it saves to ``saved-messages''
and not to ``saved''. 

Thanks for the help thought.

I have the same frustrating problem. I read the faq and pulled down
mpak for the mac and it kinda seems to works sometimes..when sending
mail to my work address but now I've lost the site with all that
stuff and I have friends dos/windoze types who need mpak or similar
so we can send attached files.
Please, somebody help us, Please!
Many thanks,
Bret

Pine-use is a standalone utility to check on Pine usage and is not compiled
into Pine itself.  The place you need to make the change is in c-client
(imap/ANSI/c-client/os_bsi.h)...

Well, I'm not sure whose bug this is...  PC/TCP is returning garbage on som=
e
versions and we have not found all of the workarounds to make it work
consistently :(

Pine 3.91 will atleast have a filter to prevent the 8bit characters, but it
still may not work completely as we would like...=20

Hi,

When I am trying to email to certain addresses, my machine (running
Linux) complains that:

Command: /bin/sh: /usr/bin/uuname: No such file or directory
sendmail: etoib@etobi.eua.ericsson.se ... deferred: (ERR_127) router uucp_neighbors: command `/usr/bin/uuname' returned exit status EX_32256
sendmail: mail moved to /var/spool/smail/error/0qs74C-0001fmC

Am I missing a file?
Why doesn't this happen every time I mail something?

Regards,
Kjetil.

I've excerpted a MIME doc we have around here that contains the following 
pointer:

 There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
 message.  One of the more versatile is called "munpack".  It was developed
 at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
 host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
 available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
 older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
 decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 

See the FAQ on comp.mail.mime for other alternatives.

	There many times when someone posts a message to a group which
they don't follow. They request responses via email. Many times it
would be appropriate to initially send to the newsgroup as well. I
wonder if the problems is that there is insuficient information in the
headers for the pine to determine if the message was posted, as well
as mailed.

	I don't know what the problem is, but I haven't been able to get 
	Munpack to decode any attached messages sent with Pine.  Munpack
	gives me the message "Nothing to unpack."  Yet when I look at the

: Exactly this mode of operation is one of our goals, but we have quite a long

At compose mode; the pine could simply recognize it's not connected any
longer and save the message into special a folder for instance TO_SEND
This shouldn't be very hard. Worse is, how to process this folder as a
dozens of waiting messages to be sent. As the format of folder is
straightforward some third-party program could take over this job.

Subject: Bug in pine?  IOT Trap?
Message-Id: <Cx5uJ8.6FI@watserv1.uwaterloo.ca>
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 18:11:31 GMT

I am using pine on a NeXT machine and am receiving the following error message
when I try to exit from pine.

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
IOT trap

This message only occurs when I have mail in my inbox.  If I do not have any
mail in my inbox (for example, if I have expunged it), the message still shows
up the first time I exit pine, but then disappears if I go into and exit
pine again.

If I simply delete my messages without expunging them and then exit pine, and
answer yes to the prompt "expunge messages?", I get the above error and my
messages never get expunged.

Can anyone help me?

Hello
Has anyone got a diff to pine 3.90 so that it will work in a HP-UX hpterm

It works for an xterm but the cursor keys are messed up - guess it is HP's

Many terminal programs allow you to scroll backwards in a screen buffer, 
and even copy material from the buffer. 

However, pine (unlike elm) does not copy the replied-to msg into buffer,
so you can't glance at the msg, should you want to check something there
while responding - or copy a detail from it etc. 

Is it possible to add such a feature in coming versions of pine? If not 
permanent, it could be an option you could choose in setup/configure.

Is there a way to turn off the "feature" of monthly pruning- the process of 
pine asking you at the begining of each month:


	Disk space is limited. Delete "sent-mail-MMM-YYYY" ? 

I have looked through pine.conf, .pinerc, man pine and the help in Setup
for any configuration or feature switch that might apply but I can find 
nothing.  What am I missing?  I find this to be the most agrivating part
of an otherwise friendly program.

It seems from discussions with other users that the problem is that some
(many?) newsreaders supply too much information when replying via mail.  That
is, they include a Newsgroups: header even though the message was not posted
to the newsgroup!  Pine sees the Newsgroups: header and assumes that the
message was posted as well as mailed.  AFAIK, there is nothing that Pine can
do to tell that the Newsgroups: header is a lie...

Hi netters,
Just wondering how to set up nntp server in the .pinerc in order to read and 
post news through the pine?
Any help is being appreciated.
Thanx very much!

Message-Id: <Cx70wx.LzJ@discus.technion.ac.il>

Hi,
	All my efforts to define my fcc folder on my PC version of pine failed
and I wonder why. I tried defining it on my pc, specifying 

default-fcc     sentmail

and on my remote unix machine by typing

default-fcc:    chermesh {bgumail.bgu.ac.il}sent_mail

	In both cases, the response I get is:

CREATE failed: Can't create mailbox mail/savemail: no such file or directory

	Well, the problem is that both my sent_mail folder exists on my unix
account and on my mail directory on my pc.

			Ran

p.s. Funny as it may sound, the pc folders were operative on version 3.89
     I've never tried the remote directory mode on 3.89.

Hi,

You need to set these two lines in your .pinerc (either through editing 
or through the configuration screen.  (One note: I think you only supply 
*{ttd1.ttd.teradyne.com/nntp}[] on the news-collection line and pine 
fills in the subscribed groups.)  Also, to state the obvious, you must 
change ttd1.ttd.teradyne.com to whatever you nntp server is.

nntp-server            = ttd1.ttd.teradyne.com
news-collections       = Subscribed-Groups *{ttd1.ttd.teradyne.com/nntp}[]

Hope this helps,

I use pine3.90, can read and post to localhost with a port redirected to
my remote nntpserver and works with a term connection. This is with 
Linux 1.1.50. Pine thinks it's posting to localhost, even in actuality,
its not. This is due to the NNTPSERVER environment variable being set
as localhost.

Hope this helps.

This is not "too much information."  The newsgroups header on email
is informative, and what else is the purpose of information but to
be informative.

Then Pine is stupid for making such an assumption.

The "Newsgroups:" header is not a lie.  There is nothing in RFC822 which
forbids a "Newsgroups:" header in email.  The header informs the email
recipient as to the origin of the discussion.

Might be an os dependent problem? I constantly postpone and
re-edit, repostpone up to 5 messages (the most I've had in
the queue) and have had no problems. This as a regular user.

In fact, I think this is one of the best new features they in-
corporated in pine, to allow a queue of postponed messages.

I recently tried to compile for a BSD/386 BSDI 1.1 0 os and pico 
kept failing at alt_editor (osdep.c from os_unix.c) and pine 
kept failing at sstrcasecmp [(pipe) appended to os-bsi.c]. Did
you get any warnings during the make ?

Subject: Pine c-client patch for DG/UX: utime() problem

Pine 3.90 has a problem on DG/UX systems when using utime() to modify folder
access and mod times.  The result, folders getting weird modification 
dates, especially after an expunge operation. The folders most often were
set to Dec 31, 1969 (epoch) or some other strange date.

The problem is, the code defines...

time_t tp[2];

... and then passes tp into utime().  On DG/UX, utime actually is looking
for four doubles. Each time is actually two time_t's, the second being in
microseconds!!!

If the struct utimbuf is used, it will work on DG/UX. I checked a SunOS
and Solaris system and they both define utimbuf with members actime and 
modtime as well. 

The patch that is mime-attached to this message just patches the files to
use utimbuf and does NOT put #ifdefs around anything. If this is a bad 
thing, then this patch will break some other system out there.

I, and other DG users who told me they seen the same problem at other sites, 
would appreciate it if some type of fix for this could be folded into 
future releases ... and we all really appreciate the d-g build option in 
there already!  Compiling was a breeze!

Hi,

There are 2 options here, first you can setup a folder 
(folder-collection) through the configuration screen.  With this, you can 
save messages to folders locally on you PC's hard drive.

If you are just trying to save a message to your hard drive, then use 'E' 
to export the message and specify the filename(and path if desired).

Hope this helps...

What is your system type?   We had that exact same problem.

I *just* posted patches to fix this problem for DG/UX systems. The 
utime() call should have a utimbuf struct passed to it on all systems 
that I've checked on instead of assuming it is a two-element array of 
time_t vars (longs).

Maybe the patch will fix your problem as well, even if you don't have DG/UX.

Hi,

Pine 3.90 doesn't want to compile on VAX/VMS with the VAX C compiler - when I
tried today I got lots of warnings of the form

%CC-W-EXTERNNAMELONG, The external identifier name exceeds 31 characters

Comments anyone?

We're looking for a way in which pine can only be used to mail to LOCAL 
users.  We wish to make the easy interface available to our clients, but 
do not wish them using our system as a sending point for mail to the 
world.  Ideally a config option along the line of:

local-only

Which would disallow the "@" sign in an address.

Any suggestions for workarounds with the present format?

Hi All,

In the help given with Pine for Windows, it mentions
that presently a local signature file and local
addressbook has to be used.  We would like to get
pine for Windows going with IMAP such that it
doesn't matter which PC or terminal a users runs
pine from.

However, with the requirement for a local sig file
and local addressbook, this is harder to achieve.

Two main queries :-

Is (and when) it planned that a future version of
pine (and IMAP?) will be able to use remote
addressbooks and signature files.

How do people use the IMAP pine from different
PCs and terminals semi transparently.  (i.e.,
do users download a central addressbook file and
sig file?).  

Ideas and comments appreciated.

Lachlan.

	This is the message I get when using Pine in a DECterm which is sized
at something other than the default 24 x 80: 

	Unaligned access pid=26005 <pine> va=14008a174 pc=1200752f4
ra=1200752e8 type=stq

	When I go into an index (and this is the only time it occurs), with
the setup different to the default (such as now, it is 48 x 132), this is
what I get, and the longer the index, the more I get; sometimes pages of
these messages (arranged rather messily, not one per line or anything), if I
enter a large index. Does anyone have any idea what may be causing this?
Thanks.

well, this happens on the DEC C compiler too. You have two choices, 
1. change the identifier to be shorter everywhere
2. use a #define to define it in os-vms.h

It would be nice if they don't show up in the source at all, this is just 
one of many issues when porting Pine to VMS.

In Pine 3.07 I could open a session on a newsgroup from the command line 
quite concisely:

	pine -if \*comp.mail.pine

The tersest I can manage with 3.90 is 

	pine -if \*\{news/nntp\}comp.mail.pine

Am I overlooking something obvious?

Assuming you are using Unix pine (?), you need to save the messages in a
folder within your directory, then transfer the file to your PC where you
can work with it.  The transfer procedure depends which terminal program
you are using-- give us more details or ask for local help.

Sending a message prepared on your local is the reverse procedure-- 
transfer the file to your unix directory, then (R)ead it into your pine 
message buffer.  Make sure you save the file from your word processor in 
generic ASCII format.

Hello everyone,

I have not found any information concerning this, however 
please excuse me if I have overlooked it.

My question is does Unix Pine support Hazeltine 1500 emulation?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Pine can (I and others use the MH-folder format with Pine for some time 
now).

Some excerpts from my .pinerc:

# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).
inbox-path=#mh/inbox

(Note that you can also use inbox-path=#MHINBOX)

# List of directories where saved-message folders may be. First one is
# the default for Saves. Example: Main {host1}mail/[], Desktop mail\[]
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}optnl-directory-path[]
folder-collections="My Mail" #mh/[]

There is this small bug (which will be fixed in 3.91) in the MH-driver 
that might affect you. If you have your MH-folders somewhere else then in 
~/Mail try moving the Path: setting in ~/.mh_profile to the first line in 
the file.

Xander

Look for an entry in your .pinerc that looks something like this:

  last-time-prune-questioned=94.10

Then edit the date to be sometime far in the future...

FYI: For the normal nntp situation, you can actually omit setting the
news-collections variable explicity.  If you just set "nntp-server" then
Pine will infer the typical news-collections entry.

Questions relating to procmail are usually answered a lot faster if
you direct them to the list <procmail@informatik.rwth-aachen.de>

You were probably trying to create lockfiles in a spool directory
lacking the privilege to do so.  You should deliver to your home
directory.  Use the inbox-path variable to teach Pine about it.

Procmail is an efficient mail thrower with its own concise language
and very complex capabilities.  You don't realize what a magnitude of
tasks its users have been delegating to procmail.

For the simplest applications like sorting out list mails the syntax
is very easy and documented in the manual.  But even here you will
have to fine-tune the regular expressions to fit your needs.  Also the
.forward/.maildelivery setup is quite different from site to site.

Therefore I would say, a comprehensive (y/n)?-frontend would require
artificial intelligence.

I am afraid you confused this with Mail's ~/.mailrc.  As far as I know
neither Pine nor Elm allow by default every user to customize the
sendmail program to use.

Often it is desirable for Unix virtuosos to plug in their own sendmail
wrapper that does some additional postprocessing on the composed
message before sending it out.

For Pine (and similarly for Elm) this can be achieved by compiling in
"${SENDMAIL=/usr/lib/sendmail}" instead of /usr/lib/sendmail.  Now, if
I setenv SENDMAIL mysendmail and have such a script in my path it will
be used.  This is exploiting a feature of sh's.

Such a script can do all sorts of fancy stuff.

Not really.  In S)etup C)onfig you can add Return-Receipt-To to the
customized-hdrs and then while composing a message you can enter your
name in the ^R)eturn-R: line to request a delivery notification which
is about as close as you can get.  This return receipt has no legal
value and from many sites it will not even be sent to you.

While that would probably work for one user, I was looking for a config 
flag to put in the system /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, if possible.  I
don't want any of our users to have to put up with the prune 
prompting.

Subject: Headers of Simultaneous Mail & News (was: WARNING FOR PINE 3.90 USERS!!!!!)

Message-Id: <36vi69$3aa@news.halcyon.com>
References: <ellis.780855259@gmi.edu> <36s9o1$153@trance.helix.net> <Pine.ULT.3.90.941004200557.7299C-100000@shiva1.cac.washington.edu> <36t8ok$n8h@mp.cs.niu.edu>

Since Pine 3.90 is the first widely used Mailer-and-Newsreader-in-one, 
it makes sense that it's dealing with header issues that haven't been 
an issue before.

Ideally when a message is received in mail you would be able to tell
whether it was mailed only or both posted and mailed.  That way when
you reply you would know whether it is appropriate to reply by posting
as well as mailing.  (Proper netiquette is to not post private mail.)
Currently I don't think there's any uniform way to determine this from 
the headers (please let me know if there is).

It would be nice if there were standard headers for both mail and news
messages which told:
[1] where the message was mailed (except Bcc)
[2] where the message was posted
[3] where the message originated, i.e., if it's a reply or forwarded
    message where the message that is being replied to or forwarded
    was (newsgroup(s), mailing list(s), non-mailing-list mail)

To:_ and Cc:_ mean [1] most of the time, but some posted messages
might have these headers and not actually have been mailed to the
folks on the To:_ and/or Cc:_ lines.  This would happen with a 
newsreader that doesn't honor To:_ and/or Cc:_ lines and doesn't strip 
them out.

For posted messages Newsgroups:_ satisfies [2].  For mailed messages
Newsgroups:_ sometimes means [2] only, sometimes means [3] only,
and sometimes means [2] and [3].

For the future it might be a good to have standard headers for both
mail and news for [2] and [3].  What do people think?  Of course anything 
adopted would have to be backward compatible with existing RFCs.  

Looking forward to a discussion,
Nancy

The particular issue should not be an issue now.  It is because of a
design flaw in pine.  Let's not try to reinvent the world just to
avoid admitting that this is a design flaw.

>Ideally when a message is received in mail you would be able to tell

If you received the message in mail, then it was mailed.  If you want to
know whether the originator of the message also posted it in a public
forum somewhere -- then you are asking for the ability to read minds
of people you have never met.  That is impossible.

If you received the message by mail, and there is no indication that
it was also posted, proper netiquette is to assume that it was mail.
You do not need any special headers for that.

>Currently I don't think there's any uniform way to determine this from

One can make intelligent guesses.  Cnews and INN have distinctive
message IDs which strongly suggest that the message originated
in news.  But it would be unwise to count on this.

>It would be nice if there were standard headers for both mail and news
>messages which told:
>[1] where the message was mailed (except Bcc)

Why not consider usenet posting as equivalent to "Bcc: everybody".  That
way you can treat it as mail, and your ignorance that it was posted
completely conforms to your desired ignorance as to the content of
the Bcc: addresses.

>[3] where the message originated, i.e., if it's a reply or forwarded
>    message where the message that is being replied to or forwarded
>    was (newsgroup(s), mailing list(s), non-mailing-list mail)

Usually the "Received:" header in mail and the "Path:" header in
usenet news can give you this information.

>To:_ and Cc:_ mean [1] most of the time, but some posted messages
>might have these headers and not actually have been mailed to the

That happens.  It can also happen with email.  It is quite easy to
create an email message with "To:" and "Cc:" headers which do not
correspond to actual recipients.  I suppose this is no worse than a
person sending a paper letter addressed to his lawyer with a "Cc:" to
another person, but the letter is only sent to the other person and
not to the lawyer.

>For posted messages Newsgroups:_ satisfies [2].  For mailed messages
>Newsgroups:_ sometimes means [2] only, sometimes means [3] only,
>and sometimes means [2] and [3].

"Newsgroups:" has a defined meaning for usenet, but has no defined
meaning for email.  As a result, people are allowed to use it for
whatever they like.  I prefer to retain the "Newsgroups:" header in
email replies to postings, and sometimes even in email replies to
email that has a "Newsgroups:" headers, and presumably originated on
usenet.

Perhaps.  But you will probably never get it adopted.  There are too
many existing products which do not honor these to-be-invented
headers, and most people are satisfied with things the way they are.

Strictly speaking, headers which are not specified defined by RFC822 are 
either a ``extension-field'' or ``user-defined-field''.  There are two 
differences between these two:
 1) extension-field is one that is officially registered, and never begins
    with X-.
 2) user-defined-field is any name that is not an RFC822 field or an
    extension-field, and may begin with X-.  Any user-defined-field which
    does not begin with X- may be preempted by an extension-field 
    definition at any time.  By definition, a user-defined-field is
    private and may be interpreted by each implementation as it wishes.

There is no definition of an extension-field of Newsgroups: in the RFC822
context.  It is defined as a *news* field, but that is a separate context
from RFC822 and in fact an entirely different protocol specification.

Consequently, in the RFC822 context it is a user-defined-field.  An RFC822
implementation can do whatever it pleases with any user-defined-field! 

Pine treats the RFC822 context user-defined-field of Newsgroups:  as being
identical to the news context field of Newsgroups:.  Your claim is that
the interpretation of Newsgroups: is different in mail than it is in news. 
There is nothing in the protocol specifications to support your position
or, for that matter, Pine's position; it is up to each implementation. 

This does not mean that the *suggestion* to treat Newsgroups: differently
when reading mail than when reading news is rejected.  I am not aware of
any decision being made either way.  However, whether it is accepted or
rejected will be on its own merits, and not by virtue of a claim that the
specifications say something that they don't.

There is a bug in the mbox driver of 3.90 that *empty* ~/mbox files are 
ignored.  As a workaround, put a single message into it and it will start 
working.

The fix is in the latest IMAP toolkit on ftp.cac.washington.edu, file 
mail/imap.tar.Z, and will also be in Pine 3.91 which is coming soon!!!!

According to the faq you can force all new mail to be pulled into ~/mbox
by linking in the "mbox" driver when you build pine.  I executed the 
following:

	./build EXTRADRIVERS=mbox a32

It seems to have added the mboxdriver to linkage.[ch] and it built fine,
but it seems to have had no effect.  Mail does not get pulled into ~/mbox
ever.  Am I missing a step?  Does it even work?

Start pine with the -d0 flag which means turn debugging off.  I have
the following alias in my ~/.cshrc file so it automatically happens
each time I type pine.

alias pine "\pine -d0"

Hope this helps,

Agreed.

No, that is not correct.  The RFC1036 (news context) only supplies an
interpretation of "Newsgroups:" when it appears in a news article.  RFC1036
does not provide any interpretation of "Newsgroups:" when it appears
in an email message.  If Pine assigns an interpretation to "Newsgroups:"
in an email message, that is Pine's own invention, and it is not in
any way taking the RFC1036 interpretation.

Now perhaps you can say that Pine treats "Newsgroups:" in mail as
analogous to its use in usenet, but you cannot say that it treats
it identically.

Yes, of course the interpretation is different.  There is an
interpretation in news, and there is no interpretation in mail.  If
you don't think that is different, then your way of thinking is quite
strange.

>There is nothing in the protocol specifications to support your position

I agree that the protocol does not specify.  That is why it was wrong
of a previous author to say that the Newsgroups: line in mail was a
lie.

>This does not mean that the *suggestion* to treat Newsgroups: differently
>when reading mail than when reading news is rejected.  I am not aware of

If the author's of Pine want to treat "Newsgroups:" the way they
do - that is their choice.  I have no particular position for
or against this.  I object to them labelling the appearance of
"Newsgroups:" in mail as a lie.  Generally speaking, when there is
no rule, one goes by the common practice, and the common practice
for some time has been for email responses to news to include the
"Newsgroups:" header.  Thus the header has a meaning by an
analogue of common law.  If the Pine author's wish to change this,
they should ideally go the RFC route to do so.  I think such an
attempt would fail, but they have the right to try.

Right now the Pine authors are in the position of the soldier
marching out of step with the rest of the brigade, but declaring that
he is in step and everybody else is out of step.  If the Pine authors
can persuade the rest of the world to fall in step with them -- good
luck to them.  But let's not distort the picture.  They made an
unwise design decision which has embarrassed several users, and they
should not try to shift the blame.

Personally, I don't care very much.  I install Pine because some of
my users ask for it.  Except for testing the installation, I do not
use Pine.  I consider it to be one of the biggest pieces of junk
software and poor design that I have encountered.

And if you're not afraid of getting your hands dirty by touching the

Thanks for your reply. I would just like to make a couple of point:

1. This 'feature' was not in the beta-test versions of VMS Pine

2. I thought that the whole point of porting software is to make it work in the 
   target environment. A 'port' which won't compile is not much use to anyone.

I suppose I'll have to go through the whole code and fix these long identifier
names. And then when 3.91 is released I'll have to do it again. 

Or maybe I'll just stick with the 3.89 beta version. At least it works.

Dave

Hi,

I have just started using Pine. When I receive mail from local users,
Pine shows the To: address instead of the From: address in the
index. For external mail it works correctly. Is there some
configuration variable which would remedy this?

Regards,
Kjetil.

Pine's mailcap support isn't up to its task yet.  But for viewing
images you don't need a mailcap.  Your best bet is to enter xv as the
image-viewer on the last page of Pine's S)etup C)onfig.

This is a personal letter to Viktor Alekseyevich, it looks like it was

It is in the KOI8-R charset documented in RFC 1489, the original header

	Couldn't you just set the inbox in .pine-conf? I think you could
put: 

inbox-path=/usr/var/mail/$USER

in there, and then Pine should be able to see a user's inbox.

Proper newsreader [sic] behaviour is to ignore To: and CC: headers. They
are undefined and thus should be ignored.

Proper mailer behaviour is to ignore Newsgroups: headers. The fact that
brain damaged newsreaders leave them in when composing mailed replies is
not reason to change the current definitions of mail. 

>For the future it might be a good to have standard headers for both
>mail and news for [2] and [3].  What do people think?  Of course anything

The proper course of action is to modify the newsreader software to
include a "post and mail" command. The mailed copies get mail headers,
the posted ones get news headers. 

In no case should a user wind up surprised that his mail got posted by
some intermediate site just because there was an undefined Newsgroups:
header in it, nor should the opposite surprise exist (a copy mailed when
a posted article has an undefined To: header in it.)

(In case you want to claim that that would never happen, I can tell you
of at least one case where in-transit mail was processed by a mailer
which noticed a user name of the form usenet.group.name, and, ignoring
the small detail that it was not the host to whom the mail was
addressed, went ahead and posted the mail. In most cases, this is the
intended result, but in my case it was not. This intermediate mailer had
been in operation for a long time before I caught it doing this; how many
others are there that haven't been?)

This rules out suddenly defining the To: header in news, or the
Newsgroups: header for mail, to mean "inject this package into the other
type of stream".

At best, it means the originating newsreader inserting an
"X-Also-Mailed-To:" or "X-Also-Posted-To:" header in the generated
packages.

I'm curious why you think this.  Could you please post at least 3 features 
(other than the Newsgroups:_ header in a mail message) which you think were 
poorly designed and mailers that do each of these 3 features better.

Thanks,
Nancy

Hi,

Does anyone know if PC-PINE will read dos environment variables. I want 
to set up PINE on our Netware Servers and it would be nive if I could 
have a default pinerc file that uses Dos ENVs for things like FULLNAME and 
USERID.

If you can give us a list of identifiers exceeding 31 characters (do we 
really have some of those?) maybe we can shorten them in our source.  Thanks.

>(other than the Newsgroups:_ header in a mail message) which you think were 
>poorly designed and mailers that do each of these 3 features better.

   1:	It is a bitch to install.

	Read the instructions.  Select the configuration for
	your system, using the 'gcc' compiler.

	Run the build script.  Discover that it doesn't
	use the 'gcc' compiler.

	Read and understand the build script, so that you can
	really use 'gcc', by adding a keyword argument CC=gcc
	on the command line.  Discover that it does a half-baked
	job, using 'gcc' part of the time, and 'cc' part of the
	time.

	Use a 'find' to locate all of the 'Makefile's to find what
	has to be changed to really use gcc.

	Compile.  Have the thing crap out in the middle because a
	system include file is included twice, the first time with
	'const' as itself, and the second time with 'const' redefined
	as ''.

	Build it.  Discover that it makes incorrect assumptions
	about where various things are in your system (such as
	the news active file).  Grep through every directory till
	you find what has to be changed.

	etc.

   2:   It is excessively obese.

	The stripped binary is significantly in excess of 1 meg in
	size.  Much of this is due to the inclusion of help text
	within the binary instead of in a separate help file.  This
	means that an experience user who need no help must
	nevertheless load the help information into memory whenever
	she uses the software.

   3:	It screws up message status of the default mailbox.

   	It always opens my default mailbox, whether I want it to
	or not.  The status of messages in that mailbox changes
	from New to Unread, even though I have not asked to
	read the mailbox, and have not seen the list of messages
	in that mailbox.

   4:	The menu interface is tedious and unintuitive.

   	When reading news, it displays a humongous list of newsgroups
	for me to select from.  I have to actually select each in turn
	to discover that there are no unread messages in that newsgroup.

	After reading one newsgroup, if I want to select another I
	must go back and re-select the news collection, and have it
	redisplay the menu, then I must page through the menu to
	about where I was.  Perhaps I am missing some shortcut here,
	but the keypresses indicated on the screen display do not
	provide a shorter alternative.

   5:	Poorly timed user unfriendly prompts.

	If I read my mail, then spend some time reading usenet, at
	the end it asks me if I really wanted to delete those
	messages from my mailbox.  But that might be so long after I
	asked to delete them that I have forgotten the details.  If
	the program wants to second guess and ask for confirmation,
	it should do it much earlier, perhaps as soon as a different
	folder is selected.

Sorry, but there is no point in my listing other mail programs which
do not have these faults.  I am not aware of any other mail programs
which do have these faults.

I know I'm goona get smacked for this, but any idea on when 3.91 will be

the bug fixes are made...

Subject: PC/Win pine "offline" how ???
Date: 6 Oct 1994 18:11:53 GMT
Message-Id: <371el9$c79@belfort.daimi.aau.dk>

Is it possible to have PC/Win pine work "offline".

It is so that our central e-mail server is a UNIX machine (SCO). Our
PCs pine then fetches e-mails from INBOX and stores mails in mail-
folders on that machine via imap. When the PC's pine send mails they
send it to the UNIX machine with smtp. This works fine as long as
the PC are connected to our Ethernet LAN.

But if the PC's are placed outside the department, telephone connections
has to be used, and that costs a lot of money if the line (e.g. slip
or ppp) has to be open all the time pine is running.

Therefor my question is if it is possible in one or another way to
get pine to "download" the total INBOX to the PC at once, so the 
telephone connection can be closed, and then the user on the PC
can read the mails (local on the pc), reply, Compose etc. and when
finished the telephone line is opened again and the outgoing mails
are sent. All in all to reduce the time the telephone line is open
as much as possible.

The SCO UNIX both has imap(d), ipop and ipop3. I never used other
than imap(d). Can ipop? be used to do what I want ? How is it done
then ?


Hints, advices and suggestions are wellcome


Thanks in advance

I was just wondering.....Pine 3.90 running on an HP automatically 
recognizes attachments that are images and spawns an external 
viewer (XView in my case) to view the image.  

Q. Is there a way to customize Pine to automatically recognize
   other types of attachments and call a program to view them?
   ie.  Call emacs for text files?  WP for .doc files ?

Content-Length: 729


New member of the list here.. Having trouble with the PC
version of the DOS sunpc client of pine.. the Fcc field is 
perplexing.. Is there a way to disable this? If I use default
fcc, it asks me if I want to create \mail\sentmail since it
doesn't exist. if I say yes, it tells me file already exists,
can't create it.. If I say no, it puts me back in edit.
if I change FCC to be by-user, it puts fcc in header.. Only 
by deleting FCC as it is created in the header can I get mail
to be sent.  
  Also, I have gotten:
Bug in Pine detected: "Append Validity Confusion"
several times when sending mail.

Haven't found that documented anywhere.

You need to pipe to munpack -t to decode text attachments also.
I think the -t option was introduced in mpack-1.3.

I'll expand DLM's answer a little.  Like he said, go to Setup/Configure 
and select Add with Customized-hdrs highlighted.  If you want to add an 
organization name your input should be:
	Organization: UCDAVIS Educational Center

You can have more than one custom header by separating them by commas.  
Note, that since you separate your headers by commas, you cannot have 
commas in the header itself.

If I remember correctly from 3.90, it is tenantively set for in a couple 
of weeks.:-)  (Isn't this right DLM?)

More seriously, I don't know and I have a feeling the pine developers 
would hate to make any commitment right now.

When I converted, my alias file was relatively small (<200 aliases) and I 
just copied my alias.txt(I think) to addressbook.  The only real 
difference I believe was that Pine want the Real Name in Last, First 
format and Elm doesn't.  So over time, I just corrected mine alittle at a 
time.

There may be more elegant ways of doing this, but I was too lazy.

We recently installed PC-Pine 3.90 for the users on our Novell LAN.  We 
use the LanWorkgroup 4.2 TCP/IP stack.  We are having an intermittent 
problem with Pine suddenly aborting and exiting to DOS, displaying the
message:

   Bug in Pine detected: "Bad msgno in mail_fetchtext"  
   Exiting Pine.

It will most often do this when attempting to save a message to a folder, 
but has also happened when a user simply tries to delete a message, 
forward a message, or even read a message from the inbox list.

I at first thought it might be an incorrect imap version problem, so I 
downloaded imapd-bin.solaris from ftp.cac.washington.edu, then installed 
it on our Sparc5 mail/domain server (yes, I did a "kill -1 <pid>" to 
restart the daemon...I know some of you will ask).

This didn't solve the problem.

The curious thing about this problem is that it surfaces intermittently, 
and happens to different users at different times.  It might work fine 
for a week or so, with the user saving and deleting files at will, with 
no problems at all, then one day start acting up.  So, 90% of the time 
Pine works flawlessly, it's just that 10% that becomes very annoying, 
because it kicks you out without warning.  When this happens, Pine of 
course generates 4 or 5 debug files.

Has anybody experienced a similar problem?  I've followed the messages on 
this list for several weeks without spotting any problems that sound similar.
I've also looked through the the tech-notes, FAQ, and even the August 
mail list archive, and found no hints or reports of similar problems.

Advice, anyone?

The suggestions for new headers came from me (an avid news and mail user 
who years ago designed a newsreader that was never developed) so it's not 
so much that Pine cares about these things, it's that I care and I thought
others might too....

For the sake of discussion suppose the headers are called:
  X-Posted-To: 
  X-Response-To-Message-In: 

And suppose I receive a message with these headers (plus some other
headers) in my mailbox:
  From: abrahamp
  To: nancym
  Cc: peterg
  Subject: Re: How Experiments End
  Newsgroups: soc.history.science
  X-Posted-To: soc.history.science
  X-Response-To-Message-In: soc.history.science,sci.philosophy.tech

Because of the X-Posted-To: header I know that abrahamp both posted and 
mailed his message so it is ok (acceptable netiquette) for me to both 
mail and post my response.  Because of the X-Response-To-Message-In:
header I know that he is responding to a message that was crossposted
to soc.history.science and sci.philosophy.tech so I can go take a look
at both these newsgroups to read the discussion.  Since crossposted
discussions often bifurcate its useful to know all the newsgroups
the message that's being replied to was in.  

Does this seem useful to anyone else?

Also, I'm curious which other mailers allow users to simultaneously mail
and post.

Thanks much,
Nancy

PS to people reading this on the header-people mailing list (which is 
linked to comp.mail.headers): If possible could you post your response 
to all the newsgroups that are participating in this discussion. Thanks.

If you get a connection with telnet news nntp, your nntp-server is
called news.  If it isn't you can look at the headers of your own
postings for clues or ask your news administrator.

Your nearest NNTP server seems to be spool.cs.wisc.edu.

I just tested TRN 3.5, TIN 1.2 PL2, NN 6.4.18, and PINE 3.90 by using
the r command to respond in mail to a USENET article.  TRN, TIN, and NN 
all included a Newsgroups: header in a mailed response to a news article.
Pine 3.90 did not include a Newsgroups: header when the response was
mailed only.  Do you really think that TRN, TIN, and NN are brain damaged?

It seems clear that if there is going to be a standard header that means
that a mail message was simultaneously mailed and posted it will have
to be something other than the Newsgroups: header.  What do people think
of Posted-To:?

Thanks,
Nancy

mail list archive, and found no hints or reports of similar problems.

Advice, anyone?

I'm still loving 3.90, although I can't access newsgroups. Here is what I 
get:

When booting system (DG/UX 5.4.201):
  
  Oct 1 18:05:50 faxon inetd[3505]: bad configuration line

inetd.conf file (relevant lines only):

#
# IMAP (Pine) server configuration
#
pop	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/etc/ipop2d	ipop2d
pop3	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/etc/ipop3d	ipop3d
imap	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/etc/imapd	imapd

Did I miss something somewhere? When I do try to access news 
(news.cac.washington.edu) I _can_ see the groups, but I can't subscribe 
to them. Any help would be appreciated. TIA

Dion

I disagree, I'd call rn's reply behavior ignorant of RFC 1036.

I have had one person get mad at me once: I mailed him a copy of my
followup on his posting and he replied privately.  Later he saw that I
had also posted my message so he had to go back into his archive and
manually post the answer he had sent to me.  Consequently I renamed
Newsgroups: to Also-Posted-To: for a while.  The Also- prefix was
inspired by the son-of-rfc1036 draft.  Now that I've seen Pine use
Newsgroups: as an indicator for postings I've returned to sending out
that header.  Sam Tardieu uses To-Newsgroups.

Instead of reading minds, one could of course query the NNTP server
for the message-id, but postings may not arrive there soon enough.

> If you received the message by mail, and there is no indication that

> You do not need any special headers for that.

If you want to automatize things, you need a standardized label which
indicates a public posting.  The same problem arises for newsgroup
moderators who have to decide whether a message con Newsgroups: was
meant as a private reply or a public submission.

> Usually the "Received:" header in mail and the "Path:" header in
> usenet news can give you this information.

Many mailers and newsreaders consider Path: and Received: clutter
and do not include it in forwarded messages.  Anyway, these lines
tell you how the message made it to you, not where it originated.

I've been using Old-Newsgroups: and Old-To: to indicate the origin of
a conversation occasionally, that prefix was inspired by formail.

> "Newsgroups:" has a defined meaning for usenet, but has no defined
> meaning for email.

You also believe that Content-Type: is undefined in news just because
RFC 1521 doesn't mention Usenet?

> But you will probably never get it adopted.  There are too many
> existing products which do not honor these to-be-invented headers

Yes, unfortunately Newsgroups in replies has become very common
and Pine3.90 alone does not produce enough pressure on people who
want to keep their replies private to fix their newsreaders.

i get the same pine-debug files. four of them build up and then they stop 
(i don't know f they are rewriting to those four or not - haven't 
checked). anyone know what the cause of it is?

Well, try to write danish charaters in those other mail programs
you mean are so good and send that mail from unix and read it
on a PC :-) 

Do the same with one or another kind of document made by one or
another programme.

Then after that please tell me which of your mail programs I can
get for free and that can do the same that easy :-)

The UW folks have implemented many neat features, some a tad
overbearing, but most of them are safe and easy to use and well
documented, both for beginners and experienced users. Pine definitely
excels in this area.

However, when you look at the monstrous sources, you will find a lot
of debatable clutter making pine larger and slower than necessary and
hard to overview and maintain.  Once you need to make some adaptations
to your local environment you start to wonder why things like the path
to your news spool or the newmail poll time aren't organized in one
single config.h for all architectures or at least all flavors of Unix.

It seems to me that you are signing the message, not the attachment. So
having the .sig file after your message, but before the attachment, makes
lots of sense. Maybe we have lost/gained something by dealing so much with
electronic communications. Perhaps we can benefit from some traditional
correspondance training. I know it would help me.

You could call up your computing center on the phone and ask...  Really,
this is a local-type question which can only be answered locally.

Actually you can:

# Add these customized headers (and possible default values) when composing
customized-hdrs=Reply-To,
            Organization: SURFnet bv,
            Address: "Cluetinckborch, P.O. Box 19035, 3501 DA Utrecht, NL",

            Telefax:  +31 30 340903

By surrounding the text-with-commas with ""'s you can have commas in a
header.

Is there a way to turn off the feature that asks to move your sent-mail
and saved mail to a file called sent-mail-"month" then delete the previous
months sent-mail and saved mail.  

I just want to keep my mail in one folder and clean it myself.  I also do
want to be asked these questions when I really want to quickly get in and
read my mail.

Can anyone tell me if there is a way to remove unread messages from view 
at one time.  Deleting messages one-by-one is time consuming and I have a 
number of lists where I simply scan the headers and look at only one or 
two items.  Please reply to my email address.

Pine is clearly doing (more or less) the "Right Thing" here. 

Once a message has been moved - from either INBOX (mail) or 
from the news spool or nntp-server into another folder, all 
a mail/news-reader has to go on is what's in the header. 

The scheme Neil Rickert suggest would break under these conditions. 
( When I get replies on a query I've posted, I usually save them,
 whether they were posted replies or mail replies into a topic
 specific folder. I don't want to have to switch back and forth 
 between folders when I'm working on a summary or other replies. )
How can a program tell if it was a posted or e-mailed reply, other
than trying to infer from the headers?  

Inference isn't perfect, so it does have to ask for confirmation - 
and maybe that message could be made more clear. 

I'm not sure what it does to outgoing Newsgroups: header lines 
in all cases. I think it ought to propagate this info, even if
the user doesn't post his reply. However, this will obviously
make any inference even less likely to be true. 

Perhaps there does need to be some new header or convention defined. 

My newsreaders also allow a Cc: address, and they will mail AND 
post a reply if that is filled in. If I'm posting a reply to someone,
I often CC: them personally as a courtesy. I always appreciate it
when someone does the same - I don't always follow news every day, 
even if I've posted a message, so getting an email-reply of a message
that is also posted is quite helpful. But, I have also gotten remarks
from folks who don't like this double-reply. They always assume if 
they get a response in the mail, that it is a non-public response, 
and they reply by email; then get anoyed when they see also see my
message show up in news. There is really no consensus about proper 
e-mail ettiquite is this matter - so maybe there needs to be a better
convention for indicating all these cases clearly. ( and note that
this is another case that "breaks" Neil Rickert's scheme. )

If they leave Newsgroups: headers in mail they generate, yes. They are
inserting undefined headers.

No more so than any other public domain software.  In my experience, Pine
was one of the easier packages to install that wasn't developed specifically
for my type of system.  Having to redefine the compiler type does not
seem to me to be a major effort, especially bearing in mind some of the
far more serious problems I have encountered with other packages; doing
some minor tweaking to the makefiles is no big thing when you
consider the amount of work that has gone into a program of this scale
which is then freely distributed!

Not a problem on demand-paged systems such as Unix and VMS, which are
the most common platforms for Pine.  Your claim that the help information
must be loaded into memory whenever the software is used is incorrect.

I haven't noticed it trying to open the default mailbox if I specify an
alternative on the command line.  As for changing the status of new messages
to unread, every mailer I have used does this (correctly in my opinion).

These are your opinions.  Whilst you are entitled to them, please
don't use them as reasons to substantiate your claim that the software
is "junk".  My opinion (which is independant, I have no connection with
the Pine development team) is that Pine 3.90 is by far the best character-
cell based mailing system available for Unix platforms that I have used,
combining a large number of powerful features with an easy to use and
pleasant user interface.  And it's free.
Cheers,

Chris.

Message-Id: <3741ec$7pr@news-4.nss.udel.edu>

I haven't tried digging through the code yet, but I think I've
identified a problem with Pine and IMAP.  From what I can tell,
it is Pine that supplies the full pathname of the INBOX when Pine
is using the IMAP service

This can be a real problem if (as I am) you are dealing with several
different operating systems that happen to *NOT* agree on where the
users' INBOX is stored

	SunOS-4.1.3	/var/spool/mail
	Solaris-2.X	/var/mail
	IRIX-5.x	/usr/var/mail

This list is not complete, other systems put things in places other than 
those listed above.

I discovered this problem while testing the Solaris version of IMAP with
a SunOS Pine client.  Pine kept telling me that my mailbox was empty until
I created a symbolic link on the Solaris system from /var/spool/mail 
to /var/mail.

I don't think the client (i.e. Pine) should be telling the server (IMAP)
where to look for the users' INBOX.

Subject: Need help with Pine-Eudora interaction!!
Date: 7 Oct 94 17:37:02 GMT
Message-Id: <mcdowelt.781551422@rintintin.Colorado.EDU>

Hi:	
	My boss reads his mail using Pine, and leaves it in the in box.  Later Iam expected to come into the same account using Eudora and bring the mail up unto my laptop for printing.  The trouble is it appears that Eudora picks up on
the fact that the mail was marked read by Pine, and does not download it to my 
laptop.  QUESTION:  Is there a way to configure Pine so that it does not mark
messages as read so that when I come in to the mail under Eudora I get all the
mail downloaded to me.  I'd greatly appreciate a response to my email at
mcdowelt@rintintin.colorado.edu.

				Tim

One user on our system (so far) is getting the following:

Bug in Pine detected: "Recieved abort signal"


He gets this when quitting pine every time and produces a core.pine file 
(I am on BSDI/386 v1.1)

I use pine constantly all day long and I have never encountered this..

Randy,
If, in your .pinerc or pine.conf, you use the form: 

 inbox-path={imap-host}inbox

rather than an explicit path name, then the imapd process will interpret
"inbox" in accordance with he convention for the system it was built on.

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

Subject: What is Pine?

   Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for
   reading, sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed
   specifically with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored
   to accommodate the needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses
   Internet message protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and
   runs on Unix and PCs. 
  
   The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful
   limitation of features, one-character mnemonic commands,
   always-present command menus, immediate user feedback, and high
   tolerance for user mistakes.  It is intended that Pine can be learned
   by exploration rather than reading manuals.  It has the ability to
   perform full screen editing of messages, attachments (such as Word or
   Excel files), and other advanced message system features. 

   Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and
   MIME for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to
   normal messages. 

   
------------ 
Content-Description: What is MIME?

Subject: What is MIME?

   MIME (RFC 1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It
   is an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
   (word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between
   any compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME
   from the RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
   comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list
   that is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime and comp.answers. 
   
------------
Content-Description: What is IMAP?

Subject: What is IMAP?

   IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client
   program on any platform at any location on the Internet can access
   email folders on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be
   local, they reside on the server until the client explicitly moves or
   deletes them.  The IMAP protocol is a functional (but incompatible)
   superset of POP. A principal advantage of IMAP over POP is that it
   permits using more than one computer to access your mail.  Using
   multiple computers with POP typically results in your mail ending up
   scattered across all of those computers. Another key advantage is
   IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages, e.g. you
   don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved until
   you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
   dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see
   the paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP
   vs. POP."
  
   IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email
   on a remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or
   departmental).  There is an IETF working group currently defining the
   IMAP4 revision to the IMAP2 specification (RFC-1176).  A copy of the
   latest IMAP draft may be obtained from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
   file imap/latest-imap-draft

------------ 
Content-Description: How can I get a copy of Pine?

Subject: How can I get a copy of Pine?

   Pine is available via anonymous ftp from the pine directory of
   ftp.cac.washington.edu. See the Installation Instructions for Pine for
   more information. 
   
------------
Content-Description: Is there a manual?

Subject: Is there a manual?

   The Pine program itself includes extensive online help.  Additional
   documentation may be found via anonymous FTP or via World-Wide-Web
   using the following URLs: 

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

   The Pine program itself also includes extensive online help. Other
   forms of access are planned for the future. 
   
------------
Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

   The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is
   bi-directionally gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described
   below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.
          
          For official announcements only, you may wish to see
          pine-announce instead of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
          

        subscribe pine-info

   in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu. 
          
   Pine-Announce@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Announce is a announcement list for the email program
          Pine. When new Pine products are released and old ones updated,
          a message goes out to this group describing the development. It
          is a very low volume list and includes no discussion
          whatsoever.
          
          _All messages to this list are automatically forwarded to
          pine-info, so it is not necessary to subscribe to both lists._
          
          To subscribe to pine-announce, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
          

        subscribe pine-announce

   in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-announce@cac.washington.edu.
          
   IMAP@CAC.Washington.EDU 
          This is the official mailing list for the IETF IMAP working
          group and other interested parties. Discussion of the evolving
          IMAP standard and related issues is conducted on this list.
          
          To subscribe to IMAP, send a message to
          imap-request@cac.washington.edu.
          
   C-Client@CAC.Washington.EDU 
          This list is for discussion of the C-Client library which is
          used by Pine and various other mail and IMAP clients and
          servers.

Subject: What are all these funny names in your examples?


   In an attempt to avoid confusion with real places or services we
   decided to make up a ficticious user for our examples. This person is
   John Smith, who is currently an art major at the University of Nowhere
   (nowhere.edu). He previously attended Elsewhere Community College
   (elsewhere.edu). His username is jsmith and he uses the following
   machines: 
   
   rembrandt.art.nowhere.edu 
          A Unix timesharing machine. 
          
   picasso.art.nowhere.edu 
          An SMTP server. 
          
   news.nowhere.edu 
          A Usenet News server which supports both NNTP and IMAP access. 
          
   davinci.art.nowhere.edu 
          A PC-compatible workstation running MS-DOS. 
          
   warhol.art.nowhere.edu 
          An IMAP server. 
          
   fozzie.elsewhere.edu 
          An IMAP server at Elsewhere Community College.

Subject: How many sites use Pine?

                                       

   We don't have a good way to count the number of sites running Pine,
   but at last count over 4,000 sites in 40 countries had downloaded the
   Pine 3.89 distribution from ftp.cac.washington.edu. There are also
   several major archive sites that mirror the distribution, so the
   actual numbers are probably much higher.

Subject: I have found a bug in Pine 3.05. Could you please fix it?

                                       

   When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
   possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point
   that a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't
   reproduce the problem in the current version, our standard response
   will be to ask you to upgrade.

Content-Description: If I postpone a Reply, there is no 'A' in the index after I resume and send it.

Subject: If I postpone a Reply, there is no 'A' in the index after I resume and send it.

                                       

   This is a known limitation of the current release of pine. When you
   postpone a composition, Pine does not have any way to keep track of
   which message was being replied to (or that it was a reply at all).
   This limitation will be removed in a future release of Pine.

   The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"
   means that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in
   which it expected a start-of-message header line, it found something
   else.
   
   The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
   All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine.
   
   Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
   itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the
   problem go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the
   folder and see what is wrong with the very first line. In particular,
   make sure that there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file
   and that the first character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' ,
   the second an ``r'', the third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an 
   INBOX, you may want to rename the folder so that new mail can be
   delivered while repairs on the corrupt folder are being done. 
   
   Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g.
   /bin/mail) which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the
   beginning of the new data.
   
   Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail
   folder without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This
   is a general problem on UNIX. 
   
   Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
   folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
   system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
   attribute caching.
   
   Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3).
   If the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to
   determine its cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some
   external software. The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2)
   and (3) is that it does not want to risk damaging user data by
   guessing what is right. Pine never writes to the folder unless it is
   absolutely sure it knows what it is doing.
   
   There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
   conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance
   of your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and
   installed Pine on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

   Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
   occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the
   file at the same time.
   
   Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
   UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity.
   
   There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
   There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
   On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call
   it used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of
   lock file as well, but this has not been directly verified.
   
   _NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
   basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
   systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are
   known problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an
   application beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it).
   All of the above mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

   This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With
   the default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will
   get full access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be
   changed to read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not
   see any further updates to that folder until it is reopened with full
   access. Currently the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and
   restarting Pine. With the Tenex format, any number of sessions can
   simultaneously have full access to a folder, with the exception that
   expunging is disabled. See "What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I
   use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

   The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine
   has discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing
   your mail folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level
   lock used by programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail,
   and by certain programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly,
   this lock is only to be acquired and held for a very short period of
   time (less than a second).
   
   It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that
   message every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the
   time that it will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is
   false -- that is, that whatever program locked the folder forgot to
   unlock it (perhaps it crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the
   lock for itself.
   
   This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
   interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
   _NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting
   to open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will
   trigger this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters
   or less on those systems._

Subject: Why is a charset=US-ASCII attachment sent using BASE64 encoding?



   Pine BASE64-encodes all attachments, including text, in order to
   assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make sure
   file attachment in Pine is as dependable as FTP (and BASE64 is safer
   than Quoted-Printable). A good example of why this is handy is when we
   recently asked some folks to attach their addressbooks to help us
   track down problems in 3.90, we didn't have to worry about whether a
   gateway had modified a tab or trailing blanks, etc, etc.

   Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind
   carbon copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as
   you compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other
   people's INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in
   the default Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich
   headers command (Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose
   it.

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

                                       

   Here are a couple ways to use Ispell within Pine: 
    1. Set your alternate-editor to ispell, then ^_ in the composer
       invokes ispell. To do this set "editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell" in
       your .pinerc file. This may be set within Pine via the _OPTIONS_
       task of the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.
       
       Now, when you press ^_ (Control-Underscore) in Pine, you will
       execute the ispell program in its native mode. Press ? for help.
       Press I to insert unknown words into the personal dictionary. You
       can still press Ctrl-T to use the standard pine spell-checking
       program (which will -not- use your personal dictionary). See 'man
       ispell' for more information on the ispell program.
       
    2. Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable so you can
       create the following script and name it spell. 
       

     #!/bin/sh
     ispell -l | sort | uniq 

   To make Ctrl-T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words'
       dictionary: 
          + make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory 
          + make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell' 
          + set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL
            $HOME/spell' (you may include this command in your .profile,
            .cshrc or .login file) 
   
       
       Now, when you press Ctrl-T in Pine, you will execute the ispell
       program, and it will recognize words stored in the private
       dictionary. The screen display will look like pine is using the
       standard spell-checking program. Unfortunately, this method does
       not allow the user to Insert words into the private dictionary.
       However, this might be useful with a central script file (setenv
       SPELL ...) and a central private dictionary (ispell -p ...) to
       provide a common private dictionary for an entire workgroup. The
       manager could add items to the private dictionary; ordinary pine
       users would use the private dictionary (Ctrl-T), but they could
       not change it. 
       
   To use ispell with pico, implement the 'ispell' program via ^T
   (CTRL-T) (using the script file) in addition to implementing it via ^_
   (CTRL-_) (using the .pinerc file). 
     * Use Ctrl-_ in Pine (it won't work in Pico) for full-featured
       ispell. 
     * Use Ctrl-T in Pico to use the ispell program and your
       .ispell_words dictionary (but without the full ispell
       functionality). 
       
   You can use Ctrl-T/ispell in Pine also, but why bother when Ctrl-_
   works better.

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?

                                       

   Three ways to access news via Pine: 
    1. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       

        news-collections=News *[*]

   
       
    2. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]

   
       
       Alternatively, if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from the same server.
       
       
    3. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]

   
       
   The advantage of option #3 is that the same .newsrc can be used for
   both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
   account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

   Pine does not currently support this directly, but here is a
   work-around: 
    1. Move the cursor to the Cc: line. 
    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line. 
    4. Move the cursor where you want it in the body of the message. 
    5. Press Ctrl-U to insert the address. 
       
   This is kind of a round-about way to get the job done, but it works...

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

   Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
   programs, such as "procmail", or "filter" or "deliver".
   
   Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "filter"
   program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
   mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX.
   
   So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
   message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has
   created? Pine's answer is to let you specify them in your .pinerc, as
   in the example:
   
    
   
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

   In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
   program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class
   into the folder "filter/to-art151" and mail relating to the Art-L
   mailing list into "filter/to-Art-L". 
   
   From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those
   folders. Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may
   have new mail waiting for you, so that you don't "forget" that you
   have more than one place to look for new mail...

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
   Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of
   Pine. If you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients
   already, the following information may be useful. 
  
   The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
   authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication
   is designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with
   alternative authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
   This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of
   c-client you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the
   name of your port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is
   included by the os_xxx.c file.
   
   The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it
   may be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only
   contains that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify
   that file and rebuild imapd.

   No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail
   model (wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the
   local machine and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely
   that this model will be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or
   POP as the access protocol, in a future release.

Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

                                       

   Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or
   mulitple users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost*
   full Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW
   access is that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no
   one can do an Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a
   msg as deleted) *can* be done, and this state is preserved across
   sessions. 
   
   If an explicit Expunge cmd fails, it will say so and tell you that the
   mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session
   left using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again.
   
   In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW
   client at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session
   steals the RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier
   session becoming RO.

Subject: Where does Unix Pine look for configuration information?

  
                                     
   In Pine 3.90, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the Main Menu) contain
   a section on Configuration, including default file names and
   environment variables. 

   In brief, Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide
   file /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, a system-wide non-overridable file
   /usr/local/lib/pine.fixed, and a personal configuration file
   ~/.pinerc. There are certain options which are only found in system
   wide configurations, others only found in personal configurations, and
   still others found in both. For settings found in both pine.conf and
   .pinerc, values in .pinerc take precedence over those in pine.conf, 
   and settings in pine.conf.fixed take precedence over everything.
   
   If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide
   configuration files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib ". Pine
   automatically generates a .pinerc when a user starts Pine for the
   first time.
   
   Starting with Pine 3.90, almost all personal configuration can be
   accomplished through the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.

         3. A file named PINERC in the same directory as PINE.EXE 
    2. The HOME environment variable, if not set, defaults to root of the
       current working drive. 
    3. The default for external files (PINE.SIG and ADDRBOOK) is the same
       directory as the PINERC file. 
    4. The support files (PINE.HLP and PINE.NDX) are searched for in the 
       same directory as PINE.EXE. 
            
   Starting with Pine 3.90, almost all personal configuration can be
   accomplished through the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.

Subject: How do I make Pine work with my older terminal?

                                       

   Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
   well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
   others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?

                                       

   You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: How can someone without a MIME-aware mail program decipher an attachment?

                                       
   

   Regarding attachments: Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for this.
   MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) uses "Base64" encoding
   rather than uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are
   transformed by some email gateways, and there are also several
   incompatible versions of uuencode.
   
   However, you can certainly uuencode a file outside of pine, then use
   the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert the encoded
   file in the message.
   
   If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient does need to have
   MIME-capable software. Fortunately, this is not hard to find. Even the
   major proprietary mail vendors have committed to MIME support, but
   some of their upgraded products are still some months away. One
   product which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available from ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the /pub/mpack
   directory.

Subject: How do I convert a Sun Mailtool attachment to MIME format?

                                       

   A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows
   mail to MIME. Body parts currently supported are: text, gif, Sun
   rasterfile (converted to image/gif), postscript, and audio. Other
   types default to application/octet-stream. It's easy to extend the set
   of types supported and to add conversions, if necessary. 
   
   The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the
   "convert" program from ImageMagick. If you don't have ImageMagick you
   can probably substitute the pbm stuff with little fuss. 
   
   The program is available via ftp from cs.utk.edu in
   pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.perl or pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.c

   Here's a little script one of our UNIX folks worked up to handle
   conversion of elm aliases to pine alias form (pretty simple syntax
   substitution). If you execute it multiple times it will keep adding
   another set of your elm aliases to your pine addressbook.

Message-Id: <Pine.PTX.3.90.941007154421.5950E-100000@lancelot.aps.org>

Hi,

First of all, let me say I am impressed with the enhancements made coming 
from the previous version. My only problem is this: I have been trying to 
make sense of the "user-domain" and "use-only-domain-name" fields. When 
someone at host A (using Pine 3.90) receives a message from someone at 
host B (using mailx), with *no domain name* in the From: field, and then 
the person at host A tries to reply, Pine 3.90 generates the following 
address:

user@A.domain.name

In short, it seems we can't get rid of the default use of our hostname in 
replies to folks who are in our domain, but on another host. Is there a 
configuration variable or compile option I am missing here?

Thanks for your help. Because I have no direct Usenet access, I would 
appreciate a direct reply.

Fred Firestine

In TRN it is only the default $MAILHEADER format which can be changed
real easy. So chalk trn up with pine and xrn and the brain damage
prevalence drops to 50 %.

Unlike Newsgroups Posted-To has the disadvantage that most of the
currently existing integrated mail and news readers would ignore it.

I also find it more beautiful for the same information to have the
same name in news and mail.  After all, you do not have to rename
From, Subject, Date & Co. either when gating between mail and news.

The saved messages are separated by a "From " line.  News articles
have no "From " line.  Therefore Pine must create that line.  It
could easily create it in a special format which Pine recognizes as
indicating a news article.

I quickly punched a Perl program to do exactly this to please the

for me and I haven't heard any complaints from the users.

It's small, so I just appened it below. 'elm2pine' in a shar file. If it

Depends on the folder format.  The "From " separator line of course is 
not part of the message.

They may, in the same sense that mail messages do.  All of the 
newsreaders I use (rn, trn, etc) save in mbox format and have "From " 
separator lines.  You obviously prefer a different configuration.

> Therefore Pine must create that line.  

The tool that stored the message created that line. This may or may not
have been Pine.

Sorry, but there is no dependable context for making any such assumption,
especially when the same message might really have been both mailed and 
posted.  Pine gets whatever it is given, and that may be a message in any 
of a dozen different mailbox formats, created by any one of many different 
tools. As was said previously: you have only the message headers to go on.

But let's talk about *assumptions*.  A lot of this thread contains strong
criticism of Pine that is based on *assumptions* (not facts) about whether
Pine is making unwarranted *assumptions* about what to do with messages
containing a newsgroups header. 

In fact, Pine does not assume anything in this situation.
It asks the user what they want to do.  More than once.

Here's exactly what happens when I Reply to a message that contains a 
Newsgroups header:

 1. Pine prompts me with:  "Post follow-up message to news group(s)? "
    (the default is NO)
 2. If I say Yes, then it clearly shows all the newsgroups in the composer.
 3. If I then ^X to send, Pine makes sure that the headers are visible
    on the screen so I can re-check where the msg is going, then it asks 
    for confirmation... If I confirm, and there is a Newsgroups header, 
    I then get an ADDITIONAL prompt:
 4. "Posted message may go to thousands of readers. Really post?"
    (the default is NO)

Given that it is impossible to correctly *assume* the correct action in
such situations, what would you have Pine do differently?

.pine-debug files are normal.  The last one is .pine-debug1 and the oldest is
.pine-debug4.  They do come in handy when trying to track down certain
problems, so we keep them on by default....

That is only in one mailbox format, and besides, what if it is saved from
TRN?  It doesn't know this magic incantation...

Fred,
There are some rough edges in this area in 3.90.

In 3.91, if "user-domain" is set, it will be used to complete "local" or 
unqualified names.

In my mind this is the existing function of the Newsgroups header in
a mailed newsarticle (where was the discussion occurring that prompted
this message), thus your Newsgroups header could have been set to the
two newsgroups, the X-Response-To-Message-In header eliminated, and the
X-Posted-To (or Also-Posted-To would be nice) providing the information
that it is ok to reply via mail and newsgroup.

will not compile under the system(at least not so it will run).  I can
rewrite the code as a last resort, but it's been a long time since I've
programmed in unix for machine incompatibilites.  Any help would be
appreciated.

You can open the INBOX readonly with "pine -o".

Oh yeah .. a couple details:

In PathWay Access/Mail (not technically the right name for the product)
when "replying" to a message the action taken varied depending
on which folder you were in.  i.e. whether it was a News message
or Mail message.

News:	Ask whether to post followup or send mail.
	If sending mail whether to reply to everybody or just sender.
	Ask whether/how to include text in reply.

Mail:	Ask whether to reply to everybody or just sender.

Once again: This is a warnning and not a fatal error, so simply ignore it.
Instead of modifying all PINE sources and make them totally incompatible with
the original release I've decided to live with the warnnings.

Yep, I'm a real newbie, and this is a real newbie question.
I can't, for the life of me, find where the 'mark as read' command is, re: 
reading usenet news. I'd hate to have to delete everything, in case I did 
end up wanting to backtrack. Any suggestions? (e-mail preferred, as I 
don't keep up on this newsgroup.)

Thanks,

I am having the same problem.  I use crosstalk as well.  I made the

40 minutes.

Please point to a formal specification which defines "Newsgroups" with
such a meaning.  The only specification I know of defines the
"Newsgroups" header as a list of newsgroups to which the message was
posted.  Any other use of that header is a violation of that spec and
is misleading in situations where news & mail can't be distinguished.
Besides, it's obviously bad practice to have the same header have two
different meanings.

Neil,

Thanks for the thoughtful clarification; you bring up some valid points.
Specific comments such as these go a long way toward making Pine a better
product.  I'll not try to duplicate other's comments from this thread, but
to provide some word from the Pine Team on the underlying motivation for
what you found. 

It's unfortunate that your initial Pine experience was in an environment
Pine was not specifically designed to fit.  We don't actively develop
under SunOS or Solaris, but when work is done, it's based on the native
compilers.  Our goal is, of course, to keep the scripts, makefiles, and
code as portable and general as possible, but, as always, there is room
for improvement.  We will do our best, as time permits, to remedy this
situation. 

What Pine *is* designed to be is as equally non-threatening to *both* the
neophyte user and the neophyte system administrator.  With the latter in
mind, it is deemed more useful to group configuration data requiring local
modification, both OS-dependent and not, in a single location rather than
require an unfamiliar sys-admin to scan several files before becoming
confident (OK, semi-confident) that Pine will behave in a desired way.  We
hold that the sophisticated sys-admin in a heterogenous environment
already has the tools to deal with this case. 

Of course, it's clear we've not completely tackled the single-config
challenge, as there are pieces of the Pine puzzle that were initially and
continue to be developed independent of Pine.  Likewise, with this goal in
mind, it isn't clear to us that the problems self-configuring tools can
introduce offset their usefulness in our situation.  Thus, this avenue was
also not taken. 

Furthermore, we feel ease of configuration should extend to installation
as well.  That's why Pine on Unix is obese.  The fewer auxiliary files an
unfamiliar sys-admin is required to position in just the right place the
better.  This is key during both the initial installation and subsequent
upgrades.  Another reason is that we distribute pre-compiled copies of
each release.  A single binary is much simpler to fetch and install than a
tar'd package of several files to, in turn, get deposited throughout the
system. 

As for your other points, I'll concede that, for a seasoned, knowledgeable
user, some of Pine's behavior may seem less than efficient.  However, very
few user interface decisions are considered outside the context of the
fundamentals we see as requisite of a tool intended for the novice user. 
In short, this means fewer commands, more prompts, more verbose feedback,
and more menus than you might see in a tool targeted at users interested
in or familiar with the computing-end of electronic communication. 

I'm not saying Pine's completely achieved it's ease of use goals.  There
are certainly some rough edges due to poor decisions early in development,
underlying technological limits and such, but we're always trying to
improve.  That said, thank's again for your comments, and if you have any
other specific concerns, please feel free to make them known to the Pine
Team <pine@cac.washington.edu>. 

And now back to preparing for 3.91...  (due RSN)

This is an advantage. It will prevent some "helpful" intermediate mailer
from redirecting a message someplace it wasn't wanted. Using current
systems, it is quite common for "Newsgroups:" to appear in a header of
something intended for mail only. It would be a violation of ethics for
a "helpful" intermediate mailer to take the existance of that header as
meaning "post this to the newsgroups listed."

It doesn't mean the same thing, it should be named differently.

Those mean the same thing.

That is plain wrong.

The "Newsgroups:" header is defined for news in RFC1036.  The use of
"Newsgroups" in email is not a violation of RFC1036.  It cannot be a
violation of RFC1036, since that document does not apply to mail.

The definition of headers for mail is given in RFC882.  The use of
"Newsgroups:" in an email message, for any reason at all, does not
contradict or violate anything in RFC882.

It has become common practice to use "Newsgroups:" as an email header
in replies to news articles.  If we were to disallow the development
of common practice and insist that no technological innovation occur
until after the RFC has been approved, we would probably still be
back in the dark ages.

>Besides, it's obviously bad practice to have the same header have two
>different meanings.

As commonly used, the "Newsgroups:" header has only one
context-sensitive meaning.  That meaning is:

	when used for usenet postings, it lists the groups to which
	the message is posted; when used in email, it lists the
	usenet groups in which the discussion originated.

My $.02.  I for one agree with Chris.  Of course if Mr. Rickert can write
a better mail package and provide on-going enhancements and support free
of charge I'm sure that everyone would be happy to move over to it.

Subject: bug in pine: "Append Validity Error" - PC-NFS 5.0
Content-Length: 798

I'm having the above message with PC-NFS5.0 when trying to compose
a message.  It happens always when trying to write the FCC.  I've
fooled around with the FCC options, and have figured out a way
to send mail, although it's a real hack.. You have to change the
FCC in setup from default to by-user.. and then when you compose,
when the fcc field pops-up after you enter the To: field, delete
everything in the FCC field.. then the message will send..

  Also, if there is already a sentmail folder (file).. pine will say
sentmail folder does not exist, create it? And if you answer yes
it will say, "sentmail already exists, permission denied".
Seems kind of funny to contradict itself like that..

 Any clues?

Message-Id: <3798vm$577@gulfa.ods.gulfnet.kw>

  Greetings,
          I'm trying to compile pine3.90, the platform is an SCO V/386 3.2.
Every thing runs fine, pico is nicely built, the problem is in pine. When
using gcc first, many errors occured in a file/function called memmove2.c,
with cc only a warning is shown and it runs till it reaches "mtest.c" which
requiers an encryption library (~/crypt/libcrypt.a). unfortunately removing
the " -lcrypt " from the makefiles does not solve the problem, which is: This
library is not available. Even in most sites which hold GNU releases, the 
file "gclib-crypt.tar.gz" does not hold that library. If anybody knows an 
equivilent or any way to get over this problem, help is really needed.

Thank You & Best Regards.
Abdalla.

Hi,

	Instead of 'No more news groups.  Return to "inbox"?' when one has
tabbed through all news groups, how about 'No more news groups.  Return to
"inbox" or start again?' I find that as soon as I've finished reading all
the news in my subscribed groups, then there is usually new news to be
read, and I would like to be able to go back to the first group in the
list and go through them all again if I want to, otherwise go back to
"inbox". (I usually read news starting at the first subscribed group,
reading or deleting everything here, and then moving onto the next.)

	--Simon.

Doug -

There is bad news, mediocre news, and good news.

The bad news is that this is a known bug in Winsock Pine 3.90.  It occurs
if your timezone is set to anything other than PST8PDT (the Microsoft
default and also where we are located).  As I heard it described, it was 
sampling the current time at two different points and calculating a 
delta, but one of those samples was in Pacific time instead of local 
time.  This caused the delta to be a matter of hours rather than seconds, 
and that delta in turn was used as part of a calculation for a wait time.  
Oops.

This problem is specific to Winsock.  PC Pine does not have this problem, 
nor does Unix Pine.  Apparently, you have to be really careful where your 
tzset() calls are on Winsock applications.

The mediocre news is that you can work around this problem by leaving 
your timezone unset or set to PST8PDT.  Welcome to the west coast!  ;-)

The good news is that this bug is fixed in Pine 3.91, which should be 
coming out imminently.

When going into "Compose" a message keeps appearing as follows:  "continue
interrupted composition (answering 'n' won't erase it)"?  However there is no
interupted composition.

Does anyone know how to get rid of this message?  Thanks if you can help.

Hi, all.. I know this is a stupid question, so a quick stupid answer
will be appreciated.  I'm fresh into using Pine now for newsgroups,
I used to use tin..  Tin always used to tell me how many 'responses' there
were on the string of the original poster.  I cant' redily tell in pine..
I see certain post subjects are listed by themselves, such as 'subject X'
and others will say 'Re:  SUbject X', are all the 'Re: '  subjects actually
responses to the first subject w/o the 'Re: ' looking backawards time-wise?
Do you understand my question??  I barely do <laugh>, what I would like
to know, is how I can tell how many 'responses' there are to a certain
post, and how to view those replies..  thanks..!

Hello everybody,
the command W searches for a string in the mail-header (if in the 
index-menu).
Question: Is there a command to search for a string WITHIN the body of 
all mails?
'elm' has the slash (/) as 'pine' has the W command. I did not find anything
in 'pine' as the command slash-slash (//) in 'elm', searching for a string
anywhere in a mail.
Can anybody help me?
Best regards,
                Urs

Assuming I have not missed something in the documentation (and if I have, 
I would appreciate knowing it!), my little suggestions would be:

1) Reduce the number of keystrokes to Delete All in a group.  I think a 
lot of us scan groups for interesting subjects and read just them.  
Especially with the recent growth in number of postings, this would be 
an *exceedingly* desirable amendment.  
   An easy way to implement would be to add a toggle ";" to the Select 
sub-screen -- hence ; ; would be Select All-Deleted.

2) Implement a Kill/Select file.  Probably emulating the kinds of options 
permitted on (for example) nn would be fine.  

3) Permit a default Sort option such that one does not have to choose $ 
repeatedly.

4) Add a Line-Count to the titles.  Again, this is helpful in scanning.

Dave,
who did NOT think he would like the pine reader, but who has been
pleasantly surprised.

I'm using the linux pico binary from ftp.cac.washington.edu & get a
"a" with a umlaut (two dots) over it in the first line of the buffer.
I experienced a similar problem with an earlier version that i
compiled myself.  Any ideas?  It doesn't seem to be a wrong terminal
type & the extra character doesn't appear in the saved file.

this is one of my pine-debug files (sorry that it is so long). it looks 
like the problem occurs in the first few lines of this file. does anyone 
know why this would be happening? i checked /usr/local/lib and there are 
no pine files in it. are there supposed to be?

While I still use elm for much of my email (matter of
habit) - I was very
impressed with pine when I first came accross it
as our users obtained a user-friendly yet powerful
email program free.  And it was for our users that
pine was installed.  That must be saying something
about pine when users actually ask for it?

While there are now rivals to pine (can anyone name
a previous/present UNIX rival to pine?) examples of 
really good design are :-

---  The user-friendly and very powerful address book - including
creating lists.

---  For the  UNIX version - printing to a local PC or MAC printer.

---  Prompting and explanations of what the user is about
to do and error tolerant.

---  For UNIX - very easy and painless to compile - even on a 99% SUN
compatable Solbourne computer.

---  Availability of UNIX executables to save the hassle of
compiling.

---  Simple to use default editor.

---  For UNIX - stand alone binaries for simple installation.

---  Easy mailing and extracting of binary files.

---  For UNIX version - Nice file find and selecting procedure.

---  Easy access in latest version of pine for "power?" users.

------------------

The main part that confuses new users is :-

       I     FOLDER INDEX       -  View messages in current folder

       L     FOLDER LIST        -  Select a folder to view

but this is relatively easy to show how to use.

-------------------

While we use the latest version of pine for UNIX - we are
unsure about the MS-Windows version.  Mainly because
we would  like it to be transparently usable from any PC or 
telnet session for a user.  Because of the requirement
that the .sig and .address book have to be located
locally - this isn't easy for WinPine.

The easiest way to presently make it transparent for users
irrespective of what PC/MAC or terminal they are using
is to log into the email server via a telnet session and run
pine.

Uh, there are no ``From '' lines separating the messages in my mailbox. 
You must be thinking about a mailbox format that is used on some other 
system.

I've had trouble getting pine to use a wyse and wyse50 terminal properly.
I've looked through the technical notes and documentation and haven't found
any references to this problem.

I'm having the problem on suns running sunos 4.1.3 (haven't tried our other

Anyone have any ideas on what might be causing this?  Possibly a problem in
the sunos termcap?

Subject: saved-message rules
Message-Id: <1994Oct9.234213.10665@Princeton.EDU>
Date: Sun, 9 Oct 1994 23:42:13 GMT

i have searched through the manual but i can't find this feature. so i 
was wondering if anyone could help me out with this.

i know that you can set the rules so that the default save for a 
particular message will be the address of the person who sent it.

for example: i recieve a message from jwwhite@phoenix.princeton.edu
i could set the rules so that the default save would be 'jwwhite'.



now the question: is there a way that i can change the rules so that the 
default save will be some user specified name for a particular address.

for example: i recieve a message from jwwhite@phoenix.princeton.edu
i would be able to set the rules so that the default would be 'jason', or 
any other name that i choose.

this feature would be nice because one could set the default saves to the 
first names (or something) of people they regularly get mail from. it 
would eliminate having folders called '11044XB' if someone has a weird 
address on an old vax or something.

thanks,

adam

Date: Mon, 10 Oct 1994 03:52:36 GMT
Message-Id: <CxFurp.IBr@crash.cts.com>

I was using PINE 3.89 successfully over dial-up (Telebit Qblazer), and
also through dial up to a Netblazer (not a PPP connection; dial-up).

Now I try 3.90, and as soon as I try to open a mail folder, I get a
continuous stream of "^S" and "^Q"'s.

I looked at the debug file; it says something like this:

Main
Folders
"Want to read: ^S(19)
Want to read: ^Q(17)"

for about 200 lines.

Any idea what the problems is?

Thanks.

There is no specification of what the header means in mail, so your
interpretation is no more valid than mine.  However, mine is based on
the current use of at least 4 newsreaders, and thus is a better choice
than yours because I don't have to fight all that installed inertia.

	rm mail/interrupted-mail

	Only in Pine 3.90, not in 3.89, though. In 3.90, do "; t a <string>" 
and Pine will highlight all messages containing <string>.

	Well, if you're using Pine 3.90, you can hit "; t s <subject> z" and
Pine will select all the posts with the subject you're after (the "; t s
<subject>" part), and then zoom in so that you see only those posts in the
index (the "z"). Use "z" again to zoom back out to the full list of posts.

 Dear Piners !

 I am thinking  about writing thing  like tkpine, a  Tcl/Tk version of
pine for X Windows (well, tcl/tk is available also on Ms-Windows and I
think will be available on any windows you will think about, in future
of course).  What  I need is  a  kind of  libpine.a with internal pine
procedures like: "show list  of mails  in folder  (with offset in file
?)", "show one mail from folder", "send mail text with header", "check
header, expand nick names, ...  (this on sending mail)", "show address
book", "change address book", .......

 I wonder what do you think about that kind of idea and is it possible
that some   one   who knows pine   source would   help with   creating
"libpine.a" ? Or   may be such  lib is  already available  ? Any other
ideas :-) ?

 Best regards,
 Wojtek Bogusz

My admin told me that he had to take down the latest version of Pine because
it seemed to have a memory leak in it.  Is this true or did he have it setup 
wrong?  He said that it was taking up like 10 times as much memory as the old
version did when 5 people were using it at once.

Hi,

You can try ftp to qiclab.scn.rain.com. Remember, there are a number of 
different platforms available so choose the right one. Hope this helps.

I often want to check over my composition one last time before sending it 
off into cyberspace.  Pine is good to me in that it prompts me one last 
time when I go ^X.

But if I answer "no" to the question "Send mail?", my cursor is returned 
to the point in the file where I was when I hit ^X (even though Pine 
politely presented the headers to me to confirm when I thought I was 
ready to send the thing off).

I think it would be even nicer if Pine dropped me off on line 1 at that 
point, so I could scroll through one last time.  I recognize that if I 
/wanted/ to get back to where I'd been (if, for example, I'd hit ^X 
entirely by mistake) then it would be more difficult to do than typing 

N ^W ^Y 

in answer to the "Send mail?" query (which gets me to line 1 with 
a couple of screen-refreshes thrown in for entertainment).  But the 
mistake branch feels less travelled to me than the other.

So.... an enhancement request (or thought) for future versions.

We've removed all the long identifiers from the 3.91 sources so the 
warnings should be gone.

   An attractive feature of Pine is its ability to print to a printer
attached to a local system connected by modem.  Pine on a Unix machine
has no trouble printing to my IBM PC printer.  I can't print to my Mac,
however.  I have an LC III with ZTerm v1b02 as my terminal program, and
an ImageWriter connected to my printer port.  When I try to print a mail
file from Pine, the message prints to my Mac screen intead of the printer.
Has anyone succeeded in printing to a Mac?

Hi. We have PINE 3.89 under BSDI BSD/386 1.1. We switched one of our machines
from MMDF mailer to sendmail. When users attempted to access mail, ELM said
folder was 'corrupt' and PINE said that spooled mail is not a folder. 
Once I stripped out the CTRL-A's separating messages in one of the 
mailboxes, it worked OK.

I read in the technical notes that MMDF format is supported. How do I 
access my MMDF mail without having to strip it of control characters?

Thank you for your assistance.				John

this question has probably been asked many times, so i apologize in

could you PLEASE help me in setting up 'filter' to work with pine, so 
that i may forward certain messages into other folders other than the 
inbox?  i understand that i have to config the .pinerc.  so i guess my 
real problem is excuting the 'filter' program.  do i put a command in 
the .login or .cshrc file so that it will execute upon login?  

i have read the man for filter, and the pine faq from this newsgroup, but 
i am still clueless.

	I'm assuming that you are talking about the "filter" program
that comes with the elm distribution.  If my assumption is wrong you'll
need to supply additional information.

	Now the one thing you need to know is that "filter" does not
execute at login.  It is run during the delivery process.  This is
accomplished via the use of your .forward file.  An example of the
contents of a .forward file would be:

"|/usr/local/bin/filter #egreshko "

	On deliver of a message this .forward will cause the message
to be "piped" to the program "filter" defined by the full pathname.  (If
your filter program resides in a different place you need to change the
full path.....obviously.)  The #egreshko is to make the call unique to
the system.

	There isn't any configuration necessary to .pinerc file to user
filter.  Remember....pine and filter are totally unrelated.

	I can't remember what you said the problem is you are
experiencing. Was it something about interrupted mail? If so, then this is
it. If you don't want it, then rm ~/.pine-interrupted-mail and the problem
should disappear.

This is exactly my problem. Also, the abort cancels the deletion 
function, so that on restarting Pine I find all my deleted messages still 
there, marked unread. This is a fatal and infuriating error.

Message-Id: <37cgmd$isk@Ra.MsState.Edu>

I've been using 3.90 since the day it was released and have on the whole 
been completely impressed, but I finally have one small complaint.

When mailing to large distribution lists defined in the addressbook, as 
it has been discussed here before, it is often preferable to put the 
names in the 'blind-cc' field rather than the 'to' field, to prevent your 
recipients from having to scroll through pages of headers.

However, a problem arises when doing this with a list with a specific 
'file-cc' defined in the addressbook.  Hitting ^R to get the Bcc: field 
while the To: field is still blank automatically fills in Fcc: with the 
default value (e.g., "~/Mail/Sent/SENT.pine").  Putting the list name in 
the Bcc: field, then, does *not* replace the default Fcc: with the new 
one. (say, "~/Mail/Sent/SENT.qotd").

Bcc: and Fcc: are two of my favorite features; it would be nice if they 
were more aware of each other in this instance, though.

This guide teaches Folder Management and Attachments for pine.  Although the
version used here is 3.89 there should be few differences for version close to
3.89.

		What is a folder?
		The INBOX
		Creating a folder.
		Deleting a folder.
		Renaming a folder.
		Shell manipulation of folders.
		Saving to folders.

		Viewing/Saving attachments.
		Compatibility with other mail readers.

Section 1

What is a folder?

A folder is a file stored in your mail directory (Typically ~/mail) in which 
you can store messages you wish to save.
You can have as many folders as you wish as long is they do not fill up your 
disk space.  Pine creates some folders by itself:

sent-mail : this is a folder where the mail you send is saved by default (see 
Fcc: in advanced pine).

saved-messages : this is the default folder for you to save messages to.

sent-mail-<month>-<year> : every month pine asks you if you wish to copy your 
sent-mail folder to a folder called sent-mail-<month>-<year>.  This is to 
better organize the mail you send.


The INBOX

The INBOX is a special folder that is not in your ~/mail directory.  The 
INBOX is the file that the mail spooler appends incoming mail to.  It is
 normally /var/spool/mail/<login name>.


Creating a folder.

There are two major ways to create a folder.  
The first way is to go to the folder list (L) and type 'A'.  You are then
asked for a name of a folder and that folder is added.

The second way is to enter the name of a non-existing folder when it asks you 
where you wish to save the message when you do a save-message command.  It will
then ask you if you want to create the folder and merely by pressing 'y' you 
can cause the new folder to be created.


Deleting a folder.

To delete a folder go to the folder list (L), select the folder you wish to 
delete, and type 'D'.


Renaming a folder.

To rename a folder go to the folder list (L), select the folder you wish to rename and type 'R'.  It will then ask you for a new name for the folder.


Shell manipulation of folders.

Folders are only text files and as such can be manipulated by the shell.  
Here are some common operations and how to do them with the shell:

delete folder : rm -f ~/mail/<folder>
create folder : echo ""> ~/mail/<folder>
rename folder : mv ~/mail/<old folder> ~/mail/<new name>
merge folders : 
    cat ~/mail/<folder1> ~/mail/<folder2> (etc) > ~/mail/<merged folder>

These can be done from anywhere. By changing to the directory ~/mail you can 
skip the ~/mail/ section of the above commands.


Saving to folders.

While reading a message you can type 'S' to save the current message to a 
folder.  You can also do this at the folder index screen.

When you type 'S' it asks you what folder you wish to save the message to and 
provides a default (normally saved-messages).  Here you can either enter a 
name of a folder that exists and it will save the message to that folder and 
delete it from the current folder (remember the INBOX is a folder).  You can
also type in the name of a non-existent folder and it will offer to create 
that folder for you.  It is also posable to type Control-T and use the arrow 
keys to pick a folder to save it to.



Section 2

What is an attachment?

An attachment is a file or set of files that are added to the letter in such a
way that pine does not show there contents.  This is useful if you are sending
a file that makes no sense normally:

M%  ")'2 @J\4 +^/& "])P@ X ,     >/^])RP OZ^( *2O"@ $) < !20\
M<P,, X &- 0 0!0\ **O&8 $/'O& @P4A80D#  $) D !20\<P,, X &-(@
MKH\     $ #"K8@ KX\     $ #XC0     %   70 "D)QF !#Q[Q@(,.(6$

or a file that to use you would have to remove part of it if it were the 
message body (shar files for example).


The Attchmnt: field.

The attachment field contains a command separated list of files attached and a
comment string for each file, a number and a size for each file:

<number>. <path> (<size> <B/KB>) "<comment>"[,<next file>]

Ex:
1. /u/vi/calfeld/doc/guides/pine_intermediate (1 K) "Guide to pine"

However pine has a feature that makes this unnecessary.  It is the control-J 
command and is described next.


Control-J

By pressing Control-J while in the header have the option of adding an 
attachment.  When you type Control-J it will ask you for the path of the file
to attach. If you desire you can type Control-T and use a file interface to
choose a file.  After you have chosen a file to attach it will ask you for a 
comment.  You can just press return if here if you do not wish to include a 
comment.  After the comment is entered the line will appear in your Attchmnt:
field.


Viewing/Saving attachments.

When you receive a letter that contains attachments you will see at some point 
near the beginning of the letter something like this:

[Part 2, "Comment" Text 20 lines]
[Not Shown.  Use the "V" command to view or save this part]

and in the header:

Parts/attachments:
  1 Shown   3 lines  Text
  2   OK   20 lines  Text, "Comment"
--------------------------------------

To view an attachment use the 'v' command. This will ask you wish attachment
you wish to view or save.  #1 is the message itself.  Choose which one you 
wish to process and type its number.  It will now ask you if you wish
to view the attachment (v) or save it (s).  If you choose save it will
prompt you for a file to save the attachment as.  If you choose view it
will open the Viewer which allows you to view, save, search, and print the 
attachment.

This is a step-by-step tutorial for beginners in pine.
This does not cover many advanced or uncommon features or configuration.  I am
 currently writing "Intermediate Pine",  "Advanced Pine", and "Configuring 
Pine".

Please send all comments, requests for guides, or requests to get on my mailing
list to calfeld@east.east-slc.edu

This tutorial is based on version 3.89 with default set-up.
Part 1-Composing a message:

1)type 'pine' at your prompt to load pine.  If you have a non-shell interface 
do whatever is necessary to launch pine.

2)You are now at the main menu:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "To:" field is who you want to send the message to.  For this tutorial put
your own login name in.  You will be sending a message to your self.

To      : calfeld

Pine should expand this to your full name (this is only done for people who are
on the same system as you are.)
 
To      : Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>


4) Leave the Cc: field blank.  If you were to put a address in here a copy of 
your letter would be sent to that address.

5) Leave Attchmnt: field blank as well.  This is used to attach files to a 
letter.

6) Enter a subject for your letter.  When you receive mail the mail will be 
listed with only the subject shown, you can then choose which letter you wish 
to read completely.

To      : Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>
Cc      :
Attchmnt:
Subject : Tutorial Letter

7) Now enter your message. (Pine uses the editor pico by default.  I have 
not included instructions on pico here but may in another paper)

----- Message Text -----
This is a test letter for the pine tutorial.

8) Type ^T to check the spelling of your message.

9) Type ^X to send the message.  Answer 'y' or just press return to:

Send message? [y] :

10) You should now be back at the main menu.  If you get a message that messes 
up your screen don't worry; just type ^L and all will be fine again. 

Now proceed to part 2.

Part 2-Reading a message.
1) Get to the main menu of pine.  If you are already here from part 1 quit by 
typing 'Q' and relaunch pine.

2) Type 'I' to enter the folder index:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>
To: Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>
Subject: Tutorial Letter

This is a test letter for the pine tutorial.

O OTHER CMDS V ViewAttch  N NextMsg   Spc NextPage    U Undelete    F Forward

4) You may now do many things with this letter.  You can delete (D) it if you 
have no more interest in it.  You can save it (S) if you would like to keep it.
You can export (E) it to a file.  You can reply (R) to it.  You can forward (F)
it to another person.  Or you can leave it in your inbox wasting precious disk 
space and forcing the computer to tell you that you have mail every time you 
log in.  

Two notes on replying.  On almost ALL posabilities you want to answer 'n' to a 
question of "Reply to all receipents?".  The "Include original message in 
Reply?" question if answered yes will copy the contents of the current letter 
to the letter you will be
 sending in return.

For this tutorial we will delete the message with the "D" command.

Last note: It is not a good idea to leave mail in the inbox.  Either delete it 
with 'D' or save it with 'S'.  It will ask you at some point if you wish to 
expunge deleted messages.  Answer 'y'.

Part 3-Adding an address to the address book.
1)Launch pine.

2)At the main menu press 'a'.

3)Press 'a' to add a address.

4)
New full name (last, first) :

Enter the last name and first name of the person that owns the address. This is
for your reference only.

New full name (last, first) : Alfeld, Chris

5)
Enter new nickname (one word and easy to remember) :

This is what you will type into the "To:" field to send a message to the 
address you are entering.

Enter new nickname (one word and easy to remember) : chris

6)
Enter new e-mail address :

Enter the e-mail address.

Enter new e-mail address : calfeld@east.east-slc.edu

7) If you did the one above you can now enter 'chris' into the 'To: ' field of 
any message and it will send the message to me.

8)If you wish to delete an entry: select the entry with the arrow keys or 'n' 
and 'p' and press 'd'.  If you wish to edit the entry either select it and 
press 'e' or you the arrow keys to select the part you wish to edit and press '
return'.

Part 4-Viewing old mail.
1)Enter pines main menu.

2)Press 'L' to enter the folder list:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PINE 3.89   FOLDER LIST                           Folder: INBOX  0 Messages

3)Select the folder you wish to view and press return. 

INBOX is the folder where new mail is.
sent-mail is where the messages you send are kept.
saved-messages is where messages you saved are kept.

3)You can now process the messages here just like those in the inbox.

Dear PINEers,
thanks to all of you who have sent me help and valuable information.

--> The solution to enable the ;-command was to enter the configuration
--> menu and to 'enable-aggregate...' - then it worked!

I tested it and also tried the Z(oom)-command - a BRILLIANT feature
of pine; I'm excited. Congratulation to the pine-team!
Thanks and best regards,
                           Urs

When I installed pine (actually, I used Pine-Version 3.90; you should
try to get the same and newest version) I used
  build hpp
and everything worked fine and smoothly!

I am using PINE 3.89, and want to KNOW that my messages arrive at the 
destination, not just that they have been SENT, which is what PINE? or my 
system? now tells me.  How do I do this, or is it not a PINE function?

Dear PINEers,
to my request, how to search for a string within the whole e-mail
from the index-section, I got two intersting answers:
1) use the ';' command
2) use good old 'W' command
Unfortunately both of them do not work - any help?
I would appreciate it very much!
Best regards,
                 Urs

Your comm program (Zterm) on the Mac may not support local printing.  
White Knight 11 didn't, but WK 12 does.  So does Smartcom.  I don't know 
about others.

	Your question just arrived in my mailbox.  Seems it had been sent
to pine-bugs initially.

	First, are you aware that the use of upper case on the Internet
is generally considered to be SHOUTING?  I think not.  Best to use
*asterik* if you want to place emphasis on a word.

	As to your question....there is no standard that defines the
"return receipt" on Internet mail.  (It is not a function of pine to
return a receipt.)  Some sendmail implementations will honor the
"Return-Receipt-To:" header.  However, you *must* know that the fact
that you don't get a receipt doesn't mean that your mail hasn't been
delivered.  Also, the fact that you did get a receipt *doesn't* mean
your mail was delivered.  That is because it may have passed through
a gateway that feels it has "delivered" your mail.

	The best receipt you can as for is the "hman" receipt.  To
implement this receipt add the text, "If you get this please let me
know", to the end of your message.  This also gives you the added
indication that your message was actually read.

      To answer my own question:  Pine 3.90 does not like to have blank fields 
in the address book.  It saw the blank field and assumed an end-of-file.  When I
tried to modify the address book, it truncated at the entry before the one 
containing the blank field.

       Hopefully this will help someone down the line.

Two ways...

1.  Press ESC twice and then shift-_.
2.  Edit your keyboard mapping (alt-f8) and choose any function key to

Good luck!

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 3.91.  This version is primarily a maintenance release intended to
fix many, though not all, of the bugs reported over the last month or so.
Highlighted fixes include: 

    o  Several address book bugs, including one that could destroy data.
    o  Fixed to allow viewing MESSAGE/EXTERNAL-BODY attachments.
    o  Fixed bug that caused pine-debug files to grow forever.
    o  Custom-header entries may now contain colons.
    o  If read-msg-folder is set, Pine no longer crashes.
    o  Several other bugs resulting in program crashes.
    o  Environment variable and improved list entry support in Setup/Config.
    o  Improvements in mailcap support (e.g., "needsterminal" recognized).
    o  Improvements in signal handling to prevent some loops.
    o  Improvements in user-domain processing.
    o  Several PC-Pine fixes (e.g., send hangs when TZ set, sorting).
    o  New features to better support news reading, and dialup access

Be sure to see Pine's builtin release notes ("R" on the Main Menu) for a
more detailed account of what's changed.  More general information on Pine
can be found via: 

    o  The anonymous FTP archives at ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
    o  The World-Wide-Web page at http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

Pine v3.91 is available via anonymous ftp to ftp.cac.washington.edu from
the file named "pine/pine.tar.Z".  Pre-compiled executables for various
flavors of UNIX can be found in the "pine/unix-bin" directory, and zip'd
copies of the DOS and Windows releases can be found in the "pine/pcpine"
directory. 

Our thanks to all you who have helped with bug reports and helpful
feedback!

Hello all,

Sorry about the bulk reply, but we have been inundated by bug reports and
help requests since the release of Pine 3.90.  You have all reported bugs or
problems that I believe are fixed in Pine 3.91, which was just released. 
Rather than individually reply to all of the outstanding reports with
basically the same message, I have decided to send one big message :) The
official announcement of Pine 3.91 should appear on the pine-announce and
pine-info mailing lists and the comp.mail.pine newsgroup shortly. 

Please obtain the new release from ftp.cac.washington.edu and let us know if
you have any further difficulties.  Thank you for your assistance and
patience!

	In that case, what you need is the following extremely technical
set of aliases! (In fact, being but a biologist and not a computer
scientist, these took me a fair few hours to perfect, but there we go.)
They convert from MMDF to standard UNIX mail (although you'll have to edit
them to reflect your particular system, obviously. These will only work
for me in particular on my particular system as is. Only a few minor and
very simple changes need to be made, however.) Well, I ramble. Here they
come...

Hi,

Pine 3.91 is working perfectly here on a SunOS systems network.
Compiled with gcc 2.6.0 and optimisation, debugging off.

MIME messages can be viewed now without core dumps and the speedups are
great too (I experience the same performance with imap now as I did with 
NFS).

Thanks Pine Team!



Richard.

I'd feel better if the "X-Also-Mailed-To:" and "X-Also-Posted-To:" were
mandatory for post and mail cloned messages (ie: document that this
occurred).

Hello

Minor error (at 2 places in pine.c).

When you first run 3.91 it says "your config file shows that this
is the first time you've run 3.90".

I've modified our pine.c so, hey, I'm a programmer again.

I am running Pine 3.90 on an HP 720 running HP-UX 9.01.  When I try to access 
my 3.89 addressbook, I only get a few entries of my large addressbook.  (Several
other users on our network do not have this problem.)   Has anyone else had

Could any1 tell me what exactly pine does when you subscribe to a 
newsgroup? All it has done so far is messed up my subscribe file in the 
'nn' news reader. !
What I would like is a shortcut to typing in the full name of the group 
you want to go to...and also going through pages and pages until a group 
you want to go to appears...as far as i know if I subscribe to a 
newsgroup using Pine it just takes the newsgroup off the list of availale 
groups.
Also would any1 happen to know any good nntp servers out there?
please reply by EMAIL as my internet time is severely restricted
thank you!

Hello !

I'm using pine 3.90 and i want to define a mask in 
my news-collection, because i have different news-server.

So, how can i tell pine to show me at 
newsserver A all comp* AND alt* etc groups, and by
newsserver B de* AND z*-Groups ??

E.G. How to define multiple selections in news-collections.

This doesn't work (only when using one Selection inside []):
     news-collections=News A *{news.de/nntp}[alt*, com*],
        	      News B *{news.de/nntp}[z*, de*].

Subject: Pine 3.91: Minor compile problem for D-G build
Date: 12 Oct 1994 04:05:04 -0400
Message-Id: <37g5bg$1na@hopi.dtcc.edu>

Pine 3.91 is out and fixes (almost) the utime problem that caused 3.90 to
futz up modification times on mailboxes on D-G builds.  However, the fix
requires the header file <utime.h> be included somewhere, which it isn't.

I just put #include <utime.h> in the c-client/os_d-g.c file to fix it.


The compile error is:

        cc -g -Dconst=  -DSTDPROTO=bezerkproto \
        -DRSH=\"restsh\" -DRSHPATH=\"/usr/bin/restsh\" \
         -c os_d-g.c
os_d-g.c: In function `portable_utime':
os_d-g.c:78: storage size of `times' isn't known
Fatal error in /usr/lib/gcc/cc1
Child exit status 041
*** Error code 1


Other than this, it's a clean compile on DG/UX systems and appears to work 
fine.

pine 3.91 is available from ftp.cac.washington.edu

Joerg,
Your expression syntax is a little too rich for Pine's blood.
Try:

   news-collections= "News alt" *{news.de/nntp}[alt*],
                     "News com" *{news.de/nntp}[com*],
                     "News z" *{news.de/nntp}[z*].
                     "News de" *{news.de/nntp}[de*].

I just got a VAX/VMS account and I'd like to compile PINE3.91 on it. But, 
as I can only get the compressed PINE source files at ftp sites, 
decompression tolls such as tar, compress, gunzip on unix are necessary. 
Could anybody tell me well to get it? Also, does Pine3.91 compilable on 
VAX/VMS?

Any reply will be appreciated!

I think the only issue is whether a program should put 
Newsgroups headers into mail messages when that mail message is 
not also intended to be posted to those newsgroups - i.e. as an
indicator that this (mail-only) message is in reply to a news
message that was posted to those groups. 


My opinion is NO - but that is admittedly not based on an explicit 
statement in any standard, but on "son of rfc1036" - which Henry Spencer 
never got around to issuing as an RFC, but which clears up a lot of 
ambiguities of rfc1036, rfc822 and the intent of mail and news messages to 
be compatible. It is more explicit about both the semantics of 
Newsgroups:  - that it "specifies which newsgroup(s) the article is posted 
to".  Rfc1036 says:  "The 'Newsgroups' line specifies the newsgroup or 
newsgroups in which the message belongs."  "belongs" can certainly be 
interpreted more widely to mean somthing other than "posted" . 


But more generally, if you accept that documents premise that news and 
mail articles are supposed to be compatible message formats, then giving
"Newsgroups:" the same semantics in both contexts is the only sensible 
interpretation. 


You may not accept that premise, but I think the fact that this has 
come up is evidence that the world is starting to resemble that premise. 
Tin and Trn are taking their own steps towards unification - however 
I think they are doing it wrong. 

There *IS* a not unreasonable argument to be made that they aren't wrong. 
But I don't think, and I haven't yet seen, a reasonable argument that
what Pine does is in any way wrong.

I have access to two news collection, each at different sites.
The local collection does not allow general UseNet access.  The
other does.  I want both.  How is this possible using pine 3.90?

When I change it to one or the other, all my newsgroups get
changed to the one I change it to.  If I put both collections
in the configuration, then it only accepts the most recent
addition.

I want to be able to set options in PINE, but everytime I select
Setup and then Options it will say: No options yet

Is there something that I must do to activate the Options selection
or is it something that my synop must first do?

Anybody have an idea why Pine 3.90 would falsely report some of my 
newsgroups as being empty?  About a third of my newsgroups (all of which 
have scads of articles in them currently viewable with another newsreader 
such as tin or rn) are falsely reported as empty.  When I check my 
.newsrc file or list the current holdings in 
/usr/spool/news/comp/mail/pine, for example, I see lots of current 
article numbers, the same ones I can read with tin or rn, but pine 3.90 
tells me they are empty.  Other newsgroups, whose appearance in .newsrc 
or in the above directory listing, is indistinguishable from the 
newsgroups falsely reported as empty, are presented by pine 3.90 in a 
perfectly normal way!

Any ideas will be most gratefully welcomed!

Pine 3.91 compiles just fine on SCO systems (at least, on my Unix 
SysVr3.2v4.2).  For those of you without compilers, I have put a package 
of the various binaries and man pages for pine (pine, pico, imapd, 
ipopxd, mtest) on anonymous FTP from soils.agron.iastate.edu, with the 
name pine3.91.sco.bins.tar.gz.  It's currently in /pub/incoming, and will 
eventually wind up in /pus/sco/unix/pine.

Hi!

Have someone succeded in building pine 3.91 on a solaris 2.3
system using gcc 2.5.8?

If yes, give me a hint :-)!

Date: 12 Oct 1994 19:27:58 +0200
Message-Id: <37h6auINNsu6@tahma.cs.hut.fi>

Could someone please enlighten me on what is the use of being able to
have multiple incoming mailboxes (INBOXes)?

At the moment I have 6 email addresses.  5 of them have been forwarded
to one single place using the sendmail ~/.forward file.

If I have understood correctly, with Pine I could trash the .forward
file and read all my 6 incoming folders directly using IMAP servers.

But what do I gain from the change?  I can understand that if e.g. I
would be reading my university mailbox from my work, it would be nice
to be able to respond to the messages so that the sender would be my
university account, instead of my corporate account.  And vice versa.
However, I don't think Pine can do such a thing.

I'm just asking because I always like to take full advantage of all
the features of the programs I work with: so why should I use multiple 
INBOXes?

Hello everyone!

I am using Pine 3.85 which I have found to be VERY helpful...Except for 
one minor detail...I understand that Pine prompts the user at the 
beginning of every month about the moving of folders, but currently I 
have so much mail in my many folders that it literally takes several hours..
I remember that after a  certain day everything is automatically saved & 
moved over...This happened last month, but I forget the day now...I am 
eager to start using my PINE folders again...Does anyone know the default 
date??

	If someone can help me I would greatly appreciate it...

		e-mail is fine, as I can read it through the UNIX mail 
command...

					Thank you for your time,

We use Wyse60 terminals capable of emulating a VT100/Wyse75 terminal.  I think 
that Simon is right in saying that PINE doesn't support terminals with the 
attributes that "normal" Wyse 50 terminals have.  

We had to completely reconfigure our terminals here so that all our 
applications running off our Sparc 10 (running 4.1.3) would also emulate the 
Wyse75 terminal which is nothing more than a VT100 terminal that gives a few 
plusses with function key and keypad emulation.

Since we've had PINE installed on our system though since version 3.04, I 
haven't looked to see if the support has been expanded to include the Wyse 
native terminal, I have a feeling it might not even now ...

The most likely cause of your trouble is that the Wyse50 "highlighting"
commands actually take up a character position on the screen, so the
following text is shifted right by one space.  Pine doesn't realize
that this is happening, so when it redraws the screen, it may put text
in the wrong place.

There *is* a workaround for this.  You can edit the termcap file --
tell Pine to use "set write-protect" instead of "set display attribute"
when it wants to highlight.   Write-protect, unlike the other
attributes, does not take up a character position.

Here's what you need to change in the termcap file.  (Some of this is
from memory, so I may be slightly off).

    1. Change the :so=\EG4: attribute to :so=\E):

    2. Change the :se=\EG0: attribute to :se=\E(:

    3. Change the :sg#1: attribute to :sg#0:

    4. On the terminal's set-up menu, indicate that write-protected
       characters should be displayed as "inverse-video" (instead of the
       factory-default setting of "half-intensity").

This fix also works for Televideo 910/925 terminals, except you may
have to skip step 4.

Greg,
It's always depressing to learn of someone who has been suffering with a 
bug that was fixed over a year ago...  If I remember correctly 3.85 got 
confused about timeouts on the beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning and 
ended up taking *forever*.

The current version of Pine is 3.91, just released yesterday.

You'll find that later versions move through the pruning prompts much 
more briskly, but you can also turn the feature off entirely by editing
your .pinerc and setting "last-time-prune-questioned" to some date far in 
the future.

	pine 3.85 ??  How about upgrading to 3.91??

	Anyway, pine does prompt you on the 1st day of each month concerning
the deletion and movement of your "sent-mail" folder.  If you don't
wish to be prompted you can look in your .pinerc file for a line like:

last-time-prune-questioned=     (This is in 3.90.....3.85 may be different)

	and set it to a date in the future.

Message-Id: <37hc45$7ck@miasun.med.miami.edu>



Help,

	I have been tring to bring up pine for OpenVMS (v6.1 axp) for the
last couple of days. I have brought source over from both
ftp.cac.washington.edu and vms.huji.ac.il, each one of them has a
problem.

	From ftp.cac.washington it looks like the vms build files for 3.90
and 3.91 are missing as well as some of the sources from c-client.

	From vms.huji.ac.il 3.90_beta sources come up with various compile
or link problems. In the c-client section I get an unresolved on the
link for "STDPROTO",  in the pine section I get a cc-e-notcompat for the
symbol void get_windsize() in the module tty_vms.c. 

	Is there anybody out there that can help me with these issues
or is there a cleaner copy of pine the pine sources for OpenVMS (axp),
please let me know.

	Thanks in advance

As long as you have "character-set=ISO-8859-1" in the Setup/Config 
screen, Pine should display 8bit without any difficulty.

The most obvious reason to me is for those people who have addresses from 
which they can't create a .forward file. Just because a person has an 
email address, doesn't mean they have a login account.

Separating your email like this could be another reason to have multiple 
inboxes. The limitation you mention, as far as I know, is correct. The 
Pine team want to make context-sensitive Reply-to: fields part of a 
future release? :)

There is already such a library.  It is called c-client.  I think it
comes with the Pine source distribution.

This is an excerpt from the Pine tech-notes.txt:

          Not long after the Pine project  began,  The  IMAP
          author had finished writing the "c-client" library
          as an interface to IMAP and as  a  switch  between
          drivers  for  IMAP  mailboxes, Berkeley mail files
          and Tenex mail files.  In time, "c-client"  became
          a  full  messaging  API  with  support for RFC-822
          parsing, MIME parsing and decoding, SMTP and  NNTP
          drivers,  and  so  forth.  Great care was taken to
          make  the  code  writing  the  mail  files  robust
          against  disks filling up, and inter-process lock-
          ing in order to guarantee mail  file  consistency.
          It  was clear that Pine would benefit greatly from
          using the c-client to access mail storage  so  the
          original  low-level Elm code was replaced by calls
          to c-client library  routines.  Consequently  Pine
          can  write  and access a variety of different mail
          file formats and new ones can be added by creating
          a  simple driver.  In addition the c-client does a
          very careful job of doing all the RFC  822  header
          parsing  and  achieves the highest compliance with
          the RFC.

Message-Id: <1994Oct12.223353.1@molbiol.ox.ac.uk>
Date: 12 Oct 94 22:33:53 GMT

This may be a FAQ, but I was wondering if anyone using recent versions of pine 
has managed to find a workaround for the following annoyance.  When using Pine 
over VersaTerm, a character is echoed to the top right-hand corner of the 
screen each time Pine checks for new mail.  This causes my VTerm session to 
report activity if it is in the background by beeping.  In older versions of 
Pine this was a great way to be notified of new mail.  In addition, once the 
session has reported activity, it will no longer beep again until it is 
brought to the foreground.  So I have 3 sessions running Pine on separate 
machines, and the 2 that I have in the background at any given time will beep 
once within minutes of being backgrounded, and will then remain silent.

Is there any way to recompile Pine without this character-echoing, or 
otherwise disable this feature?  Please tell me there is.

-Darren

Does that mean that if I have US-ASCII, I can't see 8bit characters?  I 
have the setting for US-ASCII, but I still can read and write!  Does 
anyone know why?  I am using Ultrix 4.3 with tcsh 6.02 shell and

Well, I'm on several systems, and usually have my mail redirected to one,
but if that one goes down then all I have to do is cancel mail redirection
elsewhere and Pine's already set up to look in the other INBOXes. Also,
some (ancient) systems don't have mail redirection facilities anyway.

I have yet to get imapd 3.4 working on my SGI mail server. I first tried 
several months ago when I pulled the imapd-3.4 distribution from the ftp 
site when I was looking for a POP daemon. Now that it's part of the Pine 
distribution, I still haven't been able to get it working. I'm being 
forced to keep the pine3.89 distribution around just in case I need to 
recompile imapd.

The symptom is that I am asked for a login and password even though I am 
set up not to need them. Once I enter the correct login information, I am 
told it is incorrect and cannot access my mail. Anybody else experience 
this and have a fix?

We're using Pine on out Apple Quadra running A/UX here at VITA. 

If you dial in or telnet in, all is well, but if you connect to the 
Quadara through our Novell LAN, it appears to transpose alt-M and alt-J, 
so that you can never hit return!

Is there a fix for this? It's really a drag and no one here can figure 
out how to fix this!

Please email me with your suggestions, either here

I am having problem getting Pine version 3.91.  Uncompress reports errors on
trying to decompress it, and I am not sure if it will compile on the HP 715/50.

Can anyone help??

(The executable version wouldn't work on the above system either.)

I have been told that there is an imap newsgroup, although, I have

point me in the right direction.

Basically, what I'm trying to obtain is info on how to set-up an

server to service pc workstations running Windows for Work Groups
and pine clients.

I would deeply appreciate hearing from anyone with any experience on
setting up an imap server on a Linux box.

Thanks for any help.

Help.

200 users love pine. I can't keep making individual .pinerc files for them.
Thaqy can't make their own. Until I can compile 3.91 on UnixWare, I have
to set smtp-server to localhost for them to be able to
mail from pine. Where is and in what format is the global pinerc file?

email replies to mdiehn@warren-wilson.edu and I'll summerize
here if need be.

Is there any site with useable 3.91 executables for this platform?

Subject: long - 2 bugs, Pine 3.90, fixed, 1:OSF/1 & function key only, 2:MIME
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 1994 12:19:50 -0400 (EDT)
Message-Id: <Pine.OSF.3.90a.941013121213.1513B-100000@christa.unh.edu>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The following describes 2 bugs in Pine 3.90 (and earlier in the second case)
and the output of "diff" for their fixes.

The first bug only applies to OSF/1 (as far as I know) for Pine in function 
key mode which I tend to use most of the time, since I prefer one stroke
commands to control key commands and also since the VT keyboards have a bunch
of extra keys that can be bound to some of those hidden functions in
Pine and Pico (my favorite is the set right fill column to change the
justification column, but that's another story).

Anyway, this bug appears when some function keys are used for the answers
to questions or second level command responses, such as how to apply
the selected messages.  In fact, some of the keypad keys, especially
F3 and F4 (PF3 & FP4 on VT's) get recognized by some library functions as
being "alphabetic", so their associated command doesn't get executed at all,
either beeps or has no function as a result.  NOTE again, I've only 
encounterd this on our OSF/1 machines.  The underlying fault is that the
C library query functions, tolower and isalpha have undefined results when
the value passed is not "ascii" (according to the C standard definitions of
these functions). And they recognize PF3 & PF4 as alphabetic, when of course,
they are not.  Modifying 2 lines in status.c to check first with the
builtin function isascii fixed the bug for all the cases I've found.
The diff for this fix:

# diff status.c status.c.original
665c665
<         if(isascii(ch)) ch = isupper(ch) ? tolower(ch) : ch;
---
>         ch = isupper(ch) ? tolower(ch) : ch;
668,669c668
<          && ((isascii(ch) && isalpha(ch) && !strchr("YyNn", ch)) /* y & 
n :
<                                                                    
special cas
e */
---
>          && ((isalpha(ch) && !strchr("YyNn", ch)) /* y & n : special 
case */


The second bug appears much less likely to occur, and has been in Pine
since at least 3.85, has to do with binary attachments.  Note this was
not a bug generated locally, but as a result of mail that was received
here and the mail generation of a remote site. (elm handles this mail
just fine, which is why I figure it to be a pine bug, though I don't
know how the actual RFC822 specification would describe it.)
The bug appears with a very specific set of circumstances and causes
pine to abort.

In dealing with a multipart message, where the Boundary specification
includes blanks and is not enclosed in quotes, if the message is forwarded,
pine aborts.  Here's an example excerpted from a message that aborts pine
in that case:

And the fix is to parse boundary attributes as a "phrase" instead of a 
"word", as follows:

<           if ((*name != '=') || /* missing value is a no-no too  */
<               !(name = rfc822_parse_phrase ((s = ++name))))
<             param->value = cpystr ("UNKNOWN");
<           else {                /* good, have equals sign */
<             c = *name;          /* remember delimiter */
<             *name = '\0';       /* tie off value */
<             rfc822_skipws (&s); /* skip leading value whitespace */

Date: 13 Oct 1994 10:18:44 -0700
Message-Id: <37jq5k$qpg@skivs.ski.org>

I have a user that dials in on 2 different Macs during the week.
One of the Macs has an extended keyboard & she has no problems 
with Pine (in fact she LOVES it).  But at least once a week she
is using a Mac with a basic keyboard & suddenly the arrow keys
don't work, nor do the <ctrl>v or <ctrl>y.  I told her that I
had read in this group to try an <esc> before the <ctrl> key
and see if that works.

BUT really that's a nuissance and certainly there must be a 
setup for this??  We have Pine 3.90 running on a Sun 4.1.3.

Any hints??

thanks.

The global-address-book is always read-only.  This saves the overhead of
trying to provide locking for updates.  You can insert a default value for
address-book, but putting it in pine.conf.fixed will prevent users from
adding their own additional addressbooks.

Sid,
If you are unable to teach Procomm how to send Ctrl-_ then there is a 
workaround: ESC ESC _

Pine will interpret two ESCAPE chars followed by any other <character> as 
equivalent to Control-<character>

Erin,
Actually you need *two* ESCAPE characters before the desired 
cntrl character, in order to use the control-key workaround.

As far as keyboard setup: Pine just uses the normal ascii character set 
(with a little special knowledge of some typical escape sequences for 
arrow keys.)  So the question is: how to get the Mac communication 
software to send, for example, control characters --espcially if there is 
no control key!

Some Mac communication programs have an option that lets you use the 
Apple command key as a control key.  (I used a MacPlus with Kermit this 
way for several years.)  Even if this fixes the control key problem, it 
may not fix the arrow keys.  The only thing I can suggest there is that 
there are control key equivalents for all four arrow keys: ^P, ^N, ^F, ^B
for previous, next, forward, back.

    Hmmm.  It appears that the news server mentioned below in this post
is failing to read this article as posted to one of its subordinates, so
I'll try posting it to a different server and see if it makes it out to
the world from there.  Apologies if it shows up more than once.

    I have never had any problem with Pine handling 8-bit news or mail
messages, provided that...
  1)  An 8-bit-clean path exists between the sender and the point I read
from.  Note that many mails sent with C-T-E=8BIT are handled by MTAs which
lose the 8th bit without your awareness.  Also, if I try to read news
from any NNTP server in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the main gateway
to the outside world loses bit 8.  This has the result of rendering
relcom.* postings as rather difficult to read with a KOI8-R font, and
loses all C-T-E=8BIT characters in French, German, Danish, Norwegian...
  2)  An 8-bit-clean path exists between Pine and my display and I am using
the correct font.  There are a number of ways this can go wrong too, but
with proper terminal setup and stty settings, I am able to compose and
view 8-bit messages on this xterm started with xterm -font xtrek -e pine
(please ignore typos, I have no idea what I've typed)
Note that if you can correctly view C-T-E=QUOTED-PRINTABLE mail as 8-bit
data on your display, the problem is that some intermediate mailer is
losing your 8th bit, a problem which Q-P was designed to work around
until widespread adoption of 8BITMIME mailers.

Pine itself should pass 8-bit data to the path to your display unaltered,
regardless of whether you have defined an 8-bit charset.  It only matters
for composition of messages.

  Pine caused a Page fault in

  This came up in an alert box which seemed to indicate that I could 
close the application.  But this error is apparently so severre that my 
entire machine was locked up and needed a cold boot.  It's been a long 
time (really) since I have had this kind of error with Windows :).

This error means that you're out of disk space.  Make sure you
perform the build in a large scratch area.  Pine requires over 10MB
disk space free, perhaps much more!

pine-3.91 running under OSF1-2.40. I created a global address book
and provided it to users using /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed.

My problem is that I want people to be allowed to add/delete/modify
entries in the book. When pine shows me the addressbook menu it sez
that the global book is (ReadOnly). What's my problem?

BTW, the book is given access of 0666. No problem there that I can see.

Please email. I'll summarize. Thanks in advance.

It's not really Pine's fault.  It comes down to her terminal program, and 
what sorts of keyboard mapping it allows.  I've found that some terminal 
programs use the Apple key as a control, others may find more novel ways 
of aliasing them.  But you need to dig through the terminal package to 
find out where and how it's handling special characters like that, and 
ask it nicely to stop.  If you have other programs available for the 
task, you might see if one of the others is just more friendly.  It might 
be that the program she uses on the old Mac is expecting a new keyboard 
for some reason, and can't figure out why it's not finding one.

Greetings,
   I am attempting to get the 3.91 PCpine working on my NOVELL net.
I am running the NE2000 packet driver with PDIPX and NEtX.  Pine is 
configured to look at all of my remote PINE folders on an HP-UX system.
Whe nI start PCpine I get a message that it is attempting to open 
the correct remote folder and then it dies with ithe following error:
[(CLOSED) IMAP CONNECTION BROKEN (SERVER RESPONSE)]

   Anybody out there know what this means?  If so could you please
mail me directly?

The IMAP toolkit (distributed as part of the Pine sources, or available
separately from ftp.cac.washington.edu:mail/imap.tar.Z) includes a POP2 
and POP3 server.  These are in .../imap/ipopd

Pine also permits POP access as an undocumented (and presently 
unsupported) capability.

I had the same problem and found the answer in a local Mac newsgroup. 
Apparently Apple did not anticipate the use of the ctrl-@ and ctrl-^ keys
for applications and did not include a keyboard mapping in the system for
them.  Telnet 2.6 has two files that will correctly map these keys to the
right ASCII codes.  If you drop the file "U.S. - Fixed Controls" in your
system folder then goto the Keyboard control panel and select "U.S. -
Fixed Controls" it should work.

Hello.  This error message means that the HP-UX server apparently 
accepted an IMAP connection from PC-Pine, but at some point when PC-Pine 
attempted to read an IMAP protocol transaction from the HP-UX server it 
found that the TCP connection was broken.

The first thing to check is that the IMAP server has been properly 
installed on the HP-UX system.  Do any other IMAP clients work properly 
with that server?  A very common mistake is to set up inetd so that it 
answers IMAP connection requests, but fail to install the IMAP daemon 
program (imapd) in the place where inetd has been configured to expect 
it.

If you do not know what the above means, please contact the managers of 
the HP-UX server for assistance.

I can confirm that using the US Fixed Controls files does *sort of* work 
with a British keyboard.

"Sort of" means that you must use Ctrl/Shift/6 rather than Ctrl/6 most 
"real" terminals let you use.  It also means that the Shift/3 key 
(labelled with the curly-L pound sign) generates a hash (tic-tac-toe) 
sign and Option/Shift/3 the opposite.  This is, of course, the reverse of 
what we Britishers expect in normal applications (but IS what my Telnet 
trained fingers expect of a terminal session!)

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 3.91.  This version is primarily a maintenance release intended to
fix many, though not all, of the bugs reported over the last month or so.
Highlighted fixes include: 

    o  Several address book bugs, including one that could destroy data.
    o  Fixed to allow viewing MESSAGE/EXTERNAL-BODY attachments.
    o  Fixed bug that caused pine-debug files to grow forever.
    o  Custom-header entries may now contain colons.
    o  If read-msg-folder is set, Pine no longer crashes.
    o  Several other bugs resulting in program crashes.
    o  Environment variable and improved list entry support in Setup/Config.
    o  Improvements in mailcap support (e.g., "needsterminal" recognized).
    o  Improvements in signal handling to prevent some loops.
    o  Improvements in user-domain processing.
    o  Several PC-Pine fixes (e.g., send hangs when TZ set, sorting).
    o  New features to better support news reading, and dialup access

Be sure to see Pine's builtin release notes ("R" on the Main Menu) for a
more detailed account of what's changed.  More general information on Pine
can be found via: 

    o  The anonymous FTP archives at ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
    o  The World-Wide-Web page at http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

Pine v3.91 is available via anonymous ftp to ftp.cac.washington.edu from
the file named "pine/pine.tar.Z".  Pre-compiled executables for various
flavors of UNIX can be found in the "pine/unix-bin" directory, and zip'd
copies of the DOS and Windows releases can be found in the "pine/pcpine"
directory. 

Our thanks to all you who have helped with bug reports and helpful
feedback! 

The Pine Team

Just to set expectations correctly:  Pine does NOT currently support the
"offline"  mail processing model which most people expect when they think of
POP.  (POP clients typically pull mail from a mail drop to a local INBOX.
Pine does not know how to do this.)

However, you may simulate normal POP client behavior with Pine by using a
program called "popclient" as a front-end to Pine.  This program was
mentioned on comp.mail.misc last month.  It pulls the mail from the mail drop
(POP server) and stores it locally, where Pine (or any other Unix mailer) may
open it as a local INBOX. 

Integral offline processing via IMAP (and quite possibly POP) is planned for
a future release.  Full "disconnected" operation, wherein a client cache of
messages may be resynchronized with the server, is also planned, but that is
even further out...

Hi, everyone,

	I'm getting linking errors (ld) when I try to do a simple: build nxt

Subject: Is there a version of pico for Nextstep 3.2 running on intel??

I really like the pico editor when using elm but I have just gotten
my nextstep computer running on an intel machine, I have found the 
source code for emacs which does work but I hate emacs so much I refuse
to use it.  Any idea if pico for nextstep 3.2 intel is out there (if source
I could compile it).

thanks,

Bill Ditto

I took the easy road and got the binaries from ftp.novell.de. This

Okay, so I upgraded our version of 3.89 to 3.91 tonight.
I've just finished testing it and everything seems OK
except for one itsy-bitsy problem...

In 3.89 when you hit "r" to reply to a message, it would
ask you "Include original message in reply?" to which
you could answer yes or no.  How do I get the same
functionality in 3.91?  I've set all the options that
seem appropriate, but am I overlooking one?

Maybe I've just been sitting here too long... :-(

Chris,
By default, 3.91 should behave the same as 3.89 in this regard.
However, in 3.91, there is a new feature called "include-text-in-reply",
which IF SET would eliminate the "Include original message in reply? "
prompt.  Any chance that got set inadvertently?

   I would like to hold on to some of my elm features for a while yet., so
I have pretty well been able to keep the two mail systems in tandem (mail
folders etc). I have not been able to have pine read my elm aliase.text
(an address book)...has anyone managed this?? 

   Any help much appreciated...

Ummmm... I've got some C waiting to be compiled which should give me
random .sigs; it's rather home-grown, I'm afraid, but I guess I could post
it if people are interested, after getting permission from the authors I
suppose.

I got into problems with compiling pine because of

I commented out the #define and the compilation went fine. An example
of a conflict occurred where two delarations of rename were

and the other not.

Add the global addressbook file as a local addressbook for the user(s) you
want to edit it, and make sure the file permissions are appropriate.
Multiple users can use the same address file, and even the same mail
folders, provided they have access. It sounds obvious, but it took us quite
a while to figure this out here.....BTW this is for 3.90, but I presume the
same thing works in 3.91.

Date: 14 Oct 94 15:58:05 GMT
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

When I compile packages the use the network, I like to pass args like;
XCFLAGS="-I/usr/local/bind/include"
XLDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/bind/lib -lresolv"

This is not doable with the current Pine "build" setup. In pine3.9.0,
I just edited about 50 makefiles.

I would rather not have to do this for ever.

Now, the imap that came in 3.90, had EXTRACFLAGS, and EXTRALDFLAGS in 
their Makefile for "most" system types. In the imap that comes with 3.91 
this no longer works.

These flags (EXTRACFLAGS EXTRALDFLAGS) are not in any of the pine/pico 
makefiles, anyhow, so there is no way to pass args down to all the makefiles.

In pine/makefile.* you have something like;
$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -o pine $(obj) date.o $(LOCLIBES) $(LIBES)

So trying to add something like -lresolv at the end of the linking stage 
will not work.


Then there is ./build $makeargs; It can handle only the most simple of 
options. 

I would be glad to send back some changes if they would be used/looked at.


The actual options that I am trying to pass are;

XCFLAGS=-DKERBEROS -I/usr/local/bind/include -I/usr/local/athena/include

XLDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/athena/lib -lkrb -ldes /usr/local/bind/lib/libresolv.a


I have added the CMU krb4 patches, and with a few changes have IMAP with 
kerberos V4 support, on SGI, OSF, SunOS4, SunOS5, Ultrix, and HP/UX9.

Thanks for your help.

Pine has the wonderfull feature of being able to print text at home even
though you're dialed in remotely.  Does there exist somewhere a program
that will allow the same thing w/o having to mail something to you?

local-print <file_name>

If someone somewhere has seen something like this lurking around .. I'd
appreciate a push in the right direction.

Subject: Building PINE under UnixWare
Message-Id: <CxoBtn.62D@telly.on.ca>
Date: 14 Oct 94 17:41:47 GMT

I've recently got my hands on Pine 3.90, after being urged by some
people I trust to try it instead of 'elm'.

It won't build onder Novell UnixWare 1.1, using the 'sv4' options to
build.

After saying the compiler couldn't handle ANSI, the build process barfed.

The 'pico' editor compiles and runs fine, but 'pine' itself won't.

Has anyone done the build for UnixWare? Does the recently-released 3.91
release of Pine solve any of these problems? Moreover, why is the SVR4
compiler considered non-ANSI? And does this thing know I don't use
sendmail?

If changes are small, just send 'diff's or the files that are changed. I
could probably track down the stuff myself, but why re-invent wheels?

Any help is appreciated.

What follows is the result of running 'sh build sv4' on the Pine source.

Sorry, I forgot to check Pine-3.90 on an AXP since I did not have much time and
my only AXP was overloaded at that time.
I hope to work soon on the 3.91 and then to test it on AXP as well.

    Sigh.  It appears again that the main news hub for the Czech Republic 
is failing to pick up posted articles from the servers it feeds, so I 
must subvert the system and post outside.  Once again, apologies should 
the original posts materialize anytime in the next couple months or so.

    I have never had any problem with Pine handling 8-bit news or mail 
messages, provided that...
  1)  An 8-bit-clean path exists between the sender and the point I read 
from.  Note that many mails sent with C-T-E=8BIT are handled by MTAs which 
lose the 8th bit without your awareness.  Also, if I try to read news 
from any NNTP server in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the main gateway 
to the outside world loses bit 8.  This has the result of rendering 
relcom.* postings as rather difficult to read with a KOI8-R font, and 
loses all C-T-E=8BIT characters in French, German, Danish, Norwegian...
  2)  An 8-bit-clean path exists between Pine and my display and I am using 
the correct font.  There are a number of ways this can go wrong too, but 
with proper terminal setup and stty settings, I am able to compose and 
view 8-bit messages on this xterm started with xterm -font xtrek -e pine
(please ignore typos, I have no idea what I've typed)
Note that if you can correctly view C-T-E=QUOTED-PRINTABLE mail as 8-bit 
data on your display, the problem is that some intermediate mailer is 
losing your 8th bit, a problem which Q-P was designed to work around 
until widespread adoption of 8BITMIME mailers.

Pine itself should pass 8-bit data to the path to your display unaltered, 
regardless of whether you have defined an 8-bit charset.  It only matters 
for composition of messages.

Hi

find it only works with pctcp something or other.  Is there a version
which works with slipper, or the 8260 packet driver?

	In Pine 3.9x, there's an option for it in the config screen ("S C"
from the Main Menu). It's called "enable-mail-check-cue". Just turn it
off.

I'm sorry if this question has been asked over and over again, and if
someone could point me to a faq or something, I would appreciate it.

But, I'm trying to use "filter" to sort the mail so I could have some of
the mailing-lists not go into my INBOX.

Below is my filter-rules file:


# $HOME/.elm/filter-rules
#
# Filter rules for the Elm Filter program. Don't change without some
# serious thought. (remember - order counts)
#
# (for Rob Hahn, hahn@panix.com)
#
# rule 1
to "gg-l@wizards.com" ? save "$HOME/mail/magic-incoming"
# rule 2
to "mtg-l@wizards.com" ? save "$HOME/mail/magic-incoming"


And here's my .forward file:

"| /usr/local/bin/filter -o /users/hahn/.elm/filter-test"


As of yet, I haven't been able to successfully route my mail in any way,
shape, or form.  What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance!

	Well, here's a portion of _my_ ~/.elm/filter-rules:

if (to contains "CARR-L") then save "/users/gordy/Mail/carr-l"
if (to contains "net-happenings") then save "/users/gordy/Mail/hap" 
if (to contains "socks@syl.dl.nec.com") then save "/users/gordy/Mail/socks"
if (to contains "rre@weber.ucsd.edu") then save "/users/gordy/Mail/rre"

	I noticed a substantial difference in syntax from yours; you 
might try the more verbose way, which at least has the virtue of 
working for me.

	My .forward file, BTW, is:

Subject: HELP INSTALLING 3.91
Date: 13 Oct 1994 18:37:23 GMT
Message-Id: <37jup3$lvu@bigfoot.wustl.edu>

Dear Pine users, I found pine3.91 at ftp.cac.washington.edu
I was trying to install it in my home directory on a ultrix system.
At the moment of compling pine it gives me an error of type
"write failed file system is full". I do not think this means he is
short of memory. 
 I've never done this type of things, so I will appreciate any comments
that will help. Actually, reading this newsgroup, it seems that 3.91 is 
the newest version... I will be happy with a n old version that works. 
Any suggestions?
 Thanks, 



 Carlo

I am not sure what you are saying.  When I reply to a message in pine on
UNIX, it copies the contents of the message into the edit buffer after
asking me if I want it to.  If I wish to delete part of it while in the
editor I can.  I have never seen anything in elm that works any different
from that, but I got tired of waiting for a stable release of elm and never
upgraded to the current version.

Greetings,
  I am attempting to get PCpine running on a local Netware lan.  However, 
I am not getting very far.  I would like for Pine to read a remote 
mailbox on a HP-UX sitting on the same backbone as this netware lan.  I 
hav downloaded all the PCpines and none have worked.  I get errors 
ranging from host not found, IMAP disconnection, and stack drivers are 
not loaded.  

  Is there anyone that has been able to get this working?  If so I would 
like to speek with you. :)  By the way... I am running NE2000 cards with 
NE2K packet drivers. and PDIPX and NETX.  Thanks

Regards,

Our site is using a customized-header "From:" to put the campus-wide 
e-mail alias as the sender's address.  This works fine, but as a side 
effect in the "send-mail" folder, where the recipient's name is supposed 
to be the sender's name is.  Eg:

  N 5   Oct 16 Peter Murray        (1,091) Test message

               ^^^^^^^^^^^^ This came from the "From" line, not the "To" line

I assume it isn't supposed to work that way.

While you are looking at that code, would it be much trouble to pick up 
the address from the customized "From" line and mark those as personal 
messages with the "+" on the left-hand side?

Critical info:  OSF/1 v1.3a, Pine version 3.91

Thanks in advance!

This happens on our system too, as a result of NFS file locking
problems.  The problem is fixed by the following:

1. Kill rpc.statd and rpc.lockd
2. rm -rf /etc/sm /etc/sm.bak
3. Restart rpc.statd and rpc.lockd

Several patches for NFS locking were also required.

Good luck.

Has anyone seen the following when a new user sends email?


Folder "sent-mail" in <Mail/[]> doesn't exist. Create? Y <= ENTER Y
      
[Can't create mailbox Mail/sent-mail: No such file or directory]

This occurs on a DEC Alpha system running OSF/1 3.0.  mail-directory
is set to Mail.  If I manually create ~/Mail, then the error condition
does not exist.  For an unknown reason, pine does not create ~/Mail.

Thank you,

Yes, go into pine/os.h and look for and change the line...

#define DF_MAIL_DIRECTORY         "mail"

to

#define DF_MAIL_DIRECTORY         "Mail"

It seems like defining the mail directory in the global pine.conf is not
enough.

NOTE: the file pine/os.h is a symlink to the correct os_xxx.h file and 
won't be created until you build at least once and gets removed if you 
"build clean"

YET ANOTHER NOTE:  The comments in that file say to think real hard before
changing any of the defaults! :-)    However, we did because other MUAs 
want ~/Mail for folders and not ~/mail.

The only place I've seen it set is in "pine/os.h" in the

   I was wondering if anyone could give me information regarding 
configuring altrenate incoming mail folders, and the auto-routing of mail 
to said folders in pine 3.9x...

I have more info on this problem...

If folder-collections=Mail/[] in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, and a new
user invokes pine 3.90 or pine 3.91 the first time via

pine username

then Mail is not created initially.  Therefore, references to Mail/[]
fail.

If under pine 3.90 the first time user types

pine 

this creates the ~/Mail directory correctly during initialization 
init_mail_dir() routine.  However, init_mail_dir() was changed in
3.91 and Mail directory does not get created if pine 3.91 is invoked

pine

So, pine 3.90 only fails for 'pine username' for initial invocation and
pine 3.91 fails for both 'pine' and 'pine username' invocation.

Richard Jackson

My system has recently upgraded to Pine 3.9, and I've been trying to 
figure out a couple of things, first of which is how to set a new reply 
prefix in pine, if that's possible.  I know it's possible in elm, but 
since elm on this system has pretty much been eating my mail, I figured 
I'd find out how to do it in pine.  Another question I had is if there 
were any way to append random signature files to my mail messages sent 
through pine.  I've looked through the FAQ and haven't found a thing.  
Any replies through e-mail or posts are greatly appreciated.  Thanks in 
advance.

	The only way to do this, as far as I can tell, is at compile time.
There's an option for it in pine/osdep/os-xxx.h

	So if you're not compiling Pine yourself, I think you're out of
luck on this one.

Hi,

One of the neat features of pine is that it shows when a message has been
sent to your address ("+" mark). However, my e-mail addr. can be one of the:
kamk@tuke.sk, kamk@ccsun.tuke.sk, Kamil.Kukura@tuke.sk. It would be nice
to tell pine what address are mine so it wouldn't ask "Reply to all
receipents?"
Hope, I'm not only one with such wish. :)

I compiled Pine 3.90 under solaris 2.3 (with BSD compatability package) and

version of pine ? (3.90) I had not to dissimilar  problems with Pine 3,89
which were solved with 3.90.

Well, I don't know about the forward, but I do have filter
working for the magic mailing list(gg-l).  Heres my rule for it:
	

if (sender contains mtg-l) then
	save "/net/u/2/g/gam/Mail/newmagic"

I think part of your problem may be the "to" in
your filter rules.  The magic mailing list, if I
recall correctly, takes all mail it receives
and than resends it with its own header, so the to
column is your name not mtg-l.  I'm almost positive
it does this is digest mode, and fairly positive it does
it in non-digest mode as well(but since I receive digests
I'm not sure).

Questions, since this makes at least 3 people on the magic mailing
list that I know of, is it possible/a good idea for panix to
set up a local newsgroup and pipe mail from the list to the
newsgroup(and vice versa).  That way we'd cut down on the excess traffic
of having 3+ copies of every message come to panix?

If you're going to be making frequent changes or additions to a shared 
addressbook you probably don't want to actually do it this way.  There is 
logic to detect when the addressbook has changed out from underneath a 
user but it isn't bullet-proof.  That's why global addressbooks are read 
only.  The best way to do this is to move the shared addressbook into 
place every now and then (after a few changes) so that you won't disrupt 
the people using the addressbook.  Suppose you have a shared addressbook 
called "/usr/local/lib/abook".  You might do this:

Somehow create addressbook /usr/local/lib/abook.new and 
/usr/local/lib/abook.new.lu.  One way to do this would be to copy 
somebody's addressbook to abook.new and then run pine with that as the 
addressbook (pine -address-book=/usr/local/lib/abook.new) and open up the 
addressbook to look at it.  A fancier way is to use the create_lu command 
line flag.  Now move it into place:

% cd /usr/local/lib
% mv abook abook.old
% mv abook.lu abook.old.lu
% mv abook.new abook
% mv abook.new.lu abook.lu

By doing it this way, the people who have abook and abook.lu open will 
continue to use those (since the inode didn't change) and the new people 
will get the new one and not have to build the .lu file.

If there are only a few people and things don't change much you can try 
to share a writable address book, and it should work ok.  You will 
occasionally get the "re-syncing addressbook" messages and may sometimes 
get changes aborted if somebody else also changed it.  And, if you are 
still using 3.90 instead of 3.91 you should get 3.91.  There are some bad 
addressbook bugs in 3.90 that can destroy addressbook data.

We switched to Pine 3.91 earlier today.  Since then, I have had two users
complain that their inboxes were corrupted.  Closer inspection reveals
that in each case a number of null characters have been written to the
mailbox at the end of one of the messages.  Has anyone else seen this? 

I am unclear at the moment as to whether this is a Pine 3.91 problem or 
something else.

Aha!  Yes, that would make sense.  The way I was reading it was, "Do you 
want the option of having to ability to include messages..."

Hear Hear!  I agree whole-heartedly.  I wasn't sure why, but was becoming 
farily frustrated with the fact that only SOME messages that were to ME

Thanks. Your reply prompts me to clarify what I was getting at in my original
posting. Due to a misunderstanding from my side my request was very obscure
indeed.
	No, I was not talking about the simple and obvious quote-text-into-reply
-feature of pine. It works fine.  My problem was this. My terminal program
(Vaxterm, created at univ. of Helsinki) has a clever feature: working with
most programs, it saves the screen content which "pours" up and out of your
screen in a large buffer, so whenever you want to you can scroll backwards
through that stuff, copy from it etc. This works for example with elm and
with some newsreaders, but not with pine.
	In my amateurish ignorance I thought this was beacause some copying
mechanism was missing in pine. But in the meantime I have been told that the
this screen buffer is feeded by a linefeed -command from the terminal program
saving the uppermost line of the screen's scrolling area - provided that the
line also is the uppermost physical line of the screen. Now, this last
condition is usually not fulfilled in pine, so it does not work...

Agreed. I'd have joined as well, if it wasn't for the fact I'm already

Another vote for a local group (if you need one).

The best so far is 	pine -if '*{news/nntp}'comp.mail.pine

Not much better! I can't really see why pine couldn't behave 
as it did, ie   pine -if \*comp.mail.pine 	where "*" implies connect 
to the news host as specified in .pinerc/pine.conf

This is a backburner project for PANIX because, while it would be nice,
it takes lower priority than various other things we have to work on.
But it's a good idea and when we have the resources to devote to a
mailing list-to-news gateway, we'll work on it.

I've removed comp.mail.pine from the follow-ups to this part of the
thread, since it is specific to PANIX. -S.

Hello netters,

I'm using Pine 3.89 on a SunOS system and the pico editor works fine within
pine, but when I used just "pico filename" the return key, erase key, and the
control keys DON'T work.

What could be causing this, and how can I fix the problem.

Is it possible to define a .sig file, and have it appended on command, 
rather than automatically?  Better yet, is it possible to have multiple 
.sigs?  If it matters, I am running Pine 3.91 on a RS/6000 360 under AIX 
3.2.5.

I just posted an article inquiring into the best way to set up a
discussion group among users on a system consisting of a Linux
server with pc workstations running WfWG and pc-pine.  No sooner
had I posted the message than it occurred to me that perhaps I
could capitalize on the fact that pine is a news reader as well 
as a mail reader.  It occurred to me that perhaps I could make the
Linux box into a local news server and that would be a way of
implementing my local discussion groups.  Of course, I have no
idea what would be involved.  However, I would sure like to know
whether others think this is feasible.  If it is considered feasible,
any comments on how to proceed would also be appreciated.

Thanks for any help.

Message-Id: <djolley.782342351@kaiwan009>

I'm a newbie to Pine.  I'm running a Linux box as an imap server 
with pc workstations running WfWG and pc-pine.  In reading the
pine documentation, I see references to phrases like "shared
mailboxes", "BBS folder", etc., all of which lead me to believe
that what I want to do is possible.

Basically, what I'm thinking about doing is establishing a
pseudo user on the system so that any mail sent to this pseudo
user could be read by all users resulting an a quasi discussion
group.  I might even establish several different pseudo users,
one for each of several topics.  Anyway, I have long since learned
that whenever I have an idea, someone has already thought of a 
better way of doing it.  So, my question really boils down to this:
What's the best way to set up a mini-bbs/discussion group using
pine in a configuration like mine?  Thanks for any and all input.

Check to see if your ftruncate() call works.  More to the point, look 
through your system-dependent source code in c-client, and see if 
whatever your system uses as a ftruncate() call (SCO, for instance, uses 
chsize()), and test it.  Although chsize() works here fine, I am aware of 
at least one other SCO site where chsize() does nothing at all.  And 
their symptoms are identical to yours.  You see, the NULL's are stuck to 
the end of your mailbox just in case you need them for extra message 
storage.  After the mailbox has been written back out ftruncate() is 
called to shorten it back up, and cut out the trailing nulls, if any.  
Hence, no ftruncate(), you get NULLs.

	It means you're out of disk space! Although this error message
sounds more like a system message than a personal quota message. Hmmm...

Subject: Meaning of .pine-debug files?
Date: 18 Oct 1994 10:04:37 GMT
Message-Id: <3806jl$j7n@eplet.apana.org.au>

I am new to the requirements of unix networks in providing services to other
users and have currently built pine 3.91 to run on a sunos unix platform. The
system is stand-alone, that is not connected to the rest of the world, and I
am trying to run pine without getting into the intricacies of imapd and
whatever that involves. At this point pine seems to be doing the job of
delivering the mail amongst all users, but regardless of whether mail is sent
or not, every time pine is exited by any user a .pine-debug file is created. I
know I can suppress the creation of these files by invoking pine with the -d0
option but this is not kosher with me - I prefer to get to the root of the
problem and eliminate the creation of .pine-debug files legitimately. The
problem is I cannot "see" how to correct the problem from examining the
.pine-debug file.

I have included a typical .pine-debug response (minus a few option settings
which do not seem important to the problem, in order to save space):

BSD UNIX and sendmail.

This is an excellent example of why you must be careful about the type of
assumptions you make about how mail works.  Pine is used with at least
nine different local storage formats, and at least four network protocols. 
The format which uses ``From '' lines is just one of these.  The format
commonly called ``news'' is another.

Hi,

I am using Pine to read my mail through IMAP.
When I am accessing my mailboxes from 2 machines at once, IMAP is 
signalling the older connections that its mailbox has become READONLY. So 
far so good, but when the last/newest connection is deleted again the older 
connection doesn't restart its folder automatically again, neither did I 
find a command to reopen a folder. Only quitting Pine and restarting it 
suffices. 

Problem is that I sometimes fail to mention the (READONLY) status 
indicator and so I am assuming I just don't receive any mail. But when I 
quit Pine and restart it again, there may have been numereous messages 
waiting for me. Ideally, I would like to run Pine 24 hours a day. I use
screen (virtual terminal handler) sessions which I share between work and 
home (by detaching and attaching at the other site) so I alsways can 
continue exactly where I left off. But sometimes I just start a pine 
session to read mail but that screws up the already running instance in 
my screen sessions.

I hope I expressed myself clear enough and I would like to know if 
somebody has some hints for me?


Richard.

We use the Firstname.Lastname-type aliases quite a lot, so we
had this problem too. So I modified Pine to recognize this 
type of alias, if the alias is the same as the Personal Name
variable (spaces changed into dots, of course). But if you want 
the Personal Name to be something like Foo "the Incredible" Bar,
the patch won't help.

I can post my patch (relative to 3.91 now) if there is sufficient 
interest, but it would be better if the Pine team made a more 
general change, perhaps a list of personal aliases configurable
from the Setup/Configure-screen or something.

Hello all,

Sorry about the bulk reply, but we have been inundated by bug reports and
help requests since the release of Pine 3.90.  You have all reported bugs or
problems that I believe are fixed in Pine 3.91, which was just released. 
Rather than individually reply to all of the outstanding reports with
basically the same message, I have decided to send one big message :) The
official announcement of Pine 3.91 should appear on the pine-announce and
pine-info mailing lists and the comp.mail.pine newsgroup shortly. 

Please obtain the new release from ftp.cac.washington.edu and let us know if
you have any further difficulties.  Thank you for your assistance and
patience!

I just built Pine 3.91 on Novell UnixWare 1.1 using the instructions from 
when I built Pine 3.89.  Here's what I changed:

In "pine/osdep/os-sv4.h", uncomment '#define ANSI', comment out
'#define const', uncomment '#define USE_TERMINFO', and change
'#define SENDMAIL "/usr/lib/sendmail"' to
'#define SENDMAIL /usr/ucblib/sendmail".

If you want to change the installed location of "pine.conf" and
"pine.info", edit "pine/init.c", "pine/pine.hlp", and
"pine/osdep/os-sv4.h".  Change all occurences of "/usr/local/lib"
to whatever path you want for those files.

For Pine 3.89, in "imap/non-ANSI/c-client/Makefile", I changed RSH from
"resh" to "rsh" and RSHPATH from "/usr/bin/resh" to "/usr/bin/rsh", but
I don't think it is necessary for Pine 3.91.

After all that, I just ran "./build sv4" in the top directory.  I get
some compiler warnings about "...semantics of <various operators> change
in ANSI C..." and "...argument incompatible with prototype...", but these
all seem to be benign warnings.

You are right that it probably should use the ANSI source for UnixWare,
but I guess there are still a bunch of SVR4 versions out there without
Standard (ANSI) C compilers.

Hope this helps,

I've got an environment where I have a DEC machine with OSF/1 available.  
I don't understand if I can use PC Pine over a Trumpet Winsock PC stack 
to access mail on the OSF/1 machine and have a secure system.  How is 
security enforced on the PC?  I don't want everyone being able to run 
PC on my PC and reading my mail.

Just how does PC Pine work with security on the server?

Thanks a bunch

This is a bug in pine acknowledged by the pine development team.  A fix 
should be in the next release according to an answer to this posted 
earlier.

And the next release (3.91) was made available 11 Oct 94.

We strongly urge everyone to upgrade from 3.90 to 3.91 (even though we 
forgot to change the version number in some of the online text :)

There are a number of important fixes in 3.91.

Hello all,

Sorry about the bulk reply, but we have been inundated by bug reports and
help requests since the release of Pine 3.90.  You have all reported bugs or
problems that I believe are fixed in Pine 3.91, which was just released. 
Rather than individually reply to all of the outstanding reports with
basically the same message, I have decided to send one big message :) The
official announcement of Pine 3.91 should appear on the pine-announce and
pine-info mailing lists and the comp.mail.pine newsgroup shortly. 

Please obtain the new release from ftp.cac.washington.edu and let us know if
you have any further difficulties.  Thank you for your assistance and
patience!

I remember that I saw a message on this newsgroup said that the new 
version of Pine (3.90+) will add a function like Return-Receipt like 
in ELM.  I was thinking how do I do it?   I like PINE a lot but without
the Return-Receipt function, I rather stay with ELM.
Thanx for you info.

    I have never had any problem with Pine handling 8-bit news or mail
messages, provided that...
  1)  An 8-bit-clean path exists between the sender and the point I read
from.  Note that many mails sent with C-T-E=8BIT are handled by MTAs which
lose the 8th bit without your awareness.  Also, if I try to read news
from any NNTP server in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the main gateway
to the outside world loses bit 8.  This has the result of rendering
relcom.* postings as rather difficult to read with a KOI8-R font, and
loses all C-T-E=8BIT characters in French, German, Danish, Norwegian...
  2)  An 8-bit-clean path exists between Pine and my display and I am using
the correct font.  There are a number of ways this can go wrong too, but
with proper terminal setup and stty settings, I am able to compose and
view 8-bit messages on this xterm started with xterm -font xtrek -e pine
(please ignore typos, I have no idea what I've typed)
Note that if you can correctly view C-T-E=QUOTED-PRINTABLE mail as 8-bit
data on your display, the problem is that some intermediate mailer is
losing your 8th bit, a problem which Q-P was designed to work around
until widespread adoption of 8BITMIME mailers.

Pine itself should pass 8-bit data to the path to your display unaltered,
regardless of whether you have defined an 8-bit charset.  It only matters
for composition of messages.

I take it Gunther you are talking about me? (:
Yes, I had this problem with Pine3.90. After I read a new peice of mail or
deleted some mail, it would add a bunch of NULLS to the end of my mailbox.
After some research and conversation with Gunther, it was found out that the
'chsize' function did not work on our system. (Still don't know why to this day)
However, I went and wrote my own, and I now have no more corruption of the mail
box.
I did notice another problem, which is more than likely to be the fault of our
system, of Pine3.90 deleting every other message when consecutive messages were
tagged for deletion.  I looked in the code, and the algorithm seemed to work
like this:
    It would search for the first message with a delete flag.
    It would delete this message.
    It would move all following messages down the array, making message
            #6 to be #5 now.
    It then seemed to increase the Index (some int that points to an
                                          array element).
    With this increasing of the index, it would skip the #5 message.
    All I did to fix this problem was to not increase the index integer when
        a message had been deleted.
Anyone else ever experience this problem?
I am using Pine3.90 for SCO.
Anyways Barry, we seem to have some of the same problems.  If you have any
other questions, please feel free to ask me or Gunther.

With 3.91 (and 3.90) ^Z does not work while composing a message.  I get 
"Unknown command: ^Z".  This worked in 3.89.

^Z works in other part of pine, but not in "compose".

I think I may have inavertently deleted the reply from the pine team...

would one of the pine team please let me know if there is a problem with 
corrupted mailboxes, or adress books in pine v3.91 -- 

I was under the impression that both of these problems had been fixed in 
version 3.91 -- I'm ready to release v 3.91 to the masses, and just want 
to verify the status of above

thanks

Greetings,
  Earler I posted about gettin PC pine working on a Novell Network.  Many 
thanks for all the responses i got.  Well, I am still working onthe same 
problem.  I can do everything in PCpine however, I can not send mail.  I 
have to have a SMTP server on my host.  I _KNOW_ that my host is not 
running one.  The question is where can I get the source so i can get one 
running?  Also would it be setup the same as the IMAP daemons?

Many thanks,
Michael S. Durham

Hi there:

I got question about three different methods to send mail to other 
people.  Mail(compose) and forward will keep the 8bit, but bone will 
strip the 8bit.  Is that a bug?

Thanks!!

Paul,
Pine 3.91 fixes some serious problems with address-book handling in 3.90.
It also fixes lots of other bugs, but the only mailbox corruption report I 
recall seeing was the one from Barry C. that started this thread, 
concerning nulls being appended to the inbox.

We do not yet understand what is causing that particular problem (or even
if it is in fact a Pine bug), but we have not had any other reports of 
extraneous nulls. 

We *believe* that 3.91 is in all respects better than 3.90 (except for 
not having corrected all the references to 3.90 in the help text, and 
having broken the local bug reporting facility.)

If anyone has any contrary experience, please let us and everyone else
know so (a) the problems can get fixed, and (b) folks can make informed
deployment decisions. 

-teg

that doesn't seem to do anything.

(I have procmail sending all my mail from a mailing list called 'alb'

Hi all!  I was just wondering if someone out there knows how to create a 
Reply-To: field in Pine.  I've checked what docs I have, the manpage and 
.pinerc but can't seem to find anything. ):

Basically, I would like to be able to e-mail from my PC (which is 
part-time SLIPed in) and have people's mail software automatically point 
responses towards my e-mail box on my providers' machine.

If anyone knows, please e-mail me as I don't read Usenet all that often 
(too damn busy!).

Thank you,

Message-Id: <1994Oct18.173637.14138@city.ac.uk>
Date: Tue, 18 Oct 94 17:36:37 GMT

After recently sending some mail with a shellscript as an attachment to
a friend, I found out that pine had base64 encoded it.  This seems
rather stupid to me since no encoding was necessary (the file was
plaintext), and therefore doing encoding on it only served to make it
unreadable by mailreaders that aren't MIME compliant.

Surely pine should check wether encoding is necessary before carrying it
out on attachments?  Perhaps this is merely a problem with the
installation at my site (I hope so), but any info/comments are welcome.

	Mark.

Your reply (to some one else) has told me that I am on the right track.  
I am indeed trying to use the elm "filter" program.

I do seem to be having a problem deleting unwanted and empty incoming 
message folders.  They delete, but the next time, they are back and 
_won't_ delete.  But I *don't know why no messages were piped into my 
one (other than INBOX) *real* incoming message folder.

Thanks for your held, Edward.

	Help - suddenly mailing lists do not expand on the Pine To: or

to restore this feature since the users like it.  Any help is appreciated.
This is on a Solaris 2.3 machine.

I noticed this also when I do a select command and the group has hundreds of
messages to siphen though I may do ^Z it won't take me out until the search
is over. Same if I use the tab function to go to the next newgroup and there
are fifty "empty" newsgroups. I solved the latter problem by getting rid of
the newsgroups that were not working so it won't take a million years to 
go to the next available group (thru the tab key function). 

As far as ^z is concerned for compose...it works fine for me, crl.com 
uses ver 3.91 on a SunOs machine.

The only time I could get the "Unknown Command ^Z" statement was when I
took the suspend option out of the configuration. Though I couldn't suspend
anywhere else either, it gave me another message "suspension not enabled" 
but appearantly it works for you. Look at the configuration carefully, If
your not a sysop, perhaps your sysop placed some new restrictions on Pine.

Message-Id: <381k89$9bb@nntp.ucs.ubc.ca>

I built the VMS pine from Israel under VMS V5.5-2H4
It comes up OK and I can read old (& new) messages, with attachments.
If I select Compose it wants to continue a non-existant old message.
Ignoring that, if I have smtp_server defined I get a message 
can't connect to server. I built with the multinet option.
We normally use the MX mailer. If I set the logical
$ define pine_mail_protocol mx
and delete the config item smtp_server
then as far as I can tell  ToItem is correctly set to
mx%"user@node.domain" in [.c-client]vms_mail.c  However
when mail$send_end is called I get an error
%MAIL-E-SENDERR, error sending to user user@node.domain at
and an access violation.

Looking at the temporary file it appears that the To: field is created
in RFC822 form, ie. user@node.domain rather than mx%"user@node.domain"
but that may be correct.

In the configuration screen (Select Main Menu, Setup, Configuration), 
find the line that has 'customized-hdrs:' and add the value:

or whatever return address you want.

Hi,

We would like to add the following functionality to the Pine3.91 client:

We currently use a custon written CSO nameserver client, and would like 
to incorporate it into the addressbook routines to do the following: 

In addition to allowing the user to Select an email address from the 
addressbook and insert this into the To: field when composing, we'd like 
to be able to extract similar information from  a CSO query using the 
above-mentioned CSO client. The user would optionally be able to insert 
this information into the addressbook.

I've had a look at the addressbook code and, although it's not 
impossible, will require a fair bit of coding. I was fortunate enough to 
be told by our Pine expert that I should target this for Pine3.91 
(excellent release, incidently!), rather than our current Pine3.89 - the 
addressbook code is substantially re-written in 3.91 :)

Questions:

1. Anyone done this before
2. Are there any API hooks planned for Pine to allow this sort of thing?

We'd hate to re-invent the wheel or make this more difficult than it 
should be.

Any hints appreciated,

Scotty

Last Monday, we started to use 3.91, and last Monday two users obtained
corrupted mailboxes (aka inboxes).  However, since then we have had no
problems.  My current view is that this was all a coincidence.

We run Pine 3.91 mainly on SunOS 5.x and HP-UX 9.01 boxes.  As I write,
there are currently 73 IMAP processes (/etc/rimapd) running on the
computer holding mailboxes, and on that computer there are 5744 mailboxes
in /var/spool/mail (but not all of these are accessed using IMAP from
Pine).  We use Berkeley mail format (aka mbox) and some version of
sendmail. 

With all this usage of Pine 3.91, in my view there is currently no
evidence to suggest that the corrupted mailboxes were caused by Pine 3.91. 
I'm sorry if I started a false rumour.  I was panicing a bit at the time!

Yes.  It is a pain.

The authors seem to have the insane idea that one can #include a few
system header files, then #define const  (i.e. redefine 'const' to
the empty string), and finally #include other header files.  The
compiler didn't like the type incompatibilities that this
introduced.

Here are the changes I made:

In order to build the system, I used the command:

	./build sol CC=gcc LDCC=gcc OPTIMIZE=-O DEBUG=

But, before doing that, I made the following code changes:

[I also made an additional change to redefine the location of
the 'active' file]

Subject: Local Printing Problems with Pine
Date: 19 Oct 94 19:39:40 GMT
Message-Id: <khaley.782595580@nova>

I have a question, I hope someone here will know the answer.  We have Pine
3.89 installed and running on a SunOS Unix system.

Pine allows the user to print an e-mail message to a local printer,
apparently this can be done via modem.

A user is logged into our system via modem, specifies the proper settings
in Pine for a local print, and tries to dump an e-mail message to his local
printer attached to his PC.

The first screen is printed fine, but the remaining message is printed as
a bunch of jarbled characters.

So, my question is: has anyone encountered this before?  Does anyone know
of a solution?

Any replies to either this group or through e-mail would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks.


Kevin

Using the PC-PINE 3.91....The program doesn't pick up the mail from my SMTP 
servor.  The servor doesn't have IMAP support so I'm trying to access with any 
route I can but so far have not been successful.  I've tried a different 
name-path to point the program to my inbox (that is the same as my name- alas 
no luck)

Also, the program does not ask for my ID when I first enter. 

any help will be appreciated.

A "read-message-folder" attribute is one of many that would be nice to

Either approach would work, with advantages and disadvantages for each.  If
you take the shared-mailbox approach, I would seriously investigate using
tmail as your delivery agent and Tenex format mailboxes.  This will permit
multiple users at the same time without fighting for the read/write lock.

One of my users just noticed that the POP3 daemon (which is the only one
anyone here is using) that comes with the IMAP package in Pine truncates
the last few characters off the end of a message.  This isn't so bad by
itself, but if the last few characters happens to be the "\n}\n" at the
end of a shell script or something, it makes for somebody's extra work.  I
pulled my old 3.90 code out of someone else's closet, and demonstrated the
problem exists there, too. 

I don't quite know where to look in the ipop3d.c source, but I think 
there might be troubles in blat().  Anyone ever seen and/or treated this 
malady?  I am using MMDF mailboxes on a SCO 3.2.4.2 system, so maybe 
there's another weirdness with the four ^A's at the beginning of the 
message or somesuch nonsense.

No - wait a second, here's the code, right in blat():

  puts ("\015");                /* output newline instead of last 2 chars */
  return ++ret;

Anyone want to tell me why?  I'm going to pull it myself right now, but 
I'd like to know what I'm breaking when I do.

The .pine-debug file is *always* created unless you suppress it with -d0.  It
is not any indication of a problem.

Is there a way to have pine take letters coming in from a particular
mailing list (all the "from" lines would be the same) and stick them
into a folder of their own instead of inbox?  This is getting out of
hand!  Thank you....

try using the elm "filter" command. It works pretty well with pine, but 
is kinda complicated... have fun. The elm faq 
(ftp.uu.net:/networking/mail/elm/Elm-FAQ.Z) has a bunch of detail on 
setting it up, look there.

Not so fast!!

The code in ipop3d is that way because the POP3 protocol insists that a 
message must be an integral number of *lines*.  The code ensures that the 
last two bytes are CR LF.  If the last two bytes are anything else, then 
the POP3 client will not see the end of session marker and the session 
will *hang*.  If a CR LF is added, then the byte count (required by 
the POP3 protocol) will be incorrect *and* you'll have an extra newline 
in returned messages in the normal case.

Note that by the time the text gets to blat(), newlines are normalized to 
the CR LF format.

It is theoretically possible in the Tenex and MTX formats for messages to
be a non-integral number of lines; that is, for a message to end with
something other than a newline.  Normally, this does not happen.

It should be impossible in the MMDF format for a message to be a 
non-integral number of lines.  If this is happening, then something is 
wrong with the message size calculation in MMDF format.

In other words, the bug is in the mmdf driver, *NOT* in ipop3d.  Please 
send me a sample message which demonstrates this problem as a Pine 
attachment, and I will fix the bug.

Yeah. I ended up creating a new target called slg (SoLaris Gcc) that does
all the right things. I'll try and get a patch put together that I'll post.

Message-Id: <383tlk$duk@ionews.io.org>

Alright, here's the thing, I'm on a couple of mailing lists (one of which
gets over 100 messages/day) so I have to seperate my mail into different
folders using procmail.  I've got that part to work.

Now, in Pine you're supposed to be able to have different incoming folders
(and you can use <TAB> to go between them) but I can't figure out how to use
this option.

Can anyone help?

Please help i want to keep this program.

not really decided which of several possible approaches to take with it yet.

Here's a set of changes that I found necessary to make to get pine to build.
They may not be the minimal set necessary, as I went down a few blind alleys.
I did no testing of the resulting pine binary other than seeing that it ran.

You can make the from editable by recompiling Pine with the
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM definition uncommented in pine/osdep/os-???.h.  There is
no individual setting for user-id in Unix Pine.

When the "Release Notes" are called up with the "R" command from the main

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an "Export" or "Save" command 
available during display of the Release Notes.

I realize that the "Y" command will work and I can print the Release

Any suggestions?

Thx.!

 A frequent operation in news-reading is "catching up"... that is, 
 getting rid of all the messages in the news group so that you can "start
 fresh".  At the moment, the easiest way to do this in Pine is via the
 Select command.  You would enter the following four keystrokes: ;aad
 Note that the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature must be enabled 
 before you can use the Select command.

I changed my Fcc, and then hid the rich header. When I had the cursor over
the name field, I hit ^v, and the Fcc which wasn't showing, showed up, and
was changed to sent-mail. This is pine 3.91. This is not desirable.

But, surely it was enough in 3.90.  Hasn't this changed in 3.91?

For a long time (since 3.84?), we have had a pine.conf file that includes:
   folder-collections=Mail/[]
   mail-directory=Mail
In the .pine-debug1 file, I now see:
   ========== Current_val options set ==========
   ...
          mail-directory : mail
   ======= Global_val options set (/usr/local/lib/pine.conf) =======
   ...   
          mail-directory : mail
whereas in 3.90 it used to be:
   ========== Current_val options set ==========
   ...
          mail-directory : Mail
   ========== Global_val (pine.conf) options set ==========
   ...
          mail-directory : Mail

But looking at the code of Pine I'm a little puzzled: I can't find what is
causing this change. 

This issue hit us last Monday morning just a few hours after we released
Pine 3.91.  At the same time as the problem was reported to me, Richard's
message arrived (which was comforting!).  We have a shell script to start
Pine and so (for a quick fix) I modified the script to create ~/Mail if it
does not already exist. 

I'm now wondering what the more permanent fix should be.  The version of
Pine that we use is also mounted by other departments.  If (as in 3.90) it
is possible to configure the user's default mail-folders directory in the
pine.conf file, each department can make its own decision on this topic. 
If I am forced in 3.91 to change DF_MAIL_DIRECTORY, it will also determine
the setting for other departments.  For the record, I don't know whether
in practice this is really a problem. 

Help please.  Can someone from the Pine Team indicate what I should be doing.
In what situations will Pine automatically create a mail or Mail directory?
In what situations will Pine assume it has already been created?
Is it true that any setting of mail-directory in the pine.conf file is 
now ignored? 
Is it still true that a user setting mail-directory in the .pinerc file 
has some effect? 

Thanks.

	What problem? The .pine-debug files aren't created because you
have a problem; they're created every time you run Pine just because. In
case something does go wrong. Even if there isn't the teensy weensyest
little problem with your Pine session, then a .pine-debug file will be
created. They're just a precaution. So you have no need to worry. If you
don't want the .pine-debug files to be created, then like you say, you can
run pine -d0. Or this can be set in pine/osdep/os-xxx.h so that they
aren't created for any user by default. Hope this helps!

I am unable to delete junk "Incoming Message Folders" from the Pine 3.91 
"List folders" screen.  The folder name will delete only for the current 
session, but is back if I exit Pine and return.  The unix file is gone 
however, so if I try to delete it the second time, I get the message that 
the folder does not exist.  However if I try to create a folder with that 
name Pine tells me that the folder can not be created because it _does_ 
already exist.  Talk about schizophrenic!  If I delete the folders in my 
.pinerc, this has no effect and the names are magically back in my .pinerc 
file after I again enter and exit Pine.

Is this a bug or is there a way out?

Right it works for me too..
But I was wondering if I could have two rules for the same mail. For ex:

   forward "help"

Any pointers...to get around this is highly appreciated.

	You can't do that directly in the filter-rules file. You have to

In the same directory as you find the folder, you will find a file named 
folder-name.lock.  Remove it.  This is how Pine handles locking 
notification.  If it finds this file, it knows another process has it 
locked, and it can go looking for that process and ask it politely to 
relinquish the lock.  If there is no process identifiable, it just waits 
for five minutes until it overrides the lock by force.  At least, it does 
this on the INBOX.  It sounds like its not doing that for your folder, 
but I don't know the code well enough to know if it should.

Hello, everyone. PINE is such a nice email program, I love it! I
installed it under our ULTRIX system yesterday ans works fine except
that when I tried to use my old email program MSG and I received the
following message:

The binary box is corrupted
rm /u/tie/._.mail and retry msg


So that means I could not use two mail programs

 You don't need to examine the .pine-debug file. Just go into the pine3.91/pine
directory (i.e., where the pine source code resides) and edit the makefile
appropriate to your system (e.g. makefile.sun4 for SunOS 4.1). In this file
is a line something like

DEBUG=	-g -DDEBUG

This line contains the DEBUG C pre-processor macro which turns debugging on. To
get rid of debugging and thus the .pine-debug files, you need to change this
line like so -

DEBUG=	#-g -DDEBUG

and then rebuild pine.

Hi,
	I'm trying to set up pine so I can read mail going into /usr/mail 
on a server attached to this machine via NFS. I can't seem to configure 
pine to do this, and keep getting "cannot open inbox..." error messages. 
The pwd of the inbox would be something like /net/host/usr/mail
	Any ideas??

		cheers,

			Mike.

I can't find any file, anywhere with the name "*.lock" I used the find command
to do this...it is my INBOX that is locked. It is pine version 3.90 if that
makes any difference...

What file/s can I remove from my directories after I've compiled Pine 
3.91?  It's HUGE and I'd like to get rid of as much as possible.  Thanks 
for any help or information you can give!

    Are you telling procmail to save messages into mailbox folders in
your $HOME/mail/ directory?

   Hit 'L' from the main menu or the mailbox index to bring up a list
of your mailbox folders.  Then use the arrow keys to select one and
press Return to open it.  It looks in your $HOME/mail/ directory, so
make sure procmail is saving stuff in there.

Subject: Problem with PC-Pine 3.91 Configuration
Date: 22 Oct 1994 05:10:35 GMT
Message-Id: <38a6sb$j0o@agate.berkeley.edu>

Dear netters,

I'm trying to set up my PC Pine 3.91 from my home SLIP acct.
I was trying to connect to uclink.berkeley.edu, in which this is 
where all my mails go to, but then it says something like:
 "Can't connect to uclink.berkeley.edu, 143 : Refused 10061"
 "No folders opened."

Part of my Config is:
user-domain = uclink
smtp server = uclink
inbox path = {uclink}INBOX
folders-collection:*{uclink}mail/[]

>From talking to the root of uclink, they don't have IMAP server 
and I think they recommend me connecting to POP server first
then map that to Pine...I don't know how though.

Can someone tell me what I did wrong in the config? All my
mail folders, including inbox is in the mail directory in my home
directory.

Thanx and I appreciate your help!

PS: Please e-mail me for suggestion.
James

I did not send this to the news group, yesterday when I replied, but if you
use;
 CC="gcc -traditional" LDCC=gcc 
you should not have much of a problem with the build. I did not need to 
patch anything, except I just edited pi*/makefile.sol and c-client/Makefile
by hand, but mostly because of other reasons. I am using Pine/Imapd with 
kerberos support.

If it behaves like one of our early version of another MIME compliant
mailer, then only 1 8 bit character will cause the mailer to encode
the entire thing. Our mailer supplier then changed the encoding to
Quoted-Printable so that only the offending character would be
encoded.

The difference is really noticable when starting and quitting pine. Why?
Can 3.90 be sped up?

I just set up the winsock version of pc-pine (pcpine_w.zip I believe) 
running over the Trumpet Winsock over a direct Ethernet connection, and 
it seems to work fine.  I just unzipped the files in a directory for 
pine, dragged the pine.exe from the file manager to a group in program 
manager, and ran it.  I was confused at first as to how to enter the 
INBOX name.  I ended up going into setup (in the pine menu), entering 'C' 
for Configure, and going down to the "inbox-path" entry, where I changed 
it to the path of my INBOX on the Sun machine that is our mail server.  
The only real trick is in how to specify the inbox-path.  For my setup, 
it is "{sol.ashland.edu}/usr/spool/mail/dprez".  You do need to use the 
curly braces around the name of the server, and the INBOX path needs to 
be where your INBOX really is stored on that server.  I also set up 
folder-collections in a similar fashion, my entry is 
"{sol.ashland.edu}~/mail/[]".  The rest of the entries were pretty easy 
to understand, and only a few really needed to be filled in.  Thats about 
it for the PC setup, and everything seems to work pretty well.  On the 
server, you should make sure that the IMAP server is running, or you 
won't get anything.  I hope this helps, once it is set up, it is really 
nice.

Yes.  They're being saved to my $HOME/mail/ directory.  

One other thing, since I didn't figure out a way of procmail leaving stuff
in the normal io.org INBOX I'm saving the stuff that I don't seperate to the
mailing list folder(s) to $HOME/mail/current so in actual fact that's my
incoming folder.  Is there any danger of me losing any e-mail with this
method?  And if so, is there anyway to tell procmail to keep other messages
in the remote IO.ORG?

Yeah, that's the process I'm using now, but I *KNOW* (because I did have it
working ONCE) that there's a way to make Pine think there's more than one
incoming mail folder so you can just hit <TAB> and go to the next one w/ new
messages.  Basically, it just makes the process a bit easier because using
the method you mentioned, I have to hit 'L' then go down and select 'see
expanded list of folders' (or something like that) and then select my
folders.

Nothing in the man pages about it though...  Oh well.

I am having the exact same problem, using PC-NFS 5.1, MSDOS 6.00.
It does connect successfully the very first time it is configured,
and then never again afterwards until I delete the PINERC file
and start again. In my case, the imap server is fine, as we have
lots of Unix pine 3.91 users connecting to it also. Can't
figure this one out...

Message-Id: <389ebi$iso@mizar.usc.edu>


Back in the day when I used UCB mail on my Sun system, I could set the
"metoo" variable in my ~/.mailrc, which would allow me to receive mail
that I sent to an alias on which I was included.  This doesn't seem to 
work with Pine (using 3.91 as of this writing). 

In other words, is there a way that I can get Pine to send the message to
me as well, if I just address the message to an alias that I'm on? 
(without putting my address explicitly on the CC line, that is)

Thanks for any advice you can give me.

I love Pine's ability to print to an attached-to-ansi printer.
Ansiprt, which comes with Pine, is a way to print files outside
of Pine (either with "ansiprt < filename" or at the end of a
pipeline "|ansiprt") but it doesn't seem as robust as Pine's
Y command.  Often with ansiprt some characters are lost.  Do
other people experience this or is this a problem with my
system?  Also, what other tools are there for doing this -
I know about ansiprint (note this is different than ansiprt)
but it also isn't very robust.

Thanks much,
Nancy

Check the document "Secrets of Pine 3.9" which was offered to you the 
first time you used that version.  In the section "How to use Incoming 
Message Folders", is the following:
     Pine has no knowledge of how mail delivery is done on any given 
     computer, so it is not feasible for Pine to control delivery 
     filtering.  That means you must use whatever delivery filtering tools
     are available on your system to provide this function.  ... 

I hope this helps, -mr

Nuno,
Here's my own incoming-folders entry from my pinerc; perhaps it will help.
Note that this is *not* the "folder-collections" variable...

incoming-folders=PINE-INFO {phantom.cac.washington.edu}pine-info,

Craig and Mark:
Pine MIME-encodes all attachments, even text, in order to guarantee their
integrity when passing thru gateways.  (Sometimes integrity matters even for
text.)

When sending text to recipients without MIME capability, use Ctrl-R in the
composer (in the msg body) to include the desired text, rather than attaching

Even better would be to help your recipients get MIME capability, either via
a MIME-capable mail reader, or a stand-alone decoder.  For example, CMU's
"munpack" program will work well, and is available for several platforms
(e.g. unix, mac, pc, amiga).  It's available in ftp.andrew.cmu.edu:pub/mpack/

Nancy,
I don't really know what's going on here, but I suspect a flow-control
problem.  The ansiprt code is *very* similar to what Pine uses.  The main
difference (new in Pine 3.91) is that you now have an option in Pine of
ignoring (the new default) or preserving XON/XOFF characters.  I believe
ansiprt will preserve them... so if your printer or comm software sent an
XOFF, ansiprt will stop sending until an XON is received.  That should work
fine *if* the XON is forthcoming. 

I gather that if you print the same msg via ansiprt and Pine's
attached-to-ansi option, that the former loses characters.  Are the lost
characters in big chunks, or scattered throughout? 

You might also experiment with the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature,
and see if one or the other settings makes Pine as flakey as ansiprt. 

-teg

p.s. the change in default was made because too many people were reporting
bugs about Pine "hanging" when they inadvertently hit ^S (XOFF).

Hi!

Try using your complete domain name and complete paths.

My config works fine as follows:

user-domain        = clark.net
smtp-server        = clark.net
nntp-server        = news.clark.net
inbox-path         = {clark.net}/opt2/mail/mjoneill
folder-collections = Saved Mail c:\trumpet\pine\savemail\[]
                     ClarkNet {clark.net}/opt2/usr/mjoneill/mail/[]

I also ran into problems because of a line I added to the 'hosts' file
in my trumpet directory (I had my host's name in place of my own PC's
name).  Until I corrected this, I got the EXACT same error message.

Can anyone help me? I've set up a filter-rules file in my ~/.elm

I have the enabled-incoming-folders option but I can't seem to get it to 
work! What I am trying to do is set up a filter to send all mail that is 
sent specifically to me into a folder other than the inbox folder. Is 
there anything else that I need to do or correct?

Any help or suggestions would be very welcome.
Thanks,

Can one compose and send Spanish-language text using Pine? 
I.e., is it possible to include inverted the question mark and
the inverted exclamation point, n with a tilde over it, accent
marks over letters, etc.?

Hi...

	Hate to ask it...but when we use pine to try and
read a relatively large mailbox (ie. 22Meg), rimapd dumps
core and closes connection.

	the mail folder is fine, elm can read it in, just 
pine fails.

	I have the newest versions...imapd-3.5 and pine-3.91.

	anyone experience this?  any way to fix it?

Thanks...

This is my first time installing PC-Pine, and I'm having some trouble.
I seem to have configured everything fine, but pine keeps saying:

	[Host not found: vi01.bur.visidyne.com]

I can ping the server just fine, and I've tried all the alias names
but nothing makes any difference.  My only thought might be that it
REALLY means, "IMAPD server not found" and that I installed imapd
wrong or something.

Can anyone make a suggestion or tell me where to find a dos version of
mtest... though if it can't find the host, there's no way mtest is going
to work.

Thanks for ANY help,

-Morgan

seperated from the message body by a "--" line.  ELM automatically
adds the line for you.  Is there a way to configure PINE to do
the same?

Is it possible to send a mail message "Return Receipt Requested"?  IOW 
I want to get a positive confirmation when the receipient actually has
read my message.  I know that Z-Mail supports this as well as many
PC-based mail programs.

Thanx!

Sorry, Evan, I didn't compile this puppy, so I can't help with the compile

od sendmail. This is a configuration option available in the .pinerc file.

    Not that I can see.  Procmail is fed messages through the .forward
file, so there is no file access contention on your mailbox.

    I don't know.  You could re-mail stuff back to yourself (and that
would go to your mailbox on io.org), but procmail will need some way
of preventing mail loops.

    Really?  That would be neat.  I switch between my INBOX and my
Received folders all the time.  It would be great to switch between
the two with a single keystroke.  Tab by default is bound to "Show
next unread" message though.  Perhaps there is something in the Pine
config options that I missed.

    I'll put the Pine 3.91 tech notes in /usr/local/lib/pine if you
want to take a look through there.

Subject: Conversion between mail alias file formats (Pine, Eudora ...)?
Date: 21 Oct 1994 21:47:13 GMT
Message-Id: <aron-2110941447130001@seaotter.berkeley.edu>

  Two recent postings to the comp.mail.pine newsgroup asked about the
availability of converters between Pine Address Books and the e-mail
address 'alias' files used by other mail programs.

  (In these instances, the question specifically concern conversion
between the Pine .addressbook format and the mail alias file formats used
by elm and /bin/mail).

  We're in a related situation:  we're supporting and distributing the
freeware versions of Eudora for the Macintosh and MS-Windows, and would
like to make conversion utilities available to our campus community that
would enable them to easily convert their mail aliases files between Pine
(which is widely used on our shared UNIX systems here) and Eudora.

  We're willing to write our own utilities for this purpose, but don't
want to 're-invent the wheel'.  So we're asking the participants of this
group:  do you know of pointers to existing scripts/source code for
converting these mail alias file formats?

For what it's worth, both PC and Mac Eudora support the .mailrc format.  I
don't know Pine's .addressbook format, but I would imagine that there's
probably some conversion routines to .mailrc, since .mailrc is so common.

I have no need to forge a message. But I do have a domain that has been 
assigned to my organization that is not the same as the domain that the 
provider has. That is, I want mail to look like it came from my domain, not 
from the internet provider. I am able to change the domain name based on the 
entries in .pinerc; however, the userid portion is not changeable - it uses my 
host login name. So my mail looks like it was sent by humansyn@humansyn.com, 
when I really want it to say jjg@humansyn.com. But thanks anyway.

Date: Sun, 23 Oct 1994 03:35:53 GMT
Message-Id: <jjg.30.2EA9DA19@humansyn.com>

How would I setup my addressbook in pcpine so that it points to my 
.addressbook on the host? Do I need to put the mail host name in the curly 
brackets, and then the path to my account?
  For info, my inbox is {mail.msen.com}inbox - I don't seem to need to put in 
any directory, although my .addressbook is in my personal directory 
(obviously) on the remote unix machine.

I've found a work-around.  The problem only occured when the files had 
nicknames.  If I deleted the nicknames in my .pinerc and recreated the 
file by making one and copying it.  _Then_ I could delete it and it 
*stays* deleted.

So the problem seems to be with using incoming folder nicknames.

U automatically capture the archie (or whatever UNIX command/s U use)

e.g U can search, replace, delete, save .... The world is you oyster.

Not to mention, there R GUI emcses out there (LUCID,JED, etc ) to chose

Also, emacs has its own newsreaders, mail readers, etc ... as options.

I am composing this w pico because my adm has screwed around w the emacs

You don't say, but I'll assume you're using a Mac (since the DOS version 
of Telnet is only at 2.3.07). Here's how:

Included with the NCSA Telnet distribution
(ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Telnet/Mac/Telnet2.6/Telnet2.6.sit.hqx) is a file
called "U.S. - Fixed Controls". If you are using System 7 (if you aren't,
don't bother, it's near to impossible), drag this file to the System
Folder. Answer yes to the resulting dialog box. Then go to the "Keyboard"
control panel, and hit "U.S. - Fixed Controls". Now ctrl-^ will work (note
that it's ctrl-shift-6, not ctrl-6). Anyhow, have fun.

The standard workaround for this is to use ESC-ESC-^ (etc) ie to replace 
the use of control with ESC-ESC

Marc -

The most likely explanation for the problem is that Pine (local mail) or
imapd (remote mail) ran out of virtual memory.  c-client (the internal
engine used by both Pine and imapd) does not tolerate malloc() failure; if
the single malloc() in all of c-client/Pine/imapd returns 0, it issues an 
``Out of free storage'' message and core dumps.

c-client's drivers for the two primary UNIX formats of mail -- bezerk and 
mmdf -- both read the entire mail folder into memory.  Thus, a 22MB mail 
folder requires at least 22MB (plus overhead) of virtual memory for the 
process.

The reason this is done has to do with rewriting the mail folder (as in
changing flags, or expunging).  Since a message can grow as a result of
flag setting (writing the Status:/X-Status: lines), it is necessary to
have a scratch area to hold the mailbox.  There are two possible scratch
areas: virtual memory and the disk.  With virtual memory, you do a single
pass write of the new in-memory state to the disk. With the disk as a
scratch area, the entire mail folder in its new state needs to be written
to a scratch file, then it needs to be copied back on top of the original
mail folder.  You can't rename() since several other UNIX mail tools
require that you not change the inode of your mail folder.

With either choice, you face the risk of running out of resources.  You
either run out of virtual memory, or you run out of disk.  My belief is
that many more people run out of disk (due to disk quotas) than run out of
virtual memory; this is based upon the number of people who send messages
reporting conditions when you exceed disk quota compared to the number of
reports such as yours.  Furthermore, the virtual memory method is faster. 
My suspicion is that Elm made the opposite choice. 

Fortunately, there is a way out.  If you want to have godzilla mail
folders (and 22MB fits that description) and lack the virtual memory to
support it, you can use an alternate format supported by c-client that
does not have this restriction, such as tenex or mh format.  Tenex format
has a fixed-width field to allocate space for the flags, so c-client is
able to do mailbox updates in place without ever having to have the entire
folder in memory.  The tenex driver will automatically read new mail from
your /usr/spool/mail file and convert it on the fly to your ~/mail.txt
file.  The disadvantage of Tenex format is that it is a different (read:
incompatible) format and Elm won't be able to read it. 

There is a tool called mbxcvt on our FTP server which can convert between
mailbox formats.  I suspect that mbxcvt will also encounter the same out
of memory program (since it too uses c-client), but you can use Elm to
split the godzilla mailbox in halve or quarters, convert with mbxcvt, then
rejoin them.  If you need any help in figuring out how to do this, please
let me know. 

I regret the problems that you are having.  As you can surmise, it was a
calculated gamble that was made, and most of the time we win it.  Users
who have nasty disk quotas that won't even let them make temp files
appreciate the current behavior.  Unfortunately, there are times when we
lose the gamble, and are stuck with having to offer the consolation prize 
of ``you can do it if you change your mail format''.

Thank you for your interest in Pine, and again, sorry for the hassles!

Can I delete the files imapd, pico and mtest and have Pine 3.91 still run 
without problems?  If not, which ones can I delete?

And... After installing, do I need to keep my /Pine3.91 directory after 
having moved the bin files to a new location?  Are there any special 
files in there I should keep?  Thanks for any help or information you can 
give!

I've got filter to save mail sent directly to me into an incoming folder 
other than INBOX, but I don't seem to be getting any of my usual mailing 
list messages (some of which I get fifty a day) in my normal INBOX. I've 
tested it by disabling my .forward file for about 10 minutes and in that 
time I received about three mailing list messages. What am I doing wrong? 
Any suggestions?
Thanks,

This is my first time installing PC-Pine, and I'm having some trouble.
I seem to have configured everything fine. It does connect successfully the very
first time it is configured, and then never again afterwards until I delete the
PINERC file and start again.

Thanks for ANY help,

-Carlos

My point was that the attachment only contained 7-bit ascii characters 
and so integrity was not improved by base64 encoding it, it just makes it 
harder for people to read if they don't have MIME-compliant mailreaders.  

The reason I prefer to attach things like this rather than simply include 
them is because it makes it easier for people to extract them from the 
mail message (the attachment can be saved, rather than saving the mail 
message and deleting unnecessary stuff by hand).

Mark,
Unfortunately, your belief that only 8bit characters are subject to 
corruption by mail gateways and transport/delivery agents is incorrect.  

Were your assumptions correct, I would completely agree with your conclusion. 
However, long lines, trailing blanks, tabs, leading "From " lines, etc, are
all vulnerable to modification by certain mail transport or delivery agents. 
We believe that attaching a file in PIne, text or otherwise, should be as
reliable as sending it via FTP.  This goal cannot be achieved without encoding.

Opening and closing folders in Pine are time consuming especially
when compared with msg.  Msg has the concept of the binary box to
speed up folder acces.  Is there something like it in Pine?

Gentlemen:

I have been using Pine since opening my e-mail/Internet
account - about a year ago - with "Pluto", a Unix machine
located at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Mount Scopus
Campus.

Being partially disabled, I do 99 percent of my work with
Pluto from home, by modem.

Because of the high cost of telephone time in Israel, I try
to keep my online time as brief as possible.

I often receive long e-mail messages, which I must import
into my home PC for analysis and review. To do this, I first
"export" (via Pine) these messages to my "current directory"
in Pluto and then use the Unix "Get" command to import it
into my PC's hard disk ("c:\kermit" subdirectory).

This process is slow considering the speed of my modem, 2400
baud, and consumes quite a bit of costly online telephone
charges.

A few days ago, all Pluto users were informed that a new
version of Pine -- 3.91 -- has been installed. From my
reading of the notes on this version, I thought I had noticed
a solution to my "problem", by use of setup-configuration.
However, though I tried, nothing has changed.

Is there any command in Pine 3.91 that would enable me to
"export" some of my incoming messages DIRECTLY to my home PC
rather than to my "current directory" workspace in Pluto?



Thank you.

Aaron Sittner


(Before writing this letter, I attempted to get an answer
from local system operators. However, none of them seem to be
sufficiently familiar with the new version to advise me.)

Can I add or change a Reply-to: field in the Pine headers?  So far, I've 
been doing it in the Body of the message, but heard that it must be in 
the header for it to work automatically.  Is there a way to do this in 
pine 3.91?  Thanks!

no, this doesn't work... Pine inserts a space between the last header and 
the body of the message.

Okay... from the main menu:

1) Hit "S" (Setup)

2) Hit "C" (Config)

3) go down to "customized-hdrs"

4) Hit "A" (Add)

5) Type in "Reply-To: dlegate@s1.csuhayward.edu" (or whatever)

6) Hit return

7) Hit "E" (Exit)

Viola!

This is assuming you want to use the Reply-To: header every time. If not, 
simply enter "Reply-To:" for step 5, and for every message you want the 
reply-to header in, hit ^R (Rich Hder) and enter it in the Reply-To: 
field manually.

Hello , I am using Pine 3.89 on a Sun unix box.

I am trying to get ispell to be my default speller when using pine.
I have setenv SPELL /usr/local/bin/ispell in my .tcshrc file

When I go to spell in pine it displays the same info on the screen as 
it would of if I had type > ispell no-file-name. I then have to do a 
cntrl-L to refresh the screen, and the ispell doesn't worrrrk as you can
see.

Any thoughts.

set it to "/usr/local/bin/ispell -l" instead. That should work (as well 
as can be expected.)

I'd like to be able to use my SUN Keyboard's PgUp/PgDn keys when
in Pine and Pico.  Emacs recognizes the keys and so did ELM.  How
do I make Pine/Pico recognize them?

Thanx!

Hi all,

I've been using all 3 versions of Pine to access my mail message store 
via IMAP and I'm now in a position where I want to provide the service to 
our users at Hull ( Up till now they've only had the UNIX version 
available to them). The problem is that I keep getting the 
Bug in PC-Pine detected out of free storage message appearing... 

Our networked PCs have about 504K of conventional memory free... I'm not 
sure about /extended/expanded memory at the moment. I can connect to our 
mail server machine using a userid that has never used e-mail before and 
PC-Pine will crash. I can then use the same machine to connect to my 
account and I can  read manage/compose and send  mail o.k.

I'm a bit unsure as to where to start looking for the problem.

Are any of you using PC-Pine3.91 from Remote booting PCs in a Novell 
Networked environment? (I assume it must be a fairly common configuration)

What sort of PC setup are you using.?

Has anyone else had problems with the "out of free storage" problem?

Alex

Greetings:  Over the past several weeks I have seen comments about bugs 
in release 3.90 and that 3.91 has fixed over 100 bugs. My question is: 
should I wait for further bug fixes and stay at rel 3.89. I don;t want to 
add more problems than I can handle if I don't require any of the new 
features? Is rel 3.91 as stable as 3.89?

Comments?

Thanks
Jim

'printmail' almost does what I want except it doesn't format the mail body where 'par' does nice formatting but it didn't recognize the header and footer so it formatted them too which is not what I what. Anybody out there has any suggestions? You help will be appriciated.

Yes, we have.  We're using PC-Pine 3.91 on our Netware 3.11 network and 
we see this message on machines (mostly 286's) which don't have a lot of 
free conventional memory.  Apparently, PC-Pine likes a lot of free 
conventional memory.  I don't know what the magic number is, but we seem 
to have no problems on machines which have at least 520K free.  The 
aggravating part about this is, and I'm sure you know what I mean, is 
that it doesn't warn you when you first go in that there is enough memory 
for it to handle everything.  You can go into Pine and be happily working 
away when all of a sudden you'll get kicked out with the "out of free 
storage" message.

My solution has been to fiddle with the various drivers, loading as many 
high as possible to free up as much conventional memory as possible.  We 
use MS DOS 6.2, by the way.  I find it amazing that PC-Pine has memory 
shortage problems on machines which WP 5.1 has absolutely no problems.  
What's up with that, Pine Team People?  Why does PC-Pine need so much 
free conventional memory?

As far as your apparent inbox-reading problems, let me point out that not 
all imapd versions are created equal.  When we were first having problems 
(with 3.90) I downloaded the imap from cac.washington.edu (the one 
pre-compiled for Solaris 2.3) and had mucho problems on our Sparc5.  PC's 
would have difficulty reading some INBOX files which became corrupted, 
yet the Unix mail program had no problem reading the INBOX.  I switched 
back to the previous imapd version then had absolutely no problems.  Try 
changing imapd versions.

I don't think it's a pine issue though... it depends on your emulator (I=20
guess)... 'cause I can do it from home, but my brother (he uses a mac) can'=
t.
Just press: Alt-(ASCII Code),
for instance:
for accent on "a": Alt 160

Some emulators work, some don't.

P.S. If you can see the following vowels with accents, then your emulator=
=20
can do it:  =E1=E9=ED=F3=FA

When specifying folder-collections, among other things in my pine.conf, Pine 
seems to assume the path is relative to a user's home directory.  I am trying 
to setup mail in a common area outside a user's home directory.

This is on AIX 3.2.x and Pine 3.89.  Any help would be appreciated.

Date: 25 Oct 1994 20:44:21 -0000
Message-Id: <38jqn5$73m@rowan.coventry.ac.uk>

Hi,
	I was just wondering how useful people think it would be if
	pine's addressbook suppressed list members unless an actual
	list is selected for inspection/modification..... the only reason
	i mention this is that our system wide addressbook has numerous,
	large addressbooks and when you simply want to move down your
	'list of lists' you also have to plough through the list of 
	recipients. Are any thoughts/comments on suppressing the 
	list memberships, until a list is actually selected in some way?

	Just curious.

Message-Id: <davidp.209.00CAEF1C@qpsx.oz.au>

I have read the technical spec and user guide, so here goes.....

In Pine 3.90, is it possible to display the files starting with "." in the 
MIME attachment file manager ? I can type the filename by hand, but it would 
be nice if they were visible.

Also how can I put a comma "," in a custom header ? It appears that the 
custom header list is comma separated. I have tried \, and ",", but both 
result in those characters being in the text. All text after the comma becomes 
the next custom header .....

cheers,
davidp.

Dear Pine Team, dear Pekka

tried to compile pine3.91 under convex_os11 with /bin/cc.

I finally got it compiled when I removed these two lines 

extern char *malloc();
extern char *realloc();

from ./imap/non-ANSI/c-client/os_cvx.h

There are still some warnings which I include below.
pine seems to work. However, when quitting pine I get the message:
Error resetting signals: Interrupted system call

BTW: Is there a need for the 3.90 workaround -string read_write

Yours

I haven't had time to test 3.91 on Convex.  It looks like the problem in
3.90 but I'm not shure. For some reason I don't get the message whe in run
sunig '-d 9'. I'll try to look in it more closelly tomorrow.

I agree with your very practical suggestion.  I'd like to see an addbook
feature in pine that allows either a seperate folder for the distribution
lists (like a subdirectory), or a tack-on feature that could be custom
configed (like the signature-at-bottom command) so that all the lists will
be grouped at the end, preferably by the group name as you suggested. 
Also on my wishlist is a means of surpressing all the names from appearing
(as in the listserv addressees) in the composed message  (taking up
extra bytes) - in other words, like your idea to have only the list names
in the addbook, the recipient line would feature only the group's name.

I think you can order the addressbooks with various keys.....

you can sort of do this. Use the Bcc field and it won't then list the 
recipients getting the message.

Date: 26 Oct 1994 13:43:54 GMT
Message-Id: <38lmeq$cbv@news.utdallas.edu>

On PINE 3.9X, I put my global addressbooks in the directory
/var/spool/mail/pinestuff (/var/spool/mail obviously being the
location of the INBOX) for UNIX using NFS.  Our Novell guy tried 
to access them via IMAP and claims he got some type of permission
denied message.  I know the files are readable to everyone as all
UNIX users can access it.

Is there something in the IMAP server that blocks access to it?  Or
does anybody have any other ideas?

Pine does not currently support remote addressbooks.  Some form of

I don't know if this has been reported yet, but:

Accessing message/EXTERNAL from pine *almost* works! 

It sends a message to the right mail server, however, 
according to both the message returned from the mail server,
and the message displaying what Pine was about to send when
it asked for confirmation, it didn't include the body of the
message ( "SEND filename" ) contained in the body of that
MIME part. 

But I'm glad to see you guys are working on adding those features. 
( I haven't yet tried one that specifies anon-ftp. ) 

Good news is that the version I compiled "out of the box" hasn't 
yet hung up on me in AIX. I didn't bother to grab the distributed
binary first because I assumed I would still have to change 
termcap/curses to work. But I decided to go ahead an build it 
"as is" before changing anything.

It doesn't look as if the makefile defaults for a32 have been
changes from curses to termcap ( the previous fix required ).
Is this (so far) fault free operation due to some other change ? 
Or have I just been luck so far ?

This is fast becoming a FAQ!

Quick answer, upgrade to DG/UX 5.4.3! :-)

... else you need to change the prototype for inet_addr yourself or 
override it.

>From the release notes for 5.4.3R3.00...


        /usr/include/arpa/inet.h has a revised prototype for
        inet_addr(3N), which converts dot notation Internet addresses
        into internal form.  The return type changed from a struct
        in_addr to an unsigned long to comply with prevailing practice
        and standards such as OCS Net.  There is no object or binary
        impact because both return types are returned the same way by the
        compiler, as required by OCS.

        The types of source code changes required include:
        (struct in_addr) = inet_addr; becomes
        (struct in_addr).s_addr = inet_addr;
        and
        (unsigned long) = inet_addr.s_addr; becomes
        (unsigned long) = inet_addr;


So the *correct* prototype should look like...

       unsigned long inet_addr(char *cp);

Subject: Multiple copies of .addressbook
Date: 27 Oct 1994 08:20:31 GMT
Message-Id: <38nnsf$3pj@ob1.uws.EDU.AU>


People,

Is it at all possible for me to have multiple .addressbook's for use with
pine?  What I want is the following...


.addressbook = My 'normal' standard addressbook, filled with the addresses
		that I most commonly use :)

.thelist = A 'special' list of addresses that I want to access _seperately_.

I want to be able to switch from one to the other at any time

Is this at all possible?  My main reasoning is that when a new person is
added to 'TheList' (.thelist), it is my job to send the file (.thelist) to
all the 'subscribers'.

Can anyone help me?

Thanx,
Paul Snedden.

PLEASE reply to raah@music.macarthur.uws.edu.au NOT this address.
Thank you :-)

Well, for newbies, I had a 386 based system running USL system V release 4.2.
So I looked in pine3.91/pine and saw the .sv4 files and went back to the
top directory level and typed: build sv4

Um, unfortunately now when it compiles it dies where it compiles
addrbook.c:


Making Pine.
        cc -DSV4   -g -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"SV4\" -c addrbook.c
UX:acomp: ERROR: "/usr/include/stdlib.h", line 71: identifier redeclared:
system
UX:acomp: ERROR: "/usr/include/unistd.h", line 168: identifier redeclared:
renam

So this is the next glitch to iron out.

I'm running PC-Pine 3.90.  When I open the program, I get either "ICMP 
host unreachable" or "TTL exceeded in transit" errors for about thirty 
seconds or longer.  Eventually it finds the remote unix host on which my 
mail is stored.

I have no problems connecting to the same host with NCSA Telnet, or any 
Winsock-based app.  Nor are there any delays opening my inbox if I telnet 
to the unix box and run unix pine.  What's up?

Yes, you can have multiple addressbooks, but only in Pine 3.90 and later.  Go
to the Setup/Config screen and Add the addressbooks you want (including
.addressbook).

Hello everyone!

Can someone help me out? I usually use my pine program on my unix account to 
read my mail. Then one day brilliant me decided to try and use my Winsock mail 
program (WinQVT/Net v3.9) to read my university mail. Well with a 2400 baud 
modem it was taking forever, so I just rebooted my machine and when I logged 
into my unix account I discovered at my 47 emails had dissappeared!

Any one know how I can recover them?

     Anyone know where I can get a useable pcpine_w.zip?  The one I grab

Pkunzip claims "Warning! I don't know how to handle: <file>" where
<file> seems to be everything in the zip.  Is there a useable zip
around?  Am I doing something wrong with pkunzip?

     Help.  And as always any help much appreciated.

Date: 27 Oct 1994 11:55:30 -0700
Message-Id: <djolley.783284062@kaiwan009>

I have a Linux box which, among other things, is serving as a 
network server (running samba), an imap server, and a local 
news server running inn.  The workstations are PCs running W4WG 
and pcpine_w.

My first problem is that when I go to view news articles that
have been properly posted on the server, only the message part
of the article is displayed and the text of the message just
isn't there.

My second problem is that when I go to post news articles, I get
a fleeting error message accross the bottom of the pine screen
saying something about something being too old (it goes so fast
that I really can't read it).

Of course, the two problems described above are observed from the
workstation running pcpine_w.  I don't know if these two problems
are related.

Can anyone shed any light on either or both of these problems.

Thanks for any help.

Well, I for one have a lot of stuff in ../News and as postmaster often
find my self doing the equivilent of mail -f someonesmailproblemfolder.

Also there are all those /usr/spool/majordomo/*/archives.

And lost of departments like to archive special things that get stuck 
under HTML eventially.

And then there is thie other annoying bug in Pine...
every time I hit ^T to Spell it asks if some part of
"On Thu, 27 Oct 1994, Brad wrote:" is spellt correctly

In fact I really dislike the cursor starting on that first line

Every time I reply I have to hit \n\n\n\n^p^p^p^p to give my self some 
breathing room if I want to reply at the top (usual case with shot messages)
Otherwise the "On Thu, 27 Oct 1994, Brad wrote:" line gets nicely split 
into multiple lines my one of pines very nice long line trimers....

Seems like an easy mode, I do not know why every body does not have this
complaint.

Randall

BTW, I am not one of those "I use Elm, but recomend pine for the masses "
people. I have switched from many years of berkeley Mail, never liking 
the habits of MH.

We have this problem using Pine on a system which has PP as its MTA. Pine 
appears to implement the "hiding" of Bcc: via an option to sendmail (-t) 
so I wonder if the sendmail on your Solaris 5.3 system is ignoring it?

I'd doubt it.  Pine just doesn't do input filtering like that.  Check the 
man pages for your mail system.  On MMDF, for instance, this sort of 
thing can be achieved using the .maildelivery function.  Other systems 
might or might not support this sort of thing.  Periodically, other 
people mention mail filter programs which might also achieve what you want.

None of these, of course, could provide a killfile approach for Pine's 
newsreading system.

Is it possible that you download Pine from ftp.cac.washington.edu in 
ASCII mode? That would certainly cause this problem...

	Just one quick idea... when using IMAPd to access a remote
mailbox, you get prompted to enter a user ID and password, but the ID is
already placed at the cursor position. This means that if you want to
enter an alternative ID (which I, for one, usually do), then you have to
delete the ID it gives you before you can enter the one you want. How
about something like: "ID [syb3]:" so that you can still simply hit enter
to use the default ID it gives you, but you don't have to delete it if you
do want to use a different ID? It's only a very minor point, I know, but
it hit me today, and I thought it meant mentioning, so...

I'm still looking for a script that will create PGP encyphered mail from Pine.
I'm pretty sure I've seen such a thing her and am just looking for a repost.
Thanks.

Jason,
See the file
  ftp.cac.washington.edu:/mail/imap.software

ECSmail (commercial, still in testing), Mail Drop (Carl Bell at Baylor U.),
Mailstrom (Adam Treister), and TWG Pathway Messenger (commercial) are the
only Mac IMAP clients I know about.  Alas, the current releases of the last
three don't do MIME, and I haven't been able to get a copy of ECSmail yet. 
There is a development version of Mail Drop that has some MIME support, and
it appears to be under active development, so it's worth taking a look at. 

(Of course, if you want to run MachTen on your Macs, you can run Unix Pine!)

ECSmail (commercial) uses IMAP.  However I believe the Mac version is 
still in Beta Test.

One of the share/freeware mailers (I *think* it was POPmail) uses POP2, 
POP3 or IMAP.  However it uses IMAP in a POP-like way.  That is, it 
DOSN'T use IMAP to access the mailstore remotely, but simply uses it to 
download the messages to your local hard disk and delete them from the 
server in the process.  (ECSmail uses IMAP "properly").

Another FreeWare offering is Mailstrom (from sumex-aim.stanford.edu in a 
top level directory, NOT the info-mac directory tree).

And I think Mark Crispin once mentioned another mailer (which now eludes 
my memory).

If anyone knows of any others I'd be very interested (especially if they 
have modest memory requirements!)

If you setup your inbox to be anything other than the default
'/usr/spool/mail/$USER' how do you get PINE to prompt you about new mail
upon login? 

Ordinarily, it'll say "You have mail." when you connect to the host. It 
doesn't do this anymore if you change your mail path--even when you make 
the change to .pinerc!

I don't realize that how wonderful it could be in this free and democratic
country, the United States of America. For me, all the local calls are free.
No matter how long I keep on-line, my monthly premius covers it. However, I
manage to save down/up- loading time by utilizing many programs across
different platforms such as UNIX, VMS/VAX as well as DOS operating
environment.

I suggest that you use PINE program to manage mails if you have a lot emails
everyday. After you read some and delete some unwanted emails, you quit the
PINE program. And then, you run MAIL program and save all the emails into a
file. After quiting the MAIL program, you use ZIP program on UNIX system with
option -k. After zipping the mail file into a zipped file, you use binary
transfer mode to transfer this zipped file to your PC where you can use
PKUNZIP to unzip the zipped file into an ASCII/TEXT file.

        Summary of the above paragraph:
        1. Use pine program to manage emails. (BTW, can we save all the mails
into a file under PINE?)
        2. Use mail program to save all emails into a file. (just use 's *
file_name under mail prompt.)
        3. run zip with -k option under Unix prompt. (zip -k
zipped_file_name, file_name_in_step_2.)
        4. Use binary file transfer mode to transfer from Unix account to
your PC (such as kermit).
        5. delete zipped_file_name and file_name_in_step_2 from your unix
account.
        6. use pkunzip under DOS system to unzip the downloaded zipped file
into a TEXT file. (you can do this off-line or on-line such as shelling out).

As to uploading, you basically reverse the above procedure. However, you need
unzip program under UNIX system to unzip uploaded zipped file into ASCII/TEXT
file(s). PLEASE DON'T forget to include -a option with unzip otherwise you
will run into trouble.

What I introduced above can save you about 60% of downloading/uploading time
if original files are ASCII/TEXT files. Well, time is money, isn't it?

Hopefully, this can give you some ideas about how to save time and money.

Is it possible in pine to mark several messages in the inbox (or any 
folder) and print all of them in one batch with a single print command? 
Pl. respond with reference to both Pine 3.89 and .90 as we're using both 
versions on our campus.

I'm currently a PC-Pine user, but I'm looking for information on 
other DOS and Windows software supporting IMAP.  I've found the 
file containing the inventory of known software on the 
ftp.cac.washington.edu server, but unfortunately, most all of the 
software must be purchased before it can be tested.  If anyone has 
experience with DOS/Windows IMAP applications, would you please 
write to the email address below.  Comparisons with PC-Pine would 
be especially helpful.  This will give me a starting place to do 
my own comparisons.  Thanks.

With Pine 3.90 or 3.91, you can select ( ";" ) a group of messages
and then Apply Print ( "A Y" ) to them. ( Or, as I sometimes also do, 
Apply pipe ("|") to a unix command ( "enscript -2 -r -G -bSubject" ))

I don't know if there is a way in 3.89 to do that. 
Why don't you upgrade all to 3.91 ?  ( a good idea for several other
reasons - several big fixes, etc. )

What will happen to my users if I upgrade from Pine 3.89 to 3.92?  Will 
they lose their old mail, will they need to do anything?

Thanks for any info.

Pine supports MIME.  The attachment will be accessible via the 'v',
ViewAttachment command in the message view screen.  The exact syntax from
there varies slightly depending on the version of Pine...

	Hi, I am using pine again, because elm chowns my mailbox and 
can't chown it back etc.. Anyways, how can I get my .signature to be 
placed automagically at the BOTTOM of the message instead of the top?

Subject: ... 0.4 Ways to Read this Article

The best way to read this FAQ (and most other FAQs too) is to use a Web  
browser (Lynx, Mosaic, Netscape, WinWeb, Cello, etc.) to view the HTML 
version.  This will allow you to easily jump: 
   * between sections of this article
   * to an URL
   * to an RFC
   * to a man page

This and all FAQs that are crossposted to news.answers can be accessed through:
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html

This particular FAQ is at:
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/signature_finger_faq/faq.html


If you are reading the plain text version of this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest 
format and you may be able to use your newsreader or mailer to easily skip to 
a subject you're interested in.  

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split a digested article by typing G% 
  while viewing it.  This will present each digest item on a submenu.  You 
  can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key and 
  g key pressed simultaneously) to skip to the next line that begins with 
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing 
the article:

Type...                             In order to...
-------                             --------------
|                                   Pipe 
a                                   Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/Folders/faq.split  Split the digest into individual 
                                    messages and put them in a file named
                                    ~/Folders/faq.split.  (Replace ~/Folders
                                    with your folder directory.)
pine -if ~/Folders/faq.split        Use Pine to read the newly created folder.
     
For more information see the formail(1) and procmail(1) man pages.

Subject: 1.0 Automatic Signature - Basic Unix Instructions

Q: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my news articles 
   and mail messages?

A: The answer depends on your newsreader and mailer but the following 
   procedure works for many Unix newsreaders and mailers.


Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
pico ~/.signature        Use the pico editor to create a .signature file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your signature>        Note that most systems require your sig to be <= 4 
                        lines.  And it's good netiquette to make it as
                        short as possible.

<exit and save>         In Pico you use ^X to exit and answer y when asked
                        if you want to save your changes.

chmod 644 ~/.signature    Make .signature readable by all.

ls -l ~/.signature        Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x ~              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld ~                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e., 
                        drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).

ls -la ~                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.

Trn, Tin, and many other newsreaders and mailers automatically append your
.signature file (if it exists) to messages. If you use Pine, Elm, Mail, 
Emacs Mail Mode, MH, NN, or GNUS follow the additional instructions described 
below.  After you've set everything up use your mailer to mail a test message 
to yourself, and your newsreader and/or news poster (such as nnpost or Pnews) 
to post an article to a test newsgroup (use a local newsgroup and Distribution
``local'' to save bandwidth).  Note that many newsreaders and mailers add a 
line that contains ``-- '' to the top of your sig.  This is used by programs 
that automatically deal with mail or news to identify the start of the 
signature.

If you have a problem with your sig see section 1.9 on Troubleshooting.

Subject: ... 1.1 Pine 3.90 and Above
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

The default for Pine 3.90 and above is to automatically append ~/.signature 
(if it exists) to your messages.  Many people like to set the 
signature-at-bottom variable which will put your signature below both your 
message and the message you are replying to (if you've included it).  Note 
that if you are forwarding a message your signature will be put below the 
message that your write but above the forwarded message.

To change Pine's signature features:

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the signature-at-bottom feature:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the signature-at-bottom variable
   b) Type x to set/unset this variable.
4. To change the name of your signature file: 
   a) Arrow down to the signature-file line
   b) Type c for Change Value
   c) Type the path and name of the file you want to use for your
      signature.  Note that ~ means your $HOME directory.

Subject: ... 1.2 Pine 3.89 and Below
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of
Pine 3.89 often want to edit their ~/.pinerc file so that it contains 
the following:

feature-list=signature-at-bottom

If you want more than one feature in your feature-list then they need to 
be comma separated like this:

feature-list=old-growth,
	signature-at-bottom

Note that Pine's default is to use ~/.signature for your signature so you
only need to edit the following line if you are using a different file.

signature-file=

Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of Elm 
should edit their ~/.elm/elmrc file so that it contains the following:

signature = ~/.signature
sigdashes = ON

Remember to delete any # characters before any variables you want
to set.  The defaults are indicated in comment lines starting with ###.

Note that if you want to have a different signature for local mail
(i.e., addresses that don't contain a ! or @) then you can use the 
localsignature and remotesignature variables instead of the signature 
variable (which specifies one sig for all mail).

Subject: ... 1.4 Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.misc

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Regular Unix "Mail" and "mail" don't have an automatic
signature mechanism.  Many people who normally use a more deluxe
mail utility occasionally find themselves resorting to using one
of these, in which case all you need to know is this command:

	~r $HOME/.signature

This simply tells Mail to include the text of the your signature
file.

=o= If you use Mail on a regular basis you may want to use the
semi-automatic signature feature.  When you're done typing your
message, you append a signature with this command:

	~a

=o= In order for this to work, though, you need to set the
"sign" mail variable.  There are two ways to implement this
variable.  The first is to set it in a $HOME/.mailrc file with
a command like this:

	set sign="Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

If your signature is more than one line long, you can use the
C language string syntax, as in these examples:

	set sign="Jym Dyer\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

			-or-

	set sign="Jym Dyer\
	\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

=o= The disadvantage of doing this in your .mailrc file is
that you now have to maintain the text of your signature in
two places.  Another approach that avoids this problem is to set
"sign" as an environment variable in your shell startup script.
For a Bourne-compatible shell, this is done with this command:

	sign="`cat $HOME/.signature`" export sign

For a C-shell, do this:

	setenv sign "`cat $HOME/.signature`"

Subject: ... 1.5 Emacs Mail Mode

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Emacs Mail Mode is usually invoked with the "mail" or
"mail-other-window" commands (bound, respectively, to the
"C-x m" and "C-x 4 m" keys by default).  It is also invoked
from various Emacs mail and news packages.

=o= Mail Mode provides a "mail-signature" command to append
the contents of your signature file to the end of your mail
message.  This command is bound to "C-c C-w" by default,
so to insert the signature before mailing, simply type
"C-c "C-w".

=o= If you'd prefer to have your signature automatically
appended to the end of your mail message, the "mail-signature"
command can be put into your "mail-setup-hook" variable in
your $HOME/.emacs file, as in this example:

    (setq mail-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
	 (mail-signature) )))

This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.

Subject: ... 1.6 MH and Emacs MH-E
Followup-To: comp.mail.mh

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= MH doesn't have an automatic signature mechanism, but it
is so configurable that there are a number of different ways
to implement one.  Check the periodic "MH Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) with Answers" posting for details.

=o= CAVEAT:  If you use the environment variable SIGNATURE to
point to your signature file, MH will use it not as a signature,
but as your "fullname".  Even worse, if your version of MH was
built with the "UCI" option and you *don't* use the environment
variable SIGNATURE to point to another file, MH will use the
$HOME/.signature file for this purpose!  To see if your version
of MH has this behavior, enter this command:

  % send -help

And look for the string "[UCI]" in the output.

=o= There's an Emacs interface to MH, called MH-E.  It has its
own signature mechanism, which is invoked with the "mh-insert-
signature" command (bound to the "C-c C-s" keys by default).

=o= This will insert the file $HOME/.signature file by default.
If your signature file has another name (e.g., to avoid its
being used by an MH build with the "UCI" option), you can set
the "mh-signature-file-name" variable to refer to a different
file.

Subject: ... 1.7 NN
Followup-To: news.software.nn

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of NN 
should edit their ~/.nn/init file so that it contains the following:

set query-signature off
set append-signature-mail on
set append-signature-post off  

Note that the reason that you need to ``set append-signature-post off'' is 
that the news transport (such as inews) automatically appends ~/.signature 
if it exists.  If you ``set append-signature-post on'' then both nn and 
inews append your sig and you'll send out two identical sigs every time.

Copyright (c) 1994 Mike Northam

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of GNUS 
should verify that the value of the variable gnus-signature-file points to the
right place.  If you're in emacs, you can do so by evaluating the following 
expression:
gnus-signature-file
                   ^ put your cursor here and type C-x C-e

you should see "~/.signature" in the echo area.  If not, edit your
$HOME/.emacs file and add the following:
(setq gnus-signature-file "~/.signature"))
Then load your $HOME/.emacs file or merely restart emacs and the variable
should be set correctly.

Subject: ... 1.9 Troubleshooting Signature Problems

A common problem people have with .signature (and .plan, .project, and 
.forward ) files is that the permissions are not set correctly.  Check
to make sure that you have set the permissions as instructed in 1.0 above.

If you still are having problems read the man pages for your newsreader, 
news poster, or mailer and search for the string "signature".  There may be a 
variable you need to set in order for the ~/.signature to be appended.

Subject: 2.0 Finger - Basic Unix Instructions

People around the world can find out more about you by "fingering" 
you.  This is done by typing the following at a Unix prompt:

   finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

On many systems finger is linked to f so the following also works:

   f YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name


Finger displays different information on different systems.  Often
it will display your full name, your default shell, when your were
last logged on, and your ~/.plan and ~/.project files.

If you finger someone and the display takes more than one page you
can pipe the output through less (or more if you don't have less).
For example the following displays information about recent earthquakes
one page at a time.

   finger spyder@dmc.iris.washington.edu |less

Subject: ... 2.1 URLs for Fingering

In addition to using the finger or f command you can finger people
through a Web browser.  The following is a form that Doug Stevenson 
<doug+@osu.edu> created:

http://www.mps.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/finger.pl

You can also use this URL:

gopher://fully.qualified.domain.name:79/0userid
                                        ^ Note: 0 precedes the userid

Subject: ... 2.2 Changing Your Default Finger Info: chfn

On many Unix systems you can change some of your default information, 
such as your full name, by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

   chfn

If chfn is not available try "passwd -f".  If neither of these are 
available then you will need to contact your system administrator and
ask him/her to change your full name, etc.

After you have changed your information check that they are in place
by fingering yourself.  Also to see a different display of your 
information type the following at your Unix prompt:

finger

This displays a one line description of everyone currently logged on 
your system.

For more information see the chfn(1), passwd(1), and finger(1) man pages.

Subject: ... 2.3 Adding More to Your Finger Info: .plan & .project

Your ~/.project and ~/.plan files, if they exist, are displayed when you 
are fingered.  Setting these up is essentially the same as setting 
up a ~/.signature file (described in 1.0 above).

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
pico ~/.plan            Use the pico editor to create a .plan file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

chmod 644 ~/.plan       Make .plan readable by all.

ls -l ~/.plan           Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x ~              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld ~                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x.
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each.

ls -la ~                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.


If you want a .project file follow the same procedure.  Note that only the
first line of the .project is displayed (so you might as well only make
it one line!).  

To test your changes finger yourself by type each of the following at your
Unix prompt:

    finger YourUserID
    finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

To ensure that people from other systems can finger you you should ask a friend
who's not on your system to finger you too.

Subject: ... 2.4 Finding Out Who Fingers You

This is complicated - and sometimes impossible - to setup.  For details see 
the news.answers article "Unix - Frequently Asked Questions (4/7) [Frequent 
posting]", subject "4.9) How do I keep track of people who are fingering me?"  
This article is archived in a number of places including these two sites:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/unix-faq/faq/part4/faq-doc-9.html
ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/faq/part4

One easy thing that you can do to see if anyone has fingered you is
type the following at your Unix prompt:

ls -lu ~/.plan

This tells you the last time someone accessed your .plan, but it doesn't
tell you who it was.  I have this in my .login because it's interesting to 
see when the last time someone was checking on me!

[Note that under AFS (Andrew File System, a distributed filesystem),
 ls -lu ~/.plan will not work due to the fact that AFS has no notion of 
 ``atime'', or ``last accessed time''.  ( -Jeff Blaine)]

Subject: ... 2.5 Backfinger Script

Copyright (c) 1994 Janet Rosenbaum

There is a script available called, among other things, backfinger,
planner, and finger_logger (flogger or frogger, for short).  This script
makes your plan into a named pipe (just think of this as a sort of
pipe used with plumbing that opens out onto the screen of the person who
is fingering you (fred)) so that when it is accessed, it looks for a
program from which to get something to stick on fred's screen.  

The script is called when you are fingered.  At that moment, it looks to
the finger port of your unix machine and sees which machine fred is
on, logs that machine's IP number and hostname, and the date.  The script
can then execute a command to spit a plan out on fred's screen.  (One
might get creative and write a program that generates random poetry or
use the fortune program or just do "cat plan_file".)   To make fred
think you are really cool, it also tells him what machine he is
fingering you from.  

Some caveats:

	-- This program must be running at all times on your system even
	when you are logged out.  Leaving a background process like this
	annoys most sys admins to no end, especially on systems with
	high load.  Do **not** run the program unless you are sure that
	you are allowed to run background processes like this.

	-- Also, if you decide you want to stop running this program,
	remove your .plan file as soon as you kill the process.  If you
	do not do this, all finger processes for you will hang.  

	-- This script only tells you the machine fred is fingering you
	from, not his actual username.  It is nearly impossible to get
	this information except at sites with bad security.  


Given the above, I will distribute the script to those who can use it,
mostly for educational reasons.  I admit that I no longer run the
program, since my two main accounts are on rather high-load systems.
Nevertheless, I learned quite a lot from modifying these scripts and
otherwise playing with these ideas.  

Here is the web site:

 http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~jrosen/scripts/logger.src

I will also try to post this answer and the program to comp.sources.misc
at least monthly for those without web access.  (For those who have not
figured out the web, try the program lynx if you are on a vt100 or vt220
type terminal.  If you are on an xterm or hpterm, look for xmosaic.)

Note:  I am not the author of this program.  The version I distribute is 
virtually identical to that distributed by Steve Franklin.  
Here are the real authors:

Subject: 3.0 Putting Ascii Art in your Signature and Finger Files

It is considered good netiquette to keep your signature to four lines or
less.  And many news transports, like inews, will not post an article
that has a signature with more than four lines in it.  So, put large 
graphics, your life story, etc. in your finger files or in your Web pages
and point people to them in your signature.

A good source of art for your signature and finger files is the ascii art
FAQ which contains (among others) these topics:
   9  Where can I find ASCII art?
  22  How do I put an animation in my plan?
  23  How do I make a sig?
  24  How do I have my sig automatically added to my posts and email?  

The Ascii Art FAQ can be found at either of these:

Subject: ... 4.1 Pnews, RN, TRN, STRN
Followup-To: news.software.readers

The rn family of tools gets information for the Organization header from
the ORGANIZATION environment variable if it exists.  In the csh or tcsh
you can set this variable in your ~/.login with a line like this:

setenv ORGANIZATION "Your Organization Name"

After you edit your ~/.login you can establish the setting by either logging 
out and loggin back in or by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

source ~/.login


To check that the variable is set type:

printenv

After it is set, post a test message to a local test newsgroup with local
distribution to check that the Organization header is correct.

Subject: ... 4.2 Pine 3.90 and Above
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In Pine 3.90 or above you set the Organization and other headers using the 
customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the customized-hdrs variable.
   b) Type a for Add Value
   c) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
      Note that if you have set the ORGANIZATION environment variable 
      you can type: Organization: $ORGANIZATION

While reading a message that you've received you can view all the headers
by typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration
menu and set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

Note that the customized-hdrs variable is not available in Pine 3.89 and 
below.

This will add the Organization header to both news and mail messages

Is there any way to do kills for newsreading?  I assume threading may

	Ahhh, not quite right.

	ISA, the ECSmail folks, have a commercially available product now.
They have their next generation product in beta test.  The last time
I tested it I felt it needed yet another round or two before it is
ready for prime time.

Assuming you are using pine 3.90 or above....it is as simple as.

            [X]  signature-at-bottom                   

in the Configuration menu.

	You need to save the attachment to a file and then envoke
WordPerfect to display it.

	Talking to the "pine" group that doesn't care about the "elm"
filter program?  :-) :-)

	Couple of questions.

1.	Are you getting the "filtered" email?

2.	What does your .forward look like?

3.	What is your filter-rules file?

	Considering a previous thread, we all know how much you 
dislike pine.  (Wonder why you seemingly waste you time on something you
seemingly detest.)  But, if you are going to answer questions in this
group it would be refreshing if you would refrain from launching into
an unprovoked diatribe.

	Your suggestions may hold merit.  Yet, you should try something
called "constructive criticism".

I tried that method.  I privately reported this problem on 3.90.  I
received a polite reply suggesting 3.91 would be better.  Given that
3.91 was no better, and perhaps worse, I am resorting to public
embarrassment as the only available constructive method.

'#define const' is an ugly hack.  It should never appear in public
releases.  At least put 'CONST' in place of 'const' in all of your
own declarations, and control it with '#define CONST'.  Redefining a
standard keyword is a terrible practice.

Thanks for the correction, Ed.

I knew the Windows version (2.x) was in "released" status, but I hadn't 
heard that the Mac version was.  And I did get a note from the ISA folks 
yesterday confirming that 3.0 was still in testing.

Richard,
Versions of IMAP prior to IMAP4 lack an essential ingredient for 
disconnected operation, namely the "Unique IDentifier" for messages
that persists across sessions.

To date, Sun's ROAM product is the only one I know about that uses IMAP 
disconnected operation, and it was developed in parallel with the IMAP4 
spec, so it doesn't match the spec exactly yet (but will be brought into
full compliance.)

CMU already has their IMAP4 server in late Beta testing, and we will have 
one before too long, so I can't think of any reason not to base your 
project on IMAP4.  (IMAP4 is already an Internet Proposed Standard.)

	You should ask the local admin to make pc-pine available.
That will certainly help you out.

Note that this script needs extensive work to run under AIX.  I
haven't yet had a chance to play with it, but simply making the
conversions the author suggests for SysV operating systems is not
sufficient.

When I get a chance I'll try making some changes to it and get it to
work.  But if anyone has scripts that work under AIX, I'd be glad to
receive them.

Pine does MIME, and quite well.  BinHex is generally a
Macintosh-oriented encoding technique, and though WinEudora supports
it (mainly for complete compatibility with Eudora for Macintosh) the
tools necessary to use BinHex in Unix are unfortunately rather
cumbersome.

What you really need to think about is where your associate will be
finally using the files.  If he will be downloading it from his Unix
account where he runs Pine to a Macintosh, then BinHex is probably
useful.  (You can encode in BinHex, and then in MIME, of course, and
that's what you'll want to do in this case.)

Otherwise, use MIME alone without the BinHex encoding.  BinHex merely
preserves the resource fork that all Macintosh files need along with
the data fork common in all operating systems.

>If it can be done, can you tell me [specifically] how to get at the attached 
>file with pine....

When your associate views the email you have sent, Pine will inform
him that the mail he is viewing has MIME attachments.  He can then
press "V" to view or save the attachments.

When building Pine, I was getting a problem with using the -ldl flag

is only a libdl.so.1.0 file in /lib, not the libdl.sa.1.0 that ld was 
looking for. (As an error message stated at link-time.)

I removed the -ldl flag and recompiled.  It seems to have worked.  
Go figure.

Just thought I'd mention it.  I may be missing lib files, this is an

Since everyone has been so helpful, perhaps I will try another question 
-- which, I suspect, others may also have.

The printer attached to my home PC (LaserJet 4L) invariably spits out a 
blank page every time I press "Y" to print.  I am using Procomm+ in 
Windows and my artsci option is "ansi-to-printer."  I would appreciate 
any suggestions.  Thanks.

Subject: Pine on wyse30? Help?
Date: 29 Oct 94 19:09:53 GMT
Message-Id: <agulleru.783457793@cern06>


I just got a "new" dumb terminal -- a wyse30.  My "old" terminal was
a "TAB" terminal which had a nice vt100 emulation mode which let pine
work nicely.  However, I am having troubles with the wyse30.  I am
running it off an HP700 workstation, and I set the environment variable 
as wy30.  Pine seems to start O.k., but the reversing gets screwed up, and
pine oftern (particularly in the index page) scrolls up a line when it 
shouldn't, which screws up the whole screen.

Any suggestions or anyone who has the remotest experience with this?  I
have just started using pine as my major newsreader and I rely on it at
work, so I would really like it to work on my home-bound dumb terminal.

Thanks for any help anyone can give me.

Please respond by email, and I will post the findings if anyone cares.

Subject: Global Address Books
Message-Id: <mikenelCyF2Kp.JHM@netcom.com>
Date: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 04:17:12 GMT

What @*#$!! permissions should I set on the global address book and
associated lookup index file? I am using Pine 3.90 (will upgrade when I get
some free time).

I have a program that updates the global addressbook every night based on
the user list... is there anyway I can update this externally (i.e. without
someone going into Pine)? Right now it complains about not being able to
update the index file...

HELP!

There are some perl scripts around which you can use, but I find them a
little bulky, so I wrote this shellscript which does the job pretty
well.  It uses the Solaris2 version of 'echo', so if you're on a BSD
system, change any echo lines that end in \c to 'echo -n' and remove the
\c.  There might be a few \t's in the echo lines too.  These need to be
replaced with real tabs for BSD echo.

To integrate it into pine, put this script somewhere in your path (with
read & execute perms on it) and change the alternative editor to
'editpgp -i'.  Write your mail as normal, then enter the alternate
editor to handle signing and encryption.  (Just run 'editpgp' with no
args for info on command line args).  'editpgp -h' should be used with
applications like TIN which leave headers in the text to be edited.

The only bug(/feature?) with this script is that if you reply to
encrypted mail and include the message in the reply, the script doesn't
automatically decrypt the message for you.  I only wrote it because I
didn't like the perl scripts and I was bored, so I don't pretend it's
perfect, but it works pretty well and it's fast *;O)

I access Pine both from Pine/Windows 3.91 and from dial-in to the AIX host
using VT100 emulation.  Is there any way to force the Windows client to
use "saved-messages" remote folder on the AIX host rather that the default
"sentmail"?  I would like to keep the same host folder for saved mail for
both platforms.

Date: 29 Oct 1994 21:19:31 -0400
Message-Id: <38usb3$m2m@angel.cs.unc.edu>

I'm attempting to get Pine to spawn lynx when someone sends me a
World-Wide Web page in HTML via the text/html attachment type.

I dutifully put the lines

text/html; /usr/local/bin/lynx %s ; needsterminal; \
description="World-Wide Web HTML attachment"

first into my .mailcap, and then into my /etc/mailcap file.
Unfortunately, this has not worked.  Pine still displays the HTML as
regular old text and uses its own viewer.

Pine correctly starts up xv when I try to display an attached JPEG or
GIF, so I know the mailcap file is working.  Why can't I get it to
start up lynx (and/or Mosaic, Mozilla, etc.) when I receive an HTML
attachment?  Because of my job I get a lot of those, and it's a pain
to have to save it and start lynx every time.

One of my users pointed out today that the way the To: line appears on
screen and the way it is formatted in the eventual message are completely
separate.  That is, the Composer always shows the To: line with one
address per line regardless of the length of each address, but when the
message goes out, they are (correctly) formatted into as many addresses as
will fit per line.  I know this isn't a bug, but it's something I'd like
to see in 4.0 or 3.92 (which ever comes first), that the screen
presentation of the message-in-composition looks as close to the outgoing
message as possible.

Subject: [dos gets: Permission denied]???
Date: 29 Oct 1994 13:37:16 -0700
Message-Id: <djolley.783463004@kaiwan009>

Whenever I go to view a news article using pcpine, I get the
error message, "[Dos gets: Permission denied]".  Then the
header of the article is displayed; but, alas, the body of
the article is missing.  Does anyone know what the error
message, "[Dos gets: Permission denied]" means.  I think this
is the clue to solving my problem.

Just for the record, my configuration is a Linux box acting as
a network file/imap server running samba.  The workstations are
PCs running DOS/W4WG and pcpine_w.

I would certainly appreciate hearing from anyone who can advise
me on this problem.  I think I finally just about have this
thing working.

Thanks for any help.

If you're thinking of the 'you have new mail' message when you login,
that's done by the login program itself, not pine.  Typically the
login program has the 'standard' mailbox name hardwired into the
executable.

Some shells have a MAILPATH environment variable that might give you
the functionality you're looking for.

I've just started using Pine and I would like to send messages to

.addressbook  in Pine to have them all receive my message, without each
of them receiving each others email address.

Where did you repost it?  I'm sorry, I'm new to this newsgroup and I've seen
your earlier requests for something that will let PGP & Pine work together
but seem to have missed your repost of the script.  Any chance of rereposting
it?

    I use mhl for this.  Have a look at the mhl man page (I've appended
    the first 3 pages of it below).  Its easy to use, very flexible, and
    capable of more than you currently need.

                       --jrh

------------------------------------------------------------------------

     MHL(1)                         AIX                         MHL(1)



     NAME
          mhl - produce formatted listings of MH messages

     SYNOPSIS
          /usr/local/lib/mh/mhl [-bell] [-nobell] [-clear] [-noclear]
               [-folder +folder] [-form formfile] [-length lines]
               [-width columns] [-moreproc program] [-nomoreproc]
               [files ...] [-help]

     DESCRIPTION
          Mhl is a formatted message listing program.  It can be used
          as a replacement for more (1) (the default showproc ).  As
          with more, each of the messages specified as arguments (or
          the standard input) will be output.  If more than one mes-
          sage file is specified, the user will be prompted prior to
          each one, and a <RETURN> or <EOT> will begin the output,
          with <RETURN> clearing the screen (if appropriate), and
          <EOT> (usually CTRL-D) suppressing the screen clear.  An
          <INTERRUPT> (usually CTRL-C) will abort the current message
          output, prompting for the next message (if there is one),
          and a <QUIT> (usually CTRL-\) will terminate the program
          (without core dump).

          The `-bell' option tells mhl to ring the terminal's bell at
          the end of each page, while the `-clear' option tells mhl to
          clear the scree at the end of each page (or output a
          formfeed after each message).  Both of these switches (and
          their inverse counterparts) take effect only if the profile
          entry moreproc is defined but empty, and mhl is outputting
          to a terminal.  If the moreproc entry is defined and non-
          empty, and mhl is outputting to a terminal, then mhl will
          cause the moreproc to be placed between the terminal and mhl
          and the switches are ignored.  Furthermore, if the `-clear'
          switch is used and mhl's output is directed to a terminal,
          then mhl will consult the $TERM and $TERMCAP envariables to
          determine the user's terminal type in order to find out how
          to clear the screen.  If the `-clear' switch is used and
          mhl's output is not directed to a terminal (e.g., a pipe or
          a file), then mhl will send a formfeed after each message.

          To override the default moreproc and the profile entry, use
          the `-moreproc program' switch.  Note that mhl will never
          start a moreproc if invoked on a hardcopy terminal.

          The `-length length' and `-width width' switches set the
          screen length and width, respectively.  These default to the
          values indicated by $TERMCAP, if appropriate, otherwise they
          default to 40 and 80, respectively.

          The default format file used by mhl is called mhl.format
          (which is first searched for in the user's MH directory, and
          then sought in the /usr/local/lib/mh directory), this can be
          changed by using the `-form formatfile' switch.

          Finally, the `-folder +folder' switch sets the MH folder
          name, which is used for the messagename: field described
          below.  The envariable $mhfolder is consulted for the
          default value, which show, next, and prev initialize
          appropriately.

          Mhl operates in two phases: 1) read and parse the format
          file, and 2) process each message (file).  During phase 1,
          an internal description of the format is produced as a
          structured list.  In phase 2, this list is walked for each
          message, outputting message information under the format
          constraints from the format file.

          The mhl.format form file contains information controlling
          screen clearing, screen size, wrap-around control, tran-
          sparent text, component ordering, and component formatting.
          Also, a list of components to ignore may be specified, and a
          couple of special components are defined to provide added
          functionality.  Message output will be in the order speci-
          fied by the order in the format file.

          Each line of mhl.format has one of the formats:

               ;comment
               :cleartext
               variable[,variable...]
               component:[variable,...]

          A line beginning with a `;' is a comment, and is ignored.  A
          line beginning with a `:' is clear text, and is output
          exactly as is.  A line containing only a `:' produces a
          blank line in the output.  A line beginning with component:
          defines the format for the specified component, and finally,
          remaining lines define the global environment.

          For example, the line:

               width=80,length=40,clearscreen,overflowtext="***",overflowoffset=5

          defines the screen size to be 80 columns by 40 rows, speci-
          fies that the screen should be cleared prior to each page,
          that the overflow indentation is 5, and that overflow text
          should be flagged with ***.

          Following are all of the current variables and their argu-
          ments.  If they follow a component, they apply only to that
          component, otherwise, their affect is global.  Since the
          whole format is parsed before any output processing, the
          last global switch setting for a variable applies to the
          whole message if that variable is used in a global context
          (i.e., bell, clearscreen, width, length).

               variable       type       semantics
               width          integer    screen width or component width
               length         integer    screen length or component length
               offset         integer    positions to indent component:
               overflowtext   string     text to use at the beginning of an
                                         overflow line
               overflowoffset integer    positions to indent overflow lines
               compwidth      integer    positions to indent component text

          To specify the value of integer-valued and string-valued
          variables, follow their name with an equals-sign and the
          value.  Integer-valued variables are given decimal values,
          while string-valued variables are given arbitrary text
          bracketed by double-quotes.  If a value is suffixed by /G or
          /L, then its value is useful in a global-only or local-only
          context (respectively).

          A line of the form:

              ignores=component,...

          specifies a list of components which are never output.

          The component MessageName (case-insensitive) will output the
          actual message name (file name) preceded by the folder name
          if one is specified or found in the environment.  The format
          is identical to that produced by the `-header' option to

Subject: Bug (ID XO2CG): Printing to "Attached-to-ANSI"

Good folks,

I am still having the same problem that I reported a few days ago -- 
namely, my printing of PINE 3.91 postings "hangs" after about a page and 
one-half.  I have checked the "character-start-stop" (the exact 
configuration command-title escapes me just now), and have tried the 
Control-Q switch upon "hanging," but nothing works.  I had none of this 
trouble with 3.89.  My printer has 1.5 MBs of memory, so that is not the 
problem.  When the print-out "hangs," I can "force" more data into the 
printer by pressing the space-bar, but, after another page or so, this 
procedure also becomes useless, with the printer's "print" light flashing 
as though more data is being fed into the printer, but with no further 
printing being done.  I finally have to escape from the printing 
process.  

After the first page and one-half, when the "hanging" begins, the 
remainder that I am able to "force" (about another page) has an uppercase 
"K" preceding every line, and in addition each line is somewhat garbled.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

Many thanks,

Randy

I am looking for a way to select a set of articles and save them all into
a single file.  Is there a way to do this in PINE 3.91?  I've tried
flagging them and "E"xporting, but it appears to want to export only one
file.  I've also tried to "F"orward the messages, but that doesn't work. 
Is there a way to do it?

You can Apply ( "A" ) any other command ( "S"ave, "E"xport, "D"elete, 
"Y" (print), "|" (pipe), etc... )  to a group of selected messages, which 
will do that command on all of them. 

Note that for Pipe and Print, all of the messages are send in one stream to
the printer or program on the other end of the pipe. For Pipe, this is what
you need, but for printing, Pine doesn't separate the messages quite as
clearly as I would like. ( Although, it is nice that it does strip out the
"unnecessary" header lines. ) It would be nice if there were an option in
the Printer Setup, to set an optional message separator string on Print, 
so you could force messages to start on a new page, or perhaps print 
a line of of dashes or other delimiters between each message.

Christopher,

	You may want to try saving them to a newly created mailbox/mail 
folder, since all mail folders are just flat files.
	Using 3.91, you can ;SI (apply a select to the important flagged 
messages) and then AS (apply a save-to-folder).

  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions is an important standard for
  conveying pictures, audio, formatted data, and ordinary text in email.
  It describes many data types; many Unix, Windows, and Mac mail
  programs implement MIME to varying degrees.
  
  Dave Crocker, a noted internetworking consultant, will give a status
  report on MIME and its implementations.  He will address questions
  like: What's the real purpose of MIME and its data types?  If I want
  to develop an application that uses email, can I rely on my customers
  having MIME?  When will the email I receive be enriched via MIME?  How
  can I send MIME-enriched mail to others?

Winsock.dll is part of the TCP/IP implementation and not of pcpine_w or any
other winsock based client. I have tried it with PC TCP 2.3 & 3.0=20
(commercial) and Trumpet winsock (shareware from ftp.trumpet.com.au).

Hello everyone

I connect to the site that holds my email via a slip connection, this 
connection is dialup.
I would like pine on my home system to use the inbox on the mail system.
I know you are supposed to use the in-box-path in your .pinerc file but 
can someone tell me what the format of this is supposed to look like
eg the host is werple.apana.org.au and my mail file on this host is 
/var/mail/guardian

Thanks for any assistance.

	You're half way there! You need to "A"pply the "E"xport command
(i.e. A followed by E), and "A F" for forwarding a number of messages.

The easiest way is to do this is to read to documentation.

That's where I've been having trouble too - I get to the folder index 
screen (in this case my INBOX folder) and press the semi-colon .. then 
I'm told that ';' is not enable for this screen.  How do I select 
multiple messages for those aggregate operations ... from the folder 
index screen?  Like, for example, how do I select all messages from one 
individual?

I think you need to 'Enable Aggregate Command Set' in the Setup/
Configure menu. That will enable Select, Apply and Zoom. ( when
my .pinerc file was updated by 3.9x, it turned this on automatically
for me, probably because I had "old-growth" set in 3.89. ) 

  Once it is enabled, just try ";" - it will prompt you for selection
options. If you then do a Zoom, it will display only selected messages.

	Some people may wish you hadn't asked that question.....care to
comment Neil?  :-) :-)

	Anyway, in the makefile.sol file you should find the line that
reads CFLAGS= ....... and add -Dconst= to the line.  It should now
compile.

	How naive can you be?  :-)

	The easiest way is to ignore the copious documentation and whatever
FAQ that is available.  If ever you have a question and can't come up with
a solution after a nano-second of thought all you need do is post it to
a newsgroup.  There is no need to look back on a newgroup to see if someone
else has already asked the same question.  Some fool is bound to feel sorry 
for you and answer your question.

	Regardless of what is said about netequitte(sp?) and common
sense there will always be the new kid on the block who hasn't gotten
the message.  Besides, if people read the documentation and didn't ask
the same questions over and over again there would be fewer posts to
weedout and one less thing to be sarcastic about at 7:30am.

	Regards,

There are two versions of cc on our system. The one that works is the BSD
compatibility version. (It is called cc.old on our system.) All I had to do 
was make one change in build:

     makeargs="CC=cc.old"
