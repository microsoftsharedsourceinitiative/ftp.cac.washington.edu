Here's the help I received from David Miller at Washington.  It did the 
trick for me ... with a few minor changes like adding casts:

>To build either 3.89 or 3.91 on Solaris 2.3, you need to add "-Dconst="  to
>the CFLAGS line in pine/makefile.sol.  Then it should compile with only the

Bear in mind that I'm using Sun's SPARCcompiler C - that may cause 
your/my mileage to vary.

To all:

We use Pine 3.87 (until 3.91 is available) on a SparcServer running SunOS 
4.1.1 I have noticed that there are a lot of temp files in /usr/tmp/ All 
of them look like this:

-rw-------  1 mrbrady         0 Oct  7 16:08 pinesend002737

Most are of 0 bytes. Are those safe to delete? What about the other 
messages? Does sendmail process them? The above file was created on Oct 
7, and just rebooted the system 4 days ago. I guess they are not 
automatically removed. Any help would be grand.

	First, pine 3.91 is available from ftp.cac.washington.edu, so you
may now upgrade.

	Second, those tmp files may be removed.  As you know pine 3.87 is
rather old....there may have been a problem with the files not always
being removed.  I frankly don't remember.

Subject: beginning of messages/parsing
Content-Length: 1035

Hello all!
I've recently begun using my Sun/Solaris 2.3 - this may be an issue I need to
take up elsewhere but thought I'd start here.

On my old OS (SCO Xenix), I could process a mail file with one of my own 
apps - I knew that messages begin with "From ".  Knowing this, I could break
a mail file down to its individual messages and work with them from there.

Then, I moved to my Sun/Solaris 2.3 box and found that that is no longer true.
I thought the problem was mine until I received a couple of messages that
included several imbedded "From "'s - they were majordomo list logs.  Well,
mailx could tell that there was a total of 3 messages, where the messages
included many other messaages.  Pine, on the other hand could not - and parsed
them out as several smaller messages.  

What's the deal on mailbox parsing?  How can I tell where one message begins
and one ends?  Should I cross post this message to another list that discusses
Sun or are others of you finding the same "problem"?

How does one go about recieving newsgroups through Pine? I'd like to 
access the jvnc.net server - I think.  At least, my school USED to have a 
connection with jvnc, but do I need one to recieve news?

I'm only interested in ONE newsgroup, anyway, and I'd like to get it 
through the mail on a daily basis, if at all possible. Thanks for any info.

	The problem is Sun's twisted notion that the "Content-Length:"
field is a valid field.   You have several options:

	One is to adopt a recent suggestion from Mark Crispin:

     "Please get a copy of our sendit tool (available on our FTP server), or
some similar mail delivery tool that does not depend upon the highly bogus
Solaris ``Content-Length'' header to skip over message texts with embedded
mbox headers.  Use it in place of the mail delivery tool (usually /bin/mail)
as called by sendmail."

	I'm not familiar with SUN's sendmail implementation or the /bin/mail
program on their system....but you can also try adding the "E" flag to the
local mailer definition in the sendmail.cf file.  This flag is designed to
Escape lines beginning with "From " in the message with an ">" sign.

	I think you are slightly confused as the access of newsgroups
through pine.

	With pine you have the ability to access newsgroups through a
protocol known as NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) or (maybe?)
IMAP.  Since I'm not sure if the IMAP method is supported...I'll only
speak to the NNTP way.

	If jvnc.net supports NNTP...and if...it is configured to allow
access to your host you should be able to configure the nntp-server=
variable in the Configuration to point to jvnc.net and then go through
the process of "subscribing" to the newsgroup that you are interested in
reading.

	The various help menus of pine give a fairly easy to follow
directions on how to configure the NNTP server and how to subscribe
to a newsgroup.

	The thing is...you won't be getting the newsgroup as email.  In
these cases pine acts in a fashion similiar to tin or the other newsreaders.
It trys to keep a consistant interface so you don't have to know one
set of keystrokes for news and a different set for mail.  Since I was not
much of a newsreader until pine gave me access...it was a snap for me
to figure out the subtle differences keystrokes used in email and the
same keystrokes used in newsreading.  Others will disagree....to them
I simply say it proves the saying, "Can't teach an old dog new tricks.".

	There are some newsgroups, such as pine, that exist as both a
mailing list and newsgroup.  They are bi-directionally gatewayed.  You
may do yourself a favor by asking around to find out if the one that
interests you is also a mailing list.  Some people prefer getting their
news as mailing lists.....

	Good Luck.....

	I think you are slightly confused as the access of newsgroups
through pine.

	With pine you have the ability to access newsgroups through a
protocol known as NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) or (maybe?)
IMAP.  Since I'm not sure if the IMAP method is supported...I'll only
speak to the NNTP way.

	If jvnc.net supports NNTP...and if...it is configured to allow
access to your host you should be able to configure the nntp-server=
variable in the Configuration to point to jvnc.net and then go through
the process of "subscribing" to the newsgroup that you are interested in
reading.

	The various help menus of pine give a fairly easy to follow
directions on how to configure the NNTP server and how to subscribe
to a newsgroup.

	The thing is...you won't be getting the newsgroup as email.  In
these cases pine acts in a fashion similiar to tin or the other newsreaders.
It trys to keep a consistant interface so you don't have to know one
set of keystrokes for news and a different set for mail.  Since I was not
much of a newsreader until pine gave me access...it was a snap for me
to figure out the subtle differences keystrokes used in email and the
same keystrokes used in newsreading.  Others will disagree....to them
I simply say it proves the saying, "Can't teach an old dog new tricks.".

	There are some newsgroups, such as pine, that exist as both a
mailing list and newsgroup.  They are bi-directionally gatewayed.  You
may do yourself a favor by asking around to find out if the one that
interests you is also a mailing list.  Some people prefer getting their
news as mailing lists.....

	Good Luck.....

Here's the readme for a csh script I work on from time to time.  Send 
your public key to 
			deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu
if you want it...

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<

(1) Extract and install mkpgp.

At your Unix prompt, run the command:

   uudecode NameOfTheFileYouArePresentlyReading

An executable script, mkpgp, will be extracted.  Move the
the script into a directory on your path.  One such directory is
usually "bin" in your home directory.  Examine the leading names of 
your path variable (echo $path) if you are unsure.  In the unlikely 
event that you don't have access to a directory for executables, 
see * below.

Run the Unix command:

   rehash

*or* logout and login.  Either of these will make your system
"aware" of the new command "mkpgp."


(2) Configure Pine for mkpgp.

Set the alternate editor to mkpgp:

# Editor to use in place of Pine's internal composer, Pico
editor=mkpgp

	* Or use an absolute path. E.g., editor=/yourHomeDir/mkpgp

Force Pine to put your signature at the bottom:

# Use old style forward/reply with new text and signature below included text
# Old-style-reply is obsolete, use signature-at-bottom in feature-list
old-style-reply=yes
[...]
# The feature-list that is in effect when you are running Pine
[...]
# of the features is no-, that is, off.
feature-list=old-growth,
        signature-at-bottom

(3) Set the environment variable "PGPPATH" in a login file.

Put a line like:
	setenv PGPPATH ~/.pgp
in .cshrc if you use c-shell.


(4) Run and configure mkpgp.

This part can be done from the command line or Pine.

The first time you run mkpgp it will create $PGPPATH/mkpgprc, and $PGPPATH/tmp.
You are immediately given a chance to edit $PGPPATH/mkpgprc. Set the variables
to your liking.  Clearly, the environment variable "PGPPATH" must be defined 
before you can run mkpgp.  mkpgp comes to a screeching halt if it is not set.


Default mkpgprc:

#
# Configuration file for mkpgp.
#
# Set the real alternate editor. Pine 3.9.x users, see IMPLICITALTEDIT.
#
set MKPGPEDITOR = none
#
# Does Pine use the alternate editor implicitly?  Unless you change 
# MKPGPEDITOR to something other than "none" when IMPLICITALTEDIT = yes,
# mkpgp will try to use "pico -z -t".  I can only hope that you have it...
#
set IMPLICITALTEDIT = no                  # (no/yes)
#
# When IMPLICITALTEDIT = yes and Pine is configured to include-header-in-reply,
# mkpgp can try to pick the right keyid (e-mail address) from the "From:" line.
# Whatever it finds is presented as the default recipient id instead of "none".
# Entering other keys will replace the default. Entering + will let you add to 
# the default.  Entering - will delete the default so that the message is not
# encrypted. See "Replacement lists" below.
# 
set AUTORECRYPT = no                      # (no/yes)
#
# Ask to encrypt the message. yes = ask with a default of yes, no = ask

#

#

#

(If you use Pine v3.9.x, 
 
		[X]  enable-alternate-editor-implicitly
                [X]  include-header-in-reply 
		[X]  include-text-in-reply

with

set IMPLICITALTEDIT = yes
set ASKTORUN = no
set AUTORECRYPT = yes 

in mkpgprc is pretty slick.  mkpgp runs between Pine and your editor to 
decrypt the message. On exiting the editor, mkpgp asks to run again (with 
"no" as the default) to re-encrypt the message.  It's almost seamless.)

(4) Usage.

My first axiom: I detest pecking on keyboards...

==========
Encryption
==========

If you use the defaults:

Compose a message then invoke the alternate editor. mkpgp will ask:

	Include encrypted attachment(s)? [n]
	
At every prompt, simply hit the <return> key if you want what's in [].  
(This can be important; don't give mkpgp needless input. Remember my first
axiom.)

Enter y and hit <return> if you want to include attachments in the message
text (thereby encrypting them).  A primitive browser will let you navigate
the file system to attach files and dirs.  You select attachments by number.  
Hit <return> on a blank line to move up one directory.  Selecting a
single directory is ambiguous (since you are navigating the directories
with the same browser), so you are further prompted to
"Enter or Attach? [e]" it.  Hit <return> to enter, enter "a" and hit 
<return> to attach it. If a directory is a member of a list, mkpgp attaches 
it is.  After collecting all the attachments, enter f and hit <return>. 
$PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is listed and you are  a given a chance change it.
If you elect to do so, mkpgp will cd to $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach and start a
shell. Do what you will, and use "exit" or <control> d to exit and return to
mkpgp.

mkpgp copies attachments into $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach.  When you exit the 
browser, $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is tar'ed, compress, uuencoded and 
appended to the message text as ascii. $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is then 
removed (*not* wiped and deleted).

Next, pgp will show a public key ring and mkpgp will ask:

	Enter recipient key id(s) [none].

List the recipient key id(s) separated by blanks, or hit <return> if you 
don't want to encrypt the message.

Next, pgp will show $PGPPATH/secring.pgp secret key ring and mkpgp will ask:

	Sign the message with which secret key? [n]

y <return> selects the key defined by MyName in $PGPPATH/config.txt.  You can 
select an alternate by giving a keyid (If you enter n, mkpgp will look for a 
key with n in it. Bad news...  Remember my first axiom.  Also, beware of the 
ENCRYPTTOSELF option if you select an alternate key.)

If you elect to sign the message, pgp will request a pass phrase. pgp goes
to work on the message. There is a 5 second delay when pgp is finished so you can 
see what happened.  After that you should be looking at the message in the Pine 
window. Send it.  If ENCRYPTTOSELF=on, you can decrypt the copy of the message in 
sent-mail.  If ENCRYPTTOSELF=off and you didn't include yourself as a recipient,
you might as well delete it.

The actual pgp command options used by mkpgp are:

pgp -setw $LEGALKLUGE +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF +armor=on +keepbinary=off\
+armorlines=0 +tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $keys $sign

pgp -satw $LEGALKLUGE +clearsig=on +keepbinary=off +tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $sign

pgp -etw $LEGALKLUGE +pubring=$MKPGPPUBRING +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF\ 
+armor=on +keepbinary=off +armorlines=0 +tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $keys

$1 is /tmp/pico.xxxx, $keys is the list of keys, $sign is the key id used 
to sign the message.  If  LEGALKLUGE = yes in $PGPPATH/mkpgprc then LEGALKLUGE 
is reset  to "+ce=0 +le" and mkpgp exploits a bug in pgp2.6[.1] that creates 
cyphertext readable by 2.3a.  If LEGALKLUGE = no in $PGPPATH/mkpgprc, then
LEGALKLUGE is reset to " " (thus ignored).  There are several other calls to 
pgp to wipe and delete temporary files.

==========
Decryption
==========

The only way to decrypt using mkpgp is in a reply or forward since that is your
only access to the alternate editor.

If mkpgp finds a line beginning with one of the the strings:

                    -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
                    > -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
                    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
                    > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- 
                    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
                    > -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
                        

it will strip the leading "> " and run the command:

	pgp +force +interactive=on +keepbinary=off 

attempting to mimic the forward/reply behavior of Pine.  

If, along the way, a line beginning with:

                  begin 600 mkpgpAttach.tar.Z

is found in the message text, mkpgp will list the attachments and 
ask to unpack them.  You you choose to do so,  the mkpgpAttach directory 
is moved into $PGPPATH (renaming if needed).  The mkpgpAttach.tar.Z file 
is wiped & deleted. You are given a chance to examine/delete the attachments
(exit as before).

Can anyone please help me.

My girlfriend is a systems administrator for a financial
firm, they currently have Windows and MSMail.

They are thinking about installing some redirection 
software onto the network to deal with rerouting mail
for holidays and such.

Can anyone give me tales of real life use of different
packages that they have used...  or grapevine news
about what you have heard...  Please mail me back 
directly :    cb92dge@brunel.ac.uk

Thanks a lot in advance for you help.

Dom

P.S. They have seen WinRules and C2C - any info about
these two would be greatly appreciated.

Use it.  You will need to mark it executable (chmod +x) and will probably
want to rename it, but other than that it should be ready to run...

Subject: Pine running wild when user's session disconnected
Date: 2 Nov 1994 00:56:46 -0500
Message-Id: <3979mu$ha7@romulus.ncsc.mil>

I've noticed pine processes associated with users whose sessions
ended with either a non-zero return code or a hangup signal running
wild, i.e. apparently looping to no particular end, and eating CPU time
(some hours after the login session had been terminated).

I've got a wild guess that where it is looping is line 392 of
pine3.91/pine/ttyin.c, i.e.:

         if(errno == EINTR)
           return(NO_OP_COMMAND);

Now, since errno is *not* cleared by successful calls, there is currently
no way to know whether this test is being satisfied as a consequence of
the read() call on line 381, that is:

     res = read(STDIN_FD, &c, 1);

If my wild guess is right, adding:

     errno = 0;

*before* the read() call in line 381 should take care of it.

Now for the bottom line:

1. has anyone had similar problems?

2. any comments on the possible explanation/fix?

FYI, this is happening on a system running DG/UX ("./build d-g").
And the printer problems are happening there too, not that I think
that relates to the problem I'm bringing up.

If you have Pine 3.90 or higher you can set default-compose-hdrs to 
contain Fcc.  It will default to being filled in with saved-messages
but then you can edit it when you want to ``folder carbon copy''
a different folder.  Here's what I have in my .pinerc:

# Only show these headers (by default) when composing messages
default-composer-hdrs=To,
        Cc,
        Subject,
        Fcc


Hope this helps,
Nancy

Your novice users should see very little difference and there should not be
any problem with old mail.

If you are using an older IMAPd, it will not recognize an addressbook file as
a folder.  The IMAPd from the Pine 3.91 distribution should open it as a
read-only pseudo-folder.  Pine cannot make use of a remote addressbook as an
addressbook unless you mount it via NFS or some such.

It sounds like you have a keyboard mapping problem in your terminal emulator. 
The shift-space is getting mapped to an 8-bit value (SP with 8th bit set). 
this is triggering Quoted-Printable encoding, which is what your recipients
with non-MIME aware mail readers are seeing.

There's an option for that in .pinerc (on my copy, at least).  Add

Yes, paths are relative to the user's home directory.  You can specify 
absolute paths though...

I'm interested in setting up PC Pine clients with a VMS Mail Server.  I

mail and security.  I'm planning on using MS Windows 3.1 clients with the 
Trumpet IP stack running also with DECNet.

Where can I get a FAQ that would show me all the parts I'll need and how 
they operate together.  Furthermore, who out there has sucessfully set up 
and operates PC Pine clients from a VMS mail server?  Tips/Tricks/Problems?

Thanks for your help.

	Does anyone know why Pine 3.89 complains about a cross device 
link?   We're using Solaris 2.1 (we're obsolete in everything!).  Will
updating to 3.90 or 3.91 solve our problem.  I can't see why a happily

I tried to build pine using the command "build sv4"
The pico, imapd and mtest parts were built, but the make died during the
pine build with the following error message.

	cc -DSV4   -g -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"SV4\" -c addrbook.c

make: fatal error.

Does anyone know how to modify the sv4 makefile for use with unixware?

In your address book create an alias with all the email addresses for your 
class. Once you have done that, you can compose messages from the address book 
to the appropriate alias.

Is there any chance or way UUENCODED files can
be extracted transparently in PINE?

Pine is great for transparently extracting MIME
files for novice to casual UNIX users.  

Though - when a person emails a UUENCODED file 
(as that is all their email software supports) to a
PINE user on our site - mayhem breaks out.
Usually resulting in a tearful phone call
to who ever is on the console.

(I don't remember seeing this on the FAQ files?)

Thanks in advance,

Lachlan.

Pine became a full newsreader including posting

Currently, the machine that I want to access via the IMAPd daemon does not
allow rsh access (rlogin type) because the sysadmin sees it as a security
hole too big to justify.

Any way around this?

Also... I've got my own machine set up, but I didn't configure IMAPd for
it when installing pine... is there an easy way to do this and does the
archive contain sample imapd.conf files? 

Thanks.

I just got onto this list. I have a couple of questions: I notice that 
Pine 2.91 is being used; we are still on 2.89. Is there a significant 
advantage in upgrading? The real question: I would like to be able to 
type and send and receive the accented German letters (two dots over a 
"o", "u", "a" and their upper-case equivalents, plus the beta-like 
s-sound. In NuPOP I can include an ASCII file which contains these 
characters, but I can't type them in either NuPOP or Pine. Changing to the 
DEC Multinational set did not help either. Any suggestions? Also: Have 
the screen editing facilities of Pine been improved? ^D and ^L is a pain!
Thanks,

This sounds like a problem with your VMS IMAP server.  Please contact the 
vendor of that server and report the problem.  Most likely, the error is 
in the returned ``INTERNALDATE''.

This is what I did when building Pine 3.91:


SOLARIS 2.3
-----------

. Edited pine/osdep/os-sv4.h and made 3 changes (original file in .orig):

  . Set the locations of the pine global configuration files;
  . De-commented the setting of ANSI;
  . Commented the null definition of "const".
  
. Edited pine/makefile.sol and made one change (original file in .orig):   
  
  . Commented out the compiler flag setting for -g -DDEBUG.
  . De-commented the compiler flag setting for -O. 
  
. Typed "build sol" at top level. 

It all built straight away, seemingly successfully. There were a number of 
compiler warnings, some about changes of comparisons for ANSI semantics, and 
some for apparent differences of argument types to some routines. These do not 
seem to matter.

Press v to go to the attachment index, and pipe the attachment to
"ghostview -".  Pine3.91 groks .mailcap where you could write

application/postscript; ghostview %s

When I try going into the SENT-MAIL folder I get this message

Hi.  Quick question.

November just arrived and now I have another folder in Pine.  It's the 
mail that I sent in October.  Is there any way to export that whole 
folder (rather than saving each file individually)?  I would like to put 
it all onto a disk (or two), rather than leaving it all at Netcom.

Thanks!

Following my request for help with building pine3.91 under UnixWare 
1.1.2, I received the following responses in email. Thanks to John and 
Jeff, pine is now running on my system and the users are happy. If anyone 
out there is still using pine3.89, I'd suggest upgrading to 3.91 as soon 
as you can.

Thanks all,
Mike.

	I was just messing around with pine.  I modified pine/osdep/os-sv4.h,
uncommenting the line 

	#define ANSI,
	
and commented out the line

	#define const
	
pine then compiled, but further modifications are needed to define
the proper mail transfer agent.  I believe pine expects /usr/lib/sendmail.
UnixWare has sendmail in /usr/ucblib, and the standard version as shipped
by Novell is broken.  I guess there's also a ptf with the latest version
of sendmail somewhere on ftp.novell.com.

This would work if you use tenex format with a delivery program such as
tmail (available on our FTP server) to write to it. 

There is a general misunderstanding as to exactly what, and why, read-only
is with the standard UNIX mbox format.  Read-only in mbox format means 
that Pine has taken an in-memory snapshot of that folder.  After it takes 
the snapshot of the folder, it no longer looks at the disk.  Messages can 
be deleted and expunged, and Pine would not know.

The fact that messages can be deleted and expunged, or that messages can
be moved around (because of writing the Status:/X-Status:) header, means
that a Pine process can not update its in-memory snapshot, unless it was
the entity that did the manipulation of the folder.  If some other process
sloshes messages around, Pine no longer knows where anything is in the
file.  The only way to reconcile is to toss out everything it may have
known about the file and read it all in again; that's just about what you
do when you quit Pine and restart it. 

There is a lock that says ``I declare that I may slosh messages around in
the folder.'' If a Pine process has this lock, it is called ``normal
access''.  If not, it is called ``read-only access'' and it punts on 
trying to keep track of what the disk copy is doing.

Tenex format exploits certain technical aspects to permit many Pine 
processes to read the folder at the same time, yet each is able to 
reconcile the in-Pine state with the disk (Tenex format does not require 
a complete snapshot of the folder, just pointers to where all the 
messages are).  So, using Tenex format, you can have lots of people 
reading the same file, and seeing changes as they happen, even if they 
only have read permission to the file.

The downside to Tenex format is that it is incompatible from the ordinary 
UNIX mbox format, so other tools such as Elm can not read folders in this 
format.

Message-Id: <sui.1.2EB6A176@ornl.gov>

A user encounters this problem from time to time in version 3.89, 3.90, and 
3.91.

The user was forwarding a message and at the end of that message were messages 
apparently just hit her INBOX.  These incoming messages looked as if they were 
appended to the forwarded message.

When this happened yesterday, the user went ahead sending the forwarded 
message.  The forwarded message was fine, i.e. the incoming messages were not 
in it.  But, these incoming messages were not in the INBOX or any folder.  
They disappeared!

It happened again this morning. This time, these incoming messages went with 
the forwarded message but they were correctly placed in the INBOX.

Has anyone reported this problem before?  Is there a fix?

I am having a strange thing happen to me and just know that there is
someone on the Net with an answer.  

I am able to attach a Word Perfect file to an e-mail message and send it
to a secretary here on the same campus but when I try to do the same thing
to another of our campuses the attachment appears as if it had uunencoded.
 It is totally useless.  Any thoughts on what the devil's going on.  

Frustrated in Brampton.

I do like the pine -f folder behavior.  I use pine -f $PWD/folder for
reading mailboxes in the current directory.  pine -f ./folder would be
nicer.  The use-current-dir option doesn't enable it, either.

Perhaps it could search both places.

	It is perfectly valid, your friend just needs MIME-compliant

	No, and you can't alter the behaviour without
	editing the source, and compiling..

	PINE sends all 8-bit chars in Quoted-Printable format,
	that is "=HH".

Message-Id: <1994Nov2.134008.18722@rockyd>
Date: Wed, 2 Nov 94 13:40:08 EST

I have started using the IMAP access method with pine-3.91 both under
Unix and Winsock. While from Unix I use the pre-authentication, I want
to specify the password each time I use it from my PC. 

The problem is, that PC_Pine never asks me about an username and a
password. And it tells me, that access is denied, when I try to expand
the folder. BTW, the Unix version also denied me access without asking
me anything, until I turned rsh access on.

I have read both the tech notes and the README files, as well as all
help of variables and config options, but I didn't see where is this
documented.

So, my question is "How to use IMAP non-pre-authentication access from
PC_Pine?"

Hello ! I am using PINE 3.91 (I love it!) and I have 
a problem. Is there a way to know if a mail or news 
folder is empty before entering it ?

Thanx for your help !

Well, is there a directory named mail already?  What are its 
permissions?  Or is there a file named mail already there?  If the 
latter, then certainly Pine can't make a folder there.  Sorry to ask the 
obvious questions first, but there might be gold in them thar directories.

Three:

a) Set up an alias. A little known feature of 3.90/3.91 is that there is 
a 4th field in each alias which is precisely the default Fcc: for that 
alias, so each persons mail will go to the right place.

b) Using Setup Config set the default-composer-headers to include fcc, 
then the standard fcc is displayed when composing and can be overwritten 
to whatever is required (^K then new value)

c) without either of those: when composing and in the headers type ^R 
(Rich Headers) upon which the fcc will be displayed; over write it with 
desired value.

I think there should be a way to take an address from a received mail 
message and add it to a list you have in your address book.  This would 
be particularly handy if you had a whole bunch of people from different 
hosts as it is a pain to type all those names in.  By the way, I am 
running pine 3.89.  Is this fixed in later versions?

Right now, you can add a single address to your addres book but not add 
an address to a list.

If you use an explicit port specification, Pine will not try rsh access. 
IMAP is normally on port 143.  If your server is called imap.foo.edu, try:
 {imap.foo.edu:143}inbox
              ^^^^ the :143 is the ``use port 143'' specifier

The file imap/README documents how to set up an IMAP server, as does the 
Pine technical notes.

Do not use the imapd.conf capability.  This is evil, wicked, black magic, 
and sorcerer's apprentices who play with it will end up fighting a horde 
of water-bucket carrying brooms flooding the castle.  ;-)

In all seriousness, these files are used for special experimental purposes
at UW to override the normal behavior of imapd.  There are several highly
undocumented and bizarre side effects that occur when you change these
settings from their standard positions.  The form, and function, of any of
these is subject to change from version to version without notice.  It is
likely that if you depend upon anything done by this files you will be
very unhappy when you install the next version. 

imapd automatically configures itself for proper operation without any
configuration file.  If you use imapd.conf without having an intimate
understanding of what is going on in the source code, you're almost
certainly going to break both imapd and Pine on that system.  I've been
bit a few times myself (testing a particular experiment and forgetting to
delete it afterwards), and I wrote it! ;-)

Pine stores folders as text files, so you can just download the whole file. 
Look in your mail (or Mail) directory...

This is explained in Pine's m)ain ?)help text. The recipient at the other
site uses an older mail reader that doesn't conform to the MIME standard.
Tell them to use one of the products listed in the FAQ of comp.mail.mime.

This is likely to be a Frequently Asked Question.  So, without further 
ado...:

		 Content-Length Considered Harmful
				or
	  Fear and Loathing in the Unix Mail File Header

		Mark Crispin, UW-NDC 2 November 1995

INTRODUCTION:

The UNIX mbox format was delimited by lines of the form
	From <address> <date-time>
for example:
	From blurdybloop@foo.com Wed Nov  2 20:01:52 1994

Any line in the message text in that format has to be escaped in some way,
usually by prefixing it with a ">" character:
	>From blurdybloop@foo.com Wed Nov  2 20:01:52 1994

Some software quotes all lines that began with "From ":
	>From the data above, you can see the blurdybloop of the garply...
although this is not necessary since such lines are obviously not the 
start of a new message.

There are variations.  Not all systems include the seconds:
	From blurdybloop@foo.com Wed Nov  2 20:01 1994
Some systems have a symbolic timezone (e.g. "PST") before the year:
	From blurdybloop@foo.com Wed Nov  2 20:01 PST 1994
Other systems have a numeric timezone after the year:
	From blurdybloop@foo.com Wed Nov  2 20:01:52 1994 -0800
Some systems have an additional field that says "remote from <UUCP-node>":
	From blurdybloop@foo.com Wed Nov  2 20:01:52 1994 -0800 remote from foo
Pine supports 20 possible variations in all.

And all was more or less joy and light.  Or at least begrudged acceptance 
and enough to see your hand in front of your face.


LET'S FIX WHAT AIN'T BROKE:

to mean Stanford University Network] decided to "improve" the format of
UNIX mail files. 

These individuals felt that it was "inefficient" to look for lines that 
begin with "From ".  They invented a Content-Length: header line, which 
contained a byte count of the number of text bytes after the header.  
This meant, in theory, after reaching the blank line that separates the 
message text from the message body, you could do an fseek() to move that 
many bytes forward.


WHY IT'S BROKE:

There were problems with this notion.

1) Stdio does not guarantee that the numbers used by fseek() are really
   bytes from the start of the file.  So the "efficient" algorithm was
   by definition non-portable.

2) This header line was written by the originator of the message.  If the
   message was modified in transit (e.g. through a gateway that converts
   spaces to tabs, deletes trailing spaces, etc.), the size count would
   be messed up.

3) Mischievious users could messages with bogus Content-Length values to
   confuse your mail reader.

4) There are differences between UNIX newline (a single byte \012) and
   Internet newline (a two byte \015\012), with resultant impact on message
   text lengths.

5) One of the benefits of the UNIX mailbox format was that you could run a
   text editor on the file without damaging its subsequent usability with
   your mail reader.  Size-count based mailbox formats break this ability.

6) One of the benefits of a size-count mailbox format is to be able to find
   the next message quickly, even if you can not edit it with an editor.
   But because the Content-Length: header line could only be used as an 
   estimate, you end up not only having to scan the header for this header
   line but then hunting around in the mailbox at about the appropriate
   point for the next message.  This requires a lot of clever code and
   ends up not saving much at all.

7) It is possible to do fast block searches that are much faster than
   character-at-a-time searches.  Pine does a very basic form of fast
   search (that is nonetheless faster than the character-at-a-time
   search).  But you can't use such searches effectively if you have to 
   stop and do header parsing, or have to backtrack.

8) It forces the mail reader to parse the message header just to find
   the next message.  So, mail readers that try to save time by deferring
   message header parsing lose the startup time advantage.

9) Even when things work right, we weren't talking big savings here:
   less than 1/1000 of a second of CPU time per typical message, somewhat 
   more for the Multi-Megabyte MIMEgram From Hell.  But, you have to
   subtract the cost of doing a message header parse for every message (to
   find the Content-Length) which previously was unnecessary.

Bottom line: Content-Length combines the disadvantages of the UNIX mailbox
format (slow to find the next message) and a size-count format (can't edit
reliably) while retaining the advantages of neither.  It can have some 
performance benefits, but also entails performance costs.  Software which 
tries to support it takes a performance hit on *all* systems, even those 
which don't use it.  Finally, it has reliability and robustness costs.


WHERE WE STAND IN THE RESULTING FETID BOG:

There are individuals who are fans of Content-Length format, and loudly
evangelize its cause.  People with more experience shudder at the thought.
We on the Pine team fall into the latter category; if we tried to support
Content-Length, we'd slow down mail file reading for *all* users, and it
would make Pine less reliable and more vulnerable to the antics of
mischievious individuals.  So, we decline to do so. 

Although the above-named Silicon Valley workstation vendor is chiefly
responsible for distributing software that inflicts Content-Length upon
the email world, many internal users at that vendor avoid it like the
plague.  They replace the offending software with traditional format
software ("do what we say, not what we do").  Many of this vendor's
customers do likewise ("we'll do what you do, not what you say").

We recommend this course of action as well. 


WHAT YOU CAN DO TO ESCAPE THE SWAMP:

If sendmail is your mailer, the sendmail.cf file usually has an entry that
identifies the program that actually writes mail files.  Typically, it is
/bin/mail.  You can get a copy of our tools sendit or tmail (sendit is
more traditional, tmail is mostly for wizards only) from our FTP server
(ftp.cac.washington.edu), install it, and have sendmail point to that tool
instead. 

Sendit is smart enough to recognize that it only needs to insert the nasty
">" prefix in front of lines that are 100% in start-of-message header
format, and otherwise ignores lines that start with "From ".  This cures
99% of user complaints, and helps preserve a fast and reliable Pine.

This will *usually* work, but there are some cases where omitting the 
special name "inbox" after the host specification will cause problems,
so it is safer to say:

  inbox-path={werple.apana.org.au}inbox

I had the same problem. It stems from including stdio.h
fix
edit /usr/include/stdlib.h
BEFORE the line
     extern int system(con char *);
type 
     #if !defined(_STDIO_H)
then after the extern int system.... line
type
     #endif
Repeat for unistd.h except find the line rename

Novell, 

Is this a bug in the header?

I also find the pine -f folder option irritating since I
would like pine to read archival mail and news which is stored on a 
scratch disk. 

For this purpose I cd to the relevant directory and use elm -f 
folder.


Standard mail and elm  follows the rules

     -f [filename] Read messages from filename instead of  system
                   mailbox.   If  no  filename  is specified, the
                   mbox is used.

     -f +folder    Use the file folder in  the  folder  directory
                   (same  as  the  folder  command).  The name of
                   this directory is listed in the  folder  vari-
                   able.

Since pine may not want to revert to this, maybe 

pine -f -folder could default to reading the file folder in
the current directory. This seems logical.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split a digested article by typing G%
  while viewing it.  This will present each digest item on a submenu.  You
  can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key and
  g key pressed simultaneously) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                             In order to...
-------                             --------------
|                                   Pipe
a                                   Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/Folders/faq.split  Split the digest into individual
                                    messages and put them in a file named
                                    ~/Folders/faq.split.  (Replace ~/Folders
                                    with your folder directory.)
pine -if ~/Folders/faq.split        Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

Subject: 1.0 Automatic Signature - Basic Unix Instructions

Q: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my news articles
   and mail messages?

A: The answer depends on your newsreader and mailer but the following
   procedure works for many Unix newsreaders and mailers.


Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Change to your home directory (i.e., $HOME or ~)

pico .signature         Use the pico editor to create a .signature file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your signature>        Note that most systems require your sig to be <= 4
                        lines.  And it's good netiquette to make it as
                        short as possible.

<save and exit>         In Pico use ^x to exit and answer y when asked
                        if you want to save your changes.

chmod 644 .signature    Make .signature readable by all.

ls -l .signature        Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                        drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.

For many newsreaders and mailers this is all you need to do to set up your
signature.  For example the default behaviour of tin(1) and the rn family of 
tools - rn(1), trn(1), strn(1), & Pnews(1) - is to automatically append 
 ~/.signature, if it exists.  If you use Pine, Elm, Mail, Emacs Mail Mode, MH, 
NN, or GNUS follow the additional instructions described below.

After you've set everything up use your mailer to mail a test message
to yourself, and your newsreader and/or news poster (such as nnpost or Pnews)
to post an article to a test newsgroup (use a local newsgroup and Distribution
set to ``local'' to save bandwidth).  Note that with many newsreaders and 
mailers you will not see your signature while you are composing a message - 
it will be automaticlally appended when you send the message.  Note also that 
many systems add a line that contains ``-- '' to the top of your sig.  This is 
used by programs that automatically deal with mail or news to identify the 
start of the signature.

If you have a problem with your sig see section 1.9 on Troubleshooting.

Subject: ... 1.1 Pine 3.90 and Above
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

The default for Pine 3.90 and above is to automatically append .signature (if 
it exists) to your messages.  Many people like to set the signature-at-bottom 
variable which will put your signature below both your message and the message 
you are replying to (if you've included it).  Note that if you are forwarding 
a message your signature will be put below the message that you write but 
above the forwarded message.

To change Pine's signature features:

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the signature-at-bottom feature:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the signature-at-bottom variable
   b) Type x to set/unset this variable.
4. To change the name of your signature file:
   a) Arrow down to the signature-file line
   b) Type c for Change Value
   c) Type the path and name of the file you want to use for your
      signature.  Note that ~ can be used for your $HOME directory.

Subject: ... 1.2 Pine 3.89 and Below
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of
Pine 3.89 often want to edit their ~/.pinerc file so that it contains
the following:

feature-list=signature-at-bottom

If you want more than one feature in your feature-list then they need to
be comma separated like this:

feature-list=old-growth,
	signature-at-bottom

Note that Pine's default is to use ~/.signature for your signature so you
only need to edit the following line if you are using a different file.

signature-file=

Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of Elm
should edit their ~/.elm/elmrc file so that it contains the following:

signature = ~/.signature
sigdashes = ON

Remember to delete any # characters before any variables you want
to set.  The defaults are indicated in comment lines starting with ###.

Note that if you want to have a different signature for local mail
(i.e., addresses that don't contain a ! or @) then you can use the
localsignature and remotesignature variables instead of the signature
variable (which specifies one sig for all mail).

Subject: ... 1.4 Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.misc

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Regular Unix "Mail" and "mail" don't have an automatic
signature mechanism.  Many people who normally use a more deluxe
mail utility occasionally find themselves resorting to using one
of these, in which case all you need to know is this command:

	~r $HOME/.signature

This simply tells Mail to include the text of the your signature
file.

=o= If you use Mail on a regular basis you may want to use the
semi-automatic signature feature.  When you're done typing your
message, you append a signature with this command:

	~a

=o= In order for this to work, though, you need to set the
"sign" mail variable.  There are two ways to implement this
variable.  The first is to set it in a $HOME/.mailrc file with
a command like this:

	set sign="Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

If your signature is more than one line long, you can use the
C language string syntax, as in these examples:

	set sign="Jym Dyer\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

			-or-

	set sign="Jym Dyer\
	\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

=o= The disadvantage of doing this in your .mailrc file is
that you now have to maintain the text of your signature in
two places.  Another approach that avoids this problem is to set
"sign" as an environment variable in your shell startup script.
For a Bourne-compatible shell, this is done with this command:

	sign="`cat $HOME/.signature`" export sign

For a C-shell, do this:

	setenv sign "`cat $HOME/.signature`"

Subject: ... 1.5 Emacs Mail Mode

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Emacs Mail Mode is usually invoked with the "mail" or
"mail-other-window" commands (bound, respectively, to the
"C-x m" and "C-x 4 m" keys by default).  It is also invoked
from various Emacs mail and news packages.

=o= Mail Mode provides a "mail-signature" command to append
the contents of your signature file to the end of your mail
message.  This command is bound to "C-c C-w" by default,
so to insert the signature before mailing, simply type
"C-c "C-w".

=o= If you'd prefer to have your signature automatically
appended to the end of your mail message, the "mail-signature"
command can be put into your "mail-setup-hook" variable in
your $HOME/.emacs file, as in this example:

    (setq mail-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
	 (mail-signature) )))

This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.

Subject: ... 1.6 MH and Emacs MH-E
Followup-To: comp.mail.mh

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= MH doesn't have an automatic signature mechanism, but it
is so configurable that there are a number of different ways
to implement one.  Check the periodic "MH Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) with Answers" posting for details.

=o= CAVEAT:  If you use the environment variable SIGNATURE to
point to your signature file, MH will use it not as a signature,
but as your "fullname".  Even worse, if your version of MH was
built with the "UCI" option and you *don't* use the environment
variable SIGNATURE to point to another file, MH will use the
$HOME/.signature file for this purpose!  To see if your version
of MH has this behavior, enter this command:

  % send -help

And look for the string "[UCI]" in the output.

=o= There's an Emacs interface to MH, called MH-E.  It has its
own signature mechanism, which is invoked with the "mh-insert-
signature" command (bound to the "C-c C-s" keys by default).

=o= This will insert the file $HOME/.signature file by default.
If your signature file has another name (e.g., to avoid its
being used by an MH build with the "UCI" option), you can set
the "mh-signature-file-name" variable to refer to a different
file.

Followup-To: news.software.nn

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of NN
should edit their ~/.nn/init file so that it contains the following:

set query-signature off
set append-signature-mail on
set append-signature-post offf

Note that the reason that you need to ``set append-signature-post off'' is
that the news posting software (usually inews) automatically appends
 ~/.signature if it exists.  If you ``set append-signature-post on'' then
both nn and inews append your sig and you'll send out two identical sigs
every time.

Copyright (c) 1994 Mike Northam

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of GNUS
should verify that the value of the variable gnus-signature-file points to the
right place.  If you're in emacs, you can do so by evaluating the following
expression:
gnus-signature-file
                   ^ put your cursor here and type C-x C-e

you should see "~/.signature" in the echo area.  If not, edit your
$HOME/.emacs file and add the following:
(setq gnus-signature-file "~/.signature"))
Then load your $HOME/.emacs file or merely restart emacs and the variable
should be set correctly.

Subject: ... 1.9 Troubleshooting Signature Problems

A common problem people have with .signature (and .plan, .project, and
 .forward ) files is that the permissions are not set correctly.  Check
to make sure that you have set the permissions as instructed in 1.0 above.

If you are still having problems read the man pages for your newsreader,
news poster, or mailer and search for the string "signature".  There may be a
variable you need to set in order for the ~/.signature to be appended.

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
man CommandName |less   Open man pages for CommandName (elm, pine, nn, tin
                        trn, Pnews, etc.) and pipe through less.  If your
                        system doesn't have less replace it with "more".

/signature              Search for first occurrence of "signature".

n                       Search for next occurrence of "signature".
                        Repeat the search until you find the appropriate
                        section of the manual.

u                       Page up half a screen. (This works in less but not in
                        more.)

[spacebar]              Page down a screen. (This works in both less and more.)

Subject: 2.0 Finger - Basic Unix Instructions

People around the world can find out more about you by fingering you.  
This is done by typing the following at a Unix prompt:

   finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

On some systems finger is linked to f so the following also works:

   f YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name


Finger displays different information on different systems.  Often it will 
display your full name, your default shell, when your were last logged on, 
and your ~/.plan and ~/.project files.

If you finger someone and the display takes more than one page you can pipe 
the output through less (or more if you don't have less).  For example to 
find out about Halcyon, my Internet service provider, type:

  finger info@halcyon.com |less

If chfn is not available try "passwd -f".  If neither of these are
available then you will need to contact your system administrator and
ask him/her to change your full name, etc.

After you have changed your information check that they are in place
by fingering yourself.  Also to see a different display of your

chmod 644 .plan         Make .plan readable by all.

ls -l .plan             Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x.
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each.

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.


If you want a .project file follow the same procedure.  Note that only the
first line of the .project is displayed (so you might as well only make
it one line!).

To test your changes finger yourself by type each of the following at your
Unix prompt:

    finger YourUserID
    finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

To ensure that people from other systems can finger you should ask someone 
who's not on your system to finger you too.

This is complicated - and sometimes impossible - to setup.  For details see

One easy thing that you can do to see if anyone has fingered you is type the 
following at your Unix prompt:

  ls -lu $HOME/.plan

This tells you the last time someone accessed your .plan, but it doesn't
tell you who it was.  I have this in my .login because it's interesting to
see when the last time someone was checking on me!

[Note that under AFS (Andrew File System, a distributed filesystem),
 ls -lu $HOME/.plan will not work due to the fact that AFS has no 
 notion of ``atime'', or ``last accessed time''.]

Subject: ... 2.5 Backfinger Script

Copyright (c) 1994 Janet Rosenbaum

There is a script available called, among other things, backfinger,
planner, and finger_logger (flogger or frogger, for short).  This script
makes your plan into a named pipe (just think of this as a sort of
pipe used with plumbing that opens out onto the screen of the person who
is fingering you (fred)) so that when it is accessed, it looks for a
program from which to get something to stick on fred's screen.

The script is called when you are fingered.  At that moment, it looks to
the finger port of your unix machine and sees which machine fred is
on, logs that machine's IP number and hostname, and the date.  The script
can then execute a command to spit a plan out on fred's screen.  (One
might get creative and write a program that generates random poetry or
use the fortune program or just do "cat plan_file".)   To make fred
think you are really cool, it also tells him what machine he is
fingering you from.

Some caveats:

	-- This program must be running at all times on your system even
	when you are logged out.  Leaving a background process like this
	annoys most sys admins to no end, especially on systems with
	high load.  Do **not** run the program unless you are sure that
	you are allowed to run background processes like this.

	-- Also, if you decide you want to stop running this program,
	remove your .plan file as soon as you kill the process.  If you
	do not do this, all finger processes for you will hang.

	-- This script only tells you the machine fred is fingering you
	from, not his actual username.  It is nearly impossible to get
	this information except at sites with bad security.


Given the above, I will distribute the script to those who can use it,
mostly for educational reasons.  I admit that I no longer run the
program, since my two main accounts are on rather high-load systems.
Nevertheless, I learned quite a lot from modifying these scripts and
otherwise playing with these ideas.

Here is the web site:

 http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~jrosen/scripts/logger.src

I will also try to post this answer and the program to comp.sources.misc
at least monthly for those without web access.  (For those who have not
figured out the web, try the program lynx if you are on a vt100 or vt220
type terminal.  If you are on an xterm or hpterm, look for xmosaic.)

Note:  I am not the author of this program.  The version I distribute is
virtually identical to that distributed by Steve Franklin.

It is considered good netiquette to keep your signature to four lines or
less.  And many news posters, like inews, will not post an article
that has a signature with more than four lines in it.  So, put large
pictures, your life story, etc. in your finger files or in your Web pages
and point people to them in your signature.

A good source of art for your signature and finger files is the ascii art
FAQ which contains (among others) these topics:
   9  Where can I find ASCII art?
  22  How do I put an animation in my plan?
  23  How do I make a sig?
  24  How do I have my sig automatically added to my posts and email?

The Ascii Art FAQ can be found at either of the following.  (I think
these aren't the same so you might want to look at both of them.)
http://gagme.wwa.com/~boba/faq.html
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/ascii-art-faq/faq.html

One particularly good place to find ascii art is:

Subject: 4.0 Organization Header

The Organization header in news and mail messages is another way you can tell 
people about yourself.  It is an optional header described in section
2.2.8 of RFC1036, "Standard for Interchange of Usenet Messages."

Subject: ... 4.1 Tin and the RN Family
Followup-To: news.newusers.questions

Tin and the rn family of tools (Pnews, rn, trn, strn) get information for the 
Organization header from the ORGANIZATION environment variable if it exists.  
In the csh or tcsh you can set this variable in your ~/.login with a line like 
this:

  setenv ORGANIZATION "Your Organization Name"

After you edit your ~/.login you can establish the setting by either logging
out and loggin back in or by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

  source ~/.login

To check that the variable is set type:

  printenv

After it is set, post a test message to a local test newsgroup with local
distribution to check that the Organization header is correct.

Subject: ... 4.2 Pine 3.90 and Above
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In Pine 3.90 or above you set the Organization and other headers using the
customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the customized-hdrs variable.
   b) Type a for Add Value
   c) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
      Note that if you have set the ORGANIZATION environment variable
      (which is described in 4.1 above) you can type: 
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION

While reading a message that you've received you can view the Organization
header and all the other headers by typing h.  If h does not work you need 
to go to your configuration menu and set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

Note that the customized-hdrs variable is not available in Pine 3.89 and
below.

Use your editor to put the following lines in your ~/.nn/init file:

set news-header Organization: Your Organization Name
set mail-header Organization: Your Organization Name

This will add the Organization header to both news and mail messages
sent from NN.

While reading messages with NN you can view the Organization line
by adding O (the letter "oh") to your header-lines variable setting.
I like the following setting:

set header-lines AFOnWK*Y

This is so basic that I hesitate to ask it on a listserv, but how does 
one get the update installed and running on a pc?  We have a Pine update 
menu for 3.91 with instructions, and a PKUNZIP.exe. What file does one 
select for a Solaris2.3, and what does one do with it and the PKUNZIP 
*after* they've been saved to a pine folder? Help!

Yes, we've seen similar behaviour (a looping Pine) here on our SGI platforms.

Interestingly, some sessions go into tight CPU burning loops, whilst 
others just sit clocking up about a seconf od CPU every eleapsed minute 
or so.  I haven't managed to isolate what people did to get into that state.

I have also had similar problems with imapd's, which may point the finger 
elsewhere as well/instead of the source you suggest.

Date: 3 Nov 1994 21:31:27 GMT
Message-Id: <39bkrg$ms2@lastactionhero.rs.itd.umich.edu>

I have had some problems as of late with pine 3.91 and it recognising my
.addressbook

We upgraded recently from pine v3.07 and everything worked fine.  except
now for some reason, i can't get into my .addressbook

I can get into it using pine 3.07 just by typing "a" from the main menu.
when i type "a" from pine 3.91 i don't get my addressbook...it just says
"empty"

The configurations that i have are:
address-book           = ~/.addressbook           
[X]  expanded-view-of-addressbooks         
                             
and that's it. my .addressbook is indeed at /home/markstep/.addressbook
and that does show up when the "empty" addressbook shows up::   
           [Now in addressbook /home/markstep/.addressbook] 

any suggestions?

desparately yours,
mark

If the servers at A and B have IMAP services enabled, you can configure Pine
to access the remote folder as a secondary INBOX (i.e.  incoming-folder). 
Then you don't have to worry about the duplication of forwarding...

No, its not a bug in the header and your fix is incorrect.  The problem is
not that stdio.h and stdlib.h both have a (compatible) declaration for
system(), but that if ANSI is not defined, one of Pine's headers has
an incompatible declaration of system().  See the other postings on
this today, or a posting I made in response to someone else about pine
a week or two ago.

If you set enable-aggragate-command-set, in Setup Config, you get some 
more commands. ;-select, A-apply and one more.  You can then ;-select 
all the messages you want to save to a file and A-apply E-export all the 
selected messages to a file.

You lose all the headers this way, which can be good for a mailing list 
you just want to read.  If you need the headers, just download the folder 
file.

I remember (at least I think I do) back when pine seemed to "know" 
whether it was being used over a modem or not and adjusted its "slow-link"
setting accordingly. Never versions don't seem to do so anymore. I (and
other less computer literate people in my group) call in on a modem as
often as we check our mail on the terminal. Is there a way to get the
newer versions of pine to check to se if we are logged on via a modem? I'm
sure it can be done via a series of environent variables, csh resource
files, etc., but I'd rather set up just one command for both environments.

I am having the same problem using Windows Terminal, dialing in.  I have 
tried the "Preserve-stop-start" option to no avail.  After closing the 
session, then Windows dumps pages of garbage to the printer.  Only 
happens with 3.91.  Hmmmm.

When attached to a LAN, it's not an issue.

Platform: Sparc, SunOs 4.1.3, Pine 3.90

I assumed that Pine used the Unix mail "From" format for its
folders. 

However, it fails to open mail folders created with the Emacs MUA VM
5.72, so my assumption would seem to have been wrong.

So, what format does it use?

What i fail to understand here, is how should Pine know what filename to give
for the mail you are exporting. Let's say I do set a filename for two messages
to be exported one after another. So assuming this feature works, the second
time i export, it should do it automatically without prompting for a filename.
If this happens then how does the export work meaning....whether the file gets
overwritten or appended to?

===========================================================================
        FEATURE: select-without-confirm

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Save, Export, and Goto commands.
These commands all take text input to specify the name of the folder or
file to be used, but allow you to press ^T for a list of possible names.
If set, the selected name will be used immediately, without further
opportunity to confirm or edit the name.

SORRY if this has been solved and posted and re-posted about, but i havn't
reading the net for a while, and don't know about it...
anyways...

When we print out a message to "1" "attached-to-ansi", it will cause our
local printer to start flashing (print coming) and then stop...no print-out
I was wondering if any of you gurus had any brilliant ideas about this,
or if anybody got this problem!

When I print from a Telnet window in MS-Windows, using the "Y" command, 
The output consists of one line with no carrige returns, using most 
printers. Using the "text" printer in MS-Windows the print starts OK, but 
only prints 80 or so characters, with carriage returns handled correctly. 
I am using Chameleon 3.11N as my PPP connection and my Telnet app. Anyone 
solved this problem?

In 3.90, we had a lot of runaway processes on SunOS 5.3 but none on our
HP-UX 9000/{710,730,750} boxes (that I recall).

Since 3.91, most of our problems have been with left-over dormant
processes that don't eat up time.  All of these have appeared with HP-UX
9.01 (but not with SunOS 5.3).  We currently have about 12 HP-UX
workstations with such processes.  If another user tries to run a Pine
session, then on 10 of the 12 this is OK whereas on the other 2 it led to
an error message like: 
   Pid Killed Text I/O modification
or some words like that.  I have just killed processes on the two whereas I 
have done nothing with the 10 yet (as they are relatively harmless!).

Subject: PC-Pine slow over Ethernet
Date: 4 Nov 1994 17:21:53 GMT
Message-Id: <39dqjh$be4@sundog.tiac.net>

I have some users running PC-Pine with their mail stored on a Linux host 
running imapd.  Access to their inboxes is incredibly slow, often up to 
a minute or more, despite being connected over ethernet.  Occasionally 
also get repeated ICMP errors which are eventually followed by the 
prompt to log into the mailbox.  Why is this so slow and what can I do
about it?

Unix users who telnet into the Linux host have no such problems (but 
then their mail is on the same box).

I had already known about the new bug in Pine that broke the local sending
of bugs mail and had fixed that by updating the os-xxx file, but of course
that wasn't the real problem. (Figured U Wash. really would not like to
get questions from our thousands of users.)

Since I always use my own printer, I hadn't noticed that the
standard-printer defined in our local /usr/local/lib/pine.conf wasn't
working either.  That was more critical to us since tons of users print
to our central printer which we want by default defined as 2-up printing
and it's own queue.

The real fix was to a few of those pesky lines of code added to init.c
between Pine 3.90 and Pine 3.91.  It jumps out of the loop for "user
controlled variables" even when it's processing pine.conf or
pine.conf.fixed . The fix was simply to move the continue statement inside
the if . 

Here's the diff (at line 2097, etc in the code):
--------------
tk>diff init.c init.c.original
2097d2096
<                 continue;
2098a2098
>             continue;
tk>

--------------

Hope this helps anyone with the same problem.

I have the XON rec'd see preservr-etc message too, but it doesn't mess up 
the screen, but is bothersome.  What does cause this.  I looked at 
preserve-start-stop, but didn't see anything relevant.

Hi there;
         I know this has been discussed before, but I cannot find it.  Is 
there a way to filter msgs from certain people so they don't reach the 
inbox? - I am using Pine 3.90 (Adm will not update).

Any ideas suggestions will be greatly eppreciated.

Thank You,
          Jorge.

I currenlty PPP to my SMTP server and use popcli to access my mail. I would
like to start using pine, but my account has a password.  Is is possible to
specify a password in .pinerc?

I've tried to write a script to get my mail using popcli and place it in my
inbox but pine gives me a corrupted folder message.  The format of the mail
header info is very similar to that of pine mail with slight diffs

eg. lacking the following -->
Content-Type: text
Content-Length: 48
Status: RO
X-Status:

Could I add this info to my mail or is there an easier way to solve this?

When my users login on the dialin lines at 2400 baud and then run pine3.91,
they get scrambled screen displays and see messages telling them XON
received, see preserve-start-stop setting in Setup/Config.

Any idea what is causing this or how to fix it?

Jim and Michael,
The "irrelevant" feature you mention is *intended* to fix exactly the 
problem you describe...  If it does not, please let us know.

The cause of recurring XON/XOFF messages is that either your communication
software or your modem or your site's modem or its terminal server is 
configured for "software flow control", by which Unix and Pine receive an 
XOFF when the PC/modem/whatever is about to have its communication buffer 
overrun, and an XON when it is safe to resume sending data.

That's fine, but you need to tell Pine about it via the
"preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, and be aware that when so
configured, if you ever inadvertently type control-S (XOFF), Pine will
then appear to freeze until you enter a control-Q (XON). 

This feature *currently* assumes that Unix has s/w flow control enabled 
before Pine starts... in 3.92 we'll remove that assumption, so that the 
feature will work regardless of the previous Unix tty settings.

I have seen a lot of conversations on prefiltering pine mail, but not
on postfiltering. I prefer to look at my mail most of the time, before I
run my filters. 

This brings up two senarios, that I do not seem to be able to do currently.

1) stuff my "read-messages" to the read-messages-folder ("incoming" in my 
case), without quitting pine.
Then I could call up a filter ("/usr/local/mh/lib/slocal -user rsw" in my 
case), and continue on reading my now nicely seperated mail.

2) be able to set read-message-folder=| /usr/local/mh/lib/slocal -user $USER
so it could all happen automagicaly.. 
I tried "h;aa|/usr/local/mh/lib/slocal -user rsw" but the "from " line is 
not there and it all looks like one mail message to slocal. 

Currently, I have to get into pine, connect to the imap server, 
scan/read/delete/expunge my first pass though my mail (hundreds of messages),
quit pine (saves my read messages) run my filter, get back in pine, and 
start reading though my 20 odd folders.

I do not think this would be too hard to implement, but would be very 
convienient.

I do really like pine. 

Thanks, for and tips, ideas, thoughts.

Randall

We are considering using a dummy username's inbox as our incoming fault 
report conduit. The idea is that lots of people could have a window open 
running		pine -if /var/spool/mail/dummy_username

These lots of people have  group read permission on the spool file.

It works up to a point, but new arrivals are not reflected in the 
read-only sessions. If a session is read-only, why shouldn't pine 
periodically check the mail spool for changes? The person with the r/o 
session isn't changing anything ...

	Can some kind soul help me with how to sort messages into separat

I posted a message just a week or so ago, about compiling pine 3.90.
Thanks to the answers I received, I had it built -- just about the
time that 3.91 was released!

I have already been in contact with people from UofW; based on the
various fixes I have received, I hope to be submitting to the pine
development group, the info necessary for a clean a UnixWare-specific
build option. I just hope there aren't any significant changes in the
config files between 3.90 and 3.91.

It's not at the top of my list of things-to-do, and it's probably a
while 'till their next release. But it *will* come.

Pine currently supports variations of at least six different local folder
formats, with a few others available as options.  Send a sample folder that
Pine fails to open to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu as an attachment and we
will take a look at it...

There's a sendmail flag that will turn 'From ' into '>From ' inside a
message body during local delivery; otherwise that 'From ' will look
like it's the start of a new message.  Mailx uses another method to
tell messages apart, which is why it didn't get confused.  Ask your
system administrator to check the flags used on sendmail's local
delivery agent.  I thought that /bin/mail, the default local delivery
agent, doesn't need that flag, but perhaps your administrator is using
some other program for local delivery.

Umm...make that 'mail' (lowercase m), as Mail dir. is created by Elm.
Atleast that's how it is here, so as DLM said it is either Mail or mail dir.
depends on how the setup is at your site.

David, at first this explanation was perfectly clear.  Later, though, I
wondered how one could type ^G after the "E" command.  Isn't "E" one of the
commands that is supposed to work with ^T?  The help screen seems to
indicate this is so.

I do know that PINE asks at the end of every month if I want to move 
sent-mail to f.ex. sent-mail-october.
Even thow I said yes, now everytime I start PINE it asks me if I want to 
delete sent-mail-oct? And this happens even for users that got a new 
account since Nov 1st. I have a pine.conf.fixed file, do I have to change 
something there? 
Salut!

Hi,

I have been using MH for about two years and have collected a lot
of mail.  I've heard that pine is able to access mail in MH folder
format, but I can't find any documentation on setting it up for
this purpose.  So, does anybody know the trick?

I'm using Pine 3.89 and MH 6.8.3 on Solaris 2.2.

Thanks,

Hi, there:

Is anybody here know how to setup an alias for a 300 list of people?
The aim is to avoid the address to be all listed on the header, ie,
it is prefered to use a BCC type of aliases. Currently, it is causing
us trouble because the BCC doesn't allow so many people.

We will also appreciate ways to do this in elm or pine.

Thanks,

                      MIME  Status Report
                      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  
  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an important
  standard for conveying pictures, audio, formatted data, and ordinary
  text in email.  It describes many data types; many Unix, Windows, and
  Mac mail programs implement MIME to varying degrees.
  
  Dave Crocker, a noted internetworking consultant, will give a status
  report on MIME and its implementations.  He will address questions
  like: What's the real purpose of MIME and its data types?  If I want
  to develop an application that uses email, can I rely on my customers
  having MIME?  When will the email I receive be enriched via MIME?  How
  can I send MIME-enriched mail to others?

	Uh, yes, you need a nickname for each entry. What would be the

Just put the following two lines into your .forward at your A account:

\A
B

So a copy will be kept at your A account.  The backslash is needed to
prevent infinite loops.

Each mail folder in pine is simply an ordinary text file in your "Mail" 
subdirectory, containing all the saved messages one after the other. So,
at your UNIX prompt, "cd Mail", then "ls" to see what you have there.  You
should see a file named something like "sent-mail-oct-1994".  Download it 
to your PC like any other text file, then delete it with "rm."

Subject: Disabling MIME-encoding
Date: 4 Nov 1994 09:32:01 GMT
Message-Id: <39cv2h$f93@ugle.unit.no>

Is there some way to disable the MIME-encoding og 8-bit messages? 
In Norway the ISO-8859-1 character set is becoming a standard, but
Pine insists on using MIME encoding, placing =E5 and suchlike for the
above-128 character codes. 

Most people in Norway do not have mailclients that understand MIME, so
it looks awful. We would like to send 'clean' 8-bit ISO. The alternative
is to use 7bit (Norwegian ascii, replacing some brackets with our
"extra" alphabet characters), but we'd rather prefer 8-bit, to help
push people away from 7bit to 8bit. For communication with English-
speaking countries there will be no difference, as the English 
alphabet never uses the eigth bit.

Any hints? Please send me mail (see below), and I'll post a summary if
I get anything useful. Thanks.

On UNIX systems that's typically handled by the vacation(1) program.

I think you can get a similar result with some mail filtering
programs, like deliver or procmail.

Message-Id: <DAVIDY.94Nov3172924@vw.hwcae.az.Honeywell.COM>


I just compiled pine (3.89) for my HP/UX 700.
I also ported IMAPd to an Apollo DomainOS system (that's where the mail is).

Pine seems to run fine (despite these messages) but I keep getting 

   [IMAP error: Command unrecognized: FETCH]
   [Command unrecognized: FETCH]

When I type 'D' to delete a message, or 'U' to undelete a message, I get:

   [IMAP error: Command unrecognized: -FLAGS]
   [Command unrecognized: -FLAGS]

I can read my mail and it would appear that I can do everything else
(reply ,forward, etc) without a problem, other than the fact you keep
getting those annoying messages about every 5 to 15 seconds.

Any idea as to what is wrong?

Is there a FAQ for PINE?

We are running Linux 1.1.59 and are not running imapd.  I'm not sure what

mkpgp is a c-shell script that provides PGP encryption to Pine.

For the last modification time:

	finger slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | grep mkpgp

For the readme and a uuencoded mkpgp:

	finger slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | pgp -f > mkpgp.txt

For the executable script:

	finger slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | pgp -f | uudecode

Enjoy.

Message-Id: <39afm4$q77@piaget.moe.ac.sg>

I've been using Pine3.91 on my Sun workstation running Solaris2.3.
I was trying PCPINE for windows and got the following error:

Cant connect to piaget.moe.ac.sg.143: Refused <10061>


I tried to telnet to piaget.moe.ac.sg 143 but to no avail.

Must I run something at port 143? and what is it?
How do I run it in Solaris2.3?

Is it possible for an unprivleged user to set up Unix Pine 3.91 to call

This sounds like a problem with your port of imapd to Applo DomainOS. 
FETCH is certainly a valid command in the IMAP protocol, although this
error message can also happen if there are no arguments after the FETCH
command due to an oddity in imapd's parser.

Another possibility may be your HP/UX port.  Did you modify Pine, and in
particular, the c-client/imap2.c or c-client/tcp_unix.c files, in any way? 
These error mesages can happen if spurious newlines were being inserted 
in the IMAP protocol stream.

I suggest that you review all modifications made to the sources.  Also, 
the current version of Pine is Pine 3.91.

The Pine FAQ is on pine/docs on the ftp.cac.washington.edu anonymous FTP 
server.

When I try to prYnt my .addressbook in Pine 3.91, it gets about half-way 
down the page, then skips about a page-worth of entries before 
continuing.  I checked .addressbook for something unusual at the point 
where it skips, but all's well.  If I drop back to Pine 3.89 and prYnt 
the same .addressbook, it comes out perfect.  I'm encountering no other 
printing anomalies associated with attached-to-ANSI printing.

Is this a known bug?

Yes, you must run impad on port 143.

When you built pine the imapd would also have been built in the impad
directory.

You should move this file to someplace like /usr/local/bin and then make
an entry such as:

imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/bin/imapd    imapd

in your inetd.conf file.  After you do that you need to find the PID
of inetd and send simply do a kill -1 on that PID.  Then you should be
able to telnet hostname 143 and get a greeting similar to:

Connected to hobbes.
Escape character is '^]'.
* OK hobbes IMAP2bis Service 7.8(92) at Mon, 7 Nov 1994 09:24:50 -0800 (GMT)

That's it....

Chip,
Do you have the feature "preserve-start-stop-characters" set?
If not, what happens when you do?

The "collective wisdom of the net", eh?

Did you try reading the Solaris FAQ?

6.10) Why doesn't readdir work?

    You're probably linking with libucb and didn't read the
    previous question.  (The readdir in libucb.so wants you to
    include sys/dir.h, many SunOS 4.1.x programs included
    <dirent.h>, consequently, you're mixing native <dirent.h>
    struct dirent with libucb readdir().
    The symptom of this mixup is that the first two characters
    of each filename are missing.  Make sure you use the native
    compiler (default /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc, which may not be in
    your PATH), and not /usr/ucb/cc.


IMHO you should trust that use user has the correct path, and 'cc'
is indeed the right C compiler.  I bet that one of you if you were
to say "which cc" returns "/usr/ucb/cc".

If you try to build Pine with /usr/ucb/cc you WILL have trouble.

I'd just put a warning message if you type 'build sol' that warns
that you can't use /usr/ucb/cc.  In fact you could even hack the
build script to return an error if [ `which cc` = "/usr/ucb/cc" ].).

If the machine is UNIX-based, chance is that he uses a program called

You need to get a program called procmail.. the actual filename is
'procmail.tar.gz'.  I don't have an address for it off hand, try doing an
archie or webcraller search for it.

Yes, it is necessary.  The nicknames are used as keys when looking up the 
entries in the address book.

The spacing of the tabs isn't something you can control, either.  Pine 
tries to set the spacing so that as much as possible of the fields will 
show, so shortening long fields will cause the spacing to be reduced.

Hello.

First, you should use ``build sol'' instead of ``build sv4''.

You've been bit by the wonderful Solaris ``I dunno which library to link,
so I'll guess the wrong one'' bug.  This problem has been bedeviling us
for ages.  The Collective Wisdom Of The Net has been applied, and nothing 
has worked.  Or rather, worked for everyone.

We found ourselves with a situation in which the c-client/imapd programmer
(me) can correctly build imapd but not Pine, and the Pine programmer can
correctly build Pine but not c-client -- with no apparent differences in
our environments!! 

The basic problem is that Solaris has two environments, BSD and SVR4, each
with a slightly different directory entry structure that is offset from
each other by two bytes.  Pine on Solaris is SVR4, but for some reason the
!@#$%^&* Solaris linker decides to link it to be BSD. 

We've pulled hair on this for months.  What makes things worse is that the
outside Solaris world seems to be split just like we are: some can build
imapd correctly but not Pine; others can build Pine correctly but not
imapd.  Then there are other lucky people who can build both.

The cc5 hack (courtesy of the Collected Wisdom Of The Net) used to build
Pine works fine for the Pine programmer, but not for me.  cc works fine 
for me when building imapd, but not when building a short C program that 
demonstrates the problem.

As far as we know, SUN denies that there is anything at all wrong.  It's
probably some wierd environment variable that needs to be set, but we're
stumped.  It is an abomination that SUN dares to ship a system in which a
program can be compiled SVR4, but lunk BSD, without generating any
``incompatible library'' error messages.  I'm embarassed enough about this
problem (it's my code that's getting confused), but SUN should be ashamed
that their development tools permit it to happen.

The binaries on our FTP server are built correctly.  Unless you need to
have locally-built binaries, you may want to use our pre-built Solaris
binaries instead.  We're aware of the problem, and careful to test our
Solaris binaries to make sure they've been built correctly. 

Thank you for bearing with us.  Sooner or later, we'll find out what's 
wrong and fix it once and for all.

The problem is, how could I forward my incoming mails at A to B WITHOUT
deleting them at A? That is, I can still read at A?

The following was sent to me by one of our staff.  I am hoping someone 
out there has an answer to this.  We are just beginning to use VMS Pine 
(from Innosoft) at our site.  Since we are subscribed to your listserv, 
please direct your response to helpdesk@medusa.unm.edu.

I know the "<>" is another representation of "[]" for directory 
specifications; however, most of our users know only of the square 
brackets for this purpose.  Can we change this from "<>" to "[]"?

Finally, can a default path be used rather than the path that it 
originated from?

Thanks!

Subject: Pine email 

I know this isn't high priority for you but...
I think that Pine will be useful for sending files (particulary binary 
files) through email.  I know at least one person per class asks for this 
capibility.  And [name omitted] would be most impressed if he could have 
this.

I've been working with it trying to send a binary file (which works just 
fine).  However, when you tell Pine to save it, it fills in the path and 
username of the _sender_ of the file.  For example, I sent a file from 
MCCSDESK to CDEAN.  As CDEAN, I view the attachment, and tell PINE to 
save that section as a file.  It fills in the following as the default 
filename:
<USER.MCCSDESK>filename.ext
I can edit the <> as well as the username to correct it, but there must 
be a better way.
I have looked at the pine.pinerc in both my Unix and VMS account and 
cannot see where the <> is coming from, nor where to specify a default 
save directory.  
I did change the Folder-Collections and Mail-directory, to no 
avail.
Any ideas?

Message-Id: <39ls18$qtv@lyra.csx.cam.ac.uk>

I'm running Pine 3.89 under HP-UX 9.01 on various 700 series HPs.

The timezone (TZ) is set to GMT0BST.  The UK reverted to GMT on 23rd
October, and all other programs on our systems are correctly reporting
the time in GMT (including sendmail and other MUAs). However, Pine is
creating date stamps of the form:

Date: Mon, 7 Nov 1994 17:08:54 +0100 (BST)

where the actual time is in GMT (i.e. it was 17:08 local time when the
mail was sent), and hence the time is an hour out.

Is there some configuration I've missed to fix this?  I couldn't find
anything in the FAQ, or anything in the 3.91 release notes to suggest
3.91 fixes this.

please, send this to us (service@innosoft.com) since you know you got Pine
from Innosoft, not to the good pine people at UW who are not responsible
for Pine on VMS. They may not mind, but I feel quilty everytime I see one
of these which should be addressed to me.

not easily, because Pine assigned special meaning for [] before it ever 
ran on VMS. This may be possible, but it is certainly low on my list of 
things to do to Pine. Functionality is more important than cosmetics.

this is the default because when the sender sends the message with Pine, 
the file name becomes part of the description of this attachment, and it 
is a perfectly reasonable name to use as a default (what else could be 
reasonable?) filename. I would probably agree that the directory and disk 
names are not always useful, but that all is part of the filename, and I 
can think of many cases where the directory would be a reasonable default 
when saving the part also. So the user is given the choice to change it 
to whatever he wants.

as for the difference between <> and [], Pine, being started on UNIX, 
uses [] for special meaning as a description when you attach a file, the 
fact that VMS uses [] as directory delimiter only makes it parse 
incorrectly. So I chose the alternate VMS directory spec <>.

maybe an additional option would be nice. yup, and since this is not a 
VMS-specific request, it would be proper to address this to pine-info.

I recently sent a letter to a friend, and he has 
programmed his mail handler (I don't know if it is PINE) to automatically 
send out a message to people who e-mail him telling them he is not 
available. Anyone can tell me if this can be done with PINE 3.90?

Subject: pine 3.91 NFS locking on IRIX5.2
Message-Id: <Cyws5I.ECt@cunews.carleton.ca>
Date: Mon, 7 Nov 1994 17:48:53 GMT

I had recently posted in comp.sys.sgi.apps about how pine 3.87 locks up 
when opening/saving to mailboxes over NFS, under IRIX 5.2

I received the suggestion from more than 1 person to upgrade pine to 3.9, 
and build using the "EXTRADRIVERS=mbox" option.

I compiled pine3.91 yesterday, using the mbox option.

The problem is exactly the same as before. Whenever mail is saved to 
another box, or I open any box except my INBOX (/usr/mail/csaldanh), 
pine locks up, apparently when trying to NFS lock that mailbox. It locks 
up, so that it can't be killed with ^C or suspended with ^Z. It must be 
killed -9. It screws up NFS so bad that I sometimes can't log back into 
the machine. It trys forever to mount my home directory. The machine 
must be rebooted.

This does not happen under IRIX 4.0.5, on the same network/account. 
4.0.5 works just fine (presumably because it is SVR3).

I am having to read mail via IMAP mailboxes to get around this. It 
means that all the users must be validated each time they start pine, 
just to read their mail. I don't want to have to do that.

Any ideas? I would prefer to get pine running via NFS again.

A bug has been discovered in .newsrc updating in Pine 3.91.  If the user 
opens a newsgroup that is not currently in the .newsrc file (via the G 
command), deletes some messages, and then quits, Pine will write a line 
to the .newsrc that is not terminated with a newline.

The workaround for this problem is to subscribe to new newsgroups before 
opening them.  Subscribing writes a proper .newsrc line which is then 
updated properly.

This bug is fixed in Pine 3.92.

Thanks, Terry.  That did the trick.  I saw the help for that feature, but 
since I wasn't having the garbled output to the screen symptom, I didn't 
think that was my problem.  It might not be a bad idea to add a mention 
of the 'attached-to-ANSI' problem to that help entry.

Is there a downside to setting that feature on?  I figure it's not the 
default for some reason.

Chip,
The downside to setting the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature 
(and the reason it's not the default) is that if someone accidentally 
types a Ctl-S (XOFF), or line noise is interpreted as one, then Pine
will mysteriously freeze with no warning, unless/until a Control-Q
is received.

If you have the option of configuring your equipment and comm software for
h/w flow control, then you can have the best of both worlds... But if you 
have a device or software that requires software flow-control, there is no
alternative but to accept this risk.

Chris,
Why not use rsh preauthentication with your IMAP server?  Then you can 
avoid the locking hassles of NFS and also avoid a separate login.

Hello everyone,

I'm looking for a 'pine' program for my 
	SunOS  Release 4.0.3_Export Generic
The system is very cruelly set up so there is no
compiler nor gunzip utilities in place just yet.
so if you know where I can get (we have not installed
'ftp' yet either) please let me know. The best way
is to send me a compiled verion of pine to
	ale@frodo.mece.ualberta.ca
Also, if you know where I can get Pico (the editor)
then your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you
very much in advance.

Andy.

I have some NewBie questions. Answers, or pointers to answers would be 
greatly appreciated.
[Questions based on the fact that I used to use tin for Newsreader, but 
Pine 3.91 is so much more user-friendly and usable!]

1. Is there a flag to get  Pine to mark articles I have read as 'read' 
and not redisplay them when I go back into the group? (I know how to do 
it for mail and move it my 'read' folder, but have not found anything on 
News...)

2. Is there a way to sort incoming mail one way (say by arrival) and news 
folders another way (say ordered subject)?

3. Is there any way to get the number of unread articles in a newsgroup 
at the folder list?

Thanks in advance for any and all assitance.

I was wondering if there was a way to stop Pine V3.91 from expanding the 
To: field when you put a groupname in it.  For example, if you type 
"workgroup" in the To: field, you may get 30 names...what if you don't 
want to print out all 30 names?  Could you just put the "workgroup" in 
the Bcc field? I know that would be a little cumbersome, but i guess it 
would work...any suggestions?
email appreciated

At the moment the "read-message" folder feature only applies to INBOX,
and not to newsgroups.

Note that Pine, unlike some other newsreaders, doesn't cause messages to
disappear simply because they have been viewed once.  If you don't want to
see them again, you mark them Deleted, just as in mail.  Since the newsrc
file is used to record which messages you've marked as deleted, it can't
accurately record exactly which ones you've seen. However, you might find the
"news-approximates-new-status" feature useful.

Subject: How to add HEADERS ?
Date: 7 Nov 1994 23:02:24 -0800
Message-Id: <39n7q0$oj8@coyote.rain.org>

I have tried to add a header that says, (w/o quotes), 
"Reply-To:username@address" and I don't seem to be able to do it.  I 
tried by starting Pine and then choosing Config then Setup (or is it 
Setup then Config?)  Anyway...

I got a message to the effect, "Headers not found.  Using default header 
information." or something like that.

So then I tried editing the .pinerc file in my home dir and got the same 
message.

HELP!  Please tell me what I am doing wrong.

Thanks.

For some reason, the cursor keys don't work for Pine on my HP workstation.  Has
anyone else had this problem?  Is there a solution?

The timezone code has been completely rewritten since Pine 3.89.  In
particular I believe the HP port did have a bug like you describe...

Take a multiuser machine, say a Sun 4/370. If it can support N pc users 
who telnet in and run a continuous pine session, it can presumably 
support M x N pc users were they all to adopt an IMAP based PC mua. Any 
guesses on the value of M? (We get N up to 40 or so on the model suggested).

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

My question/problem has to do with From and Reply-To addresses.  I'm running PINE 
version 3.89 on a VMS host(the Bourvine port) talking to an IMAP server on a UNIX box.  
When I compose a message, the From address is created using the username on the VMS 
host.  I'm told that PINE on UNIX works the same way.  If I do not modify the "user-domain" 
variable in the pine.conf file, then the address is repliable.  That is, the username and 
hostname for the From address are taken from the VMS client.

What I would like is for either the From address or a Reply-to address(this does not get 
created now) to be the address(username and hostname) of the account on the IMAP server.  
One other thing to note is that the usernames on the VMS "client" are not the same as the 
associated account on the IMAP server box.  For example, John Smith user may have an 
account on the VMS system with a username "smith" while on the IMAP server, his 
username is "john".

If I could get the From address or the Reply-to address to use the username on the server, I 
could modify the "user-domain" flag on the client so that the hostname is not used in the 
>From address which would result an appropriate reply address to the 
server(username@domain) via an MX record.

Any help you could offer would be much appreciated.  I would even consider altering the code 
if that's what must be done and if you could point me in the right direction.

A quick question which probably has a simple solution that I don't see.

I just upgraded from 3.05 to 3.91 and now the Message-ID does not contain
the complete FQDN but just the hostname.  I have tried a few of the
options which I thought should have an effect but nothing seems to work. 
Is there a way to get the fully qualified name without doing a compile?

Thanks.

I have noticed that the answer flag does not show up when I reply to

any remedies, other than moving the mail first and then replying?

pine 3.91


Hello

Is there any way I can do compound string search ?

I have a folder of a 1000 messages. I search (;ta) for string:  lang 
1) I search (;ta) for string:  lang
2) Then I 'zoom'
3) Then at this point I would like to do further string search
   for other strings.... is it possible?

Is ';' recursive? How far can I go extracting strings from


Thanks,
Farid

Which entry did you add it to?  Which version of Pine?  Did you put a space
between the "Reply-To:" and the "username@address"?

I have been trying to get Pine to work properly on Novell's 
Unixware without much success. Unixware runs something called 
mailsurr instead of sendmail. If anyone has been successful 
getting Pine to run on Unixware, I would be grateful if you would 
share the secret of how it is done.

Thanks

You will note that once you have selected some messages, the prompt
on the next select ";" command will change and offer you the choice
to Unselect, Broaden or Narrow your selection. Narrow is basically
an AND (it will exclude some selected messages) and Broaded is an OR
( it will include more messages in the selected group. )

More specifically... the backslash tells sendmail that it's a system
mailbox, whereas without it, it tries to forward it a few dozen times
before it gives up (thirty, if I recall correctly).

Amazing how the "circular loop" logic is worked out with alias files
whereas the .forward can still confuse (one word, makealiaes?  *smile*)

Does Pine 3.89 and higher have an auto-read-mail-box feature so that you
don't have to go in and out of pine to get you new mail messages?

If so, how does one configure pine to do this? Elm does this, so I should
think Pine can do it also ??

Please e-mail your response.

Thank's in advance.

I am using pine 3.90 (yeah I know) on SunOS 4.1.3.  Occasionally when
responding to a mail message with no Newsgroups header when I type ^X to
send it, pine tells me "Message may go out to millions of users....".  If I
tell it no, go bak into the editor and try again, it does not give me the
message.  Examination of the headers in Rich Header Mode shows a blank
Nwsgrps or similar spelling header.

What is the heuristic that is tripping it up?  Has this bug been fixed in
3.91?

   Personally I hate instead typing full e-mail addresses and could
   not live without nicknames since the times of Bitnet/IBM Rice Mail.
   Pine is much better than any other mailing s/w I've seen on Unix.
   I like using nicknames, and I like the fact Pine produces headers
   with both the e-mail address and the person true name.

   I personally do not have any doubt in thinking a nickname for
   any "every little entry", I usually use the person name, surname
   or e-mail username (but I'd never again have to remember the node
   and domain !).
   I even use nicknames for local users, so that Pine may include the
   user full name.

go?

If you are a new user to News and don't already have a .newsrc file then
it
seems a rather tedious selection process, unless I'm missing a vital
point.

It seems that you select a newsgroup confirm that you want to subscribe,
then
have to choose subscribe again at which point you are back at the top of
the
list of all possible newsgroups. You then need to either page forward or
search
for a string until you get back to where you where. Then the whole
procedure
starts all over again.

I know you can give a string to base your selection procedure on a
particular
group, but that's only useful if you know what you're looking for.

Is it possible to use the relatively new aggregate command that is now
available in Pine to select a number of newsgroups and subscribe in a
oner?

Your Subject says "Sun Binary".  Is this a binary obtained from Washington
or is it one that you have compiled yourself?  Is it for Solaris 2.x or
SunOS 4.1.x?  If it's for Solaris 2.x, then I think this is caused by a
what I think is a bug in Solaris 2.3. 

The file pine/reply.c has the generate_message_id function. It uses the
value of ps->hostname.  This value is set up by init_hostname in init.c.
The function init_hostname calls getdomainnames to generate this value. 
The function getdomainnames is defined in pine/osdep/domnames.  It uses
gethostbyname.  I believe that the Solaris 2.3 gethostbyname does not 
return a FQDN.  Please tell me if I am wrong!

It is the Sun OS binary from Washington.

Ordinarily I would not be asking.  I would just compile the source. 
However, somewhere on the path between here and Seattle there is a lot of
packet loss so I have not been able to ftp the source.  (It took 2 hours
to get the binary :-( )

Subject: Newbie question 'bout ^_ , alternate editor


Hello all, 
	I'm using PINE 3.91 on AIX, but with a VT (420) terminal. It

   appears to me that this keyboard cannot send a control-underscore.

   Has anyone else out there figured out a way around this.  I've 

   enabled the alternate editor implicitly for now, but I still like to

   use PINE's regular editor most of the time, and emacs occasionally.

	Thanks,

	Ami Setton, RGTI Systems/Software

Date: Tue, 8 Nov 1994 14:21:46
Message-Id: <black.307.000E5D58@csulb.edu>

Pine behaves differently on two of our systems. 

On an Ultrix system running pine 3.88, it automatically converts
a naked address to a full alias and address.  That is, if I type
"black" on the To: line, it is automatically converted to
"Matthew Black <black@csulb.edu>".

On an SGI IRIX 5.2 system running pine 3.90 and the same
global pine configuration file .pinerc, it doesn't perform the
automatic conversion of a naked address.  

Can anyone offer advice why these systems behave differently?

The behave differently because much has changed between 3.88 and 3.90.

In fact, the way the .pinerc defines and handles the situation that
you describe has changed from 3.90 to 3.91.

Suggest you upgrade all of your systems to 3.91 and then check out the
options "Use-Only-Domain-Name" and "quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file".

This particular question was pretty specific to the VMS port, but in general
I don't mind seeing general VMS Pine questions on pine-info/comp.mail.pine. 
Where VMS Pine questions and bug reports should not be sent is to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu, though we will forward them along...

The above works like *yumm* for me, thanks to The Pine Team for 3.90
But one _glitch_ with this is, when you invoke Rich Headers and then
postpone the composition, upon resumption it cuts off my Suggest/Disclaimer
header values. This I have been told has been fixed in 3.91 (haven't had a
chance to get that to compile on MIPS-211AC)

If you do have any problem with getting this to work, send me an e-mail.

Can we have a FAQ?  Pine has no clue about mail filtering.  You have to 
find out what your local system offers.  My system filters mail through 
elm and filter.  Ask your sysadm.

If you want to put your outgoing mail in a folder, set default-fcc.

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

Subject: What is Pine?

   Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for
   reading, sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed
   specifically with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored
   to accommodate the needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses
   Internet message protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and
   runs on Unix and PCs. 
  
   The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful
   limitation of features, one-character mnemonic commands,
   always-present command menus, immediate user feedback, and high
   tolerance for user mistakes.  It is intended that Pine can be learned
   by exploration rather than reading manuals.  It has the ability to
   perform full screen editing of messages, attachments (such as Word or
   Excel files), and other advanced message system features. 

   Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and
   MIME for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to
   normal messages. 

   
------------ 
Content-Description: What is MIME?

Subject: What is MIME?

   MIME (RFC 1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It
   is an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
   (word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between
   any compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME
   from the RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
   comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list
   that is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime and comp.answers. 
   
------------
Content-Description: What is IMAP?

Subject: What is IMAP?

   IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client
   program on any platform at any location on the Internet can access
   email folders on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be
   local, they reside on the server until the client explicitly moves or
   deletes them.  The IMAP protocol is a functional (but incompatible)
   superset of POP. A principal advantage of IMAP over POP is that it
   permits using more than one computer to access your mail.  Using
   multiple computers with POP typically results in your mail ending up
   scattered across all of those computers. Another key advantage is
   IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages, e.g. you
   don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved until
   you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
   dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see
   the paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP
   vs. POP."
  
   IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email
   on a remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or
   departmental).  There is an IETF working group currently defining the
   IMAP4 revision to the IMAP2 specification (RFC-1176).  A copy of the
   latest IMAP draft may be obtained from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
   file imap/latest-imap-draft

------------ 
Content-Description: How can I get a copy of Pine?

Subject: How can I get a copy of Pine?

   Pine is available via anonymous ftp from the pine directory of
   ftp.cac.washington.edu. See the Installation Instructions for Pine for
   more information. 
   
------------
Content-Description: Is there a manual?

Subject: Is there a manual?

   The Pine program itself includes extensive online help.  Additional
   documentation may be found via anonymous FTP or via World-Wide-Web
   using the following URLs: 

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

   The Pine program itself also includes extensive online help. Other
   forms of access are planned for the future. 
   
------------
Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

   The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is
   bi-directionally gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described
   below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.
          
          For official announcements only, you may wish to see
          pine-announce instead of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with

   Pine-Announce@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Announce is a announcement list for the email program
          Pine. When new Pine products are released and old ones updated,
          a message goes out to this group describing the development. It
          is a very low volume list and includes no discussion
          whatsoever.
          
          _All messages to this list are automatically forwarded to
          pine-info, so it is not necessary to subscribe to both lists._

   In an attempt to avoid confusion with real places or services we
   decided to make up a ficticious user for our examples. This person is
   John Smith, who is currently an art major at the University of Nowhere
   (nowhere.edu). He previously attended Elsewhere Community College
   (elsewhere.edu). His username is jsmith and he uses the following

Subject: How many sites use Pine?

                                       

   We don't have a good way to count the number of sites running Pine,
   but at last count over 4,000 sites in 40 countries had downloaded the
   Pine 3.89 distribution from ftp.cac.washington.edu. There are also
   several major archive sites that mirror the distribution, so the
   actual numbers are probably much higher.

Subject: I have found a bug in Pine 3.05. Could you please fix it?

                                       

   When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
   possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point
   that a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't
   reproduce the problem in the current version, our standard response
   will be to ask you to upgrade.

Content-Description: If I postpone a Reply, there is no 'A' in the index after I resume and send it.

Subject: If I postpone a Reply, there is no 'A' in the index after I resume and send it.

                                       

   This is a known limitation of the current release of pine. When you
   postpone a composition, Pine does not have any way to keep track of
   which message was being replied to (or that it was a reply at all).
   This limitation will be removed in a future release of Pine. 
   
------------
Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

   The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"
   means that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in
   which it expected a start-of-message header line, it found something
   else.
   
   The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
   All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine.
   
   Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
   itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the
   problem go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the
   folder and see what is wrong with the very first line. In particular,
   make sure that there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file
   and that the first character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' ,
   the second an ``r'', the third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an 
   INBOX, you may want to rename the folder so that new mail can be
   delivered while repairs on the corrupt folder are being done. 
   
   Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g.
   /bin/mail) which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the
   beginning of the new data.
   
   Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail
   folder without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This
   is a general problem on UNIX. 
   
   Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
   folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
   system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
   attribute caching.
   
   Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3).
   If the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to
   determine its cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some
   external software. The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2)
   and (3) is that it does not want to risk damaging user data by
   guessing what is right. Pine never writes to the folder unless it is
   absolutely sure it knows what it is doing.
   
   There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
   conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance
   of your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and
   installed Pine on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

   Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
   occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the
   file at the same time.
   
   Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
   UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity.
   
   There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
   There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
   On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call
   it used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of
   lock file as well, but this has not been directly verified.
   
   _NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
   basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
   systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are
   known problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an
   application beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it).
   All of the above mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

   This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With
   the default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will
   get full access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be
   changed to read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not
   see any further updates to that folder until it is reopened with full
   access. Currently the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and
   restarting Pine. With the Tenex format, any number of sessions can
   simultaneously have full access to a folder, with the exception that
   expunging is disabled. See "What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I
   use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

   The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine
   has discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing
   your mail folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level
   lock used by programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail,
   and by certain programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly,
   this lock is only to be acquired and held for a very short period of
   time (less than a second).
   
   It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that
   message every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the
   time that it will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is
   false -- that is, that whatever program locked the folder forgot to
   unlock it (perhaps it crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the
   lock for itself.
   
   This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
   interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
   _NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting
   to open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will
   trigger this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters
   or less on those systems._

Subject: Why is a charset=US-ASCII attachment sent using BASE64 encoding?



   Pine BASE64-encodes all attachments, including text, in order to
   assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make sure
   file attachment in Pine is as dependable as FTP (and BASE64 is safer
   than Quoted-Printable). A good example of why this is handy is when we
   recently asked some folks to attach their addressbooks to help us
   track down problems in 3.90, we didn't have to worry about whether a
   gateway had modified a tab or trailing blanks, etc, etc.

   you compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other
   people's INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

                                       

   Here are a couple ways to use Ispell within Pine: 
    1. Set your alternate-editor to ispell, then ^_ in the composer
       invokes ispell. To do this set "editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell" in
       your .pinerc file. This may be set within Pine via the _OPTIONS_
       task of the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.
       
       Now, when you press ^_ (Control-Underscore) in Pine, you will
       execute the ispell program in its native mode. Press ? for help.
       Press I to insert unknown words into the personal dictionary. You
       can still press Ctrl-T to use the standard pine spell-checking
       program (which will -not- use your personal dictionary). See 'man
       ispell' for more information on the ispell program.
       
    2. Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable so you can
       create the following script and name it spell. 
       

     #!/bin/sh
     ispell -l | sort | uniq 

   To make Ctrl-T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words'
       dictionary: 
          + make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory 
          + make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell' 
          + set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL
            $HOME/spell' (you may include this command in your .profile,
            .cshrc or .login file) 
   
       
       Now, when you press Ctrl-T in Pine, you will execute the ispell
       program, and it will recognize words stored in the private
       dictionary. The screen display will look like pine is using the
       standard spell-checking program. Unfortunately, this method does
       not allow the user to Insert words into the private dictionary.
       However, this might be useful with a central script file (setenv
       SPELL ...) and a central private dictionary (ispell -p ...) to
       provide a common private dictionary for an entire workgroup. The
       manager could add items to the private dictionary; ordinary pine
       users would use the private dictionary (Ctrl-T), but they could
       not change it. 
       
   To use ispell with pico, implement the 'ispell' program via ^T
   (CTRL-T) (using the script file) in addition to implementing it via ^_
   (CTRL-_) (using the .pinerc file). 
     * Use Ctrl-_ in Pine (it won't work in Pico) for full-featured
       ispell. 
     * Use Ctrl-T in Pico to use the ispell program and your
       .ispell_words dictionary (but without the full ispell
       functionality). 
       
   You can use Ctrl-T/ispell in Pine also, but why bother when Ctrl-_
   works better.

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?

                                       

   Three ways to access news via Pine: 
    1. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       

        news-collections=News *[*]

   
       
    2. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]

   
       
       Alternatively, if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from the same server.
       
       
    3. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]

   
       
   The advantage of option #3 is that the same .newsrc can be used for
   both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
   account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

   Pine does not currently support this directly, but here is a
   work-around: 
    1. Move the cursor to the Cc: line. 
    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line. 
    4. Move the cursor where you want it in the body of the message. 
    5. Press Ctrl-U to insert the address. 
       
   This is kind of a round-about way to get the job done, but it works...

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

   Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
   programs, such as "procmail", or "filter" or "deliver".
   
   Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "filter"
   program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
   mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX.
   
   So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
   message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has
   created? Pine's answer is to let you specify them in your .pinerc, as
   in the example:
   
    
   
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

   In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
   program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class
   into the folder "filter/to-art151" and mail relating to the Art-L
   mailing list into "filter/to-Art-L". 
   
   From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those
   folders. Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may
   have new mail waiting for you, so that you don't "forget" that you
   have more than one place to look for new mail...

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
   Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of
   Pine. If you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients
   already, the following information may be useful. 
  
   The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
   authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication
   is designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with
   alternative authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
   This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of
   c-client you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the
   name of your port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is
   included by the os_xxx.c file.
   
   The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it
   may be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only
   contains that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify
   that file and rebuild imapd.

   No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail
   model (wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the
   local machine and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely
   that this model will be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or
   POP as the access protocol, in a future release.

Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

                                       

   Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or
   mulitple users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost*
   full Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW
   access is that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no
   one can do an Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a
   msg as deleted) *can* be done, and this state is preserved across
   sessions. 
   
   If an explicit Expunge cmd fails, it will say so and tell you that the
   mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session
   left using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again.
   
   In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW
   client at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session
   steals the RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier
   session becoming RO.

Subject: Where does Unix Pine look for configuration information?

  
                                     
   In Pine 3.90, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the Main Menu) contain
   a section on Configuration, including default file names and
   environment variables. 

   In brief, Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide
   file /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, a system-wide non-overridable file
   /usr/local/lib/pine.fixed, and a personal configuration file
   ~/.pinerc. There are certain options which are only found in system
   wide configurations, others only found in personal configurations, and
   still others found in both. For settings found in both pine.conf and
   .pinerc, values in .pinerc take precedence over those in pine.conf, 
   and settings in pine.conf.fixed take precedence over everything.
   
   If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide
   configuration files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib ". Pine
   automatically generates a .pinerc when a user starts Pine for the
   first time.

   In Pine 3.90, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the Main Menu) contain
   a section on Configuration, including default file names and

   In brief, PC-Pine uses the following rules for finding config and
   support files: 

    1. The location of the PINERC is searched for in the following order

         1. File pointed to by PINERC environment variable 
         2. $HOME\PINE\PINERC 
         3. A file named PINERC in the same directory as PINE.EXE 
    2. The HOME environment variable, if not set, defaults to root of the
       current working drive. 
    3. The default for external files (PINE.SIG and ADDRBOOK) is the same
       directory as the PINERC file. 
    4. The support files (PINE.HLP and PINE.NDX) are searched for in the 
       same directory as PINE.EXE.

Subject: How do I make Pine work with my older terminal?

                                       

   Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
   well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
   others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?

                                       

   You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: How can someone without a MIME-aware mail program decipher an attachment?

                                       
   

   Regarding attachments: Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for this.
   MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) uses "Base64" encoding
   rather than uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are
   transformed by some email gateways, and there are also several
   incompatible versions of uuencode.
   
   However, you can certainly uuencode a file outside of pine, then use
   the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert the encoded
   file in the message.
   
   If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient does need to have
   MIME-capable software. Fortunately, this is not hard to find. Even the
   major proprietary mail vendors have committed to MIME support, but
   some of their upgraded products are still some months away. One
   product which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available from ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the /pub/mpack
   directory.

Subject: How do I convert a Sun Mailtool attachment to MIME format?

                                       

   A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows
   mail to MIME. Body parts currently supported are: text, gif, Sun
   rasterfile (converted to image/gif), postscript, and audio. Other
   types default to application/octet-stream. It's easy to extend the set
   of types supported and to add conversions, if necessary. 
   
   The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the
   "convert" program from ImageMagick. If you don't have ImageMagick you
   can probably substitute the pbm stuff with little fuss. 
   
   The program is available via ftp from cs.utk.edu in
   pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.perl or pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.c

   Here's a little script one of our UNIX folks worked up to handle
   conversion of elm aliases to pine alias form (pretty simple syntax
   substitution). If you execute it multiple times it will keep adding
   another set of your elm aliases to your pine addressbook.

I believe I've read all there is in the distribution
on imap, and I still have some questions.

- Is there some more documentation?
- Is it possible to set up a unix server such that PC
  clients can use POP to read the mail with the pop->imap programs?
- Are there any advantages/disadvantages of doing this over a regular POP3?
- Are there any other PC clients that support IMAP besides PINE (as he ducks)?

I like the look of IMAP, but I need to support whatever the client has on
the PC.

Thanks,

Take a multiuser machine, say a Sun 4/370. If it can support N pc users 
who telnet in and run a continuous pine session, it can presumably 
support M x N pc users were they all to adopt an IMAP based PC mua. Any 
guesses on the value of M? (We get N up to 40 or so on the model suggested).

	Yes, get the RFC.  (I don't recall the number....but I guess that
is why the rfc index is helpful).

	I know ECSMail, a commercial product, relies on IMAP.

	What's the big deal?  There is no law that say you can't support
both IMAP an POP.  My systems support POP2, POP3, and IMAP.

How much conventional DOS memory does PC-Pine need to run reliably? I've
been having problems trying it out on a 386 with about 530K free and I'd
really like to be able to give it to users who have even less. Is this a

Since Pine 3.85 I have had trouble running PINE with curses linked in on 
various terminal types we have here.  Specifically Pine would somehow 
manage to change the baud rate of the tty or just lock up the terminal 
entirely as soon as the user went into Compose (but not the mail Index).

Basically the way to fix it is to comment out "#define POSIX_SIGNALS" in os.h

It doesn't seem to have any adverse reactions and curses now works, 
instead of having to use termcap.

I have noticed another problem concerning interrupted messages which at 
least two users have encountered but I have not been able to duplicate.
The users somehow have a file in their home directory called 
.pine-interrupted-mail containing 0 bytes, and a second file called 
.pine-interrupted-mail.lock also containing 0 bytes.  When they try to 
continue these interrupted messages they get kicked out of Pine with the 
message Pine Bug detected or something similar to that.
When I try it by creating those files in my home dir with 0 bytes, i 
don't get pine bug detected but it does tell me that it can't delete that 
folder.  I don't know how they managed to get .pine-interrupted-mail with 
0 bytes but it does happen I guess.

Hi There,

I have a problem with Pine 3.91 in that I can't forward or reply to a
message.  When I try to do either I get an error message that says 'Can't
Reply to message. Error accessing folder'.  I normally use Mailstrom for
mail (a Macintosh IMAP program), and have Pine configured for IMAP, and
have no problem getting into my mail.  I've double checked all of the
permissions on every possible folder (/usr/spool/mail/jeff, ~jeff/mail,
/tmp, etc.). I have even tried running the debugger at 9, but it never
told me what folder it was having problems opening, it just says 'Error
accessing folder...'

Any assistance to this problem would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff Petry

If you have the TZ environment variable set, try getting rid of it and see what 
happens. This was the problem with v3.90, but it was solved in v3.91.

You're right (although I think it is 'does not always', depending on the
/etc/hosts file ?). From the Solaris Porting FAQ (you'll find it in your
nearest news.answers repository, directory Solaris2, file porting-FAQ):

       *      gethostbyname() always returns null in h->aliases.
         *      Now, gethostbyX can be replaced its __switch_gethostbyX
         *      equivalents. However, these are missing from Solaris 2.3.

And then a replacement routine (by Casper Dik) to "plug it in every program
that requires gethostbyname to work" (only header shown here):

        /*
         *     Proper gethostbyXX function for Solaris 2.0-2.3
         *     (and later ?) 
         *
         *     Fixed in 2.4?
         *
         *     You'll need -ldl added to the link command line.
         *
         *     Casper Dik (casper@fwi.uva.nl)
         *
         */

I've heard rumours that this indeed is fixed in 2.4 (but I'm not sure).

Anyway, I once put the replacement routine somewhere in the Pine code and my
message-ID's suddenly got FQDN's in it. Don't ask me where I put it, I'm not
a C-programmer and probably picked the 'wrong' place ;-)

Does anybody have success with procmail?  I compiled it, but have no idea

but it doesn't say anything about pine.

Thanks!

Firstly, a question: 

	What does sorting by OrderedSubj do? I can't work that one out. 

Secondly, a recommendation (well, just sommat I've noticed, really): 

	How about if .pinerc actually reflected compile-time options you
set. e.g., from my .pinerc: 

# Default: "default-fcc" (see also "default-fcc=" variable.)
fcc-name-rule=

Only it isn't. Default is "". Because I set it that way when I compiled
Pine. So I just thought maybe .pinerc should say: Default: ""

Sorting by "ordered subject" does a grouping intended to simulate a
"threaded" sort, and then presents each "thread" in order of the date
of the first message in the group.  Reverse simply reverses whatever the
current sort order is.

First of all, I would like to thank people who are/were involved in
the PINE development. It's great!

We have about 30 Unix workstations, we are using BSD-Sendmail on
our "mailhost" machine (the machine which were our incoming mail 
arrives) and mounting "/var/spool/mail" on the clients via NFS. We
experimented several problem in the past, probably associated
to NFS and Elm (inbox corrupted, an so on).

I had no problem with NFS and PINE, but it was not a *real* life
experiment (only a few users were using it).

Now, we are re-installing our mail services, and I was wondering 
if we couldn't use IMAP access from UNIX "clients", other than
from PCs.

(sorry for the long description of the problem)

My questions are:

1) To get IMAP access on Unix, I should configure in my ".pinerc"
   something like:

	inbox-path={mailhost}/var/spool/mail/my_user_name

   Is that all and right?         (it seems to work)

2) With the above configuration, PINE asks for "username" and "password"
   to open the INBOX. That check couldn't be avoided for the Unix users?
   Actually they have already logged on...

3) What are the (dis)advantages of using IMAP instead of NFS? Do 
   you recommend it?


Many thanks in advance,

    Marcos

Hello,

Is it too early to give suggestion for next
version of PINE?


It sure would be nice if there was a history mechanism
so I could re-visit folders I have already been in a 
more user-friendly fashion ...

Thanks,
Farid

Yes, I did put a space after the colon.  I have gotten about a dozen 
e-mails telling me to do this.  I did it when I originally tried to add 
the header.  Also, I tried it without the username@site part.  No luck.

Can someone send me a .pinerc that works for them with added headers?

USING PINE 3.90 and yes I put the added header just as I put it in my 
last message, (below).  If anyone has done this successfully I would like 
to see your .pinerc file.

Any help would be great, but a .pinerc with the proper syntax or whatever 
would be great too.

A couple of pine questions:

Is there a way to "re-send" a message that is in your "sent-mail" folder 
WITHOUT using "forward"?  Forwarding it adds a header, etc. to the 
message.  If I just want to RE-SEND it in its original format (so the 
receiver) doesn't know it's the second time around, is that possible?  I 
realize you can edit out those "forward" lines, but I would think there 
would be an easier way in pine.  Is there?

I also notice that when I post to newsgroups, it seems to take a LONG 
time when I'm entering newsgroup names in the "Newsgrps:" header.  Is 
there a way to speed this up?  I noticed a few newsgroups options in the 
Config, but wasn't sure which, if any, would speed this up.  Is there 
something?

Thanks for any help or information you can provide.

Does anybody have a filter which converts elm's aliases.text to pine
addressbook format? I guess it is pretty straight forward to do, but
it would save me some work if its been done already.

Is it right that there can be only one nickname per addressbook entry?
Elm allows several.

Finally, is there a FAQ for comp.mail.pine?

Yes. Just save to the postponed-msgs folder, and go Compose, and it 
appears as a continued postponed compose.

We have had this too on some of our systems. The answer is that it all 
depends what MTA you use. Pine uses the sendmail -t option to tell 
(actually ask!) the MTA to strip the Bcc field. The MTA may or may not do 
this (as it is not strictly its business to do anything to the inside of 
a message). A discussion in comp.mail.headers suggests that the only 
proper specification is for the MUA (PINE in this instance) to strip out 
the Bcc field itself.

I recall a message about 3.90 not working if you had the TZ variable 
set...I think it was on the fix list for 3.91

That's okay.

we are experiencing unexplained freezes when entering the header info
in the composer to create a message to be posted. 

my current header set (^r display)

To, Cc, Bcc, Newsgrps, Fcc, Attchmnt, Subject, Return-Receipt-To, 
Organization

any thoughts on how to correct this  would be very welcome.

also looking for help in how to setup a list of x-post newsgroups.

tried using the addressbook list and newsgrps:  header doesnt 
check the addressbook for the list. 

thanks...

Hi there,

Today I tried to install Pine 3.89 on my server running Motorola V / 88 (=AT&T

Is there a possibility to install Pine on SVR3.2 ?

Thanks in advance.

I've recently installed pine 3.90 on our SGI Challenge L server running
the IRIX 5.2 operating system (System V family of Unix).  It was built using 
the command:
   ./build sgi EXTRADRIVERS=mbox

When I try to post to a UseNet news group, I get the following error 
message: "Error posting message: 441 Can't parse 'Date' header".
Is this a known bug or just a problem with IRIX 5.2?

We recently implemented Pine 3.91, having upgraded from 3.89
Our host systems use SunOS 4.1.2.

After being in place for about a week, we have started getting
reports from users of the subject error message. Currently, these
are very sporadic reports and there is no common thread of actions
or circumstance that we have been able to determine.

We experienced a similar, albeit much more pervasive, problem
while testing 3.90. A workaround to that problem, posted here, 
involved recompiling with a switch that allowed string "constants"
to be modified--can't remember the exact switch wording.

QUESTIONS:
   1. Has anyone experienced a similar problem and/or know of 
causes/fixes?
   2. Since the problem in 3.90 was apparently set off by an error
in parsing the value of an entry in the .pinerrc file, I wonder if
there could be a problem induced by allowing Pine 3.91 to update
a user's .pinerc instead of renaming the (3.89) one and having Pine
create a fresh one. Anyone care to comment?

Respondents can post an answer here, but I'd sure like to have replies
emailed to me--dbateman@sol.acs.unt.edu. If I get a bunch of suggestions,
advice, fixes, workarounds, etc. I'd be glad to summarize them for the
newsgroup.

Thanks much.

If I use the released "build sun" every thing works fine except that pine 
won't lookup the name of the nntp-server in the DNS.

As we are using "resolve+" on this machine I tried to re-link c-client
and pine with "-lresolv" added to the link statements.
This produced the following error:

ld: Undefined symbol
   _inet_aton
*** Error code 2
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `pine'


Has anyone had a similar problem?
Can anyone offer any suggestions?

If you are on a unix platform, try using the unix vacation command.  It 
does exactly what you described.

Does anybody know where I can either get a compiled version of Pine for

Pine doesn't know about mail filtering.  You have to find out how your 
system filters mail.  My system uses a program called 'filter'.

	The problem is on the mailer, though PINE could do the honours as

	The address-list that is used to send the piece of email, and letter

	Let's see.....I think that makes 379 times this question has
been asked this week.  :-) :-)

	And the answer still is.....

------------
Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

   Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
   programs, such as "procmail", or "filter" or "deliver".
   
   Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "filter"
   program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
   mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX.
   
   So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
   message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has
   created? Pine's answer is to let you specify them in your .pinerc, as
   in the example:
   
    
   
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

   In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
   program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class
   into the folder "filter/to-art151" and mail relating to the Art-L
   mailing list into "filter/to-Art-L". 
   
   From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those
   folders. Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may
   have new mail waiting for you, so that you don't "forget" that you
   have more than one place to look for new mail...

I find that ^K/^U does indeed work, used the right way. What I would do 
is to 
a) reply including text
b) edit the line in the text so that only the email address is in the line
(alternatively use ^^ and arrows to just highlight the bit you want) 
c) ^K the cuts just the address, and ^U will instert just that
d) tidy up the message (remove included text and subject if not wanted).

Accessing remote folders via NFS, particularly the INBOX is _discouraged_. 
There are unavoidable locking problems with NFS that are not present with
IMAP.

It would work, but 

	inbox-path={mailhost}INBOX

is the recommended form.

If you enable RSH access without a password, Pine will use it for
pre-authenticated access to the server.  Otherwise it falls back to using
port 143, wich requires a login procedure.

There may be some slight performance gains from NFS, but IMAP performs better
under some circumstances too.  As mentioned above, folder locking actually
works over IMAP, so you don't have to worry about corrupted folders due to
failed locks.  If you have a dedicated server that does not allow interactive
logins for general users, you can also take advantage of alternate folder
formats (e.g. Tenex) with improved performance and better shared access.

: In Pine, I want to pull in an ASCII text file and use it as a message. 
: For example, I have a file called test.txt and want the contents of that
: file to go to joe@dec5000.  Is this possible?  How do I do that?

At Pine's opening screen, press A for Addressbook.  Locate the cursor 
onto your target's email address, then type:

		C^Rtest.txt^Xy

: Also, I want to to put a file in the users mail directory and it appear as
: a new message to him/her.  Is this possible?  If so, what format does the
: file have to be in (ASCII?).

Mail it to him/her as uuencoded 7-bit ascii.

This comment (which I already knew about) has just raised an interesting 
flag in my mind...

Here we are currently using the mbox driver.  This means that newly 
arrived mail (which arrives in the file /var/mail/username in IRIX 5) is 
moved by Pine or imapd into a file called "mbox" in the user's home 
directory.

Currently all users' home directories and the /var/mail store itself are 
accessed over NFS.  We know of the inherent problems (and indeed have 
fallen foul of them once or twice).  We are looking to set up a separate 
mail server which has the /var/mail store on a local disk and which runs 
the imapd's to access it.  Then we would reconfigure Pine to use IMAP for 
mail access.

However what about the mbox driver?  This will still be making use of the 
"mbox" file in the users' home areas.  These are held on our Auspex file 
server and would need to be NFS mounted on the mail server machine.

Is there still a file locking problem here?

We really do need to use the mbox driver in order to force people to be 
selective about the mail they keep (the /var/mail disk doesn't have disk 
quotas enabled to ease mail delivery problems, but users' areas do have 
them turned on).

If there is a problem can someone suggest a way forward?

I have a slight permutation on this thread. As a postmaster of several 
conferences, I want to send a standard file in my directory to one-time

Thanks very much.

    Will Pine3.92 also write folder copies of sent mail with full 8-bit
data instead of the Q-P used now, or would the fcc reflect the data
spoken to the 8BITMIME or non-8BITMIME server (if mail was passed off as
Q-P it would also be written as such), or will it still be Q-P?

The following .signature contains 8-bit data sent to the pine-info

Is this a definition of bcc: I was previously unaware of or am I missing 
something? I sent something to a dozen people, and to avoid cluttering up 
their screens, I bcc:ed everyone except one of them. However, every 
single one of them got the full distribution list with the bcc: header. I 
am using MMDF as my mail server, if that helps.

Thanks for any input,

Hi,

Could some one please help us with our elm problem:

We are using elm version 2.4 Patch level 23 on a Sun sparc platform
running Solaris 2.3. It seems that elm occasionally disappears without
anyone terminating it or exiting from it. It just vanishes. There is a
message, however, appears on the screen about alarm clock problem. 

I will appreciate any help. 

with best regards

Message-Id: <3a0msg$moj@xmission.xmission.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to help my brother log on to his new internet
srver (eskimo.com) and he is having problems with pine.
We've tried several different terminal emulations, vt100,
ibmxxx, etc etc and some work ok with everything else at
eskimo but when it comes time to use pine he gets a message
saying that this terminal is not supported by pine or else he
gets garbled blah blah blah.
Anybody out there that can help us figure out what
to do to get his IBM XT to work with pine?
Many many thanks!
Bret

First it sorts by subject, then it sorts the groups of messages with the 
same subject by the date of the oldest message in the group.  So it is 
the same as sort by subject except that the new "threads" are later in 
the index than the old "threads".

This makes sense but probably isn't worth changing at this point.  It 
used to be that people looked at their pinerc files and edited them but 
now most people change configs with the Setup/Config screen.

   Is there a config setting that will cause the distribution to show up
in the header while I'm composing a message?  Is there a way to set the
distribution default to "world"?  Finally, is it possible to do a followup
posting WITHOUT emailing the person you're responding to?  None of these
is a problem with nn, but I'd like to be able to continue to use pine to
read and post newsgroups.

Thanks,

For anyone who has setup Pine 3.89 for VAX/VMS, how can you use
system-wide distribution lists for everyone to use?

The addressbook is only for personal use, is there a way to have some
alias for distribution lists everyone on a mail system can use.

If you look at the Help in Pine for the To: propmt, it says you can use a
system-wide alias, but that is for a Unix machine.

If any System Administrator on a VAX/VMS has done this before, there help
would be greatly appreciated

FAQ!

Please read the FAQ,
question "2.19 Can I use elm for posting and replying to news?"

Well, ELM is an mail transport agent - not a newsreader.

"Post follow-up message to news group(s)?"

The docs say you can suppress this prompt if you want Pine to 
assume you DO want to post as well as reply. What if you DON'T?

How the heck can you turn it off entirely *without Pine assuming
you want to post too?*

People used to the older version just bang on "y" when they see
a prompt while replying. I've already seen one case of private
email accidentally posted to a group because of this dangerous
flexibility in Pine. I expect to see more such choice morsels.

But it was embarrassing to those concerned. It would be an even
more flexible program if this feature could be disabled with a
do NOT post default.

Thanks for any and all help.

How are you going to support a reply WITH post then?

Dangerous flexibility? How about people-who-don't-bother-to-read are 
dangerous? You mean they also always reply with included message AND to 
all recipients? Probably the same people who publicly post those very 
informing 'Thank you for your reply' on mailing lists.

There are two ways to learn things: inform yourself beforehand, and by 
trial-and-error.

I guess those concerned know better now.

This sounds like a harsh reply (well, it is) but I just think that Pine 
should not be changed for every user that has some problem he/she created 
on his/her own. A UI still requires some thought of its user, we haven't  
any UI's connected directly to our brains yet.

I have just arrived at a new UNIX/PINE system. I know little or nothing 
about this configuration. I arrive with fairly extensive experience with 
the VAX/VMS system, and I especially miss the SELECT command. I FTP'd to 
the washington site and got a couple of files, and am muddling through. I
have about 100 messages arriving daily, but have some very specific needs 
in order to make this a faster process.

First I want to see in the index the name of the server, primarily the 
FROM address, but I also want to be able to sort by the TO or CC 
addresses as well. How may I do that?

I wish to use the ";" select command in order to do aggregate commands.
How may I do that?  I want to save entire folders of email into plain
ASCII/dos text files, all at one time. How may I do that?  The version of
PINE which is used here is version 3.89.  

Any and all assistance and
mentoring greatly appreciated.

Elm "disappears"?
What do you mean?

1)  The window which showed Elm disappers.
2)  Elm disappears from the window which showed it, but the window now
    displays a shell (or whatever).
3)  Elm disappeared from the process list.
4)  Elm disappeared from the hard disk.
5)  I can't find the manuals.

>There is a message, however, appears on the screen about alarm clock problem. 

Huh?

On the server, put a link between where you have the imapd binary and 
/usr/etc/rimapd

e.g

ln -s /usr/local/etc/imapd /usr/etc/rimapd


That will allow the pine client to use rsh instead of an imap connection 
(i.e. no password required).

Advantages of IMAP: 	- doesn't need NFS ;-)
			- No more worries about file locking - which is 
			broken under quite a few commercial implementations 
			of NFS
			- faster than NFS

Disadvantages:		- slower than NFS

UDP-based NFS is inherently faster than TCP-based IMAP, but there's a 
gotcha. If you receive heaps of large MIME messages (Framemaker 
attachments/etc), then IMAP should be faster on indexing than NFS as the 
indexing is done locally with IMAP, but remotely (i.e. other end of NFS 
link) with NFS. I think that 99% of the time NFS should still be faster 
though...

What do I need to run PC PINE on my home machine and where can I find it?  I
know a friend who is trying to get it to work on his system and he's missing
the TCP/IP driver PINE says it needs in order to run.  Why wouldn't this have
been in the PINE package?

I'd like to run PINE as a stand-alone for now as I do not have SLIP or PPP
access as of yet.  I want to manage my mail off-line rather than store it
online and waste space.

Thanks,
Mike

Hi,
I tried to install pine on a sunOs 5.3 machine using "build sv4" (I tried
"build sun" as well, but this was even worse). Everything (mtest, imapd and
pico) is working fine, but not Pine. The following lines appear on the
screen:

	Not sure I know what your mean by "name of the server".

	At this point you can only sort on "From:".

	Well, part of your problem is you are running 3.89.  There are
much more features in 3.91.

	Suggest you upgrade to 3.91, read *all* of the extensive help
menus, get the FAQ and read that, play around for a bit, then take
stock of where you are at.  Then, come back with any and all questions.
(Is that known as "mentoring" ?  :-) :-) )

	You should be using "build sol".  You may also have to check to
see that the CFLAGS= variable in the makefile.sol contains -Dconst=
After that it should build fine.  Also, take care that your environment
does *not* define LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/ucb/lib.

We recently built Pine on our NCR system running SVR4 and the MetaWare
High C Compiler. The generated binary appears to work OK but we find that
over a period of days our memory utilization (sar -g) goes to heck. If
we reboot the system everything returns to normal. If we stop using Pine for
a couple of days we get no system performance deterioration. When we resume,
so does the degradation.
 
QED it seems that Pine is the culprit and our conclusion is that there must
be some kind of memory leak. Any ideas?

I have a few Suggestions for upcoming versions of pine..

1) Show how many new messages are new for NewsGroups..

2) Allow different sorting for Regular Mail folders, and News Folders

3) Allow crossposting for Newsgroups...

4) Allow a move prompt to move News Folders Around so that you can change 
your reading order.  (Changing them in the .newsrc is too much of a pain)

5) Allow multiple Subscribe/Unsubscribe tags when adding a Newgroup, 
insteadof adding one at a time..

One way is to pipe the message through ``formail -ds'' and put the output 
into a folder.  E.g., while viewing the message do the following:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------
|                                 Pipe
formail -ds >> ~/mail/burst       Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a folder named
                                  ~/mail/burst.  (Replace ~/mail
                                  with your folder directory.)
g                                 Go to folder named...
burst                             burst


Note that in order for this to work you need to set enable-unix-pipe-cmd.

Hope this helps,
Nancy

Or if you are in Windows, either using a Windows comm program or a

I think David's request is a good one.  It would be nice if there were 
three variables, maybe called:

  enable-news-post-in-mail-folder
  news-post-without-validation-in-mail-folder
  news-post-without-validation-in-newsgroup

For what I think David wants he would have enable-news-post-in-mail-folder
*not* X'd.  I'd recommend having all three of them *not* X'd as the default.
To answer Richard's question about replying simultaneously through mail
and news, you would go to the newsgroup and reply to the message there
(that way you know that the message was actually posted so it is proper
netiquette to respond publicly).

Just an idea,
Nancy

Setup your pine to enable-bounce-command and then try out B.  It
should look like the original to the recipient even though a few
header lines were added.

I have stated before that I cannot imagine a situation in which I wanted to
answer yes.  I cannot find a reliable way to tell whether it was the
intention of the sender for the mail to be private or public.  I HAVE to
assume that if I received it in mail then it is private.  If the discussion
is to be carried on in public, then I would have encountered the message in
a newsgroup.  When I post a reply and cc it to the original poster
(something that is very easy to do with nn), I always alert the reader of
the mail message 

Posted and mailed.

I think the current behavior of pine is dangerous and useless and do not
want to take responsibility for the consequences and have therefore
refrained from installing it at my site, where I do almost all the free
software installation and maintenance.  The rest of the site is running
3.89.  The main reason I upgraded was for the new default alt editor
support. 

I want to be able to disable this behavior sitewide either at compile time
or with the site config file.

I have said this a number of times:  I can hardly imagine a case where this
is called for, appropriate OR needed.  Despite the insistence of many people
on this group to the contrary, many people prefer to think of mail as a
private activity, while posting is a public activity.  For those of us who
want it, pine should be configurable to be more mode oriented on this
issue.  This is almost as bad as Bcc's that aren't.

Frequently used tools should be configurable so that a minimum of care is
needed to insure reasonable default behavior, selectable by the sysadmin
and/or user.  One of the advantages of pine < 3.90 was that it had generally
less dangerous behavior than elm, partly from lessened flexibility in some
areas.

Cars should not be built with the control pedals interchanged, particularly
when they are touted to novices for their ease of use.  "We decided to put
the accelerator under the left foot because it takes less strength than the
clutch, which we put under the right foot."

All some of us are asking for is to make this insane behavior configurable.

And to fix Bcc.

Following up on my own request...

I received one script by email, which seems to work only in simple
cases, and I found something in the FAQ, where however the most
important part is missing. Meanwhile, I wrote my own perl script,
which I claim digests everything elm accepts and converts it into
something pine accepts. Please tell me if you find otherwise. I intend
to use this script regularly to keep system-wide aliases and
addressbooks in synch. It is appended below.

Since I haven't heard anything to the contrary, the script below
assumes this.

> Finally, is there a FAQ for comp.mail.pine?

I saw one in the meantime, but I still ask myself why it can't be
found in the usual places.

Finally, I want to apologize for the mangled From-headers of my
previous postings. It was due to a combination of a tin "feature" and
the way I used xterm, and I hope it is corrected with this posting.

And another thing about OS/2, you can do this under OS/2 whether you are 
using a PM (GUI) terminal emulator, or a character-based emulator.

Man.....

The only thing you have to do is answer 'no' to one of the questions. 
Make sure as installer that there is a system-wide config file which 
enables the question, and post a message when the next reading courses 
start.

Enabling the question is possible.

As your signature says, free software is the best, but you forgot to 
mention that you don't want to make any efforts using it.

	Is there a newsgroup/mailing list for VMS Pine (v3.89beta, not the
pmdf version)?  I can't seem to find an active newsgroup on my machine, but
I figured there might be a list.  I'm running pine under VMS v5.5 and using
mail/pmdf as a gateway since we don't run Multinet on our cluster.  Is this
version still being developed, or has it been replaced by the commercial
PMDF version?

Message-Id: <3a5r8j$2jk@cville-srv.wam.umd.edu>

Hi,

	I downloaded the file "pine-bin.ultrix" from ftp.cac.washington.edu
today.  The version was 3.91.  When I tried to run it, I got an ERROR on
opening INBOX.  It seem PINE does NOT use the variable "$USER" in the
inbox-path.  And I tried "echo $USER" at unix prompt, it return "bdan" to me.
The following is the system conf, .pinerc and .pine-debug1.  Please help,
Thanks!!

# /usr/local/lib/pine.conf

Chris,

Place the Individual recipient's address on the to line as normal.
Press the control button and r  for rich headers.
Place the other addresses or nicknames in the bcc field (blind carbon copy).
Send the message as normal.

This should accomplish what you're looking for.

Please forgive me if this is a FAQ, it seems rather important though so 
even if it is it probably deserves to be reiterated anyway :->
Does anyone have a method of converting .alias files to .addressbook 
format files?  It would be *really* annoying to have to do it by hand for 
around 500 entries!  Anyone got an old script laying about or something?
Please respond via E-amil, even if you post, as I really need an answer!
Thanks,

Hi,

	Considering some of the posts as of late I couldn't resist.

	Yesterday my wife, who is not computer literate (still thinks a
mouse belongs in a trap....humm...could be right there), spent some time
looking over my shoulder.  She had couple of analogies that I found
amusing.  I'll paraphrase:

	pine is like a VCR, it has lots of buttons and features....but
you rarely use more than a few.

	And my favorite....(after I explained about newsgroups):

	pine is like a VCR, it comes with a thick manual that nobody
reads and everyone complains because it doesn't work right.

	Regards,

			Ed and Hsiu-Inn

I'd like to offer some corrections to this.  Like most complex questions, 
there is no single ``best'' solution; to make an intelligent decision you 
have to have an understanding of the fundamental nature of the two 
mechanisms.

Byte-per-byte, NFS will be faster than IMAP because of the underlying
transport (UDP-based file access vs. transaction-based TCP).  What can tip
the balance in favor of IMAP is that IMAP avoids having to send
substantial amounts of data.  Specifically: 

1) IMAP never needs to send message data *back* to the folder when doing
   an EXPUNGE or folder checkpoint.

2) IMAP never needs to retrieve message data from messages that the user
   does not look at.  With NFS, you are effectively downloading the entire
   mailbox to the client.  With IMAP, it is access on demand.

3) IMAP permits server-based execution of certain operations (RFC822 parse,
   MIME parse, and searching) that can be difficult on some limited-resource
   clients and/or require downloading of data that may turn out to be
   uninteresting.

What are the implications of this?

1) IMAP is almost always better over low-speed links, such as SLIP, because
   of its fetch-on-demand nature.  I'll go out on a limb here, and say that
   based on my experience NFS is not viable unless you have a high-speed
   interconnect.

2) NFS is probably better for users whose model of mail is to read all 
   of it and delete it from the server; *provided* that the client has
   adequate memory to hold the data and avoid repeated NFS retrievals of
   the same data.

3) IMAP is better for users who have very large folders, read their new
   mail and keep their old mail in the folder for archival purposes.  You
   would not want to use a 5,000 message folder with NFS.

Of course, there are also the issues of synchronization of multiple
simultaneous access and locking which NFS, due to its stateless nature,
handles poorly.  These require state, and NFS is stateless.  This is why
the tenex format isn't supported over NFS.  SVR4 makes an attempt to
implement state for locking, but usually ends up falling flat on its face.

This is what I got when I asked that question.  It works for me.


------Begin Forward--------
There are some perl scripts around which you can use, but I find them a
little bulky, so I wrote this shellscript which does the job pretty
well.  It uses the Solaris2 version of 'echo', so if you're on a BSD
system, change any echo lines that end in \c to 'echo -n' and remove the
\c.  There might be a few \t's in the echo lines too.  These need to be
replaced with real tabs for BSD echo.
 
To integrate it into pine, put this script somewhere in your path (with
read & execute perms on it) and change the alternative editor to
'editpgp -i'.  Write your mail as normal, then enter the alternate
editor to handle signing and encryption.  (Just run 'editpgp' with no
args for info on command line args).  'editpgp -h' should be used with
applications like TIN which leave headers in the text to be edited.
 
The only bug(/feature?) with this script is that if you reply to
encrypted mail and include the message in the reply, the script doesn't
automatically decrypt the message for you.  I only wrote it because I
didn't like the perl scripts and I was bored, so I don't pretend it's
perfect, but it works pretty well and it's fast *;O)
 
        Mark.

>There is a message, however, appears on the screen about alarm clock problem. 

alarm clock is what appears when the alarm(x) system call is not
caught.  Elm posts an alarm, and its signal is what causes the screen
to refresh.  Alarm clock, followed by an exit means that the signal
handler was not configured correctly by the installer of Elm for your
system, and its not re-posting itself as the handler for the alarm
signal.   (IE: Its an installer's configure error.)  Using PL24,
this configuration option is not longer even used with the alarm
signal, so I'd say, upgrade to pl24.

We already run PMDF PINE which comes with PMDF.  For further contact
the Innosoft Corporation.  They do have an anonymous ftp site at
innosoft.com.

I'd like to know if there are other versions of pine for OpenVMS out
there, which don't require proprietary software?

We're running PMDF 4.3 on OpenVMS V5.5-2, and the PINE that comes with
it.  Since many of our users are migrating over to it I'm having to
become familiar with it.

Anyway, I've been trying to get it to include a signiture file and
it's not working.

I have placed the following entry in my PINE.PINERC file:
    signature-file=SYS$LOGIN:PINE.SIGNITURE
but it's not being included in my mail (sent to myself).  Are there
any known problems with it?

I was just looking thru my "sent-mail" folder, and I wanted to sort by
the name of the person the mail was sent to. Pine is kind enough to
display the most useful information (To: name@host), but I'd really like
to sort by that info as well.

Can anyone reading these lines help me get rid of a rapidly
flashing flip-flop nudnik?

I use Pine 3.91 from home, through my modem.

The trouble begins when I highlight a message in my INBOX
which I wish to print, press "Y" and answer "Yes" to Pine's
question ("Print to Ansi Printer?")

The printing commences--but so does an annoying, rapidly
flashing error message at the bottom of the screen, which I
cannot stop!

Sometimes, this nuisance continues unabated for so long, that
I must disconnect my modem and go offline because my Pine
screen actually freezes.

The flashing error message reads: "EXON/EXOFF CHAR RECEIVED
SEE PRESERVE START-STOP FEATURE IN SETUP/CONFIG".

Well, I went to "Setup/Config" from the Main Menu and located
this particular item. I tried both options: first an "X" for
On and then an "X" for off, rebooting in between. But,
nothing changed. The flashing message starts and just keeps
going every time I press "Y" for print.

As for my printer setup, I use the first of the three
options: "Printer attached to IBM PC...known to work with
Kermit...." This seems the most suitable for me, since my
computer is an IBM compatible PC, and I use Kermit when
attaching to Pine.

Can anybody help me on this problem? Is my printer setup the
culprit? Has anyone else experienced this problem?

Thanks, Aaron

I use x (expunge). Besides removing the mails marked "D" it also
lokks for new arrived mails. It always work, even if there are no mail

We need some help with PC-Pine 3.89, which we have installed on our PCs
(with FTP INC. PC-TCP).
We are already using Pine 3.89 on Unix and have an impad server on one of
the Suns, which we manage to access from the other workstations.
Our problems is the setting of the varialbe TZ (Time Zone).
In our first installation (some months ago) we set TZ=MET+DST but with 
this value Pine was not able to read mails because insted of write "MET" 
in mail headers it wrote "+DS". 
So we tried the new setting: TZ=   MET+DST (with tree blanks) and we 
have had not more problems. Unfortunately, some days ago, some our 
users were not again able to read their mails because in their mail headers 
in place of the string "MET" there were tree blanks. So we had to change 
TZ value in the original ones: TZ=MET+DST (without blanks).
At the moment we have some users that need to use TZ=   MET+DST and others
that need to use ZT=MET+DST.
Do you now something about this? 
We noted that the users who needed to chance TZ (from "   MET+DST" to
"MET+DST") had folders very big, about 400-500 Kbyte.
Thanks.

I have just several suggestions for pine improvement:

1. Option for invoking sendmail in verbose mode (like mail -v)
  I know the problems with various MTA, but this should be only for sendmail
  (in config option like verbose-mode-of-sendmail enable ?)
  In ^X (send message) would then be (after enabling of this option in 
  config) an query "send in verbose mode" - default NO
  
2. I read the news through very slow link to remote news server and I noticed
that after opening newsgroup the headers of news messages are displayed
very slowly one after another. After display of one page is the process
  again slow. But when I give several SPC (new page) keystrokes in
keyboard buffer, all headers are (after while) read into pine -- some
header cache I suppose. Then I can free and fast move between all headers
( I have tried more than 800 headers will fit into the cache). So the
suggestion is to read all news headers at once (by some special command -
like "batch read of news ? /default NO) - the number of messages read
could be limited by some config-option. BTW. why is the reading of news
headers so slow in opposite of each article, which take seconds for several
KB (the amount of transfered text is comparable) ? 

3. Some threaded - like option for news would be highly appreciated
 (I hope not just by me) I understand the sort by ordered subject command,
but I mean to hide the Re: to same subject and display only an number of 
Re:   - something like trn  

I apologize for bothering the pine staff by such silly wishes, but maybe
some could be usable for others too.

If you could get down off your hind legs for a minute, you might see
that the person whose private email was posted was not the person who
answered the prompt with a yes--but rather an entirely innocent person.

Since you missed it the first time, I'll try again with an example: You

asking what owners of Acme think. I own an Acme and don't like it at all. 
Rather than post a reply and get flamed for not liking Acmes, I email you 
with my impressions from my newsreader. You get the email and read it in
Pine. You have some followup questions. In emailing me, you don't read
the second prompt and the message is posted to the group as well as mailed. 
Not my fault, is it?

I wish you had shown us all by example, in reading my first message, 
how "some thought" can prevent us from going off on the wrong tack.

I don't think Pine should be regarded as something brought down from the
Mount on stone tablets--at least not in its present form.

It's just silly to blame poor software design on "lazy" users.

If you could get down off your hind legs for a minute, you might see
that the person whose private email was posted was not the person who
answered the prompt with a yes--but rather an entirely innocent person.

Since you missed it the first time, I'll try again with an example: You
are thinking of buying an Acme computer and you post to comp.comp.acme,
asking what owners of Acme think. I own an Acme and don't like it at all.

Hi,

I'm looking for a Bourne or Awk Script which lists the entries of
folders created with Pine in the following manner:


Folder_name_1:
  1) "Subject"             "Date"
  2)   .                    .
  3)   .                    .

Folder_name_2:
  1) "Subject"             "Date"
  2)   .                    .
  3)   .                    .

Any ideas? Thanks a lot

Bye

So, is there any hope of being able to take advantage of whichever
situation you are in?  Could an IMAP server that had a high-speed
connection to your $HOME directory (perhaps on the same machine)
manipulate the transfer directly between your inbox and other
folders under your $HOME when you are connected remotely via a low
speed link (i.e don't traverse the user's link for this)?  Then
you could access them directly when you are connected locally or
via NFS over a high speed link.  What about the same concept for
manipulating a user's .newsrc in a single location for people who
bounce between connections/machines reading sometimes via nntp and
sometimes logged into the news host?

Both elm and tin add a line containing two dashes in front of the
signature. Pine doesn't. Why not? Isn't this some kind of standard?

Is it JUST me or  does PINE 3.91 seem to run noticably slower
since 3.89 (our last version)?
I've compile it using pretty much all the defaults, if not all of them.

I'm running it on an RS6000 w/ AIX.

Anyone?

	I have pine 3.91 and INN 1.4.  I have 2 machines - read 2 different
IP numbers.  I have on the 1st machine - my news server in my nnrp.access file
permissions for the 2nd machine to read news via nntp.  When I get into pine 
on the 2nd machine and run config and get to the point where I see this:
[ Select Here to See Expanded List ] and I press return, I get no list of
newsgroups but just the above message again.
	I have added the nntp-server value before I did the above.
	Anybody with any ideas about this?
	By the way, I am running Ultrix 4.2A on a Decstation 5000/133.
	Do I need the remote site on my news server declared in the 
/etc/hosts.equiv file?
	Thanks to all who respond.

	It may be the standard, but who wants a couple of dashes before
their signature? :) If you want them, then just add "-- " to the top of
your .signature file!

	There is no such standard.

	If you'd like, add the dashes to your signature file.

    Not just you...  I think it may have something to do with the way
    Pine is displaying the messages now.  There seems to be a longer
    delay.  Dunno.

Message-Id: <3a8qkf$5es@geraldo.cc.utexas.edu>

I just ftp-ed and installed PINE for VMS from tango.cchs.su.edu.au 
[.vms.pine]

The biggest reason I wanted to get PINE was for the MIME implementation.  
Well, it can receive and decode MIME fine, but will not allow for 
outgoing attatchments....ie: i cannot originate a MIME encoded mail. :/

Does anyone know if this particular version of PINE has been further 
developed?  Or am I going to have to go with the commercial version?

Thank you,

Subject: Bug producing multiple pines?
Date: 15 Nov 1994 00:24:02 GMT
Message-Id: <3a8v32$pe9@news.arc.nasa.gov>

We recently had a situation in which a user of pine got blown out of
a composition buffer; he saw but did not capture a bug number/message
and then did a ps, which showed 4 spare copies of pine running.   Eventually
the box he was on hung because there was not available memory to fork
new processes (this is on a Sparc running 4.1.3).

Has anyone seen anything like this before, or is there a known workaround
for this problem.

My thanks for any help you can give,
					Ted Hardie

You need a file named .forward in your home directory that looks something 
like this:

|/usr/local/bin/filter -q

And a file named .elm/filter-rules with rules like this:

if (from  fire-l@artopro.mlnet.com) then save ~/Mail/fire
if (from  rre-request@weber.ucsd.edu) then save ~/Mail/rre

The man pages for filter have some info in them and refer you to the Elm 
docs.

We have no schedule for Pine 3.92 at this time and do not see any pressing
bugs that would cause us to push for an early release.  We plan to take our
time and do some much needed performance tuning for 3.92...

Why not just edit your .pinerc file and select a new one for the 
signature.  Then copy your .signature file to the new file and add a "--" 
to the top?

This makes sense.  The next version of Pine will allow empty nickname 
fields and fullname fields to be entered and will allow them to be used 
for composing from the addrbook screen or with ^T in the composer.  
Thanks for the suggestion.

One of our users is getting the following message every time he
exits pine (3.90, BSDI 1.1):

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
Abort trap (core dumped)

The interesting part is, when I move his mail drop to a folder, e.g.
'mail-file', and invoke pine as pine -f mail-file, this error does not
occur.

Does anyone know what is going on here?

Hi,
	There's an option I would appreciate to be added to pine, multiple
news servers. Quite frequently, specific news groups are located on servers,
unavailable on standard campus news databases. If multiple folders, referring
to multiple news locations were available, this could have solved the 
problem.

Subject: How to change the NAME in Pine?
Message-Id: <CzB9vq.K7v@uwindsor.ca>
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 13:38:14 GMT


I am currently using Pine 3.89 on a SGI Irix machine.  I am just an
end user so I have no control over compiling anything, or setting up
new programs of any sort (well for the most part anyway...)

Now, my question is.   In my .tcshrc i have changed my $NAME variable
so that it prints out the short form of my name on outgoing mail and
such.  However, this only works on elm, and not on pine.  Pine still
uses the standard way that my account was registered under.  I just
want to now if it is possible to change this in pine and how?  I do
not have any configuration option available to me in pine directly, so
I am confused.   Maybe it is something in .pinerc?  I dunno.  Can some
please help?

Thanks.


Also, one other question.  Is it possible to set PICO to use more than
24 screen lines?  My display is 48 and it looks really cheesy...
Thanks.

Hello all!  Sorry to be so confused but:
When I send mail using Pine, it sets my return address incorrectly - it 
sets it to my login followed by the domain name, rather than the full 
machine address.  That is, what I get is: johnson@wcu.edu.  What I WANT 
is: johnson@micronet.wcu.edu

Now, when I use the mailx that came with my Solaris 2.3, mailx translates 
that beast into: johnson@micronet - I think if it's sending within the 
same domain (hopefully adding the domain to addresses OUTSIDE of this 
domain).  

How do I change how pine sets the from and/or return address?  I've 
looked at the settings but nothing seems to make a difference.

PC-Pine 3.89 had known problems with timezone handling.  Please upgrade 
to PC-Pine 3.91

I don't understand what TZ=MET+DST is supposed to mean.  Shouldn't it be 
TZ=MET-1DST instead?

Just wondering - I've followed directions on how to read news of another 
machine.  But, after setting the nntp server in my own config, quitting 
pine, then re-entering, I try to Add folders to my news area in the 
folder LIST - and get the following error message:

421 SMTP connection went away!

I don't have an smtp server set in the config file.  Do I need it? I 
understand that if I don't have it set, the std unix sendmail will be used.

I am getting the following error when attempting to view a mime

I do not get this error on normal mail, but mime mail packed by CMU mpack
utility gets this whether I manually send it or I let mpack send the mail. 

The attachment appears to be OK, and can be saved, but I was wondering if 
this is something wrong with the message format that is easy to fix (in 
which case I would like to fix it).

Basicly, when I start pc-pine up says that its opening my

Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong?

Hi,
	I'm not sure this option is available in pine (ver. 3.91), but
if it does exist, please tell me how.

	I would like to be able to keep more than one news server. On the
one hand, there's our local server, which holds most usersgroups. On the
other hand, there're specialized groups, which are available on foreign
servers. Is there a way to keep both worlds on my pine?

				Ran

This probably means you have an /etc/mailcap file which defines an entry 
which uses the "hd" command, but your systems doesn't have hd installed.

Is there a simple way to correct this?

Will the next release of the Windows version coincide with this as 
yet unscheduled release of Pine 3.92?  I'm very curious as to how the 
work is going on this program.

I tried to compile pine3.91 on Solaris 5.1 by type 'build sol' and using

Pine, I had the following error message:

Is it because of our system or something wrong with the codes in the pine

Is there any way to disable the printing of folder lists?
Someone at our site printed a list of all the newsgroups -
twice.  Now I'm sitting here with about, oh, 350 sheets of
paper sitting in my lap and find this to be a bit of a
waste of both paper and toner.

Also, printing to attached-to-ansi doesn't work at our site.
Everything is printed to the screen instead.  Has anyone
else had this problem?

I stripped my copy to make it about 1/5 the size and it seems to be
running fine.

     strip pine.binary (or whatever)

    Thanks for the tip John, but it does not help, at least in my
    case.  As an example try opening the INBOX, going to the log
    list, selecting a log, delete a message in the log, and then go
    back to the INBOX.  The messages that tell you that it is closing
    a log, how many its deleteing, how many its keeping, and opening
    INBOX, et al, take forever to display.  I am just used to the way
    3.89 just slapped the messages up there.  I miss it...  I realize
    that this may be going towards the user-friendly, dork proofness
    philosophy of pine, and it is not a bitch, just an observation.

    As another example, startup two pine sessions, let the second
    grab the read-write lock from the first instance, and quit the
    first one.  Notice how quickly it exits since it does not have to
    tell the user that it is closing the INBOX.  Yes, I realize that
    it also does not have to flush the INBOX changes, but this
    happens even after an eXpunge...

    As a suggestion to the Pine team, how about a:

    i-dont-care-about-the-messages switch, or a
    message-display-interval variable?

    If I really need to find out what message was just on my screen,
    I can goto the $HOME/.pine-debugX files.

    Dont you just love how nit-picky users (of free software...) can
    get?

I was curious about that.  I guess it's a standard specific to usenet.
Nevertheless it's a common practice even among mailers.

And I just installed Pine 3.91, and it is almost an order of magnitude slower
initializing than 3.90.  This is a real problem that is preventing me from 
allowing production use.  The system is Dynix 3 on a Sequent Symetry and using
time for both 3.90 and 3.91 with an inbox size of ~160 messages:
	2x+	real
	~10x	user
	~1.5x	system
	
Any hints GREATLY apprciated.

Now we are getting to the root of the problem.  What you are saying is 
that the email message you recieved had a header

	Newsgroups: comp.comp.acme

in it.  Pine's interpretation of that header is that the message was posted
to the newsgroup.  This interpretation conforms to all RFC specifications of
the Newsgroups: header than I am aware of.  In any case, the default for the
prompt you are so strenuously objecting to is NO, so a user would have to
press 'Y' to post the reply to the group.  Anyone in the habit of blindly
hitting 'Y' at every prompt is bound to get some unexpected results. 

For more discussion of the Newsgroups: header, see the flamewar that has been
raging in comp.mail.headers for the last month or so.  Please do not restart
it here, thanks.

I can't reproduce the problem on our S81 running Dynix 3.2.0.  I
tested times to open a big (1826 message) mailfile:

3.91:                20.2 real        12.8 user         4.0 sys  
3.90:                25.1 real        13.4 user         4.0 sys  
/usr/ucb/Mail:       38.6 real        32.0 user         3.0 sys  

So here at least 3.91 starts up faster than 3.90, and both are much
faster than the stock mailer.

Thanks to the people who emailed me. This is apparently a known bug
in pine 3.90. I have upgraded to 3.91 and all is now well.

Subject: Looking for mail and news experts for Internet Secrets book
Message-Id: <1994Nov16.064207.16172@chico.iecc.com>
Date: Wed, 16 Nov 1994 06:42:07 GMT

I'm putting together the upcoming "Internet Secrets" to be published
by IDG Books.  Secrets books are compilations of tips and tricks from
expert users, and I'm looking for some people who are interesting in
contributing to the book.  All contributions are credited (unless for
some reason you want to be anonymous) and you get a copy of the book
when it comes out (it's a $49.95 book, don't laugh).  For substantial
chunks, like a full chapter, we can offer modest amounts of actual
money.

In particular, we're looking for people to give an inside look at the
"top ten" (for some value of ten) network applications, particularly:

* Unix mailers: elm, pine, mh, xmh
* Windows mailers: Eudora, Pegasus
* Bending sendmail and smail to your will (yes, I now it's possible to
	write entire books about sendmail)
* Unix news: trn, tin, nn
* Windows news: trumpet, winvn

(If your favorite program doesn't appear on that list and you think that
it should, drop me a note.  Of course, I'll ask you to write about it.)

For each program, we're looking for stuff that's not obvious from the man
page, what you need to do to make them sing and dance, particular ways to
set up or use them to do things that one might not have through possible.

Material need not be 100% new; in many cases an adaptation of an existing
FAQ would be great.  Even though FAQs tend to change every month, for many
readers a printed version of a FAQ is still very useful since A) you can
get it before you have net access and B) you can read it in the bathroom.
We'd want a pointer to the on-line FAQ, of course, so people can get the
latest versions.

If interested, drop me a line at contrib@dummies.com.

Date: 16 Nov 1994 17:16:41 GMT
Message-Id: <3adepp$idf@news.nevada.edu>

Please tell me, (in easy to understand terms ;-)) what to do:

I have tried, in vain, to make the procmail work with Pine.  I currently 
have Pine 3.89, but will probably upgrade to 3.91 next week.

When I thought I had done everything correctly and tried to open the 
newly created incoming folders, It said: 'opening folder x...'  'cannot 
open folder x...'  'no such file or directory...'

I only need the procmail to separate my incoming mail to several 
folders.  Should be a simple task...

What changes do I need to make in my .pinerc?
How to set up .procmailrc correctly?
What else should I do to get it to work?
By the way, I need to separate mail based on TO and/or CC lines, not the 
FROM line.

I have spent hours on this.  Please help so I can stop pulling my hair...

Here's a bit of .procmailrc that works for me:

     PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail      #you'd better make sure it exists
     DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/mbox
     LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/from

     * ^Cc:.*imap
     Saved-Imap-Messages
     :0:
     * ^To:.*imap
     Saved-Imap-Messages

Any mail with "imap" in the To: or Cc: lines gets filed in the folder 
Saved-Imap-Messages and it shows up in the folder listing when I type 
"L".  This should work with 3.89 and 3.91 just fine!

Setting editor= in the pine.conf and/or .pinerc does not do it.

What does?

Hi,

First things first....  I'm using PINE v3.87

Is there a way to send a message from the command line, with no need for 
interaction from the user at all?  Ie: In ELM, you can....

elm -s "subject" "address" < .messagetext

Is there a way to do this in PINE?  Do I need the newest version?

Thanks.

There is the c-client library that comes with the Pine distribution which 
does stuff to do with mail reading in various mail box formats and can 
also handle remote mail boxes through IMAP and possibly POP 3 (but I'm 
not sure about the POP bit).  It should be easy to turn into a perl5 
extension (he said glibly having not even glanced over the code 'cos Pine 
works out of the box :-)... then using Curses or Tk or whatever a perl 
mailreader would be do-able.  The honourable thing to do here would be to 
volunteer to look at it, but various personal things & the looming 
festive season mean I'd be even slower to get to it than usual.

Anyway I've cross-posted to comp.mail.pine in case one of the developers 
feels like illuminating the c-client library.

Printing attached-to-ansi depends on the terminal program.
They all work differently. I used RIPTERM which also only prints to the 
screen. TELIX will print to a printer.
That is of course if you use a dial-up-link and DOS programs.

That message is a catch-all that happens with both SMTP and NNTP 
connections (the same routine is used).

It means that in sending a command (in either protocol) or reading the
response, the TCP connection closed unexpectedly. 

Does your NNTP server require login/password?

I am looking at this problem now.  Dennis' message to pine-bugs contained 
extra information which is very helpful.

I have a hunch of the cause, which could also very well explain why some
people see it and others do not. If this hunch is correct, it's a C
library bug.  But in order to give you a fix, I need to know the answers
to these questions: 

What is the difference between a Sequent Symetry and an S81, and what is 
the difference between Dynix 3 and Dynix 3.2.0?

Are these systems the BSD-like system formerly known as Dynix, or the 
SVR4-like system that is also known as PTX?

Which Pine port are you using (DYN or PTX)?

Dennis, if I gave you a patch, would you be able to build a new version 
and try it out?

Finally, has anyone else seen a slowdown between Pine 3.90 and Pine 3.91
in opening standard UNIX folders, and if so, what is the machine type,
operating system, and Pine port?  I am *NOT* interested in performance
reports between Pine 3.89 and Pine 3.91; there are other known problems
which are under investigation.  I am narrowing my focus to this particular
problem.

If you are root, then put that list inside the aliases file. otherwise, 
make the .forward file in one account and put all those name, and mail to 
that account.

Anyone with better idea?

I want jove, which is set as my $EDITOR, so I have the following lines in
~/.pinerc:


# List of features; see Pine's Setup/options menu for the current set.
# e.g. feature-list= select-without-confirm, signature-at-bottom
# Default condition for all of the features is no-.
feature-list=old-growth,
        signature-at-bottom,
        enable-alternate-editor-implicitly


I then have:

editor=$EDITOR

in the ~/.pinerc, in case I change my mind to use JED or emacs or joe.

Whenever I page down from the headers it autoloads the editor.  NEAT!

IMHO, this is the biggest shortcoming of pine.  Someone needs to write a
shell script or perl program that will use the pine addressbook and apend
the sent message to the sent-mail folder.

You need only one recipe to match the condition "To:" and "Cc:", it looks

My new Pine 3.91 is wonderful, mostly.  But I am encountering what I 
think may be a bug.  When I have selected the News option and read 
through several items in various news folders, and then returned to the 
INBOX, I then have a problem when I attempt to send a composed file.  
When prompted to save to sent-mail, I type Y (yes).  PINE sends me a 
message of an error 411, unable to open folder or rather it doesn't exist.

If I quit PINE and reopen it and stay in the mail side of the option, the 
problem disappears and I get on with the work, but moving from Mail to 
News and back to Mail seems to generate a problem.

I hope you're wearing asbestos attire.  Elm and pine are "mail user agents".  Sendmail, smail, et. al. are mta's

Getting the latest version, 3.91, would be a good idea.  But you still
can't do "pine someone <file" in 3.91.

It looks like pine effectively does a isatty(0) on startup, so if
you're really determined you probably could get around the input
redirection restriction by running pine under a program like pty or
expect.

Hi,
	For some reason, my pc-pine (ver. 3.91) doesn't allow me sending 
messages.
	Here's my configuration:


user-id                  = chermesh
user-domain              = bgumail.bgu.ac.il
smtp-server              = bgumail.bgu.ac.il
nntp-server              = cc-news.technion.ac.il
inbox-path               = {bgumail.bgu.ac.il}inbox
folder-collections       = {bgumail.bgu.ac.il}mail/[]
news-collections         = <No value set: Using *{cc-news.technion.ac.il/nn...
default-fcc              = {bgumail.bgu.ac.il}~chermesh/mail/sent_mail
postponed-folder         = {bgumail.bgu.ac.il}~chermesh/mail/postponed-msgs
read-message-folder      = <No Value Set>
signature-file           = c:\trumpet\sig
global-address-book      = <No Value Set>
address-book             = <No Value Set: using addrbook>


	Whenever I try sending a message, the response I get is:

Folder "{bgumail...sent_mail" doesn't exist. Create?

	If I say, yes, the response I get is:

[Can't connect to 132.72.141.2,143: Refused (61)]
Can't access server

	If I cancell my 'fcc:' specification, the response I get is:

Error connecting to mail server.

	The strange thing is that I can READ messages, which means that I
manage to establish connection with this server.

	What's wrong? Can the problem stem from incompatibilites between
my pinepc *ver. 3.91) and my host's unix pine (ver. 3.90)?

Hi:
I use PINE 3.91.
To use the UNIX 'vi' editor instead of PINE's default 'pico' editor, 
I
	1) change the editor line in PINE's configuration file to
	   editor     =vi
	   The PINE configuration file is available under PINE's 
	   main menu,
	2) hit the ^_ key (i.e. Control-Underline) which is only
	   available from WITHIN the body of the message.
Hope this helps.
Byrg

Well, I've run 3.89 remotely using Telemate and it printed, and used it in
the lab via an xterm with it printing correctly.  PINE 3.91, however, no
longer prints the same through the xterm and I haven't tested it with
telemate yet, but I've had a report of it not printing correctly over the
modem. 

I asked once before but the only response I got was "We didn't change the
printing code."  So I'm at a complete loss...

To copy a text file into an e-mail message, using PINE, simply use 
control-R to "read file" into the message. It works for me. 

Has this already been answered before, and I missed the answer?

I am using TinyTERM by Century Software (Ver2.0.0) with excellent results 
on attached-to-ansi printing.   This product works with just about every 
printer and has very good terminal emulations.   I am using it with pine 
3.90 from my Internet provider which is running on a Sun.    I use it 
from work and home on my PCs to talk to my Internet provider and my 
AcerAltos SCO Unix system at work.

Has anyone ported PINE to a AcerAltos 7000 box?   We are running 
AcerAltos's Version of SCO Unix 3.2 v4.2aCO.  I will be starting 
to port it sometime during the month of December 1994 and was looking 
for some advice.    Any help/problems/ideas/tips would be greatly 
appreciated.  I will be reporting back my progress.  

Thanks,   _---_

No we're not. The problem is that the way pine is now configured,
the PRIVATE email of an innocent person can be inadvertently posted
publicly by someone else. That's the problem--not whether or not 
Pine passed RFC muster.

So, I eat in a restaurant. I get food poisoning. I complain to
the manager and he tells me the food was all inspected. Great!

The user just pressed a "Y" in the immediately preceeding step.
You make it sound like he has to go out of his way to press "Y".
This is misleading.

Why not make the posting default changeable? Ms. Nancy McGough
may have pointed the way on how to do this early in the thread.
If there is some reason why it *can't* be done, fine. But to deny
that there is a problem is wrongheaded.

You fellows seem to feel some sense of poetic justice is being
served here. That is simply not the case and suggests that you
do not yet understand what is happening: that the private email
that gets posted is *not* that of the person hitting the wrong
key. This is the key point and one that you--and especially Mr.
Kooijman--seem to have missed.

Anyone can replicate the problem by using a test group, BTW. 
No need to take my word for it.

I will try to explain the scenario more clearly:

You are thinking of buying an Acme computer and you post to 
comp.comp.acme, asking what owners of Acme think. I own an Acme and
don't like it at all. Rather than post a reply and get flamed for not
liking Acmes, I email you with my impressions from my newsreader. You
get the email and read it in Pine. You have some followup questions.
You hit "r" for reply. Then you hit "y" to include MY PRIVATE EMAIL 
message in your reply. So far, so good. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
But now the second prompt, about also posting, comes--and you goof.
With your finger still on the "Y" key, you hit "Y" just like on the
last, so familiar, prompt. This will cause your reply *and my 
incorporated private email* to be publicly posted! You write down your
comments and questions and send it. Since you didn't handle the second 
prompt properly, MY PRIVATE EMAIL, AS PART OF YOUR ALSO POSTED REPLY,
IS NOW POSTED TO A PUBLIC NEWSGROUP THROUGH NO FAULT OF MY OWN.

It's dangerous. It stinks. And it's already happening.

Ironically, Pine is touted as the choice for novice users.

This would have been more credibly directed toward Mr. Kooijman
earlier in the thread, Mr. Miller.

Subject: 0.0 About this Article

Q: How can I have my incoming mail messages automatically put into an 
   appropriate folder?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This article 
is the first release of an FAQ that addresses this question.  This version 
gives basic instructions for how to set up either procmail or Elm's filter 
to filter mailing lists.  Future versions of this FAQ will include 
instructions for doing other things like automatically replying to certain 
messages.

If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the Elm and filter developers
recommend procmail over filter.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key 
  and g key pressed together) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------

a                                 Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/mail/faq.split   Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a file named

Subject: 1.0 Naming Your Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with ``IN''.
For example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a
folder named IN.procmail.  I do this so that when all my folders
are listed alphabetically the incoming folders are together and
near the top.  They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive
and upper case letters come before lower case letters in an ascii
sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders.

Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up procmail to
filter incoming mailing list messages.

To find out how to process existing mail folders see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:02:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 2.1 Setting Up Procmail

1] Find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using csh type:

     which procmail

   Or if you are using sh or ksh type:

     type procmail

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``whereis'' and
   ``where''.  If your system doesn't have procmail ask your system 
   administrator to install it.  If your sys admin isn't able to do this,
   use a different mail processor like deliver, mailagent, or filter 
   (described in part 2 of this FAQ).


2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

  
2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace ``mail'' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd
     cd .procmail
     pico rc.test


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.test:

      :0:
      * ^Subject: .*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in the subject "Explanation of Test Recipe" below.


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace ``nancym'' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file: If 
      procmail resides below your home directory write out the *full* path.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
    ``test'' in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were
    delivered correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can determine what
      the problem is.  

    * Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.test

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.procmailrc so
      that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  If you are still having problems see the 
      subject "Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail" below.

   
8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.folders for filtering incoming messages into mail folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.folders


8b] Enter a modified version of the following in ~/.procmail/rc.folders

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second recipe
     filters the procmail mailing lists  The meaning of the first recipe is 
     as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^           Match the beginning of a line followed by....
        TO         ``To: '' ``Cc: '' or other synonyms for To, followed by any
                     characters followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     Create a recipe for each of your mailing lists.  Make sure that you
     use ``^TO'' with no space between the carat (^) and the word ``TO'', 
     and that both letters are capitalized -- if you don't it won't work.

     Note that ^TO is not a normal regular expression.  It is a special
     procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination 
     specification.  See the MISCELLANEOUS section of the procmailrc(5)
     man page for details.  For examples, see procmailex(5) man page.
     

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.test line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

     Note that it's useful to leave the rc.test line there for future testing.

Subject: ... 2.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

There is a useful script, which is part of the procmail package, for 
checking your procmail log file called mailstat.  Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either ``which mailstat'' or ``type mailstat''.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  It is located with all the other procmail tools at:

Subject: ... 2.4 Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

Some systems do not need a .forward file (i.e., having a .procmailrc file 
suffices if procmail already is the local delivery agent).

Subject: 3.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:03:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.1 Setting up Filter

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"


     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

the *newest* version of pine allows you to read netnews...

personally, I feel that the two are different enough that it's
worth it to keep a distinction between mail and netnews.

To someone with the know how

   I have set up pine to read my mail on a UNIX account
on a PC from home. Here's the problem:

Pine uses IMAP UNIX port 143 to read mail. My sUNIX server
does not surport port 143. It uses ports 25 SMTP , 109 pop2
& 110 pop3. 

Question? Is there a way to set up pine on either of these
ports 25, 109, 110 so that I can use PC-pine from home.
I know some would say just setup aIMAP on the UNIX server
but that is not an option I wanted to take.


Any help will be most aperciated, and remember that PC-PINE
I need to set the port for.

				Thankx N advance

Hi!
	I've had some problems with screen junk, and found that it was the
software; not all packages that say they are emulating vt-100 actually do.
I switched to Procomm Plus v2.01 and now have no more problems. 
	Hope this was of some help! (Since I was using a well-known 
communications software previously).

Kirk,
  The short answer is "no".  PCPine needs an IMAP server and can't use a 
POP or SMTP server for reading mail, though it does use SMTP for sending 
mail.  Also, the important thing is the protocol, not the port number.  
It's possible to set up a POP server on port 143 but it cause all sorts 
of havoc because programs connecting to port 143 would expect the IMAP 
protocol, not the POP protocol.

1. It's two dashes AND a space at the beginning of the line : "-- "
2. It is a standard.  A number of news and mail UAs recognise it as
   meaning 'The rest of the message is a .sig' and allow the user to
   ignore it by default if they wish.

What you have just told us is that IMAP is not supported on your UNIX
server.  Why are you trying to use it?  It has to be installed and
configured, it is not standard UNIX.

At least it does not offer the novice the choice of editing her spool file
with vi, as elm does, which results in a number of corrupted mail spool
files each week at our site.

There would be no need to carry on about this if the team would admit that
there is more than one cognitive map of how news and mail work.  They also
want to insist that there is no modality between news and mail usage.

The failure to make this configurable befouls an otherwise excellent product
(except the the Bcc problem).

Standing firm, side by side by side.

Neither is correct.
You can post via email by sending it via a mail->news gateway.
This should not depend on the mailer you use.

It's a FAQ.  :-)
See the ELM FAQ:
2.19    Can I use elm for posting and replying to news?

I wrote in a followup to "How to post news through pine or elm?":
>Well, ELM is an mail transport agent - not a newsreader.

setzerkl@vuse.vanderbilt.edu (a very mysterious person) corrects me:
>I hope you're wearing asbestos attire.  Elm and pine are "mail user agents".
>Sendmail, smail, et. al. are mta's

Indeed!  ELM is a "Mail _User_ Agent" - not a "Mail Transport Agent".
Thanks for the correction!

Let me get this straight.

You use a news reader that sends mail, and in that mail it implies that 
the message was posted to a newsgroup.

The recipient of your email message sees that it appears to have been 
posted to a newsgroup as well, and he decides to post his reply to that 
newsgroup too.

Your contend that it is the recipient's fault (or the fault of the
recipient's software) that he made that assumption, and not your fault (or
your mail sending software) for implying that in the first place. 

We disagree.

It would be better to fix the mail composer which makes such false
implications.

Subject: 0.0 About this Article

Q: How can I have my incoming mail messages automatically put into an 
   appropriate folder?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This article 
is the first release of an FAQ that addresses this question.  This version 
gives basic instructions for how to set up either procmail or Elm's filter 
to filter incoming mailing list messages.  Future versions of this FAQ will 
include instructions for doing other things like automatically replying to 
certain messages.

If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the Elm and filter developers
recommend procmail over filter.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
 Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key 
  and g key pressed together) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------
|                                 Pipe
a                                 Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/mail/faq.split   Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a file named
                                  ~/mail/faq.split.  (Replace ~/mail
                                  with your folder directory.)
pine -if faq.split                Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

For more information see the formail(1) man pages.

Subject: 1.0 Naming Your Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with ``IN''.
For example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a
folder named IN.procmail.  I do this so that when all my folders
are listed alphabetically the incoming folders are together and
near the top.  They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive
and upper case letters come before lower case letters in an ascii
sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up procmail to
filter incoming mailing list messages.

To find out how to process existing mail folders see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:02:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 2.1 Setting Up Procmail

1] Find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using csh type:

     which procmail

   Or if you are using sh or ksh type:

     type procmail

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``whereis'' and
   ``where''.  If your system doesn't have procmail ask your system 
   administrator to install it.  If your sys admin isn't able to do this,
   use a different mail processor like deliver, mailagent, or filter 
   (described in part 2 of this FAQ).


2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

  
2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace ``mail'' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd
     cd .procmail
     pico rc.test


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.test:

      :0:
      * ^Subject: .*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in the subject "Explanation of Test Recipe" below.


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace ``nancym'' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file: If 
      procmail resides below your home directory write out the *full* path.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
    ``test'' in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were
    delivered correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can determine what
      the problem is.  

    * Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.test

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.procmailrc so
      that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  If you are still having problems see the 
      subject "Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail" below.

   
8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.folders for filtering incoming messages into mail folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.folders


8b] Enter a modified version of the following in ~/.procmail/rc.folders

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second recipe
     filters the procmail mailing lists  The meaning of the first recipe is 
     as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     Create a recipe for each of your mailing lists.  Make sure that you
     use ``^TO'' with no space between the caret (^) and the word ``TO'', 
     and that both letters are capitalized -- if you don't it won't work.

     Note that ^TO is not a normal regular expression.  It is a special
     procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination 
     specification.  See the MISCELLANEOUS section of the procmailrc(5)
     man page for details.  For examples, see procmailex(5) man page.
     

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.test line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

     Note that it's useful to leave the rc.test line there for future testing.

Subject: ... 2.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

There is a useful script, which is part of the procmail package, for 
checking your procmail log file called mailstat.  Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either ``which mailstat'' or ``type mailstat''.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  It is located with all the other procmail tools at:

Subject: ... 2.4 Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

Some systems do not need a .forward file (i.e., having a .procmailrc file 
suffices if procmail already is the local delivery agent).

Subject: 3.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:03:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject: ... 3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

Hmm, Is this just me or...

Has anyone noticed that if you Postpone a msg, then do something else (in Pine),
press Compose, answer Yes to finish Postponed msg, finish the mail and then Send
it with ^X Pine will bug out and no msg will be sent?

We are running SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.3 with v3.91 of Pine and the problem
appears on both systems.

Anyone????

Why don't you just read news with tin if you've got such a problem with 
the way pine handles this, and put lines in your system-wide 
pine.conf.fixed file disabling news-reading or posting from within pine?

I'm sorry, but it does not. In the scenario, I am replying to a 
public posting via private email only. The message I send is not
posted to the newsgroup and there is no implication that it was.

No, this is not so. But Pine will go on to act as though it were.

Whether he decides to or not, unless he exercises meticulous care,
he will, publicly posting as well my private email to him (by virtue
of it's being naturally included in his "reply"). This was never a
problem in version 3.89. It's a new feature.

I use nn as my news reader.  IF a MUA allows redirected input, then nn can
be configured to use that MUA.  I cannot do this with pine because pine does
not accept redirected input.  I will mail this to myself when I post it to
see what the default behavior of nn is without doing that.  The problem is
that there are a lot of broken newsreaders out there.  pine should assume
worst possible case scenario.

For some strange reason, I think my users will prefer using pine for news.
I will not use pine for news because I have to explicitly delete each
message I do not want to see again.  That would add several hours to the 2
or 3 I spend every day just keeping up with several groups.
Tin is too clunky for me, although lots of my users prefer it.  I use nn,
which is the best and fastest way to keep up with a large volume of news.  I
do not read threads, just selected authors who I trust.  Whatever I page
past on the subject menus disappears forever.

Besides I am not sure how to do what you are talking about.  I do not think
I have news enabled on pine, and I still get the "offer" to post private
email back to the group from which it came.

You could load a print capture program before loading your comm program. 
Then when you print the message it ends up in a file. 
However, everything which you send to the printer will go into the file.

It still amazes me how easily Pine installs on my system.  Unlike most of
the GNU software, which has countless switches and installation troubles,
Pine installs without further input after entering the correct build command.
The GNU developers should tailor their products to install just as easily.

How about using E to export the mail message to a file then using some 
form of file transfer FTP or kermit should both be avialable to you.

use PC-Pine. It will then allow you to save mail from your INBOX on the 
remote UNIX system to a local mailbox on your c: drive.

I have got procmail to work fine, no problems.  But I have noticed
some people are using  :0:  in their rc files, versus  :0.

Whats the difference?

One response said that you could use PINE to do this, another indicated 
neither PINE nor ELM could be thus used - which is correct?

Isn't there some standard internet addressing format that enables one to 
send a post to a conference and, if so, what is it? Isn't there such a 
convention to use to post to mailing lists to which one is not a regular 
subscriber ("listserve@UKCC.uky.edu" for example)?

Hi Netters,

just wondering, is there a switch in pine that will cause it to delete a

thanks in advance for your help :)

Subject: Help! Braodcast address change and other probs

First problem:  Using Telnet and can't seem to get the delete key to work.

2)  In Pine, ^C is not responding, other keys are

3)  I would like to broadcast an address change to my address book.  Is 
this possible?

4)  Or, if I include my three seperate lists in bcc, can I tell Pine to 
delete duplicates?

5)  Somehow Pine crashed after I had been working on problems 3 and 4 and 
all my work (an hours worth) of deleting duplicate addresses was lost.  
Sometimes Pine will save the message to be resumed later but not this 
time. Why?

Thanks for the help in advance, I am very frustrated!

May I add my thoughts...

If I reply, by PRIVATE e-mail, from anywhere, to anyone, the person who
receives this private e-mail should NOT have any "option" available to  
reply in a public forum. If the software he uses offers this (public)  
option it is wrong, and the software should be fixed.

If the software can't tell the difference between public and private
e-mail, it is wrong and should be fixed.

Fine, except it's the program that's *sending* the mail that is 
improperly marking it to indicate that it has been publicly 
posted. 

Actually - there has been an argument about this because the 
semantics of "Newsgroups:" has not been sufficiently specified
in the RFC's. But, if Newgroups: is NOT interpreted to mean
that the message was, in fact, meant to be publicly posted to
that newsgroup, then there is *IN FACT* no way for a program to
on the recieving end to distinguish between a private message
or a public post. 

It is the software that is putting "Newsgroups:" headers into
messages that are not meant to be publicly posted, and marking
them as public postings that is, IMHO broken, and should be fixed.

Hi all,
  I am using pine.3.90 for SCO Unix and found problem (not sure if its
  mine or not).
  Every now and then, someone will run pine and it will only let them
  have read access to their mailbox.  It says that the mailbox is locked
  by another process.  When they look at the process number, it belongs
  to another use, and they have to get the owner of that process to
  exit Pine.
  I'm not sure what to do about.  All suggestions are appreciated.
  Michael

Well, if the Wyse 30 is a magic cookie terminal as is the Wyse 50, it will take
a lot of modification to make pine/pico work correctly (if at all).  Since the
main application that we use (hotel reservation system) was written for the Wyse
50, I looked at making the changes necessary to support them; however, I have
really not had any time to do so.

If anyone has done this, I would certainly like to know.

I have noticed when connecting and reading mail from either discussion 
groups or binary groups that reading with "tin" is extremely slow as 
compared with "pine", and they both function the same way (or maybe 
not).  Anyone know why Pine v 3.91 is faster in pulling up USENET groups.

Thank you very much for agreeing with us.  The software which sent a private
message couldn't tell that it was private, and indicated in its headers that
it was a public message by writing a Newsgroups: line.  Therefore it is wrong
and should be fixed.

Certain people, however, are erroneously blaming Pine for believing a
declaration that a message was public, and therefore offering to make a public
reply.  The only sensible interpretation that one can make from this is that
there are people who work on Pine and answer bug reports, whereas nobody gives
a damn about fixing broken mail software that write bogus Newsgroups: lines.

Personally, I would rather that worked-on software does the right thing, and
that broken old software be allowed, nay *encouraged*, to go extinct.

Sometimes, broken old designs (especially when those broken designs are *NOT*

Sure there is.  One very simple way:

     Did the message come from the NNTP server?
     Or did it come from the mail spool?

If Pine pulled the message from the NNTP server, it's appropriate to ask
"Do you want to post a reply to the newsgroup?"  If Pine pulled the
message from the mail server, on the other hand, it has *NO BUSINESS*
posting a response to a public forum.  I don't care what the Newsgroups:
line says, if this message was in my mail spool then it's private.  End of
discussion. 

>It is the software that is putting "Newsgroups:" headers into

I respectfully disagree.  Software which can't remember the physical
source of a message and instead relies on (possibly bogus) header
information is, IMHO broken, and should be fixed. 

(Don't get me wrong.  Other than this Pine is an incredible program.  This
one flaw isn't enough to keep me from using it or recommending it to
others!)

Well...maybe we're starting to get somewhere now. First, there _was_
no problem--or, it served the sloppy user right. Now, we've moved on 
to blaming primitive and poorly tuned newsreaders.

If you people circling the wagons would care to recall, all I have 
been asking is to make the "Post also?" prompt able to be toggled off.

Pretty sad.

The 3.89 version of Pine did not exhibit this dangerous behavior using
the _same_ newsreaders. Seems like this part of 3.9x Pine was designed 
for use in a perfect world--not in our real world where novice users
might choose Tin for the same reason they would choose Pine.

Hard to see how Pine ever got to be as fine a package as it is (a few 
features notwithstanding) if everyone who criticizes it gets the same 
treatment I have gotten here: first, an uncaged Mr. Kooijman; then, a
rush to the battlements; and now, blaming everything else.

What? GNU software installs easiest of all freely available UNIXoid
software these days. My build goes like this:

 - unpack
 - move to the build dir
 - ./configure
 - make
 - make install

And that's about it.

A ':' at the end of the recipe flag line specifies that procmail
should use a lockfile during that recipe's processing.
Recipes with just :0 do not use a lockfile during recipe processing.
A 3rd form of the flag line is :0:lockfile which tells procmail
to use "lockfile" as the name of the lockfile.

Use of lockfiles is recommended for all recipes that result
in writing to a file such as the recipes like:
:0:
*^header: whatever
folder

I would say this differently.  Pine does not implicitly *believe* the
Newsgroups declaration, and since it doesn't know what is intended in these
cases, it gives the user the opportunity to "believe" the Newsgroups 
header or not. 

In fact, there are *three* different prompts --not just one-- where the user
can control what happens.  Two of those prompts specifically ask about
posting, and their default is NO. Unless the user explicitly answers Yes to
all 3 of those prompts, the message will not be posted.  (We naively 
thought that three prompts would be sufficient to prevent mistakes... :)

Some have suggested that news and mail are fundamentally different and should
be kept completely separate in Pine.  Whether or not this is desirable is
debatable, but the debate is moot because in practice there is no way to make
that distinction in a general-purpose message reader.  At a technical level,
there are not "mail folders" and "news folders", there are only "message
folders", comprised of messages which may or may not contain a Newsgroups
header. Since Pine doesn't control which messages have a Newsgroups header,
it can't reliably infer what to do with them in all cases.  It can only ask
the user what their intent is. 

Others have suggested that all Pine needs to do is remember whether a message
was delivered via nntp vs. smtp... but Pine usually does not know how
messages were originally delivered, it just reads folders created by other
processes or saved-message folders created by Pine --and *many* people like
to save messages by topic, not by transport mechanism, so saved message
folders on a particular topic will often contain a mixture of messages
delivered via different transport mechanisms --with and without Newsgroups
headers.  Once again, Pine can only *ask* what is intended in a Reply when
there is ambiguity. 

Note also that there is no effective difference between posting to a 
newsgroup and sending a message to an email list, so again any attempt
to protect users by treating news as totally different from mail is 
doomed to fail.  (This newsgroup is a good example, since it is 
bi-directionally gatewayed to an email list.  "Newsgroups: comp.mail.pine" 
is identical to "CC: pine-info@cac.washington.edu" in terms of exposure.)

Having said that, and while agreeing with Mark and others that it would be
better if those newsreaders that include the Newsgroups header in a *mail*
message stopped doing so (or used a different header), there is one thing we
can do in Pine to reduce the odds that someone will inadvertently post a msg
they didn't intend to: we can change the first of the three relevant prompts
(Post follow-up?) so that those who type "Y" reflexively (instead of the
safer "press RETURN" reflex) will not get into trouble.  Barry Cornelius in
the UK has sent us some good suggestions in this area.  One approach to a 
new prompt under consideration would also allow offering the choice of both
sending via mail *and* posting, which several folks have requested. 

This change in prompt behavior would introduce some additional modality in
the user interface, which is generally considered a Bad Thing in UI design
circles, but in this case is probably justified.

	Why do I get this sinking feeling that we are about to experience
another episode of "The squeaky wheel gets greased"?

	I've lived outside of the US for some time...yet there seems to
be several sayings that are "Universal".  Some of them are:

	"You can please some of the people all of the time.......but you
dan't please all of the people all of the time."

	"Never *assume*....because when you do...."

	"Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me."

	IMHO, the three prompts of pine are quite sufficient.  The addition
of new prompts only means that some people will have to "learn" more
prompts to blindly supply responses.  There is no way to make pine "fool
proof" as long as you have the fallible human behind the keyboad.

	I've read some people suggest that the default behaviour of pine
is likely to lead to embarrassment to the novice user.  In my experience
I've found that *not* to be the case.  Although not scientific, I recently
exposed a group of our cc:Mail users to pine.  I let them play with it
for a few days...and then I set up a senario similar to that being
discussed.  Not one of the novice users made the mistake of posting
a reply.  Part of the reason this was not a scientific study is that
English is a second language for my users, so they tend to read
all of the prompts.  But, that should tell you something too.

	I, for one, would not appreciate yet another change in the
keystrokes of pine simply to appease what I feel is a minority of
users.   IMHO, the USA has become litigation crazy with all sorts 
of product liability suits simply because many people have forgotten
how to exercise care and common sense.  It truly wouldn't suprise me
if someone tried to sue the authors of pine (or some other software)
because they felt it didn't provide them with "addequate protection"
from making fools of themselves.

What I'm doing is using procmail and formail to process my
incoming mail messages.  If a message contains a Newsgroups
header I change it to Old-Newsgroups and then Pine won't ask
me whether I want to post my response.  Here's the recipe I'm
using:

:0 fhw
* ^Newsgroups:
| formail -i Newsgroups:

For more info about setting up procmail see my "Filtering 
Mail FAQ" that I posted this week.


Another thing I've done is set up my newsreader (nn) to
use this for mailing:

 | formail -i Newsgroups: | /usr/lib/sendmail -t

This way all messages that I mail from nn have an Old-Newsgroups
header rather than a Newsgroups header so that anyone who receives
it in Pine will not be asked whether they want to post their 
response to me.

I hope this is helpful,
Nancy

I just recently switched from Elm as a mail reader to pine.  Now, I have 
lots of mail folders already set up under Elm....  Is it at all possible 
to put all my elm folders and pine folders in the same place and allow 
pine to access my old elm folders? (did that make sense?)  Basically, can 
Pine use my Elm folders.

Some others are:

	"It's a poor plan that admits of no modification."

	"Mediocre minds tend to dismiss anything that reaches 
         beyond their own understanding."

	"None are so blind as those that will not see"

I agree. The fact that there are three of them and that they still
don't get the job done suggests we're too far down the wrong road.

This is a "strawman". No one is asking that it be made "fool proof".
All that is being asked it that a toggle be put in to defeat the 
feature or that the feature's default be made more conservative.

No, that's not it. The point was that it leads to the embarrassment
of innocent people who may not even use Pine. Reread my earlier 
posts; I'm not going to annoy people by recapitulating the thing for
yet a fourth time.

Subject: Problem: Error opening ... Disc quota full
Message-Id: <CzGHnM.Hu8@exodus.iti.gov.sg>
Date: Fri, 18 Nov 1994 09:14:10 GMT

Hi,

I have installed Pine mail on a Sun Sparc 20 and it was working fine
for several months until lately, the following problem occurs:

Whenever my user open a pine session, he/she gets a message

        "Error opening /var/spool/mail/xxx.lock. Disc quota full"

I have tried to remove all files from /tmp directory and increase
the swap space. But the error message keeps popping up.

Anyone has any idea how to over come this problem?
Please help.

Thanks
Yu Chung

The only problem with these suggestions is that they don't, in fact, work 
any more reliably than the current behaviour of asking the user whether 
he wants to post a reply to the newsgroup. If Pine did *everything* you 
asked, it would still be confronted with an ambiguous situation - and it
would either have to make an assumption according to your rules - which 
is *guaranteed* to be wrong some of the time, or continue to ask for 
guidance from the user after making a "best guess". 

If your experience is too limited to imagine WHY this is the case, then
just catch up with that recent discussion in comp.mail.headers/header-people.



BTW: By *your* criteria, tin and [t]rn are "broken" because they do not
label saved messages to indicate that they came from the news spool. 
( That is, unless you accept the convention that that is what the 
  existance of a "Newsgroups:" line means. )

Even if all newsreader developers agreed to "fix" this, it would
take years (and possibly forever) for old versions of the newsreaders
to be replaced by the new "fixed" versions.  Isn't it obvious that
Pine needs a solution that is compatible with all these "broken"
newsreaders?

Yes, Pine can read the folders set up my elm. Here is what you need to do:

Pine, by default saves mail folders in a folder called mail (small m) and 
elm used Mail (large M) or maybe it's the other way around. The point 
being that UNIX sees these as two different folders. Choose which one you 
want to use and move all of your mail folders into that directory.

Then check your .pinerc to make sure that pine will be looking in that 
directory for your saved mail.

Whereas I would like to be able to handle my email, news and www *and*
saved messages (with intelligent searches like in mh's pick command)
with one single unified and consistent interface (which does not mean
one single process, unless it was a multithreaded process).  I think the
makers of Pine have the right idea and Pine is currently my mail
software of choice.

I know this probably will make me look like a computer-illiterate, but
I'd like to think myself as a hacker who just wants to get his
communication needs satisfied with the minimum of fuss.

It would be entirely reasonable to only offer to post in response to
articles that come from the NNTP connection.  IFF the user wants to post in
response to something she has saved from news or mail, then let her ask to
post it.

I got a couple of hundred messages into a 500 message thread.  What are you
saying?  I have lots of experience, over 10 years of UNIX, but only about 6
or so playing with news user agents and mail user agents in source.  So what
is your point?

It is not hard to tell a message either is or is not from the nntp server.
All other cases should require the user to request to post.

Yes!  If I want to attach a document I choose attach and then click on the
file I want to send.  Eudora translates the document.  If the person I am
sending the file to is running Eudora, NuPop or some other intelligent mail
program, the file is automatically translated back to the right format and
the person can choose where to store it.  That's intelligent.

Nick, are you commenting on the user interface in Pine for attachment
(assuming you've got some form of attachments to work) or on the fact that
attachments don't work at all?  Here's an answer if the latter is the
question: 

There's actually two formats that are commonly used for attachments these 
days, MIME and uuencode (Surely that has been discussed here before??).

Uuencode is kind of an old defacto convention that has many short 
comings (not reliable over all links, ill defined, can't tag the type of 
attachment.) 

MIME is soon to the be the Internet standard for attachments, and is 
fully implemented in Pine.  Eudora is capable of doing both uuencode and 
MIME though maybe not all versions.  I suspect if you got your Eudora 
using friends to reconfig it for MIME you'd find it operating quite 
intelligently!  

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by translation.  Pine and Eudora should 
do just fine for text files and binaries if you just want to move the 
bits around.

(snip)

Whereas the separation might usually be useful, special circumstances 
sometimes make it helpful or necessary to mail to a newsgroup. Just 
having the address should be all that it takes. I am told that the form: 
news-group-name@internet.address would do it, so I ask:

1. Is that correct?
2. How can one ascertain the "internet.address" portion of the above from 
a newsgroup heading? For example, to what address would one send a 
message via mail to news.newusers.questions 
(news-newusers-questions@what.address)?

If you do decide to take on the Mods, PLEASE make them a globally addable

WYSE50's are USEABLE, but not terribly fun for our new users to try and

	Yes, that goes a long way to proving that there is more than one

	Maybe I've not interpreted this correctly...but on Date: 17 Nov 
1994 10:43:39 -0800 you stated:

	Chances are you need to go back and re-read your posts:

Since you missed it the first time, I'll try again with an example: You

asking what owners of Acme think. I own an Acme and don't like it at all.
Rather than post a reply and get flamed for not liking Acmes, I email you

I'm sorry, but it does not. In the scenario, I am replying to a
public posting via private email only. The message I send is not
posted to the newsgroup and there is no implication that it was.

------End reruns-----

	Let's make a little graph from what you said on 14 Nov 1994.

	User A (pine user)			User B (non-pine user)

1.	Posts message to a newsgroup		Replies, via email from within
	using Pine.				newsreader.

2.      Reads message.				Eats cheese doodles.

3.	Replies to message and is offered to    Sips on favorite drink.
	post as well.

4.	Missed second prompt and posted reply.  Gets really embarrassed and
						down right angry.


	Unless User B's newsreader left the Newsgroups header on the reply....
how do you think pine got the impression that the discussion was on news?

	Not too long ago, I'd sent a priviate email to someone in our HQ.
In his reply the individual Cc:'d several others.  I wasn't very happy
about that.  But, if the UA that the other person was using would have
been configured to prevent addition of Cc's to replies...or if it gave out
the warning, "You've added Cc: in a reply to a message that was directed
solely towards you.  Please reconsider as you may embarrass the innocent
person that originated the message" ... I may have been saved.

	Maybe UAs should also be configured to prevent people from editing
the original message that they are forwarding?  I'm sure you know what
evil things can happen when people are quoted out of context.
	
	IMHO, people that are naive enough to think that what they say
in a "private" exchange will not be repeated or seen by others are....
well...naive.

	IMHO, people that make statements that are a potential 
embarrassement should be prepared to accept the consequences should their
remarks become public.  People that make potentially embarrassing statements
are not "innocent".  They are careless.  If they cannot accept responsibility
for what they have said....they are weannies.

First problem:  Using Telnet and can't seem to get the delete key to work.

2)  In Pine, ^C is not responding, other keys are

3)  I would like to broadcast an address change to my address book.  Is 
this possible?

4)  Or, if I include my three seperate lists in bcc, can I tell Pine to 
delete duplicates?

5)  Somehow Pine crashed after I had been working on problems 3 and 4 and 
all my work (an hours worth) of deleting duplicate addresses was lost.  
Sometimes Pine will save the message to be resumed later but not this 
time. Why?

Thanks for the help in advance, I am very frustrated!

The de-facto standard for the number of columns that you get when you tab
is eight spaces.  The five spaces that you want is not normal.

Or aphorisms--especially "Universals".

In your graph, you indicate "User A" posted from Pine. I believe
Tin was used, but don't think it matters. Both real users used
Pine and Tin: Pine for email, Tin for newsreading, I believe.

Interestingly, when "User A" tried to delete the offending message
using Tin, it couldn't be done. My test confirmed this. Usually 
you can delete your own messages, but not in this case. When Pine
makes an ass of a user, it does it up right.

Who gives a damn? This is a red herring anyway.

(You would have me believe that Pine is some kind of mindless mailer
that has to rely on Tin to tell it stuff, when your camp says Tin 
is "broken"?)

Look, make the feature able to be toggled off and/or make the default
more conservative. And quit trying to shift blame. It's unseemly.

The fact that some people fail to keep secrets means that private 
emails should be posted publicly?

"Weannies"? Jeez.

I knew this would become a "manhood" issue sooner or later. 

"Accepting responsibility" has nothing to do with it. The fact is,
as you know, that we all speak more frankly and openly in some
situations than others and that we may shape our remarks according
to who we are talking to. I'm not necessarily going to be as candid
with my boss as with my wife, anymore than you're going to tell the
cop who just pulled you over for speeding the first two words that
popped into your head when you saw him in the mirror.

You can't reshape the norms of human behavior to accommodate an 
errant feature of Pine.

Ok, ok, I`ve found the problem. It was me, not pine!
Sorry for wasting your time with this.
Pine IS working, the bug I found was in my brain and nowhere else. =0

Thanx...

There are several sites that provide this service for most (if not all) 
of the "worldwide" newsgroups.  You can probably find a list in Scott 
Yanoff's "Internet Services Guide" in news.answers.

Hi,
	I've just installed Pine 3.91 on Solaris 2.3 with SUN's C 3.0
When I go into Folder List, other than INBOX, all my other mail files
that were created with unix mail, are missing the first 2 characters
in the file name.  (They are in a directory called mail if that makes
a difference.)
	Has anyone else seen this, or have a fix for it.  I'm just starting
to go through the code.
	Thanks,
	Nancy.

Speaking of statements that are a potential embarrassment...

Maybe, since you make such statements public, you have no concern for what
you say in private, the rest of the world may feel different.

Can I assume that you feel the same way about anything your say to your
banker, clergymen, spouse, etc?

While I think you make some good points in your post, I think it is a 
severe distortion of the facts to declare this usage some sort of 
existing de facto standard. In fact, a number of different programs - 
news readers and mail<>news gateways and others have been using both
"Newsgroups:" and "X-Newsgroups:" in inconsistant ways for some time. 

There is in fact no existing de facto agreement on the meaning of 
"Newsgroups:"  ( and even the meaning defined in rfc1036 for news messages
is too loose to be useful - thus Henry Spencer's attempt to tighten 
up and disambiguate some of those definitions in "Son of rfc1036" ) 

To imply that there has been some sort of universally accepted convention
which "newer software" is violating is a distortion of the facts. 

The reason this has NOW come to be an issue is that people (and programs)
would like to be able to determine whether something was a private reply
or a public posting, thus some standard way of labeling that would be 
useful.  Useful, but judging from the lact of consensus on what that
standard ought to be, unlikely. 


Lacking any such standard, the best a current program ( like Pine ) can
do is to indicate to the user that this message MIGHT have been a public
posting, and ask the user what he wants to do about it. It is certainly
not the program's fault if the message is ambiguous or if the user 
guesses wrong.

If I change my working directory before entering pine (to say ~/sub) and 
then read-in or write-out (^R or ^E) files, everything works as expected 
and the files are stored and found in the specified directory.

But, if I use the ^T option under the same conditions, the files 
displayed are /always/ the files in my home directory, and to get back to 
~/sub requires G sub.

To my taste, pine should either respect the selection of a working 
directory consistently or require a full explicit path consistently.

Perhaps there's a flag that can be set to control this behavior.  If so, 
I haven't found it (but can't claim to have worn out any electrons looking).

All,
This has happened to me, I responded to a public post via private
e-mail and my private e-mail ended up back as a public post. Reading
here and in conversion with the respondent of my private e-mail, I
believe a combination of his hurry and Pine's option was the cause.

BTW - My post was in good taste and I was not embarrassed by the 
incident. I have send other private e-mail, where I would have
been upset to see it go public. 

I see lots of finger pointing and casting of blame, but I see it
very simply...

Pine should NOT offer an option to publicly post if it came from
private e-mail. If Pine cannot reliability determine if mail is
private, then it should treat ALL mail as private and offer no such
option.

If we are to err, let us do so on the side of privacy.

Regards,
Dennis M. Maurer

Pine does just exactly what, I believe (from, admittedly my own small 
sample of users), Pine users *want* it to do. If you were able to somehow
convince the Pine developers that your suggestion was a good idea, 
then I'm sure many current Pine users would go looking for another program
that does what they want. Making it *impossible* for users to do what 
they want/need has never been a good rule of user interface design.

i.e. the customers/users WANT email/news integration, and what we need
are firmer more explicit standards for messaged to assist this 
integration. In the mean time, Pine does the ONLY REASONABLE thing: 
it asks the user what HE wants to do with the message. 

[ I expect with even newer ways to reply to messages, like from a 
  WWW server via a HTTP client ( perhaps via an imap <-> html gateway, 
  like the one I've been working on ) you will see even more of this 
  sort of integration confusion. ] 

Changing Pine is not a viable solution. ( i.e. changing Pine is possible,
but it's not a solution to the problem. ) 


Amending the news and mail standards to disambiguate the situation would
be a better approach.  The question then is what those standards should
be, and whether even that will do what you want - avoid a human decision
( that may be incorrect ) about the disposition of the message. 

I think the simplest solution is that the standards be 
tightened to require that "Newsgroups:" means what it appears to mean -
that that message has been posted to the following newsgroups. 

I don't think that change will remove the need for a human decision
at some point in the process, but I think it will be helpful and useful
enough to be worth the effort.

Don't compile Pine with /usr/ucb/cc.  (see "which cc")

You must use /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc

Make sure you compiled with "./build sol", not "./build sun"

You've linked in the worthless UCB emulation library somehow.  That

	I installad Pine with my Linux slackware package. Now I have had some
very strange problems. Pine won't start. It just does nothing. I can't figure
out what is wrong. Can anybody? This problem just came up. I did no changes to
any configuration files. 

	And another questionn, wherefrom can I find the latest version of 
pine? I know, this is a FAQ but I desperately need that information. You can 
e-mail the answer to me to cajrosen@polaris.utu. Thank you very much!

Not what we're asking, and you know it. We're asking that one stinking 
toggle be added or the default changed.

What's the big deal in asking one more toggle be added to prevent what
has already happened from happening to other innocents? Where does the 
concept of "customer" or "user" mentioned elsewhere by Mr. Majewski 
fit in to this attitude: if you don't like it, go make your own?

A value judgement. "Useless" to you. Desireable or essential to others.

I appreciate that it's free, but that doesn't necessarily mean criticism
should be rejected.

When printing from pine V3.91, i select attached-to-ansi, and it will not

OK - *I'm* not irrevocably opposed to toggles in the config file. 
As you said: I can't believe one more would hurt. 
If you're not getting a reasonable hearing from the Pine team ( or
from other folks like myself who jump in to defend them ) it may be
because all of the previous threads on this subject have made everyone
a little defensive and combative. i.e. it's gotten into name calling
about whose software is "broken" and not how to best deal with the
problem. 

 But I do strongly resist labeling it as a "Pine problem". 

 As I noted in that discussion, I have some alpha WWW gateway code that
will inevitably run into the same problem - it will typically be taking
messages from a public-archive of messages, but there is no unambiguous
way for the program to know whether it is a public archive or a store 
of private messages. If I add the capability to respond to messages 
( which it doesn't currently have ) I will have to do basically the same
thing - and it's unlikely ( because of the stateless nature of HTTP )
that this will be user configurable. In fact, because of the round trip
overhead of asking for confirmation, it's unlikely to be as insistent 
as Pine about "are you sure..." 
  
 I think increasing mail/news and other message integration is an 
inevitable trend. 

 Todays issue of Network World has an article headed: 

	"Universal in-boxes await more standards.
	Vendors working together to link voice, E-mail, fax, EDI into 
	one interface."

This article is not discussing IETF standards, but Electronic Messaging
Association standards, however, whatever they come up with, the internet
will probably have to deal with in some manner. 

The internet is bigger than usenet news, and it is going to have to
deal with a wider range of integration problems than this one.

	I have a *major* problem with changing the default operation.
I work with users of pine in Tawian, Thailand, Mainland China, Korea,
Malaysia, and Singapore.  Everytime defaults are changed in programs
such as pine there is major confusion....and frustration...and *not*
on my part...but my "innocent" users.  I don't believe my situation
is unique.  

	I have a problem with adding more and more toggles to software
that *really* doesn't need it.  While un-scientific, my little experiment
with my cc:Mail users proved to me that pine was not as evil that some
people make it out to be.  Again, when my users in other countries
have to deal with more toggles that don't enhance the software.....
I recall one post suggesting that 3 additional toggles be added.  The
wording of the toggles and the possible combinations would give some
native English speakers fits.  It is magnitutes worse for people here
in Asia.

Please!  It is not a severe distortion of facts to say what I said.
Like the man said, 'read my lips':

   When you send a private response to a Usenet posting, the
   Newsgroups: header in the private response tells the recipient that
   you are responding to a Usenet posting, not to a previous email
   message.

All the more powerful news readers have worked this way for some
years.  If they include a Newsgroups: header in private mail sent in
response to a usenet posting, this header is consistently used mean
what I said it means.   I do not know of any news reader (before pine)
that includes a Newsgroups: header in a private response to a Usenet
posting for any other purpose.  If you know of counterexamples, please
describe them.

Some communications software intercepts ^C.  A work-around in Pine is 
that you can type ESC ESC c to get the same thing as a ^C.  If that 
works, that means your software is intercepting the ^C before it gets to 
Pine.

I think you mean that you have the same address in several different 
lists in your address book, and you'd like to change them all.  There is 
no easy way to accomplish that from within Pine.  You could use an editor 
outside of Pine and use the editor's global substitute command to do it.  
You have to be sure not to change tabs into spaces or add or subtract any 
tabs, though.  (You should make a backup copy first.)

Something you could do to help with this problem in the future is to use 
nicknames in your address book lists.  That is, the list members can be 
nicknames that appear elsewhere in the address book (or some other 
address book of yours).  That way, if that address changed you'd only 
have to change it in one place and it would propagate to the lists at run 
time.

No, we haven't done that.  Typically (in my experience, anyway) the mail 
transport agent will eliminate the duplicate copies for you when it sends 
the mail.

I'm not exactly sure what you're saying you lost.  Address book changes 
are written out to the address book file as you make them, so you can't 
lose more than the change you're working on (unless it manages to blast 
the file or something).  If you do get crashes we would like to hear 
about it (pine@cac.washington.edu) along with as much information as you 
can give us.  There is a Bug report bug in the main menu in 3.91 to send 
a bug report to us.  If you are using version 3.90, there were some bugs 
that are fixed in 3.91, the current release.

Pine does NOT "include a Newsgroups: header in a private response" 
--presuming that "private response" means an *email* reply.  I think it is
clear that Pine is correct in this behavior, as it avoids the ambiguity that
everyone is concerned about. 

The issue at hand has to do with messages *not* created by Pine.  In
particular: under what circumstances users should have an opportunity to
OPTIONALLY follow-up, via news, a message sent by some *other* program that
happens to include a Newsgroups header. 

Note that the oft-repeated suggestion that Pine simply infer the correct 
action based on the transport protocol in use is, as has been mentioned 
previously, infeasible.  NNTP is not the only way to access news in Pine, 
and even if it were, there are other situations where the original 
transport protocol cannot be reliably determined.

See my previous posts for more details and possible alternatives.

Thanks, I stand corrected, I was making an incorrect assumption 
about pine includes a Newsgroups: header in private email.

By 'a message' were you referring to private email?  If so:

Posting to Usenet in response to private email is never an appropriate
action -- at least not one that the mail user agent should include in
its menu.  If the sender of the original email had wanted a public
discussion he or she would have posted to Usenet instead of sending
private email.

In effect you are asking a question roughly like this:

    The issue at hand has to do with what to do if somebody
    whispers privately in my ear.  Should I optionally shout
    out my reply?

Only if one has no manners at all, I think.

I do not understand why this is even an issue.

All right, I personally can't think of a counterexample off hand, but gnus
might be one; I'm not so familiar with it.

In any case, the numbers of newsreaders that work this way don't affect
the fact that it is plainly and intuitively broken behavior and rampant
violation of any logical standards process.

What these newsreaders are doing is copying over headers from a replied-
to message into a format for which they are undefined.  If this copying
was happening because that module of the program didn't understand the
headers, this is ridiculous; would we want this behavior for headers
like Content-Type?  If it's for some other reason, it's equally absurd;
it preempts an undefined but potentially useful header, changing the
semantics radically from the only place such a header was and *still is
currently* defined, and using it to include metainformation not about
the message in which it occurs but about the message to which it is a
reply and the specific means by which that message was read.  This is
completely different than anything in any RFC for either email or news;
the only other thing that ever is indicated about a replied-to message
is its Message-ID, which defines a standard of encapsulation that this
*awful* behavior wrt the Newsgroups: header gratuitously breaks.

I have a link from my PC to a distant (network-wise) machine, that drops 
packets very often. Using ping, I find that about 20% of the packets are 
dropped regularly -- sometimes 40%, sometimes 10%. But never 0.

Who is responsible to retry the packet transmission on an open socket? Are 
there any parameters, that I should set either in Winsock, or the application?

I have HUGE problems using telnet and Imap (from pine.) On the other hand http 
and ftp work normally. 

How come? What to do?

P.S. I'm using Trumpet Winsock 2.0b on my pc and pine-3.91 for Winsock.

The problem is that there are two conflicting meanings for the Newsgroup
header in an Email Message. If I reply-via-Email to an Article, it is the
Newsgroup Header of the message I am replying to. OTOH, if the Email is a
Dual Posting/Reply (such as is created by the use of a Cc Header in Pine)
then it lists the newsgroups that the message is being posted to as the
Email copy is being sent. It would be much simpler if Pine (and other
agents) that leave the Newsgroup in an Email Reply were to do so via the use
of separate X-Header fields that show the meaning. For Example,
X-In-Reply-To-Newsgroup for the Reply to Article case and X-Also-Posted-To
for the dual Post/Reply [The actual Header names are just examples]).

It is my misfortune to have posted a problem that is seen as related
to an issue in a religious war. But that in no way excuses those who
could do something about it from being intellectually honest enough 
to listen openly to what I say has happened, and looking fairly and 
honestly into what can be done--without subsuming it in their jihad.

Mr. Majewski has suggested the need to understand the background and I
appreciate the need to do that now, after slogging through
comp.mail.headers. It is just as necessary for Pine people to look at 
what I say has happened without assuming it is just a smaller part of 
their religious war. It's not. I'm not in their religious war and don't
want to be. I just don't want my private email posted in newsgroups 
while everyone is arguing back and forth about arcane header issues.

What a crock. 

We're talking about adding 1--maybe 3 toggles(?)--tops. One should do
it, I think. Or we could just change the default back to the way it was 
before. Fewer choices to confuse your users or--outrage you.

Many more toggles were added moving from Pine 3.89 to the new version.
(Users used to have to root around in .pinerc to find out how to set
things--much more confusing than the new configuration setup screen.)

Were your users thrown irretrievably into confusion with all those
new toggles? 

Did you make a fuss commensurate with the number of new toggles?

But it *does* need it, as I and others have explained. Your

A fair hearing of the problem, let alone of proposed solutions, has

Message-Id: <CznoKr.DsD@world.std.com>
Date: Tue, 22 Nov 1994 06:26:51 GMT

I've run into a few problems with Pine under IRIX that maybe there
are known fixes for.  We are currently running v. 3.89, but I have
built 3.91, and the staff is testing it.

a) Under both versions, if a customer starts up Pine and is over his
   disk quota, or goes over his quota while reading mail, Pine 
   segfaults and dumps core.  

b) If I go to the list of newsgroups and Goto misc.test, browse that
   group, go back to the List, and then Goto wstd.test (a local
   group), Pine aborts.  This is under 3.91.

c) Under 3.91, I am able to read news, but not post.  We keep out news
   in a spool, i.e., /usr/spool/news/comp/mail/pine.  In my .pinerc 
   file, I have the lines:

	nntp-server=news.std.com
	news-collections=News *[]

   It appears that pine is trying to connect to the nntp-server via
   nntp.  Perhaps I should unset nntp-server?


Any tips, comments, help, pointers, etc, would be appreciated.

This _must_ have a simple answer.

I can send a mail message from our central VAX to an address at,
say, aol.com or tolkin.enet.dec.com or something and it goes through
no problems. If I try to send the same message from pine on my own
workstation (AIX 3.2.5) it doesn't go anywhere and bounces back with
an 'unknown host' error. Not knowing very much about mail, I don't
even know where the problem lies. Can I reconfigure pine so that this
doesn't happen, or do I need to go further down the layers?

Hoping somebody can help me out!

Others have posted diffs for their versions, but we haven't looked at

	There was, and frankly still is, some confusion.  However, since
the move from 3.89 to 3.90 brought about easier configuration and added
enhancements there really wasn't much to complain about.  Along with
that, I am not on the pine development team.  There was no previous
discussion as to how things should/would look.  

	I'll assure you there was confusion and problems when the
changes were made between 3.90 and 3.91 that involved how the lookups
in the password file were handled.  There may have been a discussion
about that on this list....but I don't recall.

	Intresting set of logic.  I make a simple statement about "some
native English speakers" and it equates to my not liking pine.  How
do you do that?

As a matter of fact, most of them do better than some of the native English
speakers I've encountered.  They tend to read the FAQs carefully...and they
tend to read the prompts presented to them.

	Sounds as if you will need to go further down the layers.

	pine is the "easy" part of the equation.  If you are setting up
email for the first time on a workstation you will have to get your
MTA (Mail Transport Agent), which is most likely sendmail.  Depending
on how you want to do things...you may also want to configure your
system to utilize DNS.

Some people have complained about poor performance in opening mbox-format
mail files in Pine 3.91.  The patch below to pine/imap/c-client/bezerk.c
fixes the problem.  I'm not sure why it should make a difference, but it
does.

This bugfix will be in Pine 3.92.

My guess is that its not a pine problem, but a sendmail configuration
problem on your RS6000. Check the file /etc/sendmail.cf. If you find a
line which starts with OK, then my guess is wrong. But if you find no
such line, or one that is commented out (starts with #OK), then either
add a line

OK MX

or

OK ALL

I never understood the difference between the two, I use OK ALL and it
works. I also never understood why its not configured this way by
default. 

You have to do `refresh -s sendmail' afterwards. You need root
privileges to do all this.

You are correct in your "rough summary".

The problem/issue is that Pine decides whether somebody whispered to or 
shouted at you by means of the absence or presence of the "Newsgroups:" 
header line in the message.

If "Newsgroups:" is present it assumes you were shouted at and, when you 
start a reply, offers you the chance to shout back.  If "Newsgroups:" was 
absent then it assumes you were whispered to, and doesn't offer you the 
chance to shout back (although you can if you *really* want to by 
manually typing in a newsgroup name into the "Newsgroups: header field as 
usual).

The problem is that some *other* news readers allow you to "reply by 
mail" to a news article but, naughtily, include the "Newsgroups:" header 
line in that reply.  This means that if the recipient is using Pine it 
assumes the message was also posted to a newsgroup, and hence offers the 
chance to shout a reply back.

The current argument raging is whether Pine is "broken" because of 
interpreting the presence/absence of the "Newsgroups:" header can be 
interpreted as implying the message was posted to News.  Or whether the 
other news readers that *do* include the "Newsgroups:" header line in 
e-mail messages are "broken" and Pine's behavious is correct.

For my money I think Pine's behaviour is entirely reasonable, and that 
ideally the other "broken" news readers should be fixed.  However the 
realist side of me realises this will be difficult/impossible.

However in one sense it is little different from the uptake of MIME aware 
mail readers.  I am sure there will *always* be non-MIME aware mailers 
around, leading to complaints from people about these "broken" MIME 
mailers sending them files as these mysterious and unusable "attachments".

More power to Pine, is what I say.

Yes, this is a frequently encountered problem when building Pine and/or 
imapd.  Blame SUN for its broken compilers and runtimes that let you 
compile in one environment (BSD vs SVR4) and link in another.

We've received innumerable suggestions from the net of how to fix it.  
None of the suggestions work, or rather, none work all the time.

The pre-built binaries on the ftp.cac.washington.edu FTP server are 
correct, so unless you need custom modifications you are better off using 
these.

	From this discussion I've drawn two conclusions:

1.	Some people feel pine needs to be changed.  Others feel the change
	is unnecessary.

2.	Neither camp will convince the other camp.

	As it is their ultimate decision, I'm content to leave the decision
in the hands of the authors of pine.

This is wrong.  As I mentioned before in comp.mail.headers,
it is established behavior for news readers to include a
Newsgroups: header when one sends private email in response to
a Usenet posting.  The Newsgroups: header tells the recipient
where the original posting was to which a private reply is
being sent.

More importantly, it makes little sense to assume that somebody who
sends you private email in response to a Usenet posting wants you to
post a public response.  If he had wanted a public discussion he would
have posted a follow-up in the original newsgroup instead of sending
private email.

I am now beginning to understand the pine model of a public discussion,
and I don't like it one bit.

Usenet model, assuming some hypothetical sequence of postings:

     A posts to a Usenet newsgroup.
     B sees posting, posts a follow-up.
     C sees A's and B's postings, posts a follow-up to A's posting.
     A sees C's follow-up, posts a follow-up of his own.
     B sees A's follow-up, posts a follow-up of his own.

Corresponding sequence in the pine model, which I now realize is much
more broken than I thought at first:

     A posts to Usenet newsgroup.
     B sees posting, sends A email and also posts a copy to Usenet.
     C sees A's posting and posted copy of email that B sent to A.
       C sends email to A and also posts a copy to Usenet.
     A gets email from C, sends reply to C, and also posts a copy to
       Usenet.
     B see's copy of A's email to C which was posted on Usenet, and
       sends an email reply to A and posts a copy on Usenet.

If you had a slight bit of trouble following the second sequence,
you may be getting my point.

I hope you observe the complexity of the pine model as I understand it,
the unnecessary duplications, and the cause for confusion between what
is private email and what is not.  It's as if a lot of people are
carrying on a public discussion by alternating whispering to one
another and repeating loudly what they just whispered.

With all due respect to the pine authors:  You did a great job of
writing some of the best email software around, but you are applying to
it a badly broken model of how public discussion should take place.

I've set up Windows Pine so that while the executables are stored on the 
local HD (C:\PINE) , the pinerc is on my N:\ drive (personal space on 
one of our servers). I've done this as a preliminary test to possibly 
putting a similar setup on our Open Access computing facilities so that 
students can use the the same mail program. These computers, at log in, 
load the person's N: drive and this is the area which by default all 
their work is stored. The N: drive would just hold the PINERC file (and 
addressbook, newsrc files) -- all mail would (unless they alter the 
pinrc file) be remote and continue to be stored on another of our 
servers running IMAP.

I'd just like to check that I've set the various options correctly so if
anyone has done a similar sort of thing I'd appreciate some help. 

What I've done is:

1. In the autoexec.bat file an environmental variable is set with the 
command SET PINERC=N:\PINERC

2. In Windows Program Manager the File Properties of Pine are
   Command line: C:\PINE\PINE.EXE
   Working Directory: N:\

Problems:
1. There is a significant delay before the Pine Main Menu opens (okay, 
it's a network drive) and a beep from the computer indicating that all 
is not well.

2. There is a build-up of "rc<number>" files on the N:\ drive which 
appear to be temporary versions of of the pinerc file (same length).

Is there anything in the setup which I can change to allow quicker 
access and no creation of those rc files?

As we have already discussed, the 'dual postihng/reply' is presumptuous
and confusing and should not be used.

And in any case:

There is only one established meaning, and it's not the one pine is
using.  When it's you vs everybody else, you will generally lose.  Pine
loses.

The sendmail replacement that comes with MMDF update 43 (and presumably other
versions as well) does not support bcc: fields correctly.  It sounds like
you've got Pine set up to talk to that sendmail.  Two options:

1) Configure Pine to send mail via your MMDF SMTP listener.
2) I've got some code (for Pine 3.90 currently but I'll do it for 3.91 once
   I've managed to get hold of it) that interfaces Pine directly to the MMDF
   submit routines.  Come back to me via email if you want a copy.

For the record: sending mail from Pine directly into PP via its 
"sendmail replacement" also suffers from this.

Printing: With ver. 3.89, printing "attached-to-ansi" works fine both 
with telnet (cutcp) and with Reflection.  With 3.91, there is a quirk using 
Reflection (but not cutcp).  After 30 to 60 lines, something occurs which

	(a) forces a line feed without a carriage return,
	(b) ejects the page when the (truncated) line reaches the margin,
	(c) ejects an additional (blank) page (usually),	
	(d) turns off the "to printer" code in Reflection.

Note that I am using a Laserjet III with HP printer codes in my 
Reflection VT102 configuration.  Since Reflection is specifically 
mentioned as supporting this function in the Pine notes, I wonder if some 
bug has crept into the new Pine 3.91.  Using Reflection with version 
3.89, there is no problem. 

I have also had users using ProComm Plus have problems printing with 3.91
and not with 3.89. (We have a DEC Ultrix, that is to be retired next month,
running 3.89 and DEC OSF1 machine running 3.91.)

Maybe, since you make such statements public, you have no concern for what

Can I assume that you feel the same way about anything your say to your

Ed,
You miss the point, the whole discussion is about the right to privacy.

You also ask me to take it off-line, when the problem is that off-line
messages are somehow getting put back on-line. I find this a dubious
solution.

But you are right, others may not be interested in my opinion of your
opinions. I will take this off-line, and trust you will do the same.

Did you evaluate all 64 new settings with the same vigor with which 
you hack away at this one?  Well, of course not.  Something else is 
at stake here now, isn't it?

Referring to the massive upgrade from 3.89 to 3.9x, we now have
the following in the configuration setup screens (FIVE of 'em):

5  Rule Sets
21 Value Settings (or similar)
38 Toggles
------------------------------
64 different settings, total.

You would have us believe one more (or three, possibly--but unlikely)
would be outrageously excessive.  I say that's a non-starter.

I don't want everyone to agree; I want a fair hearing of my complaint
*on its own terms*, not dismissal of it as a side issue in a bloody
holy war.  Some have listened openly, but it appears those in a
position to add a toggle aren't listening openly.

I'm having a tough enough time of it as it is without having to keep 
swatting at flies. I'd appreciate it if you'd get out of the road.

I downloaded pc-pine when I run it I get an error msg saying that
it can not find the tcp/ip driver.  I don't have tcp/ip.  I use uupc
to get my mail from a host machine.  Is it possible to tell pc-pine that
mail on this local machine and that I am using uupc.  If you know the
answer please send me mail or responde here.

Turn on tracing within the trumpet stack and see what you get. Compare a
ftp session with an IMAP session and see whats going on. There may be
a problem with the trumpet stack or its implementation of PPP.

Have you reported these as bugs to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu?

Pine is never supposed to crash.  If it crashes, it is a bug.  If there's 
a bug, pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu wants to know about it.

Since we don't have any IRIX systems, it would help very much if you can 
give additional information, e.g. if you can run a debugger on the core 
file and send us a stack trace, perhaps a display of some of the 
variables, etc.

Your surmise is correct.  NNTP is, at present, the only way to post from
Pine.  So, you need a functioning NNTP server to talk to in order to post.

Well, I thought it was private mail.  I was tricked by receiving private

Solaris Porting FAQ.  You have mixed and matched svr4 with bsd.  BSD src
cruft absolutely must be avoided.  You have to make sure your C compiler is
not including ucbinclude or linking with ucblib.  Get the porting FAQ from

Your complaint was heard quite some time ago.

Now pay attention to the answer:

The only possible ``toggle'' would be one which turns off the ability to 
follow-up to news postings.

We think that a news reader which does not allow you to post follow-ups
isn't very useful.  If that's what you really want, just erase the
nntp-server variable.  Then you won't have any more news posting.

PICO is built-in for editing headers.  IFF you have the right stuff in your
.pinerc, when you do a 'c' or 'r' AND move down into the message you are
presented with your choice of alt ed.  (I suppose it is alright to like vi,
but it is not very polite to speak of it except in whispers :)  ).

I posted the following on the 17th.  How did you miss it?

I want jove, which is set as my $EDITOR, so I have the following lines in
~/.pinerc:


# List of features; see Pine's Setup/options menu for the current set.
# e.g. feature-list= select-without-confirm, signature-at-bottom
# Default condition for all of the features is no-.
feature-list=old-growth,
        signature-at-bottom,
        enable-alternate-editor-implicitly


I then have:

editor=$EDITOR

in the ~/.pinerc, in case I change my mind to use JED or emacs or joe.

Whenever I page down from the headers it autoloads the editor.  NEAT!

I recently compiled pine3.91 on a next system running MachBSD.  I used
the command 'build nxt' and it built just fine.  It tests out fine on the
NeXTs.  However, connecting to that computer from a macintosh (IIci) running
system 7.0.1, everytime I hit 'return' to input a field in the compose section
(ie: to, Cc, Subject,Attchmnt), it asks for an attachment.  Control-C only
works correctly if I set the interrupt-process control-character to something
other than control-c.  Why is this?  oh, I'm connecting via telnet through
NCSA Telnet 2.6.
do the macintoshes have a different CR-LF set-up?  I connected to a pine
I know works, and it worked just fine, so it must be specific to my program.
Anyone know anything that I need to change?  I'd like to get it working
correctly before installing it.  Thanks lots, Scott.

See, this message is a perfect example of what is wrong with the pine
philosophy of news=mail.  I got this in private email, and unsure whether it
was really supposed to be private or not, I assumed it was private and kept
the response private.  Mail should be mail.  News should be mail.  If it is
both, the only reliable way to tell is if the author tells you.  When I send
it on both channels I say "Posted and mailed."  Of course if it comes from
nntp, then I know it is news.

Actually, this is a pretty good indication that this should be user
configurable.  I'm not going to take a side on which should be the default.

In .pinerc:

nntp-server=""

news-collections=""

That worked for me on 3.90a -- I assume it works in 3.91.

Although the subject says "Posting," I'm guessing you mean reading --
specifically bringing up a group.  My guess is that your tin does its own
threading -- I'd *much* rather have a threaded reader than a faster,
unthreaded reader.  (My tin lets the server thread, and I don't notice any
difference in starting a group.)

Your NeXT system has a broken telnet server.  Most NeXTs do.

But what if you are reading news using IMAP rather than NNTP?

In general you cannot rely on the delviery/access protocol to infer the 
"mailness" or "newsness" of a message (ie e-mail message or news 
article).  Instead some attribute of the message itself must be looked 
for.

It compiled on our HP-UX without any problems.

I imagine so. Even Ed and I are tired of it and have agreed via
private email to knock it off.

But as far as it being *in your mailbox* --you have to take that up
with the Pine people. (Lotsa luck!) They have a vision of news and 
mail inexorably converging and have somehow tied comp.mail.pine to 
your mailbox. I didn't do that. I merely POSTed an article to a 
NEWSgroup requesting a default be set more conservatively. I take no 
responsibility for it being in Rick Nebel's or anyone else's MAILbox.

	I believe you have 2 choices:

1.	Start pine with a '-d 0' parameter.

2.	Recompile after removing the -DDEBUG flag.

But the latter makes it impossible to get .pine-debug files later if
you want them, using the -d option.  I found the solution was to
change a line in osdep/os-sun.h from #define DEFAULT_DEBUG 2 to
#define DEFAULT_DEBUG 0.  ^^^for SunOS in our case.
This way you get the debug code included.

The former can be done with a shell wrapper if you don't want to touch
the code.

Hm.  I thought it was:

1. Some people feel pine needs to be changed.
2. Others feel nn, trn, tin, rn, and other news readers need to be changed.

I believe the confusion is arising because a *mail reader* is allowing
follow-ups to News.  Pine is acting as both mail reader and News
reader, but presenting the folow-up prompt indiscriminately regardless
of its current role.

Suppose you create a unified News/mail system, which comprises:

     1. A human being.
     2. The mail reader elm.
     3. The news reader nn.

Now you have to agree that this system, let's call it HEN
(human-elm-nn) integrates News and email, i.e., this system handles
both.  HEN has unergone extensive field-testing, and has not been
seen to get confused about what is private email and what is not.

What is the fundamental difference between pine and HEN, that causes
pine to consider situations ambiguous that do not confuse HEN?  If this
question can be answered, a solution can be easily found.

Well, three - binhex, the default used in Eudora.

Eudora uses Binhex, not UUENCODE.  It can decode MIME, but the default for
sending attachments is BINHEX, not Base64 (the encoding used in MIME).  This
is wrong, IMHO.  The default ought to be MIME for outgoing, and my opinion
is that it shouldn't even allow Binhex for outgoing messages.

If you're using Mac Eudora, there's a trick to using proper MIME
encoding so that Pine can read the attachments.  You have to be sure and
check the box labeled "always as Mac documents" as well as selecting 
"AppleDouble" for the encoding, or Mac Eudora will binhex.  The PC
version of Eudora is much better, offering a simple choice of MIME vs
Binhex.  Hopefully, the Mac version will switch to that interface in a
future release.

Since this message was Cc'd to Qualcomm, I ask them: when will you remove
outgoing Binhex from Eudora, to reduce this kind of confusion and stop
hindering widespread MIME acceptance?

First of all, thank you for speaking to the issue. I think what you have
suggested may not do what I want. I don't want to make it so I can't post
(although you may :), but rather, I want to prevent others from being able
to publicly post my private email to them. How can this be accomplished?
Is Mr. Peter da Silva, who just posted what's below in comp.mail.headers,
not on the right track? It looks eminently reasonable to me.


"This question should be made *optional*, with the default being *off*.
Then any user that is presented with this message has explicitly stated
(by turning the option *on*) that they understand it and can handle it. 
Users who don't know any better will never accidentally post to news."

The first thing I see is that IMAP is _very chatty_. There are lots of
IP packets flying around in both directons, mainly short -- 40-80
bytes. The waiting happens, when there is an outgoing packet and the
answer doesn't come for long.

How can I see what is in the packets themselves, so that I know exatly
at what point in the IMAP protocol is the witing?

Eudora never uses anything except MIME.  Even when it does BinHex or
uuencode, it uses MIME.

You're welcome to your opinion.  My opinion is that you are a loon.

BZZZZT.  WRONG.  Thank you for playing.

Selecting AppleDouble is sufficient.  Always as documents does not affect
the AppleDouble vs BinHex choice.

In fact, documents can be sent as MIME even when BinHex is chosen, if the
data type is marked in the mapping resources (equivalent to mailcap) as
having a superfluous resource fork & Macintosh type.

>version of Eudora is much better, offering a simple choice of MIME vs

Sure, right after Apple drops MacOS in favor of MS-DOS, and there are no
resource forks to worry about anymore.  And right after the IANA picks up
Apple's extensive type registry, so that the Macintosh type information is
no longer often the only way to figure out what's in a file.

You are sadly misinformed.  Eudora uses MIME even when BinHex'ing, and it
accepts all sorts of MIME.  I'm hardly hindering MIME acceptance.

Is it truly not possible to change the Pine code so that it does something 
like this?  Suppose the variable is called "post-from-message-folder":

if in newsgroup 
    reply means ask user whether to post, mail, or do both
else (i.e., if in inbox or message folder)
    if post-from-message-folder=true
        reply means ask user whether to post, mail, or do both
    else
        reply means mail
    fi

I mailed myself a news article from nn 6.5b3.  It did not bear the offending
Newsgroups: header.

I do not have the patience to put up with the others long enough to test all

The problem is that this conditional is unimplementable.

It is not deterministic that something is "mail" or "news", except in a
very restricted environment.  You then get into the business of deciding
what to do about false positives or false negatives.  What is particularly
frightening is that new environments being deployed use storage 
technology that are of the non-deterministic form. 

We would then have to deal with bug reports of the form: "Pine refuses to
let me send a reply because it says ``this message is news''" or "Pine
refuses to let me follow up to a news posting because it says "this
message is mail"''. 

This may satisfy a few noisy people who use broken news readers to send
mail, and who refuse to re-configure them not to do the broken thing.  But
it would lead to a support nightmare for us.  Worse, it makes us unable to
do things we need to do for the people who pay our salaries to work on Pine.

It's better to let the noisy people have their flame.  If necessary,
there's always the silent treatment.  After a while when they find that
nobody is paying attention to them, they'll go away. 

This isn't to say we aren't going to be refining the behavior of Reply. 
We will, as Terry Gray outlined earlier in this newsgroup.

You are asking for the impossible.  Anyone can post any data to which they
have physical access.  There is nothing that Pine can do to prevent it, 
since the user could post without using Pine!

If you don't want a message posted, do the following:

1) Make sure your messages don't have a "Newsgroups:" header unless they
   are going to news.  If you use Pine, this is done for you.  So, 
   consider using Pine instead of Tin to read news.

2) If you send a private reply to a news posting, and you are concerned
   about it becoming private, say something like: ``This is a private
   response, please don't post it.'' at the start of your message.

I do both.  There are frequently instances in which I need to make an
``off the record'' response to someone with information that is not public
knowledge.

Some individuals do neither, and they are the ones who have the problem. 
They use some other newsreader that puts Newsgroups: headers in mail,
assuming that a mail reader won't interpret it as an indication of public
posting.  This is a big assumption to make.  It is not justified by any
RFC. 

Pine didn't create the problem; this assumption was rendered false by
certain mail readers years ago.  Pine just seems to be the first widely
(massively?) disseminated mailer that defies this assumption.

HEN does not support a number of environments which Pine supports; it only
works in a very narrowly constrained environment.  HEN can not without
encountering the same problems, only worse due to its modality (see next
paragraph). 

HEN requires you to go modal; that is, to say ``put me in news mode'', and
``put me in email mode''.  Note that the user has to set the mode by
direct action, and can not go from one mode to the other without
completely exiting the current mode and losing all the state.   HEN also 
has a different command set depending upon the mode, and very different 
behaviors.

	How can I set my Pine 3.91 to use imapd instead of rsh? This is
a very important thing to me because I can't acces to my pop-mail because
my pine uses rsh. I am using Linux 1.1.54.

Your candor is appreciated.  We are no longer disputing the facts
(always frustrating for both sides) but opinions, and here there is
some room to agree to disagree.

Undefined by the RFCs, but defined by practice. 

May I respectfully remind you of the xmodem file transfer protocol,
which is far more standard and ubiquituous than any RFC can ever hope
to be, and yet is defined in none.  Neither are Kermit or zmodem
defined in any RFC -- if they can be considered defined at all -- yet
that has not prevented them from being useful.

Or of SLIP, which hundreds of thousands of people fire up on their Macs
and PCs everyday, which preceded its RFC.

I understand that TCP and IP too were invented before their respective
RFCs.

Standards are meant to codify or facilitate practice, not stifle it.
Those who disagree with this will be happier on the X.400 and X.500
committees.

I have a little essay about one-eyed camels and Pharisees which I will
email to you (with or without the Newsgroups: header, as you wish)
upon request.

And don't forget that we do have an RFC which by implication requires
email software to accept the Newsgroups: header.  It's the one that
says that it should be possible to feed any valid News posting to email
software.  By implication, any email software that can't handle this
must be considered to violate this particular RFC.  (I believe it's RFC
1036.)

Furthermore, the spirit of all the mail-related RFCs is that any header
with the right format should be accepted.  The email software is not
required to *understand* a header in order to transmit it.  Some, like
the Newsgroups: header in email (as well as Subject:) are for the use
of the human reader and their semantics are of no value to the
intermediate email software.

>This is

Please do ask me about the camel.

I've tried reading news with pine, and it works great.
But I miss some functions which I'm used to when I use tin newsreader.

Will postings be there forever if you don't delete them, or do you have 
to delete them to avoid getting lots of postings.
Is there a catchup feature?

Thanks!

Quite perceptive Mark, but not the whole story.  Within HEN there
is knowledge of what is being read -- News or email -- but HEN as
a system is like pine, in that it could be accessing either, or
both at the same time.

The critical difference is:

     HEN never posts a Usenet sollowup from a saved file.  It posts
     Usenet followups only when getting a Usenet posting from a News
     server, e.g., an nntp server or a file server with a News spool.
     Replies to saved files are sent only by email, and cc'd only
     to selected people, never duplicated to Usenet.

There is no need to remember where a saved file came from.

One possible definition of "saved file" is "a file in the user's
private file area".

Oops!  I mailed myself with the wrong mode, I did the equivalent of
forwarding the news article to myself with mail ('m' in nn).  I just replied
to this message from nn ('r'), which sends just to the original poster, and
when I got the reply in my mailbox, it does have the 'offending' header.
Had I done a followup ('f'), then the reply would have been put on the
newspool.  Sometimes modality is a good thing.  I have to choose a different
course of action to forward, reply, and group reply.

While I think the inclusion of the header sort of out of band is broken --
it really ought to be part of the attribution line only (which nn does in
addition to the header) -- since all the major newsreaders (except pine?) do
it, I have little chance of changing that.  While it is all well and good to
stand on principle on a matter of design elegance, it still will not fix the
damaged product of your elegant design and their broken ones.

All I want is a configurable choice, based on transport protocol or path,
that refrains from presenting my users with the choice of embarrassing the
person who sent them a private email.

I am leaving pine 3.89 installed, running 3.90 out of my own directories,
hoping for some sign of recognition that this might be a real problem for
real people, while the pine team seem intransigent in their hope that the
rest of the world can be dragged kicking and screaming to their cognitive
map.  I really believe that most people have a different cognitive map of
mail, which comes to you, and news, which you go get.

There you go, confusing me again.  If you are going to reply to me both in
my private email and in news, please do me the courtesy of indicating that
to me in the body of the message, something I always do when I both mail and
post a reply to someone.  As far as I know, I am only responding to news,
but with the info-pine gateway, who knows.  See, I don't like mailing lists
either.  If I could I would get all my mailing list stuff with news.

In response, I was mistaken, nn acts like everything else.  What is at issue
anyway is not what happens when I get mail from myself, but from all those
anonymous people out there on Usenet, whose tools I have no control over.

Short answer: no.

I can reconfigure mine, but I have no problem, I hardly ever send anything

Your arguments are suggestive of someone who designed a new car that gets
better mileage and performance, but must be driven on the left side of the
road, and then insisting everyone else in the other cars is crazy because
they refuse to change over to your way of doing things, and whenever you
crash into one of them, screaming and ranting that they should not have been
on the left side of your road.

Perhaps this is enough to satisfy us.  Share some ideas with us.  It
wouldn't obligate you to follow our suggestions anymore than the current
noisefest, but it might satisfy us.

When you are selling a new idea to people who are comfortable with the
modality of news and mail, persuasion and compromise would be preferable to
coercion.

You simply set the environment variable TZ a la Unix: set TZ=EST5EDT or 
whatever is appropriate for your time zone.

However, there is a known bug in pcpine_w 3.91 (read the enclosed
forwarded message) that makes this feature erroneus during daylight saving
time.

But some of us are very comfortable with modality here.  I am having a hard
time with the equation you are pushing:
 one-to-many=one-to-one

It just does not compute for me.

Yes, you have to explicitly delete them.  The pine team are strongly of the
opinion that mail and news are exactly the same thing.  Of course, the news
spool will ultimately expire them, but that is not what you mean.

You can select a bunch of articles, zoom them, read them, saving any you
want to, then select all the zoomed articles and apply delete to them, but
that is too confusing for me.  I am sticking with nn.

I would be happiest if I could deprive pine of all knowledge of news and
newsgroups.  The way I use tools is:  edit with jove, news with nn, mail
with pine.  If I wanted one tool for everything I would choose emacs on VMS
(the set/everything OS).  I want modality on some matters so that I do not
have to lose time thinking about things like is this private or public.

Good Answer! (but mail is still in the spool).

This is a *very* elegant statement.

After some thinking, I have come to realize that

     - Newsgroups: header in email
     - Offer to post a reply to Usenet
     - News == email or News != email

are all side issues.  The real issue is this:

     Usenet followups should be sent only when reading Usenet news
     "live", i.e., when a freshly-obtained posting (which you "get")
     is being viewed.  After you have "gotten" it and saved it, it
     becomes akin to email and no more Usenet followups should
     be derived from it.

I'm reminded of a number of sports in which the ball is "alive" (in
play) from a certain moment to a certain moment, and one may score
points during that time.  After some amount of play, the ball is "dead"
and no more points may be scored until it becomes alive again.

Well, Usenet is like that.  One does not followup to a "dead" Usenet
posting, one that has been plucked from the Usenet context and put into
one's personal folder.  Usenet is a game played in context.  One
follows up only to a "live" posting, one that has not yet become
"dead".  Nothing arriving by email is a Usenet posting (though it might
be a "dead", i.e., saved, copy.)  Nothing in one's personal files is a
Usenet posting (thought it might be a "dead", i.e., saved copy).

Pine wants to score points after the ball is dead.

Subject: PC-Pine standalone and remote folders
Date: 24 Nov 1994 15:33:22 GMT
Message-Id: <3b2bo2$mm0@hermes.achilles.net>

Hello, I'm converting over from Unix Pine to Pc-Pine. One of the reasons I'm
doing this is so that I can look over old mail without having to dial
in. However, if I start PC-Pine without Winsock, it takes *forever* to
get access to my local folders, as PC-Pine goes looking for the INBOX
first. Similarly, every time I use the L command to see my list of
folders, I again have to wait for network timeouts as PC-Pine looks
for my remote folders. Is there any way that I can use PC-Pine
standalone, so that I'm the one who tells it when to go looking for
the INBOX and remote folders?

On a related point, I did dial-in and was successful in moving between
local and remote folders (a wonderful feature: now I have to figure
out how to get access to my folders at Carnegie Mellon -- some problem
with authentication I think!). However, when I tried to save 12
messages selected in a remote folder to a local folder, it took
forever. I kept getting the "sorting..."  message. Why does this take
so long and is there anything I can do about it? I don't believe that
it's the speed of the link or my computer (I'm running 14.4 with
additional compression, on a 486/50 and the message texts aren't very
long).

Many thanks for any ideas,
David

As we used to say around the cyclotron, "you can make it fool proof but 
you can't make it grad student proof".  I suppose there is a cor0llary to 
this folk theorem about faculty members.

For purely private e-mail communication between individuals one can 
generally get away with blindly replying and not looking at the headers.  
In the presence of mailinglists, net news, mailinglists gatewayed to 
newsgroups, etc. there is no way to prevent the careless from sending 
mail to people and places that they don't intend.  There is simply no 
mechanical way to protect people from their inattention to detail.

In the past I have discovered that when the Pine team has a well thought 
out rationale for the design behaviour of Pine then one must have an 
extremely good argument to get them to alter the behaviour of Pine.  I 
disagree with some of the things that they do, like encoding pure ASCII 
attachments, but there is no benefit in continual argument about it.  The 
current issue is clearly another case.

If you don't like the behaviour of Pine then don't use it.  If you want 
different behaviour go write your own MUA/news-reader.  Bad mouth Pine to 
all your friends.  Just stop this endless chatter on this mailinglist.

Thanks.

On our AIX machine (14,000 users, many of whom are sending to AOL) we
use OK MX, which also works fine.  But we had to discover the hard way
after thousands of users got "aol.com: host unknown" messages.

This newsgroup is gatewayed to the mailing list. That mailing list was
around eons before the newsgroup. Some people don't have access to news
and STILL get it via the mailing list.

About a year ago, on the mailing list, we discussed the merits of proposing 
a news group. It was agreed that the group wouldn't be very useful unless it
was gatewayed to the mailing list AND the folks at Washington would 
participate in it.

Be thankful that we can get so close to people that actually develop this 
stuff, whether or not we agree.  Wait until Microsoft gets involved in
Internet software.  Doesn't work right? Tough shit, it might be wrong,
but it will be the "standard."

Pine has altered my behaviour in a lot of respects -- for the better. I 
get a lot of questions in email from students and staff here. I set up a
local newsgroup to answer these things. I get email, I strip out info 
identifying the user, I add the newsgroup line to the header, Bcc: the
original user, and answer the question.  The answer gets posted so 
everyone else can benefit from it.

Almost all of our new users now use Pine to use mail AND read news. This
is a tremendous win for us, via support. Only have to teach them one 
thing. As they get smarter and need more, they can graduate to trn, or
whatever.  Those of us who use stuff like trn (like I am now) should know
better.  We all have the sources to our newsreaders that are "broken" so
it isn't too difficult to stop them from adding a newsgroup line to 
private replies.

Sorry, but I changed my opinion on this. At first, I was pissed as hell
by the behaviour of pine. But as I read this thread, and more importantly,
seen how much pine has saved my department in support costs, I am DAMN
happy it works like it does.  

The only suggestion I have is to change the question/response from a
Y/N situation to something like.

Where do you want your reply sent? Public news, Mail, Both, Cancel (PMB^C)

That would catch people blindly hitting Y because something changed, and
they can say "Oy, what's all this then mate?" and stop and read and think
about what it is that is going on.

One feature that i would really like to see added to pine is an option
when creating the sending address

it would be nice at this point to be able to search the passwd file
inorder to get a person's username
optionally it would be more useful to be able to make a request to a
ccso server (such as pi/qh model) to lookup a person

To avoid misunderstandings: the OK MX or OK ALL isn't just for AOL.
You need it for any site which has some kind of central mail server
configured. My email address is an example.

If I send an Email via the Reply-via-Email Option, the News Agent KNOWS this
is an Email Reply and can state this in a header. If I use Cc in an Article
Post, again it KNOWS this and can set a Header in the Emailed copy to
document this. I fail to see how the News Agent can be confused about the
also-posted or not-also-posted status of an Email Message it is being asked
to send. Fixing this should then help Pine since it is not getting mixed
signals as to the status of an incoming Email Message.

I think this sequence qualifies as a dual posting/reply since the same text
creation is used to generate that Post and the Email'ed Reply. It is not the
same as my creating/uploading the Text once to do the post and a second time
to do the Email. I supply the text once and then I am run though the Email
and the Posting paths to supply the information on where to send it. The aux
script appending the indicia to the message is an alternative to this being
documented in the Email and News Headers via currently nonexistent/non-RFCed
Headers. The generation of separate Message-IDs for the News and Email
versions is acceptable since due to the modification of the Email Text, they
are not the same message (NN just gave you a fast path method of recycling
the Post text to become the Email text and logically it acted as if you have
sent the text as two separate operations).

Agreed.  The pine folks sometimes seem to be not listening, but I
believe they are listening very intently.  Pine's elegance as a mail
user agent could not have happened in a vacuum.

The problem with gatewaying News to email usually arises because the
email and News models are so dissimilar.  Email software is generally
designed -- with good reason -- to ensure that the user sees every
message, and no message is deleted without careful consideration.  News
software is generally designed -- with good reason -- to ensure that
the user sees no more than he explicitly wishes to, and that he finds
it easy to skip entire discussion threads, all postings from selected
people, etc.

The gatewaying leads to a serious conflict between the models.  Usually
it's the people who read via email who find it hard to cope.  They are
seeing too much.  Their email software is doing its job -- but it's the
wrong job.

Heh.  It's rare that I find a short paragraph with four short sentences
in which each sentence needs a rebuttal.

>If you don't like the behaviour of Pine then don't use it.

I think pine is a work of genius.  At this site it is the preferred
mail reader for most new users and many experienced users.  The only
reason I don't use it is because I need much more modelessness than
pine can give me, and because I handle more email in a day than most
people do in a month.  (Really.)  I use MH.

>If you want 
>different behaviour go write your own MUA/news-reader.

Won't work.  I don't think I could do as good a job.  It would be
impossible to convince pine users to switch.  They like pine too much.
And for good reason.

>Bad mouth Pine to all your friends.

Why?  I recommend pine to all new users.

>Just stop this endless chatter on this mailinglist.

This is a Usenet newsgroup as I see it.  Please see a previous posting
from me about the conflict between Usenet and email models that occurs
when a newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed.  Usually it's the
people who read the email who complain about seeing too much.

My wife has had trouble with her mail box being corrupted basically every
time she opens it (using Pine).

Necessary fix seems to be using an editor to get down to a line that
begins with "From..."

But, why does this happen so often?  I don't think it is anything she is
doing, but the sysop doesn't seem to know what is happening, either.

Help appreciated.

Hello,

Does anyone know if there is a way to configure Pine so that when I
send mail it brings up a customized header? In particular, I would
like to include a blank Fcc: line in the mail header AND turn off
Pine's default feature of copying all outgoing messages to the
sentmail folder. Any help would be much appreciated.

Much as I hate following up my own postings, I just did a couple of
extra checks.  In fact the last version I built was 3.88 not 3.89 as I
stated.  Certainly setting the userdomain to "@" didn't work back in
3.88 it results in mail being sent to userA@@ which is clearly silly.

So the obvious question is when was this useful feature added (and why
wasn't it given more publicity), and can I rely on it being maintained
for the forseeable future?

Message-Id: <J.S.PEATFIELD.94Nov25044605@kro.amtp.cam.ac.uk>

Last time I built pine (3.89) I read through all the docs and decided that I
couldn't have the From: and To: headers set the way that I want for local
users.  What I wanted was for pine to leave the totally alone and let our MTA
(sendmail/smail) rewrite them if they were leaving the site.  That is I
wanted pine to leave the headers just as I typed them in and to generate a
From: header with just the login name on it.  (After all this is what most
other MUAs do.)  I couldn't find a way to do this so I settled for setting
the userdomain to our site domain name.  This means that fro pien users even
internal mail is to userA@site and from userB@site rather to userA and from
userB.

Well I started looking at 3.91 recently (just after it came out in fact), and
it appeared that the same was true.

Can someone please explain to me why pine should get involved in setting the
domain part of addresses which can be correctly handled in the MTA?

Looking through the code I find that the addresses are passed round as
ADDRESS structures which get converted to strings by the c-client routine
rfc822_write_address(), which in turn calls rfc822_address().  In here I find
that setting the domain (via userdomain or whatever) to "@" has the desired
effect, though it is marked as:

>     if (*adr->host != '@') {	/* unless null host (HIGHLY discouraged!) */
>       strcat (dest,"@");	/* host delimiter */
>       strcat (dest,adr->host);	/* write host name */
>     }

This is the only mention of "@" as a domain that I'd seen anywhere in the
source or documentation, yet it is about the most useful default setting that
I can imagine in situations where you are talking through an MTA which will
perform the expansion if needed.

Can I suggest that the use of "@" as a userdomain to achieve this effect be
added to the documentation, or that someone point me at where it is
documented if I totally missed where it is mentioned.

Can I rely on this feature remaining in future versions of pine?

I have to endorse the comments given below by Ken Weaverling.  Much of 
what he says for Delaware Technical & Community College is equally 
applicable here.

One of the points he makes concerns the prompt:
   Post follow-up message to news group(s)?
He says:
> The only suggestion I have is to change the question/response from a
> Y/N situation to something like [the following prompt].
> Where do you want your reply sent? Public news, Mail, Both, Cancel (PMB^C)

At Durham, we have a hacked local version of Pine 3.91 in which the 
prompt has been changed to:
   Press Y to follow-up message to newsgroup(s) or N to reply to sender?
I know this is awful, but it is the minimum change that gives more
guidance to the user.

It was Terry Ratcliffe (University of Newcastle, UK) who suggested to me
that the text of the prompt needed changing.  My view was to use letters
other than Y and N.  So, I sent the following comment to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu on September 17th: 
> ... I would suggest responses other than Y or N, 
> e.g., given the prompt "Followup to newsgroups or Reply to author?", 
> F leads to "Newsgrps: aaaa" and R leads to "To: Joe.Sender".

Later, Terry Gray replied saying:
> We also weren't sure in this case whether to go
> with a three-state prompt and allow "both".

So I would now like the prompt to be:
   Reply to author, Follow-up to newsgroup(s), or Both?
and the options in the two line menu at the bottom give the possible
responses as ^C Cancel, R Reply, F Follow-up and B Both.

Subject: pine GUI ?
Message-Id: <1994Nov25.094929.1@ugun2a>

When one looks at pine on a Unix workstation, the first impression is often
negative because a User Agent should have a graphic user interface on systems
that support graphic.

Is there a good reason not to develop a GUI for pine (not to replace, but
in addition to the current full screen interface) ?
If not, is someone working on a pine GUI ?

I don't have a better idea, but if you are going to create another

	Situation:

My users have POP mail acces to a server. We need to connect that server

not support rsh connections but it wants to have imap(d) connection. The 
server is running Imapd (can't remember the version number, but it is a 
Bis-version). How to configure pine to make imap connections instead of rsh ?

When I choose to reply to someone, using pine, my signature is placed on top.
Is the some way to force the signature to be placed at the bottom.
I would like to think that it's prefered to have the message you want to 
answer on top, then your comments, and at last, your signature.

Thanks in advance!

Subject: imapd too strict?
Message-Id: <CztL2M.EFr@liverpool.ac.uk>
Date: Fri, 25 Nov 1994 10:56:45 GMT

We have found that the imapd which comes with pine 3.89 and 3.91 seems
rather strict about the Unix mailbox format. Maybe elm 2.4.23 is too lax but
it reads mailboxs without any trouble where imapd thinks that the mailbox
is one single mail item.

I've checked the tech notes without any success. Has anyone else seen
this sort of problem and does anyone have any ideas? These Unix style
folders were created from IBM VM/CMS notebooks after much testing to
make sure they conformed.

Thanks.

If you are using Pine 3.90 or later, from the Main menu you simply 
Setup-Configure.  There, you will find three options in relation with 
your question:
	default-fcc
	default-composers-hdrs
	fcc-name-rule
For more information on any option, move the cursor on the option 
and hit "?" for Help.

In addition, if default-composers-hdrs is left blank, the Fcc: header is 
still there, but hidden.  While in the composer, in the header part of 
the message, hit <Ctrl>R to see the full header.

Earlier versions of Pine also have these features, but you have to edit 
the .pinerc file manually.

Good luck.

This is what I do by setting the "signature-at-bottom" in Setup-Configure 
from the Main menu.

Date: 25 Nov 1994 14:42:03 GMT
Message-Id: <3b4t3r$hhv@nx2.hrz.uni-dortmund.de>

I received an email message which contained the following 3 header
lines (without the '- ' in front, of course):

- Mime-Version: 1.0
- Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
- Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

The body of the message contained the following line (a header line
from a quoted message, but thats beside the point):

> Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
 
When I look at this message with pine 3.91, I get at this point:

> Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charsetFormatting error: Non-hexadecimal character 
in QP encoding   [Error: 
]  ""

And the rest of the message is not shown.  Pine is of course right -
there is an error. The header said quoted-printable encoding, but the
text wasn't. The =US is the offending part. 

The error is obviously on the side of the originator of the message,
and I told him so. I would suggest however that pine should be more
lenient with this kind of errors and go on to display the rest of the
message.

   I do not agree.
   When I had to relinquish my earlier mail system (Rice Mail on an
   IBM VM mainframe) because the IBM was going to be discontinued
   (I was continuing to use it JUST for mail even if I had a work-
   station on my desk since two years), I looked into various
   possibilities, and I found those based on GUIs unbearable (I
   tried Ultrix dxmail and Sun's mailtool; also VMS GUI for mail is
   worse than line mode VMSMail, although slightly better than the
   Unix GUIs).

   I believe that one of the greatest advantages of Pine (particularly
   but not necessarily if used in conjunction with imapd) is that you
   can use the SAME interface from the workstation, from a PC, from a
   local or remote terminal (you do not need to use dreadful
   /usr/ucb/mail when you are logged in from elsewhere !)

   It is always possible (as we do here) to run Pine in a separate
   dxterm or xterm window.

   Long live Pine

	Is there any way to get a reply to a news post to be posted to the
news group *and* mailed to the poster of the news article without adding one
or other to the header yourself? Pine asks if you want to post to the news
group. If you answer yes, it posts to the news group; if you answer no, it
mails the poster. But it never does both... Does it? Thanks!

You can set the time zone with the TZ environment variable.
set TZ=ZZZ[+H]H[:MM:SSTTT]
everything in [] is optional

ZZZ = time zone
+H = offset from GMT
TTT = daylight savings time

the default is PST-8PDT

i.e to set to EST
set TZ=EST-5EDT

cac.washington.edu has a file tech-notes which explains all this.

	I sometimes get the following messages when tab'ing through news
groups and the final news group is empty and there are no messages to
unexclude (i.e. the news group has been empty long enough for all posts in it
to be expunged from the news server), after pressing enter at the "Return to
inbox" prompt. As soon as an article does appear in the news group, even
after it has been read, these messages disappear. Is this a bug? I don't
think I should get these messages under these circumstances (the group is in
my .newsrc file). 

No state for newsgroup found, reading as new

You skew my meaning, which since you are a smart man, I assume you
did maliciously. Pine 3.89 did not have the problem. I still think
the new version doesn't need to have it. I seem not to be alone in this.

I have tried this and IT WORKS! I sincerely thank you for pointing this 
out (50-100 posts into the topic). I will do this, since some at Pine are 
blinkered and will not accommodate.

I'm glad this works for you. It probably won't for me as in my scenario
we are talking about people who aren't reading the Pine prompts in the
first place. They're probably not going to read my cautions either. But 
otherwise it is also a good suggestion.

Again, I sincerely thank you for providing a workaround.

Hi,

I've spent a lot of time setting up sendmail to work correctly (including 
generating reverse-aliases), but pine creates it's own From: header. 
Sendmail then leaves it alone - which means I lose the reverse-alias 
remapping :-(

How much of a task is it to stop pine generating it's own From line?

In a previous article, J.M.L.Gorbold@bradford.ac.uk (Divine Intervention) says:

>does anyone know how i can write letters in pine using the pound sterling
>sign because whenever i do it asks me whether i want to emergency exit.

    First, you should set up Pine to indicate that the ISO-8859-1
character set is being used, else the messages will not be tagged
properly for display.  (There are other character set standards which
include the Pound Sterling, but the ISO-8859-1 is most widely used.)
In some environments, this is needed before Pine will accept any 8 bit
characters for text input.

    The Emergency Exit prompt you are seeing is caused by Pine seeing
the control-\ (^\) character.  So, apparently, however you are creating
your Pound Sterling character is either generating ^\ as a control
character, or maybe ^\ with bit 8 turned on (not sure about whether this
second possibility is also interpreted as emergency exit, however, if
your 8-bit characters are being stripped to 7 bits, this would also
be possible).

    The Pound Sterling character is an 8 bit character equivalent to the
US-ASCII character ``#'' (pound sign, octothorpe, whatever), but with
bit 8 turned on, when using the ISO-8859-1 (ISO Latin-1) character set.
You may have to somehow configure the communications program you use to
properly generate this character -- apparently you are getting the ^\
character instead.

    When your character set used in Pine is properly configured, and
the communications program you use generates codes corresponding to
the character set you select, you should have no difficulty generating
the Pound Sterling within Pine and using it in mail to MIME-aware
recipients.  Your current difficulties sound like a problem with the
configuration of the communications program you are using to type the
Pound Sterling character.

Is IMAP discarding information?

Consider this scenario:

     - The SMTP server on port 25, and the nntp server on port 119,
       both accept incoming connections, accept the email message or
       News posting, and put it into a common spool directory.

     - Another daemon process now extracts files from this common
       directory and, by looking at each file's contents alone -- tried
       to figure out what to do with it.

It would not get very far, right?  The out-of-band information that
was lost is critical and should not be discarded.

What are the differences between this version and 3.89?

Now we are getting somewhere!  The single biggest enhancement in 3.9x for me
is the enable-alternate-editor-implicitly command.  In 3.89 you are stuck
with the ^_ or whatever kludge.

If you want to have seamless use of another editor you must upgrade.  You
will also get all the selection features that have been added (plus the
potential confusion concerning news replies).

Steve,

Does this mean one should select AppleDouble all the time, only when
sending attached documents to Pine users, or never?

Per the instructions in the Pine reference manual, I've symlinked 
/usr/local/etc/imapd to /etc/rimapd in order to enable local 
authentication of IMAP use.

However, when I run Pine on the machine on which the imapd is running, 
I'm still prompted to type in my name and password.

How can I make it run right?  I'm runnig AIX 3.2.5 on a cluster of IBM

If you have root access, get Richard Gooch's PGPsendmail at
ftp.atnf.csiro.au:/pub/people/rgooch.  It's a drop in wrapper for sendmail
that makes PGP encryption completely transparent.  Some other tools come
with it that make decryption as transparent as it's likely to get.  You
wouldn't need root access if pine would allow the user to point pine to
something other than sendmail. 

If all else fails:
	finger slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | pgp -f > mkpgp.txt.uu
for a c-shell script that runs between pine and pgp as an alternate editor.

(I think the hundreds of finger requests slutsky gets are a clear 
indication that it's time to integrate pgp into pine.)

It's built-in to pine3.91- option 1 under MAIN SETUP PRINTER.

There is also a unix program to do it, written by Gary Day and modified by
me.  If you are interested in ansi printing, please consider giving it a try.
I would like to improve it further, and welcome comments and patches:

	I was at a new computer store this week here in Edmonton, no 
names but 
it was one of those new warehouse like computer superstores.
	
In this computer store they had a room set up for seminars and one of the 
topics was the new Edmonton FreeNet that I belong to. 
At the seminar someone asked if the program Pine scrambles a file 
attached to an Email message. No one really knew if it does this on not.  
It was one of those things that get you thinking.  If you send an Email 
message with an attached file to someone who does not have the Pine 
program will it end up distorted?  

Now I am new to the Internet and I have not had a lot of time with the 
Pine program so I do not know if it really does this.  If someone out 
there can tell me if this is true on not,
I would be most grateful to you.
 
I do not think a Pine user would like to start sending files to people 
and find out that it's not going to work. 

Please Email me or reply to this News Group.

Subject: editing MIME attachements in reply - how?
Message-Id: <CzpwIq.9u2@exodus.iti.gov.sg>
Date: Wed, 23 Nov 1994 11:13:38 GMT

Greetings,

I have been receiving SMTP mails from our VAX running TGV Multinet,
which send attachments in MIME format. When I try to reply to those mails
using Pine, the attachments disappear from the message body and I see
lines in the header's attachment entry indicating their presence. I would 
like to include and edit those attachment in the message body. Can 
someone tell me how to do that?

Thanks in advance!

Correct.  And, if userA happens to have a filter that causes the message 
to be delivered outside of the local machine without going through your 
MTA's fix-up code, the right thing happens.  If userA's mailbox happens 
to be on an IMAP server, the right thing happens.

This is an old issue (17 years and counting).  Just about everybody who 
is anybody in the field of email software design has concluded that 
unqualified addresses are A Very Bad Thing.

See above.  Only very old software depends upon MTA fixup.

Designers of modern MUAs do not write unqualified local addresses because 
they have been burnt entirely too many times.  Claims to the contrary 
notwithstanding, the problems of unqualified local addresses have NEVER 
been solved so that there is a guarantee that messages with such will not 
escape their zoos.  These problems have consumed a disproportionate 
amount of support time dealing with bug reports from (often very irate) 
users who've been screwed by this.

You have stumbled upon an internal communication mechanism between Pine
and c-client, used for an unrelated internal purpose.  It has magic
implications specifically for that purpose.  It is NOT(!!) designed or
intended to provide support for unqualified addresses in outgoing
messages. 

If it ``works'' with what you're doing, it is entirely by accident.  I
wouldn't be at all surprised if you have mysterious Pine crashes (and if
so we will definitely fix the bug that lets you do poke at it).  It 
*will* interfere with internal Pine operations, since that mechanism is 
there for a completely different purpose.

> Can I rely on this feature remaining in future versions of pine?

Absolutely not.  If you exploit a bug in Pine that lets you abuse an
internal mechanism, you are on your own.  We only support that which we 
document.

You should be able to set it to another file, even an empty one using the

If you can find the time, you really should read the online help.  It
explains that Pine uses MIME encoding with attachments, and lists some
reasons why that's a Good Thing.  If you get ambitious with your
reading program, you might get the comp.mail.mime FAQ and discover why
MIME is a Good Thing, and learn about other MIME decoders besides
Pine.

But who reads documentation anymore?

    Pine tries with rsh to exec /etc/rimapd.  Are you able to rsh other
commands from your login without getting "Permission denied", or to
rlogin without being prompted for a password?

    If not, then you need to take steps to allow rsh to succeed -- check
the man page, although the easiest way might be to create an .rhosts
file with your host and username in your home directory on the IMAP
server, or an /etc/hosts.equiv to permit access for many users in a
distributed environment.

Who is currently maintaining pine port to vms ?
There appear to be a few things wrong with 3.90-vms.b1 but I could't
find an address in the source/docs
help says that vms bugs should be sent to authors directly.
Do I post here..?

My notes are scratch$disk:[local.pine]readme.div on
sotona.phys.soton.ac.uk if anyone wants them

- where can I get (stable ?) 3.89 for vms - I hear it is tied in some way to
a commercial package..?

thanks

In page 35 of my "Pine Technical Notes" (Version 3.91) they promise that

    "Unix Pine also understands message folders in other formats, such
    as ..., MH, ..."
            ^^
But how can you do this?  I could not find any further hint.
My folders are created by xmh, but that should be the same.

If pine itself cannot read MH/xmh folders, is there any utility that can
convert MH/xmh messages to pine files?

Preferably, pine should be able to _use_ MH/xmh folders, so pine and xmh
could be used together.  But this is not in the cards, I presume? :-(

In our final days of testing Pine 3.91 before making it public (here at U 
of Arkansas), we have found what seems to be a small problem. When an 
inbox is corrupted, Pine 3.89 notified the user that the inbox is 
corrupt.  Pine 3.91 does not seem to notify the user.  Instead, it opens 
the inbox and reports 0 messages.  It doesn't seem to tell the end user 
that there is a problem. Any suggestions on how to prevent this?

Solaris 2.3 (I think)


Thanks in advance,

Pine can (I and others use the MH-folder format with Pine for some time 
now).

Some excerpts from my .pinerc:

# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).
inbox-path=#mh/inbox

(Note that you can also use inbox-path=#MHINBOX)

# List of directories where saved-message folders may be. First one is
# the default for Saves. Example: Main {host1}mail/[], Desktop mail\[]
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}optnl-directory-path[]
folder-collections="My Mail" #mh/[]

There is this small bug (which will be fixed in 3.91) in the MH-driver 
that might affect you. If you have your MH-folders somewhere else then in 
~/Mail try moving the Path: setting in ~/.mh_profile to the first line in 
the file.

Xander

I had problems myself with this feature.  Here is what I found.

Pine appends the value of the <Path:> statement in .mh_profile to your 
$HOME directory name.  This will be the path where Pine will look for mh 
folders.  For example, if your <Path:> in .mh_profile is:
Path: mh-folders
and you <Go> #MH/project, Pine will look for the directory 
$HOME/mh-folders/project
By the same token, #MH/[] will refer to the collection of folders found 
in $HOME/mh-folders.

This might fit your case.

Pine developers: why do you put the "sv4" stuff in with the
non-ANSI group? Is there some variant of SVR4 that is not
ANSI-compatible? Eg., to get pine to build under UnixWare
(SVR4.x), I have to move the sv4.* files from the non-ANSI
directory to the ANSI directory, and edit a couple of makefiles
to activate "-DANSI".

Surely you could handle that easily enough in your
distribution???

Thanks,
Pete

Message-Id: <Pine.PTX.3.91.941128143838.21941A-100000@lancelot.aps.org>

Hi,

Using Pine 3.91 and loving it... We have a couple of folks here using 
Wyse 60 terminals, connected to an Annex terminal server which is in turn 
connected to our Sequent system running Dynix/ptx. When they go into 
Pine, they have screen display problems, i.e. "ghost" images of the 
prompts appear to the right of the From: and To" fields after information 
is entered. In addition, they cannot use their arrow keys; they are 
recognized as control character sequences. I realize this is probably a 
setup problem in terminfo or our terminal server; but I would appreciate 
it if someone with a similar environment can lend a hand.

Since I have no direct Usenet access, I would appreciate if you could 
reply to me directly.

Thanks, and keep up the good work!

With the new release of OS/2 Warp (3.0), there is (or will be) a significant 
demand for a product such as pine for OS/2.  More and more people will be 
switching to OS/2 in the future, and the only mailers currently available for 
OS/2 are clearly inadequate.  

Please, please please!

I realize Eudora always uses MIME for identifying message parts -- Pine
does always identify a binhexed attachment as such -- but it doesn't
always use BASE64 for encoding binary data, which is what I tried to say.
I made the mistake of using "MIME" instead of "Base64" in my last
sentence.  Let me rephrase: "the default ought to be Base64 for
outgoing attachments, using AppleDouble to isolate Mac-specific data."

Granted, I'm a loon, I can find several to attest, I'm sure :-)  But
please explain why Eudora *should* allow Binhex for outgoing messages.  
Doesn't AppleDouble+Base64 work just as well?  If not, then let's toss
it and define something else that does, but uses Base64 encoding of
binary parts.

Well, there must be a bug in 1.4.3 Eudora, because I did several
experiments sending Excel and Word documents and always, if I left
"send as Mac documents" unchecked (but AppleDouble was selected instead
of binhex), the document was sent using binhex instead of appledouble+
base64.  Of course, peering closer, I see that the AppleDouble vs
Binhex selections are *indented* under the "always as mac docs" box, so
I suppose if the box isn't checked, the setting below isn't used.  At
the least, that needs to be clearer to lightheaded users (myself
included :-)

[I finally checked out 1.5.1b3 - very impressive.  The new settings 
 dialog is very nice, and yes, it sent using the proper encoding, 
 regardless of "include Mac info" setting.]

I guess I'm trying to say that a) for most users, "MIME" means "base64
for binary parts" (whether they're aware of base64 or not -- they just
know that another MIME mailer ought to be able to read the attachment),
b) most users don't know what appledouble is either, so the attachment
configuration dialog is confusing (and binhex is familiar, so they pick
that), and c) most users won't ever bother with the mapping resources,
but still expect their documents to be sent using AppleDouble when they
select that.

Again, in the PC version, "MIME" seems to imply "base64" instead of
binhex.  I was just suggesting a simplification of the dialog,
substituting "MIME" for "AppleDouble" so that users would be more
likely to use that when sending to non-Eudora or unknown-MUA users, to
enhance the probability that their document will be usable at the other
end.

As for type information, where there isn't already an "application/xxx"
type, how about including the info in the Content-Description (i.e
"Macintosh Excel Document")?  Mac mailers could just dip into the other
AppleDouble parts, of course, but I don't think non-Mac MUAs should be
responsible for doing that.  Most people are going to tell you what
type of document they're sending in the body anyway, so just being able
to save off the data portion easily will go a long way toward better
interoperability.  It may be that major Mac and/or quasi cross-platform
types (i.e most Microsoft ones :-) should indeed be registered as Media
Types.

Yes, I agree, Eudora is very MIME compliant.  I'm just saying it should
prefer using AppleDouble over Binhex.  When users send a binhexed
document to a user running a different MIME MUA, or using a MIME
gateway, they typically can't use the document without hassle, at least
on PCs.  If the senders use AppleDouble, the data portion is much more
readily accessible, thus the user sees MIME as a useful thing, and will
push for its use.  If not, they look at how easy their proprietary mail
system (ccMail, MSMAIL, etc) handles attachments, and think "I don't
need MIME, look how well this works".  *That's* what hinders MIME
acceptance.

If every MIME program is required to support Application/Binhex in
order to exchange documents, and parse out the pieces if they want to
display the type, then the purposes and potential of MIME are
circumvented, IMHO.

Hello.

Thank you for reporting this problem.  At first, I was confused by your
report, but now I understand: if you open INBOX and the /usr/spool/mail/$USER
file is corrupted, you will get this behavior.  Opening the file explicitly
will give you the error.

I'll look into having this bug fixed in Pine 3.92.

MIDnet now provides "IMAP" access to all contributions mailed to the
net-happenings mailing list.   This means if you have a mail client that
is imap-compliant (i.e., pine), you may read the latest articles off
MIDnet's IMAP server.  By offering this kind of access, you don't have to
subscribe to net-happenings yourself, just rely on MIDnet to provide you
the articles.  The format for accessing an IMAP server is:

	*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/yy-mm-dd

where you replace yy with "94", mm with "11", "10", etc and dd with "01",
"11", etc.

For example, after you press "g" in pine (for the "go-to" command), you 
would enter the above string like this:

	*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/94-11-21

If you have comments or suggestions on how this service might be improved,
send mail to nic@mid.net.

I have been practicing transferring binary files (Word and Word Perfect

doing wrong.

I upload the file, attach it, send it,  receive it, use view attachment in 
Pine, save to file, download and then try to open it.


I have tried to use Pine help but I can't seem to get things working. I assume 
it is something simple

Try the finger(1) command.  Some versions of sendmail support delivery

of privacy); I don't know if stock AIX sendmail does.  Read
notification is a another matter.

You could encrypt your message outside of Pine and insert it in the

PGP with Pine in the near future.

I have just installed Pine on an RS6000 running AIX 3.2.4.   
I have a query or two that I hoped someone may be able to answer:

I downloaded a file called technotes.txt or something similar.  I want to edit it on my 
PC but the problem is that it has hard returns at the end of every line and 
also there are square boxes between characters of words that appear to have 
been underlined.  Did I get the wrong file, or do something wrong?

Also can you advise whether Pine 3.91 supports the following features:
I couldnt find any reference to them but I thought I should check in case I 
overlooked something obvious:

1. Auto-forwarding (user set, such as when on holiday)
2. Auto-reply (adivsing of a situation, such as above)

I doubt that there will be a flud of DOS, Windows or whatever users 
switching to OS/2.
OS/2 has its limitations and there isn't enough support for it out there.
Besides, I believe you can use PC-Pine in a DOS box too.
Maybe ask IBM. Their address for OS/2 is OS2WARP@vnet.ibm.com

Hear, hear!

My users are clamoring for PGP and they simply do *not* want to learn 
some other alternate-editor interface.  They want, as one user said to 
me, "Pine to work like Pine", when I tried to give her a PGP script.

It was Zimmerman's idea that we learn to use public-key encryption for 
virtually *all* email.  A Pine with PGP integrated would facilitate this.

Well, the place I used to have it evaporated, so I've just uploaded it to 
another archive for SCO software, odi.cwc.whecn.edu.  Anonymous FTP 
there.  Currently, the package (named pine3.91.sco.bins.tar.gz) rests in 
/pub/in-coming, but will get moved before long to something under 
/pub/sco-ports.  If you have the development kit (including the 
developer's version of TCP/IP), you can compile it yourself without any 
troubles.  I'm also going to upload it to ftp.celestial.com, as soon as I 
can figure out where.

These are not quite the same!

The difference between #mh/inbox and #MHINBOX is that the latter will 
move mail from /usr/spool/mail/$USER into your MH inbox.  The former just 
opens the MH inbox without this behavior.

The answer to this question is "yes"; there are SVR4 systems that do not
have C compilers which support ANSI prototypes.  A port is necessarily
limited by the worst representative of that port.

There is absolutely no reason why it should matter whether or not the sv4
files are in .../imap/ANSI/c-client or .../imap/non-ANSI/c-client. The
only difference between the .../imap/ANSI and ../imap/non-ANSI trees is in
the C function prototyping and function headers.  The object files
generated are identical.  The existance of the ANSI tree is only to help
me in software development.  I'm seriously considering releasing only the
non-ANSI tree, which was done in earlier versions of Pine, to put an end
to these debates. 

Any problems you may have in building Pine under UnixWare are completely
independent of which tree the c-client sources are in.  I'm willing to
help out on figuring out what the problems you may be having, or even to
build a new UnixWare port if it is necessary to make it plug&play for
UnixWare.

But please, let's all accept that: the SV4 port is non-ANSI for a reason,
it is not to insult your C compiler, it doesn't make any difference in the
resulting binaries, and the resulting binaries are all that counts!! ;-)

   A question for the experts.

   Pine has an annoying habit of being smart.  It stamps each letter with
the persons name and machine before mailing, instead of letting sendmail
take care of it.

   We use First.Last aliases in addition to the standard passwd entry for
addressing mail.  Our problem is that pine stamps mail with the passwd
login, instead of leaving sendmail to put the needed First.Last name in
the From line. We need to compile pine so it _does_not_ expand the senders
name and instead leaves it to sendmail.

   Send suggestions directly to me, you pine gurus you.

PS- We have a sendmail hack that will force pine to comply, but we would
    prefer modifying pine instead.

The bug of not getting notified about corrupted /usr/spool/mail/$USER files

dummy_open() in file c-client/dummy.c with the following code:

{
  int fd;
  char err[MAILTMPLEN],tmp[MAILTMPLEN];
  struct stat sbuf;
				/* OP_PROTOTYPE call */
  if (!stream) return &dummyproto;
  err[0] = '\0';		/* no error message yet */
				/* can we open the file? */
  if ((fd = open (dummy_file (tmp,stream->mailbox),O_RDONLY,NIL)) < 0) {
				/* no, error unless INBOX */
    if (strcmp (ucase (strcpy (tmp,stream->mailbox)),"INBOX"))
      sprintf (err,"%s: %s",strerror (errno),stream->mailbox);
  }
  else {			/* file had better be empty then */
    fstat (fd,&sbuf);		/* sniff at its size */
    close (fd);
    if (sbuf.st_size)		/* bogus format if non-empty */
      sprintf (err,"%s (file %s) is not in valid mailbox format",
	       stream->mailbox,tmp);
  }
  if (!stream->silent) {	/* only if silence not requested */
    if (err[0]) mm_log (err,ERROR);
    else {
      mail_exists (stream,0);	/* say there are 0 messages */
      mail_recent (stream,0);	/* and certainly no recent ones! */
    }
  }
  return err[0] ? NIL : stream;	/* return success if no error */
}

Subject: PC-Pine creates wrong mail-folders!?
Date: 29 Nov 1994 12:55:14 GMT
Message-Id: <3bf8bi$8nr@surz03.HRZ.Uni-Marburg.DE>

When saving mail to a new folder, a file is created in ~/Mail but afterwards
pine complains about wrong file format (or something like that).

Looking into the mail directory shows a new file *without*any* permissions!
After changing the permission to rw for user, mail can be saved by PC-Pine
without Problems.

Does anyone knows the problem and a solution ?
Is it a Pine or a imap fault or ... ?

Thanks in advance

Is there a way to select (tag) multiple newsgroups at once in Pine?  This 
one at a time deal is terrible.

Should this be added to the Pine.#.## wish list?

PGPsendmail won't work with all mailers (yet).  In particular, it won't work 
with NeXT's Mail.app or NeXT's /usr/ucb/mail.  It seems to work fine 
with Pine on a NeXT however.  (NeXT seems to use undocumented args to 
sendmail...  Mail.app also presents other problems which are addressed by 
CryptorBundle.)

In any case, I don't think users should be required to depend on the
system administrator to install PGPsendmail (or support pgp for that
matter...  that's why I work on mkpgp, so users can take care of it
themselves...).  PGPsendmail can be installed by the user.  If users could
point Pine to it, the PGP issue would *go*away*.

I don't know how much effort would be involved in such a modification, 
but intuition tells me it would be far less than that required to actually 
integrate pgp into Pine.

I am experiencing a problem using the bounce command.  This used to work 
for me.  Further, it works fine for someone else here.  After doing as 
much detective work as I could I found the problem to be that pine is 
composing the pinesend tmp file as follows:

The first line appears to be the problem.  The problem shows itself as a 
"possible alias loop" error (see example below).  So what is adding 
this?  When another user does this same command on this same message this 
does not happen (that first line is not there).  Could it be something in 
my config?  If I just do a normal send this does not happen either.

Thanks,

OK.  How does your doubt in any way relate to Chuck's posting other

You could at least append an IMAO to this.  Just what are those limitations
and what do you mean by "isn't enough support"?

Why should he limit himself?  Just to conform to your attitudes?

Your sole suggestion is "Ask IBM because I don't know anything about it?"

Why did you respond to this post, Dieter, since you had nothing of
value to add?  One might think you were trolling, since you spend an
awful lot of time making insubstantial allegations against OS/2?

Were you trolling?

If I were Chuck, I might ask the PINE authors if they've had any experience
using one of the several versions of PINE with IBM's TCP/IP for DOS.  None
of them are explicitly listed as such.  I also have not explored the DOS
Box interface enough to know if it conforms to something standard like
the pktdvr interface, but I suspect it might not.

	You mean you've read all of the extensive on-line help and you
still need an FAQ?  :-) :-)  (Hope you don't need a "smiley" FAQ.)

	The FAQ can be found at:

	There is also a Web URL for the document....but I don't have

Back just before the release of Pine 3.90, Farzad Farid and I were working on
porting Pine to OS/2, console mode.  Actually, he ported 3.89 to OS/2, and
I got the newer C-client library working (including mtest).  We never did
get together & get 3.90 (or 3.91) working under OS/2, but I haven't heard
from him in a while.  Perhaps he's been busy...?

You can also specify a folder-collection of

	*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/[]

to get the entire archive in a collection.  That way you can browse much more
easily.

Note that this syntax is specific to c-client based packages like Pine and
may be different on other IMAP clients.  The syntax will also change in a
future version of c-client/Pine...

Are you *sure* that you had /anonymous in the folder collection?  rsh 
access is supposed to be disabled when /anonymous is used.  If it still 
tried rsh in spite of /anonymous, this is a bug (and please report it to 
pine-bugs).

The ":143" *is* the option to disable rsh!  Yeah, I know, we need a 
somewhat more intuitive interface...  ;-)

	Maybe Pine looks at the value of umask...? You could try (from UNIX): 

umask 0077

Which will set the permissions of any new file created to rw for user.

There is a known bug in c-client last spring that caused this, that may 
be in your imapd.  Try updating from the version in Pine 3.91.

Hello.

Does pine yet support mh-style folders for mail storage? ie. can a
folder be a directory off ~/mail and each message be an individual
file within, as opposed to all glommed together?

thanks,

Hi there:

Is that possible to use arrow keys to control pine just like in gopher?  
It would be very convenient to use arrow keys to go into and leave index and

Thanks!!

Subject: Alternate msg viewer
Date: 30 Nov 1994 01:15:32 GMT
Message-Id: <3bgjnk$nu9@nuhou.aloha.net>

I'm attempting to use an alternate message viewer with PINE.

I wrote a simple perl program that takes a msg on 
stdin and encodes any URL's it finds into HTML and
fires up LYNX on the resulting file.

I tried launching this using both the PINE | command and
the PINE user defined printer.  Both of them seem to take
the output of lynx and show it with the built-in PINE viewer.
Is there some way to set it up so lynx actually gets control
of the screen?

Here is the program I was used:

#!/usr/bin/perl
$out_file = "jview_tmp.html";

open (JV, ">$out_file");

print JV "<html><body></pre>\n"; 

while (<>) {
	chop if m/\n$/;
	s/(http:\S+)/<a href=\"\1\">\1<\/a>/;
	s/(ftp:\S+)/<a href=\"\1\">\1<\/a>/;
	print JV $_, "\n";
}

print JV "</pre></body></html>\n"; 
close JV;

system ("lynx $out_file");

I am now working on porting the 3,91 version. The other ported version is 3.89;
the 3.90 is "half baked" and will be removed as soon as I have the 3.91
working.
Please direct the comments directly to me.

There is also a commercial port of it by the Innosoft people.

I was unable to get Pine (3.91 + patch to bezerk.c on NeXT 3.0) to open this.
I believe that the forked rsh process is hanging.  However, if I use:

*{imap.mid.net:143/anonymous}pub/NET/[]

it works just spiffily.  Would it be possible to put in an option to disable
rsh imap login for those of us with a brain-dead rsh that hangs?

When I save a mail message to a file, pine (3.91) forces me to
use an absolute pathname instead of $HOME/something or
~/something. Did I overlook a configurable parameteror is this
pine's behavior?

Also, it owuld be nice if pine cached the folder list, as it
seems to take her as long time to reread and redisplay it.

Because that's what a large percentage of the pre-MIME installed base is
using.  I can't ignore the need to send data to all those users.

There is also the fact that BinHex's checksum is much more convenient to
compute than content-md5, and we do have quite a few users running over
non-guaranteed-clean channels.  Sure wish there were a way to put the MD5
at the END of the body part rather than the beginning.

Well, I dunno what to say.  That's certainly not what MY copy of 1.4.3
does.  I tested it then, and I retested it just now.

You can get Base64 with BinHex selected (if you set the mapping tables up
that way), but nothing will induce Eudora to use BinHex if you have
AppleDouble selected.  Except, evidently, space aliens in Texas. :-)

Like I said, it does.

The RFC reads to me like Content-Description is supposed to be about the
content, rather than the type, of the body part.  I think such usage would
be unconventional at best.

Someday it will.  Perhaps even soon.  Currently, we're too concerned about
compatibility with non-MIME mailers to make the switch.

Message-Id: <0098836F.B3921424@sacto.mp.usbr.gov>

	I've had a question from one of our users concerning finding
out what new netnews groups are available.  From looking at the 
documentation, it appears that Pine can be made to access the 
/usr/lib/news/active file to get the information concerning newgroups.  
However, in our case, the client and server are on different machines.  
Is there a way to set this up?  We are running Pine 3.91 and INN 1.4.

While we're discussing this, how about being able to use the Page-Up and
Page-Down keys?  Or having the Delete key be different from the Backspace
key in Pico?  I like the paragraph formatting feature of Pico, but I don't
like moving the cursor after a character so I can delete it.

I'm using a pre-compiled version of Pine on SCO Unix 3.2v4.2, so I don't
know if this is a pre- or post-compile configuration option.  I've looked
around for documentation on this but haven't found anything.

Note that Windows Pine is labeled PC-Pine for Windows3.1/Winsock.  This
means that it would work with any Winsock compliant TCP/IP stack.  There
are numerous Winsock implementations that supports both LAN and serial
(SLIP/PPP) connections.  Among all of these, the famous Trumpet WINSOCK.  
And PC-Pine-W works perfectly on it without any special setting for 
beeing over a serial connection.

As usual, there is no magic.

I'd be very interested in hearing if this actually fixes the problem. We have
noticed the exact same symptoms here on one of our BSDI systems. The problem 
only occurs from certain Macintosh clients. However, those same clients can
connect to other systems with no problems, and other machines can connect to
our BSDI system and run pine (and pico) with no problems. Perhaps someone
(Mark?) could explain just exactly what it is that is broken in the NeXT
telnetd and whether the problem has also been seen elesewhere. I looked at 
file Mark mentions above, however it does not include any explanation or
source code or I might try to compile it here. If anyone has any insights as
to what is going on, I would be very appreciative.

I have resolved this problem.  Pine was not adding the line above.  
Procmail was adding it to all incoming mail and when I bounced using Pine 
it simply retained it.  Sorry for the false alarm.

Sure, it works pretty well.  I've run both Windows Pine and regular UNIX Pine
with IMAP over a SLIP link, and even do proxy IMAP over two SLIP links at
once. (Proxy is something like {java.island-resort.com}{csgrad.cs.vt.edu}inbox )

I've found Windows Pine to be slow to read mail in some cases because it
doesn't build the full cache that Unix Pine does.  Sorting large mailboxes is
almost out of the question with Windows Pine, but it's fine with UNIX Pine. 
I know it's impossible to increase the cache for DOS, but it would be a big
improvement for Windows.  Heck my copy of Frame maker pages continuously even
if it's the only thing running in 8Mb, so their precidence for using vast
amounts of memory.  Composing with windows Pine is quite different.  It's
extremely snappy!

Pine is getting control-j when you press return.  We have the same
thing on Mac NCSA Telnet connecting to SunOS hosts.  It appears to be
something in our terminal servers or SunOS; Mark Crispin tells me it's
probably the SunOS telnetd.  

We modified pine so ^J is the same as ^M and other control letters do
what ^J does in standard pine.  Last time I mentioned this, the pine
folks didn't want the mods and just told us to change telnetd.

Control-j does mean newline in every other context I can think of.

 Here I am, back from my trainship at IBM Research :)
I've got a working port of Pine 3.89 under OS/2, I've used it without
any loss of mail for a few months. But the port is not very clean
though and imap has not been tested at all.
 Unfortunately I don't run OS/2 anymore for the moment and I have no
time yet to work on another port. I've got an archive of my pine
sources archived in a zip file I can't even read (HPFS needed). If
anyone wants it, just email me and I'll make it available by FTP.

Message-Id: <3bhnp9$cbt@rowan.coventry.ac.uk>


Hi,
	has anyone out there done any work on producing a 'secure' pine. I 
	am currently doing so and have had some success. Amongst the things
	I want to prevent are.

	1. Saving messages into folders outside of ~/mail (done)
	2. Piping/Suspending not allowed (done).
	3. Stop the file lister allowing you to leave your home directory
	   by utilising ".." (not done).


	It's the last one that I'm having most problems with as I'm not sure
	exactly what I should be modifying. 

	Can anyone out there advise on how I might acheive this kind of
	functionality with the viewer.	I need to be able to stop them leaving
	their $HOME for either ^R -read file or when adding attachments.


	Any help appreciated.....

	If there is enough interest I can summarise replies to the group.

	cheers.

HELP!

Everything was working fine, and then suddenly I start getting the 
following errors (as do my users):

                 [Writing Fcc...]rdlankes... Possible alias loop

Note, I wasn't sending mail to myself, nor is there an alias for rdlankes 
in /etc/aliases or in my addressbook.

I then get a Mail Delivery Subsystem error saying I didn't have any valid 
recipients. This happens both in 3.91 and 3.90

If it's a sendmail problem I can't find it.

It appears that setting a value for SMTP in the Configurations menu fixes 
the problem...don't know why.

Try giving the following command at your UNIX prompt:

Um, what compiler were you using?  I use C/Set++, and wouldn't want
to continue this if it meant working with emx/gcc -- not that I have
anything against emx, it's just that I don't have enough diskspace
to keep two compilers around.

Other than that, I'd be interested in trying to fit the changes you
made to 3.89 to 3.91 and generally bringing OS/2 support up to date
(and maybe even into the realm of "supported platform").

However, I have a sinking feeling that it'd require emx...

Greetings,

For work on my MS thesis I'm adding features for dealing with large amounts
of e-mail to Pine.  I'm trying some new and unconventional design
methodologies (scenario-based design) and would like to solicit your help a
bit if I may.  I'm looking for input from general e-mail users, designers and
experts.  Hopefully a working result will be publically available when I'm
all done. 

I'm going about this by collecting real life narratives or stories to
better understand the situations people are in, and in order to getter
a better understanding of the users goals, their constraints and their
context.  These stories will be the starting points of the design.
I'll modify the stories or create new ones to reflect use of new
features in the system I design, so I'm effectively designing the
interaction scenario instead of just the program.

Here's what I'm looking for in terms of contributions.  In particular I'd 
like to hear about experiences with the ";" or "Select" command in Pine, 
but am interested in hearing about other mailers too.

    * Describe an actual situation that happened or is happening
    * Write in the first person
    * It's OK to ramble
    * If you want include social/workplace context, computer system constraints
    * Include suggestions if you have some
    * Example:
	 "I always like to respond to my best client's e-mail as quickly
	  as possible, but I didn't always notive their messages among
	  my other e-mail. I finally figured out how to show messages from
	  their addresses in red.  This was hard to figure out in this mail
	  program. (It's called "Planet-mail")."


Send the story, suggestions, discussion, narrative, etc to me at:
    lgl@csgrad.cs.vt.edu

You can also use the input form on my web home page:
    http://oneworld.wa.com/laurence/xscenario.html

There's bit more info on scenario based design and the scenarios I've 
collected so far on the Web page too.

Thanks very much!

Hi,

I wonder if it is possible to define a dos batch file for PCPINE to print
rather than sending the output to the local printer. I would like to use
the lpr print command through the dos batch instead!

Regards,

Wai-Ming Tai.

Hi, 

As root, I would like to set the printer variable in the general
configuration file (which is /usr/local/lib/pine.conf for me) to be
'lp' instead of 'lpr' (I am on SGI, System V). If I modify a variable
in the pine.conf, the users see the changes if they haven't change
themselves this variable in their .pinerc. However, the change of
'printer' in pine.conf is not seen by users. Any idea about this
problem ?

Thanks in advance.		Gildas.

I'd call it a terminal emulation problem, after a fashion.  In my 
experience, few VT-xxx emulators handle the cursor kepys (including home, 
pgup, pgdn) consistently or accurately.  So it's hard for a program to 
try to cover all the bases.  Most therefore don't try.  However, if you 
can re-map your keyboard, ^D is "delete-next-character" in Pine; ^Y is 
PgUp and ^V is PgDn.  With access to the source, you could certainly 
remap them yourself in the code.

Here is a script that creates an mbox from an mh folder.  It works on my
