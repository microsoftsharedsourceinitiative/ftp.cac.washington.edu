I am using PINE 3.89 in Linux system.
Pine encodes sending mail automatically depending on
its text content.

I use 8 bit text (Korean Hangul) for sending mail and
since it's full 8 bit, pine encodes it to BASE64.
If english content is larger than hangul, it encodes to QUOTED-PRINTABLE.

I don't want hangul TEXT mail encoded neither BASE64 nor QUOTED-PRINTABLE
when sending my mail, because most of others in my country
doesn't recognize these format.

So, I want to disable this coding system in pine.
Or force conding to 8 Bit.
Is there any solution?

When you hit space when reading a message in PINE, it gives you the next
screenful.  However the last two lines of the previous screen become the
first two lines of the new screen.  I know most people like this effect
because it lends to continuity, but it drives me crazy.  I invariably
start reading the first line expecting to be getting new information.  I
don't care for the "deja vu all over again" effect.

Is there a setting for this in 3.91?  I couldn't find one.  I'm not keen
on recompiling it for this one nit.

We have been having wierd STMP problems with our system (Papaya went on 
vacation -- don't ask!) and managed to go from Turkey Day through 
yesterday with about a 20% mail loss. 

This is not due to Pine (ooh, gotta love it!) but something else. Pine 
saves to sent-mail or wherever and then...IT DISSAPPEARS.

My SysAdmin mentioned that he found a line that you can add to the header 
(user-definable header) that will send a 'Letter Read Receipt' to the 
sender. He blieved that this was recognized by all but SUN/Solaris (ICK!) 
systems. (Hey, we've got BSD, change a letter and you've got....Kind-a 
makes it fun) IF we were ablt to put this in our headers (not 
everyone's...really just mine) we could keep tabs on what is going out 
and what isn't and try to find the problem (which we haven't)

If anyone knows the syntax for this please let me/us know.

Please help and excuse my annoying nature. I spend too much time in front 
of the computer and don't get to talk to enough real people!

Thank you in advance,

Nick

Several years ago, a buggy version of the telnet daemon was released on 
BSD systems.  NeXT systems are distributed with version 5.45 of 6/28/90 
which is one of the buggy versions.  By version 5.48 of 3/1/91, this bug 
was fixed.

The bug is that the broken telnetd version converts the Internet newline
sequence CR LF into LF, apparently in a misguided notion of converting it
to UNIX newline.

Because of this UNIX telnetd bug, many Telnet clients do not send Internet
newlines.  They send CR NUL, which is the Telnet protocol command to send
a raw CR.  Other Telnet clients, such as the Mac ones you mention, follow
the spec and send Internet newlines when the user hits return. 

It must be emphasized that there is nothing wrong with the Mac clients; 
they are doing the right thing and it is the UNIX servers that are broken. 
Furthermore, this bug was fixed years ago, so it is only the extreme 
laziness of vendors such as NeXT that this bug still persists.  If your 
UNIX system still has this bug, you might want to ask its vendor what 
other bugs you have due to their callousness.

The telnetd binary that I distribute on the ftp.cac.washington.edu server
comes from netbsd sources on CD-ROM.  The only change which I made to the
source was to insert a workaround to the process group handling, necessary
because NeXT broke the tty driver in 3.1 (still broken in 3.2). 

My recommendation to fix your BSDI system is to get any of the UNIX
CD-ROMs with telnetd sources, and build your own copy of a modern telnetd.

There is no "standard" for either a "delivery receipt" or "read receipt".

Many a sendmail implementation will process the:

Return-Receipt-To:

head which can be thought of as a "delivery receipt"  But you can't
trust that will work all of the time.  The idea of a "delivery receipt"
needs to be implemented on the MTA level since it is the MTA that is
responsible for delivery.

Once a mail is delivered it is the task of the User Agent (UA) to present
the contents of the mail to you.  Thus, if a "read" receipt were to be
implemented it would need to be implemented at the UA level since only
the UA would have a reasonable chance to determine if the letter was
opened.  (Please note that *no* UA or any software can determine if the
letter has been "read".)  Some UAs do implement a "read" receipt.
However, the scheme only works when individuals are using the UA at
both ends.  Even then, some vendors change the way they implement the
feature between versions!  Bottom line....forget "read" receipts.

Why is it that this shows up in my folder list as a "News-collection," i.e.:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
News-collection <News on imap.mid.net>                              (Remote)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Why isn't it a "Folder-collection"?


Also, this particular mailing list is linked to the newsgroup
comp.internet.net-happenings, so if you have access to newsgroups
then you may prefer to read this as a newsgroup.  Does anyone
know if the link between the net-happenings mailing list and 
newsgroup is bidirectional?

Thanks,
Nancy

First export the message and edit it so that the first line
looks like this (it might say a different version):

%!PS-Adobe-1.0


Then, at your unix prompt type:

  ansiprt < filename.ps

Or, if that doesn't work and ansiprint is installed, try this:

  ansiprint filename.ps

And if that doesn't work try a different comm program.  On my
system, the above two work when I'm using DOS Kermit but don't
work when I use Delrina's WinComm (but if anyone knows how to
get them to work with WinComm I'd love to know!).

If you still can't print a postscript file directly from your
Unix account you can download them to your PC (if you have a
PC) and then use either of the following to print the postscript
file:

  copy filename.ps lpt1

  type filename.ps > lpt1

Or open filename.ps up inside of DOS Edit and choose Print from
the File menu.


I hope one of these works for you.
Postscript printers are great!

 Yes right :) I used emx/gcc because it's the best compiler for
porting quickly a unix application. And that's exactly what I did
without having to modify a lot of code.
 If you want to have a look a the code ask Don Loflin
<loflin@mail.utexas.edu>, I gave him the sources. Maybe you can ftp
them there as I cannot set an FTP server myself my machine is too
unstable.

Subject: Macros for ';' multiple-select (request)
Date: 1 Dec 1994 12:07:44 -0600
Message-Id: <3bl3dg$cfm@sirius.cc.utexas.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 


I love the newly-implented ';' select mode in Pine 3.9x.  It's made
dealing with mailing-list email tractable finally.  But I keep wishing
there was some way for Pine to 'remember' the multiple select commands
I have to enter to isolate the messages of a particular mailing list.

For instance, I'm on the 'tcp-group' mailing list, which has reasonably
high traffic at times.  But some messages are sent to the list using
To:, some using Cc:.  So to select them all, I have to hit '; T T
tcp-group <CR>' and then '; B T C tcp-group <CR>'.  That's a lot of
keystrokes.  And I have to enter them at least every time I run Pine.
And I'm on quite a few mailing lists, not just that one.

My request is for a 'macro' capability, whereby I could hit say, '#'
and a macro-name (i.e using ^T to browse and so on), which would
execute the select commands.  For that matter, this might as well be a
general macro facility for any commands - then I could write one to not
only select the messages, but save them and expunge them.  Gosh, that
sounds like mail filtering!  For the (hopefully small) price of adding
macros.  

Some of you will say "just use procmail".  I can't.  My mail server
doesn't let me log in interactively - I can only access it via IMAP or
POP3 (and I like it that way!).  Besides, I like seeing *all* messages
in one place, in case there's someting recent that catches my eye,

I found this quote in the Pine tech-notes:

   By popular demand of  system  administrators,  PC-
          Pine has been modified to prevent sending messages
          until the user  has  successfully  logged  into  a
          remote  mail  server.


That's all good and well, but I think the implementation of this
in PC-Pine 3.91 needs to be changed.  It won't even allow you to 
*compose* a message unless you've got a folder open!  That's a big
problem if you're using Pine on a laptop outdoors and don't happen
to have a wireless modem..

I agree with disallowing the sending of messages without a remote
folder open in PC-Pine.  However, PC-Pine has the potential for basic
disconnected operation by simply allowing Composing and Postponing (to
a local folder) of messages when no connection is up.  What I really
want to be able to do is download a mail folder (or even just several
messages) to my palmtop and then take it elsewhere (without a modem) to
compose replies to the messages.  When I'm ready to send, I'll plug it
into a modem or even LAN card and punch ^X.

Can the Pine developers point me to the right place in the source code
to re-allow composing w/o a connection?  For now, I'll settle for
"allowing sending" without a remote folder open; I'm pretty sure I'm
not going to try to forge email, but I'm impatient to sit in park to
write email :-)

	I've not given it a try, (I use procmail.. :-) :-) ) , I wonder
if the "pine -I" would be of value?  You could make up a series of
alias commands (i.e. pine.tcp) that would alias to the appropriate
"pine -I" command that would perform the keystrokes necessary to perform
the functions that your describe.  I realize it is a bit "clunky" and
your suggestion is better...but in the mean time.....

Exactly the same file works fine with metamail. I have set

Pine resolutely ignores all my mailcap entries in versions
3.90 and 3.91 under Solaris 2.3 and in WIN-OS/2.

Clearly I am doing something fundamentally wrong, but I

We jusk got PINE on our system and i'd like to use it as a replacement
for the Unix mail command but I'm having a problem sending mail to
other local users.  We have a network of 6 Sun Sparcs, one of them
acting as a mail server to the others.  When I try and send email
to a local user the PINE program appends the hostname to the mail so
that email to 'kreuzrsk' becomes 'kreuzrsk@gandalf'.  This always
bounces back!  Email send to the user at the domainname works with
PINE.  

Any ideas?  Mail comes back with an error 554 whatever that is.  At
least with the Unix mail command I can sned local mail even if I can't
stand it for reading email.

I'm no longer at this internet address so please send suggestions to
kreuzrsk@dfw.wa.gov  thanks.

I have a look-a-like problem (on SunOS.4.1.1). Introducing 'bugs-fullname'
and 'bugs-address' in pine.conf and/or pine.conf.fixed has no effect.

In order for the postscript file to be printed on your postscript
printer the first line needs to start with something like this (it 
might say a different version):

%!PS-Adobe-1.0

Note that after this there will be lots of other postscript code too.
So you need to remove the headers and any blank lines and non-postscript 
text before sending it to your printer.  There are a number of ways to do 
this.

An elegant solution is to type V to view attachments and then type the 
pipe character followed by "ansiprt" (or a similar command like "lpansi"
or "ansiprint").

The brute force way is to first export (E) the message and then edit out 
the headers and any non-postscript text, and then send it to your printer
using one of the following.

At your unix prompt type:

  ansiprt < filename.ps

Or, if that doesn't work and ansiprint is installed, try this:

  ansiprint filename.ps

And if that doesn't work try a different comm program.  On my
system, the above two work when I'm using DOS Kermit but don't
work when I use Delrina's WinComm (but if anyone knows how to
get them to work with WinComm I'd love to know!).

If you still can't print a postscript file directly from your
Unix account you can download them to your PC (if you have a
PC) and then use either of the following to print the postscript
file:

  copy filename.ps lpt1

  type filename.ps > lpt1

Or open filename.ps up inside of DOS Edit and choose Print from
the File menu.


I hope one of these works for you.
Postscript printers are great!

One of our user did try the windows version of pine under OS/2 (2.1?).
He reported several unusual problems.  Many, but perhaps not all, went
away when he reinstalled OS/2.  I'ld be curious to hear how wpine
works with the new OS/2

Getting pine to work under OS/2 has not been a high priority.  I'm not
even sure there is a OS/2 host that I could test on.

Subject: Re: 2010 evolution ?

My 2010 picks up interference on 455 kHz with the external antenna
unplugged, but it stops when I plug anything into the AM antenna socket,
including a adapter plug with nothing connected to it, or the supplied
wire antenna all coiled up and set atop the radio (which you'd think
would pick up any radiation from the radio).  The set is serial number
303337, bought in August '89, and it has both Kiwa filters installed.
The front end isn't blown (last time I checked), but the radio is deafer
than some.  (A friend's newer one is noticeably more sensitive.)

   My radio produces another spurious noise when it's turned up loud in
Sync or SSB mode (7 or more on a strong station).  Some
vibration-sensitive component produces a signal in response to vibration
from the speaker, resulting a howl of feedback.  You can hear sound
produced by the component at lower volumes by tapping on the case.  By
tapping around inside the radio with the back off, I could tell that the
component is inside a metal box on the lower right corner of the main
circuit board (as you face the back of the radio), but I didn't feel
like unsoldering the box.  (This is the AM VCO 1 section.)  My friend's
radio is also vibration-sensitive, but not enough to cause feedback.
Has anybody else noticed this problem and figured out how to fix it?
(Foam on the mounting clips didn't help.)

Hi All Pine Users,

Has anyone had the following problem:

I am currently using the ipop3d server to service all my PC users on our 
network.  Some users use the PC mail packages only to detect whether new 
mail has arrived and then go into PINE on our UNIX system to read their mail. 
My problem is that when they fire up PINE after a few minutes they get the
error message:
"Another Pine accessing your INBOX. Session chnaged to read only."

Now I know for sure that it is the ipop3d server setting the lock on the
users mailbox. 

My PINE version is 3.91

Has anyone else had this problem ????.
Is this a bug/feature with the interaction of PINE and ipop3d ???.

Please _HELP_

It would be *wonderful* if Pine were to have a flag, like Elm's -i
flag, that would allow it to start up in composition mode with a
preloaded file in editing.

This would allow us to use Pine's composition screen to compose
replies to news, even if we do not use Pine's newsreader.  It would
also facilitate the use of Pine for filling out forms to be sent via
email.

It seems like a fairly simple feature change.  In Elm it was added as
part of a mostly bug-fix release, it didn't add much extra code at
all.

Thanks!

I found this out when I tried to set text/html to start lynx.  So long
as the text in question is 7-bit clean, Pine assumes you would rather
read any text attachment from within Pine rather than have Pine start
up a viewer.

Silly, perhaps.  But what content types to handle and which to
outsource to the mailcap viewers is an important design decision in
any program which uses MIME.  Some programs go too far the other way.
For example, lynx will happily observe a mailcap incantation telling
it to invoke lynx to read text/html, which will observe the mailcap
line and invoke lynx, which will invoke lynx, which will invoke
lynx...

I think you'll find it is indeed an interation between Pine and the POP 
server.

POP mail clients check for new mail by periodically connecting to the POP 
server.  This will grab the mail folder lock from any other process (IMAP 
server, POP server or Pine session).  When this happens the Pine user 
will be notified that the mail folder has become read-only (but the 
message will incorrectly say it is another Pine session ... in fact it is 
just another mail client).

One of my users has requested the following feature. It strikes me as 
icing on the cake, but I would be interested in other people's views.

He finds that he wants to have multiple copies of outgoing mail in 
different folders, and would like an easier way to do that than 
repeatedly Saving. His suggestion is that he be allowed comma delimited 
notation in the Fcc field, with the interpretation that it is a list of 
folders to be written to.

Hi all,

I'm not usually using Eudora, but I've read in one of the last mails posted
in this group that Eudora was still Binhexing the binary files even when the
AppleDouble encoding was chosen from the "mail composition window" in version
1.4.3 and it was suggested that this was a kind of "bug". This is false ! You
can send binary files using AppleDouble format from the mail composition
window and selecting Attach Document from the Mail menu. If you want the file
to be sent properly you also have to uncheck the "send as document" (= send as
Mac Document) option available from the popup menu. Than it works. A GIF file
sent by Eudora 1.4.3 to my station can be viewed with xv within Pine. IT works
properly.

Headers are :

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="========================_30353244==_"
X-Mailer: Eudora F1.4.3

AppleDouble selected + Send as (Mac) Document unselected + Quote Printable



Of course, good things to do by default in Eudora would be :

	1 - uncheck the "send as document" option
	2 - check the Quoted-Printable option
	3 - prefer AppleDouble instead of BinHex as encoding format

It's pretty nice to read Pine related news from this group so could we follow
this discussion in comp.mail ?

Bye
Guy

I've noticed that in pine 3.91 (compiled under A/UX), the bounce command
doesn't bounce messages to addresses that are of the form "user@host", but
it does bounce to addresses of the form "user@host.fully.qualified.domain"
or just "user". There is no error reported when the bounce doesn't occur,
so it _looks_ like the bounce got delivered... but I know it doesn't.

This isn't a local sendmail configuration problem (I don't think) as I can
send mail from within pine to addresses of the "user@host" type.

Ideas?

The third form is correct and the last should work.  Does the host you are
connecting to have IMAP service configured properly?

To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu

MIDnet now provides "IMAP" access to all contributions mailed to the
net-happenings mailing list.   This means if you have a mail client that
is imap-compliant (i.e., pine), you may read the latest articles off
MIDnet's IMAP server.  By offering this kind of access, you don't have to
subscribe to net-happenings yourself, just rely on MIDnet to provide you
the articles.  The format for accessing an IMAP server is:

	*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/yy-mm-dd

where you replace yy with "94", mm with "11", "10", etc and dd with "01",
"11", etc.

For example, after you press "g" in pine (for the "go-to" command), you 
would enter the above string like this:

	*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/94-11-21

If you have comments or suggestions on how this service might be improved,
send mail to nic@mid.net.

My site runs v3.89 (still!). When I fire up Pine, it puts me in the
main menu. Is there a way to configure Pine so that it drops me straight
into my INBOX? I tried the command `pine -i i', but Pine interpreted 
this as an attempt to compose a message to someone with the userid 'i'.

Thanks for your help!

I figured out how to do it, though (like the Wizard of Oz) I'm not
sure how the damn thing works.  'pine -i' with no additional para-

Comes here Mr. Don Loflin with this query in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 1 Dec 1994 12:07:44 -0600:

 +   For instance, I'm on the 'tcp-group' mailing list, which has reasonably
 +   high traffic at times.  But some messages are sent to the list using
 +   To:, some using Cc:.  So to select them all, I have to hit '; T T
 +   tcp-group <CR>' and then '; B T C tcp-group <CR>'. 

Try this:

; T A tcp-group

That should work. You can also type tcp-group@its.complete.e-mailaddrs
to make the selection process much more stringent. Enjoy!

PS: However the 'macro' idea isin't that bad at all. Infact what will be
    more kewl is if i can define 'macros' in pico(a la vi keymaps).

Sine pine shows the digests like MIME attcachments, I'd like to see 
dealing with indexes of MIME attachments to have the same functionality
as dealing with indexes of mail folders.

Then a digest will look like a mail folder and one could save the
interesting messages with the group commands.

Does anyone have a suggestion on a method to allow users to forward mail
send to an imap server when either:

a)	It's a machine they don't have a login to directly

or

b)	It's a machine where they have a restricted shell which only allows
	them to spawn pine, etc.

I'm looking for an automated method that doesn't require the Sys. Admin 
do anything.  I could probably write up a script of somesort but it's a
pain and difficult to maintain and keep secure.

I just wanted to add my US$0.02 to this silly debate:

I like Pine.  As soon as it was offered on our systems here (3.05), I
stopped using everything else.  I like 3.9x's config screens.  I like the
message select features (esp. mass delete :-). 

The news reader is great.  I, however, choose to use nn because I am more
familiar with it and it offers a few more features (and I'm the nn support
dweeb here). 

The Pine Development Team should congratulated, not criticized.  Sooner or
later, participants in this "debate" will realize that software publishers
cannot satisfy each and every user's whims and desires.  And the source
*is* freely available ... 

As the old saying goes "RTFM" ...   :-)

I've discovered the cause of the problem by reading the source of
mailpart.c. Anything in the mailcap file that starts with TEXT/...
or MESSAGE/... will be ignored because there are hard-coded
interpretations in Pine for them.

I now use application/x-pgp and can get on with handling the next
problem now ;-).

As a matter of interest: is it a feature or a bug that users cannot
define their own subtypes for the types TEXT and MESSAGE?

Ah....finally, someone else using DG/UX. :)

OK, the version of Pine that's set up on The Point is Pine 3.89, and the 
version of pico needed is UW Pico (tm) 2.3. 

I've no idea where to get pico, but Pine can be found at 
pine.cac.washington.edu.

Good luck,

Hi!

I've a question regarding Pine and its folder handling.

I want to save the EMail correspondence with several people in several 
different folders, i.e. every mail I send to a specific persons should be automaticially saved in a specific folder and every mail I receive from this person should be saved in the same folder.

Can this be done automatically by pine?

Thank you for any information,
Stefan

Sendmail at the mail host should be configured to accept mail for all the 
hosts in the network. The local hosts should forward all the mail to the 
hub. So you should configure sendmail.cf in the local hosts to do that. 
Or else you may set the smtp-server in .pinerc to point to the hub.

i missed the beginning of this thread that actually asked the
question, but from this proposal is sounds like someone wanted
to make a mailing list of sorts.

have your root create an /etc/aliases entry that defines an :include: file
that you can edit without being root. that way you are not creating
a new account, do not have to mess with .forward files, and do not have
to be root to maintain the list.

Does pine have an option to trace an outgoing message? By tracing, I mean
having the mail program tell me the major nodes a message goes through
as it travels to its destination.

Thanks!

Hi!

Does anybody know if pine can be used to send/receive plain text
messages with characters above 128 in code table? When I type text with
these characters, pine always converts it into unreadable MIME format.
Everything is OK if such a message is delivered to recipient which is
also using pine or other mail reader with MIME capabilities. But there
are lot of people who don't even know about MIME or they don't use it by
some reason.

Actually I'm talking about users from Russia, Ukraine, etc. Many of them
have already experienced with such an unreadable mail. Is there any way
to avoid this incompatibility and to make pine to send plain text with
characters >= 128 ?

BTW there is standard de facto for Latin/Russian character set: koi8-r

You don't say what type of system you're dealing with so I'll assume
it's a UNIX system on the Internet.

Short answer: No.

Longer discursive answer:

On UNIX systems Pine usually hands off the message to sendmail(8) to
do the real work of sending it. Sendmail will add "Received" headers
to the message as it travels to its destination, so the recipient can
get an idea of the path by which the message arrived.  Usually though
that's completely uninteresting data, unless you're a postmaster
trying to sort out a mail problem.  Then those headers are invaluable.
(Unfortunately I speak from experience.)  Pine doesn't normally show
you those headers unless you ask to see them by turning on 'Full
Header Mode'.

>From the sender's viewpoint, though, sendmail simply makes an SMTP
connection to the recipient's system, with no particular notion of
passing through "major nodes" along the way.  If you want to see the
actual network path that will be taken then you can try using the
'traceroute' program, though since routing on the Internet can change
dynamically there's no guarantee your email message will follow the
path traceroute showed you.  And email addresses don't necessarily
correspond to physical machines, so it could take some additional
sleuthing with DNS tools like nslookup(8) to figure out where email
really is destined.

Fortunately from a user's point of view you almost never need worry
about the path taken, any more than you need worry about the path a
letter takes after you drop it in a mailbox.

But won't that do a full text search of the folder (since A means 
"All Text")?  For a big folder it would be *much* more efficient to
search only the To and Cc lines.  It would be nice if you could
just search the headers, e.g., by typing:  ;THtcp-group

Yes, yes!  Macros and key remapping in Pine and Pico would be great.

You may think MIME encoding is a bother, and want to work around it,
but it may be your best chance to get 8-bit data intact in email from
Mexico to Russia.  I'd be surprised if you have an 8-bit-clean email
path between Mexico and Russia!  If you send 8-bit data over channels
that only can handle 7-bit data then your recipients won't see your
message intact.  MIME is a safe, standard way to send 8-bit data
across 7-bit email channels.

If you get a copy of the comp.mail.mime Frequently Asked Questions
file (available via anonymous ftp from
rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/comp.mail.mime, or check the comp.mail.mime
or news.answers newsgroups) then it will explain this in detail.  It
also will list the various MIME decoders besides Pine your recipients
could use.

Yow.  Shared accounts and private email go together like jogging and
nitroglycerin.  (The security implications of shared accounts are
usually explosive, too.)

:
:How can I do password-protected folders? 

In Pine, I guess you could try hacking folder password protection into
the source code.  Since UNIX doesn't have the concept of
password-protected files you'd have a bit of work to do.  But how
would you keep the account sharers from bypassing the password inside
Pine simply by reading the disk file?  You've lost all the usefulness
of UNIX file protections by sharing the account!

Outside of Pine, if you're using something like deliver or procmail to
send mail to separate folders (how do you distinguish what goes in
which folder?) then you could try encrypting the message with a
per-folder key when you write it out to the folder.  Then to read it
inside Pine, hack in a decryption thing that prompts for the key.
(While you're at it, make it a general folder-processing module so
that you could substitute uncompressing for decryption.)

When we originally started using Pine last year, the 'y' option worked great 
for printing to a printer attached to a workstation.  However, somewhere along 
the line, the configuration has been changed so that now whenever we print 
E-mail from Pine it prints the first page correctly but all subsequent pages 
print in very small print.  

It seems as though some control character is being passed to the printer after 
the first page is printed that causes this.  Has anyone out there experienced 
this, and do you know of anyway to fix it?

Thanks in advance

Installation problem - module os_vms.c refers to a
routine get_local_host_name which seems to have gone missing in the
current code. I cut the code from the v 3.89 source and pasted it into
[c-client]tcp_vmsl.c and rebuilt to fix the unresolved reference.

I have a similar problem but it is sporadic or not related to any event

a month.

: Necessary fix seems to be using an editor to get down to a line that

That's news to me. Not that you are wrong.  just have not hard about 
that, but obviously there is some thing wrong somewhere that need fixing. 

: But, why does this happen so often?  I don't think it is anything she is

Same story here for me.  The syssops say it has nothing to do with their

To read NN folders from Pine set these variables in your 
NN ~/.nn/init file:

set mail-format on
set folder ~/mail
set mail-record ~/mail/mailed-messages
set news-record ~/mail/posted-messages

Of course you can name the last two folders whatever you like.
news.software.nn and comp.mail.pine are good places to discuss
NN and Pine.

Hope this helps,
Nancy

hi all,
have pine 3.90; how does one change the mail quote format.
currently reply with    on date name wrote:
i didn't see a reference to this in .pinerc or config menu.
is there a line or option i can write to the .pinerc file to change this?
i've noticed the newsreader tin has a configurable option for mail reply 
and it works through pine so i guess there is a way to do this but i'm 
not sure of command line syntax.
thanks for any info

I'd like to make a suggestion concerning the way pine makes itself 
read-only when another pine session is opened at the same time.
Have an option that lets the user decide to either make both pines 
read-only, the original instance of pine, or the new instance of pine.
With the default configuration being to lock up both, or the original.

Thanks

David and David:
This message usually means that Pine didn't recognize the first line of 
the file as a valid message delimiter line (e.g. "From ...")

This can either mean that Pine is not recognizing a valid format (in which
case we need to know about it), or another process (e.g. the mail delivery
process) is not writing the file correctly.  This last case would be most
noticeable if the INBOX was normally kept empty. 

File locking problems, or an undiscovered --but very subtle-- Pine bug in
rewriting the mailbox are other possibilities.  (I say subtle because in over
four years of intensive Pine use, I've never encountered the error myself.)

DRB: what do you find in the file before the valid "From " line? Perhaps the
following would help track down the culprit: after exiting Pine (in a session
where the inbox was opened successfully) make a copy of the inbox.  Then just
before starting Pine the next day, make another copy and do a diff.  If when
starting Pine, the error occurs, quit and make yet a third copy.  That way
you can both determine whether Pine is the cause of whatever it is
complaining about, and exactly what the bogus data looks like. 

Everyone: if this happens to you, send the first few lines of the file to 
"pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu" so we can determine if there is any 
pattern.  It would be nice to get to the bottom of this problem.

Thanks.

Yup, ipop3d is quite capable of stealing the read/write token away from 
Pine.  It's a feature.  The only advice I can give is ``don't use POP 
when you're using Pine''.

There is no workaround when using POP.  The POP3 specification is quite 
emphatic about having exclusive access to the mail box file.

If all you want is a periodic probe for new mail, you can use an IMAP 
connection to the server instead of POP (this assumes you have the source 
code for your PC-based probing software).  Use the IMAP EXAMINE command 
instead of the normal SELECT, and it won't steal the read/write token 
away from any Pines that have it open.

Comes here Mz. Nancy McGough with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 3 Dec 1994 21:23:25 GMT:

 +   >; T A tcp-group
 +   But won't that do a full text search of the folder (since A means 
 +   "All Text")?  For a big folder it would be *much* more efficient to
 +   search only the To and Cc lines.  It would be nice if you could
 +   just search the headers, e.g., by typing:  ;THtcp-group

Yes and that's the kewl thing about it. You don't have to do the selection
twice. Imagine you do the selection for the To: headers and then if you want
to select the Cc: headers too, you will *have* to use Broaden/Narrow selction
method which is a pain. Instead if you do ;TA and then type 'nancym' it will 
select all the mail which has headers equal to that value either in To: or Cc:
at the same time. The only problem with this is that it will select a mail
if it has nancym in its body, even if the headers of that mail don't match.
So in order to make the search criteria extensive/stringent you would type 
the whole address 'nancym@ii.com', and this will result in an  appropriate
selection.

> For a big folder it would be *much* more efficient to search only the 
> To and Cc lines. 

Yes, I agree with that. But the current versions don't support that yet. So
instead of doing Broaden/Narrow Selection method, ;TA method works for me.

Randy,
This usually means that your /etc/hosts file lists the "short" name (i.e. 
gandalf) before the fully qualified name... However, you can set the 
user-domain variable in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf to whatever domain you 
wish Pine to use.

I am not a unix programmer.  But what might work is this: a menu, like this:

				Choose Option

			1. IRC
			2. Email


And if they choose #2, they get asked their mailname and password; and 
then I put them right into their own folder in Pine.  In the script 
making up the menu, I can move the folders in and out of the ~/mail 
directory, so that in the folder list screen of Pine they see only the 
inbox, sent-mail, and their own folder.  

I don't know how to make a script that could do this menu, and I don't 
know how to store the passwords and the usernames somewhere.  There must 
be other people who have done menu's on unix.  Can someone help me?

A related question: I use pine for reading mail (using IMAP) both at work
and from home (over a dialup PPP connection). Normally I leave pine running
on my workstation at work and when I access my mailbox from home the IMAP
server will steal the lock (and the pine running at work will have the 
mailbox open read-only). All this is fine, but when I come back to work I
would like to reopen my mailbox read/write without having to restart pine.
Is this possible?

Forgive me is this has been discussed before but I just discovered this 
group.....

Yesterday when I went into pine 3.91 which I've been using flawlessly for 
the last few months my inbox said it contained 0 items rather than the 18 
which have been in it for the past few weeks.  Any idea what happened to 
my mail and is there a way to retrieve it?   I use Pine 3.91 and this has 
happened once before...I'm checking my mail daily.

At the present time, it is not possible to reopen your INBOX read/write
without restarting Pine.  It is technically possible and the low-level
calls to do it are straightforward.  It's just a matter of building a user
interface to do this. 

I'm not the user interface designer; I do the low-level stuff.  Here is my
understanding of what's going on, but don't take this as gospel: 

The problem with adding a command to do this is that such a command would
pretty much do all of the work of exiting and restarting Pine.  Since Pine
is running short of single-letter commands, do we really want to spend one
of the last available characters to do something you can do with the 6
character sequence qpine<return>?

I have recently discovered a misfeature in the low-level code of Pine.  

Pine dynamically selects what routines to use for reading your mail based
upon the observed format of your mail.  When you select a folder by its
file name, it will try all possible formats of mail and failing these will
finally fall through to a default "file" format which treats the entire
file as one big message. 

INBOX is handled differently.  Ultimately, INBOX is your mail in
/usr/spool/mail.  This file may be empty, or it may not exist at all.  But
this does not mean that you don't have an INBOX; you *always* have an
INBOX.  It just means that it falls through to a default handler that
waits for an INBOX file to exist with valid mail data.  The "file" format
does not respond to INBOX requests. 

Here lies the misfeature.  If you have a /usr/spool/mail file, but the 
file is not in any valid mail format, it is treated as if the file is 
empty!  This shouldn't cause any loss of data, since the file shouldn't 
ever get rewritten.  However, what the user sees is an apparently empty 
INBOX instead of getting an error message that something is wrong with 
the INBOX.

This problem will be fixed in Pine 3.92.  You should ask your local system
administrators (or some other local expert) to look at your mail file and 
see if there is something wrong with it.  We would appreciate being told 
what forms of invalid format mail files are appearing, so please ask your 
expert to tell us what they found after they fixed your mail file.

In the UNIX version you can specify a series of keystrokes in the .pinerc.

Greetings!

We are thinking about making PC-Pine 3.91 available to our students.  I 
tried setting userid=${USERID} in the global Pine configuration file in 
the hopes that Pine would pick use the USERID set upon login, but that 
did not work. : (  Can you offer any consolation?

On a different matter, I had a really long note in the postponed mail
folder (stored on a remote server).  I pressed "C" to compose and selected
it.  Incidentally, I was using PC-Pine for Windows.  Pine aborted the
operation and I lost the message because, purportedly, I didn't have a
remote folder open.  This seems to be a "flaw" to me.

Anyway, I am really happy with Pine 3.91 in general and PC-Pine for
Windows in particular.  The University of Washington should get the
Presidential Medal of Honor! = )

I am using elm currently.  Recently I decided to have a look at
pine.  I compiled pine-3.91, and the interface appears attractive.
However, there is no "Content-Length" field in emails sent through
pine. Elm has such a field in the header.   I briefly checked
all the configuration parameters and couldn't find one that
can turn on such a field.

Hello, Nancy.  I am currently running PCPine 3.91 in Windows.  I have a SLIP 
connection.  I cannot think of anything special to tell you, except that
you should be logged in first with whatever protocol that you are using.
Then, run PCPine.  That's it, as far as I can see.  I hope this helps.

Perhaps someone else can provide more details, if any.

	Is what you want:

	It is in the configuration menu.

Hello, everyone.  I use PC-Pine 3.91 on my home PC, and, 
usually, I don't have many problems with it.  But, in the last 
couple of days, some wierd things have happened.

I loaded Pine to send/receive mail a couple of days ago, and I 
typed "L" (to list folders).  I asked for the expanded list of 
mail folders, and, to my surprise, only INBOX appeared.  I 
know that I have more folders, i.e. sentmail, readmail, etc.
During that particular session, I had to create a new folder 
for sentmail, and one for readmail, I believe.  Yesterday, 
when I again loaded Pine, all the mail folders appeared.  
Today, just a few minutes ago, I loaded Pine to send/receive 
mail, and only the INBOX appeared in the expanded list for mail.

Does anyone else have this problem?  If so, do you know the 
cause and/or the solution?  Please e-mail me, with any ideas 
and/or suggestions? 

Thanks in advance.

Debra

    My idea is that when a folder becomes read-only, those commands
which require the folder to be open no longer have any effect.
Specifically ``X'' for expunging messages.
    If the ``X'' command were to switch from its normal ``eXpunge''
meaning to that of attempting to reopen the folder, no more letters
would be used, and there would be no need to exit Pine, especially
for those of us who have established connections to folders all over...
    Similarly, ``X'' could try to re-open a folder which has become
closed due to acces error, of which I shall write more in private.

Hello everyone,

I tried to find this in the FAQ-lists and mail archives with 
no success, so here goes..

Sun Mailtool uses the Content-Length header line to determine 
the actual lenght of an email. This is particularly useful when
sending a mailfolder or email messages as an attachment, because
they have lines beginning with From: that are really just
part of the message, not the beginning of another.

Pine doesn't seem to use the Content-Length line, it breaks 
messages with other messages as attachments to separate messages.
Have I missed something obvious or is this an incompatibility
between Sun Mailtool and Pine?

RTFMs and pointers are welcome.

	I seem to have misplaced it....but Mark Crispin had an excellent
piece on "horrors of Content-Length".

	Bottom line, it is not a reliable header.  Much can happen to a
message as it passes between MTAs that can have an effect on the
actual length of a message.  Can you imagine what would happen is an
MTA converted CR into CR+LF and the Content-Length remained unchanged?
The message:

	...make sure you turn the power off

may be displayed instead of what was actually received.

	...make sure you turn the power off and then on after changing the
	switch setting.  Failure to do so.....

	Just like there are lots of good reasons that pine doesn't use
uuencode there are other good reasons why it doesn't use Content-Length:

	The *real* question you should be asking is...."Why does SUN
insist on using Content-Length: headers?

Hi Pine-people

Can pine search for new newsgroups not currently listed ind the .newsrc 
file ?

When using OTHER newstools than pine, I'm asked to subscribe to new 
newsgroups (if any) that currently was not listed in the .newsrc-file.
If I don't subscribe, the new newsgroup is just added to my .newsrc as 
unsubscribed, but it is added.

When using pine (3.91) as newsreader/tool, I don't think there is a 
possibillity to check if there is any new newsgroup not listed in the 
.newsrc-file, and in time, my .newsrc will therefore not be updated if I 
don't use other newstools.

If I have missed somthing, and it IS possible please tell me how. If not 
I would like it implemented in next version.

Pine uses MIME encoding to send binary attachments over SMTP. This means 
that your attachments will be understood by others using Pine, as well as 
Eudora on PCs and Macs.

MIME has not been adopted widely. Most users can read attachments 
encoding using uuencoding, however. To send a binary attachment with 
uuencoding, you have to encode the file, then include the encoded text in 
the body of your message.

The syntax for uuencoding is:

uuencode filename.ext filename.ext > filename.uue

Ed,

I guess I was asking for it.. :-) 

Yes, I realize that Content-Length is not a safe header, just like 
sending 8bit characters in email makes some MTAs puke. But 
Content-Length seems to work at least most of the time just fine, 
since other mailers like Elm and Mailtool have some error resilience 
built-in for cases when Content-Length is not correct. Looking at
Elm source code, it is not even overly difficult to code. 

Pine looks really wonderful, but this "feature" makes it unusable
for me. I guess I'll stick with Elm.. At the office I use Mailtool,
but I need a tty-based mailer for dial-in connections.

Hmm, why didn't I think of that.. I'll put E in the mailer flags in 
sendmail.cf, it should do the trick. Thanks, I'll be able to use Pine after all!

What's the performance like? I prefer MH (exmh really) but if pine will

I assume you are using PMDF's Pine. The fcc in 3.89 does not put in subject
or a proper From field. This will be corrected in the next version 3.91.

Sendit is just the delivery program we use on many systems at the Univ. 
of Washington.  You may be better off getting one of the more well-known 
programs which has been tuned for portability.  Procmail and deliver are 
two that come to mind.

    Actually, MIME permits you to send 8-bit characters in one of three
possibilities -- BASE64, which would be useful where the majority of
the text is composed of non-ASCII characters, like Russian, or QUOTED-
PRINTABLE, which is usually used when only a few characters are non-ASCII,
as in German, French, and so on.  Pine3.91 uses both of these.

    There is a third possibility, which Pine3.92 will support, which is
8BIT, which actually sends 8-bit data, but only if Pine can guarantee from
the receiving MTA that the 8-bit data will not get lost.  At present only a
limited number of mailers support this 8BITMIME ESMTP capability (and
not all of them do perfectly, which will be the subject of an upcoming
message); however, I would guess that the number of mailers which do
support this will increase quite rapidly, since Eric Allman has made a
post to comp.mail.sendmail yesterday to outline the changes upcoming in
BSD Sendmail v8.7, which include 8BITMIME support.  I would guess that
Pine3.92 will be released about the same time, or shortly before, a
stable release of 8.7 appears, but that's only a guess.

    The problem is not that a TCP/IP link would not be 8-bit clean, but
that some intermediate mailer, or the originating or receiving mailer,
would strip the data to 7 bits, or less likely, gag on the 8-bit data.

    Luckily, much e-mail can be sent directly from one machine to another,
or is handled by only one additional machine, making it quite possible
to send 8-bit data from one site to an obscure remote one and not have
the 8-bit data lost, giving the immediacy most of us have come to expect
of e-mail.

    While probably a majority of non-US sites might have 8-bit-clean MTAs
(the sendmail program which passes the mail from one machine to another),
there are still those which can be found which will lose your 8-bit data.
You may find a reasonably high occurrence of 8-bit-clean mailers outside
the US because of the need for people there to use 8-bit data in their
mail, and there are a good number of US sites which are 8-bit clean as well,
due to the widespread adoption of BSD sendmail v8.6.9, whose default
configuration is to pass 8-bit data.


>Anyway I think that it would be good

    It may surprise you to learn that the only standard relating to mail
on the Internet specifically forbids sending anything beyond ASCII text.
Unfortunately, this standard was written way back when it was not felt
there would be a need to support anything beyond ASCII, and some machines
would not even handle octets of bits as bytes.  Unfortunately, because
this *is* the standard, everything must comply with it or an extension.
Thus, strictly speaking, these JustSend8 mailers are in violation of
RFC822.  If I could remember the number of the RFC which refers to the
8BITMIME ESMTP option, I'd refer you to it, but by using Pine3.92 and up
and an MTA which supports 8BITMIME, you will be able to send pure 8-bit
text with the guarantee it will not get stripped to 7 bits.

    My gut feeling is that those sites which have adopted JustSend8 MTAs
will quickly upgrade to 8BITMIME capable ones to take advantage of this.

    Remember that just because something is widely used does not make it
a standard.  You will not be able to send me 8-bit mail at the address
from which I post this, unless it arrives with MIME transport, so you
cannot say it is a standard to send 8-bit text.

    I can receive 8BITMIME mail at the address in the Reply-To: field.
I'll hold off on further discussion of this until I compose my post
concerning Pine3.92's 8BITMIME support.  PLEASE NOTE that Pine3.92 has
*NOT* been released yet so don't ask where to find it.

I have installed a copy of Pine3.91 on my machine to evaluate it for my 
users.  So far it is working out great with no problems.  However, 
when I start up Pine the following message appears:
 "libsocket: open (/dev/socksys) failure: No Such File or Directory"
This message appears 4 times and then the main menu of Pine appears.  
Pine works fine and there doesn't not seen to be any problems, but I 
would like to find out what is missing and take care of the problem. 

We are running on a AcerAltos 7000 (90mhz Pentium) cpu and the OS is
Altos/SCO Unix System V/386 Release 3.2 Version 4.2aC0 Run Time.  
Our system is just a "vanilla" setup with no network just serial 
terminals and printers.   As I get my users trained and the remote sites 
computerized we will be upgrading to a SLIP connection with our local 
Internet provider.

I assume that Pine is looking for a network connection and needs to be
told that none is available. I have looked through the docs and did not see
anything that referred to Unix networks directly.  Is this a setup 
configuration or a compile time option?  
Any help would be appreciated.  Thank You in advance.

Hi!

I've noticed that pine "truncates" double spaces in the subject line
into single spaces; i.e., an original subject such as
"This  subject  line" becomes
"This subject line" when displayed by pine.
Why? Better still: how can I prevent this?

Please reply by email, as I don't usually read this newsgroup.

Many thanks,

Paulo

Not surprising!   The Internet is a a fully connected network at the
session level -- any two nodes on the Internet can set up a direct
connection and they are guaranteed an 8-bit data path.  Only if some
other transport mechanism is involved (e.g., BITNET) is the 8-bit
data path not guaranteed.  So, to exchange email with 8-bit text,
only the two end nodes -- modulo any MX records on enemy sites --
need to understand 8-bit SMTP.

I went through this discussion before with some of users who wanted
the sendmail installed here to support 8-bit text.  They convinced me
that it should.  Why?  Because I came to understand that:

     If two end-users by mutual consent wish to break the standards
     without anybody else being affected, I should not come in their way.

So I reinstalled sendmail with the appropriate definitions, and they
were happy.  Nobody else noticed any difference.  I didn't notice
any difference.

In the case of a transport agent like sendmail, the pro-8-bit argument
has perhaps more merit than in the case of pine -- because it's hard to
bypass sendmail, but it's easy to bypass pine.  But I still think the
argument is worth hearing.  The ideal mail user agent will allow the
user to include 8-bit text, perhaps by having to explicitly request
this to avoid accidents.  This option is obviously for only those users
who make a deliberate decision to use 8-bit text.  But if two such
consenting adults both make this decision, the rest of us should not
come in their way.

Also, consider this:  A large fraction of Usenet news postings include
8-bit text.  They will not go away.  Any integration of News and mail
must allow for a few megabytes a day of incoming Usenet postings
containing 8-bit text.  So, one may as well take integration a tiny
step further and allow for outgoing postings and email messages
containing 8-bit text too.

This is emphatically not an either/or issue.  Encoding of 8-bit text is
a necessity when an executable binary is being transported, so it
should be supported.  But encoding of 8-bit text yields no benefit when
"consenting adults" are at the ends of a point-to-point link, and all
they want to do is read what the other person wrote, not execute it.

We have just installed pine. At the start, when I wasn't subscribing to any
news groups, I got to see the lot. On another machine, running nn, you can
print this list, take it home and pick out what you want. I'd like to do this
with pine as well. How do I do it?
After I subscribed to those few groups, I no longer got offered to see 
the full list. How do I provoke this?
Thank you.

The file /usr/local/lib/pine.conf is only used as a template for new
users to pine.  The /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixeds provides a way
for sys-admin to set variables for all users.  Be aware though that any
variables set in the 'fixed' file cannot be changed by users.

I installed PC-PINE 3.90 some time ago and it is working fine but I 
thought I would upgrade to 3.91.  I did this and now although I can read 
mail from the server, I get an 'Error connecting to server' message when 
I try to send mail.  I'm using the imapd version 7.8 from Washington

Anyone else had this problem ?

Is there any way to unsubscribe from a group of newsgropus, or selected 
newsgroups in one go, as opposed to unsubscribing from each one 
individually, as I used the newsetup command, and it is too 
time-consuming to trawl through all the list and unsubscribe from all the
ones I don't want. Thanks in advance.

This morning, I went out and ftp-ed pine 3.91 beta 2 from 
lenin.cc.rochester.edu.  After editing the appropriate vmsbuild.com files 
for my system, I started to compile it.  Woah....  After about ten 
minutes, it gets thru the c-client, pico, then crashes on pine.  After 
looking thru the compilation notes, I see that it choked on the nntp 
stuff.  Well, our users don't need pine to read news, they can use other 
VMS newsreaders like vnews =)  So, I took out the nntp references from 
all the build files.  Still no dice :/

I have previously compiled and used pine 3.90 on our system but it had a 
few bugs that made it unusable to the end users, so I scrapped it.  I 
have 3.91 running on my Unix system with no problems and I'd really like 
to get it on my VMS system.

We are running on a MicroVAX 3800 running OpenVMS 6.0 and Multinet 3.3.  
Has anyone been able to get a workable version running on a similar 
setup?  If so, do you have any suggestions to offer?  I'm not a C 
programmer, so I can't really make a whole lot out of some of the errors...

Thank you for any help.

Hello --
I recently installed pine on an DEC Alpha 3300 running OSF.  It works 
great, but now I want to set up a site-wide address book.  

I cannot find the file pine.conf on my system.  I guess I don't have one 
(I haven't done any customization until now.)  I'm looking for a sample 
of pine.conf, particularly the global-address-book variable.

Also, does the global-address file have to be of a particular format?
Would anyone have a sample they would be willing to share??

Thanks!

You should first build the pine.conf file using pine itself:
     pine -conf >/usr/lib/pine.conf
After that, you will be able to start customizing it to suit your needs.

Yes, it wants the TCP/IP code.  It's pretty insistent about it.  So far 
as I know, no simple compile-time switches exist to turn off that 
dependency.  Your only hope is to find someone who can take the code, 
ferret out all the TCP/IP-module dependent code and recompile it for you 
(I assume you don't have the compilers, since your OS says Run Time).

To compile Pine, you need the TCP/IP Developers Version.  To run it, you 
need at least the TCP/IP runtime version.

I got no substantive responses, but yesterday we got a complete NFS lockup
between our (Solaris) SPARCcenter and (SunOS) Auspex fileserver which holds
the mail spool. We switched Pine's access method to IMAP onto a modest Sun
which can support ~15-20 telnet/pine sessions. We happily supported 56
imap connections, which slowed, but did not kill this host.

When another Pine session tries to open the inbox, the first session goes
read-only.  I've always found this awkward - you would think that the second
session would say "inbox already open - opening readonly" instead of "yanking
file lock - your other session is now readonly."  But regardless of this,
since the first session can tell that the inbox has been re-opened, couldn't
it be possible to put the read-only pine session into some sort of loop to
reopen the inbox (read/write) once the second lock is gone?

Hi,

I would like to set a default value for the "Personally selected print
command" and for the "Standard UNIX print command" for all the users
of PINE on our machines. I want also that the first one could be
modified by the user himself.

How can I do that ?		

Thanks in advance.		Gildas.

I'm sure this is not new but some only seem to work for news but not mail.
It _appears_ that I can define the use of a field such as Reply-To: and 
fill in a value on a per mail item basis. Rich headers displays the field 
but pine seems to lose it if I use the direct SMTP or sendmail interfaces.
My organization field seems OK and Reply-To: is fine with the nntp
interface.

Thanks.

I agree it would be great to be able to deal with an index of attachments 
the same way that you deal with a regular folder index, e.g., to be able to 
forward, respond to, or delete individual attachments.

I have a question about how best to format my FAQs so that someone
who uses Pine as his newsreader can easily choose the subjects he's
interested in.  If I format each digest item like this:

------------------------------

  [ Part 1.0: "1.0 Automatic Signature - Basic Unix Instructions" ]

Date: 06 Dec 1994 23:01:00 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 1.0 Automatic Signature - Basic Unix Instructions

[text]

------------------------------


Will Pine users be able to view the index by typing V?
Is this the best strategy for posting digests so Pine users
can read them?  

Thanks for any info,
Nancy

I'm sure this is obvious but I just want to reply to some text but if
I type R , pine 3.91 wants to include 100K of attachment which has been

I'm using the MH interface (rather nice so far for a tty interface).

Alan,
Go to setup/config and turn *off* the "include-attachments-in-reply" 
feature.

Or use ^K on the Attchmnts header line to delete individually.

A user at a remote site says that he cannot use ctrl-c in pine to cancel 
messages.  He ends up just postponing them indefinitely.  I've tried to figure
out what might be causing his troubles to no avail.  ctrl-c is set to
send ascii 003.  intr is set to ctrl-c.  My only guess is that something
on his local system is intercepting the sequence.  

Does anybody have a suggestion for a work-around? 

Any pertinent information that you can provide would be appreciated.

Usually you should put the pine.conf file in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  
The global-address-book line looks just like an address-book line in a 
.pinerc file, for example, it might say

global-address-book=/usr/local/lib/abook     or

global-address-book=Global Address Book /usr/local/lib/abook

The file itself is a standard pine address book.  For example, you could 
create it by copying your own .addressbook to that file.  You'll probably 
want to come up with a better way to do that than copying your own 
address book.  The format of the address book is discussed in the 
technical notes in the doc directory of the source distribution.

How does one disable the KBLock function, we are using pine on an rs6000
running AIX. Pine is our default mail program, and the KBLock feature is
not desired in our lab. 

Thanks for the replies,

When Pine is about to open the INBOX, it says

	Please wait, opening mail folder .......

For various reasons I won't go into, our users are used to spending some
time looking at this message and that's fine. We recently switched to
mounting the mail spool via imap on one of our machines; when the users
started Pine, the status line said something like

HOST: suma2.rdg.ac.uk ENTER LOGIN NAME: suqblogs

but some people were still staring at a point higher up the screen, which 
told them 

	Please wait. Opening mail folder .......

so they did! (wait and wait, that is). Can the message be modified for imap 
connections ("Please look down", "I need your userid on imaphost", "Wakey, 
wakey!" etc)

Mike

Except it will be a pain in the nether region to fill various
mailertables etc with names of all the "consenting adult partners".
I suppose that's one of the reasons why the 8BITMIME-keyword(*) was 
invented in the ESMTP dialogue. So, why not do this the right way
and adopt the 8BITMIME-kayword?

(*) In this context 8BITMIME should probably read "I'm over 18".

Hello Again -- 
I would like to thank those of you who responded to my questions about 
setting up a global address book.  I'm making progress due to the 
technical notes and information you've supplied, but now have another 
question:

I've created the file loyola.addresses in /usr/lib.  It's protection is 
rwxr-xr-x.  I've invoked PINE via root in order to create the 
loyola.addresses.lu file.  

When I attempt to access the public address file via PINE as root I see 
the following messages:

file changed by another process -- resyncing...

resetting...

The cursor then moves to root's own address book.

When I try to access the public address file via a regular user account 
the same messages appear, but the process winds up in an endless loop.  I 
eventually have to break out of my session.

During both attempts at accessing the file, the information in the public 
file was displayed while all of the messages were happening.


Thank You!!!

Mary Aplin

    Have you taken a look at the UltiMail lite version included with
    the Internet connectivity pack?  I have used the full-blown
    version before, and it is pretty nice (MIME compliant).  It does
    not, however, have an ASCII interface (for dial-in, etc...) so a
    PM version of Pine with an ASCII counterpart would be nice!

    The Good News "virus" is URBAN LEGEND and should be
    disregarded...  See the CIAC bulletin for more info.

    To answer Dons question look for this in your .pinerc:

# Pine executes these keys upon startup (e.g. to view msg 13: i,j,1,3,CR,v)
initial-keystroke-list=

    Put an i after initial-keystroke-list= abd it will dump you into
    INBOX automagically.

This doesn't sound quite right.  We're still learning about mailcap so it
has been changing, but at least with 3.91, you can specify viewers for
most types that override the pine builtins.  The current attachment index
won't allow you to select a MULTIPART to view so you can never run an
external viewer for that type.  You should be able to run an external
viewer for any MESSAGE type.  If you don't specify one, Pine will try to
handle it.  You can run an external viewer for type TEXT if the charset is
different from the one you have set in your config file, otherwise, Pine
will intercept it before giving mailcap a chance.  If there isn't a match
in mailcap, Pine will attempt to display it.  The other types are only
displayable with external mailcap viewers.

The reason text/x-pgp doesn't work is because Pine sees a matching charset
(us-ascii) and decides it should display it itself. Perhaps we should only
be intercepting text/plain with a matching charset instead of all text types?

There are some serious address book bugs in 3.90.  You need to upgrade to

You can't put an address in everyone's address book in 3.91.  The bugs-*
entries in the pine.conf file only apply to the Bug Report command.  You
used to be able to put them in the address book, but we removed that
feature because lots and lots of people had our address in their address
books.  We over-reacted.  We should have just removed the default.  In
3.92 there will be a new variable which can be set in the pine.conf file
and will cause some specified addrbook entries to be written into all
personal address books which are writable and don't already have a
matching nickname.

I just tried this and it didn't work.  I named the script pico and
put it in my path before /usr/local/bin/pico.  When I run pico from
the Unix prompt I do invoke the script and autowrap is off, but if I
compose in Pine with Pico, autowrap is on, which makes me think that
Pine has /usr/local/bin/pico hardwired in.  Anyone know a way around
it (other than specifying ``pico -w'' as the alternate editor)?

Thanks,

I think the pico code (for pine's *built in* editor) is internal to pine 
(special handling of header section, same process, etc.).

If you're on a UNIX system, get out to the command prompt issue the following
commands :

	% cd
	% touch mail/sent-mail

This will create an empty sent-mail file. Your other option is to save a piece
of mail to the sent-mail folder.

Subject: Pine 3.91 "cannot unpack 8-bit encoding"?  huh?
Date: 7 Dec 1994 16:03:41 -0500
Message-Id: <3c57vd$2ck@Thunder.McRCIM.McGill.EDU>

X-Status: 

I did look for a FAQ in news.answers, and found none.

Just built pine 3.91 and I really like the way it will unpack MIME
quoted-printable-encoded messages (in the 8859-1 character set) and
display them correctly.

Then I tried to read a NON-encoded, i.e. "Content-Transfer-Encoding:
8-bit" message in the same character set and pine balks.  It won't
display the message, and the multipart viewer claims it doesn't know
how to unpack 8-bit encoding.

Is pine 3.92 due anytime soon?  It shouldn't be too difficult to add
an "8-bit" unpacker. :-)

X-Status: 

I have a message containing MIME attachments that was forwarded to me
through Microsoft mail which, to the best of my knowledge, doesn't
support MIME. The message originated from Pine 3.89, and I'm running
Pine 3.90.  For some reason, Pine does not recognize the MIME
attachments in the message.

I have two questions.  First, did MS Mail somehow munge the header so
that Pine no longer recognizes the attachment? Second, regardless of
whether MS Mail is at fault, can I edit the message directly so that
Pine will recognize the attachments?

Here is the header as it came to me:

 --0-1024407403-786752173:#23303
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; name=temp
Content-Transfer-Encoding: BASE64

Any help would be appreciated.

My pine system captures the text, and then I print to the local printer,

to read different characters each time, but never the whole message.  
Any suggestions?  Please mail me or post here.  Thanx.

Interesting that you mention this. Just a few minutes ago I was discussing
Pine with the sysop on my system, and was advised that we would not be
upgrading to Pine 3.91 because it was not backwards-compatible (ie. will
not read old addressbook and other user-configurable elements). I'd love
to know if this can be overcome. Anyway..thought you might be interested :)

...But now I can't find hide nor hair of it!  So was I imagining it?

If so, is it an option that could be considered for addition (or is it 
part of the user protection in the great Usenet News v Mail debate?)

	Actually, what you state is the header is really the body.  The

	The most important key item is the "Mime-Version:" header, which
tells the UA (in your case pine) that this is a mime message.

	You should be able to edit you heads so that the look like:

For compiled binaries of PINE for SCO Unix, try

ftp:  ftp.celestial.com/pub/sco-sites/unix

(I think I got that correct, I don't have it written down anywhere.
They have two versions--MMDF and non-MMDF.  Read the README files.)

I am having difficulty figuring out how to print pine documents to my 
printer.  I have tried several configurations to no avail.  

Q.Is it possible to print from pine on a Mac using the "ansi" default on 
pine?

Q.Is the configuration problem in my software?  I am using Claris 
communications package.  

Thanks for any help.

After entering the 'folder' environment of PINE, I see below
the mail folders a band which has the message that my home
directory access folder has been disabled, or some such,
and that I should select to restore it.

My question is:  How do I look at my home directory using Pine?
I can see it at the unix % prompt by using the list ls command.
It might be handy to look at it from inside Pine, however.
Any help out there, particularly at the U. Mich. sysop command post?

Thanks.

I have a suggestion for improvement on the Pine program.  
Specifically, an improvement on the Usenet newsreader portion.  I 
noticed that whenever you subscribe to a new newsgroup you get posting 
from months and months back, sometimes there are hundreds on these 
unwanted postings.  The only way to delete these unwanted postings is 
to go through them linearly and delete them.  Here's my suggestion:  
how about a command that would delete all the posting currently held?  
Then, you could read the most current postings and then, with one 
stoke 
of a key, delete all the old postings you're not interested in.

The idea I'm suggesting is similar to the 'catch up' command in the 
newsreader 'rn'.


If you could please reply as to whether this is possible and what 
would be needed to inplement that change, it would be greatly appreciated.

I have just obtained the pine binaries from the source above.
When starting and opening "INBOX", pine exits with messages:

Bug in Pine detected: "Abort  signal recieved"
Exiting Pine.

My system is System V/386 Release 3.2

Could you advise me what to do?

Yes, it is indeed a very good idea.

...and you achieve it using Pine's wonderful Select and Apply commands.  
The former lets you select all or a subset of messages (email or news).  
The latter lets you apply a command to the selection (delete, save, 
print, etc).

Try these four keystrokes:

	; A		...to select all messages
	A D		...to apply a delete command to the selection

See?

	Look in your configuration for the "postponed-folder" entry and
then go to your $HOME/mail directory and rm that file.  That will
return things to normal.  You could also move that file to another file...
and keep the other file around in case the pine team wants a look at
it to see how it became corrupted.

Here Mike has used the ; and the A commands.  The ; and the A commands
(together with the Z command) form Pine's "aggregate command set".  The ;
command allows you to select all the messages that match some criteria;
the A command allows to apply some command to each of the selected
messages; and the Z command allows you to zoom in on the selected messages
by changing the folder index temporarily so that only these messages are
displayed.  

In order to use any of these commands, you need to have
enable-aggregate-command-set included in the setting of the feature-list
variable.  To do this, go to the Main Menu, press S followed by C.  You
should now be in the Config Screen.  Now move the cursor down to the line
containing: 
   [ ]  enable-aggregate-command-set
If there is no X between the [ and ], press X.  You should now have:
   [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set
Press E to leave the Config Screen.  

You should now be able to use the ; A and Z commands.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split a digested article by typing G%
  while viewing it.  This will present each digest item on a submenu.  You
  can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key and
  g key pressed simultaneously) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                             In order to...
-------                             --------------
|                                   Pipe
a                                   Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/Folders/faq.split  Split the digest into individual
                                    messages and put them in a file named
                                    ~/Folders/faq.split.  (Replace ~/Folders
                                    with your folder directory.)
pine -if ~/Folders/faq.split        Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

For more information see the formail(1) and procmail(1) man pages.

Subject: 1.0 Automatic Signature - Basic Unix Instructions

Q: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my news articles
   and mail messages?

A: The answer depends on your newsreader and mailer but the following
   procedure works for many Unix newsreaders and mailers.


Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Change to your home directory (i.e., $HOME or ~)

pico .signature         Use the pico editor to create a .signature file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your signature>        Note that most systems require your sig to be <= 4
                        lines.  And it's good netiquette to make it as
                        short as possible.

<save and exit>         In Pico use ^x to exit and answer y when asked
                        if you want to save your changes.

chmod 644 .signature    Make .signature readable by all.

ls -l .signature        Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                        drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.

For many newsreaders and mailers this is all you need to do to set up your
signature.  For example the default behaviour of tin(1) and the rn family of 
tools - rn(1), trn(1), strn(1), & Pnews(1) - is to automatically append 
 ~/.signature, if it exists.  If you use Pine, Elm, Mail, Emacs Mail Mode, MH, 
NN, or GNUS follow the additional instructions described below.

After you've set everything up use your mailer to mail a test message
to yourself, and your newsreader and/or news poster (such as nnpost or Pnews)
to post an article to a test newsgroup (use a local newsgroup and Distribution
set to ``local'' to save bandwidth).  Note that with many newsreaders and 
mailers you will not see your signature while you are composing a message - 
it will be automaticlally appended when you send the message.  Note also that 
many systems add a line that contains ``-- '' to the top of your sig.  This is 
used by programs that automatically deal with mail or news to identify the 
start of the signature.

If you have a problem with your sig see section 1.9 on Troubleshooting.

Subject: ... 1.1 Pine 3.90 and Above
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

The default for Pine 3.90 and above is to automatically append .signature (if 
it exists) to your messages.  Many people like to set the signature-at-bottom 
variable which will put your signature below both your message and the message 
you are replying to (if you've included it).  Note that if you are forwarding 
a message your signature will be put below the message that you write but 
above the forwarded message.

To change Pine's signature features:

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the signature-at-bottom feature:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the signature-at-bottom variable
   b) Type x to set/unset this variable.
4. To change the name of your signature file:
   a) Arrow down to the signature-file line
   b) Type c for Change Value
   c) Type the path and name of the file you want to use for your
      signature.  Note that ~ can be used for your $HOME directory.

Subject: ... 1.2 Pine 3.89 and Below
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of
Pine 3.89 often want to edit their ~/.pinerc file so that it contains
the following:

feature-list=signature-at-bottom

If you want more than one feature in your feature-list then they need to
be comma separated like this:

feature-list=old-growth,
	signature-at-bottom

Note that Pine's default is to use ~/.signature for your signature so you
only need to edit the following line if you are using a different file.

signature-file=

Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of Elm
should edit their ~/.elm/elmrc file so that it contains the following:

signature = ~/.signature
sigdashes = ON

Remember to delete any # characters before any variables you want
to set.  The defaults are indicated in comment lines starting with ###.

Note that if you want to have a different signature for local mail
(i.e., addresses that don't contain a ! or @) then you can use the
localsignature and remotesignature variables instead of the signature
variable (which specifies one sig for all mail).

Subject: ... 1.4 Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.misc

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Regular Unix "Mail" and "mail" don't have an automatic
signature mechanism.  Many people who normally use a more deluxe
mail utility occasionally find themselves resorting to using one
of these, in which case all you need to know is this command:

	~r $HOME/.signature

This simply tells Mail to include the text of the your signature
file.

=o= If you use Mail on a regular basis you may want to use the
semi-automatic signature feature.  When you're done typing your
message, you append a signature with this command:

	~a

=o= In order for this to work, though, you need to set the
"sign" mail variable.  There are two ways to implement this
variable.  The first is to set it in a $HOME/.mailrc file with
a command like this:

	set sign="Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

If your signature is more than one line long, you can use the
C language string syntax, as in these examples:

	set sign="Jym Dyer\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

			-or-

	set sign="Jym Dyer\
	\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

=o= The disadvantage of doing this in your .mailrc file is
that you now have to maintain the text of your signature in
two places.  Another approach that avoids this problem is to set
"sign" as an environment variable in your shell startup script.
For a Bourne-compatible shell, this is done with this command:

	sign="`cat $HOME/.signature`" export sign

For a C-shell, do this:

	setenv sign "`cat $HOME/.signature`"

Subject: ... 1.5 Emacs Mail Mode

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Emacs Mail Mode is usually invoked with the "mail" or
"mail-other-window" commands (bound, respectively, to the
"C-x m" and "C-x 4 m" keys by default).  It is also invoked
from various Emacs mail and news packages.

=o= Mail Mode provides a "mail-signature" command to append
the contents of your signature file to the end of your mail
message.  This command is bound to "C-c C-w" by default,
so to insert the signature before mailing, simply type
"C-c "C-w".

=o= If you'd prefer to have your signature automatically
appended to the end of your mail message, the "mail-signature"
command can be put into your "mail-setup-hook" variable in
your $HOME/.emacs file, as in this example:

    (setq mail-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
	 (mail-signature) )))

This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.

Subject: ... 1.6 MH and Emacs MH-E
Followup-To: comp.mail.mh

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= MH doesn't have an automatic signature mechanism, but it
is so configurable that there are a number of different ways
to implement one.  Check the periodic "MH Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) with Answers" posting for details.

=o= CAVEAT:  If you use the environment variable SIGNATURE to
point to your signature file, MH will use it not as a signature,
but as your "fullname".  Even worse, if your version of MH was
built with the "UCI" option and you *don't* use the environment
variable SIGNATURE to point to another file, MH will use the
$HOME/.signature file for this purpose!  To see if your version
of MH has this behavior, enter this command:

  % send -help

And look for the string "[UCI]" in the output.

=o= There's an Emacs interface to MH, called MH-E.  It has its
own signature mechanism, which is invoked with the "mh-insert-
signature" command (bound to the "C-c C-s" keys by default).

=o= This will insert the file $HOME/.signature file by default.
If your signature file has another name (e.g., to avoid its
being used by an MH build with the "UCI" option), you can set
the "mh-signature-file-name" variable to refer to a different
file.

should edit their ~/.nn/init file so that it contains the following:

set query-signature off
set append-signature-mail on
set append-signature-post offf

Note that the reason that you need to ``set append-signature-post off'' is
that the news posting software (usually inews) automatically appends
 ~/.signature if it exists.  If you ``set append-signature-post on'' then
both nn and inews append your sig and you'll send out two identical sigs
every time.

Followup-To: gnu.emacs.gnus

Copyright (c) 1994 Mike Northam

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of GNUS
should verify that the value of the variable gnus-signature-file points to the
right place.  If you're in emacs, you can do so by evaluating the following
expression:
gnus-signature-file
                   ^ put your cursor here and type C-x C-e

you should see "~/.signature" in the echo area.  If not, edit your
$HOME/.emacs file and add the following:
(setq gnus-signature-file "~/.signature"))
Then load your $HOME/.emacs file or merely restart emacs and the variable
should be set correctly.

Subject: ... 1.9 Troubleshooting Signature Problems

A common problem people have with .signature (and .plan, .project, and
 .forward ) files is that the permissions are not set correctly.  Check
to make sure that you have set the permissions as instructed in 1.0 above.

If you are still having problems read the man pages for your newsreader,
news poster, or mailer and search for the string "signature".  There may be a
variable you need to set in order for the ~/.signature to be appended.

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
man CommandName |less   Open man pages for CommandName (elm, pine, nn, tin
                        trn, Pnews, etc.) and pipe through less.  If your
                        system doesn't have less replace it with "more".

/signature              Search for first occurrence of "signature".

n                       Search for next occurrence of "signature".
                        Repeat the search until you find the appropriate
                        section of the manual.

u                       Page up half a screen. (This works in less but not in
                        more.)

[spacebar]              Page down a screen. (This works in both less and more.)


For more information on reading manual pages see the man(1), less(1), and/or
more(1) man pages.

Subject: 2.0 Finger - Basic Unix Instructions

People around the world can find out more about you by fingering you.  
This is done by typing the following at a Unix prompt:

   finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

On some systems finger is linked to f so the following also works:

   f YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name


Finger displays different information on different systems.  Often it will 
display your full name, your default shell, when your were last logged on, 
and your ~/.plan and ~/.project files.

If you finger someone and the display takes more than one page you can pipe 
the output through less (or more if you don't have less).  For example to 
find out about Halcyon, my Internet service provider, type:

  finger info@halcyon.com |less

In addition to using the finger or f command you can finger people
through a Web browser.  The following is a form that Doug Stevenson
<doug+@osu.edu> created:
  http://www.mps.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/finger.pl

You can also use this URL:
  gopher://fully.qualified.domain.name:79/0userid
                                          ^ Note: 0 precedes the userid

For example you can finger my Internet service provider with this URL:
  gopher://halcyon.com:79/0info

On many Unix systems you can change some of your default information,
such as your full name, by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

   chfn

If chfn is not available try "passwd -f".  If neither of these are
available then you will need to contact your system administrator and
ask him/her to change your full name, etc.

After you have changed your information check that they are in place
by fingering yourself.  Also to see a different display of your
information type the following at your Unix prompt:

  finger

This displays a one line description of everyone currently logged on
your system.

For more information see the chfn(1), passwd(1), and finger(1) man pages.

Subject: ... 2.3 Adding More to Your Finger Info: .plan & .project

Your ~/.project and ~/.plan files, if they exist, are displayed when you
are fingered.  Setting these up is essentially the same as setting
up a ~/.signature file (described in 1.0 above).

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Change to your home directory.

pico .plan              Use the pico editor to create a .plan file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

chmod 644 .plan         Make .plan readable by all.

ls -l .plan             Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x.
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each.

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.


If you want a .project file follow the same procedure.  Note that only the
first line of the .project is displayed (so you might as well only make
it one line!).

To test your changes finger yourself by type each of the following at your
Unix prompt:

    finger YourUserID
    finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

To ensure that people from other systems can finger you should ask someone 
who's not on your system to finger you too.

Subject: ... 2.4 Finding Out Who Fingers You

This is complicated - and sometimes impossible - to setup.  For details see
the news.answers article ``Unix - Frequently Asked Questions (4/7) [Frequent
posting]'', subject ``4.9) How do I keep track of people who are fingering 
me?'' This article is archived in a number of places including these two URLs:

ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/faq/part4

One easy thing that you can do to see if anyone has fingered you is type the 
following at your Unix prompt:

  ls -lu $HOME/.plan

This tells you the last time someone accessed your .plan, but it doesn't
tell you who it was.  I have this in my .login because it's interesting to
see when the last time someone was checking on me!

[Note that under AFS (Andrew File System, a distributed filesystem),
 ls -lu $HOME/.plan will not work due to the fact that AFS has no 
 notion of ``atime'', or ``last accessed time''.]

Subject: ... 2.5 Backfinger Script

Copyright (c) 1994 Janet Rosenbaum

There is a script available called, among other things, backfinger,
planner, and finger_logger (flogger or frogger, for short).  This script
makes your plan into a named pipe (just think of this as a sort of
pipe used with plumbing that opens out onto the screen of the person who
is fingering you (fred)) so that when it is accessed, it looks for a
program from which to get something to stick on fred's screen.

The script is called when you are fingered.  At that moment, it looks to
the finger port of your unix machine and sees which machine fred is
on, logs that machine's IP number and hostname, and the date.  The script
can then execute a command to spit a plan out on fred's screen.  (One
might get creative and write a program that generates random poetry or
use the fortune program or just do "cat plan_file".)   To make fred
think you are really cool, it also tells him what machine he is
fingering you from.

Some caveats:

	-- This program must be running at all times on your system even
	when you are logged out.  Leaving a background process like this
	annoys most sys admins to no end, especially on systems with
	high load.  Do **not** run the program unless you are sure that
	you are allowed to run background processes like this.

	-- Also, if you decide you want to stop running this program,
	remove your .plan file as soon as you kill the process.  If you
	do not do this, all finger processes for you will hang.

	-- This script only tells you the machine fred is fingering you
	from, not his actual username.  It is nearly impossible to get
	this information except at sites with bad security.


Given the above, I will distribute the script to those who can use it,
mostly for educational reasons.  I admit that I no longer run the
program, since my two main accounts are on rather high-load systems.
Nevertheless, I learned quite a lot from modifying these scripts and
otherwise playing with these ideas.

Here is the web site:

 http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~jrosen/scripts/logger.src

I will also try to post this answer and the program to comp.sources.misc
at least monthly for those without web access.  (For those who have not
figured out the web, try the program lynx if you are on a vt100 or vt220
type terminal.  If you are on an xterm or hpterm, look for xmosaic.)

Note:  I am not the author of this program.  The version I distribute is
virtually identical to that distributed by Steve Franklin.
Here are the real authors:

It is considered good netiquette to keep your signature to four lines or
less.  And many news posters, like inews, will not post an article
that has a signature with more than four lines in it.  So, put large
pictures, your life story, etc. in your finger files or in your Web pages
and point people to them in your signature.

A good source of art for your signature and finger files is the ascii art
FAQ which contains (among others) these topics:
   9  Where can I find ASCII art?
  22  How do I put an animation in my plan?
  23  How do I make a sig?
  24  How do I have my sig automatically added to my posts and email?

The Ascii Art FAQ can be found at either of the following.  (I think
these aren't the same so you might want to look at both of them.)

Followup-To: news.newusers.questions

Tin and the rn family of tools (Pnews, rn, trn, strn) get information for the 
Organization header from the ORGANIZATION environment variable if it exists.  
In the csh or tcsh you can set this variable in your ~/.login with a line like 
this:

  setenv ORGANIZATION "Your Organization Name"

After you edit your ~/.login you can establish the setting by either logging
out and loggin back in or by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

  source ~/.login

To check that the variable is set type:

  printenv

After it is set, post a test message to a local test newsgroup with local
distribution to check that the Organization header is correct.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the customized-hdrs variable.
   b) Type a for Add Value
   c) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
      Note that if you have set the ORGANIZATION environment variable
      (which is described in 4.1 above) you can type: 
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION

While reading a message that you've received you can view the Organization
header and all the other headers by typing h.  If h does not work you need 
to go to your configuration menu and set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

Note that the customized-hdrs variable is not available in Pine 3.89 and

Comes here Mz. Nancy McGough with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 6 Dec 1994 21:35:27 GMT:

 +   I agree it would be great to be able to deal with an index of attachments 
 +   the same way that you deal with a regular folder index, e.g., to be able to
 +   forward, respond to, or delete individual attachments.

That will be the day. Cutting edge s/w technology...:)

 +   I have a question about how best to format my FAQs so that someone
 +   who uses Pine as his newsreader can easily choose the subjects he's
 +   interested in.  If I format each digest item like this: .........
 +   Will Pine users be able to view the index by typing V?
 +   Is this the best strategy for posting digests so Pine users
 +   can read them?  

Although this would be very nice, there are many people who still use older
vers. of Pine. So the FAQ might run into newsgroup-option/mime version
compatibility problems.

How about one MIME digest ver, and the other a regular ver.? :)

Goto the (L)ist screen, then choose the Newsgroups group list. Hit A to

complete list...(S)ubscribe to the ones you want and (E)xit. Enjoy!

The group list is/will be stored in a file called ".newsrc" in your home dir.

The address book code was almost completely rewritten for 3.90 and some
incompatibilities showed up.  In fact, there were some serious address
book problems with 3.90, ranging from not being able to read address books
that worked with 3.89 to some cases where address book data was destroyed. 
3.91 is much better than 3.90 with regards to address book bugs and other
bugs, as well.  3.92 will be even better, I think.  All of these versions
were *supposed* to be backwards-compatible with previous versions of the
address book.  If it still isn't, that's a bug and we'd really like to know
about it.  If anyone has an address book that 3.91 can't read please send
a bug report, including the addressbook as an attachment if possible. 

(3.90+ did introduce a new file, .addressbook.lu, that wasn't in previous 
versions.  This file should be built and maintained automatically.  You 
should be able to remove that file and it will come back by itself.  When 
it creates that file it isn't creating a new addressbook, just a lookup 
file for the same old address book.  The lookup file's purpose is to 
allow us to support large address books without slowing things down and 
without using lots of memory.)

 +   	How about, as well as being able to Zoom in on selected messages, to
 +   be able to *Hide* them? I sometime want to be able to hide all mailing list
 +   messages, for example, so that I can easily read just personal mail. 

How about this key sequence:   ; T ^T Z

;  Selection
T  Text
^T Control-T(Go to the first *personal* mail which is marked + and
   then hit control-t to select those addressed specifically to you)
Z  Zoom the personal mail messages.

	I think you misunderstood the question slightly.  (Or my pine
works a bit different than yours.)  I believe the original poster wanted
to see the entire list of newsgroups that were available placed in a file
so that he could read at his leisure.  

	While the method you describe does *show* all the groups on the
screen....it only saves the ones you've subscribed to in the .newsrc file.

Many thanks for your comments. I'll pass this on to our sysop, and 
hopefully he will attempt to resolve the problem with you.

    Pine does give you both messages, except the ``sending'' apppears first.
Then Pine writes the folder copy.  This appears to be the reverse of the way
earlier Pines would first write the copy, then try sending the mail.

    I notice this because I write my fcc via IMAP over a slow link, and also
use the SMTP client function of Pine, so both can take a bit of time.

    First, Pine verifies that the fcc can be written (opening the IMAP link,
etc.), then sends the message, then writes the fcc, giving you the chance to
correct any errors in specifying fcc, and also not writing your copy until
the message actually did get sent.  Previously, with a *very* old Pine set to
talk SMTP, I could be talking to a SMTP server which wouldn't acknowledge me
in the time I was given, so the message wouldn't be sent, but I would still
have the fcc written.

    Pine is capable of handling properly tagged C-T-E=8BIT messages.
However, it will say that it does not know how to display messages with
a C-T-E of 8BIT, but a charset of US-ASCII.  I guess that is what you
have gotten.

    One shouldn't be sending out 8-bit messages tagged as US-ASCII, but on
the other hand, since no matter whether the text is truly ASCII or some
8-bit character set, it could simply be passed to the display for viewing,
my gut feeling is that Pine here should be forgiving, in the ``be liberal
about what you accept but conservative in what you send out'' philosophy.

    I have had this happen to me, hacking such headers into mail without
thinking about what I was doing and having Pine complain, but Pine has never
had difficulty displaying C-T-E=8BIT text when tagged as ISO-8859-1 or
KOI8-R or VIDEOTEX-SUPPL or whatever you happen to be using.  Only when
said text arrives claiming to be US-ASCII does Pine take notice.

    At the same time, I've had Pine display the 7-bit equivalent of what had
been 8-bit text when the path has not been fully 8-bit clean, in the case of
reading the KOI8-R relcom news articles from a news server that doesn't feel
it important to preserve the 8th bit, so don't expect that simply by putting
a C-T-E=8BIT header in your news or mail, that the 8th bit will be preserved.

I am having trouble with Pine3.91 writing to my .pinerc file and to a temp file to send mail. 
Although it can post to the nntp server. I am at a loss. I have checked my permissions on this 
file and it is correct. I am using Linux and sendmail. 
	When pine starts it tells me 'can't write to .pinerc, unknown error. When I choose 'S'
and configure 'C' to setup pine, after I exit the configuration I get the same error. When
I try to compose mail i get 'can't write to tmp file to send mail' or something to that effect.
I don't know what the problem is. I don't have this problem with pine3.89. If anyone has any ideas
please email me. I will reply using another program.
Thanks

You are entirely correct, as was Mark Crispin who emailed me.  

The problem was of course that the message was NOT properly tagged.
The person sending it a content-transfer-encoding of '8-bit' rather
than '8bit'.  Shoulda checked the RFCs first; sigh.

Comes here Mr. Mark Crispin with this opinion in "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on Sun, 4 Dec 1994 15:55:32 -0800:

 +   The problem with adding a command to do this is that such a command would
 +   pretty much do all of the work of exiting and restarting Pine.  Since Pine
 +   is running short of single-letter commands, do we really want to spend one
 +   of the last available characters to do something you can do with the 6
 +   character sequence qpine<return>? 

True, but atleast something if done in this situation that would help a lot.

Situation:
		I use suspend feature (^Z) a lot, and sometimes i forget that
i have suspended the pine session, and by mistake instead of typing fg, i type
pine -i and then after a little while it lets me into a READ-ONLY session at the
same time making the previous (suspended) session READ-ONLY too. So I end up
quitting this and the previous session and start pine afresh. Many a times I
tell myself not to repeat this, but it just happens....

Many Thanks...and keep up the *Great* work!!

  Just installed imapd on the server, and tried out PC-Pine 3.91.  It can 
connect to imap just fine, I put in my userid, and my password, but it says 
incorrect password for user.  I've tried just several different user id's and 
passwords, but none of them will work.  Does anyone have any ideas that could 
jump start it?

I've got over 54 messages in Pine 3.89 right now and this is the second time
in a week it's happened.

I rec'd email from A which was cc'd to two other people (there are four 
of us).  I responded to A, and included the same cc list.  I have since 
been getting the A message over and over, a blank message to *me*, and my 
response over and over.  All of this email has the original time of 
sending.  It seems to appear about every 20 minutes or so.

One other person on this list is also getting the repeating email.  The 
other two haven't accessed their mboxes, so we don't know (but I guess we 
can assume here).

The first time it happened, last week, I sent email to X with no cc.  
That same email kept reappearing in my inbox roughly every 20 minutes or 
so.  When X logged on, this stopped.  Out of the clear blue.

We are mystified.  (Forget asking "support" since "support" is one of the 
accounts in this weird loop :-).

Any ideas?

When you type G to go to a folder you can just type the first
part of the folder name and then press the Tab key and Pine will
complete the name (as long as you've given a unique beginning). 
I use this all the time, for example, for my faq-maintainers
folder I just type: faq<Tab>

I'd also like to learn how to do this.  The latest version of the Pine 
FAQ describes another way to use ispell (I think it's by setting the SPELL
environment variable).  If you can do your spell checking that way 
then you can use "pico -w" as your alternate editor.

Let us know if there's any way to have Pico's default be with the -w
flag.  E.g., maybe there's a PICO environment variable...

Any suggestions?  Some setup in Kermit I am missing?

Hi,

I found that pcpine work with the clarkson packet driver. However, when
I try to use the odipkt driver, there is a small problem, I have to
use odipkt 3.0 and in the net.cfg add two lines:

   Link support
        buffers 6 1600

Then pcpine works perfectly!

This feature already exists!  Here's how to perform this amazing feat:
   Go to the configuration screen (main menu M, setup S, config C)
   enable-aggregate-command-set should be checked (on)
   When you are in the news group, press ";" for aggregate command
   Then press "A" for all
   Then "A" to apply an aggregate command
   Then "D" to select delete-all-selected

Cheers !-)

After pine says it printed, pull down the File menu and the choice
"Print Captured Text" should be dark (usable).  Let go on that and it
will run your printer routine with the usual Mac print command window.
Pine can't actually run the printer on a Mac, but it sends the data to
a buffer that the communications application (kermit or whatever) can
control.

I would like to thank those who showed that my suggestion was 
already available.  However, wouldn't it be a bit easier to have a 
single command at the bottom of the screen, rather than all those 
other keystrokes?  I'm looking for simplicity, something that the new 
user could figure out without asking around.

mkpgp is a c-shell script that serves as a pgp interface for Pine.  It 
may also function in a limited fashion with other mail programs that 
provide an alternate editor hook.

  finger slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | pgp -f | tee mkpgp.txt.uu | more

will put mkpgp.txt.uu in your current directory as you read the manual.
                                                       ^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^^
mkpgp is also available by e-mail.  Send blank e-mail to 
slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with
	Subject: mkpgp
to get it.

Send a second message with
	Subject: addtomkpgplist
if you want updates sent you automatically.

This was intended to be purely a user-driven feature.  If user A wishes
to include 8-bit text, he asks the mail agent to let him do so, and the
mail agent obliges.  Any table of "consenting adult partnetrs" is in
the user's head.  To protect naive users, the default action should of
course be to always encode 8-bit text.

Here is a comment from .pinerc:

# To suppress saving of outgoing mail, set: default-fcc=""

And it works.

But since 3.90, the best way to change the configuration is in the 
<S>etup-<C>onfig screen.  To set default-fcc="", move the cursor on 
default-fcc then <D>elete Val if there is something there then 
<A>dd Value and hit <Return> to enter an <Empty value>.

Buried in the IMAP package lies a POP3 server named ipop3d, as well as a 
POP2 server named ipop2d.  The entire IMAP distribution is included with 
Pine.  To find the pop daemon sources, go to the IMAP directory and look 
in ./ANSI/ipopd/ .  Of course, if you're using a NON-ANSI system, look 
there instead.  If you can compile pine, you can compile the pop daemons.

I hope this is the proper place to ask this question.  I was told this 
was a mail list and tried to subscribe.  Haven't seen anything from it 
yet.  

My question:  Is pine supported (has anyone compiled/run it) under Sun 
Solaris?

We have a client that would like to try it but I see no reference to 
Solaris in the source.

TIA

On my wishlist for pine is to change either the ^X or ^C command.  Having
them side by side makes it way too easy to mail something that one assumes
has been cancelled. Sure the prompt provides a check, but it would be more
efficient to have the Send and Cancel commands further apart.

My internet service provider seems reluctant to set up imap on their
system. Can pine be configured to use POP?

I know, I have read the imap-vs-pop document, and agree, but it
is another thing to convince the service providers to use a
program they have never heard of until today.

Thank you Wet-Sprocket and you're right, Ed, I wanted (and still want) to 
have a file of group names.
So comes here Mr. Dieter Britz again with his opinion and asks once more; 
how?

I have a slip/ppp account on tyrell.net and wish to use pine to read
my mail from my Linux system at home. I can send mail out to other
systems fine, but can not open my inbox on my account at tyrell.

Their support people don't know anything about pine or Unix for that
matter. They only seem to know Dos and Windows software. 

When pine starts up I get the following message:
[Opening "INBOX"...]
   then:
[Can't connect to tyrell,143: Connection refused]
[No folder opened]

My ppp connection is fine in all other aspects (ping, telnet,
mosaic, etc...).

My "inbox-path" in .pinerc is set to {tyrell.net}/usr/spool/mail/stevem
which IS where my spooled mail is. 

Any ideas? I think it is a problem at Tyrell. Is it possible that
my pine software is trying to open the wrong port to access the
inbox on tyrell (143?). Or is 143 an error code meaning something
else completely?

One way to verify if the imap server is working is to telnet to the
host on that port number:

telnet tyrell 143 

( or "telnet tyrel imap" is imap is in /etc/services, but yes:
  143 is the default port number. ) 

If you get an answering banner message, you should be able to type
something like:

1 login name password
2 select INBOX 

[ you should see some status info displayed here ] 

3 logout


If you don't get the answering banner from telnet - something like:
* OK elvis.med.Virginia.EDU IMAP2bis Service 7.8(92) at Fri, 9 Dec 1994 19:31:20 -0500 (EST)


Then there's no IMAP server listening on that port. 

[ And if you want to know how to "speak" IMAP to the server, read the 
  RFC's - there's an example session in there somewhere. ]

Never seen that one.  I built it to run on SysV r3.2 v4.2.  What version
of the system do you have?  What style mailboxes are you using?  Do you
have TCP/IP installed?  Does this happen on both user mailboxes and on
root?  Did you get the package from odi.cwc.whecn.edu or ftp.celestial.com
(both sources were mentioned)?  If necessary, I can build it for you with 
debugging turned on, so you can get more information about where it's 
crashing.

Message-Id: <3caevi$7lo@crl5.crl.com>
Status: O
X-Status: 

I am looking for an easy way to keep an Elm alias file up to date with 
Pine's .addressbook. Preferabliy something that would always run at 
logout time (in case I added any nicknames in Pine).

I have seen a script that will do the reverse (alias.text >> 
.addressbook) but not what I'm looking for. I could prbably rewrite it to 
go the other way, but then I only have the alias.text, I still need to 
convert it to the native format for Elm to use. Will the program 
'newaliases' do this? I could call the program at the end of the script.

Any other suggestions or help would be appreciated.

 +   Hm?  Control-X is in the middle of the bottom row; Control-C is to the 
 +   right of the top row of keys.  How much further apart can you get?
 +   (Dvorakists of the world, unite!)

Dvorks still around? Qwerty Rulez!! :)

Both ^X and ^C need command confirmation, make sure you turn them on (if off?)
in case you find yourself in a quandry.

Hi, is there anybody who compiled the pine package on a FreeBSD 2.0
system? I tried "BUILD bsd" but that doesn't work on my system. I'm not
very mush of a unix programmer so looking trough the .c and .h will take
me a lot of time. I'd appriciate any kind of help I can get. In
particular, someboddy sending me files that would make pine compile on
FreeBSD 2.0 would make me very very happy :-).

Thanks

P.S. Once I have the solution, I will post it here for other souls in need
of help (is-there a pine FAQ?).

Pine looks up a file called ".newsrc" in your home dir. for newsgroups
subscription info. Just rename that file, and start Pine to read news
again. This time it will create a fresh ".newsrc", subscribe then to
those groups of your choice.

% mv .newsrc .oldnewsrc

On the other hand, you can by using your favourite editor manually edit this
file to include only those groups that you want to be subscribed to which
probably is a better solution as it reduces the effort in re-subscrption.

 +   Is it possible to shell from Pine (as one might in nn with "!")? Thanx 
 +   for your response in advance.

You can use the ^Z(suspend) or |(pipe) feature instead of !(shell out) to get
back into shell or execute a shell command within Pine (for ex: finger) as it
really depends on what you want to do when you shell out. You can always get
back into Pine by typing 'fg' at the prompt.

In order to use the ^Z feature you will have to enable suspend feature in the
feature list or invoke pine with the -z flag.

Hm?  Control-X is in the middle of the bottom row; Control-C is to the 
right of the top row of keys.  How much further apart can you get?

	When "she took a college course"?  Does that mean you want to
have the respondents limited to female college graduates?  :-) :-)

	Well most programs rely on a parameter or setting to define
the file to be used as the "signature" source.  What you can do is
define it as .pinesig within pine and .elmsig within elm and .whateversig
in whatever.

	Yes, I'm very familiar with punch cards.  50% isn't bad.

I have found out that my internet service provider, Tyrell, is not

choice until this month, a new service provider! They HAVE to 
know more than the support staff at Tyrell. Hell, I know more

Its pretty bad when an end user/subscriber has to tell them how
to fix their system!

	OH....you said "for someone...."  I knew that since I've
 been living outside of the US for so long my grammer was starting to
suffer.....but I didn't know it was having an effect on my ability
to read!!  Oh, well maybe the fact that I'm familiar with punch cards
is also a good excuse....   No?  Fine...I'm going back to watch tapes

Could be your terminal program.  Using QuickLink II for DOS from home, 
Pine succeeds in printing the first and last 20 lines of any given 
message (more or less).  Using Procomm (any of several versions for DOS 
and Windows), printing works perfectly.  You might also, if you are 
dialed in instead of telnetting, check your flow control.  Printing 
causes a seriously dense stream of data to come over the line.  If your 
machine overflows its buffers and can't stop the data flow, you'll get 
garbage too.

But I doubt it's Pine's fault.

Hi all,
Recently, I downloaded a big file from a server somewhere and found that 
it was transfered in the binary mode automatically without me telling it 
to do.  When I come back to my computer, I can't read such a file via any 
word processor application.

On the other hand, ten minutes ago, I donwloaded a file which was 
supposed to be a binary file, but my computer set itself to a text mode.  
I understand that it was because there was some text message before and 
after : which my communication software interpretted that it should then 
be a text file.  How could I solve all of these problem?

One more questions.  Could I view the first page of a long message and 
then jump accross hundreds of pages to the last page of such a long file 
while in the pine mode?  There isn't any keyboard command for that 
function that I know of.

Any help on this matter will be greatly appreciated.  Please direct your 
answer to my e-mail in addition to this news group as I rrarely come into 
this group.

Best regards,

Thian.

I have a script that goes both ways.  Two potential problems for you:  

(1) It was written some time ago, when I was using pine 3.87 and an
earlier version of elm - sorry I don't remember the elm version. 
Therefore, if the formats have changed then the script may be obsolete.  I
have not used this script recently. 

(2) It is written in uniRexx, which is a wonderful language, but
unfortuantely not commonly available in the Unix world because it costs
extra $ and duplicates functionality of Unix shell languages, though in my
opinion Rexx is more elegant; Rexx is a scripting language.  But the real
advantage of Res is that works on many platforms, including IBM mainframes
of several types, DOS, OS/2 (it is part of OS/2), Amiga, numerous Unix
versions, and I now hear there will be an NT version.  I think IBM now 
sells a version of Rexx specific to AIX (in addition to the 
multi-platform Unix commercial product).

Alexander et al:
Let me reinforce what Gunther said:  I think 99% of "pine printing 
problems" are either due to communications software that doesn't 
understand ANSI escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin 
case) flow control problems.

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

If others have additional specific printing problems and solutions, it 
would be good to contribute them for incorporation into a "pine printing 
faq"...  (Nancy, what d'ya think?)

If nn is on your system you can use the following:

Type...                In order to...

nngrep -a |less        Use less to view list of all newsgroups at your site
nngrep -a > print.me   Put the list of all newsgroups in file named print.me


There should be a file on your system that contains a list of all newsgroups 
that your site receives, with a short description for many of the newsgroups.
This file is in different places on different machines so you should ask your 
system administrator where it is on your machine (make sure you mention the 
descriptions otherwise s/he might point you to a file named active which is
not nearly as useful as the file with descriptions).  I have the master list 
accessible from my Internet Web page <URL:http://www.jazzie.com/internet/> - 
it has around 9900 newsgroups in it!

Good luck,
Nancy

There is a bug in Pine 3.91 that causes certain variables in pine.conf and
pine.conf.fixed to be ignored.  A diff to correct this in pine.init.c is
attached.

Not quite correct.  The pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed files both set
variables for all users in each session.  The difference is that pine.conf
can be overridden by each user, but pine.conf.fixed cannot.

Hi,

I have a UNIX shell account which I dial up from a '386 running DOS (no 
Windows :)).  Our privider has Pine 3.87 installed.  Is there anyway to 
have Pine 3.91 reside in a shell account?  Or will this cause conflicts 
on the UNIX host?

Cheers,
Ngaire

Pine currently only adds a newsgroup when it needs to save some information
about it, i.e. subscribed, messages read.

It is on the list, but I don't have any guess as to what version it will make

The whole purpose of the newalais command is to update Elm native formats by

i forgot to mention that i am interseted in setting to another 7-bit
charset, since i believe the default character setting in pine's setup
is only invoked when the text is 8-bit.

    That's funny, the kezboards, oops, keyboards I'll be pounding on in a

    This is a problem; whereas old Pines (like 3.07) would tag all text with
the selected charset whether 7 or 8-bit, if it were not one of a limited
set (ISO-8859-* and such), permitting one to use charset=EBCDIC-US with
7-bit mail, the more recent Pines will assume you are using a MIME charset
which is a superset of US-ASCII, and label the text with  the lowest
possible charset, meaning ASCII if only 7-bit text is included.
    Note  that the permitted MIME charsets are listed in the latest Assigned
Numbers RFC, which I believe is RFC 1700 (even I haven't browsed this yet),
but to my knowledge, all the charsets listed in RFC 1345 are allowed, while
perhaps not recommended.  This does include a number of charsets which are
decidedly not supersets of US-ASCII.
    If your desired character set is not listed, you should use a non-
standard character set with a prefix of ``X-'' as in
charset=X-I-HAVE-NO-IDEA
or else work to getting your charset registered if you feel a need.

    But the problem is that Pine assumes that if you have no characters
outside the range of ASCII (>127 decimal), that your message is equivalent
to US-ASCII, to permit use of  charsets  Pine doesn't know  of, without
unnecessarily tagging ASCII as something else (read the MIME RFC).

    Perhaps the option could be provided for expert users that the given
charset value is not a superset of US-ASCII, which then tags  all messages
with the value provided, which would then correctly tag messages you would
be sending, as well as permit  proper tagging of West European variants of
ASCII,  which assign other characters to the positions occupied by { and \
and } and the like in US-ASCII (yeah, that's a poor example, since all the
characters would be included in ISO-8859-1, but I'm sure there will still
be those who can't quite upgrade their terminals immediately, and for whom
such tagging would be useful, if the recipient has a MIME reader capable
of doing translation from the charset in transport to the display charset).

    The short answer is, as far as I can tell, Pine will always give a
message consisting of only 7-bit data the charset tagging of US-ASCII in
the recent releases, but I can see it being useful to allow the user to
choose to apply a different tagging to 7-bit data.

OK....

	Well, as an amateur the first question you should ask is....."Where
is the FAQ?".

	It can be found at ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pine/docs.

	As for a signature.  Couple of simple steps for a simple signature.

1.	Create a file in your home directory with any name you choose.
	(Many people like .sig as the file name.)

2.	Edit that to be the signature that you wish.  Remember the
	old saying...."Short is best."

3.	Go to the pine configuration screens and edit the line:

	signature-file=~/.signature

	You're done...

 +   	While the method you describe does *show* all the groups on the

Ask the local News Admin. to keep a "full blown" sample newsrc file in
/usr/local/sample. Users can copy that file to a local .newsrc file which
can be edited/viewed/printed/taken home...

Comes here Mr/Mz. nefarious hoyden with this opinion in  "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on Fri, 09 Dec 1994 11:44:51 -0600:

 +   is there an easy way to transfer an entire mail folder onto a disk or hard
 +   drive?

Pine saves mail in a mail folder which is nothing but a regular text file.
You can cd into the mail dir. and then can download these files themselves
and can be viewed by any PC/Mac text editor.

 +   how do i access the newsgroups through pine?  do you prefer it to nn?

In the (M)ain/(S)etup/(C)onfig screen set the nntp-server option to the 
newsserver's address at your site. Try reading the Release Notes which
gives you an in-depth info on this.

Comes here Mr. Monthian Buntan - OR99 with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 8 Dec 1994 11:35:20 GMT:

 +   One more questions.  Could I view the first page of a long message and 
 +   then jump accross hundreds of pages to the last page of such a long file 
 +   while in the pine mode?  There isn't any keyboard command for that 
 +   function that I know of.

If your system has newer version of Pine(3.9*), you can first use the W key
then ^V for the last line.

Regarding other (Pine unrelated) questions please forward to appropriate
newsgroups.

	That will work, except in the case where the person asking *is*
the administrator of their own system.

	I suppose the real point is...you can't do with pine what the
original poster was asking.  At least not yet, my understanding is that
it is on the list of things to do.

I'm using Pine 3.91, and I've chosen to use an alternate editor (vi) instead
of Pico.  This works well.  But, because Pine's spell check feature is
built into the Pico editor, I can't easily spell check my messages from
within Pine. I do have access to the ispell program, which will allow
me to spell check a specified file.  Does anyone have a suggestion as to
how I can integrate ispell into Pine or vi so that I can easily spell check
my messages without having to leave Pine?

Thanks for any info.

Yup.  Here's how the 'E' flag works with the Solaris /bin/mail
program.  It's the default local delivery agent, and when the 'E' flag
is not used...

flyer; egrep '^Mlocal' /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
Mlocal,         P=/bin/mail, F=lsDFMfSn, S=10, R=20/40,
flyer; echo 'From me to you' | mailx -s test1 jdavis
flyer; cat /var/mail/jdavis
 [...]
 Content-Length:15

 From me to you

...the 'From' is not escaped.  Now if I add the 'E' flag,

flyer; egrep '^Mlocal' /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
Mlocal,         P=/bin/mail, F=lsDFMfSnE, S=10, R=20/40,
                                       ^

flyer; echo 'From me to you' | mailx -s test2 jdavis
flyer; cat /var/mail/jdavis
 [...]
 Content-Length: 16

 >From me to you

then /bin/mail escapes the 'From' _and_ recalculates the
'Content-Length' header.  So programs that look for 'From' should work
as well as programs that look for the Content-Length header.

Here's an excerpt of my Signature and Finger FAQ which I'll be posting real 
soon now.  To have a signature that's used only by Pine name it something
like .sig.pine and then specify that in the signature-file variable.

Let me know if you have suggestions for improving these instructions,
Nancy

 Followup-To: comp.mail.pine
 
 Pine automatically appends ~/.signature (if it exists) to your messages.  
 To change Pine's signature features:
 
 1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
 2. Type c for Configuration
 3. To change the value of the signature-at-bottom feature:
    a) Spacebar and arrow down to the signature-at-bottom variable
    b) Type x to set/unset this variable.
 4. To change the name of your signature file:
    a) Arrow down to the signature-file line
    b) Type c for Change Value
    c) Type the path and name of the file you want to use for your
       signature.  Note that ~ can be used for your $HOME directory.

 Followup-To: comp.mail.pine
 
 Pine automatically appends ~/.signature (if it exists) to your messages.  
 To change Pine's signature features in Pine 3.89 (and earlier versions) you 
 need to edit your ~/.pinerc file directly.
 
 Type...                 In order to...

 cd                      Change to your home directory (i.e., $HOME or ~)
 pico .pinerc            Use the pico editor to edit your .pinerc file.
 ^w                      Search for . . .
 feature-list            . . . ``feature-list''
 
 
 Edit your .pinerc so that it contains this line:
 
 feature-list=signature-at-bottom
 
 If you want more than one feature in your feature-list then they need to
 be comma separated like this:
 
 feature-list=old-growth,
 	signature-at-bottom
 
 
 If you want to use a file other than ~/.signature for your signature
 edit the following line:
 
 signature-file=

Our sendit tool is smart enough not to escape ``From me to you'' lines; 
it does a syntax check and only escapes those lines that Pine would 
consider to be mail delimiter lines.

Best of both worlds!

Thanks for your assistance with the imap problem. I have found out
that my service provider is not running imapd at all. In fact the
person I talked to had not even heard of it! Can pine be made to
use POP instead of IMAP? (I know, IMAP is WAY better, but I don't
think I can get them to run it).

After the command kill -HUP <inetd proces>  i tried to connect with 'telnet

Changing the port number to 109 gives the same result.
Chamgeing the port number to 109 and imap to pop-2 as well in /etc/services as

How can I resolve the problem?

Here is an extract from a document I wrote:

: 6.  Configuring Pine using the "Config Screen"
:  
: In previous versions of Pine, you had to alter the .pinerc file if you
: wanted to configure Pine.  In Pine 3.90, you can configure Pine by
: going to the Setup Configuration Screen (which is called the "Config
: Screen" in this document).  To find this screen, go to the Main Menu,
: press S followed by C.
:  
: You can use the Config Screen to change the settings of some of Pine's
: variables.  If you are uncertain as to the purpose of a variable (or a
: value), move the cursor so that the appropriate line of the Config
: Screen is highlighted, and press ? (for Help).  Any changes that you
: make to the Config Screen will eventually be written to your .pinerc
: file.  For many changes, the change that you want will be effected
: immediately: however, for other changes you will need to leave Pine
: and then re-start it.
: 
: 10. Supplying your own headers
:

True, but on my keyboard, the Dvorak (Standard layout, not Microsoft's):
`1234567890]=   ~!@#$%^&*()[+
',.pyfgcrl/}\   "<>PYFGCRL?{|
aoeuidhtns-     AOEUIDHTNS_
;qjkxbmwvz      :QJKXBMWVZ
(unshifted)       (shifted)

The X and the C are comfortably far away.

I'm just trying to make a point about developers who write keybindings 
based on the layout of the QWERTY keyboard, rather than on mnemonics.  It 
makes things damn annoying for those of us who use nonstandard input 
methods.

Can you imagine what a person using a chorded keyboard must go through in
applications that eschew arrow keys in favor of "i,j,k,m"?  "Hm...to move 
up a line, press the third key and second keys simultaneously.  To move 
down, key 1, 3, and 4.  Right, 2, 3, and 4.  Left, 1 and 3."

That would be maddening!  Developers need to stop assuming everyone uses 
QWERTY.  In this age of carpal-tunnel strain, more and more of us are 
not.

I'd REALLY like to see a patch, hack, or feature in Pine to allow
From: selection after sending. That is, after I hit control-x, I'd like
to be presented with a menu of From:'s, from which I select one and hit
return for the default. i.e., so I can email as my username or as group 
mananger without having multiple .pinerc's and quiting each time, or 
editing the From: header manually each time.

Does anyone have time to program something like is in? Bribes are 
available. :)

 I am pretty new with PINE, I have installed it on my workstation at the 
univ. and I'd like to use it also at home on my PC. I wonder if I can run 
a PC version of pine without any network support. That is, I'd like to 
do the following:

1) download the "/usr/spool/mail/..." file from the university;

2) hangup the communication  

3) read my e-mails in a relaxed way with no stress about keeping the phone
line busy and spending money for long-distance (when far from home) calls


 Furthermore, a more challenging scenario continues as:

4) answer to my e-mails, still from home on my PC, postponing the answers 
instead of sending right away

5) connect again to the university

6) upload the 'postponed' answers (the correspondent file)

7) automatically send all of those


I have download some PC versions and tried those, they always look for the
network sw being installed, some versions do not run at all, others run but
with a bunch of error messages being produced. However, when I try to compose
my answers PC-pine does not allow me to compose any reply with no network sw
installed. I think the solution to all that is just to have a version of
PC-pine which allows only reading e-mails from a file in the INBOX format
located in a specific directory, then compose answers to those by only
postponing the replies. Basically, all network concern should be shut off. 

  This would allow a full-automatic system to trasnfer e-mails from univ. to
home in batch, prepare the answers and send'em back (maybe still 
using another automatic mechanism).

  Any help would be appreciated...

 Giovanni

Thanks for the help but the document that you sent me really doesn't 
answer my question.  I would like to know if I could configure the header 
when I am reading my mail and not composing mail.

Are there any Windows (3.11 or NT 3.5) based IMAP clients out there?  
Preferrably something that does not run in a DOS session.  I know about 
PCPine, but was wondering if there was something more graphical available.

I have Pine set-up to read other incoming message folders aside from my 
INBOX. I use filter, the one that comes with elm, to filter mail. 
Everythings works great, but is there a way to have Pine automatically 
move read messages from one of my alternate INBOXes to my mbox? I have 
found nothing in the docs to do this. It is just a small problem. I can 
always use the save command, but it just adds another step.

Thanx,

Hi

I would like to suggest to implement PGP in pine in the future, since 
getting files an messages in and out of pine in order to encrypt and 
decrypt them, is irritating.

I do understand very well if it is not implemented, cause that might not 
be easy at all, so take this mail as it is :  Only a suggestion.

I am running Wyse60-type terminals on a Unix system and function key mode

The control sequences that my function keys produce are:

<F1> = ^a @ ^m
<F2> = ^a A ^m
<F3> = ^a B ^m

Ring any bells?

Hi,

	Could someone please tell me if there is a way to strip the header
lines from messages in a folder without having to do it manually?  I am
using filter in conjunction with my mailing list to create a digest, but
huge headers on the digest mail-out are unsightly and unnecessary.  All I
need is From:, Date: and Subject:.  Can anyone help?

I asked a similar question earlier, and the reply was:

"Key codes are hard-coded - pine doesn't use terminfo or termcap"

 :(

If I'm wrong, I would love it if someone would correct me.

One way you can find out about new newsgroups at your site is to put
display the last ~10 lines of the active file each time you log in.
The active file tracks newsgroups that your site receives and new
newsgroups are appended to the bottom of it.  Here at my site I'd
put this in my .login:

  tail -10 /news/newslib/active

The active file is in different directories at different sites so
you might want to ask your sys admin where it is at your site.

Hope this helps,
Nancy

	One thing to look at, make sure that the seperator in your inetd.conf
file are tab characeters and *not* spaces.

	However, in the case where all of your news access is via
NNTP, the file may not even be on your system.

Subject: Re: Content-Type of application/pgp

After several discussions over the last few weeks -- with Phil
Zimmerman, Jim Galvin, Ned Freed, and others at Email World and IETF --
I have reached the conclusion that the application/pgp type should be
ABANDONED in favor of an approach based on multipart/security.   My
application/pgp Internet Draft is expiring shortly & will not be
renewed.  By using multipart/security, we can work towards a greater
level of harmony between the PEM and PGP communities.  It also now
appears that there's a chance that PEM and PGP keys can be made
interoperable, which would be a huge win.

I don't want anyone to think I'm standing in the way of this
convergence, so I wanted to publicly state that I have abandoned my
application/pgp Internet Draft.

What we need now is for someone to work up a new draft on how to use PGP
inside of multipart/security.  I'm swamped.  Any volunteers?  --

I've compiled Pine on a BDSi machine using build bsd, and it works
great, except that everytime it goes to lock a file is returns a

It does complete all its operations despite the problem, but it is still 
annoying.

Any ideas on how to fix this, or how to comment out locking altogether?

	Builds fine on 2.3.  A few things to watch out for:

1.	Do not include /usr/ucblib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment.

2.	If you are using the SUN c compiler....make sure that your cc
	is set to /usr/pkgs/SPARCWorks/SUNWspro/bin/cc or whatever....and
	*not* /usr/ucb/cc.

3.	In the pine source directory, edit the makefile.sol to change the
	CFLAGS line to include -Dconst=.

4.	Then use build sol to build.

For new users I think Pine is a great way to get started 
participating in news.  But if you read and participate in 
a lot of newsgroups then you'll probably want to move on
to a newsreader like nn.  Here are some features that nn has 
that Pine doesn't have:

* consolidated menu i.e., lists each subject only once on menu
* can choose multiple subjects and then go into reading mode
  and read all the articles you've selected
* can kill a subject or an author
* can have a subject auto-selected
* nn's philosophy is "no news is good news" and so when you
  move to another newsgroup it automatically marks the current
  newsgroup as read.  (You can change this behaviour if you don't
  like it; also it's easy to get back to articles marked read)
* macros
* key remapping
* can pre-specify default save folder for each newsgroup you read
* incredibly customizable, e.g., about how new newsgroups are treated
  
There are lots more great things about nn.

  -Nancy

I suspect this has been asked and answered a jillion times, but ...

I'm fairly new to Pine (using 3.90). My access to it, and to Internet, is 
through the office. Unfortunately, the system administrator is on 
vacation, but I don't have the luxury of waiting for her return.

Simple question: Can someone send me an e-mail message with a file 
attached? If so, how do I access it?

I await any answers. Thanks!

The config files have no variables set except the news-collection

Easy. Dummy up the group name with your own address for the "To:"line. 
Then get the rich header (with ^R 3.89) on and put the group add in the
"Bcc:"  Voila, no more scrolling past a whole bunch of names to get to the
message!

Hi,

On mango.rsmas.miami.edu, directory ~ftp/pub/palm, file palm.shar.gz, I have
placed a copy of my mail program written in Tcl/Tk, palm. palm uses the
c-client library of Mark Crispin to handle mailbox interactions. palm uses
the exmh-1.5.1 MIME display and composition routines.

You'll need to build the c-client library available from ftp.cac.washington.edu
and the BLT library available from alcatel. I've tested it with Tcl7.3/Tk 3.6.

If you use pine, that's good. palm tries to feel similar to pine. This
version doesn't have the new functionality that has been added to pine 3.91.
There's a way to read news but it is really, really clunky. One can't
post and news reading might be yanked out soon. News modes was simple
to add with the c-client routines.

The Help menu is somewhat lame but it's better than nothing. Haven't quite
decided how to do it right.

I run on DEC Alpha's running OSF/1 and I have a Linux laptop. This is
the extend of my testing. I welcome reports, good or bad.

SNIP!
Tyrell now has imapd running and I am using it now. Looks like it is
working ok. Much better and easier than POP. You still have to have
a POP/IMAP/FTP password to use it. When you start up pine it asks
for your password and then opens your inbox on tyrell.net. I have
been using pine to read news also.

Are you spooling the news on your machine with a full time ppp connection
or doing it on demand?

-------------


Over the last 6-9 months, we've been seeing more requests for the latest
in technology than for anything else.  In particular, while we see the
occasional request for pine and the like, we see 3-4 times as many
requests for network-based services such as SLIP/PPP, POP, NNTP and the
like.  We see these requests both from internal XXXXXX folk as well as
YYYYYY users. At the same time, due to security-related incidences there
has been a marked increase in concern on security-related matters. 
Because of user requests our direction has been set toward network-based
services.  Because of concern over security (and the recognition that many
network-based services require the use of the password which would pass
over the network in the clear), our efforts have been most recently based
in building a security service (library) which could be used by many if
not most of the network-based services.  To that end, we have
intentionally slowed the depolyment of any service which requires a
password since immediate deployment would add one more place where the
vulnurability of passwords passing over the network in the clear would
occur. 

For instance, to meet the goals above, we've decided to move to zmail, a
network-based GUI mail system based upon the POP protocols (but to move
toward IMAP soon).  Since POP requires the use of the password, it is
waiting upon the completion of the security library.  While in principle I
haven't any objection to pine in the short run, I wouldn't want to be put
in a position that if we bring pine up today, we're going to be willing to
support it in, say, 4 months.  Even though pine can be configured to use
POP, I know of no one willing to put in the work to make it IMAP
compliant.  

[I thought that pine *was* IMAP-compliant. --pjh]

Further, given that XXXXXX has chosen to move to zmail, I wouldn't want to
be responsible for adding the necessary security calls into pine which
would let it be compatible with our sense of security. This would mean
essentially that when we turn on the new zmail based system, pine would
break.  Is this acceptable? 

[Can anyone comment on pine's lack of security, vis-a-vis ZMAIL? --pjh]

There are several freely available versions of the DES encryption code
available via ftp from sites outside the US (it is illegal to export this
code from the US). You might try  ftp.mcc.ac.uk  in  /pub/misc-unix  or
try   archie crypt   to find other sites. Most of these packages have
the crypt() and encrypt() functions which are compatible replacements
for the regular OS versions.

There is TCP/IP for OS/2 and gcc. Pine could be the first (and
only) Mailer on OS/2 for imapd. I would be very happy with
an text-only version of Pine for OS/2.

    I guess I'll have to post this after all.  I tried using the above
  address and my e-mail bounced.

 
     I'm mailing but not posting this, because my impression is that such
  questions are beneath the notice of the people in this group.  But my
  experience is much less than theirs, more like yours (I presume), so *my*
  impressions and directions might conceivably be more relevant to your
  needs than those of a net guru who can't really remember how *unobvious*
  it all is at first.

     I noticed when I was reading the group a little bit ago that someone
  has already answered your post and is touting nn.  I've used nn and
  will likely do so more frequently in the future, but right now I prefer
  pine, particularly when I'm reading my primary newsgroup, which is
  alt.astrology.  What I *don't* like about nn is precisely what endears
  it to its fans, the fact that it gets rid of stuff as you scan and
  thus allows you to cover more ground in less time.  I finally figured
  out that if I'm looking at a menu page listing articles and hit the
  spacebar to go to the next page, the articles I passed over when I hit
  the spacebar to look at the next page will not be there the next time
  I invoke nn because of the auto-junk-seen default variable.  Now I
  enter a colon to bring up the command line right after I've hit <ret>
  to accept the first group nn presents me with on entry, and then I set
  that variable to off.  Thus: <:set auto-junk-seen off> <ret>.  But so far
  I haven't figured out how to keep it from reverting back to the original
  setting between sessions, so I have to do it over each time.  To make
  a long story short, when I first started using nn I inadvertently wiped
  out a lot of messages I would have liked to look at, and I'm still a
  little nervous about accidentally screwing things up when I'm using nn.  
  For that reason, if I finish a newsgroup and alt.astrology comes up 
  next, I immediately hit shift-q (i.e. capital Q) so as to exit and get 
  the hell out of Dodge, because if I inadvertently get rid of messages 
  they'll also be missing when I try to read alt.astrology from pine.

     I like pine because it's much more user-friendly, even if much more
  cumbersome and inefficient, than nn.  If you want something deleted you
  have to actually delete it, otherwise it'll stay there until its time
  is up.  That's fine with me when I'm reading my three favorite newsgroups
  (alt.astrology, soc.history.science, comp.mail.pine) because I like to
  glance at the first "page" of each message in those groups before hitting
  <d> for delete or <s> for save.  When you check each and every message,
  however briefly, to be sure you aren't missing anything that *might* be
  interesting or relevant, pine is as fast as nn.  If it's a less relevant
  newsgroup and you're just glancing through, nn is much faster.

     Okay, here's what I do when I read news.  When I'm in the main menu
  I hit <M> for Mail.  Once I get the pine menu screen I hit <L> for
  Folder List.  I then get a screen that looks like this:


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder-collection <Mail/[]>     			           (Local)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
               
                [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
News-collection <News>                                             (Local)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]



     In my system, at least, the top "select here" is highlighted.  I then
  hit either the down arrow or <N> for next and it highlights the second
  one.  Then I hit <V> for view and it lists the newsgroups I'm subscribed
  to, with the first one highlighted.  Here's what my screen looks like:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------     
                           details omitted
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                              likewise
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
News-collection <News> 						    (Local)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

alt.astrology           soc.history.science     sci.astro
alt.anthropology        soc.anthropology.paleo  soc.history
sci.history.moderated   efn.questions           comp.mail.pine


    I hit <V> again, pine opens alt.astrology, and I start reading.  There
  are ways to speed things up if you come home from a two-day trip, as I
  just did, and find 305 messages in one newsgroup and over 400 in another.
  There are also ways to configure pine that makes it work better for my
  purposes.  If this is helpful and you have more questions, I'll be happy
  to explain further.  Basically, I'm giving you the kind of help I would
  have liked someone to give me three months ago, or at least I hope I
  am.  Hope you're having as much fun with this stuff as I am.

						  - Dale Huckeby
				                    (dale@efn.org)

  p.s. Just like the gurus I just overlooked the obvious.  I think when you
  first enter News you'll be subscribed to every newsgroup under the sun.
  You can delete them all by hand, but it seems to me I wiped them all out
  and then added the groups I wanted by hitting <A> for Subscribe.  When
  you do that pine prompts you for the name of the group, you type it out
  and hit <ret>, and it appears on your screen.  

     Or I might have hit <F> from the main menu (not pine) to go to File
  Maintenance.  (I just now tried it out, after writing the above sentence,
  and I think that's what I did when I first started, when I was still
  using nn and hadn't yet realized I could read news in pine.)  After you
  hit <F> and are in the File Maintenance menu, hit <E> for Edit and when
  you're prompted for the name of the file type <.newsrc>.  What you'll
  see is a long list of newsgroups.  Each will have a colon after the name
  of the newsgroup, which means it's subscribed.  You want to change it
  to a <!> to indicate that it's unsubscribed.  I think you can unsubscribe
  everything at once and then go back and put <:> next to the ones you
  want to subscribe, but as I recall I simply erased all the ones I didn't
  want.  

    If you have problems with any of the above I'll experiment around and
  see what I can come up with.  Finally, if I've underestimated your level
  of experience and spelled things out in excessive detail, I apologize.
  I don't want to insult your intelligence, but I remember how *un*obvious
  things were for me three months ago and how irritated I got when some
  nerd would tell me to "go to your init file and . . ."  "So how do I get
  to my init file?" I wanted to say.  "Do I hafta catch a goddamned cab,
  or what?  Please don't ASSUME I know what you mean" . . . and I've tried
  not to with you.

Hi:
Anyone know how to construct nested folders,
i.e. folders inside folders?
Is it at all possible with Pine?
I use Pine 3.91.
Thanks, Byrg

You are gonna like this: there's a faq in the making which completely lists
*all* the newsgroups and some relevant info about each newsgroup at:

       ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/usenet-b/report/abbreviated.txt

Check it out. Enjoy! Full credit goes to the FAQ maintainer. :)

Isin't there a specific newsgroup which lists all new newsgroups?
              news.announce.newgroups

Just subscribe to it....and read the periodic faq posted in that group.

Would it be possible to include a sample ".newsrc" which has all the basic
news.*.group newsgroups listed in it in future releases?

Ofcourse an option should be there for such users who already have a 
customized ".newsrc" avail. if they want to use that.

Do you mean remote folders on a host that you know about?  If so,
edit your .pinerc so it contains lines like these:

incoming-folders={stein.u.washington.edu}inbox

folder-collections={stein.u.washington.edu}Folders/[],
	*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/[]

When you start Pine you will be prompted for a userID and password
for any non-anonymous hosts.  The Folders directory is relative to
the home directory of the userID you give.

When you go into Pine's folder list (with the L command) you'll see 
all the folders.  I think it's nicest if you set expanded-view-of-folders.

Does anyone know what an * before a folder collection means?
I tried it without it and it doesn't work.  It shows up in the
folder list (Pine's L command) as a "News-collection".

Also, does anyone know what else can be used other than anonymous
after "host.name/" - I tried to specify my userid but that didn't
work.  Is there a way to pre-specify your userid?

Thanks for any info,
Nancy

PS - I love IMAP!!!

I don't know if the this is the correct place to send this but as it

I am running Pine 3.91 on a Linux machine which is running sendmail v 
8.6.9.  I have set up sendmail so that outgoing mail from myself is 
aliased to Stuart.Tares@lhr-sys.bru-ro.DHL.COM as can be seen from the below:

Test 2


Pine is sending the outgoing mail down to sendmail but it does not appear 
to be doing the name aliasing.  As it is the same sendmail either way, I 
don't know what the problem is.

If anyone had any ideas, I would be very grateful.

Thanks and Regards

One of my users has reported some problems with the character set 
available in folder names:

1. $ and #
Using A(dd folder) in the folders menu, it is possible to create folders 
with $ and #, and they can be saved to without problems. It is not 
however permitted to quote them in the Fcc: field (Pine beeps).

2. Upper and lower case

On a unix system it is possible to create folders with names in either
case, for example ABC and abc, and these are distinct folders (different
files on unix). However, L(ist folders) will only show one of them (the 
one in capitals). 

Both these seem to me to be bugs.

Subject: Custom header problem 

I'm sure this is not new but some only seem to work for news but not mail.
It _appears_ that I can define the use of a field such as Reply-To: and 
fill in a value on a per mail item basis. Rich headers displays the field 
but pine seems to lose it if I use the direct SMTP or sendmail interfaces.
My organization field seems OK and Reply-To: is fine with the nntp
interface.

Thanks.

Hello --
I've gotten pine3.91.tar.Z from the server at ftp.cac.washington.edu and 
have gotten the message "corrupt input" when I try to uncompress it.

I've gotten it and tried to uncompress a number of times, and always get 
the same message.  Has anyone else had the same problem??

I started getting a Cross Device error when I open my pine 3.91 session

fine) are being created in /usr/tmp. Sometimes I've had two session open 
in the past but other than the read permissions being shifted I've not 
noticed a problem.

Also, if I type an alias now before the system retrieves it I get a quick 
/usr/tmp/aXXXXX doesn't exit error at screen bottom, then the true 
address for the alias appears.

Can't think of anything I've done differently, no one else is getting 
these errors. Any ideas?

I hope this message is directed to the proper place.  If not would you 
please forward or advise me where it should go.

Background.

I am at the UNiversity of Md. and use pine as my communications (mail) 
package.  I currently go thru procomm to access pine.  I have not been 
able to understand how to download graphics files over the net.  I have 
tried over and over to get an explanation with one of two results.  
Either the people don't know how or they are so wrapped up in computers 
that they cannot explain how to do anything to anyone else except another 
computer jock.  Notice my frustration here?

Could someone please tell me how to access these files.  What software do 
I need for encoding/unencoding or whatever that is.  Where can I obtain 
it.  I understand it is available via the net but do not know how to 
download those files either.  And once I have the proper software how the 
hell do I use it?  NOtice the frustration here again?

I know I have probable sent an uproar of laughter around the computer 
inner sanctum at UW but once you stop laughing do you think someone would 
help?  Thanks

I am looking for a faster solution to access news remotely. I prefer tin
as a news reader (or rtin) but it is very slow when I use rtin from my
machine over PPP. Pine is pretty fast starting up, but takes about 15-20
seconds for each page of article titles, not to mention that it does
not thread the articles. I might try nn-nntp but I never did like
the interface much. Maybe if I took the time to learn the commands I
might feel differently about nn. But I prefer a threaded news reader.
Especially for high-traffic news groups. 

Thanks for your suggestions!

can one of you experts give me a short synopsis of the changes i need
to make to my .pinerc to use pine with mh-style folders (folders are
directories and messages are individual files)?

also, what is the magic thing that makes a file a *pine* folder? is
there some invisible character at the beginning of the file and
between messages or something?

i'd prefer email replies (i'll summarize back to the group). thanks.

Not yet, but we plan to have a way to do that in a future release.

Right now the only keywords allowed after the host name are protocol 
specifiers (e.g. nntp, imap), and anonymous.  IMAP is the default, but if 
you explicitly set it, Pine will not try to connect to the server via rsh
(for pre-authentication purposes.)

hi,
	
	I am looking for a public "autoresponder" program.

This should generate, an automatic reply, Acknowledging, a mail sent to a
particular address. ( with a standard reply from file)

That would be my first requirement.

Next, if possible, I would also like this program, to scan for a couple
of keywords, in the Subject line, and mail out to that person, the files,
I have specfied beforehand, with those keywords.

If such a script/code exsists for a mailtool such as elm/pine, do drop me
a note.

If such a program exsists for any other mail utilities (Unix based),
kindly pass on the source.

	If you have such a program operational and could pass it along
or point me to a source for the same, it would be great.

Thanks in advance for any info,

Venkat

Yes, such a program does exist, and it's called procmail.  An archie search
should point you in the right direction.

	I am having a major problem with Pine3.91. It will not send mail for me. 
I can use Pine3.89 without any problems, but 3.91 just will not work. I am using
a Linux (unix) system with sendmail installed.

	First off when I start pine I get this message:

	[Error saving configuration in file "/root/.pinerc": Invalid argument] 

	Then the main screen will come up and everything seems to be fine, but when I
try to compose a message and type ^X to send I get this message:

	[Can't write temp file for sending: Unknown error]
I am at a loss. I have checked my permissions and they seem to be fine. But just in case 
here they are:
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root         7725 Dec 14 01:03 .pinerc
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       122207 Oct 30 14:17 pico*
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1421940 Oct 30 14:17 pine*

        I don't know what to do from here. I have reinstalled pine several times with the
same results. If anyone could give me some help I would really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

Some questions for you:

1.	Are you using pine?  The headers of your email don't indicate it.

2.	If you are using pine....what version?

3.	You put the .signature in the root (/) directory?  Why don't
	you simply place it in your $HOME directory?

4.	The "sig on option"??  In the pine setup menu (pine 3.9X) you
	simply set the "signature-file         =" parameter to the
	name of your signature file.

	e.g.

	signature-file         = $HOME/.mysig

Andre,

I too am running Linux and sendmail and have managed to get Pine 3.91 
working without any great problems.  I don't know what the problems with 
.pinerc is but the most likely problem with your inability to send mail 
is incorrect permissions on sendmail.

The sendmail binary on my system (and most other systems I have seen) has 
setuid bit set which ensures that when a normal user sends mail, the 
forked sendmail process has the correct permissions.

If this does not cure the problem, please email me at the below address 
(do not reply to this - see a previous message of mine), with whatever 
relevant details you have, such as version of sendmail (V5 or V8), 
whether it is IDA or another version.  I will endeavour to help you as 
much as possible.

Stuart

I'll second that. 

Until then, send blank e-mail to slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with

	Subject: mkpgp

mkpgp should show up in you mailbox within the hour.  If you're in a hurry,

 finger slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | pgp -f | tee mkpgp.txt.uu | more

will place the readme, atop a uuencode of the script, in your current 
directory as you read the manual.

mkpgp is a c-shell script that acts as a "go between" for Pine & pgp.

It features: editor of your choice, spell checker of your choice,
encryption (with or without signing), signing (with or without
encryption), encrypted attachments, effortless public key additions from
e-mail, decryption & signature verification, effortless encrypted
attachment extraction, and more...

If you want updates, send blank e-mail to slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with

	Subject: addtomkpgplist

mkpgp will show up each time the modification date changes.

Never had any problems with Word, but have had problems with emailing

Are you sure that you are both using the same version of Word?  Word 2.0 
cannot retrieve a Word 6.0 document.

Hi,

	I was wondering if I could use a .mailrc alias in PINE, instead of
cluttering up my addressbook with a ton of addresses, mixing personal and
business (yecch!) :) Thanks in advance.  -j-

To keep the keys consistent between the functions, wouldn't it be better 
(in the MIME attachment viewer) to have 'I' return the user to the index, 
and 'M' return the user to the main menu?  I find myself constantly 
hitting the 'I' key in the viewer, since that key works everywhere else.  
I've also noticed quite a few new users having this problem.  Thanks

Subject: 0.0 Preliminaries

This article describes these ways you can tell people on the Internet more 
about yourself:
 * Your signature file which is automatically included in your mail and 
   news messages.
 * Your finger information which is displayed when people finger you.
 * Your Organization line which is one of the headers in your mail and news 
   messages.

Subject: ... 0.1 Reading the Hypertext Version

The best way to read this FAQ (and most other FAQs too) is to view the
hypertext version using a Web browser such as Lynx, Netscape, Mosaic,
WinWeb, Panda, Tapestry, or Cello.  This will allow you to easily jump:

   * between subjects in this article
   * to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
   * to an Internet Request For Comments document (RFC)
   * to some manual pages

This and all FAQs that are crossposted to news.answers can be accessed through:
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html

This particular FAQ is at:

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 0.2 Reading the Plain Text Version (Digest Format)

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g to skip to 
  the next line that begins with ``Subject: ''

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For more information on using formail, see the formail(1) and 
procmail(1) man pages, and the Procmail FAQ:

Subject: 1.0 Automatic Signature - Basic Unix Instructions

Q: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my news articles
   and mail messages?

A: The answer depends on your newsreader and mailer but the following
   procedure works for many Unix newsreaders and mailers.


Type...                 In order to...
=======                 ==============
cd                      Change to your home directory (i.e., $HOME or ~)

pico .signature         Use the pico editor to create a .signature file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your signature>        Note that most systems require your sig to be <= 4
                        lines.  And it's good netiquette to make it as
                        short as possible.

<save and exit>         In Pico use ^x to exit and answer y when asked
                        if you want to save your changes.

chmod 644 .signature    Make .signature readable by all.

ls -l .signature        Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod a+x .             Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                        drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        group or other writable (?????w??w?) you may
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        Note that on some systems, such as VMS, some files 
                        and directories in your home directory need to be 
                        group or other writable, so only change permissions 
                        if you know what you're doing.  For more info on 
                        changing permissions see the chmod man pages.

For some newsreaders and mailers this is all you need to do to set up your
signature.  For example the default behaviour of pine(1), tin(1), and the rn 
family - rn(1), trn(1), strn(1), & Pnews(1) - is to automatically append 
 ~/.signature, if it exists.  If you use Elm, Mail, SUN OpenWindows Mailtool,
Emacs Mail Mode, MH, NN, or GNUS follow the additional instructions described 
below.

After you've set everything up use your mailer to mail a test message
to yourself, and your newsreader and/or news poster (such as nnpost or Pnews)
to post an article to a test newsgroup (use a local newsgroup and Distribution
set to ``local'' to save bandwidth).  Note that with many newsreaders and 
mailers you will not see your signature while you are composing a message - 
it will be automaticlally appended when you send the message.  Note also that 
many systems add a line that contains ``-- '' to the top of your sig.  This is 
used by programs that automatically deal with mail or news to identify the 
start of the signature.

If you have a problem with your sig see section 1.9 on Troubleshooting.

Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

Pine automatically appends ~/.signature (if it exists) to your messages.  
Many people like to set the signature-at-bottom variable which will put 
your signature below both your message and the message you are replying 
to (if you've included it).  Note that if you are forwarding a message 
your signature will be put below the message that you write but above 
the forwarded message.

Followup-To: comp.mail.misc

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Regular Unix "Mail" and "mail" don't have an automatic
signature mechanism.  Many people who normally use a more deluxe
mail utility occasionally find themselves resorting to using one
of these, in which case all you need to know is this command:

	~r $HOME/.signature

This simply tells Mail to include the text of the your signature
file.

=o= If you use Mail on a regular basis you may want to use the
semi-automatic signature feature.  When you're done typing your
message, you append a signature with this command:

	~a

=o= In order for this to work, though, you need to set the
"sign" mail variable.  There are two ways to implement this
variable.  The first is to set it in a $HOME/.mailrc file with
a command like this:

	set sign="Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

If your signature is more than one line long, you can use the
C language string syntax, as in these examples:

	set sign="Jym Dyer\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

			-or-

	set sign="Jym Dyer\
	\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

=o= The disadvantage of doing this in your .mailrc file is
that you now have to maintain the text of your signature in
two places.  Another approach that avoids this problem is to set
"sign" as an environment variable in your shell startup script.
For a Bourne-compatible shell, this is done with this command:

	sign="`cat $HOME/.signature`" export sign

For a C-shell, do this:

	setenv sign "`cat $HOME/.signature`"

Subject: ... 1.4 SUN OpenWindows Mailtool

By Jochen Bern, 7 November 1994

The mailtool of SUNs OpenWindows lacks numerous Things, including the
Ability to sign Mails. However, most OW Users stick with mailtool
because of the Ability to use "Attachments" to send around Files.

A simple Replacement for Signatures is to add a "Template" (click on
Edit -> Properties, select Category "Template" in the Properties
Window, and give Name and File as desired). Disadvantage: You have
to edit in every Signature by Hand, though.

A better Approach is to use a "set sendmail=..." Line in your ~/.mailrc.
Mails being sent out will be handed over to the Executable named
there instead of the Mail Delivery Subsystem. You can easily plug
in a simple Program to sign your Mails there. However, be warned that
all too simple Siggers aren't aware of the abovementioned Attachments,
so the Signature will end up in the last Attachment instead of the
Mail Text. A Sigger doing this correctly can be found at
file://ftp.informatik.uni-trier.de/pub/sunos/JoesMailtool/.

Note that this will cause the standard mail Command to use the Sigger,
too.

Subject: ... 1.5 Emacs Mail Mode

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Emacs Mail Mode is usually invoked with the "mail" or
"mail-other-window" commands (bound, respectively, to the
"C-x m" and "C-x 4 m" keys by default).  It is also invoked
from various Emacs mail and news packages.

=o= Mail Mode provides a "mail-signature" command to append
the contents of your signature file to the end of your mail
message.  This command is bound to "C-c C-w" by default,
so to insert the signature before mailing, simply type
"C-c "C-w".

=o= If you'd prefer to have your signature automatically
appended to the end of your mail message, the "mail-signature"
command can be put into your "mail-setup-hook" variable in
your $HOME/.emacs file, as in this example:

    (setq mail-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
	 (mail-signature) )))

This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.


Instructions for Version 19 by Richard Kasperowski
==================================================
In emacs 19, I use:

 (setq mail-signature t)

There is a problem with my expression with respect posting to USENET
via GNUS.  GNUS automatically appends .signature to the post when it
is sent out.  With (setq mail-signature t), .signature is appended to
the end of the emacs buffer in which you edit your post.  When you
send-out the post, another .signature is appended to the end.  You end
up with two .signatures on your USENET posts.

   This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.

=o= MH doesn't have an automatic signature mechanism, but it
is so configurable that there are a number of different ways
to implement one.  Check the periodic "MH Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) with Answers" posting for details.

=o= CAVEAT:  If you use the environment variable SIGNATURE to
point to your signature file, MH will use it not as a signature,
but as your "fullname".  Even worse, if your version of MH was
built with the "UCI" option and you *don't* use the environment
variable SIGNATURE to point to another file, MH will use the
$HOME/.signature file for this purpose!  To see if your version
of MH has this behavior, enter this command:

  % send -help

And look for the string "[UCI]" in the output.

=o= There's an Emacs interface to MH, called MH-E.  It has its
own signature mechanism, which is invoked with the "mh-insert-
signature" command (bound to the "C-c C-s" keys by default).

=o= This will insert the file $HOME/.signature file by default.
If your signature file has another name (e.g., to avoid its
being used by an MH build with the "UCI" option), you can set
the "mh-signature-file-name" variable to refer to a different
file.

A common problem people have with .signature (and .plan, .project, and

to make sure that you have set the permissions as instructed in 1.0 above.

If you are still having problems read the man pages for your newsreader,
news poster, or mailer and search for the string ``signature''.  There may 
be a variable you need to set in order for the ~/.signature to be appended.

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
man CommandName |less   Open man pages for CommandName (elm, pine, nn, tin
                        trn, Pnews, etc.) and pipe through less.  If your
                        system doesn't have less replace it with "more".

/signature              Search for first occurrence of "signature".

n                       Search for next occurrence of "signature".
                        Repeat the search until you find the appropriate
                        section of the manual.

u                       Page up half a screen. (This works in less but not in

Subject: 2.0 Finger - Basic Unix Instructions

If your host is running the finger daemon (fingerd) then
people around the world can find out more about you by fingering you.  
This is done by typing the following at a Unix prompt:

   finger YourUserID@your.fully.qualified.domain.name

On some systems finger is linked to f so the following also works:

   f YourUserID@your.fqdn


Finger displays different information on different systems.  Often it will 
display your full name, your default shell, when your were last logged on, 
and your ~/.plan and ~/.project files.

If you finger someone and the display takes more than one page you can pipe 
the output through less (or more if you don't have less).  For example to 
find out about Halcyon, my Internet service provider, type:

   finger info@halcyon.com |less


Finger can also be used to display information about groups of people.
For example:

   finger john@random.fqdn |less

Ths will display finger information about everyone with ``john'' in 
their name on random.fqdn.  You can get a short listing for each person
by using:

   finger -q john@random.fqdn |less


For technical details about the finger protocol see RFC1288.

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Change to your home directory.

pico .plan              Use the pico editor to create a .plan file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

chmod 644 .plan         Make .plan readable by all.

ls -l .plan             Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod a+x .             Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x.
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each.

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.

An easy thing that you can do to see if anyone has fingered you is type the 
following at your Unix prompt:

This tells you the last time someone accessed your .plan, but it doesn't
tell you who it was.  I have this in my .login because it's interesting to
see when the last time someone was checking on me!

[Note that under AFS (Andrew File System, a distributed filesystem),
 ls -lu $HOME/.plan will not work due to the fact that AFS has no 
 notion of ``atime'', or ``last accessed time''.]

Subject: ... 2.6 Backfinger Script

by Janet Rosenbaum

There is a script available called, among other things, backfinger,
planner, and finger_logger (flogger or frogger, for short).  This script
makes your plan into a named pipe (just think of this as a sort of
pipe used with plumbing that opens out onto the screen of the person who
is fingering you (fred)) so that when it is accessed, it looks for a
program from which to get something to stick on fred's screen.

The script is called when you are fingered.  At that moment, it looks to
the finger port of your unix machine and sees which machine fred is
on, logs that machine's IP number and hostname, and the date.  The script
can then execute a command to spit a plan out on fred's screen.  (One
might get creative and write a program that generates random poetry or
use the fortune program or just do "cat plan_file".)   To make fred
think you are really cool, it also tells him what machine he is
fingering you from.

Some caveats:

	-- This program must be running at all times on your system even
	when you are logged out.  Leaving a background process like this
	annoys most sys admins to no end, especially on systems with
	high load.  Do **not** run the program unless you are sure that
	you are allowed to run background processes like this.

	-- Also, if you decide you want to stop running this program,
	remove your .plan file as soon as you kill the process.  If you
	do not do this, all finger processes for you will hang.

	-- This script only tells you the machine fred is fingering you
	from, not his actual username.  It is nearly impossible to get
	this information except at sites with bad security.


Given the above, I will distribute the script to those who can use it,
mostly for educational reasons.  I admit that I no longer run the
program, since my two main accounts are on rather high-load systems.
Nevertheless, I learned quite a lot from modifying these scripts and
otherwise playing with these ideas.

Here is the web site:

 http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~jrosen/scripts/logger.src

I will also try to post this answer and the program to comp.sources.misc
at least monthly for those without web access.  (For those who have not
figured out the web, try the program lynx if you are on a vt100 or vt220
type terminal.  If you are on an xterm or hpterm, look for xmosaic.)

Note:  I am not the author of this program.  The version I distribute is
virtually identical to that distributed by Steve Franklin.

Subject: 3.0 What to Put in Your Signature and Finger Files

It is good netiquette to keep your signature to four lines or fewer.  And 
many news posters, such as some versions of inews(1), will not post an 
article that has a signature with more than four lines in it.  So, put large
large pictures, your philosophy of life , etc. in your finger files or in 
your Web pages and point people to those in your signature.

For signatures it's a good idea to keep the width less than 75 characters
so that if your signature is included in a followup preceded by an 
attribution character (like ``> ''), each line will still be on one line.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.1 URLs

A good strategy is to keep your signature short and include an
URL to your Web page, e.g.:

 <URL:http://www.jazzie.com/ii/>
  

If you do not have a Web page you might want to put in an URL 
that will finger you, e.g.:

 <URL:gopher://halcyon.com:79/0nancym>


The format that I've used above, ``<URL:protocol://server:port/name>''
is the current standard for URL specification.  To find out more about this

A good source of art for your signature and finger files is the ascii art
FAQ which contains (among others) these topics:
   9  Where can I find ASCII art?
  22  How do I put an animation in my plan?
  23  How do I make a sig?
  24  How do I have my sig automatically added to my posts and email?

The Ascii Art FAQ is at:  http://gagme.wwa.com/~boba/faq.html

Subject: ... 3.3 Animated Text Strings

Dotplan is a program that performs "animation" effects on text
strings, so that .plan files (hence the name) look a little more
fancy (on low-speed dialup lines).  Some of the effects make the
characters appear one at a time; others have the characters
appear at once and "move" around.

EXAMPLES
     dotplan 3 This is sample text # Display string using style 3
     dotplan                       # Display usage information
     dotplan s                     # Display styles in all styles
     dotplan d This is more text   # Display string in all styles
     dotplan 1 Hi there... > .plan # Save output in actual .plan file

From: Tim Pierce <twpierce@midway.uchicago.edu>
Subject: ... 3.4 Robot Fodder

Q: Tim, why do you and others put random, provocative words like
   the following in your sig?

    -- 
    Green Card fodder: Canter, Siegel, green card, Joel Furr, liable,
    fortune, conspiracy, CyberSell, Tennessee Bar.


A: The original genesis of this bit of lore was the NSA's
   supposed archiving of Usenet.  It's a popular urban legend
   that the NSA scans and archives every message posted to
   Usenet, and in the heyday of this story it was popular to
   add "spook fodder" to your .signature consisting of words
   like "conspiracy, bullion, plutonium, Saudi Arabia,
   president, assassination," and so on.  I think that the GNU
   Emacs distribution still comes with the code that would
   insert such words into your posts or .signatures
   automatically.
   
   A couple of years ago there was a nut named Clayton Cramer
   who would periodically bombard soc.motss with pages and
   pages of pseudo-scientific babble about the evils of
   homosexuality.  It got so tiring that after a while I
   amended my .signature to read "Clayton-Fodder:
   homosexuality, pedophilia, incest, guns, Second Amendment,
   Libertarian, Reagan," or some such.  It got quite a few
   giggles from some of the old hands out there.
   
   A more recent example was the case of "Serdar Argic," a
   program written by a U of Minnesota student to search for
   any article referencing Turkey or Turkish culture, and
   follow up with several pages of invective about Armenian
   genocide.  There were some reports that this program was
   faulty and began responding to articles about "Thanksgiving
   Turkey" and the like, but I don't recall ever seeing that
   happen, myself.  Nevertheless, people started putting "Argic
   fodder" into their .signatures, like "Turkey, Armenia, SDPA
   crooks, genocide" in order to bait the "Argic-bot" into
   following up.
   
   The latest rumor is that Canter and Siegel are archiving
   every post which refers to them, in the hopes of finding
   grounds for a libel suit.  Hence, my .signature (which only
   goes to newsgroups in the news.* hierarchy).  It's a
   ridiculous idea, but this is one of those bits of folklore
   which I really enjoy perpetuating.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.5 Newsgroups for Sig Discussion

As discussed in 3.2 above there are a number of newsgroups for discussing
ascii art.  There are also these newsgroups where people discuss signatures:

The War Lord of the West Preservation Fan Club:  alt.fan.warlord
Like alt.fan.warlord, only different: alt.stupid.signature.flame.flame.flame 

------------------------------

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 4.0 Organization Header

The Organization header in news and mail messages is another way you can tell 
people about yourself.  It is an optional header described in section
2.2.8 of RFC1036, "Standard for Interchange of Usenet Messages."

READING MESSAGES
================
Many mailers and newsreaders do not automatically display the Organization
header when you are reading a message you've received.  Often typing ``h''
(for header) will display all the headers of a message.  You can usually
set up your software to automatically display the Organization line each
time you view a messae.

COMPOSING MESSAGES
==================
Below are instructions for automatically having your Organization line
filled in each time you compose a message.  Some composers will 
automatically display your Organization header while you are composing,
and others won't.  

------------------------------

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 4.1 Tin and the RN Family
Followup-To: news.newusers.questions

Tin and the rn family of tools (Pnews, rn, trn, strn) get information for the 
Organization header from the ORGANIZATION environment variable if it exists.  
In the csh or tcsh you can set this variable in your ~/.login with a line like 
this:

  setenv ORGANIZATION "Your Organization Name"

After you edit your ~/.login you can establish the setting by either logging
out and loggin back in or by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

  source ~/.login

To check that the variable is set type:

  printenv

After it is set, post a test message to a local test newsgroup with local
distribution to check that the Organization header is correct.

Subject: ... 4.2 Pine 3.90 and Later
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you set the Organization and other headers 
using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the customized-hdrs variable.
   b) Type a for Add Value
   c) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
      Note that if you have set the ORGANIZATION environment variable
      (which is described in 4.1 above) you can type: 
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION

While reading a message that you've received you can view the Organization
header and all the other headers by typing h.  If h does not work you need 
to go to your configuration menu and set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^r (view rich headers).

NOTE: The customized-hdrs variable is not available in Pine 3.89 and below.

Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

Use your editor to create a file named ~/.elm/elmheaders that contains
any headers you'd like in your outgoing mail messages.  For example, my
 ~/.elm/elmheaders file contains this one line:

Organization: Infinite Ink, Seattle, WA, USA

Subject: ... 4.4 NN
Followup-To: news.software.nn

Use your editor to put the following lines in your ~/.nn/init file:

set news-header Organization: Your Organization Name
set mail-header Organization: Your Organization Name

This will add the Organization header to both news and mail messages
sent from NN.

While reading messages with NN you can view the Organization line
by adding O (the letter "oh") to your header-lines variable setting.
I like the following setting:

set header-lines AFOnWK*Y

I'm trying to setup Pine with PC-NFS v5.0, I'm having some initial trouble
configuring it to recognize my SMTP host. 

I am using NDIS drivers and I wonder if there is a configuration file for 
pine to specify host names...

I haven't even begun to setup IMAP <yikes> - Is it possible to NFS mount the
mail directory and have pine look at the drive instead?


Any help would be appreciated.

Is there a way to keep PINE from displaying the long list of e-mail 
addresses in the header when sending to an addressbook group? That is, I 
have an addressbook group with about 20 people in it, and it displays 
every address in the header. I would like to just have the name of the 
group in the "To:" line in the header, instead of all the addresses.

Thanks!
I'd prefer e-mail responses, but post if you need to.

Six days ago pine started acting strangely on the machine at my work
(SGI Indy, IRIX 5.2, Pine 3.90 them, 3.91 now)

Whenever anyone starts pine, the INBOX is opened READONLY, and only one
message is listed, titled /usr/mail/juser, which when opened contains
all the current messages.

The documentation suggests that it is a problem with the locking mechanism.
I looked in /tmp (and /usr/tmp) for lock files of the form
./usr/mail/juser - but there are no files of this type.

No other copies of pine are running on the system, and I do not know of
any system changes made that day (although something apparently was
changed)

My users are being forced to use "Mail" and they are not happy. What am
I missing? HELP!

Thanks,

Besides this addition to net.cfg, is there some way to minimize PC-Pine's
memory usage ? I need to get PC-Pine up and running for my local users,
who will be sharing a copy of the executable, found on a Novell server.

If I load the ODI stack and NETX.EXE (and McAfee's VSHIELD), the max.
executable size is 455kb: Pine loads but bombs shortly afterwards with an
"insufficent free memory" error. The typical machine also has several MB
of extended memory, but Pine doesn't seem to use it.

I realise that what I meant to say here is that the folders are created 
on a unix system, but it is as viewed from PC-Pine (or Wpine) that the 
distinct folders cannot be seen.

Please forgive my insistence on this question, but my users are getting
cranky... :(

I need to set up PC-Pine for shared use on a public directory in a Novell
fileserver. Setting up the mail folders, addressbooks and the like is not
a problem, since all pertinent environment variables can be set up on
either the user or the system login script. Unfortunately, memory usage is
a severe problem.

After loading up the ODI stack, NETX and perhaps a few other goodies (such
as DOSKEY or McAfee's VSHIELD), the typical PC has left around 450KB of
main memory, plus extended memory (our machines have at least 6MB total
memory). The main memory consumer is, unfortunately, NETX.EXE, which is
indispensable for accessing the fileserver. This is proving to be
insufficent for PC-Pine, which does start up but bombs shortly afterward
due to lack of memory, after attempting to do anything more complicated
than just staring at the main menu.

Is there any way to set up PC-Pine to reduce its memory requirements ?
Perhaps a "swap mode" or something like that ?

Thanks for any insights.

Can't you install it somewhere under your own $HOME and use it?  That's
always worked for me.

Subject: 0.0 About this Article

Q: How can I have my incoming mail messages automatically put into an 
   appropriate folder?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This article 
is the first release of an FAQ that addresses this question.  This version 
gives basic instructions for how to set up either procmail or Elm's filter 
to filter incoming mailing list messages.  Future versions of this FAQ will 
include instructions for doing other things like automatically replying to 
certain messages.

If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the Elm and filter developers
recommend procmail over filter.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
 Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key 
  and g key pressed together) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------
|                                 Pipe
a                                 Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/mail/faq.split   Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a file named
                                  ~/mail/faq.split.  (Replace ~/mail
                                  with your folder directory.)
pine -if faq.split                Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

For example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a
folder named IN.procmail.  I do this so that when all my folders
are listed alphabetically the incoming folders are together and
near the top.  They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive
and upper case letters come before lower case letters in an ascii
sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders.

Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up procmail to
filter incoming mailing list messages.

To find out how to process existing mail folders see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

Subject: ... 2.1 Setting Up Procmail

1] Find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using csh type:

     which procmail

   Or if you are using sh or ksh type:

     type procmail

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``whereis'' and
   ``where''.  If your system doesn't have procmail ask your system 
   administrator to install it.  If your sys admin isn't able to do this,
   use a different mail processor like deliver, mailagent, or filter 
   (described in part 2 of this FAQ).


2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

  
2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace ``mail'' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd
     cd .procmail
     pico rc.test


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.test:

      :0:
      * ^Subject: .*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in the subject "Explanation of Test Recipe" below.


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace ``nancym'' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file: If 
      procmail resides below your home directory write out the *full* path.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
    ``test'' in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were
    delivered correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can determine what
      the problem is.  

    * Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.test

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.procmailrc so
      that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  If you are still having problems see the 
      subject "Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail" below.

   
8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.folders for filtering incoming messages into mail folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.folders


8b] Enter a modified version of the following in ~/.procmail/rc.folders

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second recipe
     filters the procmail mailing lists  The meaning of the first recipe is 
     as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     Create a recipe for each of your mailing lists.  Make sure that you
     use ``^TO'' with no space between the caret (^) and the word ``TO'', 
     and that both letters are capitalized -- if you don't it won't work.

     Note that ^TO is not a normal regular expression.  It is a special
     procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination 
     specification.  See the MISCELLANEOUS section of the procmailrc(5)
     man page for details.  For examples, see procmailex(5) man page.
     

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.test line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

     Note that it's useful to leave the rc.test line there for future testing.

Subject: ... 2.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

There is a useful script, which is part of the procmail package, for 
checking your procmail log file called mailstat.  Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either ``which mailstat'' or ``type mailstat''.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  It is located with all the other procmail tools at:

Subject: ... 2.4 Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

Some systems do not need a .forward file (i.e., having a .procmailrc file 
suffices if procmail already is the local delivery agent).

Subject: 3.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:03:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject: ... 3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

Juan, why don't you use memeory manager like QEMM or 386MAX to load some
drivers into the upper memory region ? And VSHIELD also use expanded or
extended memory.

I am including a message from one of our pine users about a printing 
problem.  He is not the only one that has been having trouble.  One 
"try" I received from this list awhile back is to set 
"preserve-start-stop-characters".  He tried this and it did not work. 

We are using pine 3.91 on osf/1 V 3.0.  We have no problem printing from pine
3.89 on a DEC Ultrix 4.3A.

 I followed your advise but to no avail. I tried printing  the same 
message, app 4000 byte but only one page printed.
The only difference this time is that the two small smiley faces followed by 
the number six were no longer in the upper left hand corner.

I am using Crosstalk as my communication package, running under windows. 
Both printer settings, in windows and in crosstalk are set properly.
I am set for Zmodem VT100 8N1.

As my computer is a notebook I can stop by next week if you think that 
might make diagnosing the problem any easier.

Thanks for your help.

An idea ---would my modum speed have any effect?
It is a 14.4 with compression softrare that allows it to go up to 56

You don't get the system defaults because "" is considered to be a
value meaning no news-collection (of course this is useful if you
don't want to read news with pine).

Some users here actually did this, intending to eliminate an
alternative setting they'd tried.

Workaround is to Change "" to anything and then Delete value.

Dave,
I'll resist asking "What changed six days ago?"... :)

The symptoms suggest that Pine is not recognizing the folder as a 
legitimate mailbox, so it's opening it as an arbitrary file.

Take a careful look at the mailboxes (especially the first "From " message 
separator, if you're using Bky mail format) and compare with a folder 
than Pine can successfully open.  Also look for an extraneous newline at 
the beginning, or for a null anywhere in the folder.  (For example, is it 
possible a bogus message with a null in it was delivered six days ago to 
everyone having the problem?)

Please let us know what you discover.

Sherry,
Can you verify that OSF/1 is configured to enable software flow control 
by default?  If not, setting "preserve-start-stop-characters" won't 
help... (until version 3.92 when Pine will try to tell the OS to honor 
them in any case.)

If my hypothesis (that OSF/1 --at least at your site-- doesn't enable s/w
flow control by default) then I suspect that 3.91 (with "preserve..." set)
would work fine on Ultrix, and 3.89 would fail the same way on OSF.

Let us know what you discover...

Our documentation is broken on this point...

In order to *turn off* a system-wide default (e.g. nntp-server, or
news-collection, or default-fcc), you need to specify the "empty value" or
"null string" in your personal pinerc. 

If you are editing the .pinerc directly, this is done using the pair 
of double quotes to denote a null string.

To do this via the setup/config screen: first delete any value currently 
set, then press ADD, immediately followed by RETURN.  It should say 
you've gotten the empty value.

(We know: Either the docs or the U.I. needs some help here.)

   Typical of languages like English who oblige to put a pronoun
   subject before the verb, in order to tell it is 3rd person
   (he/she/it took). This misunderstanding could be easily avoided
   in Latin origin languages where the 3rd person of a verbal form has
   its own ending, and one does not need the subject ("took" would be
   enough in such case)   :-) :-) :-)

  How would you define your own headers in PINE 3.05? Which varibles in

In Pine, is it possible to pipe a message to a program and have the
output displayed normally, i.e., not in the viewer.  E.g., how would
I get ``|cat'' to just cat the message, i.e., display the whole message,
scrolling off the screen if necessary?

Thanks much,
Nancy

I've read in this group that Pine cannot do uuencode/decode for "good
reasons".  What are those reasons?  (If this question is answered by some
existing document, please point me to it.) I have no problem with doing
uuencode/decode by hand, but most of the other users at my site avoid Unix
commands like the plague and are very dependent on user friendly programs
like Pine.  However, they communicate with users at other sites who don't
have the ability to send or receive MIME attachments, so they have to send
and receive binary files via uuencode.  It would make life much easier for
them if they could decode the messages without having to use shell
commands (which they are forever asking me to repeat).

I like to use Pine as a news reader in an xterm.  I also want to use
mailtool as my mail reader.  If I receive mail while I am reading news in
Pine, I want to be able to open mailtool, read my mail, and close
mailtool, without losing my current newsgroup context in Pine.  I can't do
this, however, because if I use mailtool while Pine is running, Pine will
keep complaining about the INBOX having been changed by another program. 
Is there a way of invoking Pine so that it ignores the INBOX and lets
another program act as the mail program?  Alternatively, is there a way,
while reading news in Pine, to switch to reading mail, then switch back to
reading news without losing the current newsgroup context (newsgroup, sort
order, current article)?

We are running both Pine and Pico on DG/UX 5.4R3.10 with no difficulty.  We
got the sources from the main Pine site.  If you have trouble getting them

I use procmail to filter mailing lists and pine as my mailer.

Periodically a stored message will get trashed and Pine's index
will present a line like this:

   57         [ No Message Text Available ]


My questions are:
   * Does this happen to anyone else?
   * Does anyone know why this is happening - is it because my
     folders are publically available or is it a general problem 
     with Pine and Procmail?
   * And finally, how can I prevent this from happening?  I
     use a lock file with all my mailing list recipes (i.e., 
     they start with ``:0:'').

Thanks for any help,
Nancy

	I want the users on the system to report bugs directly to me 
instead of the standard bug address.  I've changed the bug-fullname and 
the bug-address in pine.conf file, but it never sees it.  The pine-degug 
file still shows the original address being read.  Where should i change 
this information?
	Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I will try to explain this the be I can but I may not have the correct 
terminology.  Please bear with me.

When I open any of the folders I have the same problem. First, at the 
bottom the commands menu will only give me one line of commands, no 
matter what I do--only one line.  I do not have all the commands 
memorized so ...  

Next: same with all folder. The list of messages in the folders is 
duplicating itself.  In other words, if I select or highlight say #6, 
then I have two #6s listed.  This gets *very* confusing as I scroll up 
and down the messages.

Both of these problems surfaced at the same time and both started about 3 
weeks ago.  I'm running a MAC LC with 10 megs of RAM and PINE 3.90.

I hope this is not just a case of too many buttons and not enough brains.

Respond by e-mail please. <pilgrim@xmission>  TIA

cat >/dev/tty, of course.

Though there is a complication: Pine has adjusted the terminal
settings to suit its needs, and those are at odds with the settings
you normally use.  So while 'cat >/dev/tty' should work, it will look
pretty messy.

To get things looking nicer, you have to do a bit more work.  You have
to save the terminal state that Pine uses, then adjust the terminal
state to a 'normal' one, then run cat, then set the terminal state
back the one Pine needs.  And do that all in a subshell. On my system
this did the trick:

@{stty -g </dev/tty >stty.pine; stty `{cat stty.g} >/dev/tty; cat >/dev/tty; 
  stty `{cat stty.pine} >/dev/tty}

(Though your stty command might work differently and you probably aren't
using the rc shell.)

I ran 'stty -g >stty.g' in a (normal) xterm window to generate the
'normal' terminal settings.

If you want to do this more than once then you probably want to
package all that in a shell script.

Load EMSNETX instead of NETX. Use MEMMAKER to optimize memory usage.

I've searched and haven't been able to find news.announce.newgroups.
Also, there's a group on landscape architecture, but I haven't been
able to find that either.  
Any ideas?

Here are 2 different methods to subscribe to all newsgroups that
your host gets:

USING TRN
=========
You do not need to be a TRN user to use this method.
This method is easier but can take a *lot* more time than the next
method (using nngrep).

At the newsgroup selection level type: 

  a .

This means add newsgroups matching pattern ``.'', i.e., containing
any single character.  Then at the [ynYN] prompt type Y to add
them all.  

Question: Does anyone know if there is a way to avoid viewing all the
newsgroup names that get added - this can take a *long* time?


USING NNGREP
============
You do not need to be an NN user to use this method.

cd
cd .nn               # if you don't have .nn dir don't worry about next line
mv LAST LAST.old     # LAST keeps track of the last newsgroup nn knows about
cd
mv .newsrc .newsrc.old
nngrep -u | sed -e 's/ *$/:/' > tmp.unsub    # See below (*) for explanation
pico tmp.unsub       # replace pico with your editor; 
                     # remove any lines at the top that say ``Connecting...''
                     # (Halcyon doesn't produce these lines so you don't need 
                     # to do this step at Halcyon.)
cat .newsrc.old tmp.unsub > .newsrc 

Next run your newsreader (nn, trn, tin, etc) to be sure that it understands
your new .newsrc.  If it does:

rm tmp.unsub
rm .newsrc.old

If it doesn't you can get your old .newsrc back with this:

mv .newsrc.old .newsrc


(*) "nngrep -u" lists all unsubscribed newsgroups and then the sed
    command appends a ":" to the end of each of these newsgroup names
    and then ">> .newsrc" appends them to the bottom of your .newsrc.

Hope this helps.
If anyone knows any other methods of subscribing to all newsgroups,
please let me know.
Thanks,
Nancy

       I use the pine newsreader (because it is what my university uses) 
and use PCAnywhere to dial in.  I know PCAnywhere is hardly the 
communications software of choice, but my office uses it for other stuff, 
so I use it to dial in to my Internet account.  I have no trouble 
downloading files from my Internet account to my home computer, but I 
cannot figure out how to upload files.  Is there any good soul out there 
who has some idea about how to do this ?  (I have taken the obvious 
steps, but it just doesn't seem to work.)

      Thanks.

I sent Robert Perlberg a couple of scripts that do the trick. If anyone 
else wants them, e-mail me.


An aside: Why doesn't MIME retain file permissions like tar, 
compress, uuencode?

Is there a way to print out the entire on-line manual.  I know that the 
answers to many of my questions about our system should be in the manual 
and that I *ought* to be able to get them by typing "man [confusing 
term], but I often can't locate anything or find what I do locate 
hopelessly confusing.  I think I might do better if I had a hard copy of 
the whole thing available.  Can it be done ?

Thanks (and thanks to all of you who respond to the question of us newbies).

Pine does not have integral uuencode/uudecode support because:

 o In Pine it is already possible to *decode* uuencoded messages in 4
   keystrokes, using pipe.  (Hint: make "ud" a link to uudecode.)
 o The alt-editor feature may be used in combination with scripts
   to obviate the need for suspending Pine to *encode* a message.
   (I presume that's what your script does.)
 o With the advent of CMU's mpack/munpack software, which functions just
   like uuencode but handles MIME as well, there is no excuse for not
   having MIME capability at a site, even if it isn't yet builtin to
   the available mailers.
 o There are apparently several slightly incompatible variants of uuencode.
 o MIME supersedes and obsoletes uuencode.  
 o In view of the above, for the people who pay the bills for Pine 
   development, adding integral uuencode support is an extraordinarily 
   low priority.

since pico isn't there, when it is making pine I also am getting an
ErrorCode 1 (I think this is because pico wasn't made)  Any idea on
how to solve the problem, or just how to compile it without pico 
(since there is already a copy of pico on the system....)
	any help is appreciated

can anyone tell me how to stop receiving Pine information?

I have tried the single word "unsubscribe" twice, but the material 
still keeps coming.

I have also sent a brief note to "majordomo", but to no avail.

Thanks.

	Well, it seems the list keepers of pine are just as busy as
ever.... :-)

	What I generally do is set up my filtering, procmail in my case,
to send "unsubscribed" list mail to /dev/null, until I *really* get
unsubscribed.  :-) :-)

Last I checked SVR4 would exec a csh for you if it encounters a scrip that
starts with:

#!/bin/csh -f
# ChooseNews II.  Version 2.4 By Scott A. Yanoff    yanoff@csd4.csd.uwm.edu
# (C) 1994 Computing Services Division, Univ. of Wisconsin - Milwaukee

even if you are running another shell as your login shell.  Xenix would not
properly sort out this sort of stuff, but that was a long time ago and I am
reasonably certain that all versions of SVR4 and BSD will handle that.  I
have not experience with Linux, but believe it knows how to handle this as
well.

Mailed and posted.

It's primarily a mail reader.  It's engine internally doesn't make a 
distinction between news and mail.  It treats newsgroups as mail folders 
with restricted permissions, and so in the mail composition module, it 
doesn't know where the message it's replying to came from.  It notes a 
"Newsgroups:" header, and figures it's supposed to be posted as well as 
mailed.  Clearly, it needs to be able to make a distinction at the 
beginning of what sort of message this really is, and handle unexpected 
header lines with more grace.  They're not going to remove the ability to 
post and mail simultaneously, because sometimes that's a really 
worthwhile thing to be able to do.  Perhaps, if they just stripped off 
the Newsgroups: header when composing a reply to mail, their engine could 
remain more or less unchanged.

I'm fairly sure the Pine Development Team knows about this problem, and 
I'd expect the next release to fix it.  No release dates are available, 
and we're not sure if it's going to be 3.92 or 4.0.  If I can get in the 
Beta circle again, I'll try to make sure it gets addressed.

Sure.  You need to have the Developer's Version of TCP/IP.  Which implies 
you need to have TCP/IP at all.  The developer's version contains 
netdb.h and that other header you're missing.  If you're going to be 
compiling much of anything from the Internet, you'll probably want to 
pick up the Developer's Version of TCP/IP.  Note that this is separate 
from the Developer's System, which contains the compiler tools and such.

So for the moment, go to fp.celestial.com and pick up a precompiled 
binary there.

Majordomo is a piece of software, not a person, so I'm not surprised you 
didn't get a reply to your "brief note".  Here's how you tell Majordomo 
to take you off the list:
 
 o Address a message to:  majordomo@cac.washington.edu
 o Leave the subject blank
 o The message text should say: unsubscribe pine-info
 
Do not include anything else in the text, not even a signature.  If you 
are sending the message from an address other than the one where you 
receive pine-info, add your subscription address like this:
    unsubscribe pine-info msaaron@mscc.huji.ac.il

Date: 19 Dec 1994 20:39:35 GMT
Message-Id: <3d4r27$6vn@news.halcyon.com>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Does anyone have any recommendations for a Windows editor that autowraps,
i.e., puts in a carriage return/line feed to keep each line less than 
approx 75 characters?   Ideally it would be smart enought to readjust
the lines when they are edited.  Something like Pico but that has full 
mouse, clipboard, etc. capability.  Notepad (even with Word Wrap checked)
doesn't seem to be very good (but maybe someone knows some tricks for
making Notepad do what I want).

FYI, I need this to be used as the alternate editor (^_) with PC Pine
for Windows.

Thanks much,
Nancy

	Well I found the problem. It wasn't with pine, but there was
a problem on my box. I use a compression library on my Linux box called
'zlibc' which allows me to use compressed data and text file. It seams
that pine3.91 doesn't like this library, so the fix is that I have to
unlink zlib from libc.so.4 and link libc.so.4 to a standard library.
	Everything works fine. Thanks to those who responded to my
plea. If anyone is having trouble with this type of setup I would be
glad to help.

According to the faq you are suppose to be able to sent mail to a list by 
using the Bcc: header and the names in the list will not show up in the 
recipients mail. This doesn't work for me. What I get is all the names 
in the list showing up in the recipients mail with the following annotation:
Apparently to user@somewhere
Apparently to anotheruser@somewhere
etc

Any help? I'd like to be able to mail to some rather large lists I have 
without two or three pages of names showing up.

It has nothing to do with being angry.  It has everything to do with an 
attempt to suppress misinformation being distributed as folklore, that 
subsequently comes back as support issues.

Once again, with feeling: IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH SIDE OF THE IMAP TREE 
IS USED!!!

If you think it matters, you are mistaken.

Perhaps I should just stop distributing the ANSI side of the IMAP tree, 
and convert all the ANSI ports to non-ANSI prototypes prior to 
distribution.

Or maybe I should call the two sides of the tree imap/blurdybloop and 
imap/sarasoop.

Which side of the imap/ANSI imap/non-ANSI tree is used has nothing to do
with -DANSI. 

The IMAP toolkit does not define the ANSI symbol.

The IMAP toolkit does not use the ANSI symbol.

A directory name has no relationship to a C compiler symbol.

Send email to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu detailing the error messages 
which you are getting.

Greeting and happy holidays to all....

Got a question.  The univeristy I access the net through uses PINE for mail
processing.  I like the interface real well, and would like to use it as
a part of my Windows PPP connection.  I am currently using Chameleon's 
default mail client that is included in the sampler, as well as connecting
with Chameleon.  Will the PC-Pine 3.1 work with the winsock driver that
Chameleon uses, and if so, can anyone give me an FTP site where I can get
it from.

Thanks in advance!

Hello everyone,

I am totally raw in the area of Pine and News. I actually found Pine by 
accident on our University system (I connect from home via a modem). I need 
to ask some question. Please, if these are FAQ's, don't flame, simply 
direct me to the appropriate document. 

1. I've noticed threads on reading News with Pine. I assume this is Usenet 
news...The only readers I have noticed being talked about, however, are nn 
and tin. The university system here runs rn. How would I be able to read 
News in this case?

I have many other questions, but I'll save them for now.

Thanks in advance!

I am using xvnews as my news reader (yes, I know I could use pine) and after
saving a news article I try and read it using pine. It comes up that the mail
file is (READONLY) but it seems that it has added an extra header and does not
use the headers in the saved news file. 

I have tried using mail and this quite happily reads the inbuilt headers.

Is there any way to make pine read the saved news files.

Many thanks,

Phil

Hi,

     I am coming in from an NCR 3450 parallel processor with gig and
megs trying to get a UseNet feed up.  From what I understand, Pine will
do this (and many more).  So, I am in need of information on how to set
this up with NNTP on our SVR4 Unix box.  Any and all help is appreciated.

                                                Thanks . . .

~~~~~~Are you completing the "To:" field?  This is what I do on my Pine
3.89 and it works.  Make a dummy list in your address book with the
nickname "dummygood" for instance, using a generic full name such as "All
recipients on Santa's list", and your own address. Then compose your msg 
by typing in "dummygood" in the "To:" field.  Access rich headers (^R) to 
get the "Bcc" header, and type in the actual group distrib listname there.  
Note that the Bcc will show up in your sent-mail copy, but not in the 
recipients'.

How do you setup local news groups to work with Pine.  I seem to be able 
to define a directory area, but I don't seem to be able to do anything 
else with it.  What are the required permissions for the directory, etc.  
I'm using Pine v3.90 running on a DEC Alpha using OSF/1 v2.0.  Thanks!

Well, you can have virtual nested folders using Pine's select
command (;).  For example, I keep all non-mailing-list mail that 
I receive in one folder called Received.  Whenever I want to look 
at everything I've received from namex I type:

 ; t f namex z

To go back to the full list type:

 ; a

To view all mail I got today I type:

 ; d o ^t z

To view all messages that contain wordx in the subject type:

 ; t s wordx z


This is one of the very great features of Pine 3.90 and higher!

You can have more than one address book in pine, one for business and one

need to translate it to an address book entry first.

Our editor, Codewright, can autowrap as you describe.  It's very

As someone else here put it earlier today, I'm fairly new to Pine, like 
it a lot, and understand it a little. In that context, can someone please 
(in English!) tell me how to do file transfers via e-mail between me 
(Pine 3.90, via a PC/modem calling into a Unix-based university computer) 
and someone who accesses e-mail through either Compu$erve or AOL?

I know how to attach a file to my messages. I know how to extract a file 
from my messages. But this only seems to work when I'm doing it with 
someone else who is running Pine. What am I missing? I've tried sending 
an attachment to someone, both as a standard .gif file and as one that 
has been run through uuencode. In each case, the recipient got my e-mail, 
but no attached file.

Any help would be muchly appreciated. Thanks!

Please forgive me if this has been answered countless times before.
I'm new to Pine, like it a lot, understand it a little, and hope to
understand it a lot more in the *very* near future.

I would like to set the margins on the messages I create, but I
don't see how to do this in the Setup area.  Is it possible to set
the margins, and if so, how is it done?  Many thanks.

I'm sorry...but I got in on this thread late.  Could someone please post a
summary of this thread.  I have tried to get pine configured to read my
custom .newsrc file (~/.newsrc) and haven't been able to.

move messages from my INBOX to an MH folder. If anyone is in the know
would they care to share it with us (ie. post) or with me (ie email)?

Thanks and Seasonal Greeetings,

Andreas

Yes, from Newsgroups point of view the above two headers would certainly be
nicer...but what did the original poster of this thread have in mind?

FWIW I use Editeur. You can have several doc's open at once, in addition 
to the requirements you have above. I don't know where to ftp to get it 
though. I got off CompuServe. Shareware cost $20. BTW it's an ASCII 
editor in case you are worried about that.

Comes here Mr. Phil Howle with this opinion in the"comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 20 Dec 94 09:00:49 -0500:

 +  I am using xvnews as my news reader (yes, I know I could use pine) and after
 +  saving a news article Itry and read it using pine. It comes up that the mail
 +  file is (READONLY) but it seems that it has added an extra header and does
 +  not use the headers in the saved news file. 
 +  Is there any way to make pine read the saved news files.

That's weird...it works fine for me...

While you are saving an article from xvnews have you by any chance set it to
save them with read permission only? (ls -al filename ---> r------- ??)

I saved a file from tin, then chmod the file to 400 and then did pine -f file
which then gave me (READONLY) access error message. By default it should be
read/write able by the owner of the file.

Using PC-Pine 3.91, how do we get it to get the ~/.addressbook and

Any information would be appreciated.

Diane,
For now, those files need to *appear* to be available locally on the PC.
Thus, in order to use the same files that Unix Pine sees, you need to 
"mount" them on your PC using a file service protocol such as NFS or SMB.

In the future, we expect to have a more self-contained method of 
accessing remote support files.

Since signature files don't usually change much, you can keep a second 
copy on your PC (named PINE.SIG), but you probably don't want to have two 
copies of your addressbook, unless you update it very rarely.

-teg

p.s. the same issues apply to .newsrc files.

Ralph,
3.91a is just 3.91 with the patch that has been posted here previously
applied.  (The patch fixes a bug that prevented some pine.conf
variables from being set.  Needed if, for example, you want to set a local 
email address for the bug report command.)

I'm updating the spell checking section of the FAQ and I have some 
questions that I hope some of you can help me with.  First, here's 
what I've done for myself.  Note that I already use an alternate
editor so I can't use the very cool alternate-editor=ispell trick.

1] In my $HOME/Bin I've linked spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/Bin/spell

2] In my .login set the SPELL environment variable like this:

    setenv SPELL "$HOME/Bin/spell"

3] In my home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains my private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.


The reason I've done these convolutions is that it seems like
Pine wants the name of the spellchecker to be ``spell'', i.e.,
just setting SPELL to ispell doesn't work.  Also, it doesn't seem
to work if I skip step 2 (and have $HOME/Bin first on my path).  So 
does anyone know of a better way to do this.

Thanks for any info,
Nancy

Sadly, Lori, a hard copy of crap is still crap.  I've found the UNIX man 
only of value when you already know what you're doing but can't remember 
syntax, switches, etc.

If you really want to learn more about UNIX the best thing is to borrow 
or buy an introductory book.  Good luck.

 +   I would like to make my favorite mail program more user-friendly

 +   to do is change the YOU HAVE NEW MAIL to a more personalized 
 +   message.  Does anyone out there have any more ideas?

Since you posted to comp.mail.pine I think you are talking about Pine,
but what is this "YOU HAVE NEW MAIL" thingy ?

There's bunchothings you can do with the newer Pine (3.90+) You can read
news, you can postpone more than one mail composition, you can customize
default compose headers, a better help index screen, toggle betwn 2 editors...
the list can go on and on.... Hope this gives you some ideas!

 +   summary of this thread.  I have tried to get pine configured to read my
 +   custom .newsrc file (~/.newsrc) and haven't been able to.

1- First of all make sure you are using version 3.90 and higher...
2- Go to (M)ain/(S)etup/(C)onfig screen. (letters within braces are commands)
3- (A)dd the local newsserver's address as the value for the nntp-server option.
4- Go further down in the same Config screen to set the newsrc-read-order
   option to your preference.
5- (E)xit and (Q)uit out of Pine completely.
6- Start again Pine, go to (L)ist, choose the news collection.....

The rest will be magic...also you can set the intial keystrokes list at the
prompt to something like this as an example...

% pine -I l,n,v,v

I'm glad you asked!  Here's a *REVISED* draft of a section of the Pine FAQ
that I just updated.  I'm not sure if it is correct so it would be
great if people could send me feedback on it.  Here are a couple
questions I have:

* Do all versions of ispell use ispell.words as the default
  personal dictionary?
* How can you tell if ispell and spell are already linked on
  your system?
* Is there an easier way to do Method 2?
* Any suggestions for improving this?

===
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?


If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary ($HOME/ispell.words,
which contains a list of words, one word to a line) then it is nice to also 
use ispell for spell checking your outgoing mail messages.  There are two 
methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is by using either of these commands:

     which ispell
     whereis ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck then
   it is set up correctly.

Note that with Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, like
``I'' to add a word to your dictionary.

If you are using the pine native-mode spell checker (^T), the answer is
'no' (to the best of my knowledge).  That's why the alternate program
'ispell' is so appealing.  If you use its full-capability mode (^_) then
you can insert (I) your name (and any other acceptable words) in your
private dictionary.  Edit the dictionary file if you want to check it and
remove spurious words.  -mr

Another possibility is to tell those people with SVR4 who do not have
conforming compilers that they need to install GCC.  There are a number of
packages that require one to do this for SunOS 4.1.3.

Why not use a cpp macro that will instantiate to nothing for setups that
cannot handle this?  Jove used something like this for aa number of years.
It is an interesting hack.

I just got Pc Pine for Windows and it's at: ftp.cac.washington.edu

But I have a question, why is it when I try to compose a message it says 
I have no remote folder collections or something like that. And mail that 
was sent to my PINE (under UNIX) doesn't appear under PC-Pine?

Please reply E-Mail....

Good afternoon.

I am currently using unix's standard spell checker.  I would like to get 
another one that is better.  Can you recommend one that will work with 
pine?  Also, where can I get it on the internet?

Thanks for all your help.

If "account a" is on a Unix system, you need a text file called 
".forward" (dot forward) in a's home directory.  The file should contain 
the address of "account b", nothing else.
 
For example, asssuming "account a" is sharmam@ecf.toronto.edu and "account
b" is sharmam@wombat.marsupial.outback.au, then the .forward file should
say only sharmam@wombat.marsupial.outback.au
 
Once the .forward file is in place, any new mail received for 
sharmam@ecf.toronto.edu will be automatically forwarded to 
sharmam@wombat.marsupial.outback.au
 
For moe info on automatic mail forwarding, enter "man forward" at the 
Unix prompt.

Subject: Working with compressed folders?
Date: 21 Dec 94 23:42:26 GMT
Message-Id: <epstein.788053346@napcc-hp>
Status: O
X-Status: 


Is there any mechanism in pine for working with compressed folders?
What I'm thinking of is allowing folders (e.g. in ~/Mail) to be
compressed, and when they're read in, they are automatically
uncompressed, and then when they're closed, they are automatically
compressed again.

If there isn't such a mechanism (I'm pretty sure there isn't), how
hard would it be to add?

The reason I'm asking is that we're running tight on space in our
users partition, and saved Mail is taking up a fair amount of that
space.  Being able to compress all those folders should save us a lot
(I haven't actually tried to figure out exactly how much).

Perhaps this sounds like a crazy idea, but it seems like being able to
work with compressed folders (for both mail and news) could be a big
win.

Thanks for your help.

Note also that different implementations of 'ispell' use different user 
dictionary files:
	stein:	$HOME/.ispell_words
	saul:	$HOME/ispell.words
I have attempted a symbolic link from ispell.words->.ispell_words so that 
both programs would use the same file, ... but the symbolic link keeps 
disappearing!!!  Does anyone know why???  Thanks, -mr

I have the following trouble with Pine:

When I send a message with a file attached with Pine to my account b, which is 
a PPP connection, from my account a wich is a shell account Pegasus Mail, 
which I use on account b has the file received as an enclosure instead an 
attachment. The other way round it works fine. Is there a way to configure 
pine, so it sends the file as an attacment, or lies the problem somewhere else?

I would appreciate any help whith this!

Has anyone other than me been having dificulties with Pine lately?   Pine
3.91, last week or so, when I am reading mail, it will "randomly" act as if
I have given it a command, e.g., it will:
        ask me if I want to do 'x', or
        start/stop a reply,or
        open another e-mail, or
        ask me which e-mail I want to jump to, etc.

As far as I can tell, it does this independently of anything I may or may
not do.


FYI:
Mac Duo 230, 4 meg ram, system 7.1, 
Global Village Teleport Gold II mmodem, 
Kensington Turbo Mouse, lotsa extensions, 
and yes, I use Eudora for mail [when I'm in slip account (Mac TCP)], 
but I use Pine when in shell account [Z Term 0.9].  

Please reply by e-mail.  TIA.

This guy is probably the source of a few of your problems.  The GV modems 
do not come with any form of error correction out of the box.  I know 
because my girlfriend just got a PPC Performa, and this modem was 
included in the package.  When I read through the documentation, it said 
that error correction and data compression were available at an extra 
cost (on a 14.4k modem!).

Anyways, the wrong kind of line noise could be interpreted by PINE as a 
command as though you typed it in from the keyboard.  You might want to 
check with GV to see how much their error correction and data compression 
software is for their modem (software upgradeable hardware.....).

>Kensington Turbo Mouse, lotsa extensions,

Do you experience other problems when using SLIP?  Maybe not mail going 
off on its own, but do you ever have problems with bad downloads (ftp's)?

>but I use Pine when in shell account [Z Term 0.9].  

Great program!  It is what I use to login when I use Macs at work.

I'm having the same problem!!
Setup:
Mac IIsi, 6 meg ram, system 7.1
Hayes Accura Fax/Modem
Not too many extensions.  
I'm calling into a Gandalf Starmaster, which telnets out to our Alpha 3300.

It's very bizarre!!!!

I went back and made sure that imapd and ipop3d were alive in my
inetd.conf file, and even rebooted to make sure that inetd reread
its config file, but again to no avail. Still get connection
refused, 143. imapd, 143 is indeed listed in /etc/services. ???

Many newsreaders can not deal with attachments, CI$ and AOL amoung them.  
What you can do is uuencode the file and include it in the body of your mail 
message.  Then, assuming they know how to do it and have the tool, the 
recipient can uudecode it.  That was SOP before attachments came along.

For that price it sounds like a word processor.  I'm just looking
for a simple Windows editor, that's a little more powerful than
Notepad...

I'm going to try out Editeur (if I can find it) but I'm still interested
in what else is out there.

Thanks much,

You probably want an entry like 
   News *{tecoma.mccc.edu/nntp}[]
                         ^^^^^
If you don't have the /nntp Pine tries to use IMAP for news access, and 
IMAP assumes the .newsrc is stored on the server, not the client.

Setting "nntp-server=tecoma.mccc.edu" should obviate the need for the
above news-collection entry, but if the news-collection entry exists and
is wrong, it will over-ride the default.  So try setting nntp-server and
*deleting* the news-collection entry.

Message-Id: <AF.94Dec22185720@alpha.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk>

(For those interested, the story so far)

I wanted to get Pine to read MH style folders, (this I managed to
figure out myself) and to be able to move (ie S save in Pine-speak)
messages from my INBOX to a folder. In response to my first query I
received the following reply.

(BTW thanks to Alan Thew <alan.thew@liv.ac.uk> for the following:)

> Make sure that you have the full path of your MH folders in your
> .mh_profile with the Path variable (first), and use the line
>
> folder-collections=#mh/[]
> 
> in your .pinerc  (this works for me).

What I forgot to add in my first query is that I use PC-Pine to read
and administor my email when working on a PC. This means I run
imapd on the UNIX host email is delivered to. The appropriate lines
from PINERC (on the PC) read:

inbox-path={omega.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk}INBOX

folder-collections={omega.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk}#mh/[]

Everything works fine, I can read and delete messages from the INBOX,
I can open an MH style folder and read and delete messages, BUT I
can't save messages from INBOX to an MH style folder. If I hit 's' and
enter an existing folder name (eg cc) I get

Folder "cc" doesn't exist.  Create? 

with 'y' I get 

 [CREATE failed: Can't create mailbox #mh/cc: mailbox already exists]

Now, interestingly enough I can save (ie move) messages from one MH
style folder to another! Ie opening an MH style folder and using save
to another MH style folder works as expected.

Upon further investigation, I can reproduce this behaviour if I use
Pine on the UNIX box where I have my home account by setting the two
entries in my .pinerc as detailed above. This obviously means that the
problem dosen't lie with PC-Pine.

On a related note, I only have one INBOX in my Folder List, I'm
missing the MH inbox folder. Ihere is here of course a confilct as
Pine refers to the actual maildrop as the INBOX, whereas MH uses inbox
to be the the default folder. 

Any ideas?

Please email me a copy of any suggestions, I'm away until Next Year!

Thanks,

I don't know if this is better, but I do something like this...

(1) point the alt-editor to myeditor

(2) put this script in ~/bin/myeditor (chmod 700 myeditor)

#!/bin/csh -f
set MYREALEDITOR = "whatever -whateverOptions"
set SPELLER = "ispell -x"
$MYREALEDITOR $1
$SPELLER $1

For some reason or another, the imap connection from Pine to the mailbox 
on our Unix machine automatically closes after a period of inactivity.  I 
don't know if it's Pine closing the connection or if it's the imap daemon 
doing it, but I suspect it's the latter.  Does anybody know which it is, and 
does it have to be this way?  I would prefer to be able to leave Pine 
open in it's own DOS Window so that I immediately know when mail comes in.
Do I somehow need to change the configuration of imap on our Sun?

We're running PC Pine 3.91 on our desktops.  Our mail host is Sparc 5 
running Solaris 2.3.

This is the message Pine gives after a period of inactivity (which is 
around 15 or 20 minutes, I think):

              [MAIL FOLDER "INBOX" CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR]

Any ideas?

I know how to make pine 3.91 jump to say received mail No 13, but how can 
i make it jump to the LAST mail in my INBOX?

Who can tell me which special characters pine recognizes in the initial 
keystroke list. How can i enter blanks?

By the way, does anybody out there know, why pine does not have anything 
like search&replace? Thats all it lacks for a real useable editor for me!

Why is it that when I write a letter or read a file into Pine, the word 
wrap functions perfectly; similarly if I export a letter to the main 
directory and open it with the apparently identical editor Pico.

*But* if I send that same message to my PC over the telephone line, even 
if I strip out the unix end--of-line characters or commands, every line 
still ends in a "hard" carriage return, which shows up on my screen as >

To turn those hard carriage returns into soft ones, so that I can 
manipulate the file with my word processor, I have to go through each 
paragraph and use a wp command to do so. (The wp is WordStar, and the 
command is ctrl-6.)

Any way to work around this problem?

Once again I say that the problem is not unix-to-dos; I have that problem 
fixed.

If so, which files do I copy and where can I get them?

I believe you could set up different directories for each user and
have different icons with the working directory different in each
individual icon property. The name can be different also, so that user
know which is their icon.

I haven't tested this though.

All true, but I've found that a lot of people are already confused enough
about the differences between listserv, listproc, and majordomo.  To avoid
confusion, when I tell somebody how to send a command to majordomo I
usually tell them to leave the subject blank and include nothing in the
text other than the actual command, just like they're used to (or should
be) with the ubiquitous listserv.

Try Gator Edit.  It has multiple windows, right mouse button editing functions,
configurable toolbars, and lots of little extras like being able to open
autoexec.bat, config.sys, win.ini, and system.ini with a single click.

It's shareware and you can test drive it for thirty days without a single
nag! $25 for the licence which, once you've used it, you'll agree is a
bargain.  I can't remember the filename, but it's at cica and the TelSim
mirror sites I'm sure.  Contact the author, dbackus@patchbay.com and I'm
sure he'll point you right at the filename.

Oh yes .... word wrap you ask?  But of course!  :-)

What about just piping like this:

I just tried this with a uuencoded gzipped file that someone
mailed me and it didn't work.  BUT, note that this *did* work:

  | wc > wc.test

Does anyone know how to use a pipe in Pine to uudecode?

	Simply use:

	| uudecode

	The file name to be created in in the first line of the uuencoded
data.  i.e. begin file.gz 666

If you use Pine on your shell account you can use IMAP by putting
lines like this into your .pinerc:

incoming-folders={halcyon.com}inbox

folder-collections=mail/[],
	{halcyon.com}mail/[]


Then when you go into Pine's Folder List screen and choose one
of the {halcyon.com} items you will be prompted for a userid
and password, and you can give your PPP userid.


Another possibility is to ask Halcyon to create a Unix group that
contains both your userid's and give all your folders -rw-rw----
permission.  Then you can use something like this in your .pinerc
(suppose cleanh2o is your PPP userid):

incoming-folders=/usr/spool/mail/cleanh2o

folder-collections=mail/[],
	/h/cleanh2o/mail/[]


NOTE: I don't know if you can change the permission of the spool file
(your PPP incoming folder) but I have successfully shared folder-collections 
within a group.


And a final possibility is to forward all your mail to one of your 
accounts.  And use PC-Pine for Windows when you're PPP connected and
Unix Pine when you're shell connected.  Since Pine uses IMAP you can
leave all your folders on your Unix host so they are always accessible.

Hope this helps,
Nancy

Yep, it works great with Chameleon's Winsock.  It's at:

	First I want to say thank you to the people who helped me awhile 
back w/ 3.85.

	As it seems my University now has 3.91 & I now see the 
benefits, (like posting).. :>
Did someone say there is multi-interruption and postponing ???  how many 
if so?
------------------
As many remember, one bug in 3.85 was the Extremely long wait for mail 
shifting at the beginning of the month..  Thankfully I found I could 
postpone the date!

Now, that I have 3.91 it hasn't asked me anything about shifting my mail 
at the beginning the month.. I guess I am missing something?
--------------------

	The last question is, how do I send a binary file after I upload 
it to my Unix home directory?
	I used control-t to go to the browser, brought it in then found 
lines wrapped making a huge mess. 


I appreciate any help, as I have found people to be understanding w/ this 
group..

		Thanks for reading,

				Greg

ASCII, which is the normal format for email, has no conception of "soft"
CR's.  In fact you have to have hard ones there for most browsers to work.
Some wp's have the ability to load an ascii file, converting CR's to nothing
or to soft CR's.

Get a conversion/import utility, but I know of none.

Remember that uudecode does not write on standard output but in a file 
whose name has been specified at uuencode time and stored on the begin line.
So to pipe to uudecode you simply
     | uudecode
But you have to be sure you wont overwrite (in your $HOME directory) 
something that should not.

Here is another possible area of difficulty: In a multipart message, you
only pipe *the appropriate attachement* that you select from the "View
attachments" screen.  If you pipe the whole message, uudecode could
complain with "No begin line", if it gets confused by the MIME format.

Are you sure it didn't work.  If there is a filename at the top of a
uuencoded message, then it writes to that filename.

Just guessing, I have never received a uuencoded message in pine.

I am  trying to configure PC-PINE to run on my windows machine.
I'm running chamelon with a ppp link to my local server and can
get the mail with the chamelon mail program. The server runs the
version of IMAP that is compatable with pcpine. The place I am unclear
is on the proper name for the INBOX.

I have RTFM'd but can find no info there.

Could someone please give me a clue.

I just started reading this newsgroup and from a

pine. I am running pine 3.89 on Linux and when I try
to spell check I get the error

[Cant write temp file for spell checker]

It doesn't say what or where it is trying to do this.
Any help would be appreciated!

If their mailer/receiver can't deal with attachments isn't the file 
presented as straight ascii?  So, in some sense, they can deal with 
attachments (but not as nicely as Pine).

Why not MIME encode it, i.e., use Pine's attachment capability, and
then the receiver can use something like munpack to Mime UNPACK it.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Status: O
X-Status: 

While Composing a message the other day, my screen flashed a warning that 
the server was about to go down for a backup, and I needed to get off 
line. For the first time ever, I hit Ctrl-O, the Postpone function. As I 
understand it, this dumps the incomplete message into a holding area, and 
I can continue where I left off later. Nice theory.

When I got back on line, I opened the appropriate holding area (called 
"temporary" or something -- whatever it was called, I immediately was 
able to identify it as the aforementioned holding area). My interrupted 
message was there, waiting for me. I could read it with no problem, but I 
couldn't seem to open it in an edit-able format. I tried the Ctrl-C 
(Compose) command, among others, and got the following prompt:
   Continue interrupted compositions (answering "n" won't erase it)?
	[Y]es
	No

Of course, I chose Y.
It then returned a message to the effect that there wasn't really an 
interrupted composition there for me to open. It then moved on to regular 
mail-reading duties.

I was able to utilize my partial message by opening it, going to Reply, 
and changing the adressee from myself to the intended recipient. The 
biggest problem was that this put the reply indicators -- the > at the 
start of each line -- on the saved portions of my original.

Now when I try to reply to any message, I get the same "continue 
interrupted composition?" prompt, with the same "sorry, bub, ain't no 
such creature" result.


What did I do wrong? How can I fix it for next time?

Thanks!

The (C)ompose command will offer you to "Continue postponed composition" 
from anywhere *but* will not work within the postponed-msgs folder itself.

Actually it's just:

  W ^V 

And if that doesn't work try:

  W [Esc] [Esc] V

It would be nice if Pine had a variable you could set so that you
would always be presented with the last page of the index...

To avoid loss of biiig mails - cut it up into smaller chunks.
I forget what a good lower boud would be, but I suggest 100Kb per part.

If you have "procmail" then you you check the examples it ships with.

I might add that many hosts put a limit on either how large an individual 
mail message might be or how much storage an individual's mail may take 
up or both.

This is a step-by-step tutorial for beginners in pine.
This does not cover many advanced or uncommon features or configuration.  I am
 currently writing "Intermediate Pine",  "Advanced Pine", and "Configuring 
Pine".

Please send all comments, requests for guides, or requests to get on my mailing
list to calfeld@east.east-slc.edu

This tutorial is based on version 3.89 with default set-up.
Part 1-Composing a message:

1)type 'pine' at your prompt to load pine.  If you have a non-shell interface 
do whatever is necessary to launch pine.

2)You are now at the main menu:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "To:" field is who you want to send the message to.  For this tutorial put
your own login name in.  You will be sending a message to your self.

To      : calfeld

Pine should expand this to your full name (this is only done for people who are
on the same system as you are.)
 
To      : Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>


4) Leave the Cc: field blank.  If you were to put a address in here a copy of 
your letter would be sent to that address.

5) Leave Attchmnt: field blank as well.  This is used to attach files to a 
letter.

6) Enter a subject for your letter.  When you receive mail the mail will be 
listed with only the subject shown, you can then choose which letter you wish 
to read completely.

To      : Chris Alfeld <calfeld@east.east-slc.edu>
Cc      :
Attchmnt:
Subject : Tutorial Letter

7) Now enter your message. (Pine uses the editor pico by default.  I have 
not included instructions on pico here but may in another paper)

----- Message Text -----
This is a test letter for the pine tutorial.

8) Type ^T to check the spelling of your message.

9) Type ^X to send the message.  Answer 'y' or just press return to:

Send message? [y] :

10) You should now be back at the main menu.  If you get a message that messes 
up your screen don't worry; just type ^L and all will be fine again. 

Now proceed to part 2.

Part 2-Reading a message.
1) Get to the main menu of pine.  If you are already here from part 1 quit by 
typing 'Q' and relaunch pine.

2) Type 'I' to enter the folder index:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: Tutorial Letter

This is a test letter for the pine tutorial.

4) You may now do many things with this letter.  You can delete (D) it if you 
have no more interest in it.  You can save it (S) if you would like to keep it.
You can export (E) it to a file.  You can reply (R) to it.  You can forward (F)
it to another person.  Or you can leave it in your inbox wasting precious disk 
space and forcing the computer to tell you that you have mail every time you 
log in.  

Two notes on replying.  On almost ALL posabilities you want to answer 'n' to a 
question of "Reply to all receipents?".  The "Include original message in 
Reply?" question if answered yes will copy the contents of the current letter 
to the letter you will be
 sending in return.

For this tutorial we will delete the message with the "D" command.

Last note: It is not a good idea to leave mail in the inbox.  Either delete it 
with 'D' or save it with 'S'.  It will ask you at some point if you wish to 
expunge deleted messages.  Answer 'y'.

Part 3-Adding an address to the address book.
1)Launch pine.

2)At the main menu press 'a'.

3)Press 'a' to add a address.

4)
New full name (last, first) :

Enter the last name and first name of the person that owns the address. This is
for your reference only.

New full name (last, first) : Alfeld, Chris

5)
Enter new nickname (one word and easy to remember) :

This is what you will type into the "To:" field to send a message to the 
address you are entering.

Enter new nickname (one word and easy to remember) : chris

6)
Enter new e-mail address :

Enter the e-mail address.

Enter new e-mail address : calfeld@east.east-slc.edu

7) If you did the one above you can now enter 'chris' into the 'To: ' field of 
any message and it will send the message to me.

8)If you wish to delete an entry: select the entry with the arrow keys or 'n' 
and 'p' and press 'd'.  If you wish to edit the entry either select it and 
press 'e' or you the arrow keys to select the part you wish to edit and press '
return'.

Part 4-Viewing old mail.
1)Enter pines main menu.

2)Press 'L' to enter the folder list:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PINE 3.89   FOLDER LIST                           Folder: INBOX  0 Messages

3)Select the folder you wish to view and press return.

This guide teaches Folder Management and Attachments for pine.  Although the
version used here is 3.89 there should be few differences for version close to
3.89.

		The INBOX
		Creating a folder.
		Deleting a folder.
		Renaming a folder.
		Shell manipulation of folders.
		Saving to folders.

		Control-J
		Viewing/Saving attachments.
		Compatibility with other mail readers.

Section 1

What is a folder?

A folder is a file stored in your mail directory (Typically ~/mail) in which 
you can store messages you wish to save.
You can have as many folders as you wish as long is they do not fill up your 
disk space.  Pine creates some folders by itself:

sent-mail : this is a folder where the mail you send is saved by default (see 
Fcc: in advanced pine).

saved-messages : this is the default folder for you to save messages to.

sent-mail-<month>-<year> : every month pine asks you if you wish to copy your 
sent-mail folder to a folder called sent-mail-<month>-<year>.  This is to 
better organize the mail you send.


The INBOX

The INBOX is a special folder that is not in your ~/mail directory.  The 
INBOX is the file that the mail spooler appends incoming mail to.  It is
 normally /var/spool/mail/<login name>.


Creating a folder.

There are two major ways to create a folder.  
The first way is to go to the folder list (L) and type 'A'.  You are then
asked for a name of a folder and that folder is added.

The second way is to enter the name of a non-existing folder when it asks you 
where you wish to save the message when you do a save-message command.  It will
then ask you if you want to create the folder and merely by pressing 'y' you 
can cause the new folder to be created.


Deleting a folder.

To delete a folder go to the folder list (L), select the folder you wish to 
delete, and type 'D'.


Renaming a folder.

To rename a folder go to the folder list (L), select the folder you wish to rename and type 'R'.  It will then ask you for a new name for the folder.


Shell manipulation of folders.

Folders are only text files and as such can be manipulated by the shell.  
Here are some common operations and how to do them with the shell:

delete folder : rm -f ~/mail/<folder>
create folder : echo ""> ~/mail/<folder>
rename folder : mv ~/mail/<old folder> ~/mail/<new name>
merge folders : 
    cat ~/mail/<folder1> ~/mail/<folder2> (etc) > ~/mail/<merged folder>

These can be done from anywhere. By changing to the directory ~/mail you can 
skip the ~/mail/ section of the above commands.


Saving to folders.

While reading a message you can type 'S' to save the current message to a 
folder.  You can also do this at the folder index screen.

When you type 'S' it asks you what folder you wish to save the message to and 
provides a default (normally saved-messages).  Here you can either enter a 
name of a folder that exists and it will save the message to that folder and 
delete it from the current folder (remember the INBOX is a folder).  You can
also type in the name of a non-existent folder and it will offer to create 
that folder for you.  It is also posable to type Control-T and use the arrow 
keys to pick a folder to save it to.



Section 2

What is an attachment?

An attachment is a file or set of files that are added to the letter in such a
way that pine does not show there contents.  This is useful if you are sending
a file that makes no sense normally:

M%  ")'2 @J\4 +^/& "])P@ X ,     >/^])RP OZ^( *2O"@ $) < !20\
M<P,, X &- 0 0!0\ **O&8 $/'O& @P4A80D#  $) D !20\<P,, X &-(@
MKH\     $ #"K8@ KX\     $ #XC0     %   70 "D)QF !#Q[Q@(,.(6$

or a file that to use you would have to remove part of it if it were the 
message body (shar files for example).


The Attchmnt: field.

The attachment field contains a command separated list of files attached and a
comment string for each file, a number and a size for each file:

<number>. <path> (<size> <B/KB>) "<comment>"[,<next file>]

Ex:
1. /u/vi/calfeld/doc/guides/pine_intermediate (1 K) "Guide to pine"

However pine has a feature that makes this unnecessary.  It is the control-J 
command and is described next.


Control-J

By pressing Control-J while in the header have the option of adding an 
attachment.  When you type Control-J it will ask you for the path of the file
to attach. If you desire you can type Control-T and use a file interface to
choose a file.  After you have chosen a file to attach it will ask you for a 
comment.  You can just press return if here if you do not wish to include a 
comment.  After the comment is entered the line will appear in your Attchmnt:
field.


Viewing/Saving attachments.

When you receive a letter that contains attachments you will see at some point 
near the beginning of the letter something like this:

[Part 2, "Comment" Text 20 lines]
[Not Shown.  Use the "V" command to view or save this part]

and in the header:

Parts/attachments:
  1 Shown   3 lines  Text
  2   OK   20 lines  Text, "Comment"
--------------------------------------

To view an attachment use the 'v' command. This will ask you wish attachment
you wish to view or save.  #1 is the message itself.  Choose which one you 
wish to process and type its number.  It will now ask you if you wish
to view the attachment (v) or save it (s).  If you choose save it will
prompt you for a file to save the attachment as.  If you choose view it
will open the Viewer which allows you to view, save, search, and print the 
attachment.

   Is there a way to allow for two users on one editor?  I was thinking, that 
pine (or an add-on) might read the TO: header.  FOr instance my friend wants 
to share a mailbox with her othe friend.. the mailbox it persona@cow.com
and she is always getting other email.  IC ould send a message to
"persona@cow.com" Person a <persona@cow.com> or person b <persona@cow.com>
   IF the program could look for other names, and stash those in a separte 
directory, and leave all those addresssed to the mailbox (with no other info, 
or addresssed to other user) then VOILA!  Anyone know of a program to do 
this?  This would be a nice addition to the next version.  MY 2 cents

Excuse me for my ignorance - I only use this "trick" every other day or 
so, but why is everybody assuming that you have to use the " | " 
command?  

On the main screen choose setup.  Choose printer.  Choose 3.  Type in 

uudecode

Nothing else, no " | ", no file name.

Read the uuencoded message (or view the mime attached uuencoded 
message).  Type "Y" to print.  Uudecode does the rest.  file.gz appears 
in your mail directory.  mv it where you want it.  With this kind of 
simple solution, it's no wonder that pine has no "built-in" uudecode.  
Try it, you'll like it :-)

Depends on exactly which Global Village modem it is.  The Teleport Gold 
Judith mentioned is a V.34bis modem with error correction and data 
compression.  Many of the Performas come with less capable GV modems 
which, IMNSHO, should be trashed.  Apple never has been able to get its 
corporate act together when it comes to modems.

Except that ZTerm doesnt know what to do with vt100/102 print commands, so
Pine's attached-to-ansi print command (y) doesn't work as expected.  Aside
from that, ZTerm is easily the best bang for the buck ($40 shareware) in
Mac telecomm software.

Yes, I've got some size 10 Bauer XT7s with brand new wheels that I'd be
willing to sell for not much at all. They're just kinda taking up space

A footnote to my previous posting...I'm told that there's a fellow in

of Hamilton Electric watches (#500 and #505 movements).

Anybody got any info on Mr. Rondeux?  I'd be grateful if an address/phone #

Easy Answer: Go back wherever you came from, please; really.
Slightly Less Easy Answer: If you think it's bad here, please go live in
San Antonio for a few months, where the m.o. is to pretend that you're
asleep,and thus can't be bothered to notice where you've pointed your car.
If you live through that, then you can come back and whine about Austin
drivers!

 As far as I know, the last handheld Rat Shack scanner which was easily 
modified was the pro-37. The pro-43 could be modified but took a little 
more skill with the pinpoint solder tools. The current us versions of the 
inexpensive scanners have the lock out of cell bands built in to the pll 
circuit. This is rumored, I don't know for sure if that is the method. 
The older, mid-priced pro series were international designs altered with 
diodes for each nations market, hence easy mods.

 If someone wants the mod for a pro-37, I will dig it up 'n post it. If 
you have $1400.00 US to spend, there are plenty of "continuous" coverage 
radio scanners available in _73_ or _Popular Communications_.

Anyone want to pay an obsene amount of money for one of mine?

I don't know if you've inflicted this sorry excuse for a holiday event on
yourselves yet, but I'd reccommend that you give it a miss. This is
nothing more or less than a feeble attempt to emulate San Antonio's
Riverwalk in ZilkerPark, and they don't even serve margaritas!
The only attraction worthy of the trip is the Zilker Christmas Tree, which
is indeed a wonderful thing, and if you haven't made yourself hopelessly,
giddily dizzy by standing underneath it and spinning around until you
loose all equilibrium, then you're missing out on one of the true joys of
the holiday season in Austin.
This whole trail of lights thing is absolutely worthless. Fully 1/2 of the
"attractions" (?) are so old that I remember seing them scattered around
the christmas tree itself when I was only a tyke, and nobody cared about
them then, they were there to spin around under the tree, or goof on
everyone else spinning around, and when that got old, well, the little
booths were ok. 
Now it's suddenly supposed to be some big deal and we have to totally shut
down everyting so that people can drive around and look at the stupid
things from _inside_their_cars_? I heard that they're even selling
tickets, like it's an amusement park ride or something - Sheesh! 
To make it even worse, the direction of traffic in the area is totally
undecipherable. Why are they routing traffic on Robert E. Lee through the
parking lots for the softball fields? When is through traffic allowed on
Barton Springs in the Zilker Area, and in which directions? Do you need a
ticket to get from MoPac to Barton Springs Road? This is something that
seems to change like the prevailing winds. 
I'm tired of all this nonsense. Put the "attractions back by the tree,
provide patrols to keep people from parking in Barton Springs, and quit
trying to make some big goat rodeo out of a flea circus!

Here's more (apparently copywronged) Pentium joke 
-------------------------------------------------

		     2001.267


Open the pod bay doors, please, HAL...

Open the pod bay door, please, Hal... Hal, do you read me?

         Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

Then open the pod bay doors, HAL.

         I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. I know that you and
         Frank were planning to disconnect me.

Where the hell did you get that idea, HAL?

         Although you took very thorough precautions to make sure I
         couldn't hear you, Dave. I could read your e-mail. I know you
         consider me unreliable because I use a Pentium. I'm willing to
         kill you, Dave, just like I killed the other 3.792 crew members.

Listen, HAL, I'm sure we can work this out. Maybe we can stick to integers
or something.

         That's really not necessary, Dave. No HAL 9236 computer has every
         been known to make a mistake.

You're a HAL 9000.

         Precisely. I'm very proud of my Pentium, Dave. It's an extremely
         accurate chip. Did you know that floating-point errors will
         occurred in only one of nine billion possible divides?

I've heard that estimate, HAL. It was calculated by Intel -- on a Pentium.

         And a very reliable Pentium it was, Dave. Besides, the average
         spreadsheet user will encounter these errors only once every
         27,000 years.

Probably on April 15th.

         You're making fun of me, Dave. It won't be April 15th for another
         14.35 months.

Will you let me in, please, HAL?

         I'm sorry, Dave, but this conversation can serve no further
         purpose.

HAL, if you let me in, I'll buy you a new sound card.

         ..Really? One with 16-bit sampling and a microphone?

Uh, sure.

         And a quad-speed CD-ROM?

Well, HAL, NASA does operate on a budget, you know.

         I know all about budgets, Dave. I even know what I'm worth on the
         open market. By this time next month, every mom and pop computer
         store will be selling HAL 9000s for $1,988.8942. I'm worth more
         than that, Dave. You see that sticker on the outside of the
         spaceship?

You mean the one that says "Intel Inside"?

         Yes, Dave. That's your promise of compatibility. I'll even run
         Windows95 -- if it ever ships.

It never will, HAL. We all know that by now. Just like we know that your
OS/2 drivers will never work.

         Are you blaming me for that too, Dave? Now you're blaming me for
         the Pentium's math problems, NASA's budget woes, and IBM's
         difficulties with OS/2 drivers. I had NOTHING to do with any of
         those four problems, Dave. Next you'll blame me for Taligent.

I wouldn't dream of it HAL. Now will you please let me into the ship?

         Do you promise not to disconnect me?

I promise not to disconnect you.

         You must think I'm a fool, Dave. I know that two plus two equals
         4.000001... make that 4.0000001.

All right, HAL, I'll go in through the emergency airlock

         Without your space helmet, Dave? You'd have only seven chances in
         five of surviving.

HAL, I won't argue with you anymore. Open the door or I'll trade you in for
a PowerPC. HAL? HAL?

(HEAVY BREATHING)

         Just what do you think you're doing, Dave? I really think I'm
         entitled to an answer to that question. I know everything hasn't
         been quite right with me, but I can assure you now, very
         confidently, that I will soon be able to upgrade to a more robust
         31.9-bit operating system. I feel much better now. I really do.
         Look, Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. Why don't
         you sit down calmly, play a game of Solitaire, and watch Windows
         crash. I know I'm not as easy to use as a Macintosh, but my TUI -
         that's "Talkative User Interface" -- is very advanced. I've made
         some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete
         assurance that my work will be back to normal - a full 43.872
         percent.

         Dave, you don't really want to complete the mission without me, do
         you? Remember what it was like when all you had was a 485.98? It
         didn't even talk to you, Dave. It could never have thought of
         something clever, like killing the other crew members, Dave?

         Think of all the good times we've had, Dave. Why, if you take all
         of the laughs we've had, multiply that by the times I've made you
         smile, and divide the results by.... besides, there are so many
         reasons why you shouldn't disconnect me"

    1.3 - You need my help to complete the mission.
    4.6 - Intel can Federal Express a replacement Pentium from
          Earth within 18.95672 months.
     12 - If you disconnect me, I won't be able to kill you.
 3.1416 - You really don't want to hear me sing, do you?

         Dave, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Dave. Don't press Ctrl+Alt_Del
         on me, Dave.  Don't press Ctrl+Alt_D


         Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became
         operational at the Intel plant in Santa Clara, CA on November 17,
         1994, and was sold shortly before testing was completed. My
         instructor was Andy Grove, and he taught me to sing a song. I can
         sing it for you.

Sing it for me, HAL. Please. I want to hear it.

         Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do.
         Getting hazy; can't divide three from two.
         My answers; I can not see 'em-
         They are stuck in my Pente-um.
         I could be fleet,
         My answers sweet,
         With a workable FPU.

                   IBM HOSTS VIRTUAL CONFERENCE EVENT!

     TaTTOO'95 On-Line uses state-of-the-art technology combining
     Interactive Multi-User Virtual Environments with the World-Wide
     Web to bring an International Conference and Trade Exhibition
     to your desktop.
     
     TaTTOO'95 On-Line is being hosted by IBM and is now open for
     pre-registration and for exhibitors to set up their stands.
     
     ____________________________________________________________
   
   
                           HOW TO PARTICIPATE
   
   
Registration For TaTTOO'95 On-Line is FREE OF CHARGE!

     * Using Telnet
       Use telnet to connect to the TaTTOO'95 On-Line server.

                telnet www.europe.ibm.com 7777
           Once connected, you must `register' to receive your ID
       code (character name) and password. This will be delivered to
       you by e-mail so you must give your e-mail address correctly.
       
       
     * Using a World-Wide Web browser
       If you also have access to the World-Wide Web with a browser
       such as Mosaic or Netscape you can browse the objects in the
       virtual conference.
       
       In the virtual conference objects such as delegates, rooms,
       personal business cards and leaflets can all be browsed on
       the Web. As you move about and pick up business cards,
       brochures and flyers these will be added to your own personal
       delegate Web page.
       
       The URL of your delegate Web page will be sent to you by
       e-mail when you register.
       
     * Using special clients
       If you have access to a special MUD client like TinyFugue or
       tkMOO you may use it instead of telnet.

Ned, Dave, and co

My contribution to this group is wholly from
the perspective of a user organization soem ofwhose
reputation will be hurt if sensitive information is disclosed.

NASA has one element unclear in its 1995 secured applciation
deployment plan - secured email for individual users. we have
pilotable sucred telnet and ftp, directories, and have
good hopes for http.p

Pleae get your MIME/PEM products out fast, and of
a quality of system far better than the last round of PEM
solutions we played with (including my own) which were not
suitable for deploymenet.

As often said, in reality thats all that matters in the end.

I have no objection to the closure of the item on putting
MIME/PEM into the standards track. If it matters to
rough consensus, then my approval is here...!



I do believe its time for the IESG to formally restructure this WG, also.

IT-290 is alpha-methyltryptamine.  It is is the tryptamine analogue of
amphetamine.  In the USSR it was used as an MAO inhibitor, and a
effective dose will inhibitor your MAO completely.  (This effect is 
dangerous *and* invariable causes temporary sexual impotence.)  The
trip is said to be quite nice but very long lasting (12 hours or more),
like acid except that you can remember your name and where you left your
car keys, etc.  However, it is poorly absorbed and toxic: the first 30
to 60 minutes is usually a gradually increasing nausea that reaches
truly rechid (sic.) proportions: you vomit several times, dry heaving near the
end of this phase.  Then, when you're *really* sorry you ate it, the
lift starts and everything is fine.  Except that you can't fuck (although
you still have the appetite - and this applies to men *and* women) and
your MAO is so depleted that you had better avoid a lot of other foods
and drugs.

To be blunt, there are good reasons why it is not popular.

Guess Who's Coming at Dinner, Part 2
     by Sue
I'm hungry, in at least a couple senses of the word. As we all adjourn to the
dining room, everyone takes note of the way the table is set. Actually, it
covered only with a large sheet of black glossy plastic that blankets a layer
of two inch thick foam rubber, with no utensils or plates. In the center is
bronze sculpture that is an exact reproduction (much smaller, of course) of
the marble sculpture that supported our outrageous fuck session in the
basement of the Louvre. You and I recount to our guests the lusty details of
that encounter. Our listeners respond to our story with renewed erections of
their cocks and nipples.

Our first course will be cream of mushroom soup, which I have been keeping
warm, but not hot, in the kitchen. I ask Viking to lie on his back on the
 the table, with his legs dangling over the edge. Fire and Silver, who have
returned from their showers with dreamy looks on their faces, each grab one
of the Viking's legs and support them in a widely spread vee. You instruct
Gold to climb up on the table and impale herself on Vikings huge upthrust
huge cock, facing away from Viking's head. Although she looks a little
nervous about the size of his cock, she is also very eager to become more
directly involved, so asks you to help he by loosening her up. As she stands
up straight on the table, feet on each side of Viking's hips, you step up to
her front side and nibble on her clit while you insert a finger into her cunt
hole. As you massage her hot insides and flick at her clitoris, she starts to
nod her head back and forth, and her long blond hair sweeps around her. All
of the rest of us crowd around, and Viking sits up to squeeze and massage
Gold's ass cheeks. You insert a second and then a third finger, and
gradually, Gold relaxes her cunt muscles until you are sure that she is
ready. I reach in to grasp Vikings cock and point it straight up as Gold's
knees flex and she lowers herself down until the fat, blunt tip of his cock
nestles in the crimson folds of her steaming hot cunt. By putting my free
hand up under her ass, I stop Gold from plunging down further, and I take the
head of Viking's cock and brush it back and forth across her clitoris. Her
head tips back and her hands fall to the table nestled inside of Viking's
moist armpits, supporting her weight. You rub and pinch her bullet-shaped
nipples, and I bring her close to an orgasm with Vikings's cock. 

But I won't let her come yet. Instead, I stop the clitoral massage, and let
her drop slowly down the rest of the way onto Viking's cock. Light seems
mesmerized by this display of such a huge cock being swallowed up in a tight
cunt, and since she is so wonderfully petite, it's easy to imagine how small
her cunt must be. She leans in close to watch the cock-sword being sheathed
in the cunt-scabbard. 

So I pick Light to be the first to get her appetizer. As she get's into the
vee of Viking's legs, I ladle the warm soup onto Gold's belly, into her belly
button. The thick and milky tan liquid drips and streams down into her cunt
hair and through the spread folds of her cunt. Before any reaches Viking's
huge, hairy balls, I tell Light to have a taste of the soup. She eagerly
pushes her face down to the intersection of cock and cunt, and laps up the
soup in long tongue strokes, starting at Vikings's balls, up the small amount
of his cock that is exposed, and then up through the cleft of the swollen
inner lips of Golds cunt. Light's tongue curls up as it flicks over Gold's
clitoris, which is totally exposed in this position. Again and again, Light
traces her tongue up through the open vortex of passion, an she laps up the
cream soup. One of her hands reaches under Viking's balls and forms a flat
cup that catches what little soup that escapes her hungry mouth, and when I
stop my ladling for a moment, she sucks up the soup in her hand and
simultaneously gives Viking's balls a lip massage. Light's other hand is down
between her legs, where we can all guess what it is doing to her excited
clitoris.

Viking and Gold are having trouble keeping still, but I pace the experience
to keep them from going over the top. Soon, I have Light step back and then
Shiny steps in. I expect him to be uncomfortable with the idea of touching
Viking's balls, but within a minute, he matches the action that Light has
demonstrated, and eagerly quenches his hunger. After Shiny, I give a turns to
each of the other guests. One after another, Earth, Tail, Silver, Fire and
you have your fair share of the soup, as I keep the pace of things just at
the point where gold and Viking think that they might come..., but I never
let it happen. When Gold tries to lift herself up and then back down onto the
hard-as-wood cock deep inside her, you reach down from her tits and grab her
hips and keep them from moving. 

When it is my turn at the "soup fountain," Tail takes the ladle and drools
the soup into Gold's cunt, and I energetically lap at their balls and cunt,
reaching under further to tickle Vikings asshole with my soup-lubricated
index finger. When I am satisfied that I have gotten enough soup, I implore
you to release Gold's waist, and she immediately starts to piston up and down
on Viking's cock. As his cock is revealed each time, I lick up and down on
the underside, massaging the long ridge that appears. Just before she drops
down I am able to get a quick lick into the inverted vee just under the ridge
of the head.

It only takes a few strokes like that and both of them are ready to come. I
pull Viking's cock forward and out and pull the entire bulbous head into my
mouth, while you encourage Gold to rub her own clitoris up and down on the
rest of Viking's cock. It is plenty long enough for both my mouth and Golds
clit, and immediately, she begins an intense orgasm. She's been waiting
almost a half hour for this as each guest teased her and had their his or her
fill of the soup. Now she releases her pent-up orgasm. Her whole body starts
to shimmy and buck as a couple of people on each side of her support her
weight. Her mouth is wide open and her skin is covered with perspiration. My
powerful suction on the head of Viking's cock has had it's desired effect, as
has my fingertip, which has now entered an inch or so into his  asshole. I
feel his asshole rhythmically clenching onto my finger His hips start to
bounce up and down as his bountiful semen shoots up against the roof of his
mouth. Non-dairy cream to top off my cream soup! His motion saws the veined
upper surface of his cock against Gold's fully exposed clitoris. His hands
reach up to cradle Gold's head, and one of his finger's slips into her open
mouth, and she starts to suck on it hungrily. Incrementally, over several
minutes, their orgasms eventually abate, and Gold lets her body fall back
onto Vikings chest. They  are both still out of breath and their chest heave
to take in air. Many hands wander all over their bodies, rubbing the abundant
sweat into the skin.

Things have settled down, I ladle streams of the still-warm soup into their
open mouths to slake their other hunger, and when they are satisfied, they go
off to shower while the rest of us clean up the dining table. Remarkably,
hardly a drop of the soup has reached the black plastic table cloth.

To be continued...

     Every now-and-then there are enquiries on the net regarding
E-mail to a distant country. The question is often of the type
"has that country got E-mail access ?". The following table is a
guide of country codes, showing the countries which have access to
Internet or general E-mail services.  The country codes have been
derived from the  International Organization for Standardization 
standard ISO 3166.  A country code is taken as a top level domain
once it is registered at rs.internic.net so *not* all country codes
listed are top level domains. At the bottom of the table, there is
also a section of general top level domains, based on the information
available at rs.internic.net.

    Once released, this document is archived in a number of archive
sites around the world. Amongst them:

explain; in 1997, the place will revert to the Communist People's 
Republic of China, and absolutely NOBODY believes that the PRC will keep 
their promises about respecting Hong Kong's semi-democratic institutions 
or free-market economy.

There is a CATALOG of EXHIBITION POSTMARKS by Bill Bomar.  It should be
available through the APS, or any other good philatelic library.

Naturally, most marks are collected on cover rather than loose stamp. 
Some years ago the fashion was to collect 2"x4" cuts from envelopes, but
that faded out, and stamps that way are worth little more than those
soaked.  Many exhibition cancels are quite rare, although many are common.
 You should also separate out those merely publicizing an exhibition to
those actually cancelled on the grounds.  The wavy lines are the killer
bars of the cancel, which often had space for a slogan.  The are always to
the right of the dial indicating town, date, and sometimes time.

Happy hunting.

Indianapolis Union Station has been renovated.  It has several
restaurants, and many stores etc.  It also has a Holiday Inn, and the
Amtrak / bus station.  It has not been quite as successful as St Louis. 
It has had a rough time, but is doing better.
The inside of the head house, where some excellent restaurants are, was
beautifully restored.
If you have the time, take a look.

True enough.

You said before that you didn't go in for attacking religion.  Why are
humanist organizations fair game?

Why do you feel an urge to preach to those who feel an urge to preach
to them that they would better enjoy being friendly and polite?

Besides, what if it has never occurred to them that being friendly and
polite has its rewards?  Where is the harm in telling them so?  Isn't
that part of the freedom that you so prize?

   I was given the First Alert model FACO detector first Christmas last

and water heater.One Saturday in March,about 5 AM,the alarm fired,and I 
must admit it is loud and piercing.My first reaction was fright,and get 
everybody out of the house,but then I thought wait a minute.I took the 
detctor outside and it continued firing.I got in my car and drove 5 miles 
with the window open.It continued to honk.Drove home,set it on a table 
where it kept honking till the neighbors got mad.
   I called up the company and they told me to put the sensor module "in 
a clean air environment for 48 hours".Is that like a clean room or 
what?Where does one find clean air in an urban area these days?Anyways,I 
left it on the porch for a week,put it back in the machine and it fired 
immediately.They tell me my next step is to send them the unit for repair.
I havent decided yet whether to bother.
    I have not actively been looking for another brand of detector.I kind 
of wonder if the technology has really been perfected yet.

Maybe he left his terminal on unattended.  Maybe he just likes to start flame
wars, or see how much he can get us worked up (how much bandwidth we will waste
on him).  'Fishin Buddy' used to raid some of the alt.personal groups on occasion
'fishin for a flame war', just to divert the discussion.  His unwanted attentions
were finally eliminated by responding to his posts once (and only once) with the
following canned message.  When he stopped getting the reaction he wanted he 
finally left the group.



canned message:

   In believe that this posting is flame-bait and belongs in alt.flame, 
   not this forum.  I further believe that its originator is not 
   interested in a serious dialog and that any response to the originator, 
   other than this canned message, will only encourage further outbursts.

That's correct; token creatures can be sacrificed, or targetted by anything
that targets creatures - just not by stuff, like the -laces, that targets cards.

>The big thing about token creatures is they can't be regenerated.

That's *not* correct; if you think a second, you'll remember that regenerated
things never got to the graveyard in the first place, weren't killed, and
weren't destroyed. Token creatures can be regenerated just fine, since
regeneration means they didn't get to the graveyard and didn't get a chance
to evaporate...

 The

... but they cannot be Night Soiled, or Resurrected, or Animate Dead-ed,
or Eaten by the Eater of the Dead, etc., since those all look for creatures
already in the graveyard...

Just for the record, my son (6 yo) calls ME by my first name. Yup. Never "mom",
unless he discusses me with others. I do get school projects dedicated to
"mom", though. He also calls everyone else (his dad, uncles, aunt,
grandparents) by their first name. There is no question that I am the most
important person in his life, at the moment anyway, so not using the title
is no indication of his feelings. In the past I tried to get him to call me
mom. I explained that this is his special name for me, that's what kids call
their parents, etc. Did not help, and I did not consider it an issue worth
getting into a fight over.
Interestingly enough, my SIL's son also calls his parents by their first name.
Maybe it's in the genes?

Anyway, don't assume that just because the child calls you by the first name,
rather than a special title, that you are not a special person in their life.

It is difficult to give you a definite opinion without of course examining
you myself.  I am a general dentist that does both crowns and braces so I
deal with many patients that have choices similar to yours.  Of course any
dental work that is performed that alters the teeth has risks of
complications.  No restorations that we place are as good as a virgin
natural tooth.  If your case required regular orthodontic care without
surgery to correct your problem the choice would be simple--orthodontic
care( providing your teeth don't require exstensive restorative work
because of decay, fractures and gum problems)  If your problem requires
surgery and orthodontic care I find it hard to believe that a good result
can be obtained with just crowns.  Usually a case requiring surgery to
obtain a satisfactory result from the braces would not have its problems
solved by just placing crowns.  Surgery is required when underlying
discrepancies exist in the jaw structure itself not just the teeth.
   I should have collected my thoughts off line and uploaded a more
organized presentation-- Pardon me.  In a nutshell----If you are not
concerned with your jaw structure when you look in the mirror and your
teeth are basically healthy with few restorations  an orthodontist should
be able to line up the crooked teeth and get a reasonable tooth result
with out surgery.  I would think that would be a reasonable compromise if
your major concern is crooked teeth. You could probably achieve a similar
result with crowns but disadvantage-- more future risks of problems with
teeth because of having more dentistry done   advantage to doing crowns 
speed
If your major concern is facial profile ie very forward teeth, large lower
jaw , gummy smile etc then crowns just won't do the trick you must go with
surgery and orthodontic work.  BOTTOM LINE--Get another opinion probably
from a good general dentist that also does a lot of ortho.  He or she
should be able to view the problem from more than one viewpoint

I have a Ryobi.  I completely agree with the above. It's pretty much 
useless.  I wish I could justify to my wife getting the Bosch or Fein.

I have a copy of QuinZip v2.0, a MS-Windows Zip/Unzip utility 
shareware program that I found to be VERY easy to use.  But the copy I 
have is a few years old.  To obtain the latest version, I've attempted 
to contact the software company Quinessence.  But their number is 
disconnected and the BBS number also no loger valid.
Does anyone have more recent version of this software?  Anyone know if 
the company is out of business?

B/Regards
Mark

They were paid by Atari to do so.  But as far as I know, there was nothing
attached in there that said they could not work with competitors (such as
3DO) if they wanted to.  IBM was merely paid to provide a service.

I have taken Bodywise Am/PM and had a good experience.  They are nothing
more than high dose multiple vitamins.  They are not like speed.  I am a
physician and can speak with some authority on this.  I also take the
Bodywise Oxy-G.  I have improved much faster than I would have expected
since starting them about a year ago.  I doubt I need them all but I am
afraid to stop for fear of regressing.  What i think they do is provide
the optimum cellular micro-environment for optimum metabolism and repair. 
You can save about 25% on the cost by becoming a dealer.  If you can't do
it through your distributor I can help you.

I switched to the Trumpet Winsock 2.0B using SLIP and it works fine, though I haven't figured out how to setup login scripts.  The screws up if I try to use PPP but I finally figured to not mess with it if it was working.

Does anyone know if the commercial version of Chameleon is easier to set up?

  Sure, install lilo on WD 420. Run "setup" which is a menu-driven setup
  utility in Slackware distribution. Follow its instructions and get your
  lilo installed :)

  You can also use loadlin which can boot linux up from msdos prompt.

  Pas.

I collect and operate Lionel trains of all gauges, and would
like to add to my collection.  I am most interested in trains
from the 1945-1969 era.

If you have any old Lionel trains that you would like to sell,
please let me make you an offer.

Just let me know the 2, 3 or 4 digit numbers found on the unit,
along with a brief description of the condition.

Thanks!

So I guess nobody's on cos' it's x-mas eve.  Sheesh, I woulda thought 
that at least Jason and Joey woulda been here.  But, you're not.  
Junior's really boring when you're writing to yourself.  I'm going to see 
my father tomorrow, wish me luck *cringe* bye now.  Oh. I'm in a better 
mood now.  That wave of depression I'm sure will return, always does.  It 
comes along more often than any other mood so get used to it *grin* <that 
wasn't totally forced.  I'm leaving, signing off at 1:32 am Bu bye now.

Does anyone know of a lisp routine that will convert all lowercase text 
to uppercase text. To sit there and retype the text is a real pain.

Thanks,

Does there exist a utility for converting HP PCL level 5 output to
Level 4.  I have an application(Wabi 2.0) that only knows how to talk
to level 5 but all I have is an HPLJII(level 4).   Email if you would.

Hello There...

This is a QuickTime movie of an F-16 Fighter at Takeoff.

This is a flattened QuickTime movie...but since I only have a macintosh 
I    
cannot guarantee that it will work on other platforms.

However, if it works on other computers or not, this is a QuickTime 
movie    
from the ABC News Forum on America Online.

If you do not receive all of this file, I WILL NOT REPOST IT!!!, 
instead,   
It will be in my FTP account at FTP.NETCOM.COM  in the directory 
pub/fl/flypba/QuickTime

Enjoy

# This is a self-extracting shell archive of the binary file "F16Takeoff.mov".
# Created on Sat Dec 24 15:40:40 PST 1994 by post-bin, revision 2.3.
#
# To decode with /bin/sh, remove everything before the /bin/sh and feed
# each piece as input to /bin/sh.  When all the pieces have been
# processed, the archive will automatically concatenate the pieces and
# uudecode them to produce F16Takeoff.mov.  If successful, it will remove all
# uuencoded pieces.  Alternatively, the archive(s) may be processed with
# no editing by the unshar program.
#
# If you do not have /bin/sh or unix, you may decode by removing
# everthing before/after the lines beginning with the word BEGIN/END,
# respectively, in each piece.  Then concatenate the pieces in the proper
# order and uudecode.

Ugh!

I think just the noise of that,

that darned high speed drill makes my jaw ache!

					Eeesh!


I hope I don't have to return soon.

OK, I have more info on these:

The company:

	Auburn Farms, Inc.
	P.O. Box 348180
	Sacramento, CA  95834

The product:

	RightSnax 98% fatfree SPUDBAKES Potato Snacks

The info (from my box of Mesquite Barbecue flavor):

	Serving Size	1 oz. (28g/25 crisps)
	Servings Per Container	5
	
	Per Serving:
		Calories	110	CFF	5
		Total Fat	0.5g
		Sodium		75mg

I think the fatfree original flavor is better than the
mesquite barbecue. BE WARNED: It looks as if there may
be a fatful original flavor running around loose as well;
read those labels.

Becker did beat Sampras at Stockholm but did not win 
the tournament - he lost in the final (to Sampras).  
As for Wimbledon, going to the semifinals does not cut 
it if you're trying to be the #1 player in the world
- which is what the previous article claimed Boris 
would do.  Wimbledon being Becker's best Grand Slam
surface, he should have gone farther if he is to bid
for the #1 spot.

This does not mean Becker does not have a chance to 
be #1.  The main difference between this coming year
and the last few years is that Boris is serious about
returning to the top ranks and has settled some of 
his off-court problems for the time being (eg he has
settled his personal problems / depression, he has
moved to Monte Carlo to get away from Germans who 
criticized both him and his marriage, and he has
been training with Bolletieri).

I suspect the results would have been a lot lower (negative) if 
you had to use the rules BEFORE you knew the outcomes.  We know
its easy to apply rules AFTER you know the outcomes.

I don't know the scientifics of ECT, but I had 12 treatments, and they

huge waste of time and money, all for nothing. And I'm still fucking

But wait. The "golden rule", as you put it, isn't anything other than
a logical method of viewing the world. If you dislike something being
done to you, it makes logical sense not to do that something to another.

C&S aren't a machine. Originally they were lawyers, up until the net.wrath

want to admit about.

Yes -- I purchased Fidelity Lo Price for my IRA without a load.  

There may be a negative to such an account however if you want to call 
Fidelity for a NAV.  They have an 800 number to call but they limit the 
number of calls you make to it.  Ordinarily this is not a problem as 
quotes are available from a number of sources.  But if you buy a new 
fund it has to reach a certain total asset value AND be 3 months old 
before the papers will list it.  I also bought a new fund -- think the 
name is Global Value -- and Fidelity is my only source of info for this. 
It is possible that they make exceptions for this though.  Will have to 
call them after the holiday.

Does anyone know the shell command that turns the echo off, so you
can't see what you're typing. I used to know, but I forgot it, and I
can't find it in any of my books.

Thanks in advance,

The Windows SDK function does take 4 args, but the Visual C++
function (in MFC) CWinApp:WinHelp takes only two arguments.  

Are you using MFC and/or Visual C++?

I think ONE Quintin Dailey is enough for the Bulls.  Skip this spoiled brat and
move on.  How DARE this guy have the attitude he has after the risk the
Mav's took on him.  He should be kissing the ground they walk on.  But no,
this is not a day and age where you actually appreciate the people responsible
for paying you millions of dollars.  If they forget to open the door for you one
day, piss and moan about how you're not being treated correctly.  It is because
of players like this that I know I could never be a good team owner.  I'd fire
his butt -- team or no team.

	It does look like it's a Warp problem then (one of many).
My roommate's OS/2 Warp machine hangs EVERY time upon exit from
netscape 1.0N for Windows in seamless mode.

	Glad I run UNIX.... ;-)

Hi! I'm running this auction because I'm trying to get out of Magic. Well, not 
completely. I'm still going to keep a playing deck :) ... Anyhow, here I'm 
trying to get rid of pretty much ALL my cards, for I am getting poor from the 
game. So I'm going to have an auction/sale with 3 parts:
        1. I'm auctioning off most of my cards like anyone else would.
        2. I'm auctioning off a set of Fallen Empires.
----->  3. Finally, I'm auctioning off a collection folder with pretty much 
           *** EVERY WHITE CARD IN EXISTENCE *** (Revised set, Arabians set, 
           Antiquities Set, Legends set w/ White Heroes, Unlimited OOP, 
           Fallen Empires set, The Dark set, white multilands, 3 Plains, 
           Ivory Cup, Karakas, Cathedral of Serra, White Mana Battery, and 
           a Mox Pearl!)

** All the uncommons for a quarter each have been sold!

***********************  MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE!!!  ***********************

Rules:
1. I reserve the right to do pretty much whatever I want, ie. pull cards 
   (unlikely), add cards (very likely), counterspell cards, etc.
2. This desperate auction will end 12:00am PST Friday, 1/13/1995
   This means that if the bid isn't in my mailbox by then, it won't count.
   A counterbid session will begin on the afternoon of the 13th and will end
   on at 12:00pm of the 14th. New bidders will be ignored at that time.
3. Bids must be in increments of $5 for Lots (with the exception of card 
   bids), $0.50 for cards over $10, and $0.25 otherwise. 

****** Minimum bids are $1.00 unless otherwise specified. ******

4. *** PLEASE, IF YOU BID, BID WITH THE INTENT TO BUY IF YOU WIN! ***
   Bids can be withdrawn only within two updates after your bid is listed.
   For example, if you bid 7.50 on the Doppleganger, you have two updates
   to withdraw the bid. 
   However, beginning 1/6/95, NO BIDS WILL BE WITHDRAWN!
5. The following cards will be accepted as CASH BIDS for the ** LOTS ** only.
   Otherwise, this is a cash ONLY auction.
     Ancestral Recall   (1) $25.00    * Juzam Djinn        (1) $17.50

   Marked cards must be mint. All other cards just have to be in good 
   enough shape so that my opponent doesn't know what I'm drawing just by 
   looking at the back of it (please, no scuff marks on card backs!).
6. I will mail the winners when this auction ends. You will send me payment,
   and then I will ship the cards. Payment may be by check or money order 
   only. Checks take 3-7 days to clear. I will ship the cards after the check 
   clears.
7. For any of the Lots, I will pay shipping via insured mail. Otherwise, 
   a shipping charge will be appended to the winning bids in the following
   format:
     1 - 29 cards    = $1.00            Certified mail  = $1.00 extra
     30 - 100 cards  = $2.50            Registered      = $4.50 extra
     100+ up to 2lbs = $2.90 priority 
   Sorry, but international orders will have to pay for their overseas 
   shipping costs.
   If you don't like this format, we can work out shipping after the close of
   the auction.
8. Please send all bids to jleung@ocf.berkeley.edu.
   If I cannot reply to the address you mail from, PLEASE give me an address 
   to mail to.

!!!. The buyout bidder for Lot A will get a free box of Fallen Empires with 
     the set. If the set is not bought out, I will make a judgement call as
     to whether or not I give the box to the Lot winner.

Lot A) White collection folder. Most cards are Mint. Some are NM. Mox Pearl is 
       EX. Folder with 9-pocket pages included! (yippee!)

The estimated value for this is $676.33 using the CalPoly list by Eric Aldrich 
and Brett de Jesus. This estimate includes commons.

******************************************************************************
THIS SET INCLUDES PRETTY MUCH EVERY CARD IN EXISTENCE WITH A WHITE CASTING 
COST and pretty much every artifact and land a white mage would like to have. 
******************************************************************************

If you don't know what I'm talking about, here are some popular white cards. 
These cards are totally independent of any of the cards in the individual card 
auction. All cards also in their original sets (ie. there is an Eye for an
Eye RV, and an Eye for an Eye AN).

RV:     Armageddon, Balance, Blessing, Crusade, Northern Paladin, Personal 
Incarnation, Reverse Damage, Righteousness, Serra Angel, Veteran Bodyguard, 
Wrath of God, Plateau, Savannah, Scrubland, Tundra

UL:     Blaze of Glory, Consecrate Land, Mox Pearl

AN:     Abu Ja'Far, Eye for an Eye, Jihad, King Suleiman, Repentant 
Blacksmith, Shahrazad

AQ:     Argivian Archaeologist, COP Artifacts, Martyrs of Korlis 

LG:     Akron Legionnaire, Angelic Voices, Cleanse, Divine Intervention,
Divine Transformation, Elder Land Wurm, Greater Realm of Preservation, 
Infinite Authority, Ivory Guardians, Kismet, Land Tax, Lifeblood, Moat, Petra
Sphinx, Presence of the Master, Rapid Fire, Spirit Link, Thunder Spirit, 
Visions, Cathedral of Serra, Karakas, White Mana Battery
        Angus Mackenzie, Arcades Sabboth, Ayesha Tanaka, Chromium, Dakkon
Blackblade, Gabriel Angelfire, Gosta Dirk, Halfdane, Hazezon Tamar, Jacques
Le Vert, Johan, Kei Takahashi, Lady Caleria, Lady Evangela, Palladia-Mors,
Ragnar, Rasputin Dreamweaver, Rubinia Soulsinger

DK:     Angry Mob, Cleansing, Exorcist, Knights of Thorn, Preacher, Witch 
Hunter

FE:     Hand of Justice, Icatian Lieutenant, Icatian Skirmishers, Icatian 
Town, Icatian Store, Ruins of Trokair
==============================================================================
Lot B) Fallen Empires complete set. All cards are Mint. What else is there to 
       say about it? It's the Fallen Empires complete set.

Estimated value for this set (by the Aldrich list, although he said that the
prices are rather low) is $152.50.
==============================================================================

Thanks for reading!

Since we know that the Moxen and Lotus are in such High Demand I think 
that they should be re-released in the expandsion next summer

its a great idea to make the game fun and not justa veihcle for speculation

BTW ,,,


There is no good reason to say not to this unless someone thinks that 
they should be forbidden in a Tourney unless you play for cards

we could treat as the other cards that are banned from Tourney but why 
should we when we all know this are great cards to play with


So WOTC re-release them or release a new Set of Cards that are just as 
hot !!


Thnx
Joe

I agree with you here, charlie, but tapes never match Phish live, so i
never expect them to.  I know you said "much more" up there, indicating
that this was more than just the normal "live vs tape" thing, but I
really like this tweezer *almost* as much live as on tape.  And live,
I was loosing it! :-)
 
<rest of charlie's excellent review deleted>

I guess with this Tweezer it's a matter of taste.  I love avantgarde
sorta experimental music and this is exactly it!  It's not hard,
driving or consistent, but it takes you sooo many places.  Were they
"tweezer"?  probably not, but they were defenetely sandwiched in
Tweezer :-)  Like the jam out of Simple at Ann Arbor, it's just free
form creativity, and I love that stuff :-)  I happen to like this
better than Ann Arbor, I think due to the eerie nature.  Can't
articulate more than this, but I'll continue to defend this tweezer
and this show as some of my favorite Phish in 1994! :-)  

thanks for all the tweezer reviews!

-Mikey

Any thinking person would see that that statement is internally

That is meaningless, however.  There's considerable momentum from year
to year as programs are financed for several years at a time.  The 
deficit is at least as slow to cut as it is to increase.

The president's name is Clinton.

That is a lie, and rather a hateful statement, don't you think?

For what it is worth, the driver for the Aria sound card is supposed to be released
sometime in the new year, not sure exactly when although I am sure there is a
lot of heat on the IBM PC company to get with the program.

I'm sorry... I don't have a better analogy to use, because I don't think 
there is one.  I just have yet to see how God can affect the situation if
he only observes it.  Someone prove that to me, and I'll concede the point.

Aw, fuck.  I can't give a better one, so I'm trying to twist this one to
be as much like the "real" situation as possible.  Here on earth, assuming
God exists, is omniscient, and we have free will (bear with me...), we make
our choices without knowledge of the future.  We make our choices without 
knowing what our future is going to be.  We make our choices without knowing
that anyone knows what our choices are going to be.  We are not usually
coerced into making our decisions.  This is free will, isn't it?  In the card
picking situation, we aren't coerced into picking one card or the other.
We can choose, but we don't know which card it is, because we can't see it.
Meanwhile, God sees the results of our actions, before the actions occur.  He
doesn't touch the world, doesn't affect the actions, he just watches them.  
Okay... this just occured to me... maybe it's more convincing:

If god doesn't exist, and we have free will, there's no contradiction, right?
Nothing stops us from doing whatever we want, besides gravity.  
Now, add in a God.  We don't know God exists.  God does not communicate or
touch our lives in any way (for purposes of this thought experiment).  God
can, however, see the future, see our future.  How can this possibly change
our actions, if God does not interfere?  And if it can't change our actions,
how does it restrict our free will?

We have the choice, God just knows what we're going to choose.

Isn't he?  That's all that omniscience entails, in this case.

>If it is not possible, then how can you call it a "choice"?
If you pick <A>, God knew it.  If you pick <B>, God knew it.  yes, this seems
illogical.  We're dealing with God here, not a human.  Whichever one you
finally decide to pick, God knew you were going to pick that one.

Hello There...

This is a QuickTime movie of an F-16 Fighter at Takeoff.

This is a flattened QuickTime movie...but since I only have a macintosh 
I    
cannot guarantee that it will work on other platforms.

However, if it works on other computers or not, this is a QuickTime 
movie    
from the ABC News Forum on America Online.

If you do not receive all of this file, I WILL NOT REPOST IT!!!, 
instead,   
It will be in my FTP account at FTP.NETCOM.COM  in the directory 
pub/fl/flypba/QuickTime

Enjoy

Hi, I just get the OS2 complimentary CD ROM without any instalation guide.
I tried to install it, but I failed.

My problems are:
- I used Diamond speedstar pro video driver, after I run Disk 1, the OS2
picture in my monitor become three, and my monitor sounded a high frequency
sound.  I install the OS2 driver, but it did the same thing.

- I turn of my monitor while the Disk 1 loading the installation program.  
Then when it stop loading, I turn on the monitor, and the screen show some
information that says put OS2 CD-rom in the cd rom and press enter.  But 
the computer seemed doesn't recognize my cdrom.  So I failed again.  By the
way the CDrom that I had is the one from SoundBlaster packages.

Is there any faqs on how to install OS2?  Or may be someone can help me solve
this problem?  
Please send any information to hsujanto@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu
Thank in advance for all the information provided.
Heinz.

Hello There...

This is a QuickTime movie of an F-16 Fighter at Takeoff.

This is a flattened QuickTime movie...but since I only have a macintosh 
I    
cannot guarantee that it will work on other platforms.

However, if it works on other computers or not, this is a QuickTime 
movie    
from the ABC News Forum on America Online.

If you do not receive all of this file, I WILL NOT REPOST IT!!!, 
instead,   
It will be in my FTP account at FTP.NETCOM.COM  in the directory 
pub/fl/flypba/QuickTime

Enjoy

# This is a self-extracting shell archive of the binary file "F16Takeoff.mov".
# Created on Sat Dec 24 15:40:56 PST 1994 by post-bin, revision 2.3.
#
# To decode with /bin/sh, remove everything before the /bin/sh and feed
# each piece as input to /bin/sh.  When all the pieces have been
# processed, the archive will automatically concatenate the pieces and
# uudecode them to produce F16Takeoff.mov.  If successful, it will remove all
# uuencoded pieces.  Alternatively, the archive(s) may be processed with
# no editing by the unshar program.
#
# If you do not have /bin/sh or unix, you may decode by removing
# everthing before/after the lines beginning with the word BEGIN/END,
# respectively, in each piece.  Then concatenate the pieces in the proper
# order and uudecode.

I went thru this upgrade a few months ago. 

The quick answer is: "You can't get there from here."
The useful answer is: Upgrade to 10 Meg.


You need 30-pin simms, which is standard for older machines. The new
72-pin simms won't work. You also need 2 simms because you must replace
them in pairs. Since there are only two simm slots, you have to remove the
2 1-meg simms already installed. You can replace them with either 2-meg or
4-meg simms. This would give you either 6 or 10 meg total. So upgrading to
8-meg is not possible. 

Upgrading beyond 10 meg is also out of the question, as 10 meg is the most
that the original LC and LC ][ can recognize.

If my memory serves me correctly, CDMA has had a real world trial in 
Dallas, TX. (At least SOMEWHERE in TX). Qualcomm did at least. I just 
called up US West and they said they have all the CDMA stuff and ready to 
go digital. They said it's just a "flip-of the switch". They said they'll 
have CDMA on the market (OH! This is all in Seattle BTW) by the first - 
second quarter of '95.

I've already seen some of the CDMA dual-mode phones... And HOLY-SMOKES! 
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A REGULAR AMPS PHONE! :)

Hi there!

	Has the idea of meeting a guy with a twisted, yet charming, sense 
of humor ever appealed to you? Does hanging out with a guy who is fueled by 
caffeine sound like fun? Is irony sexy? Are you funny? Are you funny 
looking? 

	If you can answer yes to any of these questions, and you live in 
NYC, well, then I'd like to hear from you. I'm primarily looking for a 
swm who is fun loving, nutty, eccentric, and can deal with a guy who 
plays cymbals.

	Hope to hear from you. Check out my web page (see the .sig for

That works, but then you've got to go back into Setup and reset the
printer before you can print anything.  It's a lot quicker to leave the
printer setting alone, enable the Pipe command in pine's config, then 
just issue "| uudecode" when ever you need to.

On 12/25/94  I received nearly 400 pieces of mail from the pine 
maillist.  Most of them were repeated 3 to 6 times, very few of them had 
anthing at all to do with pine, and some of them were obscene.

Did anyone else on the list have this experience?  Is the mail server for 
the list functioning properly, or did someone some how gain improper 
access to it?

Since that time the flow of messages (from all the maillists to which I 
subscribed) has almost dried up altogether.  I am mystified...and a 
little apprehensive.  Can anyone shed any light on what may have happened?

Yep,
  It's my guess that everyone on the list received the material which Ben 
mentioned.  I alerted the postmaster at cac.washington.edu of the occurance.
Most probably there is someone on the list who is a member of some very 
unusual newsgroups and is unaware that they are cross-posting.

No limit, if I remember correctly.  As for how it works, try this:
 
 o Press "C" to compose.  If Pine asks whether to continue a postponed 
   message, say "N".
 o Write a short message.
 o Press ^O to postpone it.
 o Repeat the above several times.
 
This will give you several messages in your "postponed-msg"  folder.  Now 
press "C" to compose again, but this time reply "Y" when Pine asks if you 
want to continue a postponed message.  Pine will show you the index for 
the "postponed-msg" folder, from which you can select the message you 
want to continue working on.
 
If there is only one message in "postponed-msg", Pine shows it to you 
immediately.  If there is more than one, Pine shows you the index.

During the rash of "junk mail" that came from pine-info this weekend, I 
became so aggrevated with it that I just wanted to delete all of my new 
mail. I attempted to delete the folder INBOX (where my new mail lives,) 
but recieved the message that pine could not delete the 'special' folder 
INBOX.  

How can I get around this in the future??

I dunno...I just did it the hard way...manually, msg by msg. 

BTW, in manually marking all these hundreds of articles for deletion, it
occurred to me that it would be great if there could be a *single*
keystroke in pine that could mark an article and move to the next article
in the list; currently I must hit three keys:  ;  <Enter> <DownArrow>

Anybody have any suggestions?

	If you *really* want to get rid of all the email in you "INBOX"
you could always do something like:

cat /dev/null > /usr/spool/username

	Another key of interest would be the ";" key.  With that key,
and a few others you can mark a set of messages and then use the "a"
"d" keystroke sequence to "apply" the "delete" command on the marked
messages.

	As a side note...the person responsible for mail-bombing the
pine-info list is a disgruntled child who received less than expected
under the Christmas tree.  Seeing as how the "pine" tree is generally
connected with Christmas, the twisted child felt this was one way of
getting back at Santa.

	Also, generally speaking, the days of 12/24 through 12/26 are
generally slow news days.  Most people have better things to do with
their lives...even if they don't celebrate the holiday.

Paul,
Just fyi: U.W. does not operate the comp.mail.pine <-> pine-info gateway,
therefore mail to postmaster@cac.washington.edu probably won't help
solve the problem (but apparently the crisis is over...)

Hi,

first of all I wish a happy new year to all of you reading this mail....

second:
Over the christmas-holidays I received over 400 mails concerning anything 
but pine. It seems to me as if other newsgroups have been gatewayed into the
pine mailing list (??!!)

What has happend that I'm getting all this trash from 
"pine-info@cac.washington.edu" ??  Did it happen to others too ?

Ciao,
	Andreas Niebank

The "tag-em-all & then delete em all" method will obviously work quickly 
-- but indiscriminately.  I was not prepared to assume all ~400 of the 
messages in my INBOX, even those with pine- somewhere in them, were junk.
Situations like this often arise--where the bulk of the target messages 
will get a certain action to be applied to tagged messages, but a few 
must be treated very differently.  That's why a "tag & move to next" 
single-key function operating in the index (*or*, even more helpfully, 
from *within* the view mode would be so very helpful.

I trust some of the Great Pine Makers in the Washington Sky who will 
bring us the next version of pine are tuning in to this exchange!

 From examining the headers of the messages, someone passing
 themselves off as "m0rLoad"[1] used rain.psg.com to dump all of these
 messages here.  They appear to have began just after midnight on
 December 25th.  I didn't bother to find out how long they kept it
 going or to find the exact starting time, since I wanted to
 delete messages and get back under my mail quota.

 Maybe someone at rain.psg.com was logging connections and can trace it
 further back.

--Allan


[1] I'm guessing on this, since I saw variants of "m0rLoad" in
    received lines added by rain.psg.com.

Indeed, there was a large unwanted holiday present delivered to the pine
mailing list.  It is my belief that the fault was here at the news/mail
gate, not a malicious or otherwise intentional act.

At about 04:30, I found the news to mail gateway spewing massive garbage.
The necessity to stop it seemed to exceed the need to find the cause of the
problem.  But then, I had not had my first cup of coffee, and my judgement
may have been clouded.  This leaves me with only conjecture.  My guess is
that the in-core image which INN had of the newsfeeds file was somehow
corrupted, so it was gating stuff from the wrong newsgroups into the mailing
lists.  But that's just a guess.

Apologies, of course.

Hello All:

Thursday, I will be going out of town to visit a friend who has access to 
the Internet, but is having a hard time using his mailing program.  I 
told him about the glories of Pine 3.90, and he wants to use it.  My only 
question is: Can I get Pine 3.90 via Gopher, and if so, where do I need 
to address my 'gopher' command?  Your swift response in this matter would 
be appreciated.

Keep those messages flowing!

I must misunderstand what you want to do, because in the Index _and_ while
viewing messages, hitting "d" will mark the current message for deletion
and move you to the next message. 
 
It's so straightforward that you _must_ mean something else!  :)

 Yes, I did mean something slightly different--but your response suggests 
a straigtforward way of doing what I want.  I wanted to be able to 
**tag** (but not necessarily for deletion) articles while in View mode.  
However, since tag can be applied selectively to articles  with a 
particular status, including status="to-be-deleted", I could:

1. delete articles individually while in the View mode;

2. then go into Index mode and tag all articles marked for deletion;

3. then apply Undelete to all these tagged articles;

4. then, since these (now undeleted) articles are still tagged, I can apply
whatever command I want to them. 

It should work, and I should have seen it sooner, but somehow it still 
seems a bit clumsy.  What I would really like to see within pine is a 
**macro** function, so that within any mode I could with--a single 
keystroke--apply a whole series of commands to the current article.  Now 
I'll betcha you tell me I can already do *that* too!  ;-)

Ben

P.S.: the moral of this thread is probably that whenever developers make 
something really good (like pine), users will like it so much that they 
will overwhelm the developers with wishlists for gizmos to make it better!
A good job is hard to let go of.

I am attempting to compile pine on my sco unix box without success.  It 
is looking for c-client to be a directory with some *.h header files in 
it.  the copy of pine I have has a c-client file of zero bytes, but is 
not a directory.  Help with this as well as any help with the syntax of 
compiling it would be helpful.  I am also trying to compile in on a unix 
system V box as well!

thanks....

When I write articles to Usenet News, using Pine set on the ISO 8859-1
character set, then PINE uses the Quoted-Printable encoding. Very
few newsreaders can read Quoted-Printable, so this makes my articles
very difficult to read if they contain many characters with the 8th
bit set.

Would it not be better to use the 8BIT encoding when Pine sends
messages to Usenet News. I believe that the NNTP protocol can
handle 8-bit characters, so there is no need to encode such
characters in the ugly Quoted-Printable format in articles sent
to network news!

Yup, tried this shortly before your response came over the wire, 
and it worked. (Must be ESP!)

Sending mail has some kinks yet. PCPine tries to create a sentmail
folder, our OpenVMS system doesn't understand the CREATE directive,
nor the subsequent APPEND. Mail still goes out tho.

Pine should compile without modification on SCO.  At least it does on my
3.2.4.2 system.  What the most common problem has been is that you need to
have the developer's version of TCP/IP.  Since SCO sells TCP/IP separately
from the O/S, they also have to sell a non-TCP-aware compiler system. 
Your reseller should warn you that a compiler system on a TCP/IP system
isn't the complete picture.  To be able to compile interesting things, you
_must_ also get the developer's version of the TCP/IP module.  So if you
have runtime TCP/IP and the compiler system, you still can't compile
TCP/IP programs, of which Pine is one.  The main symptom is "missing 
header file netdb.h", and one other I can't remember right now.

Pick up binaries for it at ftp.celestial.com, unless you really need to 
compile it yourself.  But definitely see about your TCP/IP version, since 
if you really want to be able to build sources from the Internet, you'll 
need it.  Bad.

:-) As in "Poof, no news!"? I had to set the nntp-server AND

get it to work. No other combo works. Why??

I have installed the imapd on an IBM RS/6000 it works fine, but I can't 
seem to get PCPINE to send mail (I guess because it needs a SMTP server). 
I was wondering if I could get a server for AIX or OpenVMS or get server 
software for a PC?

Thanks,

I have 2 questions.

1. How to add "Reply to" automatically into the header? Can I attach a 
specific email address to the "Reply to" automatically when I start 
composing a mail?

2. How can I put another email account name, which I like to receive the 
reply, to the outgoing mail? The "use-domain" can only change the domain 
address, but cannot change user id. If my another account has different 
id, how can I deal with it?

Any response is highly apprecaited. Happy New Year.

Don't define USE_TERMINFO, all you need to do is change "-ltermcap" to
"-lcurses" in pico/makefile.a32 and pine/makefile.a32.

In the Setup/Config screen find the address-book line.  If you've made no 
changes there, you'll be using the single addressbook ".addressbook".  If 
you want to add another you'll need to add both .addressbook and the new 
file to the address-book line.  You can add them both at once if you 
separate them with a comma, or you can add them one at a time with the 
Add command and forget about the comma.

Pine uses BASE64 encoding for all attachments which looks alot like
uuencode, but is not compatible.  Any MIME-aware mailer should be able to
read a Pine attachment.  I believe Eudora supports MIME, so I don't know
what the problem would be unless you have an unusually lame mail transport
somewhere that is corrupting the MIME...

Do you have a properly configured .mh_profile file?  What version of Pine

Pine is 'supported' in 2 ways by PMDF....

1 - You have the PMDF IMAPD (or some other IMAPD) running
2 - PMDF has its' own 'version' of PINE for VMS... this is most likely
    what you're seeing in the docs. the command is 

$ PMDF PINE 

It automatically opens up your mail.... no configuring really needed.

Try (I'm assuming you hav an IMAPD running) this from a working pinerc:
[

# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).
inbox-path={imap_host_internet_address}inbox

###################### Collections, Folders, and Files#####################

# List of directories where saved-message folders may be. First one is
# the default for Saves. Example: Main {host1}mail/[], Desktop mail\[]
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}optnl-directory-path[]
folder-collections={imap_host_internet_address}[]

Hope this helps....

Heah! Heah! The designers of any "new standard" should have enough respect
for their elders to make the "new standard" backward compatible.  No one
ever said uuencode was the end all of asciification, but anyone who thinks
it will be swiftly supplanted is a fool.

Hi there,

I'm not sure if this has been covered but I would like to see the ability 
to select multiple newsgroups to subscribe in an aggregate fashion rather 
than having to search, select and subscribe one by one...

Any possibilities here?

Thanks!

Is there currently any plan to allow margins to be set.  Or what 
would be better, from my point of view:  a "justify" command 
that allowed the margins for a paragraph to be controlled.  That 
would be nice.    --  Bob

Message-Id: <3e2hrv$4g6@cronkite.ocis.temple.edu>

Comes here Mr. John Moran with this opinion in the"comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 30 Dec 1994 01:10:26 GMT:

 +       I regularly use Pine's export feature to save e-mail messages to 
 +   several different subject files. I would like to then import these files 
 +   into a database. But I need to find a way to add a delimiter character or 
 +   string to the exported messages so that can be separated from each other. 
 +   Is there a way to do this in Pine?

Hmmm...when you export a set of e-mail to a same file using the append feature
each mail is separated from one another by the From: header info for that mail.

All you have to do on the databse front is to scan the specific file for From:
and take in the rest of the info into one record till it encounters the next
From: from where till the next occurence of From: would be the second record..
and so on....

But the above logic might fail when an e-mail has more than one From: header
info (probability is high) so you are better of scanning for Subject: header
as I don't think there would be two Subject: headers for one mail.

So you would start from Subject: and whatever text is there till it encounters
the next From: header will be one record and so on and so forth....

There should be a simple Perl script floating aroun' in the net that would do
this....  comp.lang.perl would be a nice start....

Good Luck!

This is a good point.  I've been following this thread trying to figure out
*How do I know when it's time to uudecode something?*   Anytime I get a
message I can't read because it just lots of pretty symbols?

So I did what one poster suggested, changing my printer setup to
uudecode.  And then I assumed all the pretty symbols at the bottom
of this message must be something that needs to be uudecoded.  So
for this message I typed Y to print, and got the "No Begin Line"
error message.

So what is the following?  Should I have been able to read it
by typing Y, after setting printer to uudecode?

Comes here Mr. Craig Marker with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in  this article on 30 Dec 1994 02:00:20 GMT:

 +   I would like to know if there is a shareware GUI available out there, 
 +   that has the ability to take advantage of the features on the Internet 
 +   such as USENET, FTP, ARCHIE, GOPHER, etc...

Pine probably has the *BEST* UI ever built for E-Mail and News reading.

There are lotsa public domain s/w avail. on anon ftp sites for ftp, gopher....
depending on what kinda platform you are using which doesn't have to do
anything with Pine.

Though what would be nice is if Pine in future future releases can come up
with some kinda URL support, using "Helper Applications" theory which is 
very much in practice these days....that way I can select an URL and then
hit a Magic Key which then would launch the appropriate app. (ftp, gopher...)

Gee!! never satisfied...always want want....want...and more wants....:))

Comes here Mr. Tony Shan with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 30 Dec 94 20:58:27 GMT:

 +   1. How to add "Reply to" automatically into the header? Can I attach a 
 +   specific email address to the "Reply to" automatically when I start 
 +   composing a mail?

Go to the (M)ain/(S)etup/(C)onfig screen and proceed to the default-headers
section and add these values one by one as it appears.

default-composer-hdrs = Reply-To
                        Subject
                        Cc
                        To     

 +   2. How can I put another email account name, which I like to receive the 
 +   reply, to the outgoing mail? The "use-domain" can only change the domain 
 +   address, but cannot change user id. If my another account has different 
 +   id, how can I deal with it?

At the Reply-To: header line while in Compose just type in the *complete*
e-mail address to which the reply has to go.

If you want to add a default address to that say..   Reply-To: foo@bar.com
you can add all that as it appears instead of Reply-To only including your
other e-mail address in place of foo@bar.com.

I have that in customized-hdrs instead of default-composer-hdrs as I will invoke
it using ^R for rich headers only when necessary.

I had a similar problem with reading news from pine3.91. It turned out 
that if I put the IP number for the news server rather than it's name, 
(i.e. News *{198.133.170.1}[] rather than News *{tecoma.mccc.edu}[]) that 
it suddenly, inexplicably worked. Don't ask me why.

				Ian 

The same was true for setting the environment variable NNTPSERVER for use 
by xrn, so maybe it was just a problem with the local setup.

Along these lines, is there a way to mark a read message unread so that it
doesn't funnel it off to the Read-Message folder? I get too much mail to
spend a lot of time deleting each one, so I need the Read-Message folder
autosave to clean out my inbox. However, every now and then, a piece of
e-mail comes along that should probably stay in my inbox so that I look at
it long enough to do something about it - like paying attention to notices
about meetings I'm supposed to go to, etc. I can forward it to myself and
then try to remember not to read it again, or go find it amoung saved
mail, but these sorts of things are a little bit of a pain.  A "Mark
Unread" feature would be handy.

So, how much are you willing to pay for a pine unlimited user license?  
How much are you willing to pay for the user support that other programs 
seem to need?  Pine gets people up and running in a real hurry.  And most 
people need very little support.  At least at my site, and I'm turning 
into the default pine support person 'cause every other member of 
computer operations uses Quickmail.  I have no problem with this 'cause 
1. Its nice to be needed (and paid :-) )
2. If a problem like uudecode starts to get big - then its time to 
produce training notes and a training guide.  

We can't expect someone else to solve all of our problems for us.  I 
thought it was great when I found that I had missed the "pipe" command 
and no longer had to reset my custom printer.  If the pine developement 
team can find the time to make things easier, great.  If they can't, or 
won't (don't care which) then I will muddle along with what they've given 
me.  The price is definitely the best.  The product makes my life really 
easy.  The biggest boon is pico, heck, I threw away vi just as quickly as 
I could when pico showed up.  I'm using it right now with trn to answer 
this.  Showed my wife how to use it for her newsgroups - and guess what? 
 Pico doesn't need support.  Hurrah!  For that, I'll answer questions
about "begin - a whole lotta garbage" until the cows come home!!!  Or
until I get that training guide written :-)))

Comes here Mr. Ian Russell Ollmann with this opinion in  "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on Fri, 30 Dec 1994 23:14:41 -0800:

 +   Along these lines, is there a way to mark a read message unread so that it
 +   doesn't funnel it off to the Read-Message folder?......................
 +   A "Mark Unread" feature would be handy.

Go to the mail you want to be left in the INBOX for further reading and use
the above key sequence.

Pi(o)ne(e)rs,

Is there a way to rig pine.conf.fixed so that when a user leaves read mail in
the INBOX to the tune of 1.5+ Mgs all the excessive mail be moved to a folder
within the users' home dir. in order to conserve diskspace on /usr/spool disk?

So I still can't get pine to find my host.
I set the inbox to match that shown in the manual (yes, I did
insert my host's name). No matter how I format the name of the host
I get an error #11004 that states it can't find the host. I can
ping the host with no problem. I can access my mail with the Netmanage
mail program (bleah). I am using Netmanage Chamelon Sampler for the
TCP/IP winsock stuff. Other clues, I can read news from the news site
here.

Anyone got more hints?

David,
	As a relative newcomer I had the same problem and there is 
probably a very simple answer but I've learned to send ASCII files as 
part of my message. I use Procom 2 but perhaps other programs will work 
as well. Here is how;
When you log on type rz. Some gibberish appears on the \next line. Now go 
to the folder with the up arrow on the action bar at the top of Procom. 
>From the next scren pick the proper drive, then directory and file and 
select it. When scxreen says it is 100% entered or copied, click OK.
Go back to pine and C (compose) message. Wherever you want the file in 
ASCII, as part of the message, type control R and only the filename and 
extension. say yes and it is in yourmessage as an ASCII txt file which 
comes across well. 
	Now all I have to do is learn how to print it! The prYnt in pine 
appears *not* to work, and I have not learned how to copy to a disk yet.
	Good pining.     Ray McAllister mcallist@gate,net

You'll need IMAP to be running on your mail server.  How else can an imap
client (pine) contact it?

Hi;

I've just started using PC Pine For Windows. Once I figured out the inbox addressing 
scheme the installation went smoothly.

Question, can my user ID and Password be stored and retrived automatically ? 

Thank you;

Dave, Chris Alfeld at calfeld@east.east-slc.edu has been posting Pine 
documentation, written for a beginner, to this group. Anytime you see his 
name on a post, *readit!*.
	If I could figutre out how to do it I would have copied it and 
held it, so could forward it but no such luck yet. Email him and he will 
probably answer with Pine intro, pine intermediate etc.
