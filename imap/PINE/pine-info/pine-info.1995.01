The upgrade option in Pine is for PC-Pine, not for the Unix version you
use on your dial-up shell account.  You need to badger your system
administrator to upgrade to Pine 3.91.  It isn't something you can do
yourself.

Date: 1 Jan 1995 22:07:56 -0500
Message-Id: <3e7qmc$rod@little-miami.iac.net>

I'm doing terminal emulation to my ISP. The default mailer is Pine. The
pipe command IS configured but I can't get piping to: sz - to work. When
I try it, the screen does display the zmodem init string, i.e *B00000....
But I can't get it to connect up to my terminal emulation program's
zmodem requestor. Piping from Elm and from Tin work just fine. The sysadmin
gave me some non-understanable explaination about why the Pine pipe command
doesn't work with 'sz'. Is the pipe command in Pine _that_ different from
that of Elm (and Tin)?

   NO !
   The separator line is not the "From:" (From-colon) header line (part
   of the mail header, in any order, and even duplicated sometimes),
   but the "Unix From" line  (From starting in column one and followed
   by a blank space).

   There is a single From line at the beginning of each message (this
   is guaranteed by a device in the mailig s/w  such that any line
   starting with From-blank is changed to >From ), followed by the
   mail header, a blank line, the mail body ... then another Unix From
   line starts the next message

Apply the following patch to Pine sources and read news by
using "pine -use_qp 0".

---------- 8< ------------- 8< ------------------ 8< ---------------

(pine-3.90-patch-8bit.txt A 940905 PSv)

Patches to pine 3.90
====================

These are patches to get the following:

* Correction to the when-to-QP-encode code: The 30% limit must be
  paired with a lower length limit, or else very short letters could
  mysteriously sometimes be BASE64-encoded, because of a too high
  non-ASCII character ratio. (For getting just this correction, see
  the changes to line 3263-3266 in send.c.)

* New command line parameters:

  -use qp [0 or 1]	Use MIME encoding quoted printable for text,
			not 8-bit. (Default XX, 0=no, 1 or [none]=yes.)
  -mime_8 [0 or 1]	If text contains 8-bit text, use
			MIME. (Default YY, 0=no, 1 or [none]=yes.)

* New config parameters (on which the XX and YY defaults above
  depends): 

	DEFAULT_NOT_USE_QUOTED_PRINTABLE - Corresponds to "-use_qp 0"

  Enable this *only* if your sending software have the ESMTP 8BITMIME
  extension avaliable and enabled. (See RFC 1425 and RFC 1426.)

	DEFAULT_USE_NON_MIME_8BIT_LOCALLY - Corresponds to "-mime_8 0"

  Enable this *only* if your sending software transforms messages to
  7-bit before sending them outside your domain, or if it transforms
  it to MIME and uses ESMTP 8BITMIME (see above).

(I do *not* take any responsibility for the functionality of Pine 3.90
after applying this patch!)

As was corresectly pointed out to me by others, the export command does 
not use the Berkley mail separator.  Unless Pine reorders the headers 
when it exports a message, the From: method will also not work reliably. 
The best method might be to pipe the message to a script which appends 
the message to the file and inserts the separator.  

The alternative may be having the program which imports the messages into 
the database parse all the headers in the file with exported messages.  
This is not a very nice solution.

  When I was mentioning the use of the "Unix From" line (see below), I 
  was NOT referring to the Pine "export" command (which exports a single 
  mail) but to the Pine "save" command !

  The "Unix From" line can be used as delimiter when parsing FOLDERS !!

Is there a way to COMPLETELY shut off the reading of news in 3.91?  We 
have to read news via NNTP from another machine and if there is some lag 
or something on that machine, it can take several minutes to start.  
Rather annoying.

What I'd like is for it NOT to build the folders, but still allow me to 
post to a newsgroup.

Can this be done?

I can't get my compiled version of PINE3.91 to work with a terminal emulation
other than vt100.  When I run pine-bin.solaris for solaris2.x it comes up
with an error message and never runs pine.  The error is:

Your terminal, of type "vp", is lacking functions needed to run pine.  And
it's not just vp but many other emulations.  I've tried pine on another
solaris machine and it works with the emulations I'm trying but my
compiled version does not.

WHAT's WRONG?

How do you set up other terminal emulations for PINE besides vt100.  
SPECIFICALLY, vp or ADDS VIEWPOINT.  Pine says that it does not support
pine.  Isn't there something I can change in the configuration file of
pine without changing my terminal emulation to something other than vt100
or vt220 or whatever.  I want to use vp.  Any ideas?

Apologies in advance if this is completely obvious...
I'm new to pine, and involved with installing it (sound fun?)

I want to setup aliases like firstname.lastname, and have found that the
file 'aliases' does this for the sendmail utility, but pine does not read this
file. Documentation is minimal, so I've been browsing for that as well.

If anyone has gotten Pine 3.91 and associated programs going on the

helpful hints.

I would prefer to clean up some of the warning messages,
and short of telling the compiler to shut up, maybe there are a few
other #defines, etc that I could set to clean up some of them before I 
start to track them down and fix them.

Once that is done, I would then
like to start doing some MINIMAL site specific changes also, in the easiest
to update method I can find.

If there is a SCO/Pine place to look, please point me in the right direction.

Thanks in advance for any help!

I am having problems using the Read File option in pine to read in a

automatically wraps all the text.  This, in turn, basically corruptes the 
uuencoded data.  Can anyone help me with this problem?

???  I must be missing something obvious here.  Do you mean quotation
marks like "this" and 'this'?  If so, then you just type them, just as 
you would in anything else.  What happens when you try to type quotation 
marks?  If they are not echoed back from the Unix box, then either your 
telecomm software is doing something strange to your Mac's keyboard 
mapping (see your telecomm software's documentation), or the Unix box is 
rejecting those characters for some reason (ask your System Administrator).
 
I use a Mac too, and use Microphone Pro (or occasionally ZTerm) telecomm 
software. I have no trouble sending quote characters to Pine and Unix.

If I am viewing a message, every minute or half minute or so the screen 
either redraws itself or makes some minor change.  With my telnet 
program, if I'm on another connection, it tells me when something changes 
on the connections I'm not looking at right now.  If I leave pine 3.91 in 
the view message screen and flip to another connection, it will soon tell 
me that something has changed on the pine connection, but it really 
hasn't.  Does anyone know what is going on and why?

- Jeff

P.S. In 3.91, is there a way to specify how often you want it to check 
for new mail?

Subject: Dumb Question: Why Does My Terminal Lock Up?
Message-Id: <berlinerD1tI1J.B51@netcom.com>
Date: Tue, 3 Jan 1995 06:58:30 GMT

I just started using PINE 3.89, and everything goes swimmingly
until I try to read news. I enter the folder list, go into
the news collection, punch return when I see the words
[ Select Here to See Expanded List ] in inverse video. And
then my terminal locks up. Can't suspend, can't kill, can't
do anything.

What foolish thing am I doing to cause the program to hang 
this way? When I set 
news-collections=News *{foo.bar.edu/nntp}[*]
where foo.bar.edu is a news server to which I have access, I
have no problems. But when I try to use my local host at
Netcom by changing the .pinerc entry to
news-collection=News *[*]
then my terminal locks up when I try to read news, like I 
said. I'm sure I'm doing something dense. I'm sure I must
have to specify the news directory, /var/spool/news, or 
something. But where? Should I be setting an environment 
variable in my .profile or something? Please forgive me for 
asking this newby question, but though I've rtfm'ed it, I'm 
honestly at a loss now. Thanks in advance.

BTW: If possible, please mail me a response, as I don't 
regularly read this newsgroup. Thanks.

	Hummm...you are using pine 3.91.  I believe the default interval
for checking for new mail was changed to 2.5 minutes or so...  In any
event, when pine 3.91 checks for new mail it will put an * in the upper
left corner.  This is maybe what you are seeing.

	You can disable the * cue in the configuration with:

	[X]  enable-mail-check-cue

	Yes, but I for got what .h file it is...   :-( ;-(

I read somewhere in the docs that Pine tries to detect if you're sitting on 
a slow modem line. If it thinks that you are, selection is marked with a -> 
instead of the usual reverse video. Have you changed modems recently or 
something? Anyway, maybe you can force Pine to display selected letters the 
way you want, but I can't help you there.

Happy New Year to all!

Anyway one of these questions may have already been answered here 
(several times) but I have (repetadly) missed it. The other question may 
not be appropriate for this gorup (and you are free to tell me so) but I 
figured that I might as well try.

1) I had been trying to set up PC-Pine about a month ago (before romping
off to CERN for HTML goo and vacation) and was told my my MIS bud that he
had not installed IMAP systme-wide. When I returned he said that IMAP is
not up and running so that we sould try to figure out how to get it 
running now that we are starting to dissimnate a SLIP/PPP package to any 
of our users who want it.

Specifically we want (I want) to set it up so that it leaves all the 
mailboxes on the server machine and leaves all the dial-up clients alone. 
Can this be done so that it reads & writes to the multiple folders in the 
~/mail directory? 

What is the syntax for this and for readin from the inbox {artsci.wustl.edu}.

I also remember something about not being able to share a .newsrc between 
Client and Server. Is this true?

2) How do you communicate with someone on an X.400 gateway? (Yes you can 
scream at me about how stupid I am for not knowing this. Hey I don't do 
Sendmail just httpd! Besides two degress in english doth not a guru make)

Thanks in advance,

Nick

Under the Pine 3.91 Config options find the option:
 
show-selected-in-boldface 

and unselect it.

Message-Id: <bparker.73.0DD32032@interaccess.com>

The instructions in the tech notes for Pine are not really clear about the 
proper use and format of the TZ environment variable for setting the correct 
local Time Zone time in msgs created by PC-Pine.

It says the TZ variable is xxxnnyyy where xxx is the abbreviation for the 
Standard (non-daylight-savings) Time Zone, nn is the offset from GMT, and yyy 
is the Daylight savings time zone abbreviation.

In my case (Illinois, USA) this should be CST-6CDT (since we are 6hrs behind 
or later than GMT)  However when I do this, PC-Pine sets the msg time to GMT+6 
which is really the correct time for India or SE Asia, not the USA.  When I 
set TZ to  CST6CDT I get the correct time setting.

I guess it is not necessary to use 2 numerals (such as 06) but what is the 
correct setting for number greater than 1 digit (e.g. 11 hrs)?

What is the correct setting for (New Zealand or Fiji) which is on the Int'l 
Date Line and +12 hrs from GMT.

What is the correct setting for Newfoundland (Canada) which is -3.5 hrs GMT?

Also, will PC-Pine automatically adjust for Daylight Savings Time periods 
(April to October) or does the TZ Variable need to be reset manually during 
that time?

Thanks.

Hello all!  I've got both pine and mailx in use on my Solaris 2.3 system 
- with one major problem:

While mailx correctly addresses the "From" field, pine omits the machine 
name.  That is, here's the From from the two mailers:

mailx:	johnson@micronet.wcu.edu
pine:	johnson@wcu.edu

I NEED pine to return address my outgoing mail by the full method: 
johnson@micronet.wcu.edu and have piddled with sendmail.cf - only to 
screw up the working mailx.  Any ideas?  I've looked into the custom 
headers but find little help on doing a system-wide customize-able header 
for the return address.

Thanks for ANY help!

An option to set the margins is on the (endless?) requested enhancements
list, but I have no idea how soon it might get to the top...

Anyone have some info on setting up an IMAP daemon on a Solaris 2.3 
workstation?  I checked the documentation (albeit somewhat quickly) and 
found no mention of IMAP, nor POP.  If there is a FAQ with this info, 
please point me to it.  The purpose is to allow PC-Pine (Winsock) to 
access email of the workstation.

I ignored them.  I have never had any troubles with the resulting 
binaries.  The int conversions it complains about are fine, since as it 
complains, it fixes them.  It's the difference in the way SCO handles 
signals, which is really only a semantic problem with which sort of error 
it returns.  Anyway, I wouldn't bang my head against it.

Not sure what you're looking for here - there aren't any site-specific 
compile-time options you can tweak - it's all done through the .pinerc, 
pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed.  I found everything I needed in the source 
tree.

	If you are running pine 3.9x then go to the setup/config menu
and set:

	    [ ]  assume-slow-link  

	That will help....

In your /etc/services file add a line like:

imap              143/tcp                         # IMAP

In your /etc/inetd.conf file add a line like:

imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/bin/imapd   imapd

(the whitespace between fields in the inetd.conf file should be tabs)

Then find the PID of the inetd process and give it a kill -1...or
simply bounce the system.

It sounds like what you want is to set nntp-server, to allow posting, and
clear news-collections by setting it to "".

Neither option is currently available, but the latter is on our list for

Check the termcap/terminfo database on your system to make sure that the 
"vp" terminal type is included.

Pine is available from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the pine directory.  The 
ipop3d server is included in the source distribution, pine.tar.Z.  For 
Solaris 2.3, add "-Dconst=" to the CFLAGS line in pine/makefile.sol 
before building.

I'm having some trouble with PC-Pine Windows and would welcome any 
suggestions.  When I attempt to send a message, the system often hangs 
and comes back with a "Waiting for response from server" message, then 
eventually times out, giving the "Break connection?" prompt.

The Pinedebug log shows "Transfer protocol error: 421 SMTP connection 
went away."

I can usually recover and send mail by exiting and restarting Pine, then 
immediately sending the postponed message.

I'm running PC-Pine Win with the Trumpet Winsock via a dialup PPP 
connection.  Any suggestions?  Is the SMTP timeout a local problem or 
something on my service provider's end?

Thanks
Roland



P.S.  Kudos to the CAC Pine Team on continuing excellent work with Pine!
I'm a long time Unix Pine user and have installed the Windows port version 
for personal use at home for compatibility and because it beats the H^&#! 
out of any commercial package available.  Nice work!

Is there any wayto set up pine to refuse exports to the hme directory? I 
run a system where we offer e-mail, but not disk space-related services 
such as ftp, etc. I was able to prevent a suspen (ctrl-Z) with an option, 
but haven't found anything for export.

Regarding:

 +  Set the read-msg-folder variable and the auto-move-read-msgs feature.

 +  P.S.  If you do this, please make sure to make the behavior very clear to 
 +  your users.  If you don't, we get flooded with bug reports ;)

Right, but that will affect each and every user. Perhaps I should have better
phrased my question which is: I want to penalise only *such* users who tend
to keep more than 1.5 Mgs worth of *read* mail in INBOX(system's mailspool)

Any user who is following proper diskspace-ettiquette by moving read mail from
INBOX to folders in his personal account space should not have that
read-msg-folder/auto-move-read-msgs p.i.b option by default IMHO.

Something like "if INBOX>1.5 Mgs move INBOX to $HOME/mail/movedmailfolder"...
Right now I have a csh script running to check that...but anyway....

Your headers indicate:

Comes here Mz. Patti Johnson with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on Tue, 3 Jan 1995 19:12:14 GMT:

 +   While mailx correctly addresses the "From" field, pine omits the machine 
 +   name.  That is, here's the From from the two mailers:

 +   mailx:	johnson@micronet.wcu.edu
 +   pine:	johnson@wcu.edu

We had the same problem, which got fixed by setting this option in Setup/Config:

user-domain = <No Value Set>

 +   I am having problems using the Read File option in pine to read in a

Hmm....looks like the problem is with the way your uuencoder works.
I uuencoded your post and copied here, check and see if your uudecoder
can decode it and the uuencoder encodes the same way.

According to the man page, running pine with the '-r' flag will
prevent exports (among other things).

If that won't suffice then you'll probably have to hack the source.
The quickest thing I could spot would be to modify the first
if-statement in the cmd_export function in mailcmd.c in the obvious
way.

I get the login for the IMAP server.

When I load pine it still complains about how it can't find the host.

I dinked around with it more this evening and find that I can go to
'L' list folders menu and ask it to open the INBOX. It then connects
to the server and asks for my password. Then is complains that
the SELECT command can't find /usr/spool/mail/droid. This is what I
was told was the name of my inbox on that system.

Any more hints?

Subject: Pine binaries

I work for a VAR and we are looking at Pine to be the mail reader we
distribute with our systems, as well as use in house.  We have clients with
several versions of Unix, including a "tweeked" version of System VII by Altos.

I just discovered (and can someone comfirm?) that Pine cannot be compiled
without a developer's version of TCP/IP.  No problem for us internally; it
works fine.  But what about our other clients?  Specifically, this weirdo
Altos Unix refuses to execute the standard Unix binary.  Do you have to tell
our client to buy the developer's version of TCP/IP?

What I'd really like is a wayy to get Pine binaries for different flavors of
Unix.  Any hints?

Subject: Adding mail header lines

I'm running pine 3.91 on a Linux system.  I want to be able to add mail header
lines as I compose a message. Typically I send mail from one system but want
replies to go elsewhere, so I want to insert a 'Reply-To:' entry in the header.

Does anyone know how I can do this? I must be just missing something.

Read your .tinrc file, in it is a line specifing the "save" directory.  
It's usually ~/News.  There's lots of good stuff in .tinrc, look it over 
carefully.						-- Paul --

The Developer's Version of TCP/IP applies only to SCO Unix.  You're 
likely to have to port Pine yourself to any platforms it doesn't already 
support.  But it supports so many so well, that you should be able to 
find a good place to start.  It sounds like you're expecting binary 
compatibility between youre various flavors of Unix - you won't get it.  
You'll pretty much need to recompile Pine for each separate OS, unless 
you know for sure beforehand it will work.

Several can be found at ftp.cac.washington.edu.  For the others, try 
crossposting here and in the system-specific newsgroup for anyone who 
might have already solved your difficulties.  But cross-platform 
development is a hard problem, and it sounds like you're going to get in 
thick.

Subject: HP/UX NFS locking problem
Date: 4 Jan 1995 15:29:19 GMT
Message-Id: <3eeesf$ce2@lion>

Our system supervisor has added some patches to our HP/UX workstations.
We use HP/UX 9.01; I have not been able to find any description of the
patches. Everything except pine works OK.

After these patches pine keeps locking up. It happens when it tries
to open a folder in my folder directory. It creates a <folder>.lock file
and nothing happens after this. It may also lock up when opening the
sent-mail folder to save a copy of outgoing mail. The same lock file
is created. The hanging process may not be killed.
 
This only happens on a workstation where my home-directory (and folder
directory) is nfs-mounted. The server is the patched hp.
The problem occurs on hps running pine 3.07 but not on suns running 3.07.
I compiled 3.91 for hp,rs6000 and sun. The problem occurs on hps and rs6000s.
Sun is still OK. Running pine on the nfs server is also OK.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. I don't think I will get any
help from HP as pine is the only program that has problems.

I'm adding a ton of new entries to my address book these days, and can 
think of a few tools that would make the process easier.  (The objective 
is to minimize wrong or stale entries).  A few come to mind right away:

- a way to exercise the SMTP "VRFY" command from the address book, so 
  that you can tell whether an address is deliverable
- an interface to finger, whois, or some other directory service
  so that you can look people up
- a more visible "comments" screen
- and of course some support for shared or remote address books.

thanks

   In fact pine is trying to enforce (but escapes are possible as shown
   above) a very reasonable thing, that is, mail is sent to somebody
   at some domain. Nobody cares about which machine is used for receiving
   the mail, and this information should not go out.

   The mail exchanger for the receiving domain should take care of
   forwarding the mail to the user machine in a way transparent and
   invisible to the sender of the mail.
   Here as in most places we receive all mails as user@ifctr.mi.cnr.it
   and the mail exchanger knows that my mail goes to poseidon, another
   guy's goes to helios and so on.
   If tomorrow I would move to another machine, or even on leave to
   another place, I'd just have to change the local alias and the rest
   of the world wouldn't even note.

   Having the machine name in the address is more or less as 
   sending somebody a letter not as

       Mr. Pinco Pallino
       Broad Street 24

   but

       Mr. Pinco Pallino
       Broad Street 24
       the second mailbox in the third row on the shelf
       in staircase E

   Don't you agree that this information should be known only to
   the porter of Broad Street 24, or the postman ?

I've got a mail message that I'd like to redirect as a post to a newsgroup.
Is this doable from pine?  I'm digging through the builtin help but haven't
found much about news features.

(I dont want to reply to the message either - just basically bounce it to

Any info appreciated!

Go to Setup/Config from the menu menu.  Go down to custom-headers

I tried this and it works identically to just doing : sz -
i.e. it doesn't work. In both cases it does fire up the host system zmodem
and it displays the init string , i.e. **B0000000000000 but then on the
next line it displays ten or so question marks. Oh, also when I do get
back to Pine it it presents me with a screen as though I had Replied to
the message and then entered ^X, i.e. the screen has quoted the message I
was trying to d/l, and at the top there is a skeleton reply message, complete
with my signature and Pine is asking if I want to send the reply. Oh, one
small detail I forgot, when the host system's zmodem fires up, prior to
display of the init sting it sends a response that the zmodem has been
initiated in batch mode. No big deal but it does appear that everything up
until that point and enen through the sending of the init string is exactly
what one would expect. Invariably if I then manually initiate the zmodem
recieve from my end, it times out. The host system's zmodem is not talking
to my end. It appears possibly that the stuff that zmodem would normally
be sending to me is somehow being sent back to Pine.

Ahhh, Pine doesn't have any capability like that.  Offhand, I would
probably put a csh/perl wrapper around Pine that made the check and did
the dirty work before invoking the real Pine.  Some small utilities that 
may be useful for copying remote folders or converting formats are:

Pine 3.92 will be mostly bug fixes and optimization, though a few new
features have been added, like ESMTP 8BITMIME support, mime.types support,
a default-saved-msg-folder variable, etc.  Over the holiday we have been
experimenting with primitive xterm mouse support... 

To answer the next question, no, we do not have an expected release date 
for Pine 3.92 yet...

	I have just set up pine for an OSF1 system. Most of it is working 
fine EXCEPT:
	I want the users on the system to report bugs directly to me 
instead of the standard bug address.  I've changed the bug-fullname and 
the bug-address in pine.conf file, but it never sees it.  The pine-degug 
file still shows the original address being read.  Where should i change 
this information?
	Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.


Happy Computing

You could compile the distribution on your in-house systems and distribute
those binaries.  That is assuming you have a system in-house that is
compatible with your client's system...

The instructions in the Pine tech-notes are incorrect with respect to sign.
TZ offsets are west of GMT, not east; thus your TZ should be "CST6CDT".

"NST3:30NDT".  The tech notes don't explain this, unfortunately.

The offset can be more than one digit, e.g. "NZST-12" for Fiji.

>Also, will PC-Pine automatically adjust for Daylight Savings Time periods 
>(April to October) or does the TZ Variable need to be reset manually during

It should figure it out automatically.

One tricky thing is what to do when the daylight savings time
switchover rules are different from the default US rules.  For New
Zealand, for example, you'll need a TZ value that is something like
"NZST-12NZDT,M10.1.0/2,M3.3.0/3", since NZ switches to summer time the
first Sunday in October at 02:00 and switch back the third Sunday in
March at 03:00.  This is all explained in the Posix 1003.1 standard,
section 8.1.1, ``Extensions to the Time Functions''.  This should
probably be covered in the Pine tech notes too.

Subject: Problems with PCPINE 3.91 and SunOS
Date: Wed, 04 Jan 1995 19:01:35 -0500
From: Larry Lentner <larry@aurore.umd.edu>

I have the packet driver version of PCPINE 3.91 that I'm using
to communicate with a Sun Sparcstation 5 running the imapd
included in the pine 3.91 distribution and sendmail 8.6.9. It's
also functioning as a nameserver, running BIND 4.9.2.

When I finish composing a message and go to send the message,
there's a 30-second delay between the time I hit send and the
time pcpine drops me back to a prompt. I had a DECstation 5000/25
running Ultrix 4.3 and BIND 4.9.2 before I replaced it with the
Sun and I didn't have this problem with the DEC.

This is causing my impatient users some major headaches. Has
anyone else experienced this as well or have any suggestions
on how I might go about fixing it?

Thanks,

	Interesting....yes.  Useful?  Maybe.  Many SMTP servers do not
allow "VRFY".  Many addresses are on the other side of Gateways and the
Gateway itself doesn't give an indication that the address is deliverable.
This goes for many addresses that are being taken care of by an MX record.
I believe that there would be too many cases of addresses being declaired
as "deliverable" when in fact they may not be deliverable.

P.S.	I like the rest of the suggestions....

 +   	I am working with a TIN newsreader and can not locate my saved

You can view/change the options set by hitting M at the Group Index Screen.
You can also manually change those by editing the .tin/tinrc file.

Comes here Mr. Lucio Chiappetti with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 4 Jan 1995 10:29:41 -0600:

 +      In fact pine is trying to enforce (but escapes are possible as shown
 +      above) a very reasonable thing, that is, mail is sent to somebody
 +      at some domain. Nobody cares about which machine is used for receiving
 +      the mail, and this information should not go out.

 +      The mail exchanger for the receiving domain should take care of
 +      forwarding the mail to the user machine in a way transparent and
 +      invisible to the sender of the mail.

Good point, but then you do require a robust mail-server which keeps routing
off all the incoming mail to respective sub-domain hosts.

Not all do have access to this yet, some notable univ. here who support this
idea are umich.edu, uiuc.edu. It would be nice if this gets standardized.

Comments, anyone ?

Nope, I disabled that as soon as I got it.  A nice thing to be able to 
disable, because with 3.89 that was happening to me every 30 seconds no 
matter where I was, and it was driving me crazy because it kept telling 
me something had changed in pine, when really nothing had.

Someone else suggested maybe it was a bad modem connection - no, I am 
using ethernet, and it doesn't only do it on my computer, but any I've tried.

I don't know what it does, but it only happens if I'm in the view message 
screen, not the index.

Yes, today we were talking about the possibility of doing ph lookups 
from within Pine 3.91, since we're running a ph server in production 
now.  

I said I'd browse through the archives at the uwashington ftp site to 
see if the topic had been raised, but (as often happens) I didn't need 
to look any further than this newsgroup.

Many thanks for the timely discussion!

	Oooopsss...there is your problem...that feature is not available
in 3.89.  Request that your service upgrade to 3.91

I normally use one printer from pine but for some mails I want to use=20
another printer. When I press "Y" for prYnt I am asked if I want to use the=
=20
command

Print message 1 using command "lp -dmuslas1"?=20

and have the opportunity to enter "Y" for "Yes", "N" for "No" or "^C" for=
=20
"Cancel". It is obvious that "Y" and "^C" means but answering "N" have=20
the same effect as "^C". Why can't i change printer by answering "N",=20
backspace or just enter another command as elsewhere in pine?

   It is not clear to me from the above if the "notable universities"
   (which are presumably very large organizations with several depart-
   ments possibly each one with its own subdomain) "support" means
   "implementation".
   I suppose somebody at washington.edu, the home of Pine, can comment
   MUCH better than I do.

   However I was NOT saying that *subdomains* shall not appear in the
   address, but that *machine names* shall not appear in the address.

   For instance I am lucio@ifctr.mi.cnr.it, and the address is
   a subdomain : 
     ifctr is the Istituto di Fisica Cosmica e Tecnologie Relative
     mi    in the Milan Area of
     cnr      the National Research Council of
     it       Italy

   I do not want to appear as "lucio@poseidon.ifctr.mi.cnr.it"
   (the machine where I receive mail), nor as "lucio@anything.ifctr.mi.cnr.it"
   (if I'm sending the mail from another machine).

   I do not either want to appear as "lucio@mi.cnr.it" or as
   "lucio@cnr.it" !!!  In this case the effort will be quite big,
   since CNR is a large AND uncoordinated organization.

   Having things dealt with at the lower level domain is instead
   very SIMPLE.
   One does not need any terribly robust mail server.

   Even we (a 30-people institute) can deal with that, just using
   Digital stock sendmail. All what we need is to enter in /etc/aliases
   on our NIS server an alias " user: user@machine" for each new
   user.
   This is a bearable load even for a surrogate volunteer part-time
   sysadm, and the turnaround to implement it is 2 minutes.

Just a thought:  about 1988-89 Chuck Forsberg (the developer of zmodem)
changed the licensing of the UNIX versions of sz/rz, etc., to say they could
only be used with licensed versions of the zmodem protocol.  Sometime after
that he recoded rz/sz to explicitly open /dev/tty rather than using stdin
and stdout the way it had in the past.  This could interfere with attempts
to pipe rz/sz.

It is better to have the older free versions that use stdio.

This fix does not work for me. When I leave the user domain unset my

useful. I am using Solaris 2.3 and Pine 3.91.

The sendmail.cf is the standard one with the bug fix to stop it truncating
domain names in the From field. This works well with elm.

(sorry folks - I couldn't reply to Tim, due to his return address - so 
I'm posting to the group)

Tim, from your message below - I'm not sure if you were asking further 
how to fix the problem or stating how you fixed it.  I'm sorry.  At any 
rate, I did find a fix - very like what "wet sprocket" wrote - but not 
exactly.  If you'd like it, let me know.  If you've got a fix, I'd like 
to compare notes.  BTW - I'm using Solaris 2.3 + Pine 3.91 too - so our 
fixes should be the same???

FYI, Pine does not try to enforce anything in this area; rather it provides
config options to accommodate whatever model is supported at your site.

There have been some subtle bugs/changes in this part of Pine's logic over
the past year or two, but the intent hasn't changed.  In current code
here's what I understand should be happening: 

If user-domain is set, then outgoing addresses will have that value on 
the right side of the @ sign in From: addresses (and when Pine completes 
a To: or Cc: address for you.)  Pine doesn't care whether the user-domain
value includes a machine name or not.  Your choice, but it must match
whatever your local MTAs will accept.

If user-domain is *not* set (in either the personal or global pine config
file), Pine uses a system call to get the host name, and will use whatever
it gets as the right-hand-side unless "use-only-domain-name" is set, in
which case it attempts to strip off the machine name. 

By the way, a common source of address config problems occurs when people
have entries in their /etc/hosts file backwards: the fully qualified name
should be first, and the short hostname second.  If these are reversed
(and user-domain is not set) then people will end up with return addresses
of the form "joe@frodo" which will cause no end of grief.

Comes here Mr. Lucio Chiappetti with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on 5 Jan 1995 07:36:09 -0600:

 +      I do not either want to appear as "lucio@mi.cnr.it" or as
 +      "lucio@cnr.it" !!!  In this case the effort will be quite big,
 +      since CNR is a large AND uncoordinated organization.

 +      Even we (a 30-people institute) can deal with that, just using
 +      Digital stock sendmail. All what we need is to enter in /etc/aliases
 +      on our NIS server an alias " user: user@machine" for each new
 +      user.


Entries in /etc/aliases ???? You gotta be kidding....
6000+ entries on the system only for this???? and I'am not even talking
about the mainframe systems yet....

Nah! that would be a primitive approach....i would prefer shrim@temple.edu
anyday!

Just set up a mail-server, and then each user send an e-mail to this server
telling to which address mail sent to user@temple.edu should be redirected to.

Suppose the user wants to switch to another host to send/recieve mail then he
should be able to change it *himself* by sending another e-mail to the server
with the new address (a la Listserv) without requiring the intervention of a
full-time Mail-Admin to make the necessary changes manually, in matter of secs.

The keyword here is flexibility.

You would hate to be pulled over for speeding on the Information SuperHighway,
wouldn't you ? :) comments ?

 +   This fix does not work for me. When I leave the user domain unset my 
 +   email to outside sites does not include a domain name which is not very 
 +   useful. I am using Solaris 2.3 and Pine 3.91.

Hmmm...your case seems to be inverted....how about this...

user-domain = your.hosts.complete.address (for ex: foo.bar.com)

and checking this option...

use-only-domain-name = Yes

Comes here Mr. Henrik Rasmussen with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this article on Thu, 5 Jan 1995 13:11:22 +0100:

 +   I normally use one printer from pine but for some mails I want to use
 +   another printer. When I press "Y" for prYnt I am asked if I want to

 +   Print message 1 using command "lp -dmuslas1"?=20

 +   and have the opportunity to enter "Y" for "Yes", "N" for "No" or "^C" for
 +   "Cancel". It is obvious that "Y" and "^C" means but answering "N" have
 +   the same effect as "^C". Why can't i change printer by answering "N",
 +   backspace or just enter another command as elsewhere in pine?

Good point!!
I use the Network LaserPrinter while at work, and the StyleWriter at home to
print and would love an option C instead of ^C to switch printers without
having to go and change the printers in the Setup.

Right now what I do is take advantage of the -p config-file flag of Pine.

pine -f .workpinerc   - while at work

pine -f .homepinerc   - while at home  

In ".workpinerc" I have printer setup to print to 'lpr -P printername'
and in ".homepinerc" I have set it to 'attached-to-ansi' printer setup.

Also in my .tcshrc I have setup aliases like
alias wp 'pine -f .workpinerc'
alias hp 'pine -f .homepinerc'

Hope this helps.

Message-Id: <3eib1h$cd3@news.asu.edu>

I am using Pine 3.91 (a newby to the net) and am having problems getting 
my printer to work with it. The printer worked fine with the previous 
version of Pine.  I am using an IBM Compatable, 486DX, 8 meg of ram, 
TCP/IP, trumpet telnet.  The modem is a Practical Peripheral 28.8.  I use 
a PPP connection to a SPARCSERVER 1000 running Solaris 2.3.  While in 
Pine, when I type "y" for print, a message "Caption Onsing" appears in the 
lower right hand corner of the screen, and everything is dumped to my 
hard disk.  I have read through all the Pine FAQs and can't come up with 
anything that closely matches my problem.  The printer is a Panasonic 
KX-P2123 which emulates an IBM Proprinter X24E.  It is a 24-pin.  Of 
course after things are dumped into the hard disk, I can then print it 
out fine, but it is an inconvenience, and I'm not too pleased about 
something just dumping to the hard disk without my control.  Under the 
Pine printer options, I have selected the "ansi" selection.  Requesting 
help within the Pine program doesn't give me mush, just tells me to make 
a selection.  I work within both MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.1 and the 
problem is the same under both platforms.  The printer works fine on-line 
with everything else; i.e., netscape, HGopher, etc.
     I would greatly appreciate any information.  Thank you. - JB

You should have a directory in your home directory called Mail (or mail). 
Try that location.

Subject: Using formail to solve private mail w/ Newsgroups header problem
Date: Thu, 5 Jan 1995 21:38:25 -0800
Message-Id: <Pine.ULT.3.91.950105211047.7915A-100000@halcyon.com>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Pine is both a newsreader and a mailer and whenever a message
sent by Pine contains a Newsgroups header, it means that the
message was posted to a newsgroup.  If a message is only
mailed it will not contain a Newsgroups header.  If you use
Pine as your mailer and you receive a message that has a
Newsgroups header, Pine will ask you if you want to reply
by posting.  Now, if everyone used Pine this would be fine.
But, since many people use NN, Tin, and TRN, which all include
a Newsgroups header in privately mailed messages, this is a
problem.  Often people answer yes to this question because
they think that they are responding to a message that was
posted, rather than just mailed.  And then someone's private
message gets posted to the world, causing all kinds of turmoil.
A future release of Pine will make it more clear to the user
about this danger, but until that happens you may want to
put something like this into your .procmailrc file:

# Useful if you use Pine as your mailer
:0 fhw
* ^Newsgroups:
* !^Message-Id:.*Pine
| formail -R Newsgroups: Originated-In-Newsgroups:


What this does is if an incoming mail message contains a
Newsgroups header and the Message-Id does not contain "Pine"
(i.e., it did get mailed by Pine) then it replaces (R) the
Newsgroups header with Originated-In-Newsgroups, followed by
the newsgroups.  Some questions:

* Any suggestion for a better header than Originated-In-Newsgroups?
* Any suggestions for improving this?
* What other newsreaders (other than nn, tin, and trn) include a
  Newsgroups header in privately mailed messages?
* Do you think this is a good example to put in the Procmail FAQ?
  If not, what's a better header munging example?

Thanks much,
Nancy

in pine: while reading your mail hit the "h" key... that will put you in

in pine... well... there is really no way... as much as you didn't

This isn't really what you want, but how 'bout this?

Run Pine from this:
#!/bin/csh -f
/path/to/pine3.91 -z -id0
if ( -e ~/articles.to.download ) then
	cd ~/articles.to.download
	if ( `ls | wc -l` ) d *  # d is sz, kermit, whatever...
endif
cd ~ ; rm -r ~/articles.to.download
#

h:
#! /bin/csh -f
# 
# Save articles for download.
# 
cat > ~/download.article.tmp
if ( -e ~/articles.to.download == 0 ) then
	cd ~ ; mkdir articles.to.download
endif
set i = 1
while ( -e articles.to.download/download.article.$i )
@ i++
end
mv ~/download.article.tmp ~/articles.to.download/download.article.$i
echo Article stored for later download...
#

Pipe each article you want to download to h.  When you quit Pine, the wrapper
starts sending the articles.

Subject: Setting up for news, upgrading pine systemwide.
Date: 6 Jan 95 17:32:37 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.789413557@gmi.edu>

First of all, although I generally think pine is a great MUA, I am
distinctly uncomfortable with it as a newsreader, preferring nn.  However I
am the one who originally installed elm and nn on our site several years
ago, followed shortly by tin, and about a year ago, pine.  Currently the
systemwide pine is 3.89, but I want to upgrade to 3.91.  

Part of what prevented me was an error message I keep getting when running
3.91 about unbalanced {.  I posted on it in the past but got no real help.
Today I finally figured it out.  It had to do with the value of
news-collections in the systemwide pine.conf file.  It was set to:

news-collections=News/[] *{$NNTPSERVER/nntp}[]

which correctly pointed 3.89 at our nntpserver, set in a global cshrc file.
However this was not being instantiated properly by 3.9{0|1}.  I had to
experiment with brackets and parens until I finally got a version that would
work correctly with both 3.89 and 3.91:

news-collections=News/[] *{${NNTPSERVER}/nntp}[]


Now I am trying to make sense of the folders issue.  Although I would expect
the immediately preceding news-collection setting to look in ~/News then at
the nntpserver, I do not seem to see any folders from my ~/News directory.
I also experimented with setting the folder-collection to:

folder-collections=Mail/[] News/[]

This latter gave me a merged list of folders from ~/Mail and ~/News, but I
could not append to the folders that I knew were in News.  Part of this may
have been because they were saved by nn, which does not by default setup a
folder in completely proper UNIX mail format.  I also could not just save to
the folders by name, so I am quite confused about the relationship between
news and folders.

The model I want, because it is most compatible with our other newsreaders
and MUAs, is to have news saved in folders in ~/News, mail saved in ~/Mail.
Then I want users to be able to open the folders of saved news in a way
distinct from their mail folders.  I know this runs against the cognitive
model that the pine team seem to be pushing, but it is the one I am most
comfortable trying to support, as an unpaid volunteer, in addition to my 12
hrs/qtr teaching load, maintaining gopher and www, and serving on about a
dozen committees.

Does anyone have any advice?

In addition to the news issues, which are what make me the most
uncomfortable, should I anticipate any other major sources of confusion from
my users if I just upgrade them from 3.89 to 3.91 without warning?

If anyone has had any success making a Wyse 50 terminal work with Pine

termcap vs. terminfo issue.  

I am using Pine on an RS/6000 (3.2.3 and 3.2.5) and have tried Pine 3.89 and 
Pine 3.91.  Per David Miller's previous response, I did make sure that the 
pico and pine makefile.a32 had "-l curses" instead of "-l termcap".  

It seems that Pine isn't using terminfo.  

Any help would be appreciated...

Hi all,

   Where is the FAQ for this group (assuming there is one), I can't
find it as far back as my feed has.

   If there isn't a FAQ I'm specifically looking for info on PINE
for VMS to work with SMTP.

Thanks,

I recently restructured my folder-collection. When moving letters to their

sorted pretty randomly. Therefore, every time I enter a folder, I have to 
press $ d to sort the letters by date the way I want them. Isn't there a way

My first reaction was that this is an excellent idea.

However, in the long run, treating messages differently based on the
originating mail software will cause a lot of confusion.  I think it would be
better if pine users would unconditionally have procmail convert the
Newsgroups header.  I suggest that they transform it to X-Newsgroups --
short and simple.

(It would be ideal if a patch for pine could be developed that would do
this transformation automatically, without requiring a procmail
filter.)

By doing so we largely preserve the original semantics of the
Newsgroups header in email, i.e., that the sender of the reply saw
something on Usenet and sent email in response, and that the recipient
of the email is not expected to post a reply to Usenet.  The basic idea
is:

     - if you get it in email, send any reply in email
     - if you see it on Usenet, 
	  either post a follow-up to Usenet
	  or send a private email reply
	  but don't do both except in unusual circumstances

>* Do you think this is a good example to put in the Procmail FAQ?

Actually this really belongs in the pine FAQ, if/when there is one.

Procmail is baroque.  Its .procmailrc file syntax is quite hard to
understand.   It's not a good match for most pine users, who want a
simple menu-driven interface that they can use without reading a
cryptic manual.  That a pine user should need to add a .forward file
entry to enable procmail, and add some cryptic lines to a .procmailrc
file, just to use pine normally, is ironic.

Date: 6 Jan 1995 18:20:11 GMT
Message-Id: <3ek1kr$1nd4@unix1.sncc.lsu.edu>

Hi,

I would like to know about how to disable alternate editor command
system wide. We want all the people accessing pine on a particular machine 
to use only pico for editing. For this purpose, I created pine.conf.fixed 
file in /usr/local/lib directory on the RS/6000 machine running AIX
with the following options :

editor=/usr/local/bin/pico
feature-list=no-enable-alternate-editor-cmd

This still does not work. The documentation says that feature-list is
additive. So users can bypass the setting and use some other editor
by creating appropriate .pinerc file. So how do I achieve the goal 
of disabling alternate editor command system wide ?

Thanks for help,
Anil

Sorry about the previous message. Tin crashed When I resized a window while 
editing.

Is there an environment variable that can be set to point to the location of 
pine.conf? The man page does not mention one. Thanks

I have some users that are using both the shareware Procomm for DOS & using 
Prowin (Procomm for windows) and both are complaining about NOT being able 
to do the 2 following things:

1) print a mail message to their local printers 

2) capture a mail message to a procomm capture file.


Many of these users want to stop using mail & only use pine, but they find 
they can't live without these features.

Any Suggestions?

FWIW, if you set
	
	nntp-server=$NNTPSERVER

and leave news-collections blank, Pine 3.91 will assume a default
news-collection.  Note that the "News/[]" in your example above is only
the nickname for the collection and does not have any other significance.

"Mail/[]" in the above example is only specifying a nickname and does not
have anything to do with the ~/Mail directory.  You have specified a
folder collection called "Mail/[]" that resides in the ~/News directory...

You can have as many folder collections as you want in Pine, but the first
one listed is the default for saves from any collection.

Sort the folder the way you want it, the Select All and Apply Save to a 
new folder to create a new folder in sorted order.  From then on, you can 
save a lot of time by just reading the folder in Arrival order (the order 
they occur in the file).

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm trying to get Pine to compile on a "tweeked" System V Unix box (it's 
old.)  Pine wants me to run the "build" script to make the files, but 
it's not finding some standard library stuff (I think.)  It's hard to 
follow the logic of the build script because a) I'm a novice and b) it's 
written to compile on several platforms, but it seems like the actual 
compile statements start with $(CC).

Here's the dumb question: where does C look for the standard libraries?  
In other words, when you have a statement like

  #include <stdlib.h>

where does C look for that?  I found a command line switch (-I) that 
allows me to specify additional paths to look in, but is there a global 
way to do this?

Maybe it has nothing to do with libraries (the errors look kinda like C 
errors.)  I have attatched two file for those who wish to take a look 
that I created thusly:

  ./build >build.out 2>build.err

I would appreciate any help.

I am sorry if I offend for asking for this on here. But where can I ftp 
pine and Pico from.  I just opened this area and did not see a FAQ to 
read on access.  I want to use it on Amateur Radio TCP/IP instead of the 
current elm and ed that I use. 

Thanks ahead of time

For me it was discovering that we had non-ANSI keyboards.  The people in 
my office are just learning to use the control-key equivilents.  It's too 
much work to change ALL our applications now.

Boy, people are really nervous about getting flamed these days.  It's 
okay; we're all friendly here.

I believe you can FPT right into cac.washington.edu and get the latest 
stuff.  Nancy, if you're listening, could you give him all the lastest?  I 
don't have it handy.

Greetings.  I got this message from one of our users:

I assume the software is checking for some appropriate ratio of new text
to included text in a follow-up to a newsgroup post.  I tested this out on
our system, incrementally adding to the new text and deleting from the 
included text.  I was still getting this error 441 quite a bit after 
I, a seasoned reader of news, felt that the ratio of new to included text 
was appropriate.

Can anyone tell me:

1. Is it Pine, or some other bit of software called by Pine, that is 
generating this message?

2. How does whatever-it-is calculate the appropriate ratio?

3. Is the some way to tweak the formula, or turn the checking off entirely?
(The latter might be preferable, as it would disallow "Ditto." posts, 
which would be fine by me.)

Thanks in advance.

There is not currently a native OS/2 version of Pine, but PC-Pine for
Windows is reported to work if you have winsock on your machine.  The FAQ

To Whoever can answer...

I am looking for a GUI for Unix-based Pine, preferably something like 
Mosaic.  

If anyone could point me in the right direction, I would really 
appreciate it.

You can set "sort-key=by-date" in the Setup/Config screen.

The Pine FAQ is available from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the pine/docs

Try this:

1. Make sure you have ALL the patches for rpc.statd, rpc.lockd, and NFS
2. On both machines (server and client), do the following, in order:
   a. kill rpc.statd
   b. kill rpc.lockd
   DO a AND b ON BOTH MACHINES BEFORE GOING TO C
   c. rm -rf /etc/sm /etc/sm.bak
   d. start rpc.statd
   e. start rpc.lockd

I am working with HP to try to find out why the sm directories are being 
corrupted-- no luck so far.  Please post a followup and let us know if 
this helps.

  I find no way to export a marked block of text from Pine message to a 
file. Is there a way?

  Will there come a time when Pine exhibits two windows on receiving the 
Reply command?: Inbox mail in the top window; reply-being-composed in 
bottom window; marked block can be transferred from one to another.

I want to change the id  in pine. For ex.

                    007@school.edu  
          
               to   Al@school.edu 
                    (I want to change or remove 007 ,is this possible?)

So far I can do this only  Al 007@school.edu
                              ^^^ still here.             



(by configuring  the option menu)


Also, is there any way to change the IP (domain) address? That is ,from
@school.edu to @home.edu for ex.? I have already tried the  config
. values , I can modify this part but once the mail is sent it cannot
leave my mail system.  I guess to send out mail , the return address
must be identifiable before mail is to leave the local host? 


Thanks
Al

You are correct, I could always just export the message I am interested in
and later download them after I quit Pine. I sounds like there is no way
to interactively download a Pine message ala Elm's pipe. The behavior of
Pine's pipe, i.e. pipe to a command and capture the output back into
a viewer, does not seem to be documented in either the man pages or in
Pine's help screens. I thought that something was broken, but now I
understand that the operation of Pine's pipe is a "feature". It would be
nice if in addition to the current operation of Pine's pipe there was an
option to do a pipe without capturing the command's stdout.

	Since there has been a bit of traffic about it recently, I figured
I'd let people know again that VMS-Pine v3.91 is available for anonymous ftp
from lenin.cc.rochester.edu.  Extracting it requires a recent version of
UNZIP, and you MUST remember to transfer it as a binary.  This version
provides improved TCPIP support, but I've found that 3.89 seems to work
better under my installation of VMS (5.4-2).  (I'm not using TCPIP support,
since I only use it for local mail and I need to talk to PMDF anyway.) BTW: 
Congratulations to the development team; it's a great program.

There are a couple of things you could try.  #1 is setting the 
user-domain variable to "micronet.wcu.edu".  #2 would be to try
setting the use-domain-name-only switch to "NO".

Hope this helps.

	I tried using the POP capability of 3.91 by specifying my INBOX

the problem, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: JOE 2.4 - Now with SuperPico mode
Message-Id: <D224M0.HAo@world.std.com>
Date: Sat, 7 Jan 1995 22:46:48 GMT

Version 2.4 of my editor is ready.  You can get it by anonymous ftp from
ftp.std.com, file: src/editors/joe2.4.tar.Z.  It probably will not appear
until the sysop comes in on monday, however.

This upstart uEMACS hack of an editor has been stealing too many of my
customers, so I've decided to fight back.  This version of JOE includes
'JPICO'- a greatly enhanced version of Pico (perhaps I should have called it
Nano or Micro?).  It includes all of the missing functions from Pico (such
as go to beginning of file and overtype mode), and generally extends the
editor while keeping reasonably close to the simple model it provides.  It
should be especially useful for editing News and mail articles since the
paragraph formatter can properly format quoted news articles.  Also JOE
normally can display the line and column number on the status line, allows
you to set the right-margin and has many other user-friendly features.

Here are the two help screens for JPICO to give you an idea of what you get:

^[ means you hit Ctrl-[ or the ESC key

CURSOR           GO TO            BLOCK      DELETE    MISC         EXIT
^B left ^F right ^[Y top of file  ^@  mark   ^D  char  ^J   format  ^X save
^P up   ^N down  ^[V end of file  ^K  cut    ^K  line  ^T   spell   ^C abort
^Y prev. screen  ^A  beg. of line ^U  paste  ^[K >line ^[T  file    ^Z shell
^V next screen   ^E  end of line  ^[U select ^[H word< ^L   refresh FILE
^[B prev. word   ^[L line No.     ^O  save   ^[D >word ^[^[ options ^O save

^[\     Repeat ^[Z Zoom in/out ^\ Meta-   ^[S Forwards  ^[< ^[> pan left/rght

This version of JOE also includes a number of improvements and bug fixes:

You can set the JOETERM environment variable to have JOE use a different
terminal type then that specified in the normal TERM environment variable.
You may want to do this since JOE can usually handle the terminal better
than other programs- for example 'rn' messes up my Xenix console if I let it
use inverse and underline, but joe doesn't.

If JOE can't find the specified termcap or terminfo entry it uses a default
extended ansi terminal type instead of giving up.  This should be useful
with the above option since many terminal emulators and PC UNIX consoles
are ansi with insert and delete line, but many terminfo and termcap
databases only provide primitive ansi or vt100.

If you compile joe for terminfo, it includes the termcap routines anyway,
and searches the termcap database (if it exists) if no terminfo entry can be
found.

JOE now starts out in read only mode if the specified file can not be
written to.

If JOE can't make a backup file, it now asks if it should save the file
anyway.

The IDLEOUT compile option is eliminated.  Instead, if the user specified
'-' on the command line, joe will use /dev/tty to open the terminal instead
of stdin/stdout.

More status line options are now available:
  The ASCII decimal and hex values of the character under the cursor
  The number of lines in the file
  What percent of the file the cursor is at
  The current byte offset into the file
  Whether rectangular block mode is enabled
  If the file is read only

A number of glitches in the 'jstar' keymap are fixed.

It is usualy the transport program that check this. This means INN,
C-News, NNTP or wathever your site use.

> 2. How does whatever-it-is calculate the appropriate ratio?

With INN, it check the number of lines witch begin with a ">" (a) and the
number of lines witch doesn't (b). If a is greater than b, you got the
error. To avoid this you can change the ">" for another symbol, add empty
lines to your answer or have a very big .sig. Note that the last two
suggestions go far agains proper Netiquette ;-).

Again with INN (I presume it's the same thing with others) you can
recompile the program with this option off. You sould ask your news
administrator.

Please wait for version 2.5 to appear.  Version 2.4 has a minor bug which
prevents you from creating new files.

Subject: Setting Followup-To header
Date: 8 Jan 1995 15:41:20 GMT
Message-Id: <3ep130$l5a@cronkite.ocis.temple.edu>

Piners,

I have added a "Followup-To" header in my customized-hdrs option.
When I post to a newsgroup, I can set the followups to go to another
newsgroup by simply typing that newsgroups name at the Followup-To:
header. It accepts the value, so far so good the article gets posted.

Then I want to Reply to this post to see if this actually works from
Pine. Nope, it takes the value in Newsgrps: header but not the other.

But when I use Tin to reply to this post, it warns me that the followups
are re-directed to another newsgroup and the newsgroup name.

Question is why does Pine ignore my Followup-To header while Tin doesn't?

	I've been using perl scripts for PGP mail in elm for a while, and I've
been told by a friend of mine that pine has PGP support built it.  Is this
true?  If not, what mechanism is used to achieve the encryption and decryption?
Also, where can I find it ... thanks for any help!

Subject: pine 3.90 eating CPU on exit
Date: 8 Jan 1995 18:49:05 GMT
Message-Id: <3epc31$d43@news.primenet.com>

My internet provider uses pine 3.90 running on BSDI.  Every time I exit  
pine, it just hangs.  It would hang as long as it could, except that i 
terminate it with a interupt (^C)

I have pine aliased to 'pine -d 0 -i -z' .. so that I don't get debug 
information (-d 0), initially i go into the incoming folder (-i) and I 
want it to respond to control-z (-z)

I just logged in twice (via PPP) to see what's happening, and did a 
'ps ugx' upon my attempt to exit pine.  Here's what I got...

USER       PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TT  STAT STARTED       TIME COMMAND
poyner   29541 82.8  0.0  1196  584 pe  R+   11:09PM    0:56.21 pine 0
poyner   29458  0.0  0.0   572  460 q2  Ss   11:08PM    0:00.68 -bash (bash)
poyner   29430  0.0  0.0   572  468 pe  Is   11:08PM    0:00.52 -bash (bash)
poyner   29681  0.0  0.0   272  200 q2  R+   11:11PM    0:00.03 ps -ugx

I believe it's the -d 0 option that causes this, but to have one process 
eating 82% CPU really isn't good for the system.  

I've also used an older (i believe) version of pine and not had this problem 
with the same command line, but that was also on Ultrix.

Anybody know what causes this?  Thanks.

Hi, there,

Is there a way to use ispell together with pine/pico?

And, is there a "standard" API for spell checkers which can provide
candidate suggestions?

Thanks.

Can you FTP?  If so, you'll find a wealth of infomation (and an answer to 
your specific question) at

  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

If you can www try

   http://www.cac.washington.edo/pine

If you can't, maybe I can dig up the old e-mail and send it to you.

Subject: True Sort of a Mailbox?
Date: 9 Jan 1995 00:15:43 GMT
Message-Id: <3epv7f$19gq@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

I have a problem in Pine 3.91 (Unix).  


I want to start downloading some of my mail folders.  Unfortunately, I
have not always moved mail into folders in the same order in which I 
received it, although I would like to download files with the messages
in that order.

The sort command seems to sort only the index on the screen, not the 
acutal order of the messages in the file.  Is there any way to change 
this so that it sorts the file itself?

I believe that one work-around is: 
Sort the index
Select all messages
Extract all selected messages into a new file
Download that new file

But I'm wondering if there's a more direct way....

Any hints?

(Please reply by email if possible...)

Thanks...

Hello Pine Folks:

I'm truly in need of help.  I want to use the packet version of
PC Pine 3.91 to connect via a SLIP connection to my school's
mail/news system.  I am using the Univ. of Minnesota's UMSLIP.COM
Packet driver for SLIP, version 2.1 and PHONE.EXE to dial into
my school's slip server.  Gopher, Minuet and DosLynx are working
great.  Whenever I try to run Pine, I get an error message stating
that BOOTP failed.  When I manually enter my IP address, gateway,
nameserver, etc., Pine returns a message stating that my INBOX cannot
be opened because the [Host cannot be found].

I can successfully run the packet version of PC Pine with the Crynwr
Packet driver for a 3c509 NIC, version 11.2.  I do not use BOOTP
when I use the Crynwr 3c509 packet driver.

Any thoughts as to what the problem is?

Grant

How would I kill all mail that comes from a certain address using
pine itself?  Does pine support killfiles?

Yes, I know I could just make a procmail recipe, but I'd like to
use just pine.

	I use a lot of lists in my addressbook and I am constantly
changing lists, and adding new lists.  Is there a way to append a
text file of addresses into the .addressbook file?  It would make 
my life a little easier (since I'm so lazy).  Also, is there a
way to send address lists to other users without them having to 
type in all of the names?

	Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

We have been using a link to ph from pine for a while now.  Its useful as-is,
but I wanted to do some work on it before I sent it to the folks at Univ
of Washington.  There are a few bugs when names aren't found and more
than one submission on the "To:" line.  Feel free to Email me if you want
the code anyway.

     Every once in a while, in the midst of composing a message, I start 
getting doubled letters on my screen (as in the subject line above). It 
seems to happen at random and often clears up in a moment or two, but 
sometimes I have to sign off and then dial up again to get it to stop. 
It's not an improper echo setting, which is all I get from the faq.  Any 
technowhizzes out there have a solution?
     Thanx in advance....

Subject: Winsock Pine lockups
Date: 9 Jan 1995 16:35:23 GMT
Message-Id: <3erokb$er5@athena.athenet.net>

Has anyone else had problems with lockups in Winsock Pine 3.91?
It seems that when various network operations take place that
pine will not be able to finish it's current operation but will
not time out either.  Examples are selecting an invalid newsgroup 
or server.  Also if I leave Pine minimized for part of a day it
will alway be hung.  When it's hung the menus will still operate
though some will be grayed including exit, no keys will work and 
quitting windows gives the error saying that the network was in use
and windows tried to restore it to it's previous state but rebooting
may be required.  I am using Pathworks 5.1 for my TCP/IP and winsock.

I need help from a PC-PINE specialist!! 

We are running PC-PINE 3.89 and FTP PCTCP 2.20 without problems. But after
installing PCPINE 3.91 over version 3.89 and trying to send mail I get
always the message: Error connecting to mail server.  Then I installed
PCPINE 3.91 from the scratch. I start PCPINE and I can send mail. I leave
the program and start again PCPINE. But I cannot send mail a second time,
always I receive the message: Error connecting to mail server:. I return
to PCPINE 3.89 and everything works fine. 

What's going on ? Has PC-PINE for FTP PCTCP a bug or do I have to upgrade
some files ? 

Somebody told me, I have to take ODIPKT 3.0. But why does v.89 work fine
and v.91 doesn't ? Several times I send a report to
pine@cac.washington.edu, but nothing. 

Can anybody help me ?
TIA, Thomas Hucke

I work at a UNIX Var and we are now using pine on sco based machines.  My 
question is do you have a version of pine that can be compiled and 
executed on an Altos 386 box, running Altos Unix System V?

Any help is appreciated...

Guys, 

Shame on you!  I understand that you're busy because people are sending 
you bullshit questions (and the amount of bullshit is much more than the 
amount of gold in it).  But still, what you've done is, well, let's say
"impolite", though some other words are on the tip of my tongue.  I 
received the AUTOMATED answer from you A WEEK (!!!) after I sent you my 
bug report!  If you use the program to automatically fetch the standard 
text as a reply-acknoledgement of receiving a report, than it shouldn't 
take A WEEK to send acknoledgement!  And if I'm wrong and you read my 
report, and than sent me this formal crap that "people are asking us 
about IRC, talk chat, disk space..." (and there was nothing about it in
my mail)...  Well, if so, than I have no words...  This is not the 
civilized way of treating people:  first you ask "Please, send us bug 
reports, we will greatly appreciate it!", and than you just pee at those 
who did answer to your soliciting and send you a letter about improving 
YOUR server.   Damn, I expect apologees!

Hope that I won't get the same text about "no disk space on your host",
etc. again.

You might try, from the root account (so you don't have to know her 
password), logging into her account and checking this phenomenon from your 
own controlled environment.  However, my first thought is to check the 
filenames in her mail/ direcory for illegal characters.  If she managed 
to create a folder whose name involves a strategic set of illegal 
characters (^S comes to mind), it could stop her connection immediately 
upon an attempt to display it.

No, that's not what Pine does.  You will want to look into message 
forwarding at the transport level.  Look into .forward (or .maildelivery 
if you're using MMDF) files on your system, or talk to the administrator 
about putting an entry in the system aliases file to automatically 
redirect incoming messages.  But Pine only reads messages once they're in 
the mailbox, and it only does that when it's told to.  It won't do any 
automatic processing when no one's logged in, and it can't touch mail 
until its already been delivered.

I am a disappointed in your response.  I have looked through your
ftp and www tools.  Other than wishing to give you a pat on the back for
pine, I really have just one request. 

IS THERE A MORE RECENT VERSION OF PINE THAT RUNS ON A SILICON GRAPHICS
MACHINE?   If so where is it in your anonymous ftp account.

In my zeal to clear out some of the backlog of messages to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu, I inadvertantly sent out a couple hundred
copies of a message that implied that a copy of the Pine FAQ could be
obtained simply by sending a message to pine-info@cac.washington.edu (via
a "Reply-To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu" header) This was done manually,
but the text of the message I am sending is a slightly modified version of
the text that will soon be sent out automatically when reports are filed
to pine-bugs from outside the University of Washington.  The automated
reply will not reference pine-info in the headers.  I am appending a copy
of the text of the message below for your reference. 

I'm sorry if this causes undue clutter on comp.mail.pine/pine-info.

This is a response to your Pine* bug report.  The purpose of this message
is to: 1) acknowledge receipt of your report, 2) apologize in advance for
the fact that you may not receive any other response to it, 3) assure you
that if it is a bug report or enhancement suggestion, we will look at it
carefully, and 4) tell you how to get more information or help. 

Pine is now used by well over a million people around the world, and
thousands more every day.  Not surprisingly, the number of messages sent
to our "pine-bugs" address has become enormous.  Since we receive no
funding to support anyone outside the University of Washington, it is no
longer possible to answer all of them individually. 

Please note that we get many questions which are not actually about Pine.
We can't help you with other programs (talk, chat, IRC), with disk space
on your system, or with unknown/invalid email addresses.  Talk with your
local computer support people about these issues. 

Below is the entry from the Pine Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list
about Pine information resources.  We hope it points you to the answers
you need.  If you would like to receive the *entire* Pine FAQ by email, 
simply REPLY to this message.

                  PINE INFORMATION  RESOURCES

For information on how to configure and use Pine, we encourage you
to read Pine's on-line help, including the Release Notes (the R command
on the Main Menu.)  In addition, those of you handy with FTP or WWW
tools may find some useful documentation on our Pine Information
Center servers:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

The Pine Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) list is available on those
servers.

Here are some additional sources of assistance:

 o Check with your local support staff.  If you are not sure how to
   contact them, try sending a very polite note to "postmaster"
   on your system, asking that your inquiry be directed to the help desk.

 o If you can't get any help from your local support staff (or you
   *are* the local support staff), consider sending a message to the

Subject: Does a Pine "Viewer" Program for PC Exist?

Hi folks.  This may sound goofy but here goes.

I prefer *not* to use all the graphical stuff via SLIP etc. that is
available because text is faster for me at 14.4.  I'm kind of a packrat
and I save all my mail.  Here's what I'd like to do: download my
saved-messages and sent-mail files from my Internet provider, store them
on floppies and then view them on my PC with a small DOS program that
looks like the Pine interface.  That way I could view the "directory" of
messages by subject line and date as though I was online.  It would keep
my workspace cleaned out, which would make my sysop happy.  The
alternative is scrolling through the entire file with a text editor or
something.  

Is there such a program for DOS?

Thanks,
Fred

	Question 1, Please help! How can I access or see what is in my "Home 
Directory"? I cannot seem to find it anywhere on either hard drive, to see
what is in it; to use it, or to delete it. Thanks a million.
	Question 2, Where or how can I get a manual for Pine?
	Question 3, When I go into rz to bring a pre-existing file into 
my home directory I sometimes end up with the Procom 2 screen telling me 
Port in use, yet I have hung up. How can I get rid of Port in use and 
continue with Procom and pine without closing everything back to C:?

Thank you for replying so quickly. Sorry about my spelling!! By the time 
I received your reply, I'd already solved the problem. I made a mistake 
when I configured pine. thanx again for your reply.

Hi All,

The question has been posted several times but I can't find a sum up of the
answers in this newsgroup so here it is again... I will post a small FAQ if
I receive enough answers :

           How to use PGP from within Pine ?

Thanks
Guy
 
PS: it's illegal to use PGP encryption of the message's bodies in France, 
    but for some security reasons people run PGP to certify emails and 
    data sent over the net.

Well, I have 2.5 up and running, and it's nice!  (I'm surprised the man

much of a difference, but I'm sure it's all there.  More kudos to Joe

Thank you, Ralph.

The incoming volumne of mail has been terrible; many days there have been
over 150 messages.  That means that just to keep up, we have to answer
mail at an average of one message every 3 minutes.  Even if many messages
can be ignored (either because the message is garbage or if it's clearly
something that some other programmer should take care of), there are the
messages which require a long, carefully-thought-out response that takes
20+ minutes.  The worst cases were the ones where the user needed
handholding; a single such user can take up a day or more, especially 
the ones who insist upon sending messages to our personal mailboxes...

And that's with not getting any *programming work* done.  I hoped to 
have IMAP4 done by early December, when I left for a one-month 
vacation.  The flood of mail made it impossible.

We hate having to send the canned message.  But there's no choice; we
have to get some work done, otherwise what with state budget cuts there
might not be a Pine team (not that getting work done is any guarantee
that the axe won't fall -- they are in a sour mood in Olympia, and axing
visible efforts as a demonstration of "trimming the fat until it hurts"
is very Politically Correct).  Please keep the bouquets and testimonials
coming -- it *does* help in justifying our continued existance!

I know there is newer pine-versions, but before I start compiling the

As a Norwegian I recieve a lot of mail using mime-characters.
This is OK in the body (and even the attachments/viewing) of the message,
but the header is *no* good. In this case the message origin is a mac,
which is not set up correctly to ISO-8859-1:

I have dumped the control characters PINE sends to a file to examine.  My 
findings are that Pine sends:

Highlight on, Cursor Position, Text, Highlight off

VT100 emulation doesn't seem to mind this syntax, however, my terminal 
wants to see:

Cursor Position, Highlight on, Text and Highlight off

Any ideas on how to change this.  I have been through all of PINE's docs 
and can't find anything, been through termcaps info on my system and 
can't find anything.

Sorry to bug in, but can a multi-parts uuencoded file be decoded
using Pine? I'm hunting for a reader that can do that. Thanks!

I seem to be having a lot of trouble releasing this version of JOE.  There
is yet another dumb problem.  If you compile it for terminfo, it doesn't
work correctly.  The fix is to replace the lines:

 a=tgoto(str,a1,a0);
 tputs(a,l,outout);

in file termcap.c with:

 a=tgoto(s,a1,a0);		/* Notice 'str' becomes 's' */
 tputs(a,l,outout);
 return;			/* Plus this 'return' is needed */

Also version 2.6 should appear some time today, which will have this fix.
Thank you for your continued patience and support :-)

We have Pine 3.91 running on a SunOS4.1.x system. When expanding 
the News Collection folder I get

  [ ** Empty List **  Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]

message.  But when telnet to port 119 (for nntp services) on the 
news server, I can see the news group listing.

Any suggestions ...

Thanks

First of all, congratulations to the Pine folks. I've been using Elm and Nn
for e-mail / news, and I have just installed Pine (10 minutes of work) -- and
it really surprised me that the thing runs. In fact, it runs like a dream.

I have however a couple of questions. Please bear with me, I'm a novice
concerning Pine. RTFM-pointers are welcome too, though I'd prefer an
explanation.

(1) I am using X-windows (Pine in an xterm window) and I _hate_ the reverse
video displays that Pine uses. I managed to eliminate the reverse video as far
as selected articles/mails go, but the main menu and other menus still use
reverse video. Isn't there a better way? Even my non-X "man" can do
underlines and boldfaces instead of reverse video!

A _big_ request: how do I get Pine to discard reverse video completely, but
use other termcap capabilities (e.g., color changes, boldface, or even
underlining) instead?

(2) When I use function keys (-k switch) I get rubbish, Pine fails to
recognize them. I _know_ that I'm not using a proper VT100, but that should
not matter. My /etc/termcap (yes, I've compiled Pine with termcap support, not
terminfo) is correct though; e.g., my favorite editor Jove recognizes :k1, :k2
etc. correctly and translates the corresponding escape sequences to the right
keys.

So, another _big_ request: Pine should check /etc/termcap (if compiled so) and
match incoming escape sequences to the keys stated there! Not hardwire F1, F2
etc!

(3) I've set up Pine to get newsfeed from another cite. Pine seems to retrieve
all messages when opening the corresponding folder! That's not really what I
want. I've set up nn (nnmaster, nnadmin etc.) in such a way that _only_ the
article titles are retrieved from the newsfeeder; the actual article is only
requested when I want to read it.

How do I get Pine to emulate such behavior?

(4) Can Pine mark all the articles in a newsgroup as "read" at once? I would
like this capability when I come home from a vacation, and get thousands of
articles in some groups.. I just want to mark "all" as "read" and restart
fresh the next day.

Anyway, again: great work, Pine group. I am really extremely pleased,
especially with the installation ease and simple usage.

Please reply by e-mail (preferred) -- I am likely to miss follow-ups.

I would think doing something like:

cat text.file >> .addressbook 

would do it.  

I don't quite understand the second part of what you are asking.

However, since I am at it, I will ask a question of my own:

In the index screen, we get a flag (N,D,A etc), the sender, the size
and the subject.  What exactly is that size indicating, and is there a
way to change it to reflect the number of LINES in the mail message?

Subject: advice

I would appreciate some assistance and advice in setting up a 486 system
with the PC Pine programme.  The system now uses a uupc programe to tie into
what I believe is individual mail addresses for some doctors (10) I work
with here in Bratislava.  There is no technical support for the system and
I am asked to help make the system more user friendly.  The pc uses a
phone line to dial into the mail addresses at another site and is very
cumbersom and user un friendly.  Windows 3.1 is being used on the pc and I
would like to install pc pine for windows and hopefully make it easier.  I
have downloaded the pc pine for windows on my pc and also, mosaic and
trumpet winsock.  My problem is I am unsure as how to set up pine to dial
out to the remote site and process the email.

Thank you for your attention and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

Terry Gray gave a clear explanation last week of what pine does 
with the address to the right of the @.

Can he or anyone else describe how I can change the text to 
the left of the @? ie the username. 

My site runs a central mailer which knows about us all by name 
eg mail to me as j.c.gordon@rl.ac.uk is directed to my preferred mailbox.
This all works fine and I use some MUAs which allow me to have a From: field
of <j.c.gordon@rl.ac.uk>. Eudora and PC-PINE allow this. This way I only 
have to look in one place for incoming mail no matter how many machines 
I send from.

Q: Can I achieve this with PINE on Unix?

I know that I can add a Reply-To: header but this doesn't catch all the 
people who use useful tools like PINE's Takeaddress to copy From fields
out of mail headers into addressbooks or nickname files.

Pine does this if you make the ASCII file an attachment of the 
message. If you just include the ASCII file in the message, this
doesn't happen.

I solved this annoyance by teaching my MTA to decode C-T: text/plain
C-T-E: BASE64 to C-T-E: 7 or 8bit (depending on the charset).

Subject: How do I set up my sendmail host for PCPINE
X-Incognito-Sn: 1000
X-Incognito-Format: VERSION=2.00 EAP-1 ENCRYPTED=NO

I am trying to set up PCPINE on my network.

I use Winsock from a several vendors.

My mailhost is a Sun SPARCServer20 running Solaris 2.3.  \

PINE runs fine on the SPARC, and if you telnet to the SPARC.
                                                           
I read the FAQ and README files for PCPINE, and see that I have to set up an 
INBOX on my sendmail host.

How do I set up these INBOX's and how do I give permission/allow connection 
to the SUN box for PCPINE to open this INBOX?

I work for the State government, and we are attempting to set up mail 
accounts for all 100,000+ students K-12 in the states public school system.  
They will all have T-1 speed connections (SMDS) to my site to get to their 
mailboxes.  (obviously I will need a bigger SPARC when they are all online).

Any help would be appreciated.

If you want to do it the "hard" but perfect way, toss Dos + Windows and go for
a Unix operating system. Linux is a good choice; it should run without
problems on your 486 system. You'd get yourself into some trouble by promoting
to system administrator, but being "root" is somehow cool too. The way I'd set
this up is:

    - sendmail as the recepient + delivery agent, also using deliver for local
    users; the uucp thing would be handled inside sendmail

    - regular times to dial out and retrieve mail; sendmail has lots of info
    on how to do this

    - give your 10 doctors local usernames and a telnet connection; if they
    won't do other stuff than read mail they should be quite happy on one
    Linux box.

    - set up Pine as the mail reader.

I may be quite wrong, but I thought that Pine was a _reader_ and not a
_retriever_ of mail..

Subject: zero-length .pine-interrupted-mail files
Date: 10 Jan 1995 17:44:33 GMT
Message-Id: <3euh21$12np@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

I am running Pine 3.91 on a 15,000-user AIX 3.2.5 site.  Among these 
users, the most common problem they experience with Pine (our Help Desk 
says they get this question several times a day) is zero-length 
.pine-interrupted-mail* files in the home directory.

What happens when they get these is this: Pine tells them they have 
postponed mail, and asks if they wish to continue.  When the user answers 
"Yes", it either says "You don't have any interrupted mail!" and goes 
back to the menu/index, or it core dumps with an "abend" error.

As far as I am able to tell, Pine *never* produces a non-zero-length 
pine-interrupted-mail* file.

We had this problem with even greater frequency than is now the case, but 
I was able to allieviate the problem to some degree by recompiling Pine.  
I had originally compiled Pine without "-DDEBUG" because pine-debug files 
were accumulating on our system, and sometimes Pine would go out of 
control and continue to write to a pine-debug file until the filesystem 
was full.

Once I restored "-DDEBUG" (setting the default debug level to 0) the 
.pine-interrupted-mail files were reduced, but they still occur.

Can anyone suggest how we can fix this?  It is extremely annoying to both 
our Help Desk and our users.

Try pine-setup-configure, slow_terminal=on. This will show an arrow 
indicator instead of doing the reverse video bit.

May not be what you want, but it should work for the current message 
line.

If your problem is the reverse video at the top and bottom of the screen 
then you might have to dive into your vt100 termcap on the local machine 
(ugly ;)

My first guess is that you're using Terminal for Windows, and you've 
turned on "Use function, arrow and control keys for Windows".  This 
causes all arrow, F-key control keys which might be trapped as windows 
commands to never be sent to the session.  So, ^C is (C)opy to 
clipboard.  And so forth.

Sound plausible?

If you have two files that are both address books, you can combine them 
into one larger one by concatenating the files.  So you could send an 
address book to somebody else by sending the file (usually .addressbook) 
as an attachment.  Then the receiver would save that into a file and 
"cat" it together with their existing address book or have it be a second 
address book.  No way to send part of an address book without some hand 
editing outside of pine.

A distribution list has the format

nickname <TAB> full_list_name <TAB> (addr1,addr2,...)

Check in your .addressbook for an example.  You just need to be sure to 
use tabs in the appropriate places.  A regular simple entry is

nickname <TAB> fullname <TAB> address

Yes, use ';' to select all the parts, then "a|uudecode" to decode them. 
Note that the parts need to be listed in order in the index before doing
the decoding...

Okay, you've got it Mark....OUTSTANDING!  Nice work...please don't let 
the poo-pooers get you sidetracked.  From one avid Unix Pine and 
Winsock Pine user, the Pine team has done an excellent job with very 
little resources and support.  Too bad those who are quick to b!#ch don't 
take the time to read the canned response, lest they understand, and lack 
the initiative to help themselves a little.

Keep up the good work.

Me too...and I've found what I think is the IDEAL setup with PC-Pine 
Winsock.  It runs with the winsock so I can run my other apps at the same 
time, but Pine is not a full blown Windoze GUI...perfect!  Text based, 
keyboard entry..and just like Unix Pine on my other platform!  I love 
it.  I just hate going back and forth between mouse and kbd all the time 
like you have to with "real" windows pgms.

This is excatly what I do with Pine.  I fooled around with a LOT of 
offline mail readers and none of them can match the capabilities of Pine 
IMO....searching all text in a folder, etc.  When I want to do some 
archive reading offline, I just ^C at the login prompt to bypass the 
server connection, then switch my modem off.  Pine sqwauks a few times 
about not being able to open the inbox, but it runs just fine as an 
offline reader.

When you go to compose your mail, press Ctrl-R in the header area to 
expose rich headers.  The rich header contains a couple extra fields, one 
of which is BCC:, for blind carbon copies.

Pine does not yet support RFC1522 for 8-bit characters in headers.  That

	The current version of pine does not support RFC 1522, which is
MIME in headers RFC.  I believe this is on the "to do" list...but not
sure of the priority.

    I am having a difficult time getting Pine compiled for Solaris 2.4
using gcc 2.6.3.  If anyone that has installed Pine on a sparc Solaris
2.4 box has any hints they'd like to pass along I'd be very grateful.
If there is sufficient interest I'll summarize to this newsgroup.
Thanks in advance for any help.

Mark Crispin justifiably said:
 
 +   We hate having to send the canned message.  But there's no choice; we
 +   have to get some work done, otherwise what with state budget cuts there
 +   might not be a Pine team (not that getting work done is any guarantee
 +   that the axe won't fall -- they are in a sour mood in Olympia, and axing

According to Syd, the Elm Team needs to find an oasis pretty soon, else it
might .... due to excessive heat and no water. We would *hate* to see that
repeat .......esp. to The Pine Team.

Muchos Kudos to you Folks!! Great Job !! Keep up the good work!!

We need better and better versions of Pine. We don't need some salesman
plastic politeness/b.s. I/we get that enough already.

	In order to use the BCC feature, first type ^R while the curser is
in the header of the document you wish tosend.  This invokes the "Rich
Header"  feature.  Then, in the line titled BCC, just place all the names
as you normally would in the TO: line. 

	Whenever I do this I usually place a descriptive name in the TO: 
line, just for effect.  To do this, remember to use quotes if it is more 
than one word.  PINE then adds your domain name at the end.  When you 
send the message your original one will come back to you as 
undeliverable, since it was a dummy, though descriptive address.

					Hope this helps,


					Daniel.

Comes here Mr. Ponnusamy Rajendran with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine"
group in this article on Tue, 10 Jan 1995 05:56:30 GMT:

 +   We have Pine 3.91 running on a SunOS4.1.x system. When expanding 
 +   the News Collection folder I get

 +     [ ** Empty List **  Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]

 +   message.  But when telnet to port 119 (for nntp services) on the 
 +   news server, I can see the news group listing.

You probably are missing a ".newsrc" file which is what Pine looks up for
newsgroup local subscription info. Bascically it is the list of all the
newsgroups that you have subscribed to. Your local NewsAdmin will know.

Comes here Mr. Ray McAllister with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on Tue, 10 Jan 1995 02:24:02 -0500 (EST):

 +   	Question 1, Please help! How can I access or see what is in my "Home 
 +   Directory"? I cannot seem to find it anywhere on either hard drive, to see
 +   what is in it; to use it, or to delete it. Thanks a million.

/u3/mcallist

That is your "home directory"/"Home Directory"
Here's where you will see all the files that belongs to your account.
/u3/mcallist/mail will be the dir. where you will see all your mail folders.

 +   	Question 2, Where or how can I get a manual for Pine?

ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

 +   	Question 3, When I go into rz to bring a pre-existing file into 
 +   my home directory I sometimes end up with the Procom 2 screen telling me 
 +   Port in use, yet I have hung up. How can I get rid of Port in use and 
 +   continue with Procom and pine without closing everything back to C:?

set port port##

Aah! here you seem to know about home directory.
BTW this modem question really doesn't belong to comp.mail.pine or does it?

One clarification: The .newsrc really only needs to include the 
newsgroups to which one is subscribed.  If it is currently empty,
or non-existent, one needs to use the "A Add" command to subscribe.

(We know that this is far from obvious.... sorry.  Also, we know that it 
is a pain to only be able to subscribe to one group at a time.)

See I'm not sure that's gonna work as .addressbook is kinda uniquely formatted.
I haven't tried this but if you have a file which is tab separated in this way

first column: nickname
second column: Full Name
third column: complete e-mail address

and each column separated by a tab and then if you cat that file to .addressbook
it might work. Before you try this make sure you make a backup copy of your
.addressbook and .addressbook.lu files.

In Pine 3.91 which was what you are using, you can import a list of addressess
into a new/existing addressbook list. Great Job, kudos to Pine Team!!

And to your second question just send your .addressbook file to whoever you
want it to be sent. Ofcourse I wouldn't include personal address nicknames in
that case.

The SIZE of each indivual mail in bytes. Number of lines?
If you find out..post it.

Place your cursor at the To: header region and hit Control-R for Rich-Headers.
You will see a Bcc: header, just fill in here the entire list but be told that
there's a limit to how many addressess you can have per header (think itz < 50)

I get the impression that YOU are the one being impolite (no other
words in the tip of my tongue).  If a simple bug report makes you
react that way, you may consider taking a vacation, or getting some
professional help.    

My experience when I reported a bug to cac was very positive.

Happy 1995...

> Is there any detailed documentation available for reading news in Pine?

Last October, I produced a document for the transition from 3.89 to 3.90.
Part of it referred to accessing Usenet News from Pine.  The details are
given below (and are equally applicable to Pine 3.91).  

Note: the text of Section 13 refers to Sections 6 and 12 which are given
later in this message. 

: 13. Accessing Usenet News from Pine
: 
: In previous versions of Pine, you were able to read the newsgroups of
: Usenet News.  In Pine 3.90, there are additional facilities, e.g., you
: can subscribe/unsubscribe to newsgroups and post articles to
: newsgroups.
: 
: In order to access Usenet News, you should go to the Config Screen (see
: Section 6), move the cursor down to the line starting "nntp-server =",
: press A (for Add Text) and then type the address of an nntpserver:
:    newsserver.site.domain 
: Note that it is not necessary to set the news-collections variable.
: Although optional, I believe it is also useful to include both
: compose-sets-newsgroup-without-confirm and expanded-view-of-folders in
: the setting of the feature-list variable.  To do this, move down to
: compose-sets-newsgroup-without-confirm and press X; and then move down
: to expanded-view-of-folders and press X.
: 
: You will now need to leave Pine, and re-start it.  If you then press L
: to get the folder-list you will see a section headed News-collection.
: If you move to this section, you can press A followed by the name of a
: newsgroup in order to subscribe to that newsgroup.  If you are
: uncertain about the name, then follow the A by Ctrl-T in order to list
: the names of all the newsgroups.  If you press W at this point, you
: can find out those newsgroups whose names contain a particular string.
: 
: The information about which newsgroups you are subscribed to is
: written to the file .newsrc.  If you don't want your subscribed
: newsgroups to be displayed in alphabetical order, you may set the
: news-read-in-newsrc-order feature.  To do this, go to the Config Screen
: (see Section 6) and then move the cursor down to the line containing
: news-read-in-newsrc-order and press X.  You also need to edit your
: .newsrc file so that the lines appear in the order that you wish to
: look at the newsgroups.
: 
: Once you have subscribed to the newsgroups which you think you may be
: interested, you can use them just like mail folders.  
: 
: When you have read an article, you can use the D command to record the
: fact that you have already seen it.  This information is also stored
: in the .newsrc file.  In this way, the article will not be presented
: to you the next time you read Usenet News.
: 
: If you already have the folder for a newsgroup open, you can use the C
: command to post an article to the newsgroup.  If you want to follow-up
: an existing article, or you want to reply to the sender of an article,
: use the R command.
: 
: Some newsreaders provide "threading", a facility where all the
: articles of a newsgroup which have the same subject are grouped
: together.  You can arrange for Pine to present the articles of a
: folder index sorted into threads by pressing $ followed by o whilst
: you are in the folder index.  This only has an effect on the folder
: index: it does not actually alter the folder.
: 
: Although Pine does not have a command to "catch up" in a newsgroup
: (that is, to mark all the articles as deleted), you can use Pine's new
: aggregate command set (see Section 12) to do this.  Pressing the four
: keys ;aad will cause all the articles in the current folder to be
: marked as deleted.  So these articles will not be shown the next time
: you enter the newsgroup.

The above text refers to Sections 6 and 12 which are
reproduced below:
 
: 6.  Configuring Pine using the "Config Screen"
: 
: In previous versions of Pine, you had to alter the .pinerc file if you
: wanted to configure Pine.  In Pine 3.90, you can configure Pine by
: going to the Setup Configuration Screen (which is called the "Config
: Screen" in this document).  To find this screen, go to the Main Menu,
: press S followed by C.
: 
: You can use the Config Screen to change the settings of some of Pine's
: variables.  If you are uncertain as to the purpose of a variable (or a
: value), move the cursor so that the appropriate line of the Config
: Screen is highlighted, and press ? (for Help).  Any changes that you
: make to the Config Screen will eventually be written to your .pinerc
: file.  For many changes, the change that you want will be effected
: immediately: however, for other changes you will need to leave Pine
: and then re-start it.
: 
: 12. Using aggregate commands
: 
: The A, Z and ; commands form the "aggregate command set".  The ;
: command allows you to select all the messages that match some
: criteria; the A command allows to apply some command to each of the
: selected messages; and the Z command allows you to zoom in on the
: selected messages by changing the folder index temporarily so that
: only these messages are displayed.  In order to use any of these
: commands, you need to have enable-aggregate-command-set included in
: the setting of the feature-list variable.  To do this, go to the
: Config Screen (see Section 6) and then move the cursor down to the line
: containing enable-aggregate-command-set and press X.
: 
: Here are some more details about the aggregate commands.
: 
: The ; command selects messages in the folder index according to a
: criterion that you choose.  It can be one of the following: (a) all
: messages, (b) a list or a range of message numbers, (c) messages
: containing a particular string within the From, To, Cc or Subject
: lines or within the entire text of the message, (d) the current
: message, (e) messages on/before/since a specified date, (f) messages
: that have a status flag of new/deleted/answered/important.
: 
: Having chosen the criterion, the selected messages are indicated in
: the folder index by a X in the first column (unless the
: show-selected-in-boldface feature has been chosen).  There is another
: way in which you can show which messages have been selected: if you
: issue a Z command after a ; command it will temporarily restrict the
: folder index to the selected messages --- pressing Z again returns you
: to the full folder index.
: 
: If you have already used a ; command (to select a set of messages),
: then, if you type ; command again, Pine will ask you whether you want
: to (i) unselect all the selected messages, (ii) unselect the current
: message, (iii) add more messages to the set of selected messages, (iv)
: remove some messages from the set of selected messages.  If you choose
: (iii) or (iv), then you can indicate the criterion by which messages
: are added to, or removed from, the current selection.  Once again, the
: criterion can be any of those labelled (a) to (f) above.
: 
: Having selected a set of messages, you can use the A command to apply
: any of the following operations to the set of selected messages: save,
: export, print, delete, undelete, reply, forward, takeaddr, flag or
: pipe.

Strange... I had to deal with exactly the same problem only yesterday.  
Traced it eventually to the empty interrupted mail file (Pine was 
aborting with a bug detected).

There's also a weakness in the Bezerk mailbox handling if (for whatever 
reason) the last message in the file has the separating "From blah" line 
but no further lines afterward.  We had a few of these appear when our 
mail delivery system threw a wobbler; Pine just aborts with a bug detected.

On 'Apologies ...', instant response etc I agree - you can *hope* to get 
what you pay for (you shouldn't *expect* to get what you don't pay for,
though you might)
but I also think 
	you could never have got Pine just by paying for it

Many thanks to UoW, because they *have* paid for it - but they've got
more than they paid for.
Many thanks to all the active Pine community, (as well as the Pine team)
who contribute, try things out, supply work-arounds, answer questions ...

Greetings and HELP.  

The PINE folks suggested that I post my questions to the List, so here goes.

I am trying to identify an e-mail program that will serve the 
majority of 2100 people at our facility.  The people in the facility 
currently use MicroSoft Mail (Mac and PC),  PROFS, Unix Mail, Elm, and (a 
few smart ones) PINE.  Our local computer resources include Sun and VAX 
VMS servers, all tied together on a high-speed LAN.  In addition, there 
are a number of individuals who log in locally or remotely via a 
low-speed LAN through a bridge to the high speed LAN and/or to the IBM PROFS 
gateway.

I have been using PINE since discovering it in August.  (I needed a 
program that would handle MIME encoded messages.)  I am very pleased with 
the program, and I am trying to promote it here.

While we would like all users to have a single system address for their 
mail drop, we anticipate that they will want to forward their mail to 
their local Sun server or MS Mail inbox.  We recognize that the Sun 
servers we have bog down with more than 15-20 concurrent logins, so we 
are setting up a pair of VAX systems as a common e-mail server.

1) Does anyone have any information on portability of PINE to VAX VMS? (It
was not listed with successful ports in the August pine-ports file, and
there was no indication whether it had been tried unsuccessfully? 

2) Has anyone tried to incorporate message acknowledgement functionality into
PINE?  That is if a message is sent registered by Pine, a Pine program on
the receiving end would send an registered receipt to the originator when
the message was read.  We have a program on the AT&T that embeds a code of
the form "[R(nnnn)]" in the subject of a registered message.  When the
program receives a message with this code, it sends a registered receipt
under the recipient's login indicating message nnnn was read with the
subject, time, and date.  See below: 

 Receipt Header:  

 From <recipient of registered message>
 To: <sender of registered message>
 Subject: Registered Mail Receipt [A(nnnn)]
 Status: RO
 
 Receipt message:
 
      Your registerd mail message has been reeived and read: 
 
      RECIPIENT:          <recipient of registered message>
      DATE:               <date and time message was read>
      SUBJECT:            <subject of original message>

3) Has anyone tried to incorporate a uuencode recognition/filter into
PINE?  We correspond with users of MicroSoft Mail and CC:MAIL, and would
like to be able to choose between MIME and uuencode on send and to have
PINE recognize both forms on receipt. 

Thanks in advance for any help/info you can provide.

I wanted to do the same thing, but if I'm understanding you correctly, it 
can't be done with blind cc's.

What I think you want to do is send mail to a long list of people, but 
have only that person's name show on the To: line.  As far as I know, 
this can't be done without a mailing robot.

The only thing that's blind about a Bcc: is that the people in the To: 
address can't see the addresses of the people in Bcc:, but the people in 
Bcc: can see everything.

Hello All --

I've just compiled PINE 3.91 under OSF on my DEC Alpha 3300.  

I have a second Alpha 3300, but it does not have the same software setup 
and the first, and I cannot compile PINE on this system;  it bombs out.

When we were running PINE 3.90 I had successfully FTP'd pine over to my 
second Alpha system, and it ran just fine.  (Acutally, I FTP'd pine, 
pico, imapd, and mtest over to the /usr/bin directory)  I just tried to 
FTP PINE 3.91 over to my second Alpha, (in the same directory) and I can't 
get it to run.  The error is   pine: cannot execute

What parts of PINE 3.91 need to be present (and where) in order for it to 
execute?

Thanks

Go up to the header and get "rich header" -- ctrl-r on 3.91.  Send it to 
yourself, and Bcc it to the rest.

One of my (new) user of PC-PINE is complaining at the following.
When calling the editor, Pine (appears) to specify a file name in the 
root directory. This means that if the editor makes backups of files as 
they are being made (eg on a time basis) they pile up in root. In 
addition, should a reboot occur (even when using Pico), broken bits are left 
also in root.

He states, and I think that I agree with him, that the Dos TEMP variable 
should be used (if present) to indicate a suitable temporary directory. 
In some circumstances, Pine uses TMP, but not in this one.

Do others agree that this is a bug?

There are two ports to VMS, one is available as part of the PMDF software
we do (at least some other parts of your company are PMDF customers),
for more information, send mail to sales@innosoft.com ($ related 
questions), or service@innosoft.com (for tech questions).

another is free (ported by yehavi@vms.huji.ac.il),
and available for ftp in the US (see below)

----
Subject: repost: Pine/VMS FTP site in US 

	Since there has been a bit of traffic about it recently, I figured
I'd let people know again that VMS-Pine v3.91 is available for anonymous ftp
from lenin.cc.rochester.edu.  Extracting it requires a recent version of
UNZIP, and you MUST remember to transfer it as a binary.  This version
provides improved TCPIP support, but I've found that 3.89 seems to work
better under my installation of VMS (5.4-2).  (I'm not using TCPIP support,
since I only use it for local mail and I need to talk to PMDF anyway.) BTW: 
Congratulations to the development team; it's a great program.  

	Tom

no, on VMS Pine uses your VMS MAIL files, a read-receipt (or any other 
receipt) is not supported by VMS MAIL. However, if PMDF is used to 
deliver mail to VMS MAIL mailbox, and the sender requested read or 
delivery receipt, then PMDF turns it into a delivery receipt (because it 
has control at that time) and sends an acknowledgement. Personally I 
think read receipt is an invasion of privacy and would never use any 
software which does not offer me a way to turn it off and on at my 
discretion. None of the PMDF Pine users have asked for read receipt 
capability so far.

Pine recognizes BASE64, and if you were getting the mail via PMDF's
Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail support (PMDF-LAN product), it has the
capability of turning their messages format into MIME, and thus the 
result would be recognized by Pine. For example, if I send you a message 
from cc:Mail or Microsoft Mail with an attachment, when you get it in Pine
on VMS or Unix or elsewhere, you will get the attachment BASE64 encoded, 
and would be able to extract it.

Yes.  When in COMPOSE mode, use ^R (Rich Hdr) to bring up a few more
mail sending options.  One such options is Bcc: (blind carbon-copy).

Subject: problem when tmp directory is full
Date: 11 Jan 1995 13:40:38 GMT
Message-Id: <J.S.PEATFIELD.95Jan11134038@kro.amtp.cam.ac.uk>

We have Pine 3.91 running on a variety of machines.  Recently we
noticed that on some of them at least when the tmp directory that pine
stores messages in when sending to sendmail gets full the messages get
lost and the user isn't warned.

We can't test all the machines at this time as e.g. all our Suns use
tmpfs so filling tmp would be a problem for other reasons, but at
least on SGIs this appears to be repeatable just by filling up
/usr/tmp.

Looking at the code in osdep/sendmail it looks like an error from
pine_rfc822_output() will result in a warning for the user:

>   q_status_message2(1, 2, 4, "\007Error \"%s\" writing \"%s\"",
>                          error_description(save_errno), pretty_fn(filename));

but I see no such message.  Looking deaper into pine_rfc822_output() I
can see that the error chain looks ok 'til I get lost inside
pine_rfc822_output_body() where I can't tell what is happening.

Does anyone else see this or is it a symptom of a problem with our
setup?

Does someone who understands the pine source better than me know what
is going on here?

Then if the recpients wish to reply, will they get the message

   	I've been using perl scripts for PGP mail in elm for a while, and I've
   been told by a friend of mine that pine has PGP support built it.  Is this
   true?  

Not yet.

           If not, what mechanism is used to achieve the encryption and decryption?
   Also, where can I find it ... thanks for any help!
   
mkpgp is a c-shell script which serves as a liaison for the Pine 
mailer/newsreader and pgp.

It features: external editor of your choice, external spell checker of
your choice, encryption (with or without signing), signing (with or
without encryption), encrypted attachments selected via browser,
effortless public key additions from e-mail, decryption & signature
verification, effortless encrypted attachment extraction, quote 
characters of your choice, and more... 

To get mkpgp, send blank e-mail to slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with
	Subject: mkpgp
A signed, ascii-armored message should show up in you mailbox within the 
hour.

Process the message with "pgp -p" to produce mkpgp.txt.uu.  mkpgp.txt.uu 
contains the readme atop a uuencode of mkpgp.

(You can add my keys with
        finger deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu | pgp -fka +force 
before you process the message if you want to check the signature.)

To receive updates, send blank e-mail to slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with

mkpgp will show up each time the modification date changes.

Much as I hate following up to my own items here is some more info.

After discovering the TMPDIR variable, I filled up a filesystem and
pointed TMPDIR at it from a Sun4 (sos4) and got the same behavour as
on the SGI.

The relevant bit of the debug log (-d99) is:

The directory /home/fenris/jp107/ had no space left yet I got no error
and the message wasn't sent.  (In fact sendmail sent a null message
which then bounced to postmaster but this isn't helpful.)

Does this give any clues as to the problem?

Any such limit is coming from your mail transport (e.g. sendmail), not
from Pine.  Pine does not impose any limits on numbers of addresses...

	Well, I've built pine now, and got a nice pgp system going with it
(which works well with elm, as well, btw).  The only problem is reading
encrypted messages.  I don't like that you have to reply to them to decrypt and
read them.  In elm, I have a script which will test to see if input is
encrypted, and decrypt it prior to viewing if it is.  I'd like to fully switch
to pine, but the lack of support for external pagers is the only thing holding
me back.  Does anyone know of a hack anywhere that adds this support?
Otherwise it's off to the pine source code with an axe I go...  :-)  Thanks in
advance!

As I understand it, in order to not let recipients of carbon copies 
*know* that they are recipients of carbon copies, you have to hit ctrl-r 
while in compose mode, thus enabling the "rich header", which includes 
the "BCC:" option, for "Blind Carbon Copy."  Let me know how lists work 
in the address book. I haven't figured it out.

There is no environment variable per-se, but there is a command line
option, -P, that specifies an alternate pine.conf file.

>From the next release of the Pine FAQ (coming very soon):

Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this 
feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

I don't know of any current books dedicated to Pine, but several do have 
chapters on it.  Also, check out the documentation available at

  Hi to all,
   I've been trying to get ahold of this program called pine.  I got my 
first Internet file and I needed this program Pine to uncode it.    I 
wrote to pine@cac.washington.edu and they sent me the discription of what 
the program is.  Can I get this from someone?
     
                                                                          
     Thanks to all,

	You can get source code and binaries for certain platforms from
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  

	Without knowing the specific environment that you are running....it
is not very easy to make suggestions.  Not being familiar with prodigy, I
don't know if you have ftp access.  Also, I don't know how you access your
email.

You can ftp Pine from cac.washington.edu, where you will find the source 
code as well as precompiled binaries suitable for several platforms.
 
However, your statement "I got my first Internet file and I needed this
program Pine to uncode it" has me puzzled.  Pine is a mail reader.  What 
kind of file do you expect to "uncode" with it?

[follow-ups set to comp.mail.pine -- I'm sure those folks will correct
the following comments if they're not right...]

I think this will not work.  IMAP has a number of fundamental
differences from POP.  You should run an IMAP server if you want to run
Pine.  Otherwise you need a real POP mail client.  I don't believe there
is any configuration option in pine to change the service or port number
it connects to -- it's set to 143/tcp (IMAP).  pop3 wants 110/tcp.  I don't
think you can change that outside of the source code, and I also don't
think it would work even if you did.

According to the pine manual, the c-client library doesn't do POP:

   Currently  it  understands  Berkeley  mail
   files, Tenex mail files, the IMAP2bis protocol, and NetNews.

>My problem arises in that I do not know how to specify a user name or a

In pine 3.91, this is handled in the online configuration process.
For earlier versions, you edit .pinerc's "inbox path" according to
the comments in the .pinerc file:

  # Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
  # Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).
  inbox-path=

Note that it will assume your remote user name is the same as your 
local user name, but you can override that when it connects (it will
prompt with a default of the local user name).

Subject: 3 questions ? ? ? Mail, Unix, Internet.
Message-Id: <D29rpH.Gwo@freenet.carleton.ca>
Date: Thu, 12 Jan 1995 01:48:52 GMT

I am posting this in the hope somewhere out there [over the rainbow ;) ]
somebody will be able these three questions. I'm a Unix newbie (being very
familiar with less tasking [get it?] systems like Windoze, OS/2, WinNT,
etc. So here are the questions:

1. (a) How do I change my environment to enable Pico to replace the vi editor,
for my own personal use, on the Aix system we have at school. I know Pico
well, and have grown accoustomed to it. Vi is fine, but, to me more of a
pain in the butt to use. I'm auto-launched into a Korn shell at login, but
can change at will. Any suggestions?  (b) How do I edit (and where do I
find) my .tinrc file to enable Pico as my editor for Usenet read/reply?

2. (a) How may I retrieve posts to Usenet groups that my Freenet/University
accounts do not subscribe to? There must be some way of doing an FTP
equivalent to a site that collects the postings. (b) Is there a way of uucp
retrieving them from sites? (c) If so, is it then possible to e-mail a group
directly from the Pine mailer...what would be put into the To:  address
section? (d) Why is the location of usenet-news servers appear to be
so secret and inaccessible to the regular FTP public? Reason: there are some
alt.fan.* groups that we would like to pick up to do some research on
media influence.

3. Our recalcitrant sysadmins won't respond to e-mail, so what are you
normally do with a student aix account? I'm trying to teach myself a bit
of Unix (am going to decide between Free/386/NetBsd, Linux or
Solaris [apparently have a $100 educational deal] versions), so will want
to eventually know the answers to these questions anyway.

Please Reply Via E-Mail

Some of you may notice that I had previously asked one of these questions,
and I thank those who kindly responded, but lost the info on my HD at home
(a friend was playing with the computer and DoD deleted the contents of a
whole directory with PC Tools Pro V.9). 

Thanks to all of you who will help increase knowledge....

Hello there!  Right about now you're probably wondering just what it is
you've gone and downloaded.  Well, first off, I'll be honest with you...
if you're not a SysOp, it's more than likely just something to upload
to various BBSes for the credit.  But, if you're a SysOp then you have
heard all the rage about the Internet that's come up recently.  I'll bet
you even considered looking into getting full access Internet for your
own system!  Well, more than likely you eventually realized that full
access Internet was way too expensive for your BBS to support.... Until
now.

Log On America is now offering full access internet for any BBS in the
nation for the amazingly low price of $24.95 per month.  That's right,
this is no joke...  All you need is a BBS and at least 2 modems... It's
simple, you merely set up the transport door (included as CST54.ZIP) to
run from your BBS software.  Once you contact us, we will give you the
LOCAL phone number that you will need and set up your account.

Here's how it works.  Your users call your BBS as normal, when they run
the Cyberspace Transporter door, it will have your user wait while it dials
Log On America.  Your user will then get full access to Telnet, FTP, Finger,
Whois, World Wide Web.  Using the Telnet client, your users can access IRC,
MUDs, schools, libraries, and more!  With FTP, millions of files from all
over the world become available!  Easy-to-use hypertext interfaces make
surfing the Internet simple with Gopher and the World Wide Web!  You can
find out information about both people and systems with the Finger and
Whois clients!  For as much time as you care to allow them... Then, when
the user types EXIT, the software will drop carrier and return control to
your BBS -- without the user EVER SEEING Log On America.  It's that easy!

For more information or to sign up, you can contact us by any of the
following:

 Phone: (401)453-6100  M-F 9a-5p EST
   Fax: (401)459-6222
   BBS: (401)459-6200

If you access News via NNTP, the .newsrc will be on the client, if you
access it via IMAP, it will be on the server.  This is independent of
whether the client is a PC or Unix user.

Subject: disabling ^Z
Date: 11 Jan 1995 22:09:23 GMT
Message-Id: <STERN.95Jan11140923@nooksack.amath.washington.edu>

I have a problem frequently while using Pine in X-windows.  I usually
have a Pine window startup up using

        xterm -geometry -n PINE -sb -sl 250 -e /usr/local/bin/pine &

Quite often I hit ^Z instead of ^X, so everything gets screwed up, and even
after doing

        fg <Return>

(blindly), I don't get full screen access anymore.  I have to quit
out of Pine, *blindly*, by hitting ^X <Ret> y <Ret>.

So I'm wondering whether there is either

1)  A way to disable ^Z inside Pine, or

2)  A way to make sure ^Z inside an "xterm -e" process doesn't lose screen
access.


Possibility for (1):

make ^Z bring up the option

        Suspend Pine? [y]

in Unix, or

        Start a DOS process? [y]

in DOS, with a configuration option that could disable ^Z completely.
But option (2) would probably be best and quickest :).

E-mail replies preferred,

My best guess is that the list processing software is corrupting or
stripping off the MIME headers as it passes through.  The long term
solution os to get the list manager to fix or repair the list management
software.  In the interim, about all you can do is save the message and
manually reconstruct the mime-version and content-type headers.  They
should be: 

	Mime-Version: 1.0
	Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="0-1982785689-789276093:#6308"

I have 2 enhancement suggestions for easier use of Pine
(they will actually save the user a lot of time):

1. when using Pine as a newsreader for internet newsgroups,
   and I am done with a particular newsgroup, pressing "L"
   returns me to the screen which shows:

       [ Select Here To See Expanded List ]

   It would be nice, and would save time, to be placed back
   into the last expanded list. Otherwise I have to press
   <CR> and wait for the expanded list of newsgroups to be
   generated again.

   When I am in normal (local) email folders and I press "L",
   I am returned to the screen which show my list of folders.
   The newsgroup (remote) list should work the same.

2. Is there a way to show the number of messages on a particular
   newsgroup list from the "Expanded List" screen so that I get
   a visual notification of which newsgroups have messages
   without having to Select the newsgroup?

Thanks.

The format of a simple entry in the addressbook is

	nickname<TAB>full name<TAB>address

The format of a distribution list is

	nickname<TAB>list name<TAB>(address,address,...address)

Just convert your list into that form and Pine can read it as an 
addressbook.  Go to the Setup/Config screen and Add it to the 
address-book entry.

Pine does not have any special provisions for firewalls, but then Pine
typically would not be dealing with a firewall directly.  If you are
trying to access a remote folder across a firewall via IMAP there might
be a problem, but I don't know what the issues are there...

	Are you using pine 3.9x?

	Have you looked in the Configuration menus?

	Have you found:

         [X]  enable-suspend          ???

	Is it enabled, as above?  Try disabling it?

	Good Luck....

I have also wondered about this behaviour.
I think it is a bug.

You can add a Reply-To header in the customized-hdrs entry of the 
Setup/Config screen.  Alternatively, there is a compile-time option that 
allows you to alter the From: header.

This sounds like something your local mail transfer agent is imposing,
and would probably also prevent altering the From: header...

Pine 3.91 fixes at least part of the causes for this looping...

Using pine 3.91 on our Sun Sparc's (SunOS4.1.3) an error message flashes 
only a very short moment, when the file system is full (not only the tmp-area).
Therefore it's sometimes a game of luck if you take notice of it or not.
I'd like pine to double-beep and to wait until I took notice on the error/
warning which occured (typing a key to continue). 
The pine team may consider it as a suggestion for the next release.

if you're talking in terms of sending/receiving mail using Pine, then
it really depends on which delivery agent you're using.  Sendmail is
intelligent enough to work its way around firewalls (as this message proves,
as Digital uses a firewall to isolate its network!)

I just tried to place a distribution list inside my address book
and it looks like the syntax is not quite right. What I found is
that:

   nickname<TAB>list-name<TAB>(address,address,...,address)

must be:

   nickname<TAB>list-name<TAB>"(address,adrress,...,address)"

The quotes are very important.

Sorry to see someone other then me is also having printing problems in 
Pine and not getting any answers from the Group.  I know they are very 
busy, but being a Newby also, we are anxious to get on with our work.  I 
posted about a week ago, have read all the FAQs and just can't solve the 
problem.  I think in my case that the System Operator may have an option 
available that doesn't make printing possible.  Have sent a msg to the 
Sys Op, but to no avail.  In my case, when I ask for the printer, it 
actully captures the article and writes it to my hard disk, and of course 
I can then print from there.  You may check your hard disk and see if 
there is a file name "CAPFILE" or something near that.  Maybe someone out 
there will answer us soon.

Message-Id: <3f3lvl$685@hobbes.cc.uga.edu>

When Pine is displaying the text of incoming mail in its default state 
of "full headers OFF", it shows the standard headers like "From:", "To:",
"Date:", "Subject:", etc.  Is there a way to customize this so that other
specific headers can be displayed without turning on full headers?

Thanks for any help.

     I have had printer problems also and can't seem to get a response.  
I think everyone must be extremely busy.  I posted a question about a 
week ago and still no response.  I discovered that when I wanted to 
print, that the article was being "captured" and sent to the hard disk.  
I can then of course print the file from the hard disk, it is just a 
major annoyance.  I suspect that the System Operators may have the option 
of not making printing available to the system users.  I have sent a query 
to the Sys Op, but no response from there either.  I, too, am a Newby so 
it is frustrating to try to learn and to be able to find help.  check 
your hard disk and see if you have a file named "CAPFILE".  If so, you can 
print out your article from there.  Hope this was some help.

This is indeed a bug, and it will be fixed in the 3.92 release.  Thanks!

This is undocumented *and* unsupported *and* there is no guarantee of it
being there in the future, but {host/pop3}INBOX works as a mailbox
specifier in Pine.  Only INBOX is permitted, due to limitations of POP3.

I hope you are patient, because Pine will generate a lot more network 
traffic if it has to use POP3 than it would if it used IMAP.  Also, you 
can forget about flags (seen, deleted, etc) sticking in the mailbox 
between sessions.

Bottom line: it's better to use IMAP.

Presently, I use TCP/Connect II to grab my mail off the pop server here at 
school.

Sometimes, I can't do this...because I am in the lab or at a friends computer.  
So, I want to be able to log onto the pop sever, like my mail client in TCP/
Connect II does, except I want to do it in my UNIX account.

>From here, I would like to either view the mail in pine, or have them 
downloaded to text files for reading...

Is there any kind of software for this available for UNIX?

Thanks.

Please reply through E-Mail, I don't really read these newsgroups very much.  
Sorry for the cross-posting.

Is there any reason why you didn't include bounce in Apply?...

sometimes I bounce several messages from a mail-list to a friend, and for 
her it's better to receive them as individual pieces of mail than as 
attachements...

or did I miss something?

BTW.... thanks for pine... I do help a lot of people to deal with their 
mail... and pine, by far, is the easiest to learn and use...

I have installed PINE 3.91 on a my PC. Sometimes it is possible to start PINE 
but mostly it stops after input of my passwd.
The error message is "Pine Caused a General Protection Fault in the module 
PINE.EXE at 0008:B600.
The same error exist when I start to config PINE from PIne]

Is there a solution for this problem?

You folks aren't alone.  I have trouble with printing also and can't seem
to find any help.  Using Procomm, both at home on my Tandy and at
school on my IBM with Epson 870 printer, it completely locks up
if I try to print.  I have to totally re-boot to unlock it.

Using Telix I have a little better luck.  I can print as long as the
message is not too long.  If it is more than two sheets worth of paper,
it gives me an abort message.

Pine uses MIME for all attachments and BASE64 encodes all attachments.  A
good cc:Mail<->Internet gateway should be able to translate between MIME
and cc:Mail attachments, but unfortunately many do not...

You may be able to get the file through by uuencoding it and including
the uuencoded text into the body of a message using ^R.

Dear reader!

If and when I need to edit an incoming file/letter/text in order to save 
it in a - for me - more convenient way - I'm in trouble! How do I delete 
lines or blocs which to me are uninteresting? 
Thanks for your help!

Is there any documents that explain *step-by-step* how to install Pine?
I have read the FAQ and all the other documents in the Pine FTP archive.

I am at the beginner level with UNIX and, for better or worse, I have
been made the mail administrator of our Sun SPARC station.  I managed to
configure sendmail to work and now our users want something more user
friendly in a  mail system.  Any pointers on where to find an
installation document is greatly appreciated.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split a digested article by typing G%
  while viewing it.  This will present each digest item on a submenu.  You
  can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key and
  g key pressed simultaneously) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                             In order to...
-------                             --------------
|                                   Pipe
a                                   Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/Folders/faq.split  Split the digest into individual
                                    messages and put them in a file named
                                    ~/Folders/faq.split.  (Replace ~/Folders
                                    with your folder directory.)
pine -if ~/Folders/faq.split        Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

For more information see the formail(1) and procmail(1) man pages.

Subject: 1.0 Automatic Signature - Basic Unix Instructions

Q: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my news articles
   and mail messages?

A: The answer depends on your newsreader and mailer but the following
   procedure works for many Unix newsreaders and mailers.


Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Change to your home directory (i.e., $HOME or ~)

pico .signature         Use the pico editor to create a .signature file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your signature>        Note that most systems require your sig to be <= 4
                        lines.  And it's good netiquette to make it as
                        short as possible.

<save and exit>         In Pico use ^x to exit and answer y when asked
                        if you want to save your changes.

chmod 644 .signature    Make .signature readable by all.

ls -l .signature        Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                        drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.

For many newsreaders and mailers this is all you need to do to set up your
signature.  For example the default behaviour of tin(1) and the rn family of 
tools - rn(1), trn(1), strn(1), & Pnews(1) - is to automatically append 
 ~/.signature, if it exists.  If you use Pine, Elm, Mail, Emacs Mail Mode, MH, 
NN, or GNUS follow the additional instructions described below.

After you've set everything up use your mailer to mail a test message
to yourself, and your newsreader and/or news poster (such as nnpost or Pnews)
to post an article to a test newsgroup (use a local newsgroup and Distribution
set to ``local'' to save bandwidth).  Note that with many newsreaders and 
mailers you will not see your signature while you are composing a message - 
it will be automaticlally appended when you send the message.  Note also that 
many systems add a line that contains ``-- '' to the top of your sig.  This is 
used by programs that automatically deal with mail or news to identify the 
start of the signature.

If you have a problem with your sig see section 1.9 on Troubleshooting.

Subject: ... 1.1 Pine 3.90 and Above
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

The default for Pine 3.90 and above is to automatically append .signature (if 
it exists) to your messages.  Many people like to set the signature-at-bottom 
variable which will put your signature below both your message and the message 
you are replying to (if you've included it).  Note that if you are forwarding 
a message your signature will be put below the message that you write but 
above the forwarded message.

To change Pine's signature features:

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the signature-at-bottom feature:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the signature-at-bottom variable
   b) Type x to set/unset this variable.
4. To change the name of your signature file:
   a) Arrow down to the signature-file line
   b) Type c for Change Value
   c) Type the path and name of the file you want to use for your
      signature.  Note that ~ can be used for your $HOME directory.

Subject: ... 1.2 Pine 3.89 and Below
Followup-To: comp.mail.pine

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of
Pine 3.89 often want to edit their ~/.pinerc file so that it contains
the following:

feature-list=signature-at-bottom

If you want more than one feature in your feature-list then they need to
be comma separated like this:

feature-list=old-growth,
	signature-at-bottom

Note that Pine's default is to use ~/.signature for your signature so you
only need to edit the following line if you are using a different file.

signature-file=

Subject: ... 1.3 Elm
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of Elm
should edit their ~/.elm/elmrc file so that it contains the following:

signature = ~/.signature
sigdashes = ON

Remember to delete any # characters before any variables you want
to set.  The defaults are indicated in comment lines starting with ###.

Note that if you want to have a different signature for local mail
(i.e., addresses that don't contain a ! or @) then you can use the
localsignature and remotesignature variables instead of the signature
variable (which specifies one sig for all mail).

Subject: ... 1.4 Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.misc

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Regular Unix "Mail" and "mail" don't have an automatic
signature mechanism.  Many people who normally use a more deluxe
mail utility occasionally find themselves resorting to using one
of these, in which case all you need to know is this command:

	~r $HOME/.signature

This simply tells Mail to include the text of the your signature
file.

=o= If you use Mail on a regular basis you may want to use the
semi-automatic signature feature.  When you're done typing your
message, you append a signature with this command:

	~a

=o= In order for this to work, though, you need to set the
"sign" mail variable.  There are two ways to implement this
variable.  The first is to set it in a $HOME/.mailrc file with
a command like this:

	set sign="Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

If your signature is more than one line long, you can use the
C language string syntax, as in these examples:

	set sign="Jym Dyer\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

			-or-

	set sign="Jym Dyer\
	\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

=o= The disadvantage of doing this in your .mailrc file is
that you now have to maintain the text of your signature in
two places.  Another approach that avoids this problem is to set
"sign" as an environment variable in your shell startup script.
For a Bourne-compatible shell, this is done with this command:

	sign="`cat $HOME/.signature`" export sign

For a C-shell, do this:

	setenv sign "`cat $HOME/.signature`"

Subject: ... 1.5 Emacs Mail Mode

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= Emacs Mail Mode is usually invoked with the "mail" or
"mail-other-window" commands (bound, respectively, to the
"C-x m" and "C-x 4 m" keys by default).  It is also invoked
from various Emacs mail and news packages.

=o= Mail Mode provides a "mail-signature" command to append
the contents of your signature file to the end of your mail
message.  This command is bound to "C-c C-w" by default,
so to insert the signature before mailing, simply type
"C-c "C-w".

=o= If you'd prefer to have your signature automatically
appended to the end of your mail message, the "mail-signature"
command can be put into your "mail-setup-hook" variable in
your $HOME/.emacs file, as in this example:

    (setq mail-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
	 (mail-signature) )))

This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.

Subject: ... 1.6 MH and Emacs MH-E
Followup-To: comp.mail.mh

By Jym Dyer, 1 April 1994

=o= MH doesn't have an automatic signature mechanism, but it
is so configurable that there are a number of different ways
to implement one.  Check the periodic "MH Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) with Answers" posting for details.

=o= CAVEAT:  If you use the environment variable SIGNATURE to
point to your signature file, MH will use it not as a signature,
but as your "fullname".  Even worse, if your version of MH was
built with the "UCI" option and you *don't* use the environment
variable SIGNATURE to point to another file, MH will use the
$HOME/.signature file for this purpose!  To see if your version
of MH has this behavior, enter this command:

  % send -help

And look for the string "[UCI]" in the output.

=o= There's an Emacs interface to MH, called MH-E.  It has its
own signature mechanism, which is invoked with the "mh-insert-
signature" command (bound to the "C-c C-s" keys by default).

=o= This will insert the file $HOME/.signature file by default.
If your signature file has another name (e.g., to avoid its
being used by an MH build with the "UCI" option), you can set
the "mh-signature-file-name" variable to refer to a different
file.

Followup-To: news.software.nn

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of NN
should edit their ~/.nn/init file so that it contains the following:

set query-signature off
set append-signature-mail on
set append-signature-post offf

Note that the reason that you need to ``set append-signature-post off'' is
that the news posting software (usually inews) automatically appends
 ~/.signature if it exists.  If you ``set append-signature-post on'' then
both nn and inews append your sig and you'll send out two identical sigs
every time.

Copyright (c) 1994 Mike Northam

In addition to the basic signature instructions in 1.0 above, users of GNUS
should verify that the value of the variable gnus-signature-file points to the
right place.  If you're in emacs, you can do so by evaluating the following
expression:
gnus-signature-file
                   ^ put your cursor here and type C-x C-e

you should see "~/.signature" in the echo area.  If not, edit your
$HOME/.emacs file and add the following:
(setq gnus-signature-file "~/.signature"))
Then load your $HOME/.emacs file or merely restart emacs and the variable
should be set correctly.

Subject: ... 1.9 Troubleshooting Signature Problems

A common problem people have with .signature (and .plan, .project, and
 .forward ) files is that the permissions are not set correctly.  Check
to make sure that you have set the permissions as instructed in 1.0 above.

If you are still having problems read the man pages for your newsreader,
news poster, or mailer and search for the string "signature".  There may be a
variable you need to set in order for the ~/.signature to be appended.

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
man CommandName |less   Open man pages for CommandName (elm, pine, nn, tin
                        trn, Pnews, etc.) and pipe through less.  If your
                        system doesn't have less replace it with "more".

/signature              Search for first occurrence of "signature".

n                       Search for next occurrence of "signature".
                        Repeat the search until you find the appropriate
                        section of the manual.

u                       Page up half a screen. (This works in less but not in
                        more.)

[spacebar]              Page down a screen. (This works in both less and more.)


For more information on reading manual pages see the man(1), less(1), and/or
more(1) man pages.

Subject: 2.0 Finger - Basic Unix Instructions

People around the world can find out more about you by fingering you.  
This is done by typing the following at a Unix prompt:

   finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

On some systems finger is linked to f so the following also works:

   f YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name


Finger displays different information on different systems.  Often it will 
display your full name, your default shell, when your were last logged on, 
and your ~/.plan and ~/.project files.

If you finger someone and the display takes more than one page you can pipe 
the output through less (or more if you don't have less).  For example to 
find out about Halcyon, my Internet service provider, type:

  finger info@halcyon.com |less

Subject: ... 2.1 URLs for Fingering

In addition to using the finger or f command you can finger people
through a Web browser.  The following is a form that Doug Stevenson
<doug+@osu.edu> created:
  http://www.mps.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/finger.pl

You can also use this URL:
  gopher://fully.qualified.domain.name:79/0userid
                                          ^ Note: 0 precedes the userid

For example you can finger my Internet service provider with this URL:
  gopher://halcyon.com:79/0info

On many Unix systems you can change some of your default information,
such as your full name, by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

   chfn

If chfn is not available try "passwd -f".  If neither of these are
available then you will need to contact your system administrator and
ask him/her to change your full name, etc.

After you have changed your information check that they are in place
by fingering yourself.  Also to see a different display of your
information type the following at your Unix prompt:

  finger

This displays a one line description of everyone currently logged on
your system.

For more information see the chfn(1), passwd(1), and finger(1) man pages.

Subject: ... 2.3 Adding More to Your Finger Info: .plan & .project

Your ~/.project and ~/.plan files, if they exist, are displayed when you
are fingered.  Setting these up is essentially the same as setting
up a ~/.signature file (described in 1.0 above).

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Change to your home directory.

pico .plan              Use the pico editor to create a .plan file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

chmod 644 .plan         Make .plan readable by all.

ls -l .plan             Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x.
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each.

ls -la .                Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.


If you want a .project file follow the same procedure.  Note that only the
first line of the .project is displayed (so you might as well only make
it one line!).

To test your changes finger yourself by type each of the following at your
Unix prompt:

    finger YourUserID
    finger YourUserID@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

To ensure that people from other systems can finger you should ask someone 
who's not on your system to finger you too.

Subject: ... 2.4 Finding Out Who Fingers You

This is complicated - and sometimes impossible - to setup.  For details see
the news.answers article ``Unix - Frequently Asked Questions (4/7) [Frequent
posting]'', subject ``4.9) How do I keep track of people who are fingering 
me?'' This article is archived in a number of places including these two URLs:

ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/faq/part4

One easy thing that you can do to see if anyone has fingered you is type the 
following at your Unix prompt:

  ls -lu $HOME/.plan

This tells you the last time someone accessed your .plan, but it doesn't
tell you who it was.  I have this in my .login because it's interesting to
see when the last time someone was checking on me!

[Note that under AFS (Andrew File System, a distributed filesystem),
 ls -lu $HOME/.plan will not work due to the fact that AFS has no 
 notion of ``atime'', or ``last accessed time''.]

Subject: ... 2.5 Backfinger Script

Copyright (c) 1994 Janet Rosenbaum

There is a script available called, among other things, backfinger,
planner, and finger_logger (flogger or frogger, for short).  This script
makes your plan into a named pipe (just think of this as a sort of
pipe used with plumbing that opens out onto the screen of the person who
is fingering you (fred)) so that when it is accessed, it looks for a
program from which to get something to stick on fred's screen.

The script is called when you are fingered.  At that moment, it looks to
the finger port of your unix machine and sees which machine fred is
on, logs that machine's IP number and hostname, and the date.  The script
can then execute a command to spit a plan out on fred's screen.  (One
might get creative and write a program that generates random poetry or
use the fortune program or just do "cat plan_file".)   To make fred
think you are really cool, it also tells him what machine he is
fingering you from.

Some caveats:

	-- This program must be running at all times on your system even
	when you are logged out.  Leaving a background process like this
	annoys most sys admins to no end, especially on systems with
	high load.  Do **not** run the program unless you are sure that
	you are allowed to run background processes like this.

	-- Also, if you decide you want to stop running this program,
	remove your .plan file as soon as you kill the process.  If you
	do not do this, all finger processes for you will hang.

	-- This script only tells you the machine fred is fingering you
	from, not his actual username.  It is nearly impossible to get
	this information except at sites with bad security.


Given the above, I will distribute the script to those who can use it,
mostly for educational reasons.  I admit that I no longer run the
program, since my two main accounts are on rather high-load systems.
Nevertheless, I learned quite a lot from modifying these scripts and
otherwise playing with these ideas.

Here is the web site:

 http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~jrosen/scripts/logger.src

I will also try to post this answer and the program to comp.sources.misc
at least monthly for those without web access.  (For those who have not
figured out the web, try the program lynx if you are on a vt100 or vt220
type terminal.  If you are on an xterm or hpterm, look for xmosaic.)

Note:  I am not the author of this program.  The version I distribute is
virtually identical to that distributed by Steve Franklin.
Here are the real authors:

It is considered good netiquette to keep your signature to four lines or
less.  And many news posters, like inews, will not post an article
that has a signature with more than four lines in it.  So, put large
pictures, your life story, etc. in your finger files or in your Web pages
and point people to them in your signature.

A good source of art for your signature and finger files is the ascii art
FAQ which contains (among others) these topics:
   9  Where can I find ASCII art?
  22  How do I put an animation in my plan?
  23  How do I make a sig?
  24  How do I have my sig automatically added to my posts and email?

The Ascii Art FAQ can be found at either of the following.  (I think
these aren't the same so you might want to look at both of them.)

In the csh or tcsh you can set this variable in your ~/.login with a line like 
this:

  setenv ORGANIZATION "Your Organization Name"

After you edit your ~/.login you can establish the setting by either logging
out and loggin back in or by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

I guess I'm just feeling impatient because I've asked this question

missed it.

So, I will ask the question again.  What exactly are the numbers in
brackets next to the sender supposed to represent?  I am guess at
number of characters or something like that.  That is basically
useless to me, compared to knowing how many lines long the e-mail is.
Is there a way to get this?  I went through the .pinerc, and didn't
see anything that was related to it.  Did I plain miss it?

Thanks

	Yes, you missed something.  It is call the "help" screen.

	Do the following:

1.	Start pine.

2.	Type i (for index).

3.	Type ? (for help).

4.	Read until you find....

	Description of the FOLDER INDEX Screen

5.	Continue reading until you find.

You are correct that the count is number of characters/bytes in the
message.  There is not currently an option to display the number of
lines...

I am trying to attach a file to a message in Pine to be sent to a cc:Mail 
network. I sent a Binary attachment but it did not seem to make it. Could 
this be because his network does not support MIME or because the way pine 
attaches files is different then cc:mail? If it is because they don't 
supprt MIME would an ASCII file attachment make it down or does pine 
automatically MIME encrypt all attachments?

Any help is GREATLY appreciated (this is an important file) could you 
please reply via e-mail though to jdeaver@u.washington.edu

Thank You.

In case you haven't used uuencode, this is how I do it:

  uuencode <source file> <source file> > <temp.file>
e.g., uuencode my_file.doc my_file.doc > temp.uu

The first "my_file.doc" tells uuencode what file to process.
The second "my_file.doc" gets stored in the header of the uuencoded file 
and will be the name of the file when uudecoded by the recipient.
File temp.uu is where I temporarily store the uuencoded data.
Then use ^R in the body of the message to read temp.uu into the message.

Your recipient needs to run "uudecode <filename>", where <filename> is 
the name of the file he store your encoded message in.  

Note on uuencode/uudecode, only put one uuencoded message in a file, 
uudecode is not smart enough to close the first and open the next, etc.

Frank,

	One thing I omitted.....

	For one message you can do the following while viewing the message:

1.	Type | (pipe).

2.	Type wc -l 

	This will return the line count to you....

Does cc:mail include a uudecoding function standard? I tried just reading 
the ascii version of the file into the body but it reformatted the text 
and made it worthless.

Hello all,

we use pine-3.91, elm, mail on a variety of UNIX-hosts.

We found that the locking mechanisms used by pine are somewhat different
(more intelligent) than those of other agents.

Could someone please describe in detail the locking that pine uses
for read/write if one user starts several pine sessions. Is the locking
different if imap is used? Is it possible that a (older) pine process can
get back the lock from a newer one under certain circumstances?

The reason for this question is a strange situation that we experienced
on our convex. Sometimes a user can not open his INBOX. When invoking
any user agent this process is hung.
The workaround is to make a copy of /usr/spool/mail/LOGINID and replace the 
"locked" one with the copy.
THe conclusion is that there is a problem with INBOX file logging.

Thanks for any hints and help

Since installing Pine 3.90 on ICL DRS6000 running SVR4 
we are running very short of memory. 
It's a great programbut how much memory would Pine be expected
to require per user for simple text messages.
Is there any way of reducing it from just over 2 meg per user 
which it seems to need now.

We have a large number of Unix machines of different architectures
networked together automounting a number of filesystems from different
servers using NFS.  In particular, the directory /usr/spool/mail can be
NFS-automounted by most of the machines. 

We occasionally find a locking problem with elm and pine, and the standard
solution I use to solve the problem is the one you describe above:

   cd /usr/spool/mail
   touch FOLDER.lock
   mv FOLDER FOLDER-
   cp -p FOLDER- FOLDER
   rm FOLDER.lock 
   rm FOLDER-

If you then do a "ls -a", you find that the FOLDER- file still exists 
but under the name .nfsXXX where each X is a digit.

It seems that some process somewhere has the file open, and the call of
fcntrl by elm/pine hangs.  The problem occurs here about once a month for
elm and very seldom for pine.  The only time it has occurred for pine was
when we had major problems one day, and many machines were rebooted.  With
elm the problem occurs with the person's inbox, whereas with pine the
problem occurred with folders in the person's mail subdirectory (because
these are NFS-mounted whereas with Pine we use IMAP for the inbox). 

Technically I don't know much about this subject, and so please excuse 
any errors.

I am using PC-Pine&PC-NFS.
I have no problems reading/sending mail.
My problem is setting up Pine to read news.

In my pinerc i have:
news-collections=CLARINET *{nntp.uio.no/CLARINET *{nntp.uio.no/nntp}[clari.*]
                 COMP *{nntp.uio.no/nntp}[comp.*]
                 ALT *{nntp.uio.no/nntp}[alt.*]

I have tried: CLARINET *{nntp.uio.no/119}

I have tried nntp-server=nntp.uio.no 
and leaving out news-collections

But after monitoring nntp.uio.no/119 i find it doesn't get connection
(or even try to).

Does anyone know what's wrong with the configuration?

Subject: User reporting that Pine 3.91 (SunOS 4.1.3) hangs.  Any ideas?
Date: 13 Jan 95 12:19:35 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.789999575@gmi.edu>

I have been using 3.90 on SunOS 4.1.x since it came out, recently upgrading
to 3.91.  Apart from some design philosophy differences with the authors the
only real problem I have had with 3.91 is that it is extremely slow handling
my INBOX of 8500 messages, totalling untold megs of filespace.  It has
honestly been so long since I have used another MUA that I do not know if
that problem is also shared by elm and Mail.  Most of my online time is over
a pseudo tcp/ip connection using term to connect my home Sun to the campus
server and leaving pine open in an xterm, while I use other programs such as
nn, gopher, etc. in other xterms.

In preparation for upgrading the systemwide pine from 3.89 to 3.91, I turned
one of my relatively sophisticated DOS modem users who has been using 3.89
to read news and mail loose on it.  He has had to do a lot of fiddling with
setting that involve control characters that I have not had to deal with.
He finally seems to have that straightened out, but he is reporting that it
has hung several times and kicked him back to the Which Host? prompt that he
gets at his local Michnet dialin point.  I cannot really duplicate his
setup, but have seen nothing like this.  Perhaps the sort of thing that is
happening when pine seems to go to sleep on me for several minutes at a time
is causing more serious problems with his type of connection.

Does anybody else have any similar cases?  Any insight?  I really would like
to update the systemwide pine, but am not in a position to hold people's
hands.

Several thousand grateful users here, many of the "extremely naive"

Without your good work we would have to spend a lot more time teaching

Pine Gurus,

I would like to request that you include the most recent version of the 
pine source in zip format.  We are a vms site and unzip is much easier 
for us that tar and compress.  We like zip because it 
compress/decompresses the files and the structure in one swipe.  I know 
that is one more file to stock, but it might make pine a little more 
universally exportable.

Thanks if you can.

Oh. I think pine is great!!!  Keep up the good work.

When used for the first time, DosPine (3.90) will NOT create the Mail
directory in the users home. 
Is might be a fault in imap (imap-3.6.BETA)?

I am trying to get pine 3.89 to run in a chroot environment on SunOS 
4.1.3. It doesn't want to acknowledge the presence of or send mail.

Any ideas ?

In Pine for UNIX, when selecting multiple messages in the index ( ';'
command) and then printing them ( 'ay' to customer printer, lpr), the
messages are streamed together. Any way to cause a FF between pages? Same
problem with 'pipe'. Didn't notice an option to make each message a 
separate call to the program. Thanks.

Hi!
        I have an account at the University of Toronto, and for the past 2 
years, everything has been working just fine. Yesterday morning, however, 
something happened and I can no longer send mail. I receive incoming mail, 
but every time I try to send mail, I get a statement saying "ZMailer ignored 
send-mail option" and then I get a letter from the post office telling me 
that the user is unknown. I know that the users that I write to are known 
because I've been writing to the successfully for quite a while. My account 
is still open, and the school can't detect any problems. I looked through 
the Help menu, and the only option I think I have is to make statements in 
the editor, but I havn't got a clue how to access the editor, or what to 
say. I would really appreciate it if you could assist me in resolving my 
problem. You can either respond to this address, or to mine: 
bense@ecf.toronto.edu . Thank you!

In your pine's new root, you probably don't have a MTA (sendmail) or 
access to the spools (unless you did set it up that way).

It was REALLY simple. Pine wanted to look in some really bizarre (from my
BSD perspective) place for the mail spool directory. I just set up the
pine.conf to point to /var/spool/mail, and we are up and running.

Thanks for the quick reply !

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers.

Content-Description: What is IMAP?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733.

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine's cancel/postpone/etc key work?

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon
copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as you
compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default
Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich headers command
(Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose it.

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

Subject: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?


Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home
directory called .signature containing the text you want appended to each
message.
   
PC-Pine users should put their signatures in the file \PINE\PINE.SIG.

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail.

the Procmail FAQ.  The hypertext version of these are available at:

Content-Description: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

There are currently two ways to force a new mail check. 
     * Press `Ctrl-L' (Refresh Display). 
     * At the last message in a folder, press 'N' 4-5 times.

Subject: How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?

                                       

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description: Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

Content-Description: Why does Pine encode text attachments?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Subject: How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment?
                                       
   
Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at: 
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Content-Description: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows mail

The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Content-Description: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Content-Description: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

Subject: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

                                     
In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

Subject: How do I make Pine work with my older terminal?

                                       

Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

Content-Description: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?

Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?
                                       

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: To what platforms has Pine been ported?

The Pine distribution includes binaries for AIX 3.2 (on RS/6000), HP/UX
9.0, Linux 1.1, NeXTStep (on NeXT hardware), SunOS 4.1 (on SPARCStations),
Solaris 2.2, Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2 (on DECStations), MS-DOS (PC-Pine) and
MS-Windows (PC-Pine for Windows). 
   
PC-Pine is available for the following TCP/IP stacks: FTP's PC/TCP,
University of Waterloo's WATTCP stack with packet drivers, Novell's LAN
Workplace, Sun's PC/NFS, and Winsock. 
   
Pine has been compiled on other UNIX platforms (4.3 Berkeley UNIX, DEC
OSF/1 V1.2A, Dynix/PTX V1.4.0, VAX Ultrix 4.1, A/UX 3.0, BSD/386 Gamma
4.1, Convex, Dynix 3.0 and 3.1 on Sequent Symmetry, Interactive Systems

Subject: Pine 3.89 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.3 crashes every time I try to open a folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not
correctly compile certain constructs used in Pine 3.89 and earlier. We
think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support.. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

Subject: Why should I use the builtin Bug Report command?

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that 
the problem is specific to that message.

When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point that
a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce
the problem in the current version, our standard response will be to ask
you to upgrade.

work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets

I agree with the joe raves - one thing not mentioned is that joe (and it's
variants) use ispell as a spelling checker.  ispell doesn't just tell you
something is misspelled, it pops up a list of alternates.  You can select an
alternate by number and it replaces it.  You can add words to your private
dictionary.  Based on my observations, usenet NEEDS a good spell checker :-)

>From the Pine FAQ (just updated/posted): 

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

We also have an AIX 3.2.5 system (around 12,000 user accounts).  We've been
on break, but now that people are returning, our Help Desk is also starting
to receive questions about phantom interrupted mail.

Our problem is also the zero length .pine-interrupted-mail file.  We compiled
Pine 3.91 with "#define DEFAULT_DEBUG 0" to help save disk space.  Based on
the information provided by Trey Harris, I wonder if we should go back to the
default debug level.

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages. 

------------
Content-Description: What is MIME?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers. 
If you have a Web browser you can access it through:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/mime/top.html

------------
Content-Description: What is IMAP?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733. 

------------
Content-Description: How can I get a copy of Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I get a copy of Pine?

Pine is available via anonymous ftp from the pine directory of
ftp.cac.washington.edu. 

------------
Content-Description: What documentation is available?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What documentation is available?

The Pine program itself includes extensive online help.  Additional
documentation may be found via anonymous FTP or via World-Wide-Web at the
following locations: 

  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs
  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is bi-directionally
gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.  For official 
          announcements only, you may wish to see pine-announce instead 
          of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
                  subscribe pine-info
 	  in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu. 
          
   Pine-Announce@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Announce is a announcement list for the email program
          Pine. When new Pine products are released and old ones updated,
          a message goes out to this group describing the development. It
          is a very low volume list and includes no discussion
          whatsoever.
          
          NOTE: All messages to this list are automatically forwarded to
          pine-info, so it is not necessary to subscribe to both lists!
          
          To subscribe to pine-announce, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
                  subscribe pine-announce
	  in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-announce@cac.washington.edu.
          
   IMAP@CAC.Washington.EDU 
          This is the official mailing list for the IETF IMAP working
          group and other interested parties. Discussion of the evolving
          IMAP standard and related issues is conducted on this list.
          
          To subscribe to IMAP, send a message to

Content-Description: How many sites use Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow. 

------------
Content-Description: Can we use Pine source code in commercial products?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can we use Pine source code in commercial products?


Pine and C-client source code is copyright by the University of

------------
Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine's cancel/postpone/etc key work?

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

------------
Content-Description: How do I send a message to lots people without showing all the names?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I send a message to lots people without showing all the names?

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon
copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as you
compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default
Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich headers command
(Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose it.

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and

Subject: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?


Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home
directory called .signature containing the text you want appended to each
message.
   
PC-Pine users should put their signatures in the file \PINE\PINE.SIG.

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail.

Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description: Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.

Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at:

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Content-Description: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Content-Description: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line.

Content-Description: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail model
(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,
in a future release.

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Subject: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

                                     
In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: Pine 3.89 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.3 crashes every time I try to open a folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not
correctly compile certain constructs used in Pine 3.89 and earlier. We
think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support.. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages. 

------------
Content-Description: What is MIME?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers. 
If you have a Web browser you can access it through:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/mime/top.html

------------
Content-Description: What is IMAP?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733. 

------------
Content-Description: How can I get a copy of Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I get a copy of Pine?

Pine is available via anonymous ftp from the pine directory of
ftp.cac.washington.edu. 

------------
Content-Description: What documentation is available?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What documentation is available?

The Pine program itself includes extensive online help.  Additional
documentation may be found via anonymous FTP or via World-Wide-Web at the
following locations:

Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is bi-directionally
gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.  For official 
          announcements only, you may wish to see pine-announce instead 
          of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with

Content-Description: How many sites use Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow. 

------------

------------
Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine's cancel/postpone/etc key work?

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

------------
Content-Description: How do I send a message to lots people without showing all the names?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I send a message to lots people without showing all the names?

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon
copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as you
compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default
Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich headers command
(Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose it.

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

Content-Description: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?


Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home
directory called .signature containing the text you want appended to each
message.
   
PC-Pine users should put their signatures in the file \PINE\PINE.SIG.

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail.

the Procmail FAQ.  The hypertext version of these are available at:

Content-Description: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

This is not currently possible.  If it were possible you could use Pine,
and your Pine addressbook, to mail people from within a shell script, at

Subject: How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?

                                       

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description: Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at:

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Content-Description: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows mail

The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Pine does not currently support this directly, but here is a work-around: 
    1. Move the cursor to the Cc: line. 
    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line. 
    4. Move the cursor where you want it in the body of the message. 
    5. Press Ctrl-U to insert the address. 
       
   This is a round-about way to get the job done, but it works...

Content-Description: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

Subject: Can PC-Pine be used with a POP server?

                                       

No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail model
(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,
in a future release.

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Content-Description: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

Subject: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

                                     
In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?
                                       

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: Pine 3.89 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.3 crashes every time I try to open a folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not
correctly compile certain constructs used in Pine 3.89 and earlier. We
think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support.. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that

When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point that
a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce
the problem in the current version, our standard response will be to ask
you to upgrade.

 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

Message-Id: <202_9501131806@dialis.xs4all.nl>

Hallo All!

Does anybody know whether Pine has been ported to OS/2 already, or if anybody
is busy or planning to do so. I think there would be a lot of people
interested in it.

Groetjes, Geert

OK, I'll finally bite.  Where can I get ispell?  Being one of the world's 
worst spellers this is something I need!  We are a SCO shop.

	Does anyone know how I can get this 'enhanced' version of pico to
be the *default* editor (as opposed to the alternate editor)? I've tried
figuring out how to do it by recompiling Pine, but I'm not exactly a
computer guru. :) Thanks...

Sorry for the long quoting, but I couldn't figure out what wasn't important.

I sent myself a cc:Mail to internet message a few hours ago.  The attached
file was a wordperfect file.  Pine got it and the note attached to the
message from the cc:Mail gateway told me it had uuencoded the 
attachment.  I've sent many things via Pine to my office and found that 
zip files were recognized and handled by cc:Mail properly but everything 
else comes out MIMEd.

When I was using elm, I often sent uuencoded files to my office and they 
were converted (uudecoded) into zip files when they landed in my cc:Mail box.

Are there any plans to port Pine over to the Mac?  Do you know of any 
programs out there ala Pine for the Mac?

Subject: 0.0 About this Article

Q: How can I have my incoming mail messages automatically put into an 
   appropriate folder?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This article 
is the first release of an FAQ that addresses this question.  This version 
gives basic instructions for how to set up either procmail or Elm's filter 
to filter incoming mailing list messages.  Future versions of this FAQ will 
include instructions for doing other things like automatically replying to 
certain messages.

If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the Elm and filter developers
recommend procmail over filter.

Subject: ... 0.6 Reading the Plain Text Version of This Article

If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext version) of 
this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is formatted 
as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and sometimes 
 Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
instruction for some newsreaders:

* NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
  menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
  your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
  format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest item 
  on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc. individual 
  digest items.

* In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g (Ctrl key 
  and g key pressed together) to skip to the next line that begins with
  "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).


If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that allows
you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you can
use your mailer or newsreader (if it can read mail folders) to read the
folder.  For example, here's what you would do in Tin while viewing
the article:

Type...                           In order to...
-------                           --------------

a                                 Specify the article is to be piped
formail -ds >> ~/mail/faq.split   Split the digest into individual
                                  messages and put them in a file named
                                  ~/mail/faq.split.  (Replace ~/mail
                                  with your folder directory.)
pine -if faq.split                Use Pine to read the newly created folder.

Subject: 1.0 Naming Your Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with ``IN''.
For example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a
folder named IN.procmail.  I do this so that when all my folders
are listed alphabetically the incoming folders are together and
near the top.  They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive
and upper case letters come before lower case letters in an ascii
sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders.

Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up procmail to
filter incoming mailing list messages.

To find out how to process existing mail folders see the NOTES section

Subject: ... 2.1 Setting Up Procmail

1] Find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using csh type:

     which procmail

   Or if you are using sh or ksh type:

     type procmail

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``whereis'' and
   ``where''.  If your system doesn't have procmail ask your system 
   administrator to install it.  If your sys admin isn't able to do this,
   use a different mail processor like deliver, mailagent, or filter 
   (described in part 2 of this FAQ).


2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

  
2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace ``mail'' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd
     cd .procmail
     pico rc.test


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.test:

      :0:
      * ^Subject: .*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in the subject "Explanation of Test Recipe" below.


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace ``nancym'' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file: If 
      procmail resides below your home directory write out the *full* path.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
    ``test'' in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were
    delivered correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can determine what
      the problem is.  

    * Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.test

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.procmailrc so
      that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  If you are still having problems see the 
      subject "Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail" below.

   
8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.folders for filtering incoming messages into mail folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.folders


8b] Enter a modified version of the following in ~/.procmail/rc.folders

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second recipe
     filters the procmail mailing lists  The meaning of the first recipe is 
     as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     Create a recipe for each of your mailing lists.  Make sure that you
     use ``^TO'' with no space between the caret (^) and the word ``TO'', 
     and that both letters are capitalized -- if you don't it won't work.

     Note that ^TO is not a normal regular expression.  It is a special
     procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination 
     specification.  See the MISCELLANEOUS section of the procmailrc(5)
     man page for details.  For examples, see procmailex(5) man page.
     

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.test line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.test
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.folders

     Note that it's useful to leave the rc.test line there for future testing.

Subject: ... 2.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

There is a useful script, which is part of the procmail package, for 
checking your procmail log file called mailstat.  Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either ``which mailstat'' or ``type mailstat''.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  It is located with all the other procmail tools at:

ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

Subject: ... 2.4 Troubleshooting: Alternate .forward Files for Procmail

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

Some systems do not need a .forward file (i.e., having a .procmailrc file 
suffices if procmail already is the local delivery agent).

Subject: 3.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

------------------------------

Date: 17 Nov 1994 23:03:10 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: ... 3.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

Subject: ... 3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

Message-Id: <3f6ml8$g2c@abaco.coastalnet.com>


I am trying to use pine 3.89 as the mail tool of choice for users
on my SunOs 4.1.3 system.

We have set up a "chroot" environment, and pine does not want to 
acknowledge the existence of mail, not will it send it when run in the 
"chroot'ed" environment.

/bin/mail and /usr/ucb/mail are quite happy in the chroot environment, 
and pine runs fine when run as a 'trusted' user. (outside the chroot)

Any suggestions ?

Radney,
See ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.software for a list of all 
known IMAP clients.  

We do not currently have funding for a Mac version of Pine, but who knows 
what the future might bring...

-teg

p.s. You can always run MachTen's Unix emulator on your Mac; there is a 
port of Pine for that!

I'd recommend using Eudora.  There are both shareware and commercial 
versions of this.  You need a POP3 server on your unix box to serve the 
mail to the mac.  One nice thing about the commercial version on Eudora 
is that it will filter mail for you.

Take a look at Qualcomm's home page for info (http://www.qualcomm.com/).

You can find the shareware version on most big mac archives.  I'd suggest

ftp://ftp.hawaii.edu/mirrors/info-mac/comm/tcp/mail/eudora-151.hqx

This brings to light a configuration problem I am having regarding local 
news access. Most of my users on this host would like to peruse the news, 
available on the locally-installed INN server. 

First, I tried setting the 'nntp-server' variable in 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed, and discovered that this did not set up 
the default news folder. I then switched it to the 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf, and then discovered that the 'news-collections' 
had been set by default to <No Value Set: using 
*{campus.qro.itesm.mx/nntp}[]> 

Since I want them to do a local access (and save a few cycles on the 
nnrpd), I tried setting 'news-collections' to "News *[]". Unfortunately, 
this doesn't work: none of the [previously configured] groups on the 
.newsrc files are seen and when you try to subscribe and request to go to 
all groups, it says there are no groups to select from ! Is there a 
confirmed way to do local access, instead of having to go thru the nnrp ?
BTW, the local news server's directory hierarcy is located on /news, with 
a symlink in /var/spool/news pointing to it.

Thanks for your help.

hello..i was very happily suprised to find that pine had been fully
compiled to run under vms...there were only minor hitches until time came
to execute the vmsbuild.com in the /pine subdirectory (the one for building
the pine executable itself)  The problem was that this file did not appear
to be included in the tar file....any pointers as to its whereabouts would
make me very happy...
        thanks,
        jesse

Can someone provide insight into how I can segment mail attachments into
multiple parts?  My users want to be able to send mail messages which 
can be quite large 30-900k and my SMTP mailer(ultrix) seems to strip

As far as I know cc:Mail itself does not handle encoding/decoding. Lotus 
Link to UUCP does handle MIME / uuencoded attachments properly. 
I.e. Send a MIME message from internet through UUCPLink to cc:Mail and
the received mail will have an attachment.

Could somebody provide an example of "A good cc:Mail<->Internet

Out of curiosity, I was wondering what would happen if you have activated 
to K-Block feature of PINE, and before you return to exit it, your 
connection is lost?  WIll it reset the K-BLOCK or lock it up?  Or will 
you just need to re-enter your password the next time you enter PINE?

  Chip,
   As far as the environment that I am running, I'm not quite sure what 
you mean.  At Prodigy, we won't be able to access FTP until February.  I 
recieved a ANSI II file, the first part written in ANSI II, the second 
portion written in code.  The sender notified me that I needed "pine" to 
decode the file, an all-files list for a BBS.  As far as recieving e-mail 
on Prodigy, we can recieve anything that can be sent.  
   Thanks for the help, hope this discription helps you a little me.  
Thanks again,

                                                                           
        Jim

I tried that but PICO (the editor in PINE) screwed with the formatting 
and the file did not work when exported and the header removed. I ended 
up just going to their branch office here in Seattle and mailing it 
through their cc:mail network. I thank everybody for their replies. My 
corporation shall be mailing out to all different types of systems and 
although I will probably hire someone for this I need to know this 
information anyways. Thank you all.

I just saw this same problem when I upgraded users to Pine 3.91 from 
3.87. When printing long messages, the terminal hangs and the printer 
stops short of finishing the message. It seems to happen with only _some_ 
terminal emulation packages and _certain_ printers. I have found a work 
around. You need to add the following entry to your feature-list. This 
acn either be done in the .pinerc or from the Setup Config menu

preserve-start-stop-characters

This made it disappear for all of my users. But be warned, you can press 
the wrong control key and Pine will stop. Read the help screen that is 
found in the setup menu on this feature. This probelm only surfaced when 
switvhing to the new Pine. No of my users ever had the problem before.

Hope this helps your plight.

To print a message using Pine's attached-to-ansi with Procomm for 
Windows, first activate Printer Capture (using either the toolbar icon 
or from the File menu), then issue the 'y' print command. When Pine is 
done 'printing' the message, then click Procomm's Printer Capture icon 
again to deactivate printer capture and initiate output to the printer. 
At that point, the message should print out on your PC printer.

I am using Procomm for Windows version 1.02 and Pine version 3.89 and it 
works fine as described.

Anyone out there know if there is a way to turn off this question?  An 
older version of Pine never bothered to ask and that's how I liked it!

Thanks.

Uri.

PS- An email response would be great since I don't frequent this newsgroup.

Pine--it is a truly useful program.  Are you guys making anything from 
this?  You should be.  I must have shown five people how to use pine at 
work today.  Fortunately that wasn't very difficult.  

When I used another email program (shudder), It would print the name of 
the listserver in the FROM: section of the header, rather than the 
individual that posted the message.  This would be nice to be able to do 
in Pine, because I am trying to develop a crude script with telix that 
will sort my incoming listserv mail.  Also, will any future incarnations 
of pine have threaded messages?  This would be nice when reading news.  
Finally, is there anyway I can sort my news by subject and my normal mail 
by arrival time?   Thanks!

Hi, all.

I need to know if there is a way to change the number of

line instead of 80. Can it be configured that way?

Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated.

	Place the cursor at the start of the block of text and press 
Control-^(Control-6 on the IBM keyboard).  Then move the cursor to the 
end of the block and press Control-K to cut the block of selected text.

I sent the following message to the pine-bugs email address and got back 
the standard automated reply saying my message would probably not be 
answered more specifically but suggesting I send my questions to the 
pine-info list which is what I am doing here. Replies directly to me 
and/or to the pine-info email list would be highly appreciated.

  Can anyone help with the following two problems:

Subject: Printing and Saving

I have been using Pine on my email account at The Hebrew University in 
Jerusalem for several years and love it. They now have installed Pine 
3.91 which I assume is a fairly updated version. I have two questions.

1) SAVING some time ago I wrote you all asking about whether there was any 
way to automatically save any sent message, not to the general SENT-MAIL 
folder, but to the same folder that the incoming mail message being 
replied is saved to by default with the save command. For example, if I 
get a message from someone for whom the default save folder is Joe, when 
I send a reply it will automatically (by default) be saved to the same 
Joe folder, not to the general SENT-MAIL folder. I had this feature on a 
mailer I was using when I had an account on an IBM/VM machine several 
years ago and it is the only thing I miss with PINE. The answer I got 
from you is that this feature was in planning but not yet implemented. 
Has there been any futher progress on getting such a feature into Pine?

2) PRINTING. When I try to print to a printer "slaved" to my PC using the
^Y command I get the following results. If it is a short file or incoming
message I am trying to print from within Pine, it prints but at the end of
the printing I get a flashing error message saying I need to set the
xon/xoff "preserve start stop character feature" in Config and I find the
computer is hung and I can only get unhung by breaking out of the session 
and login on again to my mainfram account. If it is longer document, it 
also doesn't print ok, but I have a string of ^Q^S every so often in the 
printout. 

I am using a special version of Kermit, prepared by the Hebrew U to 
permit use of Hebrew characters a well. This is what the computer center 
here recommends as a communications protocol package. I am printing to a 
HP laser printer over a Novelle network. I don't this this is the problem 
since I have tried printing files not from pine, but from my Unix account 
directly to the printer using a command PrintPC and this works just fine. 
I am connected to the my mainframe account using a modem set to 2400 baud 
with MNP3 error correction. I have the Pine printer setup set to 
"attached to ansi" option. Other settings such as LPR seem to send 
output to lineprinter attached to mainframe which is miles from where I 
am so that is not a solution for me.

Setting the preserve start stop character feature also does not seem to 
solve the problem of printing to the slaved laser printer. I still get 
the same problem of getting hung with the same flashing error message. 
Also the commands Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q which are I understand supposed to 
freeze and restore flow control (according to Pine Help on this feature) 
don't seem to have any effect.

Is there anything else you would suggest to try to resolve this problem?
Thanks for your help.

   Yes, use ';' to select all the parts, then "a|uudecode" to decode them. 
   Note that the parts need to be listed in order in the index before doing

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE


I am having trouble sending 8bit characters using pine.  I want to define=
=20
in the header "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" and can do that.  The=20
trouble is when pine finds any foreign characters in the text (as it=20
will in this message), it defines it's own C-T-E header with=20
QUOTED-PRINTABLE, which overwrites my header.  It does this just silently=
=20
when sending mail, but gives a error message because of duplicate headers=
=20
when I try to post to a news-group.  So I had to remove my header to be=20
able to send this message.

This means that if the people I send mail to are using e.g. Elm, the=20
message is unreadable.  If they on the other hand are using pine it is=20
readable, but still has the disadvantage of when it is saved, the file=20
does not include the characters in their right form, while mail sent using=
=20
the 8bit encoding does.

I hope someone has a solution to this problem.

Thanks in advance, Halld=F3r

A lot will depend upon what gateway you are using to get Internet based
email into and out of the cc:Mail world.  It is my understanding that the
Lotus gateways (UUCP/SMTP) do not yet have support for MIME, so there 
would be problems if you tried to get MIME messages in through one of these
gateways.  There are a few third party gateways on the market (Internet 
Exchange for cc:Mail from our company is one), which should provide the
functionality you are looking for however.

I wouldn't, and I'll tell you why.

I don't know what sort of disk quota you give your 12,000 users, but we
give our 15,000 three megabytes each.  For some months we ran Pine 3.90
with the default debug level.  In November, we upgraded to 3.91 with the
debug option turned off.

This was coincidental to a real disk crunch; we had the physical disk for
the explosion of around two hundred extra users a week, but with AIX3's
two-gigabyte limit on filesystems it was going to be a very laborious
process to move all those old users. 

Immediately after making the Pine upgrade, we ran a process to run 
through all the user's home directories and delete the 
.pine-debug* files.

Even as our user base has grown by three thousand since that time, WE HAVE 
NOT HAD TO WORRY ABOUT USER DISK SPACE SINCE.  We gained close to one 
GIGABYTE by making this change, and since you're at about the same scale, 
you'll lose about that much.

That's how much disk space those .pine-debug files take up.  I've spoken 
to a *bunch* of people who say they're having the .pine-interrupted-mail 
problem, all on AIX 3.2.5 boxes.  Are the Pine developers out there?  Are 
they listening?

(That's the one problem with using free software.  If there's a serious
serious bug that only affects a relatively small number of people, and
you're one of them, you can't get any help to fix it.  Sigh.)

I just began using pine as a newsreader and basically like it.  My 
question is this: Is there a way to put all messages of a thread into one 
line (like nn).  You see the original post on one line and then the 
replies scattered throughout the list (like rn).  Personally I don't like 
this, can someone answer this?  Thanks.

Mike

That's the trouble with people using our code in environments that we 
can't replicate :)

Seriously, we have tried several times to reproduce this bug without 
success.  If anyone *can* reproduce it on demand, or run under a debugger 
until it happens, we could really use your help in getting to the bottom 
of this problem.

Halld=F3r,
The best solution is for your recipients to use MIME-capable tools.
Elm users can add metamail support to Elm for handling MIME encoding of
8bit characters.

Pine users can either Save from the *attachment index*, or use the
*Export* command, rather than use the Save message command, if they wish
to have the stored text file fully decoded.  (Pine's message Save cmd will
always preserve the Quoted-Printable C.T.E.)

Pine will never support "just-send-8bit" as this approach violates
Internet mail standards.  However, version 3.92 *will* negotiate with
ESMTP-capable MTAs to do 8BITMIME.  (Don't ask when 3.92 will be ready.=20
We don't know yet.)

Message-Id: <3fcdd3$sp8@newsreader.wustl.edu>

       I am using PINE as a mailreader (but not a newreader).  I have no 
trouble printing documents with the "y" command.   I would like to be 
able to print each message on a separate piece of paper, but the system 
as it is set up runs the various documents together.  (For example, if I 
give *separte* "y" commands for messages 4, 12 and 23, I will get those 
three documents printed, seriatum, on the same piece of paper.)  My 
system administrator doesn't understand why this is happening.  Does 
anyone else have any ideas ?  Is there something I can add to my file to 
correct this ?  (If it is significant:  I use PCAnywhere to connect to my 
internet account by phone line; I work on a 386SX computer (no laughing) 
which is part of a Novell network which includes a shared printer.  

      I would be very grateful for any ideas about how to fix this.  Thanks.

Message-Id: <3fcdms$c6f@gandalf.pic.net>

I am currently using Pine for mail, and Rtin for news. I like Pine much
better, but have been unable to configure it to handle News.

I am using Linux running on a 486 box, with a leased line Internet
connection. Mail is using Sendmail -- that works fine with Pine.
News is using nntp to my Internet provider's news server. Rtin works
OK -- as a matter of fact, there was no configuration required beyond
setting the NNTPSERVER variable. But, it is not the most user friendly
reader, particularly to my users from the DOS world.

Where do I find information on how to configure Pine to work in my
configuration? I would appreciate any help.

In certain situations the content-transfer-encoding q-p 
in a text/plain part is not decoded before inserting it
in a reply.

The situation when I noticed it was when replying to a
multipart/alternative message, where the first part was
text/plain and the second was application/quickmail. The first
part was inserted but just "as is", i.e. with the "=xx" strings
left.

When inserting text of the original message in a reply, no line
wrapping is done. This is not manageable when the lines are
very long.

Some UA:s makes one text paragraph into one message line,
and breaks it up with q-p soft line breaks. Is this,
by the way, correct and well-behaved MIME-usage? I can't
find any words against it in RFC 1521.

I'm no expert, but I don't think you need the file name at all.  In fact, 
I would try just:

  jetpr -h | lpr -dlj

and see what happens.

I sometimes use pine on a remote system.  In this situation printing a 
mail message doesn't produce the desired results, unless you enjoy driving 
across town (or country!)

So I wrote a little script that will print mail messages to a file.  You 
can print several at a time and it won't overwrite them.

Just detach, change a few paths, and put it in your printer setup.

Yes, though it isn't 100% foolproof.  In the folder index for the Inbox, 
hit "$" to sort, then "o" to sort by ordered subject.  This places all 
messages with the same subject together, in order by date.
 
If you decide that you like it, you can make it the default sort method 
as follows:
 
 o At Pine's main menu press "s" (setup)
 o Press "c" (congiguration)
 o Scroll through the configuration options until you find "sort-key"
 o Move down to highlight "ordered subject"
 o Press Return to mark that option
 o Press "e" to exit setup.
 
>From then on your folder indexes will be sorted by ordered subject when 
you start up Pine.

Subject: Smaller binary for Pine 3.91!
Date: 15 Jan 95 21:02:43 GMT
Message-Id: <parastat.790203763@alpha.it.teithe.gr>


Hello everyboy,

I have already compiled Pine 3.91 on a DEC3100 Alpha system running OSF1
v1.3. My problem is that the executable is near 3.3Mb. I want it to be
smaller. So my thought was not to include some features of Pine, like
motd, mh. 

I found that I can exclude these by erasing their names from the
DEFAULTDRIVERS variable of the Makefile. But I don't know what every
driver is for. Can anyone help me with this?

Any other way of reducing the binary size of pine is more than welcome. 

Thank you very much,
--

Totally agree that it is a great program.  Unfortunately unless we let 
the development team know, it may stop at the next release due to cuts.

I would recommend using procmail for this.  Procmail is another great 
"free" program which can be used for filtering incoming mail.  There are 
many things which you can do with procmail such as set up auto-replies 
etc.  If you need further information, please feel free to mail me.

The only way I know of doing this will only work if the receipient has a 
MTA (such as sendmail) which understands Return-Receipt-To:.

If this is the case, then set up a customised header. 

Please note that Return-Receipt-To: is not intended to be used all the 
time but more as debugging tool.

Subject: PICO on Linux annoyance..
Date: 16 Jan 1995 10:11:05 GMT
Message-Id: <3fdgnp$4p0@news.u.washington.edu>

Problem is this: PICO always has an 'a' with an umlaut over it
(those two little dots) in the upper left-hand square.  It's only
an annoyance, as it's a spot where text never will be, but it's
ugly and I'm afraid it'll scare my users.. <g>  This was a problem
with the PICO included in my Linux distribution and one I compiled
myself from the source.  The 'a' is below the highlighted top line but
above all the text -- there is a single line there w/no text, and
that's where it is.  Oh, yeah -- it's highlighted.

Anyone run into this, or have any ideas?

Thanks in advance,
Craig.

	Hmm, perhaps I am just daft or haven't found the right function
yet but: How do I make a whole subject marked in such a way that I don't
have to see it any more? I mean in whatever version of rn you got there is
a "junk subject" or something equally sound. I don't crave for the command
to eXpunge them as well, but it would be great though. I suppose one could
sort the subjects and then just read what one is interested in and so on
but still...
	Ok, that was what I wondered about and if there isn't any command 
like this I think there should be one.

On SunOS the bin is over 2.5 M.  Stripping reduces it to less than 1.5M.
You might also make sure the binary is linked dynamically.

Missive, from our company, is another.  Missive integrates all the leading
mail systems (cc:Mail, SMTP, VMSmail, Microsoft Mail, etc) into one
seamless network.  Missive's SMTP inbound channel can decode MIME and turn
the attachment into the appropriate format for the destination, be it
cc:Mail or whatever.  In the other direction, the SMTP outbound channel
can encode attachments into MIME as well.

	When PINE's new V. kicked in a few months ago my provider lost a 
lot of my addresses. With my backup I I tried to re-insert them but it 
didn't work at all! PINE looked at my backup and used every line as the 
nickname line only and so its a MESS! I hope someone can tell me what I 
can do to recover the thousands of addresses for me. I'm so depressed.

by voting for your favorite Internet Entrepreneur and telling us what is 
your favorite Internet store front.

This contest is sponsored by The Internet Business Journal, for our 
March issue (our first annual Internet Marketing Awards).

Here is how to enter the contest:

(1)  Tell us who you think is the Internet Entrepreneur of 1994 and 
explain why.

(2) Tell us what your favorite Internet store is and explain why (to 
qualify, the store must have been open for business on the Net in 1994).

(3) Tell us what you think was the most creative advertising on the 
Internet in 1994 and explain why.

(4) Tell us what you think was the worst advertising on the Internet in 
1994 and explain why.

Contest Rules:

Only entries sent by e-mail to michael@strangelove.com will be 
accepted. Only one entry per person will be accepted. Send in two 
entries and you will be disqualified from the draw.

Valid entries must answer all questions. Entries must be received before 
midnight, February 20, 1995. The winner will be determined by random 
selection from all valid entries. We retain full copyright on all 
submissions. We reserve the right to publish any submissions. We 
reserve the right to publish the winner's name and e-mail address.

The Prize: Five hundred dollars (Canadian funds).

Why are we doing this?

We are curious to see how often lawyers will be picked and for which 
categories.

Also, The Internet Business Journal's March issue will present our first 
annual Internet Marketing Awards and Internet Entrepreneur of the 
year. We think that the people most qualified to pick the winners are the 
Internet community members and not some greasy advertising executive 
who normally tries to figure out new ways of selling cigarettes to 
children.

Think of it as our way of helping to create a Spam-Free Internet.

We are Strangelove Internet Enterprises, purveyors of fine Internet 
publications. Watch us in 1995 as we demonstrate what creative 
Internet marketing is all about. Reviews of our latest book, How to 
Advertise on the Internet, are available at 
http://arganet.tenagra.com/Tenagra/books.html.

Message-Id: <3fagr9$kpb@news.primenet.com>

  Today I installed JOE 2.2 (the version provided at PrimeNet) in Pine 3.91.

  No sooner did I try to write my first sentence with it, then the program
inserted unwanted letters in the typed words; it sometimes inserted
unwanted groups of letters in strange places. 

  I want a text editor which helps, not confounds me. JOE has been removed.

In the folder index pressing the keys "$s" will sort the folder on subject.
This, I believe, is the closest Pine comes to threading.

Hi there everyone!
	Could someone out there help me to get my laser printer to print 
pine mail.  I am able to print stuff out using a computer that is 
attached to regular dot matrix printer attached to another computer.  The 
command line when I request to print says "attached-to-ansi" or something 
like that.  However, this does nothing when I am on a computer that is 
attached to a laser printer.  PLEASE HELP ME!!!!
	I don't usually get this mail group, so those of you who do reply 
will have to respond directly to me:
	My address : kahatapitiya@mayo.rcf.edu
			507 284 4928
	Many thanks,
			Ravi.

Hello Pine Folks:

I'm truly in need of help.  I want to use the packet version of
PC Pine 3.91 to connect via a SLIP connection to my school's
mail/news system.  I am using the Univ. of Minnesota's UMSLIP.COM
Packet driver for SLIP, version 2.1 and PHONE.EXE to dial into
my school's slip server.  Gopher, Minuet and DosLynx are working
great.  Whenever I try to run Pine, I get an error message stating
that BOOTP failed.  When I manually enter my IP address, gateway,
nameserver, etc., Pine returns a message stating that my INBOX cannot
be opened because the [Host cannot be found].

I can successfully run the packet version of PC Pine with the Crynwr
Packet driver for a 3c509 NIC, version 11.2.  I do not use BOOTP
when I use the Crynwr 3c509 packet driver.

Any thoughts as to what the problem is?

Several users on campus are now using pine on AIX (some former
elm users) and pc-pine, and enquiries are coming in on handling
mailing lists.  In 3.91 can an addressbook reside on AIX and:

1) be firstly shared and used by several users, this seems
probable once access has been worked out.
2) be used by pc-pine users as well 
3) be updated by a pc-pine user
4) suppress the list of cc recipients

Thanks for your guidance in this area.  Mailing list management
seems to be a hot topic here especially with a mix of elm and
pine users on different platforms so if anyone with experience could
comment I would appreciate the input.

Yes, I have run into this.  I too originally had the PICO that came
distributed with LINUX, and it has the same strange 'bugs' in it as
you describe.  I really don't have any idea why it is like this.  

I recently picked up another PICO binary from ftp.cac.washington.edu
and this one does NOT have those same problems.  It is version 2.5,
in the /pine/unix-bin directory as pico-bin.linux.

Why does Pine send the following construct:

Shouldn't it send:

 +   I have 2 enhancement suggestions for easier use of Pine

 +      into the last expanded list. Otherwise I have to press
 +      <CR> and wait for the expanded list of newsgroups to be
 +      generated again.

You can set this option in the Setup/Config screen by selecting this option:

                [X] expanded-view-of-folders

 +   2. Is there a way to show the number of messages on a particular
 +      newsgroup list from the "Expanded List" screen so that I get
 +      a visual notification of which newsgroups have messages
 +      without having to Select the newsgroup?

Good point what would be nicer is if it notifies as to how many new messages,
as supposed to just the number of messages.

8500 messages in the INBOX?
How about reading/deleting/moving/saving read mail elsewhere....things can get
much better then. Doncha think so ?

 +   I am at the beginner level with UNIX and, for better or worse, I have
 +   been made the mail administrator of our Sun SPARC station.  I managed to
 +   configure sendmail to work and now our users want something more user
 +   friendly in a  mail system.  Any pointers on where to find an
 +   installation document is greatly appreciated.

There's a pre-compiled binary for Pine.SUN avail at:

ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin/pine-bin.sun

There's also a Solaris version if you are using Solaris instead of SunOS 4.1+

Yes, create the file "pine.pwd" in the same directory that your pinerc is in.
Then you will be asked if you want your password saved.

: say few screen fills and then del it!!! 

On mine it's:
CTRL^ - start block marking
CTRL K - cut the marked block
CTRL U - paste the cut.

Subject: Specify alternate IMAP login name?
Message-Id: <D2JFvM.8IA@cunews.carleton.ca>
Date: Tue, 17 Jan 1995 07:09:22 GMT

I have several accounts on various networks around our campus. Most have 
my standard username (csaldanh). But, two accounts that I have impose 
numbered accounts, rather than proper usernames.

When I enter pine, it asks me to log into my IMAP server. But, it always 
feeds me my acutal account login name as the default. On those two 
accounts, I have to erase that name, and type in the proper one 
(csaldanh) to log into IMAP.

Is it possible to specify an alternate IMAP login name with pine 3.89? If 
not, could pine be setup to type out some keystrokes (a bunch of 
backspaces, and then "csaldanh") using the "startup keystrokes" default? 
How do I specify the backspaces?

Other than this little annoyance, I must say that I find pine and IMAP 
amazingly useful tools. They have rendered my email management so 
simple. Can't imagine why anyone would use POP...

We are experiencing a problem with the "From:" field in our pine messages.

It reads:

	From: johnf@sparc

Rather than the desired:

	From: johnf@sparc.nic.bc.ca


	The steps we've taken so far are:

	Created 'pine.conf.fixed' in the directory where Pine 3.91 resides.
	Set the 'user-domain=' to the following:

	# Sets domain part of From: and local addresses in outgoing mail.
	user-domain=nic.bc.ca

	Please respond via E-mail any suggestions you might have as to 
	what we're missing.
	
	Regards,
	johnf@sparc.nic.bc.ca


	P.S.  There was a message posted a few days ago, requesting info 
about compiling PINE with GCC under Solaris operating system.  You might 
try the following:

 
Add the following line to the CFLAGS in the makefile.sol in the pine and
pico subdirs.
 
-Dconst=
 
that should do it.

No, tin saves files by default in the ~/News directory.
To change this go to the .tin directory and look in the tinrc file

Subject: Controlling header-contents display
Date: Tue, 17 Jan 1995 11:01:57 +0100
From: Peter Svanberg <psv@nada.kth.se>

I would like good tools to control how header contents
are displayed on screen. I see three ways to do this:

(1) Define some configuration language with which you
    can specify how the headers should be used. MH
    has a *bad* - but usable - example of such a language
    in it's "mhl" facility.

(2) Allow the user to filter it himself, i.e. to define a
    filter which, given all the headers (and maybe the screen
    dimensions and display type and...), returns a string which
    should be output to the screen.

(3) Define a configuration parameter "default-message-hdrs" (in
    line with default-composer-hdrs and customized-hdrs) which
    defines which set of headers which normally should be
    displayed (i.e. when FULL HEADERS is off).

I guess at least (3) would be valuable to many but I hope
there are others than me who dislikes the space consuming (and
ugly) <tag>:<value> display of headers, which would like (1)
or (2) or something else.

I would like to have any of the possibilities mentioned above, in case
 (3) I would prefere to say what I don't like to see instead of what I
like to see or, at least:

 (4) Define a configuration parameter which would control if rich
     headers are off or on after starting pine.

Date: Tue, 17 Jan 1995 11:32:05 +0100
From: Peter Svanberg <psv@nada.kth.se>

There is no boundaries between messages if you do
Apply Pipe. When you do Apply Export, a faked "From " line is
inserted as a boundary(*). Could this be done with Apply
Pipe also, controlled by (for example) a configuration
parameter message-boundaries-in-pipe? (Or all-data-in-pipe,
implying message boundaries *and* all headers.)

(Yes, I want to filter output of message header contents
before printing also... (see my previous note).)

(*) There seems to be a bug in the faking-"From "-line code:
    Missing SPACE between address and date.

In the course of investigating a problem report from one of my users, I 
made some changes to the config, and then realised that I did not want to 
make those changes to that config. However, there was then no way of 
backing out except by reversing those changes. 

In the "good old days" pre 3.90, when such edits were made with an editor,
I always kept a backup copy. Now that things are improved, I wonder if ^C
in Config could exit without saving changes (with of course a prompt).

Using pine i can get access to lots of news groups but only a handful of 
alt. groups.
 
Does anyone know how to access more groups.

Is there a site on the internet that can be accessed by FTP or GOPHER 
that may have more newsgroups?

I think there should be an address for newsgroups, if theyre on the 
internet.

	thanks,

Message-Id: <3fgeqa$7bt@usenet.srv.cis.pitt.edu>

Hi
Dear wizards,

I am using pine in unix to send mails. I have 10 big files named "filex.txt"
where x=1,...,10 stored in directory named "myfiles". So the files are:
"myfiles/file1.txt" to "myfiles/file10.txt"

I want to send these files to an adress via Email (preferably pine) with the
subject heading of each file as "This is the subject of file x" where 
x=1,...,10

Is there any way to automate this? The address that I send is not known
beforehand, so it might be nice if it can be entered as input. The reasons 
that files are separate is because they are big.

Thank you for the solution!
Sincerely Wizard

I hope not.  This means that any old turkey could read your mail.  Even
if your mainframe was set to look at the PC address instead of a

yours...and after the resulting crash of the subnets, get logged on

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Of those mentioned, I have found procmail to be the best of the lot.

The faq for procmail can be found at:

When you are in the header section of the email, press ^R (control R) and 
this will bring up what pine calls rich headers.  In here, you will find 
a Bcc field.

Hi,
I'm not sure how to do this with pine, but you could try a simple 
shell script something along the following...

#!/bin/sh

echo -n "Enter mail address to send files to: "
read Address

cd myfiles
for i in file*
do
	mailx -s "This is the subject of $i" $Address < $i
echo "sent $i"
done

-------------------------------------------------------------

The above script will be dependent on version of un*x you are running, 
and what mailers you have at your disposal, (some local mailers don't 
have a subject line for the command line interface - mailx does).

Regards

Alan Byrne

Whoa!  Did I read that right?  3.92 may be the last release of pine?

Who do I e-mail to tell them that I *love* pine and I am so happy that 
it's well-written, well-supported and free!  (A very rare combination.)

I am sure that the developers will see this just by sending it to 
pine-info.  If that is not the case I am sure they will let you know.

At the Index screen press the following keys:

;		- Go into select mode

Sure.  You can find MIME pack and unpack routines (mpack/munpack) on 
ftp.sco.com, buried somewhere in the Skunkware CD directories.  They 
start at either /Skunk or /pub/Skunk.  A few minutes of nosing around 
should find them for you.  If you completely fail to find them, let me 
know and I'll look them up and get back to you with the full path.

Getting a fully qualified domain name is done by functions in the files
canonicl and domnames in the directory .../pine/osdep of the Pine
distribution.  Both of these files use gethostbyname.  My experience is
that the gethostbyname of SunOS 5.3 (a part of Solaris 2.3) does not give
a FQDN.  I'm not sure but I think that if Pine expects a FQDN, and so
other parts may not work if a FQDN is not obtained.  If I don't know what
happens in SunOS 5.4 (a part of Solaris 2.4) because we do not have that
yet. 

Here is a test program:
---cut here---
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/utsname.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <string.h>

int main ()
{
    char hname[512];
    struct hostent *he;
    struct utsname un;

    (void) uname(&un);
    strcpy(hname, un.nodename);
    printf("the name of the machine is: %s\n", hname);

    he = gethostbyname(hname);
    if(he == NULL) {
        printf("unfortunately he is NULL\n");
    } else {
        printf("gethostbyname gives: %s\n", he->h_name);
    }
    return 0;
}
---cut here---

On a SunOS 5.3 computer, I used Sun's unbundled cc:
   cc testdom.c -l nsl -o testdom
   testdom
and got the following:
   the name of the machine is: hercules
   gethostbyname gives: hercules

On a SunOS 4.1.3 computer, I used Sun's cc:
   cc testdom.c -o testdom
   testdom
and got the following:
   the name of the machine is: perseus
   gethostbyname gives: perseus.dur.ac.uk

On an HP-UX 9.01 computer, I used HP's cc:
   cc testdom.c -o testdom
   testdom
and got the following:
   the name of the machine is: pahang
   gethostbyname gives: pahang.dur.ac.uk

Aside: the version of Pine used here in Durham has had patches to the two
files mentioned above to add the ".dur.ac.uk" bit to the end.  Yuk.

I too have been impressed by the "superpico" mode of joe2.5 and would
encourage anyone who wants a more powerful - but highly compatible -
alternative to pico to give it a try. 

There are a few omissions from the key mappings in the .jpicorc file
supplied with joe2.5.  I passed these on to the author and they may be
included in 2.6; I haven't had time to check yet.  What may bother more
people is that a (very) few keys in the .jpicorc have different meaning
from those in pico itself: e.g. ^T becomes spell check word only (ESC T is
used to spell check the whole file) and ^@ (or Ctrl-space) is no longer
used to move forward by word. 

I've tweaked my own .jpicorc so that *all* keys have exactly the same
meaning as in pico itself, but one still has all the added functionality. 
If anyone would like a copy let me know; I can post it on this newsgroup
if there is sufficient interest.

I haven't been able to figure out how to use "pine -I <initial commands>"
for input strings (other than command keys).  If anyone knows how, please
post.  Of course, what I really want is to be able to write macros for
Pine...

I agree - soon Pine and IMAP will take over the world!

In looking at the select options (for a zoom to follow) I find no way to 
select those items addressed to me (+ on index display).  Am I missing 
something?

BTW, please add my name to the list of pine lovers.  You (the development 
team) have done a great job.  I always love seeing public domain stuff 
that's far and away better then the megabuck stuff!  How do we go about 
keeping you 'in business?'

I would like to have an alternate pine 3.91 .pinerc file that will allow.. 

 1.) read news from a news server,..
 2.) use the expanded-view-of-folders feature,..
 3.) ignore my incoming email INBOX and other mail folders

In other words, when I startup pine with the alternate pinerc file, it
goes directly into the list of subscribed newsgroups, and, when I use 'L'
to change to another group, it auto expands the new folder display. For
the duration of the session, there is no access to my mail folders, only
to news groups. 

Anybody have any hints on how to do this?

It's also configurable from the "M" menu.  Unfortunately when you change 
the directory [or just about anything else] via the "M" menu you have to 
exit and re-enter TIN for the changes to take effect...

Thanks,

We experimented with something like this for the incoming-folders list for
a while, but decided the overhead was too high at this time to make it
practical.  We will reconsider it in the future when we have more
efficient mechanisms in the low-level (c-client) code...

Just to try to clarify the current reality:

 o It is true that there are budget cuts going on at the University of 
   Washington, and...
 o It is possible that some of these cuts may impact some aspects
   of the Pine project; 
 o HOWEVER... I don't expect that 3.92 will be the last version of pine.
 o Even so, we still like to get words of encouragement, even the ones
   that end with "but..." :)

	Easier than the Z and D at the end is to press A for apply
followed by D for delete--this will delete all the selected mails at once,
and will be a lot easier if you have selected many mails!

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages. 

------------
Content-Description: What is MIME?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers. 
If you have a Web browser you can access it through:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/mime/top.html

------------
Content-Description: What is IMAP?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733.

Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is bi-directionally
gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.  For official 
          announcements only, you may wish to see pine-announce instead 
          of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with

Content-Description: How many sites use Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

Content-Description: Can we use Pine source code in commercial products?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can we use Pine source code in commercial products?


Pine and C-client source code is copyright by the University of
Washington, however it may be used without fee to the University of
Washington, even for commercial purposes, subject to the terms of the

------------
Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine's cancel/postpone/etc key work?

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

------------
Content-Description: How do I send a message to lots people without showing all the names?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I send a message to lots people without showing all the names?

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon
copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as you
compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default
Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich headers command
(Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose it.

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

Content-Description: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?


Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home
directory called .signature containing the text you want appended to each
message.
   
PC-Pine users should put their signatures in the file \PINE\PINE.SIG.

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail. 
   
For a more detailed treatment of filtering, see the Filtering Mail FAQ and
the Procmail FAQ.  The hypertext version of these are available at:

Content-Description: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I use Pine non-interactively, e.g., in a shell script?

This is not currently possible.  If it were possible you could use Pine,
and your Pine addressbook, to mail people from within a shell script, at 
the end of a pipeline, etc.

Subject: When I get new mail, xbiff lets me know about it, but pine doesn't know about it.

                                       

There are currently two ways to force a new mail check. 
     * Press `Ctrl-L' (Refresh Display). 
     * At the last message in a folder, press 'N' 4-5 times.

Content-Description: How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?

                                       

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description: Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

Content-Description: Why does Pine encode text attachments?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Subject: How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment?
                                       
   
Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at: 
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Content-Description: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows mail

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Content-Description: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Content-Description: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

Content-Description: Can PC-Pine be used with a POP server?

Subject: Can PC-Pine be used with a POP server?

                                       

No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail model
(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,
in a future release.

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Content-Description: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

                                     
In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

Content-Description: How do I make Pine work with my older terminal?

Subject: How do I make Pine work with my older terminal?

                                       

Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

Content-Description: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?
                                       

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Content-Description: To what platforms has Pine been ported?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: To what platforms has Pine been ported?

The Pine distribution includes binaries for AIX 3.2 (on RS/6000), HP/UX
9.0, Linux 1.1, NeXTStep (on NeXT hardware), SunOS 4.1 (on SPARCStations),
Solaris 2.2, Ultrix 4.1 and 4.2 (on DECStations), MS-DOS (PC-Pine) and
MS-Windows (PC-Pine for Windows). 
   
PC-Pine is available for the following TCP/IP stacks: FTP's PC/TCP,
University of Waterloo's WATTCP stack with packet drivers, Novell's LAN
Workplace, Sun's PC/NFS, and Winsock. 
   
Pine has been compiled on other UNIX platforms (4.3 Berkeley UNIX, DEC
OSF/1 V1.2A, Dynix/PTX V1.4.0, VAX Ultrix 4.1, A/UX 3.0, BSD/386 Gamma
4.1, Convex, Dynix 3.0 and 3.1 on Sequent Symmetry, Interactive Systems
Corporation UNIX, Silicon Graphics IRIS with IRIX 4.0.1, SCO Unix, System
V release 4) as well.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Pine 3.89 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.3 crashes every time I try to open a folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not
correctly compile certain constructs used in Pine 3.89 and earlier. We
think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support.. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why should I use the builtin Bug Report command?

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that 
the problem is specific to that message.

When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point that
a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce
the problem in the current version, our standard response will be to ask
you to upgrade.

Subject: What new features will future releases of Pine include?

The list for 3.92 is not frozen yet.  This release will have a number of
bug fixes, but it will also introduce several new features.  Some of
the things we know will be there include:

 o Fix for some pine.conf variables not working (e.g. local bug address).
 o Delete flag will no longer be preserved on Save.
 o Bky mbox format performance bug fixed.
 o Reply prompt will change if there is a Newsgroups header present.
 o Improvements in software flow-control handling.
 o Improvements in bug report command.
 o Ability to specify an alternative to the sendmail MTA.
 o Support for negotiating 8BITMIME with an ESMTP server.
 o Mouse support for use with X terminals.
 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

This reply originated from Pine 3.90 running under SunOS 5.3/Solaris 2.3. 
You should see a FQDN (mail.bcpl.lib.md.us) in the "From:" field, unless I
miss my guess.  Why would it work correctly here but not at
sparc.nic.bc.ca (from which the message to which you were replying to 
originated)?

Comes here Mr. Bob Byers with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this
article on Tue, 17 Jan 1995 12:52:17 -0500:

 +   I would like to have an alternate pine 3.91 .pinerc file that will allow.. 

 +    1.) read news from a news server,..
 +    2.) use the expanded-view-of-folders feature,..
 +    3.) ignore my incoming email INBOX and other mail folders

First make a copy of the current .pinerc to say .pinefornewsrc
Then invoke pine with the duplicate copy of the pine config file with -p flag
(% pine -p .pinefornewsrc)

Go to the Setup/Config screen and then modify the following options to:

inbox-path = <Empty Value>           /* Add value and hit Return immediately */

nntp-server = netnews.at.your.site   /* Add the netnews server address here */

initial-keystroke-list = l,n,v,v     /* List, Next, View, View */


And this feature-list

[ ] - expanded-view-of-folders       /* Leave it unchecked */

Exit and Quit out of Pine. Restart Pine again with this config file and you
will be led into the first newsgroup in your .newsrc file. When once read hit
the tabkey to go to the next group automatically. Hit y to read or n to skip
to the next group that you would like to read. You don't need to go into List
folder screen at all if you have checked the news-read-in-newsrc-order option.

Hope this helps.

I understand how to customize my headers in terms of display when I 
compose a message.  But I am confused on how to setup (require) a receipt 
when a message is read by the receiver.

Thanks in advance.

You should have a directory in your home directory called Mail (or mail).

	I think that if you check the auto-move-read-msgs option under
Settings/Config that it should quit asking you this question. The help for
that option is shown below (as appears in pine 3.91). I think you can 
probably also get to this by editing you .pinerc, if you prefer.


                      		  Ian




                     FEATURE: auto-move-read-msgs 

This feature controls an aspect of Pine's behavior upon quitting.  If set,
and the "read-message-folder" variable is also set, then Pine will
automatically transfer all read messages to the designated folder and mark
them as deleted in the INBOX.  Messages in the INBOX marked with an "N" 
(meaning New, or unseen) are not affected.  <End of help on this topic>

	Pine builds with ease for Solaris 2.x

	You will need to add -Dconst= to the CFLAGS in makefile.sol....and
then simply type "build sol".

	A note of caution....make sure that SPARCWorks/SUNWspro/bin is in
your PATH prior to /usr/ucb and do not have /usr/ucbinclude in your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

can't be typed in every time. Is there any other solution not using pine for a

We've just installed Pine 3.91 SOL (replacing 3.90 SOL) and there are a 
couple of odd things I can't figure out:
 
(1) Ctrl-Space does not advance the cursor one full word like it is
supposed to.  In 3.91 it does nothing.  In 3.90 it inserted a space.  I
use 3.90 and 3.91 under Xenix on an old account that I still have, and
Ctrl-Space works perfectly there.  Should I be looking for a problem in
Pine, or in some system configuration? 
 
(2) If the user's TERM variable is set to vt100, the reverse video
displayed by Pine and Pico appears to be boldfaced as well, making it very
clunky and difficult to read.  If the TERM variable is reset to vt102, the
reversee video is crisp and clear.  Again, this is not what I was used to
under Xenix.  Pine problem or system problem?

Howdy!  I'm looking for a useful way to archive my folders (by putting
them on my pc), while leaving the opportunity to view them (in pine folder
format) in the future.  My concern is not with space on either the unix 
or pc, but with being able to read them on the pc at a later date.

Is there a standalone reader for pine folders?

Thanks,
Bob

Namely, one's that I pick out of my address book.

	Why not make use of your aliases file?  On some systems this is in
/usr/lib and on other is /etc/mail.  You can put in a line similar to:

tp.all: :include:/usr/spool/lists/alltps

	Then, in the file /usr/spool/lists/alltps put your list of addresses.

	You will need to run "newaliases" ... and then you can send to 
tp.all and out it goes....to the list....

or for the complete distribution of all versions, you can try

	ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/packages/mail/pine

I edited all makesfiles and replaced the compiler-flags "-g -O" with
"-fomit-frame-pointer -O2" and the linux-binary is only 877572 bytes
(after stripping it). I didn't remove any of the drivers!

Subject: Alias expander for pine addressbook?
Date: 18 Jan 95 12:52:02 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.790433522@gmi.edu>

As someone who prefers to use pine as my MUA and nn as my reader, I would
like to be able to have the pine aliases available to me from inside nn.  nn
seems to be able to use an external alias expander, and people have even
re-written aux (the nn posting/mailing script) to use elm aliases, or to use
elm as the mailer.  While elm can be used as a mailer at the UNIX prompt,
pine does not seem to support this mode.  

I think I would be satisfied to simply be able to use ~/.addressbook to
expand pine aliases.  I thought it would be a simple hack with cut or awk in
a shell script, resetting the field separation character to TAB.  However
the entries do not appear one per line in the .addressbook.  By quickly
reading the code for handling the addressbook, I think there are 4 TAB
separated fields per entry, with CR having no significance.  This is
difficult to handle with cut and I cannot figure how to get a native nawk
script to open a file other than stdin or one given on the commandline.  I
could probably write the nawk code in a code file, call nawk from a
shellscript with an input file and nawk code file and get it done that way,
but that would be two pieces to maintain, while I really want to keep this
to one piece other than ~/.addressbook.

I have thought about "borrowing" the pieces to do this from pine putting
them together into a C program, but this is turning into more trouble than I
have time for.

Has anyone written a simple alias handler that will take as an arg or on
stdin the alias and spit out the mail address on the stdout?

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages. 

------------
Content-Description: What is MIME?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers. 
If you have a Web browser you can access it through:

http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/mime/top.html

------------
Content-Description: What is IMAP?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733. 

------------
Content-Description: How can I get a copy of Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How can I get a copy of Pine?

Pine is available via anonymous ftp from the pine directory of
ftp.cac.washington.edu. 

------------
Content-Description: What documentation is available?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What documentation is available?

The Pine program itself includes extensive online help.  Additional
documentation may be found via anonymous FTP or via World-Wide-Web at the
following locations: 

  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs
  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

The following contributed documentation is also available:

Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is bi-directionally
gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,

Subject: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine's cancel/postpone/etc key work?

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon
copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as you
compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default
Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich headers command
(Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose it.

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail.

the Procmail FAQ.  The hypertext version of these are available at:

Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

Subject: How can I read a ROT13 encoded message?

                                       

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description: Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Subject: How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment?
                                       
   
Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at: 
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack

Subject: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Content-Description: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows mail
to MIME. Body parts currently supported are: text, gif, Sun rasterfile
(converted to image/gif), postscript, and audio. Other types default to
application/octet-stream. It's easy to extend the set of types supported
and to add conversions, if necessary. 
   
The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the
"convert" program from ImageMagick. If you don't have ImageMagick you can
probably substitute the pbm stuff with little fuss. 

If you are reading this with a MIME browser, the the script and program

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Content-Description: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: Pine 3.89 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.3 crashes every time I try to open a folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not
correctly compile certain constructs used in Pine 3.89 and earlier. We
think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support.. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why should I use the builtin Bug Report command?

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that 
the problem is specific to that message.

When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point that
a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce
the problem in the current version, our standard response will be to ask
you to upgrade.

We don't know right now.  3.92 is under active development, but no dates

Subject: What new features will future releases of Pine include?

The list for 3.92 is not frozen yet.  This release will have a number of
bug fixes, but it will also introduce several new features.  Some of
the things we know will be there include:

 o Fix for some pine.conf variables not working (e.g. local bug address).
 o Delete flag will no longer be preserved on Save.
 o Bky mbox format performance bug fixed.
 o Reply prompt will change if there is a Newsgroups header present.
 o Improvements in software flow-control handling.
 o Improvements in bug report command.
 o Ability to specify an alternative to the sendmail MTA.
 o Support for negotiating 8BITMIME with an ESMTP server.
 o Mouse support for use with X terminals.
 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

Message-Id: <3eib1h$cd3@news.asu.edu>

I am using Pine 3.91 (a newby to the net) and am having problems getting 
my printer to work with it. The printer worked fine with the previous 
version of Pine.  I am using an IBM Compatable, 486DX, 8 meg of ram, 
TCP/IP, trumpet telnet.  The modem is a Practical Peripheral 28.8.  I use 
a PPP connection to a SPARCSERVER 1000 running Solaris 2.3.  While in 
Pine, when I type "y" for print, a message "Caption Onsing" appears in the 
lower right hand corner of the screen, and everything is dumped to my 
hard disk.  I have read through all the Pine FAQs and can't come up with 
anything that closely matches my problem.  The printer is a Panasonic 
KX-P2123 which emulates an IBM Proprinter X24E.  It is a 24-pin.  Of 
course after things are dumped into the hard disk, I can then print it 
out fine, but it is an inconvenience, and I'm not too pleased about 
something just dumping to the hard disk without my control.  Under the 
Pine printer options, I have selected the "ansi" selection.  Requesting 
help within the Pine program doesn't give me mush, just tells me to make 
a selection.  I work within both MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.1 and the 
problem is the same under both platforms.  The printer works fine on-line 
with everything else; i.e., netscape, HGopher, etc.
     I would greatly appreciate any information.  Thank you. - JB

Hiya Peeps,

I didn't receive much of a reply when I tried this before, so here goes again.
Though I am extremely pleased with Pine, here's a couple of questions /
suggestions:

    1. Can I turn off reverse video _completely_? That is, not only for
    selected articles or mails (I've figured that one out), but also for e.g.
    the main menu?

    I'd much prefer underlining.. even "man" can do that! So here's a
    suggestion: make two configurable settings, "start standout" and "end
    standout". Could be configured as start/end boldface, but also as other
    stuff! E.g., under an xterm I could then define standout text to be
    colored.

    2. Pine insists on VT100 codes for function keys, which is definitely
    wrong behavior. I compiled pine with /etc/termcap support, which to my
    knowledge means that Pine should check that file and match incoming keys
    to symbols. E.g., if my /etc/termcap says that :k1 is ^[[12~, then Pine
    should convert escape, [, 1, 2, and a tilde to a symbolic code for F1.
    That's how /etc/termcap works.. Same argument goes for arrow keys.

    3. Some of nn's behavior for news reading is extremely useful, e.g. the X
    key to mark an entire group as "read" and skip to the next one. I'd love
    that in Pine! Any suggestions on how to emulate this?

    4. I got my nn configured in such a way that only the _subjects_ of
    articles are retrieved. When I actually want to _read_ the article, the
    body is retrieved. This saves masses of network traffic.

    How do I get Pine to act in this way ?!

Thanks for listening.. any suggestions are welcome.

   If there isn't a FAQ I'm specifically looking for info on PINE

I don't see any warning flash up for any time at all.  Still I agree
that it should pause and wait for the user to acknowledge the error
before carrying on.  Some people don't notice brief messages.

In pine3.91/pine/osdep/sendmail in append_mesage2() the following code
tests for an error writing the message to be sent:

>     if(!rv){
>         save_errno = errno;

>         q_status_message2(1, 2, 4, "\007Error \"%s\" writing \"%s\"",

>         dprint(1, (debugfile, "Error writing %s: %s\n",
>                    filename, error_description(save_errno)));
>         return(-1);
>     }
> 

Thus I should have had a log of an error in the .pinedebug file but I
saw none.

I have spotted one bug in this area in that no checks are performed on
the return code from fclose().  If (for eg.) you are sending a message
short enough to fit in the stdio buffers or are talking accross NFS
(as I was in my test) then it may well fail horribly.

A quick grep through the pine 3.91 sources suggest that there are lots
of other places where the results of fclose() are ignored possibly
leading to similar problems.

Would a simple fix like:

  rv |= fclose(folder_stream) ;

be suitable in this case?  What about all the other fcloses?

Is there a member of the Pine development team who can comment on
this?

Pine for Windows, which is both a mailer and newsreader and works over
SLIP/PPP, has this.  You press the * key to flag a message.

Pine also does both of these.  

Unfortuantely, when I've used Pine over a PPP connection to read
news, it's been excruciatingly slow.  Is there anyone who uses Pine 
for Windows over SLIP/PPP for newsreading, who's happy with the speed?
Just curious.

Thanks,

Subject: Attaching binaries to mail in Pine
Date: 18 Jan 1995 18:22:21 GMT
Message-Id: <3fjm8t$oml@maze.dpo.uab.edu>

I need to attach binary files to e-mail when communicating with
an individual who is using Pine to read mail on a Unix system.

I do not use Pine and the person that I need to communicate with
does not know more than the basics of Pine use.

My e-mail software (Pegasus Windows on a Novell system) will
attach a binary file to e-mail after uuencoding it.  Pegasus
will automatically uudecode a received uuencoded binary.
Apparently Pegasus also supports MIME decoding of received
encoded binaries.

What format does Pine use to encode transmitted binaries?

Is Pine capable of using uuencode and uudecode?

Is there a on-line manual for Pine somewhere on the internet?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

Innosoft's PMDF is a commerical product which does MIME to cc:Mail (and
other PC mailers like WPO aka Groupwise, Microsoft Mail (PC), and MHS
based mailers). PMDF can talk to SMTP, X.400, FAX and pagers among its many
capabilities. A VMS port of Pine is also available as part of PMDF. 

PMDF is available on VMS systems, and is field testing on DEC's OSF/1 system.

We thought it did already... if you have evidence to the contrary, please

Nancy,
Note that flagging a message as "important" is beyond the design goals of 
NNTP, so the flag will not persist across sessions for *news* messages,
only messages in local or IMAP mailboxes.  However, the "Pine theory of 
newsreading" is that news articles of no further interest get marked as 
Deleted and become invisible in the next session, thus leaving only the 
messages that you might want to go back and look at again.

Re: PC-Pine newsreading performance... We are looking into this.
I've noticed the same thing.

Is it possible to set up PINE so that if you reply to a news article it will
automatically Cc the message to the sender?  In a related question, is it
possible to tell if a message was sent to a newsgroup or directly to you?
I've gotten messages that ask, "Do you want to post followup to newsgroups?"
but the thing to which I'm replying wasn't posted there - it was sent directly
to me but contained the newsgroup reference.

Personally, if ity wasn't sent to the newgroup, I don't think PINE should ask
this, and that it should automatically Cc a posted message to the sender, or
at least have the option of doing so.  How's this sound?

A more detailed reading of all the occurances of fclose() in the pine
source <sigh> has led me to believe that most of the other unchecked
ones are either cases where the file was only opened for reading or we
really don't care if it succeeded or not (like the debug log).  Thus
I'd offer the following patch(let) to osdep/sendmail which I believe
fixes this particular buglet.  I'm still waiting for the build to

On a different matter can someone tell me what the modal argument to
q_status_message() (in status.c) is for?  The code seems to ignore it
completely.

I'd hoped it might wait for a user acknowlegment but it isn't passed
on to anything else.  Maybe this is for a later version (I hope.)

Just in case people think I'm just complaining, I actually like
pine3.91 a lot.  It is the mailer we currently suggest to our new
users and seems to have a much faster learning cycle than most of the
other mailers we have used.  I just hope to iron out a few niggles so
that our users don't have mail vanish.

I'm not very familiar with nn but pine can be used from the UNIX prompt.

% pine address

will put you into the composer with address filled-in in the To field 
(and expanded from addrbook).  I don't know of any stand-alone pine alias

	Since pine is a MIME compliant UA it sticks to the standards and
uses base64 encoding its attachments.

> Is Pine capable of using uuencode and uudecode?

	Yes, but not fully integrated.

	If you receive an email with data that has been uuencoded you can
(within pine) pipe the message to uudecode.

	If you wish to send an email with a uuencoded file, you can uuencode
the file prior to entering pine (or you can ctrl-z and suspend pine) and then
"read" it in to the body of the message from the editor.

It depends on your newsreader and how it saves articles.  You can
try using Pine on your folder by typing this at the Unix prompt:

  pine -if /full/path/to/folder/foldername

Good luck,

hi all,

	is there anyway to configure pine to automatically expunge mails 
once they have been saved or deleted?  i know of the 
expunge-without-confirm feature, but what i'd like is to have the 
"D"elete key do the work of both deleting and expunging AS WELL AS having 
pine look out for any "D"eletes that arise when mail is saved to another 
directory.

	thanks for any help, i really appreciate this.

Nick :)

Subject: Reading folders on Unix w/PCPine
Date: Wed, 18 Jan 1995 12:38:05 -0800
Message-Id: <gweil-1801951238050001@macindeo.jf.intel.com>

I have been trying to set my folder collection so that I can read and
write to the folders created by Pine, on Unix, on my PC using PCPINE.

I set the folder-collections={mumble.mumble}mail/[]. This does not work.
It will show any folders that are in my ~mail directory. 

Can anybody help?

You really want to work without a net!

There is no way to have "D" imply immediate expunge.

Regarding the preservation of the "Deleted" flag when you Save a message:
we agree that this is a misfeature, and it will be corrected in 3.92.

Is it a postscript printer?  If so, set your print driver to something
like:

   HP Laserjet 4/4M on LPT1

Rather than:

   HP Laserjet Postscript 4/4M on LPT1

Hope this helps,

This is how I chose to do it.
It works for me.
Are you sure IMAP i running on the server?

Eeek I'm really getting old or stupid.  I missed that the return code
being tested for in append_message2() was if rv == 0.

Here is a patch which I've verified works at least on SunOS4, and logs
and error to the debugfile if this happens.

Is there any way that I can save messages(mails) from a certain person to 
a certain folder.

I'd like to do this because I subscribe to some mailinglists, and mails 
from other persons than the mailinglist tends to get lost in all the 
other messages.

So, if you have a solution to my problem, please e-mail me.
(I'll try not to loose your mail. :-)

Thanks in advance!

Don't know what I did, but somehow I disabled the automatic monthly

stuff in it and it doesn't prompt me for a new folder at the end of the 
month!  YIPES.  Do you know how to return to the original arrangement?

Hi,

I'm convert from elm over to pine recently, and I have a question about
the .signature file on my replies.  When I try to reply to any mail message
and I copy the text from the first note, Pine will always start off with
my signature first, and then below that it will put the quoted text.  Does
anyone else have this problem?  Is there a switch somewhere in the setup
or the .pinerc file that will fix this?

Thanks,

The reference is to the Post Office Protocol. There are at least 2 versions
POP2 and POP3 that are around. The protocols(s) are covered by RFC's, the
specific numbers I don't recall. The InterNIC has a gopher that will
search for words in the text of the RCF's. You might try that method to
find the corresponding RFC's for POP.

: Sorry for the long quoting, but I couldn't figure out what wasn't important.

: I sent myself a cc:Mail to internet message a few hours ago.  The attached
: file was a wordperfect file.  Pine got it and the note attached to the

: attachment.  I've sent many things via Pine to my office and found that 
: zip files were recognized and handled by cc:Mail properly but everything 
: else comes out MIMEd.

: When I was using elm, I often sent uuencoded files to my office and they 
: were converted (uudecoded) into zip files when they landed in my cc:Mail box.

What software are you using for your cc:mail <--> Internet mail gateway?

	Yes, you can assume that.  However, I've noticed that there is
often a delay between the time people post to comp.mail.pine and it
showing up on pine-info.  Today a piece written on Jan. 6th showed up
in the mail.....

Subject: Abort signal
Date: 19 Jan 1995 23:17:24 -0800
Message-Id: <3fno24$38e@almaak.usc.edu>

I asked a new listserv to send me mail in digest format.  When I received 
the message the index indicated that it was 43,810 characters.  When I 
opened the file I received a blank screen with a note 
"Parts/Attachments"; at the bottom of the blank screen it said "All of 
message text."  I tried to View the attachments, but the attachment index 
had nothing on it.  When I press [V]iew anyway pine quick with the 
message "But in Pine detected:  'Received abort signal.'  Exiting pine."  
So, what the heck is the problem with the message I received, and why 
can't I get access to it?  Thanks in advance.

Message-Id: <3fmv6r$86n@kaiwan009.kaiwan.com>

I got a mail from someone with an attachment (supposedly), well, in the 
message, it tells me I need BinHex 4.0 to convert it?!  Where do I find 
BinHex and how do I get this attachment back into file form?

Please help!  Thanks....

If you are use pine v3.91 then from the main menu, press S (setup), C 
(config).  You then move to the feature list and check the signature at 
bottom item.

Hi,

you will find BinHex on the following aFTP servers:

              ftp.demon.co.uk     /simtel20/msdos/mac/binhex13.zip
              micros.hensa.ac.uk  /mirrors/simtel/msdos/mac/binhex13.zip

and some other hosts (Mirrors of SimTel)
Or simply use ArchiePlexForm at:

        http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/archieplexform.html

And now the things you have to do, when you've got BinHex:

   Start Pine (i use Version 3.91...)
   Press 'I' ( for Folder Index of Inbox)
   Select the message
   Press 'V' to View Message
   Press 'V' to view Attachment
   Select the Attachment (there are two or more, one with the original
    mail and one ore more attachments, i hope ;-)
   Press 'S' to save the attachment _without_ the rest of the mail
   I hope you will find the saved attachment in your actual directory
   or your Home directory

Use BinHex on a PC to extract the original file from the
binhex'ed file you have previously extracted.

Hope it will help,

Bye

FWIW, if you set
	
	nntp-server=$NNTPSERVER

and leave news-collections blank, Pine 3.91 will assume a default
news-collection.  Note that the "News/[]" in your example above is only
the nickname for the collection and does not have any other significance.

"Mail/[]" in the above example is only specifying a nickname and does not
have anything to do with the ~/Mail directory.  You have specified a
folder collection called "Mail/[]" that resides in the ~/News directory...

You can have as many folder collections as you want in Pine, but the first
one listed is the default for saves from any collection.

	Yep indeedy! You have to uncomment the following line in
pine/osdep/os-xxx.h: 

/* #define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM  /* comment out to not allow changing From */

Then you should be able to change your From address. However, I've never
tried doing it via the Customized-hdrs...

Please use the Pine bug report command (B on the Main Menu) and say Yes 
when it asks you if you want to attach the problem message.

Thanks.

Is there such an option available on pine to get "return receipt", i.e. 
after sending someone e-mail to recieve a message, etc., after the person 
has read that particular piece of e-mail?

Thanks,
Kris

Thanks a lot for the location of binhex.  I was looking in
/msdos/decode and couldn't find anything there!  However, after
decoding the file, I got a binary file called Picture_1 which
supposedly was scanned with hyperscan on a Mac.  Any ideas on how
to read this picture?  (I'm on a PC)

Thanks again for the help!

Well, I've posted this question a couple of times on comp.mail.pine
with no response.  Perhaps this will be my lucky day!

I'm truly in need of help.  I want to use the packet version of
PC Pine 3.91 (or 3.90) to connect via a SLIP connection to my school's
mail/news system.  I am using the Univ. of Minnesota's UMSLIP.COM
Packet driver for SLIP, version 2.1 and PHONE.EXE to dial into
my school's slip server.  Gopher, Minuet and DosLynx are working
great.  Whenever I try to run Pine, I get an error message stating
that BOOTP failed.  When I manually enter my IP address, gateway,
nameserver, etc., Pine returns a message stating that my INBOX cannot
be opened because the [Host cannot be found].

I can successfully run the packet version of PC Pine with the Crynwr
Packet driver for a 3c509 NIC, version 11.2.  I do not use BOOTP
when I use the Crynwr 3c509 packet driver.

Any thoughts as to what the problem is?

	I *think* I've found a bug in this. I'm running Pine on a DEC OSF
system, and if I hit 'N' to go over a post/posts (I want to keep it/them
so that it/they appear in the index next time) and then delete posts after
this one, the next time I go into that news group, these posts do *not*
appear, although they remain marked unread in my .newsrc file (e.g.
comp.mail.pine: 1-3242,3244,3246-3247). If, however, I go to the news
group by using the 'G' command, then they *do* show up in the index! 

	If you have any ideas about this, I'd be glad to know why it
happens (and if there's anything I can do about it)! If not, then maybe
the Pine Team can check it out (though maybe not on an OSF system... does
this happen on other platforms?). 

	Thanks, Pine People (especially the Pine Team--you do a great
job)!

Subject: [Q] How can I include video attachments (.mpeg) ?

I didn't find any answer in the FAQ's nor in documentations at
http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/pine/

therefore i ask here.

I want to know if and when how it's possible to include video animations
in a normal email message with pine and have a look on them later on from 
pine via external viewer.

When I try so have a look on the attachment it's impossible in Pine!
Images will be shown via the image-viewer configuration in .pinerc or
my .mailcap but .mpegs aren't recogneized. It looks like that they 
are mime-coded as application and not as video.

Here an extract from my .mailcap:

# This maps MPEG video data to the viewer 'mpeg_play'.
# (Mpeg_play is part of the MPEG distribution from The Berkeley Plateau
# Research Group and is available via anonymous ftp from toe.cs.berkeley.edu.)
video/mpeg; mpeg_play %s ; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# Type octet-stream (binary) data can be displayed as a hex dump before
# you decide whether or not you want to save it to a file.  (Hd is just
# a standard hex dump program.  You could use "od" if you don't have an
# "hd".  Naive users may find the output from this entry confusing.)
application/octet-stream; hd; copiousoutput; description="Hex dump of data"

There is no global mailcap only my personal here! And the global pine.conf
looks like the personal (the viewers obviously)

INcluding postscript-files or images works really fine. When i want to 
have a look on the attachments the external viewer (ghostview or xv) will
be opened automatically from pine. So far so good, but why don't work my 
animations?

I don't read ths conference regularly, therefore please post answers to my
email address, too! 

Thanks a lot!

Kris, I may be too new to know that this is not an answer, but I put my 
email address in the cc. when I mail. IfI get a copy of my message, it 
went out and probably was received. Too simple???

	Yes, too simple.....and too assuming.

	If you cc: yourself the message to you only "loops" within the
system that you are using.  It only means you received it.

	There is a *non-standard* way to "request" delivery report.  That 
way is to create a custom header like "Return-Receipt-To: your@addres.com"
If the MTA at the receiving end supports this....chances are you will get
a "delivery report".  

	The "read receipt" generally implemented at the UA.  At this point
it is totally non-standard.  Some UAs implement their own proprietary methods
for "read receipt".

	Be advised that there is work currently going on to standardize 
various types of "notifications."

    I am currently using Pine on a FreeNet, which has no Slip or PPP

mail, then upload it back to my Mail directory and have pine send the
newly writtn mail?  Any ideas?  I'd appreciate anyone emailing me with
their suggestions.

I am in the process of installing Pine 3.91 on our Sun systems as well as the PC network
using windows.  I *think* the software has been installed correctly on the sun's as I am
able to read/send mail without any problems...
The PC's for some reason are not working...when I try to run pine from one of the PC's, the
INBOX does not get opened...I am aware that the pinerc has to be changed...I am not sure as
to what entry I need to put for the INBOX...
our server name: fennel.cs.hamptonu.edu
smtp-server: fennel.cs.hamptonu.edu
imap server: fennel.cs.hamptonu.edu

this is the entry in the pinerc file currently: inbox-path=/var/spool/mail/$USER  (SUN'S)
PC's: inbox-path={fennel.cs.hamptonu.edu}/var/spool/mail --- I know this entry is incorrect..

Any help will be greatly appreciated..... PLEASE EMAIL DIRECTLY TO ME AT:
tm@cs.hamptonu.edu

As soon as I read Ed Gresshko's latest message on handling return 
receipts within PINE, I wanted to try it.  Below is the message that I 
received (as a receipt).  The sender is the mailer-daemon, not the 
purpose who reads the message.

What I was hoping for was that the receipt would appear to have come from 
the message reader, not the mailer-daemon.

Any suggestions?  This is a big (but not major) issue for some of my PINE 
users.

TIA.

We currently are successfully using Pine on our Unix platforms.  We
want to develop an additional method of reading email using PC-Pine
from within MS Windows using IMAP and NFS.  The PC Pine method will be
primarily for use in student labs.  We want to be able to use IMAP to
read the INBOX and folders and use NFS to access the address books and
signature files on the Unix systems.  At this time we have the IMAP
part working.

I am looking for any configuration information, product names, tips of
any nature from people who have successfully done the NFS part.

Thank you.

Message-Id: <1732D14368S86.FLAVELL@cernvm.cern.ch>
Date: Sat, 21 Jan 1995 22:59:52 GMT

Is there a better place for discussing the HUJI port of VMS Pine?
I see some discussions here (and some where it is not clear whether
the HUJI port is meant, or the one associated with PMDF), but
perhaps there is a mailing list specifically for this package?
 
I am just starting to investigate the HUJI port.  I acquired
PINE_3_91_BETA_3.ZIP to our VMS system, which uses Multinet, and
built it with the Multinet option.  Everything seemed to go well.
 
Problem I am having is that whenever I try to compose a message,
it asks if I want to continue the postponed one.  If I say no, it
works OK.  If I say yes or take the default, it crashes.  The
README.VMS _says_ that "messages cannot be postponed".
 
What makes it think I have a postponed mail?
 
Also, can someone explain just what it means under 1. in "Restrictions"?
It says "the user must not switch to another folder as long as NEWMAIL
has items".  Does something terrible happen?

Subject: Cyrus IMAP/IMSP vs C-Client
Date: 20 Jan 1995 21:23:46 GMT
Message-Id: <3fp9l2$t2t@news.utdallas.edu>

I'm running an old C-client IMAP server (3.0).  I need IMSP for addressbook
capability in ECSMail.  I've tried to apply the patches to IMAP 3.3 and
3.6BETA for Kerberos, IMSP-API, and IMSP.  To say the least, I had
multiple problems taking that approach.

Then I turned around and looked at Cyrus IMAP/IMSP.  I was disappointed
to find that Cyrus IMAPD can't use C-client IMAP because all I wanted
was the addressbook feature.  I've had bad luck with Cyrus IMAPD compiling
to as follows:

gcc -c -I. -I. -I./../lib -I./../et  -I/usr/local/include -DHAVE_LONG_FILE_NAMES=1 -DHAVE_UNISTD_H=1 -DDIRENT=1 -DSETPROCTITLE=1 -DHAVE_MMAP=1 -g cyradmapp.c
cyradmapp.c: In function `Tcl_AppInit':
cyradmapp.c:45: too few arguments to function `Tcl_Eval'
cyradmapp.c:49: `tcl_RcFileName' undeclared (first use this function)
cyradmapp.c:49: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
cyradmapp.c:49: for each function it appears in.)
cyradmapp.c: In function `fatal':
cyradmapp.c:56: `stderr' undeclared (first use this function)

Anyway, I am wondering if anybody has the c-client IMAP and IMSP bundled
together into a single package that can compile on SunOS 4.1.3 or
Solaris 2.  Also, I am wondering what whether I should stay with c-client IMAP
or switch to Cyrus.

Oh well, if this doesn't pan out, it's time to do my X.500 server which I
have to do eventually anyway.

I'm not quite sure about the syntax there, but it basically changes
the ='s in the elm address book to the space (or tabs) required by
pine.

Comes here Mr. Frank Yao with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in this
article on Tue, 10 Jan 1995 09:55:54 GMT:

See I'm not sure that's gonna work as .addressbook is kinda uniquely formatted.
I haven't tried this but if you have a file which is tab separated in this way

first column: nickname
second column: Full Name
third column: complete e-mail address

and each column separated by a tab and then if you cat that file to .addressbook
it might work. Before you try this make sure you make a backup copy of your
.addressbook and .addressbook.lu files.

In Pine 3.91 which was what you are using, you can import a list of addressess
into a new/existing addressbook list. Great Job, kudos to Pine Team!!

And to your second question just send your .addressbook file to whoever you
want it to be sent. Ofcourse I wouldn't include personal address nicknames in
that case.

 +   In the index screen, we get a flag (N,D,A etc), the sender, the size
 +   and the subject.  What exactly is that size indicating, and is there a
 +   way to change it to reflect the number of LINES in the mail message?

The SIZE of each indivual mail in bytes. Number of lines?
If you find out..post it.

Comes here Mr. Ray McAllister with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on Tue, 10 Jan 1995 02:24:02 -0500 (EST):

 +   	Question 1, Please help! How can I access or see what is in my "Home 
 +   Directory"? I cannot seem to find it anywhere on either hard drive, to see
 +   what is in it; to use it, or to delete it. Thanks a million.

/u3/mcallist

That is your "home directory"/"Home Directory"
Here's where you will see all the files that belongs to your account.
/u3/mcallist/mail will be the dir. where you will see all your mail folders.

 +   	Question 2, Where or how can I get a manual for Pine?

ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

 +   	Question 3, When I go into rz to bring a pre-existing file into 
 +   my home directory I sometimes end up with the Procom 2 screen telling me 
 +   Port in use, yet I have hung up. How can I get rid of Port in use and 
 +   continue with Procom and pine without closing everything back to C:?

set port port##

Aah! here you seem to know about home directory.
BTW this modem question really doesn't belong to comp.mail.pine or does it?

	In order to use the BCC feature, first type ^R while the curser is
in the header of the document you wish tosend.  This invokes the "Rich
Header"  feature.  Then, in the line titled BCC, just place all the names
as you normally would in the TO: line. 

	Whenever I do this I usually place a descriptive name in the TO: 
line, just for effect.  To do this, remember to use quotes if it is more 
than one word.  PINE then adds your domain name at the end.  When you 
send the message your original one will come back to you as 
undeliverable, since it was a dummy, though descriptive address.

					Hope this helps,


					Daniel.

You are correct, I could always just export the message I am interested in
and later download them after I quit Pine. I sounds like there is no way
to interactively download a Pine message ala Elm's pipe. The behavior of
Pine's pipe, i.e. pipe to a command and capture the output back into
a viewer, does not seem to be documented in either the man pages or in
Pine's help screens. I thought that something was broken, but now I
understand that the operation of Pine's pipe is a "feature". It would be
nice if in addition to the current operation of Pine's pipe there was an
option to do a pipe without capturing the command's stdout.

Place your cursor at the To: header region and hit Control-R for Rich-Headers.
You will see a Bcc: header, just fill in here the entire list but be told that
there's a limit to how many addressess you can have per header (think itz < 50)

this is not always possible, because you can only get such a thing if the 
recipient's user agent supports read receipts.

Read receipt is a user agent issue, not an MTA (mail transfer agent) issue.
The MTA was nice enough to turn the read receipt into a delivery receipt, 
which is what you get in this case. The MTA does this probably because it 
knows the user agents there does not support read receipt, its other 
alternative is to simply pass it on and you would get nothing if the user 
agent does not support it.

How hard would it be to just have Pine start supporting read receipts?  Once
a major MUA like Pine starts supporting it, other MUAs are bound to jump on
the band-wagon.

Matt,
Many, *many* people consider read-receipts to be an invasion of privacy and 
would refuse to use any tool that "offered" such a facility.  I would not 
look for this feature in Pine anytime soon...

*Delivery* receipts are a different story.

Best bet is to include in your message the words: PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT.

So just have an option (settable from the setup menu) that turns receipts
on.  (ie have it default to off)  This is a feature available on cc:Mail,
and was used extensively where I last worked -- it can be a great help

Terry --

The VMS mail package that we replaced with PINE offered the user the 
option of sending mail messages registered.  If I wanted to send a 
specific mail message registered, I could do that.

I prompted this discussion with how could I send mail messages 
registered.  Is there a simple way to do this within PINE 3.91?

If and when an Internet standard emerges for Read receipt requests and
responses, we would certainly consider such an option... and you can
definitely bank on the fact that the default would be OFF!

Which leaves us with the chicken and the egg problem -- the standard won't
be created until programs support it, and programs won't support it until
there's a standard. That's why I suggested what I did in my first post --
that Pine take the lead, create a standard, and let the world follow.

I had the same problem, so finally gave up and ftp'd the precompiled
binaries pine-bin.solaris, pico-bin.solaris, and imapd-bin.solaris from
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  They work like a charm here, but I was 
simply substituting them for older versions.  Your mileage may vary...

	I tried using the POP capability of 3.91 by specifying my INBOX 
as the POP mailbox, but something is screwy.  Until today (one day of 
use) it worked fine, but when I read my mail today, one message had no 
text, and another message was mangled similarly.  I have no clue as to 
the problem, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I am using a Lynx 125 terminal (in the VT100 emulation mode) to connect 
to an AIX version of pine.  I have a NEC Pinwriter P5XL printer attached 
to the terminal via a parallel port.  While using a similar setup permits 
me to print successfully from a CD-ROM based Medline system at our 
hospital's library, it does not seem to respond properly either to the 
PC or lprint mode of printing from pine.  Without buying a home computer 
and a communication package, is there any way of printing directly in 
this terminal-parallel printer configuration from pine?

Your reply is much appreciated.

It would cause a serious invasion of privacy, so it would ideally
be a user-settable option.

Hi, I just got onto this list.  I'm told there is a general belief
that there's no interest in a Pine port for OS/2.  I'm here to
state that it's more likely that few OS/2 users know about this
newsgroup/mailing-list.

BTW - I picked up on the OS/2 groups that a port of pico is 
available ftp, which I'm using right now to write this message.
It works pretty well.  I'm planning on using it for accessing
UUCP news through my BBS.  Now, I just have to work out extracting
the user name, which shouldn't be too difficult.  Pico will be
ideal for this, since I don't have to worry about [Esc] or
function keys or any of that other junk that DOS & OS/2 programs
seem to rely on.

I also noticed in the docs that Pine was written with NNTP
in mind (please correct me if I read wrong).  Will it work
with UUCP (esp. UUPC from Clarkson)?

We use Winsock Pine at our College. At the moment it's only available for use
by staff although we hope to introduce it onto the Student Open Access PCs
next academic year (there students telnet to the UNIX server and use UNIX
pine). Using PC-NFS or B&W NFS Connect we have a system that dynamically
mounts remote NFS drives (including a user's own server area) according to
username/password validation. This way staff can run Winsock Pine from 
any PC so configured. The binaries (pine.exe etc) are located on the 
local HD but the pinerc and other bits are in the user's remote  N:\PINE.

Getting WinPine to use UNIX versions of news and address --.newsrc and 
.addressbook -- is possible if you use the cookied version of the 
filename in the WinPine pinerc. file. Not a great solution and has its 
dangers but ...

I've done a document (Word 6 format) for users taking them through the 
process of setting a copy of the program up. Mail me if you'd like it 
e-mailed to you.

It would be off by default on our system, I am sure.  As long as
receipts are dependent on the site and even the user, they are close
to meaningless since you would never be sure what to conclude when you
do not get a return receipt

Note also that even a receipt does not mean the message was *read*
which is probably what the sender wants to know.  At best an automatic
reply could tell you whether the message was put on screen, but the
recipient could still blow past it without reading it.

The only reliable method is to ask the recipient to send a reply
acknowledging the message.

Well, so far I've been pointed to ftp.cac.washington.edu, and celestial.com.
Washington doesn't have the compiled binaries for SCO (although they have
most everything else) and celestial.com doesn't seem to exist ...

Surely SOMEONE out there has compiled Pine/pico under SCO???

Jake,

I use PC Pine For Windows over a PPP connection without problems. The most difficult 
step is setting up the inbox address correctly. 

Try ftp'ing ftp.cac.washington.edu and check the /mail/ directory for the latest 
version.

Subject: several Pine suggestions
Date: 23 Jan 1995 17:35:56 GMT
Message-Id: <3g0pds$r9c@hobbes.cc.uga.edu>

I really enjoy using Pine, and I appreciate the work that the authors have
put into developing and supporting it.  Here are a few suggestions for
future releases of Pine that the developers can "take or leave".  Thanks!

1)  In INDEX mode, allow the 'k' and 'j' keys to be used to move the current
    pointer up and down (j key would only function like this if
    jump short cut were turned on).  This convention can be
    found in vi, Elm, Gopher, and other utilities, so it makes things
    somewhat consistent.

2)  When reading a message with the builtin Pine pager, the spacebar
    scrolls the message down one page.  Add a feature such that the
    RETURN key can be used to scroll down one line.  This convention
    is used with the Unix more and less commands, as well as some
    other pagers.

3)  Add a special Quit-type command that will exit Pine without making
    any changes to the current folder.  For example, when this command
    is used, all messages marked for deletion will NOT be deleted, and
    all messages that were marked as new ('N') when the folder was
    opened will still be marked as such when the folder is opened 
    the next time.

4)  Add an option that makes the 'n' (NextMsg) command in the INDEX skip
    over messages marked for deletion.

They're definitely there.  However, frp.celestial.com recently changes 
its IP address, and a lot of sites still don't know about it.  The change 
happened a couple of months ago, but my site (for instance) still finds 
the old address.  I've just looked at the real site, and there are two 
files which you are looking for:

-rw-rw-r--   1 jwc      4217275 Nov 25 11:10 pine-3.91.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r--   1 jwc      1065011 Nov 28 17:47 pine3.91.sco.bins.tar.gz

The first has both source and binaries.  The second, binaries only.

The new information for ftp.celestial.com is that it's an alias for 
camco1.celestial.com, 192.136.111.2.  Go there directly.

celestial.com *does* (or did) exist; I've been on there, but perhaps like 
you, I haven't been able to connect to them recently, and I *really* want 
to!

I did find an old file listing of their's, and it seems it has pine 
binaries in it.  If anyone knows what happenned to celestial.com, please 
tell us!

If you're desparate, I have a binary for SCO 3.2v4.1, if that helps.

By default (new users), Pine will ask if you want messages marked for 
deletion to be removed permanently.

Try the [TAB] key. You might need to set some options in your 
configuration. Basically, it will cause you to jump to the next 
new/unread message.

Happy trails!

Right.  But, I was thinking of something more global, that would allow the
user to exit the folder without marking ANY changes to folder that were made
since the last Expunge.  This would be especially useful for system
administrators who are sometimes called to open user's mail folders when they
complain of a corrupt folder, etc.  In this case, it would be nice to "reset"
the folder so that all new ('N') messages stayed marked that way, even if they
had actually been read.

Yes, I use it regularly.  But, it only goes to the next new/unread
message.  Several new Pine users here have mentioned to me that they 
would like to be able to quickly be able to get to the next message
that has not been marked for deletion.  Maybe that's being too picky, though.

Thanks again.

SysAdmins can start pine with the -o option to cause the first 
mailbox/folder to be openned as read only.

Either way, it's feaping creaturism, I say. I wouldn't say one option is 
any better than the other, so it could be either way for me.

Look at ftp://ftp.digex.net/pub/access/schueman/popper.tar.gz.

This contains source + binaries for a POP3 server. It was compiled under
Solaris 2.3 on a Sparc 10.

Something similar happened to me. Pine reports the right length, but
does not display the message. After I looked in my mailbox with emacs
(or any other text editor, capable of displaying control codes), I saw
a block of 4096 zeroes in the file. 4096=4K and is exactly one virtual
memory page. Pine does not display the rest of the text, probably it
is treating the message as a zero-delimited string by the C convention :-( 
The problem is caused most probably by an incoherency in the NSF
mounting of the mail directory :-(

Comes here Mr. Steve Lowe with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 22 Jan 1995 23:55:04 -0800:

 +   I prompted this discussion with how could I send mail messages 
 +   registered.  Is there a simple way to do this within PINE 3.91?

What do you mean by registered?

 +   > Many, *many* people consider read-receipts to be an invasion of privacy

 +
 +   So just have an option (settable from the setup menu) that turns receipts
 +   on.  (ie have it default to off)  This is a feature available on cc:Mail,
 +   and was used extensively where I last worked -- it can be a great help

We have cc:Mail for inter-office email over a LAN and I (many others) *HATE*
it when someone sends me a mail requesting reciept.

Nowadays mail from "i will always ask for recpt" types don't get read at all.
I just forward them to myself and then read it and if it is worth i will reply
else i will let the sender wonder why I haven't read the "reciept reqd. mail"

Please do not include this feature(or bug i should say) in Pine. I don't want
the system spend precious CPU time sending stupid reciept mail back and forth.

For such extreme cases Return-Receipt-To: works just fine.

Give up.  Most people who have thought about it do not want it, and would
turn off the option anyway.  If it is important for you as a recipient to
let people know you have received it, 'r' and tell them.  If you only want
to know as a sender, then many people consider this to be snooping.

This will become such an nightmare, I may have to set it OFF premanently
in pine.conf.fixed atleast here.

That is when and if at all Pine *does* have that feature.

 +   1)  In INDEX mode, allow the 'k' and 'j' key to be used to move the current
 +       pointer up and down (j key would only function like this if
 +       jump short cut were turned on).  This convention can be

While personally I wouldn't mind using h,j,k&l keys for navigation I can
almost think of all the new users stopping to use Pine if that is implemented
as one of the main reasons why they think VI is eVIl is because if h,j,k&l.

What would be nice is the use of "/" forward slash for Search instead of W,
as most of all the other utilities make use of that.

 +   2)  When reading a message with the builtin Pine pager, the spacebar

While settings in pine.conf can be overridden by the user by making use of

you give a <Empty Value> ("") value for the editor option.

You're absolutely right; it shouldn't a default.  But, they are rather
ubiquitous, and for those of us who are used to using them, it would
be a nice option.

Agreed.  It would be nice if both worked.

The Up and Down Arrow keys do work fine, but when you're used to using
the RETURN key in a bunch of applications, it's awkward when it
doesn't work in another (but of course, I CAN get over this).  User-definable
keys as an advanced feature would be nice too.

Jack,
The fact that setting "no-enable-alternate-editor" in pine.conf.fixed 
fails to have the desired effect is a bug, and it will be fixed in 3.92.

You can filter mail with a separate program, like procmail or filter, 
which may be onn your machine.  Look around for Nancy McGough's excellent 
filtering faq.  I only have a print copy, but it is at her WWW site, 
which you can get from her signature.

Subject: Non-standard INBOX locations and pine
Message-Id: <vzvzD2w73C.1M9@netcom.com>
Date: Tue, 24 Jan 1995 04:28:24 GMT


Recently, I have been trying to setup Pine here at Netcom and have run
into a problem:

Some users are reporting that pine doesn't see their INBOX'es.
The inboxes are located at $HOME/.mailbox/inbox.
This is unlike the unix standard /usr/local/spool/mail/$USER (or whatever).
I searched through the makefile and could not see any reference to this.
I did not want to modify the source code since I might not change the right
things.  So I tried to make a general config file.

I made the file setting "inbox-path=" line to whatever I need.
Then i try to execute the following script:

---
#!/bin/sh
#
# Script to launch pine

exec /u3/vzvz/pub/pine/pine -P /u3/vzvz/pub/pine/pine.conf $*
	
---
This gives me the following:

{The pine main menu screen}
[Opening "INBOX"...]
Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.

I don't understand why this wouldn't work.  Also if someone could help
with what source code I should change.  I am also interested in what
pine looks to to find INBOX.  So far, i have found that if we set
the $MAIL variable it works.  Even though the MAIL thing is OK I would
like to figure out something in the sense of getting a general config file.

Thanks for all your help! and a great product too!

Philip,
You certainly should not need to modify source to change the inbox path!

I would suggest setting the inbox-path entry in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf to:

 inbox-path=.mailbox/inbox

or if you prefer the aesthetics of using $HOME, then use:

 inbox-path=${HOME}/.mailbox/inbox

(The squiggley brackets are needed to delimit the name of the env. var.)

I'm unclear on what you are trying to do in your script, or why it is 
needed in preference to the existing pine.conf facility...

Pine creates those ".pine-debug..." files automatically each time it is 
used.  The most recent is always .pine-debug1, the one previous to that 
.pine-debug2, and so on up to .pine-debug4.  Obviously each time a new 
.pine-debug1 is created, the old 1, 2, & 3 are renamed 2, 3, & 4 and the 
old 4 is deleted.
 
You can suppress the creation of a .pine-debug file by using "pine -d 0"
to start Pine, instead of just "pine", but why bother?  Those files don't
take up much space and can be a useful diagnostic tool if Pine does
something stupid. 
 
I had something strange happen a couple of times back when Pine 3.89 was
the latest and greatest, where the number of .pine-debug files grew to
well over the limit of four.  That was a long time ago and I don't
remember what the total grew to, but it was a lot.  This was supposedly
impossible, but there they were in my home directory.  Anyone else ever
see this?  It hasn't happened to me with 3.90 or 3.91.

Dear Pine Developers,

I have found a bug in PCPINE for Windows (3.91).

When I include a file via CTRL-R and just type the filename (i.e. without 
CTRL-T to get the browser) the CTRL key seems to be locked, but only for 
the SPACE key. 
this meens:
all keys work as they should, but hitting SPACE the function CTRL-SPACE 
is performed. executing any CTRL-... function or just hitting CTRL stops 
this behavior.

I was wondering is it possible to create a mailing list with Pine, where 
everyone in the list can mail? I mean I created a list for our demo group 
with address books command S CreateList... but I don't know how other 
members could mail into it?

We have Pine v.3.87 

I hope someone could help us? Thanks in advance

Is it possible to do a TakeAddr but add the address to a distribution

I find the easies thing to do is assume that it has been read within a
reasonable time after delivery -- just like paper inter-office mail.
I hold them responsible and act accordingly.  It would be a nice safety
feature (for them) if I knew it had/had not been read, but they are
responsible.  It will happen as it seems to be a feature in most pc email
systems.  I'd certainly rather bet my job on email than US Mail.

I admit these files could be useful, but they clutter up my dir listing. 
Is there a way to redirect them to a folder?

Succinct, but not necessarily accurate.  Examples: it's "Internet
*Message* Access Protocol", it was originally developed at Stanford,
and it's not just for Unix servers...

I also disagree with her conclusion that it will have more impact on Unix
users than LAN-based users, even though that is certainly true today. 

Still, it's nice to see that one of the best kept secrets in the email 
world is finally getting some press coverage.

I just thought I would ask my =A30.02 worth (about $0.015 to you Americans =
:-)

I think that return recpeipts in PINE would be bad for a couple of reasons:

1)  This is a quote from the O'Reilly & Associates sendmail book (pg 583)

    The Return-Receipt-To: header should never be declared in the=20
    configuration file, and, in fact, should rarely be used at all.  It
    is not intended as a routine delivery-verification mechanism, but=20
    rather is intended for occasional use in debugging delivery problems.
    It is escpecially dangerous when used in outgoing mailing-list mail,
    because it can cause an avalanche of returned mail, and can possibly
    bring a host to its knees.

As can be seen, the sendmail gurus think that it is a bad idea and they=20
know a thing or two about email !

2) The second problem with return receipt is that a MTA receiving email
will (possibly) automatically send the receipt *without* any user
intervention.  As a there are people in Europe who actually pay for
international email traffic, this function could cost them a lot of money=
=20
which they may not necessarily know about until they get the bill (this=20
obviously depends on how the billing is done)

Just to throw a spanner in the works, however, there is an Internet draft=
=20
called draft-ietf-notary-mime-delivery-04.txt which is titled "An=20
Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications".  Again=20
quoting from the abstract of the draft:

    This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a message=20
    transfer agent (MTA) or electronic mail gateway to report the result
    of an attempt to deliver a message to one or more recipients.

This draft also highlights some security risks with return receipt=20
messages (such as false headers and confidentionality for instance). =20
This is well worth a read and can be ftp'd from ns.internic.net amongst=20
other places. =20

We have the following set in pine.conf.fixed, and it seems to do the job:-

no-enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
no-always-use-alt-editor,
no-enable-alternate-editor-implicitly,

How would I kill all mail that comes from a certain address using
pine itself?  Does pine support killfiles?

Yes, I know I could just make a procmail recipe, but I'd like to
use just pine.

I don't know if this is in the documentation or in a FAQ, but I've found 
a way to crash Pine (I've tried v3.89 and v3.91).

A few users and I were able to crash Pine by simply changing the 
capitalization of the first letter of an address book nickname.  We're 
running SunOS 4.1.3_U1 and 4.1.4.  

Is this a documented thing?

> If you are reading the plain text version (i.e., not the hypertext  
version) of 
> this FAQ it is in RFC1153 digest format which means each subject is  
formatted 
> as a mini mail message with its own Date, From, and Subject (and  
sometimes 
> Followup-To) headers.  Some newsreaders and mailers make it really easy
> to jump to a subject in an article that is in digest format.  Here are 
> instruction for some newsreaders:
> 
> * NN's default is to split a digest and present each digest item on the 
>   menu.  If you have changed the default by putting ``set split off'' in 
>   your ~/.nn/init file then you can split an article that is in digest 
>   format by typing G% while viewing it.  This will present each digest  
item 
>   on a submenu.  You can then read, followup-to, save, print, etc.  
individual 
>   digest items.
> 
> * In trn (and its relatives like rn and strn) you can type ^g to skip to 
>   the next line that begins with ``Subject: ''
> 
> * In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p  
will
>   go back to the previous digest article).
> 
> 
> If your newsreader or mailer does not have a built-in command that  
allows
> you to easily read a digest you can pipe the article to ``formail -ds''
> which will split the article into separate mail messages, and then you  
can

> Subject: ... 2.6 Backfinger Script
> 
> by Janet Rosenbaum
> 
> There is a script available called, among other things, backfinger,
> planner, and finger_logger (flogger or frogger, for short).  This script
> makes your plan into a named pipe (just think of this as a sort of
> pipe used with plumbing that opens out onto the screen of the person who
> is fingering you (fred)) so that when it is accessed, it looks for a
> program from which to get something to stick on fred's screen.
> 
> The script is called when you are fingered.  At that moment, it looks to
> the finger port of your unix machine and sees which machine fred is
> on, logs that machine's IP number and hostname, and the date.  The  
script
> can then execute a command to spit a plan out on fred's screen.  (One
> might get creative and write a program that generates random poetry or
> use the fortune program or just do "cat plan_file".)   To make fred
> think you are really cool, it also tells him what machine he is
> fingering you from.
> 
> Some caveats:
> 
> 	-- This program must be running at all times on your system even
> 	when you are logged out.  Leaving a background process like this
> 	annoys most sys admins to no end, especially on systems with
> 	high load.  Do **not** run the program unless you are sure that
> 	you are allowed to run background processes like this.
> 
> 	-- Also, if you decide you want to stop running this program,
> 	remove your .plan file as soon as you kill the process.  If you
> 	do not do this, all finger processes for you will hang.
> 
> 	-- This script only tells you the machine fred is fingering you
> 	from, not his actual username.  It is nearly impossible to get
> 	this information except at sites with bad security.
> 
> 
> Given the above, I will distribute the script to those who can use it,
> mostly for educational reasons.  I admit that I no longer run the
> program, since my two main accounts are on rather high-load systems.
> Nevertheless, I learned quite a lot from modifying these scripts and

> A: The original genesis of this bit of lore was the NSA's

>    that the NSA scans and archives every message posted to

>    add "spook fodder" to your .signature consisting of words
>    like "conspiracy, bullion, plutonium, Saudi Arabia,
>    president, assassination," and so on.  I think that the GNU

>    A couple of years ago there was a nut named Clayton Cramer
>    who would periodically bombard soc.motss with pages and

>    Libertarian, Reagan," or some such.  It got quite a few

Read receipts are a common enough question among my users that I have a
standard reply.  The hint in the last paragraph is much more reliable
than any automatic mechanism ever will be.  Automated read receipts do
not tell you whether your message was read by the user, only if it was
read by his software.

   There is currently no universal mechanism for getting verification
   of email delivery.  One method that almost works is to include a
   header in your message:

	Return-Receipt-To: username@rahul.net

   IF the recipient's system uses 'sendmail' for mail transport, it
   will send back an automated reply saying it received the message.
   But it doesn't guarantee that it reached the recipient's mailbox,
   only that it reached the recipient's host.

   A requirement to get confirmation of mail actually being read by the
   recipient is that sending and receiving hosts have a common protocol
   for this.  This is not the case on the Internet, as sites are
   autonomous and use a variety of software.  The chances of it
   happening in the future is also small:  many people consider it a
   violation of their privacy.

   The best way to find out if somebody read your mail is to send a
   brief follow-up message saying "Hi, I was just wondering if my
   previous message reached...I can't tell if my email is getting
   out."  This will usually result in a quick reply.

What is happening is at netcom our admins don't update software.
We are still using 3.89!  A group here compiles their own stuff and makes
it work!  I was helping pine users at netcom nget 3.91 but some had
trouble with mail locations...
I think the brackets around HOME solve everything!

Howdy y'all,

Is it possible to somehow have a random signature (out of a directory of
signatures) be selected and pasted into pine?  If not, is there any way
to get pine to run a program that would output such a random sig?

Thanks!

Thanks for the bug report.  I couldn't reproduce it on my machine - but
I do handle CTRL-space as a special case and there may be a bug in that
code.  I'll take a look at it.

Ok ... I finally got pine, and I've been playing around with it, and I 
suddenly realize that the cursor keys on our Wyse60 terminals are not 
working inside Pine ... 

It looks like the cursor keys send ^K, ^J, ^H, and ^L, which Pine uses
for other purposes.  Is there a way to remap these keys inside Pine, or 
do I initialize the terminal to a different type going in??? 

Anybody ever run into this?

You know the problem--you can filter on "from" but not on "reply to".
I'd kill for a good mailing list manager.

Doesn't happen here under SunOS 5.3 and Pine 3.91.

This may not be exactly what you requested, but it works for me.

#! /sbin/sh
mv ${HOME}/.signature ${HOME}/sig1.tmp
mv ${HOME}/.sigb ${HOME}/sig2.tmp
mv ${HOME}/.sigc ${HOME}/sig3.tmp
mv ${HOME}/.sigd ${HOME}/sig4.tmp
mv ${HOME}/.sige ${HOME}/sig5.tmp
mv ${HOME}/sig1.tmp ${HOME}/.sige
mv ${HOME}/sig2.tmp ${HOME}/.signature
mv ${HOME}/sig3.tmp ${HOME}/.sigb
mv ${HOME}/sig4.tmp ${HOME}/.sigc
mv ${HOME}/sig5.tmp ${HOME}/.sigd

This is obviously for 5 sigs, but can be easily changed to work with more
or less

I just have it in my .login, so that I have a different sig each time I
login.

     Hope this helps,
     Matt

O.K.  I figured out how to get around this on my system.  I setup a shell
script that invokes 'tput -T wyse60ak reset' before invoking pine, and 
'tput reset' after invoking pine.  The wyse60ak terminfo has ANSI key 
definitions for the cursor keys.  

Thanks anyway ...

Yup. Pine doesn't use TERMINFO or TERMCAP to get cursor movements :(  

^N for next line,
^P for previous line,
^F to move forward one character,
^B to move backward one character.

Is there a SOFTWARE way of switching TERMINAL modes for a WYSE?  I would 
LOVE to be able to turn it into a vt102, and then back again after 
pine....is this possible?

It would also help with lynx.

Subject: PICO & SPELL checker
Date: 24 Jan 1995 18:29:06 GMT
Message-Id: <3g3gti$d38@news.halcyon.com>

For some time now I've been frustrated by the spell checker in PICO. I 
use a lot of words that are not in SPELL's default dictionary and wanted 
a better way of bypassing these words than pressing the space bar. After 
some digging I've come up with the following. If it's already common 
knowledge pardon the redundancy. If it's not it might make life a bit 
easier. BTW - I tried ISPELL as a substitute for SPELL but found it klunky 
and confusing.

The following works for those who use PICO as their default editor and 
SPELL as their spell checker. I haven't checked this for other editors.

To create a custom dictionary for SPELL:
- Two files will be created in your HOME directory:

  1 - New words; an ascii file - sorted one word per line - caps 
      don't seem to matter (I named mine .newwords).

  2 - New dictionary; a hashed file (I named mine .newhlista).

- From the UNIX prompt key: 
  cat .newwords | spellin /usr/dict/hlista > .newhlista
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  (The above creates a new custom dictionary.)

  cat .newwords | spellout .newhlista
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  (The above compares new words to words in custom dictionary.)

- Edit your .login file to include:
  setenv SPELL 'spell -d .newhlista'
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Logoff & log back into the system to enable changes made to .login 
environment variables. Now when you use the ^T within PICO SPELL will 
check for your custom dictionary as specified in .login file.

Hope this helps,

If you ftp to typhoon.unl.edu:/pub/mgleason, there is a file called 
sigrnd.tgz which does what you want.  You will gunzip to uncompress it.

Pine (3.91) didn't crash on my sun (SUNOS 4.1.3), but I got a message 
stating that "xxx already exist in .addressbook as yyy" (replace xxx with 
the new nickname and yyy with the according fullname). This is quite 
unnecessary, because I know that I changed an entry in the .addressbok 
and therefore I know that thgis entry exists.

Try looking at procmail which can be found at 
ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/packages/procmail.  This package 
allows you to filter on virtually anything which occurs anywhere in a 
message (ie you can filter both the body and the header).

An example of a procmail "program" is

:0:
* ^From.*pine.*
pine

which says (basically)

:0:              --> Take this message and using a local locfile called 
                     pine.lock (the lock filename is the folder name + 
                     .lock) 

* ^From.*pine.*  --> Egrep for From at the start of the line followed by
                     any number of characters, followed by pine, followed
                     by any number of characters

pine		 --> Put any messages which conform to the above search 
                     into the folder called pine, which will be placed (or
                     found under $MAILDIR)

I realise that this is a *very* simple recipe for procmail but it will 
place any incoming messages which contain the word pine in the From line 
into the folder called pine.  Simply add more conditions to refine the 
process.

In addition, procmail comes with a (IMHO) very good set of manual pages - 
try man procmailex to see some examples.

When the session running a Pine process suddenly disappears for whatever
reason, the Pine process apparently starts using CPU time like mad.  Is
there any way to make it realize that I'm not logged on anymore, and to make
it quit nicely so it doesn't drive the load up?  I'm using 3.91.

Is there a procmail listserver at all?

Our procmail handles over 70000 pieces of mail weekly for a centralized 
mail server, but if users use Mosaic or Gopher to a remote site, obtain 
info and try to mail it back, the mail connection opens to our server but 
procmail routinely reports "No such user" and then quotes the exact email 
address between double quotes. This quoted address is indeed a valid 
address despite what procmail says. In the end, the user here does not 
get their Mosaic/Gopher initiated mail.
Ideas?

I've answered this by private mail a lot recently, so a posting is

ftp.celestial.com is now a CNAME (alias) for camco1.celestial.com, which 
is IP address 192.136.111.2

Another place to find my binaries package for Pine 3.91 for SCO is 
odi.cwc.whecn.edu.  They're on the other side of MCI from me, through 
Sprintnet to Westnet.  MCInet recently had a few serious routing 
glitches, so if you've been unable to get to WHECN, you probably can now, 
since MCInet has settled down.

I apologize if this is an FAQ (if it is, please point me to the right place).

We're running Pine 3.91 on the system that contains our news spool files.  
Is there a way to make pine access the news spool directly without initiating
an NNTP connection?

Thanks in advance!

Add 'postponed-folder=""' in pine.conf (global) or .pinerc (sys$login)

That is only applicable if you map INBOX to be NEWMAIL. DO NOT DO THIS.
Nasty things will happen. Leave INBOX = INBOX, ignore it completely, and 
make a few extra keystrokes to open NEWMAIL instead.

How can you force PC-Pine 3.91 to save passwd on disk, so the user 
doesn't have to sign in each time pine is started ?

Thanks in advance

Matt,
Can you make this bug occur on demand?  If so, please get in touch 
with us directly...

Until the bug is squashed, your only choice is the venerable "kill" command.

I have finally gotten around to installing Pine 3.91 (on SunOS 4.1.3_U1) 
and have been using it in a testing situation for myself. I would like to 
replace the 3.07 that my site is using, except that this version of Pine 
is considerably slower in every respect. Is there any way to speed it up, 
or are there plans to do this in the future? I can't in good conscience 
replace the familiar (and reasonably speedy) 3.07 with this new release 
if it's going to slow everyone down, and I don't want to support two 
releases (one for those who want speed, one for those who want all the 
new features).

Also, is there any way to turn off the "Unparseable date" message that 
sometimes comes up when I open my INBOX? I truly don't care two whits if 
someone doesn't know how to configure their Internet gateway to properly 
generate RFC-821/822 email as long as it gets here in one piece.

	I have just compile and config Sendmail8.6.9 for my host which 
run on Solaris2.3. During this two days, I have tested it and I confront 
with the problem that why the Message-ID is error.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.91.950124122131.554A-100000@earth>

This Message-ID is generated by Pine -- it isn't generated by sendmail.

[ I will add comp.mail.pine as receiver. Perhaps Pine folks tell how to solve
  this error. ]

So your test mail don't indicate error in sendmail.

Comes here Mr. Jakob Schlyter with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 24 Jan 1995 11:32:51 GMT:

 +   Is it possible to do a TakeAddr but add the address to a distribution
 +   list instead? If not, this would be a nice function to add (3.92?).

Here's how I do it in 3.91

T L A T nickname A

T - Take Address
L - List Mode
A - Select All
T - Take

Now at the enter nickname prompt, enter the nick of the existing list

A - Add or R for Replace.

Hope this helps.

Well, more likely since it's only since Warp came out that people cared 
:)  Previously, getting online with OS/2 cost a bit more.  But they are 
around now, I'm one of them and would love a pine port.

Have you thought about just changing the file permissions on the .pinerc 
file?  (chmod 700 .pinerc)  Maybe i am just reading what you are after wrong,
but is it that people are just coming in and reconfiguring pine for you?

There're VMS and unix versions of a BinHex converter. I fetched the unix
one from the NYU archives some years ago (ftp.med.nyu.edu).  Works well
both ways.

I use telix to connect to my local university and use pine from that
system.  I have a student who is using the windows terminal software
to connect from home.  I tried it here on my computer to try to
help her learn.

There are a couple of problems we ran into.  It will not let us use
the arrow keys in pine.  And it will not let us use ^C to cancel
a message.

Any suggestions?

Subject: Can your EMAIL system do this?
Date: 25 Jan 1995 19:11:50 GMT
Message-Id: <3g67pm$4s7@newstand.syr.edu>

Hi,

I was wondering if there are any mail systems for UNIX<->PC that have these
features. 

Client/Server

100% Server based. Everything is stored on the server such that I can
access all my mail as well as my saved folders and address books from my
client. Since it is TCP/IP based I can access my mail from any node on the
internet without logging into the mail server directly.

UNIX text/ UNIX X Windows/ PC Windows/OS2/Mac(?) mail clients?

Supports SMTP, Novell, POP and IMAP(?) gateways so that I can use one mail
program to read/save all my EMAIL regardless of it's origin.

Does not depend on shared filesystem access (Novell, MSMAIL PO) so that I can
access my mail remotely using SLIP or dialup/terminal (UNIX text client).

Pegasus Mail for windows is the only program that I've used that allows me
to read both my Novell mail as well as my UNIX mail. However it saves
everything locally on my hard drive (work,ethernet) and so I cannot either
my address book or folders when I'm at home (SLIP).

Such a system as I describe will allow students to read their mail from any
machine without a need to create accounts on Novell servers or provide
remote Novell dialup access.

We are currently using PINE and Pegasus Mail (UNIX,Windows,Mac).

Thanks.

Message-Id: <courcoul-2501951345310001@trantor.qro.itesm.mx>

Is there any way to ease the moderation of Usenet newsgroups, when using Pine ?

As you know, when you are the moderator of a newsgroup, all mail sent to
the group gets forwarded to you, so that you can attach an "Approved:
<your address>" tag in the header and send it back to the server.

So far, what I have done is defined the "Approved" tag via customized
headers, and have to forward the messages, using rich headers so that I
can fill in the newsgroup and leave the To: tag blank.

Is there any trick to simplify this ? Ideally, a sort of "newsbounce"
command that automagically added the missing tag, but kept the original
header as-is, while allowing you to make any desired changes to the body
text would be ideal, but I haven't found it yet amongst Pine's hundreds of
goodies.

Thanks for any pointers.

Comes here Mr. Lee (not F) Bailey with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine"
group in this article on 24 Jan 1995 15:34:15 GMT:

 +   I admit these files could be useful, but they clutter up my dir listing. 
 +   Is there a way to redirect them to a folder?

You should define these in the os-xxx.h file in the osdep dir and re-compile.

        #define DEBUGFILE	    ".pine-debug"

For that option you could perhaps put $HOME/.pinedebug/.pine-debug
or whatever is convienient.

        #define NUMDEBUGFILES 4

You can also re-define the number of debug files pine produces.

But then again, the Pine Team has optimized the code so well, so why bother eh!

Hi!

What I do is run a perl script that writes a random quota to .signature 
before starting pine (actually it writes to stdout but I redirect it to 
.signature).
here's the script:

#!/your/path/to/perl
srand(time ^ $$);
undef $/;
@sigs = split("\n%%\n", <DATA>);
# open(SIG, ">.signature");           
# uncomment above line should it write directly to .signature
print $sigs[rand(@sigs)], "\n";
# above line prints to stdout
# print SIG $sigs[rand(@sigs)], "\n";
# uncomment above line should it write directly to .signature
__END__
--
witty .sig
%%
--
another witty .sig
%%
--
and so on
%%

The sigs are part of the script. I have no experience with perl, but this 
thing works. I have another simple shell script which re-establishes my 
regular sig, this script is called 'regsig'.
I invoke Pine with:
  perl rndsig ; pine ; perl regsig

The original perl script had been posted by somebody either in 
comp.mail.misc or in comp.mail.pine.

Enjoy,

tm

follow up:
sorry, two typos in my recent posting/reply:

  the script doesn't write 'a quota' but a quote to .signature
and
  to use it one should type
    rm -f .signature ; perl rndsig > .signature ; pine ; perl stdsig

(there a lots of other ways, eg. pine can be started with an option to 
read another sig)

Yours,
tm

Subject: Slow screen updates affect one user
Message-Id: <RICK.95Jan25144650@helix.nih.gov>
Date: Wed, 25 Jan 1995 19:46:50 GMT

Of about 2500 users on this SGI, one pine (v3.91) user reports the
following symptoms over a high speed modem connection.  Can anyone
suggest a diagnosis and cure?

   A symptom which is still reliably exhibited in PINE can be done by
   rapidly pressing the down arrow 5 times.  At best, I get all 5
   keypresses in before any response from pine, then pine rapidly moves
   down the mail list EXCEPT that the response to the last keystroke is
   delayed by about 1-2sec.  This is the type of behavior I experienced
   [earlier] but then it was much much more pronounced (2-10sec). It
   works for fewer and more keypresses, and it seems to be there for a
   single keypress, its just not that noticeable under best response
   conditions.

He doesn't say so explicitly, but evidently he's in the folder Index
screen.  The problem appears to be independent of comm programs, and it
does not occur with gopher, another curses based program on the system.

Thanks for any help,

Any idea why the command | sz - doesn't work on a machine running BSDI 1.1?

I get an unusual response that looks exactly like this:

'cat myfile | sz -' works fine at the Unix (bash) prompt.

On similar machines, the pipe command works flawlessly.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Okay. I got Joe, I installed it (I think), and if I load Pine from the 
joe directory I can actually use it. (I am trying to emulate WordStar so 
I don't use the wrong commands in word processing and email letter 
writing, as now happens.)

I don't understand. Should I put joe in my main directory? Or can I 
somehow tell Pine where to find joe?

I have tried this one, but it works only if you take the address out of a
message addressed to more than one recipient. Only in this case can you
switch to List Mode.
 
Is there a way to TakeAddr to a list, when I am the only recipient?

We have the same problem here, but it only materializes when using PINE.
Elm sees the real INBOX without any troubles whatsoever, I guess further
showing that "Pine Is Not Elm".  It is annoyong when this happens and we do
not wish to dedicaate the resources to rewriting everyone's login script to
alleviate the problem.  Perhaps the PINE developers should look how Elm
handles the situation and copy it; or at least parse the /etc/alias file to
find the REAL inbox.  Just a suggestion...

Hallo,

I tried to create an Adressbook and to take the the adresses out of the 
messages I received and put them in the Adressbook.

When I try  usin, updatin, renaming the Adressbook or I want to correct 
the adresses/names, I somehow create problems.

I can't open the Adressbook

and the application blocks.

On my screen I See : Adressbook changed by another process re-syncing
		
		     Resetting Adress.book
	
And I have to reset the computer (warm .start)

Can you help me and send me also some easy understandable step by 
step information -while I'm not acquainted with computers- relating to the 
use of the Adressbook.

Thank you in advance for your benevolent help.

In a previous posting it was stated that PINE 3.91  for VMS is available
from lenin.cc.rochester.edu.

I have been attempting to connect to lenin.cc.rochester.edu from Australia
for several days now, but have never suceeded.

A ping shows 100% packet loss.

A traceroute gets as far as taylor4-bbgw.utd.rochester.edu and then nothing.

Is there a known difficulty in connecting to lenin.cc.rochester.edu?

Does anyone else have this version of PINE on an anonymous FTP  server?

	Hi,all !!
	I am using Pine 3.90 and I have a problem with my news folders.
The problem is that my folders disappear after i read another folder.
Strange isn't it ?
	Here is the story ...
	I am at the moment subscribed to comp.mail.pine and 
comp.mail.misc. In another pine window i subscribed to sci.space read two 
news there and deleted those two news i read. Then i pressed L to turn 
back to folder list.
	What do you i see at the window? Only sci.space!! The other two 
folders are lost. I happens all the time and i do not the way out.
	I also looked at my .newsrc file. It only contains the following 
after the operation :

sci.space:

	Can anyone with this peculiar behaviour of Pine 3.90.
	Thank you very much in advance .

 I run a Windows network which supports a multi-node BBS based on PowerBBS
for Windows. 
 I really like PCPine and use it personally whether over SLIP/PPP or logged
on to a providers UNIX system.
 PowrBBS for Windows has the capability of calling Windows Apps when they
are compiled as *.DLL. There are Telnet,FTP,and a few database and BBS door
type *.DLL apps available, well back to the real purpose for posting :

 I would love to be able to allow the dial-up BBS users to use PCPine for
a news / mail reader while on-line .... I'm sure that other PowerBBS
for Windows Administrators would be interested.

In this case the server does not accept the post since 
there are more quoted text then new text, as it says
in the above error message already.

I have the same problem here. I guess some news servers
have implemented some kind of a check for '>' chars in
the first line so as to keep the messages short. It's 
annoying. But I guess it can be circumvented by changing
the quotation method from '>' to something else. 
But, Pine has not an option to change this.

So, basically this is not a pine problem but, this might
be a good reason to make the quotation char optional in
future releases.

Selcuk

Friends,
I have been an enthusiastic user of pine on a unix machine for over
a year. I have just installed pc-pine 3.91 for windows. It seems to
work well... But --

I'm having troubling attaching files that reside on my hard disk or
floppy. The program clearly recognizes the file when I type the path
and file name into the 'attachment' line -- but when I am ready to
send the message, and hit ^X -- pine beeps twice and doesn't send
the message. The only way out is to cancel the message.

Have I misunderstood something here?

Many thanks

It's a bit obscure, but Yes.  First *Select* the message in question, 
then Apply Take.

We'll probably change the single address case to be more like the multiple
address case for 3.92.  It means one more keystroke for the non-list case,
but avoids the problem of having to be psychic to figure out how to do the
list case...

The only way I've thought of is to use a script of some sort which
randomly picks a file from a directory, and the pipes that file into
the editor of your choice.  I don't know all the details, but I could
find out if my comments here aren't enough to work with.

I am afraid that I'm missing something quite obvious (but I failed to find a
pointer in the setup menus). I at times keep mail around in temporary folders,
'till I get around to answering it. Then I remove the mail from the temp
folder.

How do I get Pine to automatically remove empty folders? Or do I really have
to run say an external shellscript to accomplish this?

Thanx in advance.. please reply by E-mail too, I might miss an answer.

Make sure that you have the "bounce" command enabled (main menu -> setup ->
config). When your get your mail back, re-check the address. Then bounce the
message to the same address or if you know of an alternative, bounce it to the
alternative address.

Or of course grab a "cookie" program. Then have cron run the following shell
say each our:

    #!/bin/sh
    cat > ~/.signature << EOF
    --
    Karel Kubat (karel@icce.rug.nl, karel@bambix.icce.rug.nl).
    EOF
    cookie >> ~/.signature
    
That's at least how this below is generated..

It's no use; the user can change this value ..

I also found the pine.conf.fixed location to be : /usr/local/lib

Many thanks for your helpful reply.  In the meantime, I find that
there is a more serious (!) problem: it doesn't seem to understand
MIME encoded mail.  I think this is because the incoming mail gets
an additional set of headers added ahead of the RFC822 headers.
Presumably this is a result of the way we have MULTINET configured,
and it allows MAIL to handle both SMTP and DECNET mail transparently.
 
The same situation probably explains why it does not compose
REPLY addresses properly: it seems to be using the added
headers rather than the RFC822 headers, so (when replying to
incoming SMTP mail) we get a reply address like this:
 
   "SMTP%a.user@some.domain.edu"@our.own.domain.name
 
I think our existing MAIL users would be upset if we were to change
the format of incoming mail, if they lost the ability to reply to
incoming DECNET mail.  Is there anything we can do to live with
this situation, and still use PINE (so as to be able to use MIME)?
 
(And again the question, "is there a better place for discussing
this VMS version"?).
 
best regards

One of my users is running the packet driver version of PCPine

I have a small problem:

Our global address book in pine 3.91 SCO-UNIX in:
/w2/bruger/pineaddr/globaddr

The problem is, that it is set to ReadOnly within pine for all users,
including root, althoug the permissions for the file is set to rw.

So how do I maintain this file?

You save the Fcc copy to your postponed-msgs folder (or whatever name you 
have called the folder where postponed messages go), then type C (ompose) 
and respond Yes (or select the message if you have more than one 
postponed), edit it totaste, and away you go.

The above avoids retyping (and I use it frequently!)

I think this is a dreadful idea. It of course harks back to long dead 
terminals which had arrows engraved on those keys, accessed, I think, in 
ESCAPE mode. 

As someone who teaches Pine, its transparency is a major virtue, and 
those places where this breaks down (like the dreadful Y for prYnt)  
cause problems; when teaching it is wonderful for A to be Add, C compose 
and so on. Previous and Next are enough alternatives to up-arrow and 
down-arrow, thanks.

Well, that's IMAP4, not IMAP2 (or bis or +). The most important
question is when IMAP4 servers and clients will be available!

What does Binhex do and why is it needed? I have the same problem
when sending an attached file (simple text file) from a PC (with
eudora) to my UNIX workstation (reading with pine). If I use pine
to send and read the attached file (as a test), there is no problem.

	BinHex is the encoding method used by the MAC world.  It is
"similar" to base64 and uuencode.  Whereas uuencode starts with

begin 666 file.name

	a "BinHex'd" file starts with

(This file must be read with BinHex 4.0)   Or something to that effect....

	One of the encoding methods available to eudora users is BinHex.
If they choose to send it to you with BinHex...then you will need BinHex
to decode it.  *IF* eudora would use BinHex within the framework of MIME
then it should be possible to decode the file automagically.  I'd have
to check...but I believe someone defined the headers for use in sending
BinHex files within MIME.

	I'm not familiar with the shareware version of eudora....but
the commercial version allow you to select MIME as your default attachment
handler.

Craig,
To a first approximation, all IMAP2 and IMAP2bis clients will work with 
IMAP4 servers, even though they will not be able to take advantage of the 
new features in IMAP4.

CMU has had their IMAP4 server in Beta for some time already.
Ours is coming...

Is there a way to configure pine such that it will ask you
if you want to send a copy to Fcc: rather than doing it
automatically?  I know that you can turn it on and off, but
is there a way so you can interactively use it?

thanks

Pico can only read lines of 256 or less characters.  It can create lines
of any (?) length though...

PC-Pine does not use POP, but it does require IMAP service from your mail
server.

Yes, psg.com runs a bi-directional gateway between comp.mail.pine and the
pine-info mailing list.  Note that it is operated by Randy Bush
<randy@psg.com>, not by the Pine Team.  Due to some lost messages that I 
just noticed a couple days ago the subscription address for the gateway 
was changed.  Hopefully that will improve performance and reliability of 
the gateway.

I have been trying to install PINE for VMS for a while now. We are 
running VMS 6.1 with DEC's UCX services. I obtained the PINE code from 
Israel and tried to compile it for the UCX service with little luck. Pine 
for VMS is a fairly important project for my organization so we are 
looking for help in getting PINE up from people who have done it before. 
We are even considering commercial sources for software that utilizes 
IMAP access.


Thanks in advance,

FYI, we are investigating setting this to 0 in future releases.  Doing so in
Pine 3.91, you will not get any .pine-debug files saved, but you will
(should) get a .pine-crash if Pine crashes....

The current Pine 3.91 release includes an "hpp" port for HP/UX.  There 
are also pre-compiled binaries available.  Both can be found on

Pine does not currently recognize mpeg files, so it labels that
application/octet-stream.  Pine 3.92 wqill have support for a .mime-types
file, so you can add other attachment types...

This may be a problem with the Pine 3.90 release you are using.  Upgrade to
Pine 3.91 and it should work better...

The best way to do this is to upgrade to Pine 3.91 which allows global

Are you using PC-Pine or telnetting to your Solaris account and using Unix
Pine?  If the latter, you need to ftp the file over to your Unix account

Pine 3.90 has several very serious bugs in the addressbook handling

Rename it, move it to the appropriate bin directory and mark it

	mv pico-bin.hpux9 /usr/local/bin/pico

Content-Description: What is Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages.

Content-Description: What is MIME?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers. 
If you have a Web browser you can access it through:

Content-Description: What is IMAP?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733.

Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is bi-directionally
gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.  For official 
          announcements only, you may wish to see pine-announce instead 
          of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
                  subscribe pine-info
 	  in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu. 
          
   Pine-Announce@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Announce is a announcement list for the email program
          Pine. When new Pine products are released and old ones updated,
          a message goes out to this group describing the development. It
          is a very low volume list and includes no discussion
          whatsoever.
          
          NOTE: All messages to this list are automatically forwarded to
          pine-info, so it is not necessary to subscribe to both lists!
          
          To subscribe to pine-announce, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
                  subscribe pine-announce
	  in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-announce@cac.washington.edu.
          
   IMAP@CAC.Washington.EDU 
          This is the official mailing list for the IETF IMAP working
          group and other interested parties. Discussion of the evolving
          IMAP standard and related issues is conducted on this list.

Content-Description: How many sites use Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine's cancel/postpone/etc key work?

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home
directory called .signature containing the text you want appended to each
message.
   
PC-Pine users should put their signatures in the file \PINE\PINE.SIG.

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail.

Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

When viewing the message, use the '|' (Pipe) command and give it the
following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description: Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at:

Subject: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

Subject: How do I convert a Sun Mailtool attachment to MIME format?
                                       

A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows mail
to MIME. Body parts currently supported are: text, gif, Sun rasterfile
(converted to image/gif), postscript, and audio. Other types default to
application/octet-stream. It's easy to extend the set of types supported
and to add conversions, if necessary. 
   
The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the
"convert" program from ImageMagick. If you don't have ImageMagick you can
probably substitute the pbm stuff with little fuss. 

If you are reading this with a MIME browser, the the script and program
should be included in the next two attachments.

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Pine does not currently support this directly, but here is a work-around: 
    1. Move the cursor to the Cc: line. 
    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line.

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

Subject: Can PC-Pine be used with a POP server?

                                       

No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail model
(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,
in a future release.

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

Subject: Where does Pine look for configuration information?

                                     
In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?
                                       

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: Pine 3.89 on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.3 crashes every time I try to open a folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not
correctly compile certain constructs used in Pine 3.89 and earlier. We
think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?

From: Gunther Anderson <gunther@ssi.edc.org>
Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that 
the problem is specific to that message.

The list for 3.92 is not frozen yet.  This release will have a number of
bug fixes, but it will also introduce several new features.  Some of
the things we know will be there include:

 o Fix for some pine.conf variables not working (e.g. local bug address).
 o Delete flag will no longer be preserved on Save.
 o Bky mbox format performance bug fixed.
 o Reply prompt will change if there is a Newsgroups header present.
 o Improvements in software flow-control handling.
 o Improvements in bug report command.
 o Ability to specify an alternative to the sendmail MTA.
 o Support for negotiating 8BITMIME with an ESMTP server.
 o Mouse support for use with X terminals.
 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

	In this particular instance I'd prefer to use forward over the
bounce command.  

	If I am correct the bounce command will leave the original To:'s
and Cc:'s attached to the message and but will add a Sender: header.

	Not all UAs will show the Sender: header....and it sometimes leave
people scratching their heads as to how an email reached them with an
incorrect email address......

	Just my opinion.....

I also had this problem, cause when I send messages to FidoNet there
is noch converter QP->8Bit and in FidoNet nobody can understand the
QPs.  So I got the pine-source 3.91 and added the following patch:

With this little patch pine uses "8bit" instead of "Quoted-Printable",
if it finds any character with the 8th bit set. This solved the
problem for me, but it would be nice, if this could be configurable in
.pinerc....

Ciao

Not all UAs show the Resent-* headers either, including older versions of

I figured out what the problem is.  I am running it on a 300 series HP9000
which has a CISC processor in it.  I moved it over to a G30 which uses a RISC
processor and it works fine.  

The next question I have is, does anyone have it compiled on a CISC processor
where I might be able to get a hold of it?  It would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

 I have a question about Pine.
Is it possible to receive a message from the server of your recipient
when your e-mail message arrived (or has been read) at the server of your
recipient ? (perhaps customized-hdrs ????)


Thank you very much,

I want to prevent the use of the "enable-mail-check-cue" feature. 
But I can't get it to work (or not work). 
What will it tell the user who tries to change that which I have said NO to? 

Are there any samples of good pine.conf.fixed files out there?

Subject: Incoming folders ? GO AWAY!
Date: Fri, 27 Jan 95 07:34:41 GMT
Message-Id: <3g9ink$b0p@henry.interlink.no>

HI! Just been installing procmail on my system and all works well. Then I
start pine and find that NOW I have two folder collections, one for
Incoming and one for Collections. This used to be just a list like:
INBOX    sent-mail     read-mail

Now I've got

Incoming folders: INBOX
Folder collections: sent-mail    read-mail

I want it back the way it was. Now if I try to add an incoming box created by
procmail I get it BOTH in the Incoming folders list AND the Folder collections
list. So, how do just get ONE folder list? OR how do I prevent pine from adding
the folder I've manually added to Incoming to the Folder collections?

It is like this:

Incoming folders: INBOX     MAILINGLISTS
Folder collections: sent-mail	read-mail     MAILINFLISTS

and I want it like this (or not at all!)

Incoming folders: INBOX     MAILINGLISTS
Folder collections: sent-mail	read-mail


Thanks for any help ANY of you can give!

I have 5 (10, counting aliases).  I use procmail (obtained from ftp.uu.net)
to spot the account to which the mail was sent, and I pre-sort everything
into separate mailboxes in one account.  I have two signature variants that
I invoke with two keystroke commands.  That's all satisfactory;  the only
problem I have is that I still re-set the Reply-to line by hand, so that
any replies go to the same administrative address that received the original
query.

Reinhard, I think you might find it works better to work from a single
account, and change the Reply-to as needed, rather than work from many
accounts and change the From to identify yourself.

But the answer to your question would still be useful:  how can I change
the Reply-to line in a more automated fashion?

I set it to be root's personal addressbook as well.  Now, whenever I want 
to make a change to the global addressbook, I just edit the personal 
mailbox while logged in as root.  I have the following line in /.pinerc:

address-book=/usr/lib/addressbook

And in pine.conf, I also have:

global-address-book=/usr/lib/addressbook

If you need to have a real personal addressbook for root, I'm sure you 
could work out something with multiple personal addressbooks.

  My suggestion was to ADD functionality, not to change any of the
  current keys.  Even if the terminals you mentioned are long dead,
  the fact remains that many people use those keys today to navigate,
  and many other applications support them.

  Under my suggestion, you would still be able to use the "transparent"
  keys for navigation, but you would also be able to use some others,
  if you so desired.  It seems to me that one of Pine's virtues
  is the fact that it supports a lot of advanced functions, but you
  don't have to turn them all on.  My suggestions for navigational
  keys need not be the default.

The only way I've thought of is to use a script of some sort which
randomly picks a file from a directory, and the pipes that file into
the editor of your choice.  I don't know all the details, but I could
find out if my comments here aren't enough to work with.

I just happened to count my local mailboxes recently for administrative
purposes (phone dial-in accounting etc). I came out with 85 different 
addresses you can send mail to and soon or later I'll read it anyway. In order
to keep administration simple I happen to use accounts where the same .sig 
or 'From' is put in. 

Question -  depending on the operating system, I use pine, ean, eudora, and 
pmdf mailers. Not to mention various newsreaders to reply from. I could need
a 'signature switcher' on UNIX - has anyone written something like this 
to get into pine? Not only the .sig file,but the 'From' should be changed 
as well.

Stupid question probably, but where to place these files ?

I am afraid that I'm missing something quite obvious (but I failed to find a
pointer in the setup menus). I at times keep mail around in temporary folders,
'till I get around to answering it. Then I remove the mail from the temp
folder.

How do I get Pine to automatically remove empty folders? Or do I really have
to run say an external shellscript to accomplish this?

Thanx in advance.. please reply by E-mail too, I might miss an answer.

Or of course grab a "cookie" program. Then have cron run the following shell
say each our:

    #!/bin/sh
    cat > ~/.signature << EOF
    --
    Karel Kubat (karel@icce.rug.nl, karel@bambix.icce.rug.nl).
    EOF
    cookie >> ~/.signature
    
That's at least how this below is generated..

Make sure that you have the "bounce" command enabled (main menu -> setup ->
config). When your get your mail back, re-check the address. Then bounce the
message to the same address or if you know of an alternative, bounce it to the
alternative address.

Many thanks for your helpful reply.  In the meantime, I find that
there is a more serious (!) problem: it doesn't seem to understand
MIME encoded mail.  I think this is because the incoming mail gets
an additional set of headers added ahead of the RFC822 headers.
Presumably this is a result of the way we have MULTINET configured,
and it allows MAIL to handle both SMTP and DECNET mail transparently.
 
The same situation probably explains why it does not compose
REPLY addresses properly: it seems to be using the added
headers rather than the RFC822 headers, so (when replying to
incoming SMTP mail) we get a reply address like this:
 
   "SMTP%a.user@some.domain.edu"@our.own.domain.name
 
I think our existing MAIL users would be upset if we were to change
the format of incoming mail, if they lost the ability to reply to
incoming DECNET mail.  Is there anything we can do to live with
this situation, and still use PINE (so as to be able to use MIME)?
 
(And again the question, "is there a better place for discussing
this VMS version"?).
 
best regards

OK, folks.  I've managed to patch poor old Lenin back together & get
everything up & running with a temporary disk.  ftp should be working ok
now, but will be down briefly when I find a long-term replacement for the
second disk.  In the meantime, Pine/VMS is back in the original location.

 I have a question about Pine.
Is it possible to receive a message from the server of your recipient
when your e-mail message arrived (or has been read) at the server of your
recipient ? (perhaps customized-hdrs ????)


Thank you very much,

I have a small problem:

Our global address book in pine 3.91 SCO-UNIX in:
/w2/bruger/pineaddr/globaddr

The problem is, that it is set to ReadOnly within pine for all users,
including root, althoug the permissions for the file is set to rw.

So how do I maintain this file?

Subject: I need CISC version of PICO on HP-UX9
Date: 27 Jan 1995 23:40:18 GMT
Message-Id: <3gc092$4sd@nic-nac.CSU.net>



I figured out what the problem is.  I am running pico on a 300 series HP9000
which has a CISC processor in it.  I moved it over to a G30 which uses a RISC
processor and it works fine.  

The next question I have is, does anyone have it compiled on a CISC processor
where I might be able to get a hold of it?  It would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Mike

You save the Fcc copy to your postponed-msgs folder (or whatever name you 
have called the folder where postponed messages go), then type C (ompose) 
and respond Yes (or select the message if you have more than one 
postponed), edit it totaste, and away you go.

The above avoids retyping (and I use it frequently!)

We have the same problem here, but it only materializes when using PINE.
Elm sees the real INBOX without any troubles whatsoever, I guess further
showing that "Pine Is Not Elm".  It is annoyong when this happens and we do
not wish to dedicaate the resources to rewriting everyone's login script to
alleviate the problem.  Perhaps the PINE developers should look how Elm
handles the situation and copy it; or at least parse the /etc/alias file to
find the REAL inbox.  Just a suggestion...

Okay. I got Joe, I installed it (I think), and if I load Pine from the 
joe directory I can actually use it. (I am trying to emulate WordStar so 
I don't use the wrong commands in word processing and email letter 
writing, as now happens.)

I don't understand. Should I put joe in my main directory? Or can I 
somehow tell Pine where to find joe?

Subject: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages.

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers.

Content-Description: What is IMAP?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733.

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its

60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

On some systems, certain control characters are intercepted before they
get to Pine.  This is usually a problem with the communication software
running on a Mac or PC, but terminal servers sometimes intercept certain
control characters as well.

Control-C and Control-O seem to be two of the most common problem cases.
As a work-around, you can press the ESCAPE key twice followed by the
desired key.  For example, if Control-O (^O) does not work on your system,
try typing "ESC ESC O".  This trick will work for any control character.

Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind carbon
copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as you
compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default
Pine configuration, so you may need to use the rich headers command
(Ctrl-R) while the cursor is in the header to expose it.

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

Subject: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?


Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home
directory called .signature containing the text you want appended to each
message.
   
PC-Pine users should put their signatures in the file \PINE\PINE.SIG.

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail. 
   
For a more detailed treatment of filtering, see the Filtering Mail FAQ and
the Procmail FAQ.  The hypertext version of these are available at:

Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description: Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at: 
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack

This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Subject: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows mail
to MIME. Body parts currently supported are: text, gif, Sun rasterfile
(converted to image/gif), postscript, and audio. Other types default to
application/octet-stream. It's easy to extend the set of types supported
and to add conversions, if necessary. 
   
The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the
"convert" program from ImageMagick. If you don't have ImageMagick you can
probably substitute the pbm stuff with little fuss. 

If you are reading this with a MIME browser, the the script and program

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Pine does not currently support this directly, but here is a work-around: 
    1. Move the cursor to the Cc: line. 
    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line. 
    4. Move the cursor where you want it in the body of the message. 
    5. Press Ctrl-U to insert the address. 
       
   This is a round-about way to get the job done, but it works...

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail model
(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the 
Main Menu) contain a section on Configuration, including default file names 
and environment variables.  Almost all personal configuration can be
accomplished through the Setup (S) command on the main menu. 

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not

think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of

Subject: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

Subject: Why should I use the builtin Bug Report command?

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that 
the problem is specific to that message.

When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point that
a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce
the problem in the current version, our standard response will be to ask
you to upgrade.

We don't know right now.  3.92 is under active development, but no dates
yet.  Besides, our track-record on meeting projected release schedules is
terrible, so you shouldn't believe any dates we are foolish enough to
suggest anyway.

Subject: What new features will future releases of Pine include?

The list for 3.92 is not frozen yet.  This release will have a number of
bug fixes, but it will also introduce several new features.  Some of
the things we know will be there include:

 o Fix for some pine.conf variables not working (e.g. local bug address).
 o Delete flag will no longer be preserved on Save.
 o Bky mbox format performance bug fixed.
 o Reply prompt will change if there is a Newsgroups header present.
 o Improvements in software flow-control handling.
 o Improvements in bug report command.
 o Ability to specify an alternative to the sendmail MTA.
 o Support for negotiating 8BITMIME with an ESMTP server.
 o Mouse support for use with X terminals.
 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

 I run a Windows network which supports a multi-node BBS based on PowerBBS
for Windows. 
 I really like PCPine and use it personally whether over SLIP/PPP or logged
on to a providers UNIX system.
 PowrBBS for Windows has the capability of calling Windows Apps when they
are compiled as *.DLL. There are Telnet,FTP,and a few database and BBS door
type *.DLL apps available, well back to the real purpose for posting :

 I would love to be able to allow the dial-up BBS users to use PCPine for
a news / mail reader while on-line .... I'm sure that other PowerBBS
for Windows Administrators would be interested.

Is there a way to configure pine such that it will ask you
if you want to send a copy to Fcc: rather than doing it
automatically?  I know that you can turn it on and off, but
is there a way so you can interactively use it?

Comes here Mr. Joyce Y. Wong with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 26 Jan 1995 16:46:31 -0800:

 +   Is there a way to configure pine such that it will ask you

 +   automatically?  I know that you can turn it on and off, but
 +   is there a way so you can interactively use it?

Turn the default option to off, then while composing you can set the value
to the Fcc: header to whichever folder you want by using ^R for rich
headers.

Ofcourse if you want that header to appear by default for every composition
just add that in the default-composer-hdrs option in the Setup/Config screen.

default-composer-hdrs = Fcc,
                       Subject,
                       Bcc,
                       Cc,
                       To

Hope this helps.

Here goes, you can find a POP3 mail server, source and binaries
ported to Solaris 2.x at:

ftp://ftp.digex.net/pub/access/schueman/popper.tar.gz

This code has been subjected to constant use since April 1994 under 
Solaris 2.3.

Subject: HELP ME GET RID OF MY [17;3H's PLEASE!!!
Date: 27 Jan 1995 21:29:18 -0500
Message-Id: <3gca5u$t1c@panix.com>

Here is one that seems to have stumped everyone. I have Procomm for DOS 
(version 2.0l) on a 386sx DOS 4.01 (go ahead laugh) running into a 
Practical Perpherals pm14400fxmt modem and I use Pine and Pico on my 
internet provider PANIX.

The problem started a few days ago when I had to reconfig Procomm because 
of a problem I am having. Now when ever I am in PINE or PICO I see these 
strange things like [5;41H whenever I backspace use my arrow keys. Odd 
things also keep happening on the very top and bottom lines of the 
screen. Where I see bit of the text appearing. Sometimes as well the 
cursor seems to get stuck on a line.  Everything clears up when I ^L 
(refresh the screen.)

Easy you say, a terminal emulation problem. That is what the staff at 
PANIX kept telling me.  Procomm is set to one terminal and PANIX is set 
to another. But it wasn't true alas. I kept reconfiguring both and 
checking my "termtype" file as they told me to and the status line on 
Procomm and they are the same. I tried VT100, VT102, VT220. Same problems.

So I call Procomm. I am on the telephone with them for of an hour (at my 
expense of course) They tried everything. Me calling them via modem etc., 
etc. And they can't figure it out either.

When I use another crummy communications program I have (QL2FAX) I don't 
get this problem at all so it has to be Procomm. But what?

If anyone can figure this out I would be grateful forever... I sent you 
an original copy of DOS 1.1 ...I'd name your price. 

Help I am seeing [20;12H's in my sleep.

Try Yehavi's own home site, VMS.HUJI.AC.IL - from an anonymous FTP
do a CD LOCAL, all should then be clear.
 
(I called it from a MULTINET-based VMS system, used BINARY and
STRUCT VMS, and successfully retrieved the UNZIP.EXE and the
PINExxxx.ZIP).
 
Keep in touch: I'm trying to get this working for my users, but with
apparently so few people using it on VMS it's difficult to get
advice.  (This forum is overwhelmed by un*x-based people, and
the rest seem to be PC-based.  There are very few references to
VMS, and some of those seem to refer to a commercial port of PINE).

I think this is a dreadful idea. It of course harks back to long dead 
terminals which had arrows engraved on those keys, accessed, I think, in 
ESCAPE mode. 

As someone who teaches Pine, its transparency is a major virtue, and 
those places where this breaks down (like the dreadful Y for prYnt)  
cause problems; when teaching it is wonderful for A to be Add, C compose 
and so on. Previous and Next are enough alternatives to up-arrow and 
down-arrow, thanks.

think Lotus working on a version that is faster and

I'm currently using pc-pine3.91 and experience problems sending

message is never sent.  I tested Pine on the host running imapd
and its sendmail doesnt have a problem.  Any ideas?

In a previous posting it was stated that PINE 3.91  for VMS is available
from lenin.cc.rochester.edu.

I have been attempting to connect to lenin.cc.rochester.edu from Australia
for several days now, but have never suceeded.

A ping shows 100% packet loss.

A traceroute gets as far as taylor4-bbgw.utd.rochester.edu and then nothing.

Is there a known difficulty in connecting to lenin.cc.rochester.edu?

Does anyone else have this version of PINE on an anonymous FTP  server?

Yet another Pine related ".*" file.
In future releases is it possible to direct them all Pine related .files to
a directory (.pine or something similar) that way it will be easy to tell
what are all the dot files that Pine looks up by default without having to
modify that in the os-xxx.h file and rebuild.

As of now we have:
pinerc

addressbook.lu
pine-debug*
pine-interrupted
pine-interrupted-lock
soon .mime-type,....

PC-Pine does not use POP, but it does require IMAP service from your mail
server.

Yes, psg.com runs a bi-directional gateway between comp.mail.pine and the
pine-info mailing list.  Note that it is operated by Randy Bush
<randy@psg.com>, not by the Pine Team.  Due to some lost messages that I 
just noticed a couple days ago the subscription address for the gateway 
was changed.  Hopefully that will improve performance and reliability of 
the gateway.

Pico can only read lines of 256 or less characters.  It can create lines
of any (?) length though...

I have been trying to install PINE for VMS for a while now. We are 
running VMS 6.1 with DEC's UCX services. I obtained the PINE code from 
Israel and tried to compile it for the UCX service with little luck. Pine 
for VMS is a fairly important project for my organization so we are 
looking for help in getting PINE up from people who have done it before. 
We are even considering commercial sources for software that utilizes 
IMAP access.


Thanks in advance,

The best way to do this is to upgrade to Pine 3.91 which allows global

The current Pine 3.91 release includes an "hpp" port for HP/UX.  There 
are also pre-compiled binaries available.  Both can be found on

This may be a problem with the Pine 3.90 release you are using.  Upgrade to
Pine 3.91 and it should work better...

Pine 3.90 has several very serious bugs in the addressbook handling 
code.  These are fixed in the current Pine 3.91 release.  Upgrade!

Pine does not currently recognize mpeg files, so it labels that
application/octet-stream.  Pine 3.92 wqill have support for a .mime-types
file, so you can add other attachment types...

Subject: Serious BUG in Pine???
Date: 29 Jan 1995 01:06:09 GMT
Message-Id: <3gepm2$fsb@news-feed-1.PeachNet.EDU>

Our SysAdmin was forced to remove access to Pine on our system, and to 
tell us to stop using our own copies.  According to him, when executed, Pine 
creates a ~2Meg temporary file in the /tmp directory.  However, it 
doesn't always delete this file when the user finishes.  Since the file's 
ownership is set to the mailer daemon, the user cannot manually delete this 
file.  After a while, the /tmp directory is filled with numerous ~2Meg 
files.  He said he's even tried the newest version of Pine, and this 
problem persisted.

I tried it out, to see if I could see what he was talking about.  My 
roommate ran Pine, then checked the /tmp directory, and there was a new
mailer daemon file, created about the time he executed Pine.  (It had some 
randomly generated name, like MX8AFJ or some such.)  He couldn't remove 
it, and it sat there unchanged for days.  *I* ran Pine, and looked for a 
temp file, but there wasn't one -- however, notably I didn't compose a 
message, whereas my roommate did.  {We haven't tried anything beyond this, 
because we don't want to provoke the ire of our SysAdmin.)

Anyone know what's going on??

The PC-Pine source comes as part of the standard pine source
distribution.  However, we never intended for others to modify or
compile PC-Pine so you will pretty much be on your own in getting it
to compile.

As for converting to a true windows application -- of course it's
possible, it's just a matter of programming.

Can anyone tell me how to mark multiple news messages as deleted with 
Pine 3.91.  I love the ability to jump from group to group with the Tab 
key but would like to know how to mark all the messages of a group as 
deleted before leaving the group.  I'd like to not have to press the "d"

 +   The problem started a few days ago when I had to reconfig Procomm because 
 +   of a problem I am having. Now when ever I am in PINE or PICO I see these 
 +   strange things like [5;41H whenever I backspace use my arrow keys. Odd

 +   screen. Where I see bit of the text appearing. Sometimes as well the

 +   (refresh the screen.)

 +   Help I am seeing [20;12H's in my sleep.

On the face of it, it looks like you have to reset your modem's flow control.
Try setting XON/XOFF off. If that doesn't work, try positing to comp.*.modems
you probabaly will get better help than before. :-)

Steve, 

I think this is the way that sendmail works. At page 583 of the sendmail
handbook (by Bryan Costales) you can find a description for the receipt
header.

When sendmail finds that header in a message, it sends the receipt. It
does so just after the message is delivered. So the mail user agent
(pine in our case) isn't involved at all.

In my opinion, what you are looking for, is a mail user agent with a X- 
(user defined header) to do your work. Sendmail ignores such headers.
It passes such headers to the user agent as they are. Does anyone know a
user agent supporting a feature like this? Or, does pine support this 
feature?

Savas.

I am using a Lynx 125 terminal (in the VT100 emulation mode) to connect 
to an AIX version of pine.  I have a NEC Pinwriter P5XL printer attached 
to the terminal via a parallel port.  While using a similar setup permits 
me to print successfully from a CD-ROM based Medline system at our 
hospital's library, it does not seem to respond properly either to the 
PC or lprint mode of printing from pine.  Without buying a home computer 
and a communication package, is there any way of printing directly in 
this terminal-parallel printer configuration from pine?

Your reply is much appreciated.

For those cases where there are problems, are you planning on having a

Yes, in early January, Netcom, which is currently handling our DNS 
entries for us, made a real mess out of things, resulting in total mail
loss for approximately 3 days.  Needless to say, we're working on

I haven't hacked sendmail.cf for a couple of years, but I am not sure most
rule sets will be able to handle this.  Most people have been throwing bang
addresses on the floor for several years.  I also think having two 'ats' will
be confusing.  The first chore is to get it to britain.eu.net, which needs
to be at the right following and @.  Then it looks like the next machine to
get it to is cso2.uucp.  Therefore cso2.uucp@britain.eu.net should be OK.  I
believe the rest of the address should be with %'s.  Therefore

  dbradley%cso-unix%c6%cso2.uucp@britain.eu.net

MIGHT get there.

It would be a lot easier if everyone was at a registered domain, hiding
behind a chain of MX records.

Subject: Loop prog. staggers mail but needs help, please
Date: 29 Jan 1995 16:31:46 GMT
Message-Id: <3ggfti$1pi@nntp.crl.com>

	I have a prog. that sends E-mails to my distrib. list one at a
time so as not to clog the system BUT....
	1) It also sends E-mail to the nickname and the fullname as well 
as the address so the wrong people are getting my mail and are POed about 
it (how? If the only fullname I have for someone is "Paul", say, it sends 
my file to Paul@crl.com by default). How can I get the prog. to send mail 
only to the line with the @ sign in it? Can't be the 3rd section of each 
line as some line have no fullname name at all and therefore only 2 parts.
	2) After sending 500 e-mails my access provider times out and 
logs me off.
	What can I do to produce the odd action so I'm not timed off?
	Thanks for all help. It is MUCH appreciated! Best, John in Concord, Cal.

Is there a way to get Pine 3.91 to read my environment variable 'Reply-To'?
I have been manually inserting the Reply-To line in _each_ letter I write, 
and it is gettting quite annoying.

Pine 3.91, Linux 1.1.85, bash.

Please reply by email.

Thanks --

Out of 2500 users a few are reporting that when in Pine their screens 
won't clear. They wind up typing over previous screens or messages. It 
looks as if the messages themselves are okay, but, of course, it;s pretty 
difficult to type over old messages or menu screens. 

At first I thought this was a simple terminal emulation problem. Change 
to VT-100 and reboot. Then I thought it must be certain comm packages, 
like old Telix, that can't quite cut it. 

But upon investigation I can't find a common element. For some people it 
even happens with Procomm, our favorite around here. 

Anybody got a clue? I don't!

It would cause a serious invasion of privacy, so it would ideally

You got a _lot_ of suggestions on this one, all of them viable.  IMHO, 
going to your sent-mail folder, viewing the message, and forwarding it to 
the correct address is the least labor intensive.  Once you hit "f" for 
forward, Pine puts the message into a compose window where you can 
quickly enter the correct address, edit out the "(fwd)" appended to the 
subject (don't want it to be obvious that you goofed!), and edit out the 
original header stuff that now appears in the message text (same reason, 
plus all that extra junk will just annoy the recipient).

Under Setup/Config (Main Menu) at the 'default-composer-hdrs' option add
  Reply-To: gsutter@psu.edu   
and all other headers (without values) you wish to see. (Only 'From:' 
won't be shown in the composition mode, I wish it would - I like to 
change my real name once in a while without having to change the setup. 
Suggestions anybody?)

Hi, I just got onto this list.  I'm told there is a general belief
that there's no interest in a Pine port for OS/2.  I'm here to
state that it's more likely that few OS/2 users know about this
newsgroup/mailing-list.

BTW - I picked up on the OS/2 groups that a port of pico is 
available ftp, which I'm using right now to write this message.
It works pretty well.  I'm planning on using it for accessing
UUCP news through my BBS.  Now, I just have to work out extracting
the user name, which shouldn't be too difficult.  Pico will be
ideal for this, since I don't have to worry about [Esc] or
function keys or any of that other junk that DOS & OS/2 programs
seem to rely on.

I also noticed in the docs that Pine was written with NNTP
in mind (please correct me if I read wrong).  Will it work
with UUCP (esp. UUPC from Clarkson)?

Why not make it user-configurable in .pinerc (via Setup in the Main Menu)?

Hi.

For me and probably for many others the sequence ';aad' (followed by TAB)
is the most commonly used (catching up all postings in one newsgroup and 
skipping to the next). It is also the answer to every other question 
posted comp.mail.pine. Why not dedicating *one* key to this (keeping the 
other aggregated commands)?

Just my $2/100.

Subject: several Pine suggestions
Date: 23 Jan 1995 17:35:56 GMT
Message-Id: <3g0pds$r9c@hobbes.cc.uga.edu>

I really enjoy using Pine, and I appreciate the work that the authors have
put into developing and supporting it.  Here are a few suggestions for
future releases of Pine that the developers can "take or leave".  Thanks!

1)  In INDEX mode, allow the 'k' and 'j' keys to be used to move the current
    pointer up and down (j key would only function like this if
    jump short cut were turned on).  This convention can be
    found in vi, Elm, Gopher, and other utilities, so it makes things
    somewhat consistent.

2)  When reading a message with the builtin Pine pager, the spacebar
    scrolls the message down one page.  Add a feature such that the
    RETURN key can be used to scroll down one line.  This convention
    is used with the Unix more and less commands, as well as some
    other pagers.

3)  Add a special Quit-type command that will exit Pine without making
    any changes to the current folder.  For example, when this command
    is used, all messages marked for deletion will NOT be deleted, and
    all messages that were marked as new ('N') when the folder was
    opened will still be marked as such when the folder is opened 
    the next time.

4)  Add an option that makes the 'n' (NextMsg) command in the INDEX skip
    over messages marked for deletion.

They're definitely there.  However, frp.celestial.com recently changes 
its IP address, and a lot of sites still don't know about it.  The change 
happened a couple of months ago, but my site (for instance) still finds 
the old address.  I've just looked at the real site, and there are two 
files which you are looking for:

-rw-rw-r--   1 jwc      4217275 Nov 25 11:10 pine-3.91.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r--   1 jwc      1065011 Nov 28 17:47 pine3.91.sco.bins.tar.gz

The first has both source and binaries.  The second, binaries only.

The new information for ftp.celestial.com is that it's an alias for 
camco1.celestial.com, 192.136.111.2.  Go there directly.

There is no autodelete feature for empty folders.  On the other hand,
there's no need for a shell script, either.  In the folder list ("L" from
the main menu), select the folder you want to delete and press "d" to 
delete it.

Yep, double the performance!  <g>  I've been receiving two copies of 
every pine-info message for the past few days.  Is this a bug or a 
feature?  :-)

Message-Id: <raider-2901950056080001@slip-14-10.ots.utexas.edu>

I am trying to configure PINE on a PC running Linux and am having a
problem. Is there any way to set up pine to check and send mail using a
remote server? My problem basically is that I want to be able to check my
mail on mail.utexas.edu using pine and also send mail through this server.


If this is not possible using pine (i.e., if pine will only use sendmail
and work for local e-mail), can someone recommend a good mail program (an
X program would be nice) that would be a good alternative to PINE?

Thanks. If you wouldn't mind replying via e-mail, that would be great.

I don't have a clue, but wanted to say I have seen the same thing.  It
isn't a major problem but is very annoying. I have seen it using both
Procomm and Telix.  Usually ^L will clear the extra stuff out of the
way.  For me, it is  usually the last line on the screen when using
the reply mode that doesn't clear.

Why?  The mail check cue seems relatively harmless.  Inquiring minds want
to know...

since joining this newsgroup I have seen several references to using
the select (;) command.  I have tried it in various screens and it
always tells me it is an unknown command.  I am using version
3.90 on one account and 3.91 on another.

Can someone provide further information on this command?

Feature, of course.  And we are not even charging extra for the first trial
weeks.  :-)

Subject: Pine patch for security on BBSes
Date: 30 Jan 1995 06:16:23 GMT
Message-Id: <3gi07n$352@kadath.zeitgeist.net>


I created a patch in order to have a '-s' secure option.  We are running
a BBS, and didn't want users below a certain level to be able to send
mail outside of the local BBS.  So this patch, from the pine3.91
directory made from the tar file using the -p1 option, adds a command   
line argument '-s' so that the user can't compose, reply to, or forward  
messages.  If they attempt to, they get a message saying that they don't
have write-mail privileges.

Inside our BBS, we have it check the level of the user, and if they
attempt to call pine, we call it with or without the '-s' option.  The
BBS software checks if they're trying to put people's names to send to on
the commandline, and if they are, checks if it's an external user (I
check for '@' and '.'s).  It won't let users of a lesser security
clearance send mail from the commandline to the outside world.

This, for us, allows the public to connect without us having to worry if
they're sending death threats to the president, or whatever, until we
have their address or whatever we require of them.

Here you go...

Look at ftp://ftp.digex.net/pub/access/schueman/popper.tar.gz.

This contains source + binaries for a POP3 server. It was compiled under
Solaris 2.3 on a Sparc 10.

Gregory,  

The easiest thing to do is to enter the Reply-To entry as a customised 
header to PINE.  This is what I do on my Linux box.  

To to this, simply press S (setup) from the main menu and then C for 
config.  Now move down to Customised Headers and add the Reply-To field.

I am having this trouble ie. malformed return addresses (we are using UCX not
multinet), I am trying to hack the reply.c source to parse out the appropriate
stuff (unless someone can come up with a more elegent solution :). The problem
I am having is that I put a few printf( or fprintf(stderr.. into the code and
it compiles OK but blows up when that statement is hit. Any suggestions how
to debug this?

Something similar happened to me. Pine reports the right length, but
does not display the message. After I looked in my mailbox with emacs
(or any other text editor, capable of displaying control codes), I saw
a block of 4096 zeroes in the file. 4096=4K and is exactly one virtual
memory page. Pine does not display the rest of the text, probably it
is treating the message as a zero-delimited string by the C convention :-( 
The problem is caused most probably by an incoherency in the NSF
mounting of the mail directory :-(

Subject: PINE 3.07 too slow

PINE 3.07 was installed about one year ago, is used internally by some users
on our system, and has worked beautifully until last week.

Since last Friday we are having problem using it. After executing the command 
'pine' it takes from two to three minutes for the menu to come up. It then 
displays '0 messages' when I know that there are several messages old and new. 
Whatever the next command is it takes another two to three minutes again but 
then the number of messages is displayed correctly. From then on everything 
pops up immediately (the way it's supposed to) like cancel out of a message,
go to the Main or Other menu, quit, etc. 

I've tried searching for information on the tech-notes and README files with 
no success. I've tried to use PINE while nobody else was on the system to 
eliminate the possibility that there was an overload of processes on the 
system (as suggested by a Sequent technician), I've re-booted the system to 
make sure there wasn't anything 'hanging' that I didn't know of. All other
softwares are working as usual. 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

I would like to know if there is some way to set a configuration in pine 
so that users can't change it from the Setup menu.  Specifically, I want 
to restrict the alternate editor feature.  I have specified 
'no-enable-alternate-editor' in pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed but this 
doesn't seem to do it.  Can anyone help?

How do you keep people from simply cursoring up and changing the "To: "

How do I import a file that contains addresses and then transfer them to

I want to avoid having to retype the entire list within PINE.  

Thanks.

Message-Id: <1995Jan30.154726.10716@emba.uvm.edu>
Date: Mon, 30 Jan 1995 15:47:26 GMT

  Like many other folks running AIX 3.2, we've been dealing with the
ever-annoying Pine 3.91 interrupted mail bug.  The bug whenever a
user has a zero-length ~/.pine-interrupted-mail or
~/mail/postponed-msgs file and tries to compose a new message.  The
following is a patch to send.c in the pine code (use 'patch <
send.c.patch' in the pine3.91/pine/ directory to apply the patch).
This is a very small patch, but has proven quite effective in curing
this particular problem for us.

  Disclaimer:  We make no promises that this will work for you, we only
know it works for us under AIX 3.2.5....

Regards,

Kevin

Message-Id: <3g1ftq$pff@cronkite.ocis.temple.edu>

Comes here Mr. Steve Lowe with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 22 Jan 1995 23:55:04 -0800:

 +   I prompted this discussion with how could I send mail messages 
 +   registered.  Is there a simple way to do this within PINE 3.91?

What do you mean by registered?

 +   > Many, *many* people consider read-receipts to be an invasion of privacy
 +   > would refuse to use any tool that "offered" such a facility.  I would not
 +   > look for this feature in Pine anytime soon...
 +
 +   So just have an option (settable from the setup menu) that turns receipts
 +   on.  (ie have it default to off)  This is a feature available on cc:Mail,
 +   and was used extensively where I last worked -- it can be a great help

We have cc:Mail for inter-office email over a LAN and I (many others) *HATE*
it when someone sends me a mail requesting reciept.

Nowadays mail from "i will always ask for recpt" types don't get read at all.
I just forward them to myself and then read it and if it is worth i will reply
else i will let the sender wonder why I haven't read the "reciept reqd. mail"

Please do not include this feature(or bug i should say) in Pine. I don't want
the system spend precious CPU time sending stupid reciept mail back and forth.

For such extreme cases Return-Receipt-To: works just fine.

Give up.  Most people who have thought about it do not want it, and would
turn off the option anyway.  If it is important for you as a recipient to
let people know you have received it, 'r' and tell them.  If you only want
to know as a sender, then many people consider this to be snooping.

I can "export" and "append" many messages (one at a time) to a single file.

What I want to do is "export" several messages all at once, to a single file.
A 'block' of messages, if you will.

I hope that this isn't embarrassingly simple.

This will become such an nightmare, I may have to set it OFF premanently
in pine.conf.fixed atleast here.

That is when and if at all Pine *does* have that feature.

Comes here Mr. Glenn Leavell with this opinion in the "comp.mail.pine" group in
this article on 23 Jan 1995 17:35:56 GMT:

 +   1)  In INDEX mode, allow the 'k' and 'j' key to be used to move the current
 +       pointer up and down (j key would only function like this if
 +       jump short cut were turned on).  This convention can be
 +       found in vi, Elm, Gopher, and other utilities, so it makes things
 +       somewhat consistent.

While personally I wouldn't mind using h,j,k&l keys for navigation I can
almost think of all the new users stopping to use Pine if that is implemented
as one of the main reasons why they think VI is eVIl is because if h,j,k&l.

What would be nice is the use of "/" forward slash for Search instead of W,
as most of all the other utilities make use of that.

 +   2)  When reading a message with the builtin Pine pager, the spacebar
 +       scrolls the message down one page.  Add a feature such that the
 +       RETURN key can be used to scroll down one line.  This convention
 +       is used with the Unix more and less commands, as well as some
 +       other pagers.

Up and Down Arrow keys again function very well in this regard.

What would be nice is if there's an option for the user to set the default
action for Return key. One would choose Return to Page Down, while the other
would set it to Advance by one line while the third (me) would set it to
select the body of the message without the headers and print it to the attchd.
printer. Basically what I'm driving at is "user defined key" macros.

 +   3)  Add a special Quit-type command that will exit Pine without making
 +       any changes to the current folder.  For example, when this command
 +       is used, all messages marked for deletion will NOT be deleted, and
 +       all messages that were marked as new ('N') when the folder was
 +       opened will still be marked as such when the folder is opened 
 +       the next time.

Yes, an X for eXit with an Abandon Changes to mailbox prompt will be ideal.

Again here an option for the user to set X to either eXit or Expunge,
whichever he finds useful as I for one almost never use the Expunge feature
but that doesn't mean others aren't. So to strike an balance...!

I don't know how IMAP is the best.

Pine/IMAP handle particlarly bad mailboxes of 2M+, and especially bad
15M+ mailboxex.

IMAP is virtually over SLIP lines with great latency of the resonces.

I'm not saying, that elm is better -- just, that there are either some
inherent design flaws, or sloppy implementations, or both.

Invoke Pine with the -d 0 flag to suppress Pine producing debug-level files.
Usage:

Fellow Pine Users,

I have a Linux box on my network that takes care of 
all outgoing mail using Sendmail.  However, when
I run the Windows version of Pegasus, and if  you're
not root, you cannot fetch your messages.  I says:
"Invalid Password" even when I know it is correct.
This may have something to do with the fact that when I 
bring up Pine on the Linux box,  there is a message
that "Can't open folder lock"and that it is readonly.

Thank you in advance for and light shed on this
predicament.

Roger Wolcott

I said "best kept secret"... but anyway, I don't know of anything else 
that provides equivalent functionality.

If this comment is in comparison to POP, then the following comment applies:
IMAP is a functional superset of POP, therefore it can do anything that 
POP can do, plus many things POP cannot do.

I suspect this observation is largely a question of mailbox format rather
than access protocol.  If you use the CMU Cyrus server, with its highly
tuned (but incompatible with most mail tools) mailbox format, you would
have a very different comment.  (By the way, we know that Pine 3.91 on
Suns and a few other platforms has a performance bug when *opening* Bky
mbox format mailboxes.)

If you compare different access methods, e.g. IMAP, POP, NFS, they all 
have different performance characteristics.  In general I find IMAP 
preferable to the others both in terms of functionality and performance 
profile, but I look forward to when we will have a speedier mailbox 
format available.  (Tenex format is usually better than Bky mbox, but
there is still room for significant improvement.)
 
> IMAP is virtually over SLIP lines with great latency of the resonces.

"is virtually... " what?

I've used it over SLIP/PPP without complaint, but not often with 15MB 
mailboxes :)

Again, the dialup performance depends upon several implementation issues,
including your SLIP parameters.  In addition, IMAP4 has a number of
additions to permit more efficient access over slow links.

There is sometimes a price to be paid for compatibility with other 
tools.  If you can use a mailbox format that other tools do not 
understand, you can make things go much faster.

Anyone having success with dialing into an internet site using a Mac 7100
and a hayes compatible modem to emulate the VT100/102 keyboard and use
Pine? I've tried it with the ClarisWorks comm package and the Mac Comm  
Center software that came with the modem.

I have ^G, ^C, ^X, and ^T working. The cursor pad, delete, and some
others don't. Also, the screen doesn't always clear, particularly when going 
from the menu to the inbox folder index.

Thanks,

Message-Id: <vzvzD2w73C.1M9@netcom.com>
Date: Tue, 24 Jan 1995 04:28:24 GMT


Recently, I have been trying to setup Pine here at Netcom and have run
into a problem:

Some users are reporting that pine doesn't see their INBOX'es.
The inboxes are located at $HOME/.mailbox/inbox.
This is unlike the unix standard /usr/local/spool/mail/$USER (or whatever).
I searched through the makefile and could not see any reference to this.
I did not want to modify the source code since I might not change the right
things.  So I tried to make a general config file.

I made the file setting "inbox-path=" line to whatever I need.
Then i try to execute the following script:

---
#!/bin/sh
#
# Script to launch pine

exec /u3/vzvz/pub/pine/pine -P /u3/vzvz/pub/pine/pine.conf $*
	
---
This gives me the following:

{The pine main menu screen}
[Opening "INBOX"...]
Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.

I don't understand why this wouldn't work.  Also if someone could help
with what source code I should change.  I am also interested in what
pine looks to to find INBOX.  So far, i have found that if we set
the $MAIL variable it works.  Even though the MAIL thing is OK I would
like to figure out something in the sense of getting a general config file.

Thanks for all your help! and a great product too!

You can filter mail with a separate program, like procmail or filter, 
which may be onn your machine.  Look around for Nancy McGough's excellent 
filtering faq.  I only have a print copy, but it is at her WWW site, 
which you can get from her signature.

I had tried this but it didn't work.  However, another kind soul (who I
would name but I already deleted the message) mailed me that I needed
to go in Setup and enable the aggregrate-command-set.  I did and the
above sequence works fine now.  

Thought I would share it on the list in case another lost soul is
confused as to why it won't work for them.

I used Telix for Windows on a PC and had similar problem.  ^X, ^C and 
another few control codes worked, but not the cursor keys.  I emailed the 
people at TFW and they said they had no idea.  Procomm Plus for Windows 
works fine, though.  Any idea?  Thank you.

I was wondering is it possible to create a mailing list with Pine, where 
everyone in the list can mail? I mean I created a list for our demo group 
with address books command S CreateList... but I don't know how other 
members could mail into it?

We have Pine v.3.87 

I hope someone could help us? Thanks in advance

Here's an excerpt of the Pine FAQ about this.

------------
Subject: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers
by typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration
menu and set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the
cursor in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Note that customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

	The PMDF people (InnoSoft, is the company) are red-hot
	e-mail gurus. I can only assume they took 3.89 or whatever
	and worked it over into something robust.

	Yehavi@vms.huji.ac.il is the guy who's been porting to VMS.
	The HUJI port is simply like the rest of the net - he's
	trying to take the unix-oriented internet releases PINE
	and fit it into VMS.
	I've pointed out various things I've found, and the guy
	will probably look at it if/when he gets a chance.
	(just like the rest of us, he has real job :-})

> I am just starting to investigate the HUJI port.  I acquired

	Yes, it'll compile cleanly. (the build script was still
	slightly yukko, but it's no big deal to fix up, and in 99% of
	cases it'll work straight out of the box)

	The NETLIB suite would probably be a good idea, yes?
	(that would mean it would work with any TCP/IP suite
	under VMS). I suppose if you (or anyone else) is fiddling
	with VMSisms, that'd be something to target.

	There are a number of 'gotchas', and Yehavi already knows
	about some of them. If you can fix them, then it saves
	him doing it :-) I suppose you could post to the net,
	or refer them to Yehavi directly. (but hey, if the PINE
	people see VMS patches, maybe they'll get integrated
	more readily in future versions, no?)
  
> What makes it think I have a postponed mail?

	I don't know - the PINE hackers here may be able to
	tell you, though :-)
  
> Also, can someone explain just what it means under 1. in "Restrictions"?

	No idea, but at least people are aware that VMS users are
	using it. My PINE users are swooning over it, despite the
	problems they've encountered.

	(one of the annoying ones is the ^C handling leaves a fair
	bit to be desired.. seems like it gets lost sometimes...)

	PINE continues to develop - so.. it's a Good Thing!

	Luke.

Is it possible to do a TakeAddr but add the address to a distribution

I find the easies thing to do is assume that it has been read within a
reasonable time after delivery -- just like paper inter-office mail.
I hold them responsible and act accordingly.  It would be a nice safety
feature (for them) if I knew it had/had not been read, but they are
responsible.  It will happen as it seems to be a feature in most pc email
systems.  I'd certainly rather bet my job on email than US Mail.

Hmm ... 

Looks like PINE is hiding my domain name in the header of my messages.  
It's coming over as 'bill@gilroy' instead of 'bill@rmp.com' like I 
wanted. 

Any idea how this happened?

With tin, set the NNTPSERVER environment variable to the new news server

Was it really necessary to crosspost to so many groups? I'd suggest not.
In that case, add to answer to (3), above.

If I set the LINES var to indicate more/less lines (ie: export LINES=30) 
pine seems to know this but pico goes back to the regular 24 lines page. 
My question, to those who have tried this, is how do I get pico to also 
acknowledge the new LINES variable? Thanx!...laters....

Has the IMAP4 specification been release yet? If so, can someone point me

Subject: My problems with the HUJI PINE 3.91 for VMS.
Message-Id: <D39y48.3wJ@acsu.buffalo.edu>
Date: Tue, 31 Jan 1995 14:40:56 GMT


Maybe some of these problems have been reported (or even hopefully fixed),
but here goes.

These are my notes in building/using PINE/PICO 3.91:

Everything built "OK" under Multinet (just ignored the few 'undefined'
messages).

BUGS:

PINE

  - When you get a message broadcast the line on the screen where the 
    broadcast is gets erased

  - Screen layout forces certain lines to wrap, such as the words (local)
    and (remote) on the Folders screen.

  - In response to answering "yes" to the message:

       Folder "sent-mail" in <[]> doesn't exist. Create?

    I receive the following error message:

       Can't create mailbox sent-mail: mailbox already exists]

  - eXpunge from INBOX goives the following message:

       No messages expunged from folder "INBOX"

  - Replying to email puts the following line in the message of the
    reply:

      On -1 xxx -1 V080GDK3@UBVMS wrote:

    Not converting Date and Time correctly when the mail is from someone 
    on the local node.

  - Same is true when doing an 'i'ndex of a folder.  The display looks like
    this:

       +   17  Jul  7 winer@ubvms.cc.buf    (538) Business Plan
       +   18  Jul 18 winer@ubvms.cc.buf    (539) Business Plan
           19  Aug  3 Jim Gerland - Netw    (603) Invoices - OUP & NPTN
           20  Aug 18 Jim Gerland - Netw    (714) Re: Business Plan
       +   21  xxx -1 V080GDK3@UBVMS        (124)
       +   22  xxx -1 V080GDK3@UBVMS         (71)

  - Also the Subject does not show up in the above 'i'ndex listing.

  - 'C'omposing a message gives the following message:

      Continue postponed composition (answering "No" won't erase it)?

    Answering 'Y'es does not continue

  - From the Main Menu, using the 'g'o command brings up the following
    prompt:

      GOTO folder in <Incoming Message Fol> :

    and responding with: []MAIL

    gives the following message:

      [No folder opened]

  - After reading and deleting a message in []MAIL, then choosing 'm'ain,
    the 'l'ist folders, then INBOX, I received the following program abort:

      %MAIL-I-RECLPLSWAIT, reclaiming deleted file space.  Please wait... R Rename
       GetMessage header failed, status=8290642 NextPage    A Add
      %MAIL-E-ILLCTXADR, illegal context block address

========================================================================

PICO

  - Prompts at bottom of screen on exit, read file, and confirm don't appear

  - Highlighted prompts start in column 80 and wrap to next line.

========================================================================

Migration Notes (collected while testing HUJI PINE 3.91 after using the 
  PMDF PINE 3.89:

  - PINERC.PINE needs to be renamed to .PINERC
  - PINE.ADDRESSBOOK needs to be renamed to .ADDRESSBOOK
  - XX.NEWSRC needs to be renamed to .NEWSRC
  - PRINT needs to be set in .pinerc
  - Default saved messages folder needs to be set to = (nothing)

Hi Ya'll,

I have Pine running on a VMS system.  Works fine as long as you have
an existing MAIL.MAI file.  If you are a new VMS user who has does not have 
a MAIL.MAI file and then invokes PINE,...., craaassssshhh.  It dumps its
stack because no MAIL.MAI file is found.  
Does anybody have a workaround for this?  Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Ian

Yes... The current docs that have been published are RFC-1730 thru 1733,
available from all the usual Internet RFC repositories or from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the /mail directory.

I admit these files could be useful, but they clutter up my dir listing. 
Is there a way to redirect them to a folder?

Hi all,

I have several entries in my addressbook whose fcc's aren't sent-mail. 
When I use the (C)ompose command to send a new message, the out-going mail
is correctly copied to the corresponding fcc.  But if I use the (R)eply
command to reply messages FROM these people, the out-going messages will
still go to sent-mail, which is not what I want.  I have to manually edit
the header everytime and I find this really troublesome.  Is there a way
to get things work (I'm using Pine 3.91)?  Or will Pine 3.92(?) checks the
addresses of all out-going mails, compare them with the entries in
addressbook and copy them to the correct folders?  Thank you.

I've gotten that on occasion when I've had a suspended instance of Pine 
running that I forgot about.  The new Pine asks the old one for the lock, 
but the old one is suspended so it can't reply; hence the new Pine can't 
get the lock.  You might try

  $ ps -auxww | grep pine | grep yourname

where "yourname" is your username to see if there are any other Pine jobs 
running in your account.

Thanks,

Mike

Sorry for the dumb question but I have to ask since I do not know enough
about nntp and how Pine interacts with nntp.  But in Pine how do you mark
articles as being read?  Do you mark them for deletion then expunge the
folder?  Does this really delete the article from the nntp server disk or
does just mark the article as being read in the local user's .newsrc ??

I posted a message awhile back asking for help with Pine not giving a fully 
qualified domain name in the 'From:' field of an outgoing message.  I 
received e-mail From: Barry Cornelius <Barry.Cornelius@durham.ac.uk>

In his message Mr. Cornelius related his experience with the 
'gethostbyname' function of SunOS 5.3 (a part of Solaris 2.3) not 
returning a FQDN.

This turned out to be the case on our system as well.  I then patched the 
appropriate routines in the Pine code.  It still didn't work.  As a last 
resort I changed the 'user-domain' field in my local '.pinerc'.  I had 
obtained the desired result.

My understanding is that the settings in the 'pine.conf.fixed' file 
over-ride both the 'pine.conf' and the '.pinerc' settings.

The 'user-domain' field was set in the 'pine.conf.fixed' file.  In fact 
that is when all this started.  My question is has anyone else had this 
problem?  Pine is working very well for us but I am curious as to why 
this is happening?

Pine 3.05 on AIX 3.2.5.   Several students at our institution are changing 
the FROM line in their outgoing mail.   For some reason, the sender line is 
not showing up either.   They are changing the address to GOD@UNIVERSE.
Needless to say, the teacher who is receiving most of the mail is curious who 
God really is.  Is there a way to insure that the sender will be correctly 
identified.  Thanks in advance.

In later versions (we're up to 3.91 now I think), there IS no FROM line 
handed to you, and there is greater control for the system adminstrator.

We have the following set in pine.conf.fixed, and it seems to do the job:-

no-enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
no-always-use-alt-editor,
no-enable-alternate-editor-implicitly,

I don't know if this is in the documentation or in a FAQ, but I've found 
a way to crash Pine (I've tried v3.89 and v3.91).

A few users and I were able to crash Pine by simply changing the 
capitalization of the first letter of an address book nickname.  We're 
running SunOS 4.1.3_U1 and 4.1.4.  

Is this a documented thing?

When new mail arrives Pine will inform me by beeping and listing pertinent
information near the bottom of the screen.  However, since I have
configured the program to sort letters by date, the first message is
almost immediately overwritten by a rather useless confirmation that the
mail box has indeed been sorted.  It seems the two pieces of information do
not have the same level of interest.  Any way I can get rid of the latter? 

(Pine 3.91 under SunOS 4.1)

Apart from this minor problem it is a brilliant program.

I have set the signature-at-bottom in my Configuration Setup and
have experienced the following:

1) When Replying to an email message while including the original
   text, the signature file gets appended to the end of the
   email.

2) When Forwarding an email to another destination, the signature
   file gets placed BEFORE the included text, instead of at the
   bottom of the entire email message.

Is this the normal operation of "signature-at-bottom" or is this
a bug?

I have a Sparc 2 running Solaris 2.3, the IMAP binary from
cac.washington.edu and Pine 3.91 (works great).  I am using it as a server
for PC-Pine (workstations running WFW 3.11, MS TCP/IP 32 stack) but
PC-Pine likes to give me trouble.  What happens with the PC-Pine is I can
usually (not always though) connect to the server and open the INBOX. 
Then, when I go to read messages, the system freezes (well, Pine, not the
whole system) and after every 15 secs or so, I get a "no reply from server
for x seconds" and after a minute or so, I can break the IMAP connection. 
This is a very consistent problem, thogh when/where it shows up is
somewhat random.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this
problem, please let me know.

   Yes, I use it regularly.  But, it only goes to the next new/unread
   message.  Several new Pine users here have mentioned to me that they
   would like to be able to quickly be able to get to the next message
   that has not been marked for deletion.  Maybe that's being too picky,
   though.

With the delete-skips-deleted feature selected, the above task can be
performed in 1 to 2 keypresses: Just press N to advance to the very next
message.  If it's marked for deletion (check the upper right corner),
press D and you're there; otherwise you're _already_ there.

from Pine main menu, go into setup, then into configuration.  On the 
first page of the config stuff, enter news.gmu.edu where it asks for news 
server (nntp-site).  exit all the way out of pine, then go back in and 
look at your folder lists.  this will pull in all of the news groups, so 
you'll have to go and unsubscribe to any you've already unsubscribed to 
in tin.  Also, they'll be listed in alpha order.  I'm still working on 
how to rearrange the order they're listed in ... if anyone knows, feel 
free (please!) to fill me in.

procmail doesn't care what reader you use. You just have to set the 
variable MAILDIR to point at your mail directory (which in the case of 
pine is $HOME/mail). And besides, a simple procmail recipe doesn't sort 
mail to inboxes but to folders.

Subject: PICO & SPELL checker
Date: 24 Jan 1995 18:29:06 GMT
Message-Id: <3g3gti$d38@news.halcyon.com>

For some time now I've been frustrated by the spell checker in PICO. I 
use a lot of words that are not in SPELL's default dictionary and wanted 
a better way of bypassing these words than pressing the space bar. After 
some digging I've come up with the following. If it's already common 
knowledge pardon the redundancy. If it's not it might make life a bit 
easier. BTW - I tried ISPELL as a substitute for SPELL but found it klunky 
and confusing.

The following works for those who use PICO as their default editor and 
SPELL as their spell checker. I haven't checked this for other editors.

To create a custom dictionary for SPELL:
- Two files will be created in your HOME directory:

  1 - New words; an ascii file - sorted one word per line - caps 
      don't seem to matter (I named mine .newwords).

  2 - New dictionary; a hashed file (I named mine .newhlista).

- From the UNIX prompt key: 
  cat .newwords | spellin /usr/dict/hlista > .newhlista
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  (The above creates a new custom dictionary.)

  cat .newwords | spellout .newhlista
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  (The above compares new words to words in custom dictionary.)

- Edit your .login file to include:
  setenv SPELL 'spell -d .newhlista'
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Logoff & log back into the system to enable changes made to .login 
environment variables. Now when you use the ^T within PICO SPELL will 
check for your custom dictionary as specified in .login file.

Hope this helps,

Read receipts are a common enough question among my users that I have a
standard reply.  The hint in the last paragraph is much more reliable
than any automatic mechanism ever will be.  Automated read receipts do
not tell you whether your message was read by the user, only if it was
read by his software.

   There is currently no universal mechanism for getting verification
   of email delivery.  One method that almost works is to include a
   header in your message:

	Return-Receipt-To: username@rahul.net

   IF the recipient's system uses 'sendmail' for mail transport, it
   will send back an automated reply saying it received the message.
   But it doesn't guarantee that it reached the recipient's mailbox,
   only that it reached the recipient's host.

   A requirement to get confirmation of mail actually being read by the
   recipient is that sending and receiving hosts have a common protocol
   for this.  This is not the case on the Internet, as sites are
   autonomous and use a variety of software.  The chances of it
   happening in the future is also small:  many people consider it a
   violation of their privacy.

   The best way to find out if somebody read your mail is to send a
   brief follow-up message saying "Hi, I was just wondering if my
   previous message reached...I can't tell if my email is getting
   out."  This will usually result in a quick reply.

Are you sure they are actually doing it with Pine?  There is a very easy hack
to send fake mail that has nothing to do with Pine.  I seem to remember that
you could play some games with postponed messages too.  The current Pine 3.91
release should do a better job of identifying outgoing mail, but there is
only so much we can do... :(

Use Delete and eXpunge.  It does not actually delete the messages and you 
can get them back with '&'.

in this article on 31 Jan 1995 16:22:13 -0800:

 +   I have set the signature-at-bottom in my Configuration Setup and
 +   have experienced the following:

 +   1) When Replying to an email message while including the original
 +      text, the signature file gets appended to the end of the
 +      email.

 +   2) When Forwarding an email to another destination, the signature
 +      file gets placed BEFORE the included text, instead of at the
 +      bottom of the entire email message.

 +   Is this the normal operation of "signature-at-bottom" or is this
 +   a bug?

No it is not a bug. Here's the order..

For Reply, the order is reply-header, quoted text, your response and then your
sig

For Forward, the order is your quick_note, your .sig, reply-header, quoted text,quoted .sig

Howdy y'all,

Is it possible to somehow have a random signature (out of a directory of

to get pine to run a program that would output such a random sig?

Thanks!

Mike,

My solution is brute force rather than automated, but it works. I don't 
always use a .signature file, and like to jump between several of them 
based on the phase of the moon, Clinton's haircut, and various other 
considerations. See below for one example (and a spell-check nightmare).

Rename your .signature file to my-sig or whatever, write your message, 
spell check it (too few folks do this!), use ^R ^T S to select the file 
you want to use as a signature, and bang away!

There are probably more elegant solutions, including spell-checking a 
text-based .signature file before saving it in the first place.

I downloaded the version for HP-UX9, because this is the operating system we
are running, so now I have this file pico-bin.hpux9 and I don't know what 
to do with it now.  I am not very unix literate, although I know it enoough 
that I feel comfortable using it.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in 
advance.

Ok ... I finally got pine, and I've been playing around with it, and I 
suddenly realize that the cursor keys on our Wyse60 terminals are not 
working inside Pine ... 

It looks like the cursor keys send ^K, ^J, ^H, and ^L, which Pine uses
for other purposes.  Is there a way to remap these keys inside Pine, or 
do I initialize the terminal to a different type going in??? 

Anybody ever run into this?
