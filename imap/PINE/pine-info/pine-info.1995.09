This is very cool - thanks for telling us about this!

It would be great if the Pine FAQ were also regularly crossposted
to comp.mail.pine,comp.answers,news.answers so that it would get
archived on all the FAQ archive servers like rtfm.mit.edu, etc.
FYI, I have lots of info about FAQ archives at:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/faqs.html

Thanks,
Nancy

Does this mean the problem lies with the IMAP server (in whole or in
part)? I'm happy to recompile Pine (in the prescence of the 3.6 toolkit)
but the IMAP server is from PMDF running on a VAX (VMS) over which I 
have no control.

The PMDF server may have the same bug.  I don't know.

The error message from Pine comes out when strlen() of the header in CRLF form
plus strlen() of the text in CRLF form is not equal to the reported RFC 822
message size.

This is not a very good check for other reasons (it breaks on NULs in the
message).  When Pine uses the imap-4 toolkit it won't depend upon strlen().

    Pine itself will not do this for you.  You have to use some other 
facility, which will depend on what kind of system you are on.  IF you 
are on a Unix(-like) system, there is a 'vacation' command, or you can be 
more elaborate and use a program like procmail.

Subject: Is it possible to force user-id to be identical to username login ?
Status: O
X-Status: 

I am testing PCPINE 3.91 (both Win and DOS versions) with a IMAP Unix server.
What it seems strange to me is that a PCPINE user can change his/her "user-id
for From address"  so that there is no relationship between his/her username
(checked by the server when he/she opens the remote INBOX folder) and 
a completely different user-id written in the From line.
So I can login as "bottasini" (my username on the Unix server) and send
messages with "rossi" (the name of the big boss) in the "From" line !
Is it possible to force the "From" user-id to be identical to login username ?
Thanks

Is it possible to have a command executed when all new mail has been seen. 
For example, when all new mail has been seen, I wan't Pine to execute 'cat
/dev/null > .newmail' so that my mail notification is turned off.  I use
an imap server so when I get new mail, I use procmail to put something in
this file.  When I start up Pine, I zero this file, so my mail notification
works.  While in Pine if I get new mail and read it all, I want to zero
this file so my mail notification goes out. 

Or is there a program to monitor the imap server to know when you have
read all your mail?


Thanks for any help.

I hope not!!  And the reason I say this, is because when I joined the 
wonderful world of e-mail a couple of months ago, our admin asked me 
to complete a form before they would give me a login.  The form asked for 
*all* of my names and innocently I wrote them in.  I was not then best 
pleased when *all* of my names kept appearing on messages!  (I did 
beg and plead with admin. but they were adamant that my login would 
have to use all my names, even though I have a fairly unusual 
surname.)  Luckily I discovered that you could alter the "From" user-id 
and now hopefully you will be receiving this message from *plain*
[ :-) ]

I use metamail.  I don't remember where I got it.  Maybe sunsite.unc.edu??

Does anyone know why many of my mail messages and posts using Pine have
a "=20" at the end of many of the lines.  I use the PICO editor to
include files.  The "=20"'s only appear after the files that I send are
received by the sendee or newsgroup.

Thanks for your assistance.

I've got a problem that noone has been able to help me with.

At some point, a message I was composing got interrupted.  Now, when I hit "C"
to compose a new message, I get "Continue interrupted composition..."

If I hit "Y" I get an error beep and "Empty folder.  No messages really
postponed!"  I can't figure out how to clear that interrupted message out so
that pine doesn't think it's waiting for me to finish it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This isn't a function of Pine. Pine is a Mail User Agent (MUA). That
means it's basic funtion in life is to read and send mail. It doesn't
do anything like respond, filter, or anything like that to mail. The
Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) or an external program is used for
that. What you are probably looking for is something like procmail.

Your Unix shell should provide that via the "~/.forward" file. See
aliases(4) for more info.

If you look closely at the "forged" message (in full-headers mode),
you should see an X-sender: header that corresponds to the login that
was used to open INBOX on the IMAP server.  It's not perfect, but it's
about the best we could come up with without breaking some other
functionality...

The =20 means that there is something in the message that triggered
Quoted-Printable encoding.  The =20 itself is a space at the end of a
line and will not trigger encoding, but there should be some other =xx
in the message that did.  Possible triggers include any single line
over 1000 characters, or one or more 8bit characters somewhere in the
message.

This is a bug in Pine 3.91 (that will be fixed in 3.92).  To get rid
of the message, delete the ".pine-interrupted-mail" file from your

Subject: Pine address book enhancement request 

Hi Portia,

	Hope things are going well for you.

	I have a request for an enhancement to the Pine address book. 
Right now when you create a list in the personal address book, you don't 
have any method of getting to the global address book for 
selecting/verifying names, addresses, etc.

	Would it be possible to add the ^T function as a menu option when 
creating lists in the personal address book?

	Thanks for your consideration of this request.

	Have a nice weekend!

Mickey

 Also, I would like to know if it's possible to have Pine download an 
entire newsgroup (or more), to be read offline. (Or can this feature be 
added)

 Any way to reconfigure assigned keys in Pine?

Both QModemPro for Win, and Telix for Win will not recognize the mark set 
keystroke of CTRL-6, and that is one I use very frequently...

Any way to re assign?

Thanks...

Is there a simple and direct way to go to the end of mail thats being 
composed in Pine (3.91) and, once there, back to the top?  What about the 
same for news being viewed with Pine?  And Pico?

I've checked the manual, FAQ, etc.  I must be missing something.  There's 
got to be a better way than paging down/up a screen at a time.

Thanks,

There is a piece of software called "vacation" (funnily enough) that
comes with most distributions of Unix.

I haven't a clue how to use it, as I've only just heard of it myself.

    When composing, press ^W^V to go to the bottom of the file.  Press 
^W^Y to go to the top of the file.  (^ refers to the Control key.)  The 
same will work when viewing a file, although you can simply press W 
rather than ^W when viewing.

Can somebody please help me by explaining how to make pine work with Cnews.

I have seen people using pine as a news agent. How is it done?

Subject: Strange delay accessing IMAPD from PINE
Date: 02 Sep 1995 17:23:21 GMT
Message-Id: <HOLMBERG.95Sep2192321@promotor.upp.promotor.telia.se>

X-Status: 


I'm using PINE 3.91 on SunOS 4.1.3.
Reading mail locally works fine. But when I try to access
a remote folder (via IMAP) a strange delay occurs.

When I select the remote folder, PINE "hangs" for about a minute,
and after that I get the username/password prompt to use on the
remote machine. Why this delay ?

The IMAPD server I'm accessing is running on a Silicon Graphics running
IRIX 5.3. The server is built from the PINE3.91 distribution.

I have watched the TCP-traffic (with "tcpdump") on the LAN where
the IMAPD server is running. Nothing arrives from the machine I'm
running PINE on until after the strange delay of about a minute.

I have also stopped PINE while it is "hanging" to see what PINE is doing.
The stack frame then looks like this:

    tcp_getdata(stream = 0x1e3038)
    tcp_getbuffer(stream = 0x1e3038, size = 1,
                  buffer = 0xefffe216 "<unprintable...>")
    map_open(stream = 0x19c920)
    mail_open(stream = 0x19c920,
              name = 0xefffeb70 "{host.with.impd.server}INBOX",
              options = 0)
    context_open(context = 0x185d88 "[]", old = (nil),
                 name = 0xefffeb70 "{host.with.impd.server}INBOX",
                 opt = 0)
    do_broach_folder(newfolder = 0x18ca00 "MM-INBOX",
                     new_context = 0x185d98)
    folder_lister(ps = 0x181910, do_what = FolderMaint,
                  start_context = (nil), return_context = (nil),
                  return_string = (nil), context_list = 0x185d98,
                  f_state = (nil))
    folder_screen(pine_state = 0x181910)
    main(argc = 1, argv = 0xeffff9a4)


I have also accessed the IMAPD server from a PINE running on the same
machine as the server. Then there is NO delay.

Can anybody help me explain what is wrong ?

Thanks,

I am testing PCPINE 3.91 (both Win and DOS versions) with a IMAP Unix server.
What it seems strange to me is that a PCPINE user can change his/her "user-id
for From address"  so that there is no relationship between his/her username
(checked by the server when he/she opens the remote INBOX folder) and 
a completely different user-id written in the From line.
So I can login as "bottasini" (my username on the Unix server) and send
messages with "rossi" (the name of the big boss) in the "From" line !
Is it possible to force the "From" user-id to be identical to login username ?
Thanks

I noticed the same problem a month ago.  The suggested answer at that time
was to put :143 in the inbox-path command in the pine configuration file.

The line looks similar to

inbox-path=3D{hostname:143}

Hope this helps

In a pinch, I used PGP under DOS to decode it once.  I prettied it up

Just something to keep in mind.

Hi everyone!

A short question here, I am trying to read my mail which is held on a 
different machine. From my Linux system at home I simply change the 
mail_box location to point to the other machine (this is in the pine 
.pinerc configuration file). I am connected to the other network using 
PPP, it seems Pine correctly goes to that other system, but the next 
thing I get even before any folders are open is the following error message:

IMAP connection broken on reply

I searched through the FAQ but couldn't find anything. Am I simply 
missing some little configuration detail, or is there a problem with the 
protocol the mail_server machine is using (it is using IMAP2bis BTW).

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

  It's in the Makefile - take out the "-DDEBUG".

You use the "Attachments:" line to attach binaries to an email
document. It will attach them in MIME-format.

Move your cursor to this line, then press ^T to go to the files, then
read the instructions on the bottom of the screen.

I don't recommend you attach anything past about 1Mb. Even that's
prolly too much.

I just pulled the latest Pine release for Windows
from www.washington.edu. I'm off to a real good start,
but for some strange reason all of the Mail-folders
that I am able to generate indexes for come up
read-only. So I cannot delete messages, etc.

The mail-folder is local to the PC, I am just trying
to get setup for an off-line reader at this point.

Any clues would be greatly appreciated.

it has over a 1000 messages.  I can't read all those, I want to start 
with todays messages and go from there...how do I do that?  Rather than 
going through and deleteing every message until I am current.  I am using 
PINE 3.91.
	Any Help is greatly loved...Thanks in advance.

It does not require much modifications.  A patch follows.  If anobody
has trouble with the patch, let me know.  The patch also includes a
fix for imapd.  I don't know about other architectures but on Solaris
2.4 (probably 2.x), inetd seems to give non-blocking sockets to the
deamons it starts. Imapd therefore never stops while waiting for a
command and sucks up all the CPU power. :-( The solution is to force
stdin to be blocking.

Content-Description: What is Pine?

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of power users as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, and NNTP) and runs on Unix, MS-DOS, and
MS Windows. 
  
The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful limitation
of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present command
menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user mistakes.  It
is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather than reading
manuals.  It has the ability to perform full screen editing of messages,
include and extract attachments (such as Word or Excel files), and other
advanced message system features. 

Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and MIME
for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to normal
messages.

Content-Description: What is MIME?

MIME (RFC1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It is
an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
(word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between any
compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME from the
RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that
is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime, comp.answers and news.answers. 
If you have a Web browser you can access it through:

Content-Description: What is IMAP?

IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client program
on any platform at any location on the Internet can access email folders
on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be local, they reside on
the server until the client explicitly moves or deletes them.  The IMAP
protocol is a functional (but incompatible) superset of POP. A principal
advantage of IMAP over POP is that it permits using more than one computer
to access your mail.  Using multiple computers with POP typically results
in your mail ending up scattered across all of those computers. Another
key advantage is IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages,
e.g. you don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved
until you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see the
paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP vs. POP." 
It is available from: 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.vs.pop
  
IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email on a
remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or departmental). 
The current IMAP4 Proposed Standard is described in RFC1730.  Additional
information is included in RFC1731, RFC1732, and RFC1733.

Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is bi-directionally
gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear

Content-Description: How many sites use Pine?

Based on the number of people getting copies of Pine and its
documentation, we know for sure that Pine is used at over 12,000 sites in
60 different countries.  We do not have any way to count the exact number
of sites using Pine or the total number of users, but we estimate that 
well over one million people use Pine right now (12/94).  People are still
jumping on the Pine bandwagon -- about 4,000 new users each day -- so any
guess about the number of people who use Pine today will surely be too
small tomorrow.

compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other people's
INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in the default

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine and Pico?

If you use ispell and have an ispell custom dictionary (usually ispell.words
or .ispell_words in your home directory, which contains a list of words, one 
word to a line) then it is nice to also use ispell for spell checking your 
outgoing mail messages.  There are two methods for setting this up.  

METHOD 1
========
If you always use Pine's default composer, Pico, then you can use ispell
as your "alternate editor."  In your .pinerc set enable-alternate-editor
and set the editor variable like this:

   editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell

(See step 1 of Method 2 below for instruction for finding the full path
to ispell on your machine.)

Then, when you are composing a message you can type ^_ to run ispell on your 
message and display the output in Pine's viewer.  In the viewer you can use
ispell's usual commands. While in ispell you can type ? for help on  ipell's 
commands.  One useful command is ``I'' which inserts the current word in your 
custom dictionary.


METHOD 2
========
If you use an alternate editor, such as vi or emacs, then you need to fool 
Pine into thinking that ispell is spell.  Here's how to set this up:

1] Determine what directory ispell is in by using one of these commands:

     which ispell
     type ispell
     whereis ispell
     where ispell

2] In your bin directory, e.g., $HOME/bin, link spell to ispell with:

     ln -s /usr/local/bin/ispell $HOME/bin/spell

   Replace ``/usr/local/bin'' with ispell's path (see #1).


3] If you use the csh or tcsh set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .cshrc:

     setenv SPELL "$HOME/bin/spell"

   If you use the Bourne shell set the SPELL environment variable by
   putting a line like this in your .profile:

     SPELL="$HOME/bin/spell"
     export SPELL

4] In your home directory create a file called ispell.words that
   contains your private dictionary of words that should pass the
   spell check.  This will probably include your name, email address, etc.

5] Logout and log back in to make sure that your new settings are in
   place.

6] Test that this is set up correctly by using Pine to compose a message
   and include words, like your name,  that are in your custom dictionary.  
   Spellcheck the message with ^T.  If your name passes the spellcheck (and
   your name isn't in regular dictionaries) then it is set up correctly.

With Method 2 you cannot use many of ispell's features, for example, ``I'',
which inserts a word in your dictionary doesn't work.

Using your favorite text editor (e.g. Pico), create a file in your home

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
programs, such as "procmail" or "filter" or "deliver" or "mailagent." 
   
Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "procmail"
program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX. 
   
So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created?

One solution is to just access them the same way you access your other
mail folders.  If they are in your default folder directory (usually
$HOME/mail) then just type L to list your folders and select the folder
you'd like to view.  If they are in a different directory, for example
$HOME/mail/IN, add that directory to your folder-collections by putting
this into your .pinerc: 

folder-collections=mail/[],
        mail/IN/[],

And then when you list your folders by typing L the mail/IN directory will
be in your list. 

Another solution is to use Pine's incoming-folders variable.  With this
method you can use the Tab key to tab through new messages in all your
incoming folders.  When you are at the last new message in one incoming
folder pressing the Tab key will move you to the next incoming folder with
a new message. 

Here is part of a sample .pinerc for setting up incoming folders: 
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}IN/Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class into
the folder "IN/art151" and mail relating to the Art-L mailing list into
"IN/Art-L". 
   
>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders.
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't forget that you have more than one
place to look for new mail. 
   
For a more detailed treatment of filtering, see the Filtering Mail FAQ and
the Procmail FAQ.  The hypertext version of these are available at:

Content-Description: How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?

                                       

In Pine 3.90, and later versions, you can set Reply-To, Organization,
and other headers using the customized-hdrs variable.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the value of the customized-hdrs variable:
   a) To use the Where command type: w
   b) At the prompt type: customized-hdrs
   c) To Add a value type: a
   d) At the prompt type: Organization: Your Organization Name
   e) Repeat steps c and d for other headers such ast Reply-To

   Note that Pine understands environment variables so you
   can use lines like the following (if the variables are set):
      Organization: $ORGANIZATION
      Reply-To: $REPLYTO

While reading a message that you've received you can view all headers by 
typing h.  If h does not work you need to go to your configuration menu and 
set the enable-full-header-cmd variable.

While composing a message you can view all the headers by placing the cursor
in the header region and typing ^R (view rich headers).

Customized headers are not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier.

following: 

        tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

You could also write a script, maybe called unrot, that does this and then
pipe the message to the script. 

In order for the pipe command to work you need to be using Pine 3.90 or 
higher and have the enable-unix-pipe-cmd variable set.

Content-Description: Can I eliminate the @host.domain from local addresses?

This is not a new idea.  It's a very old idea, in fact, and just about
everyone who has ever dealt with email has had it at one time or another. 
Regretably, it has come to be recognized as a bad idea.  Here's why: 

An email address without a host name is not syntactically valid according
to RFC822.  Now, it is true that RFC822 only specifies what must be done
in messages which are transmitted over the network, and that strictly
local messages are not under RFC822's dictates. 

This means that there are two formats of email, one that conforms to
RFC822 and one that does not.  Careful efforts must be made to ensure that
the non-conforming mail format never escapes the local system onto the
network. Twenty years' of experience has shown that it is impossible to
guarantee that the non-conforming format does not escape into the network,
even in the face of traps to catch such messages on their way out and
convert them to RFC822 conforming format.  Indeed, such traps have often
contributed additional problems on their own. 

The non-conforming format is ambiguous as to what host is intended.
Although the off-the-cuff solution (and the one that everyone implements)
is ``use the local host'', numerous examples have occurred in which this
leads to wrong behavior.  For example, it may be the ``local mail center''
instead of the ``local machine which is a single-user workstation''.  Or,
if a one of the non-conforming messages escaped on to the network, it's
some remote system and we have no idea at all what system that may be! 
There's no way for the mail reader to tell; a human may infer from context
but often does so by using information that is not available to the
program. 

The Pine team has spent long (and at times heated) meetings reviewing this
issue, before coming to the conclusion (as other email groups have
independently done) that it's a no-win situation.  The policy of the email
development community for 15 years (since the RFC733 discussions) has been
to exterminate the non-conforming format by not implementing it in modern
mail tools. 

It may be feasible to implement a feature in a future version of Pine that
would suppress the display of the local host name in email addresses. That
is, the host name would still be in the file on disk, but would not show
up on the screen.  We'll consider it, but we have a large list of very
high priority tasks which must be done first.

Content-Description:  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication software
you are using to interpret certain special characater sequences that tell
it to divert the incoming stream of characters to your printer, and then
back to your screen.  Perhaps 99% of "pine printing problems" are either
due to PC or Mac communications software that doesn't understand ANSI
escape sequences for printing, *or* (in the dialin case) softare flow-
control problems. 

We didn't understand how big a problem software flow control was 
until 3.90 came out... we changed pine to intercept flow control 
characters so that users would not see Pine "wedge" mysteriously if a 
mis-type or noise generated a control-S, but that did bad things when 
printers, modems, or comm software was depending on s/w flow control.

So in 3.91 we added the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature, so that
Pine could be configured to respect s/w flow control characters (if the
operating system did) for those folks who needed them.  Enabling this feature
should make Pine 3.91 behave the same way as earlier versions. 

Then we discovered that some operating systems don't enable software flow
control by default.  So in 3.92, the "preserve-start-stop-characters" 
feature will do more than simply "not ignoring" them, it will try to force
the OS to pay attention to them.

So here's the sequence of things to try if you have pine printing 
problems:

 1. CHECK FOR SOFTWARE FLOW-CONTROL PROBLEMS:
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters"  <- requires 3.91
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global 
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does 
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS 
       will not be needed in 3.92).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. CHECK YOUR COMM SOFTWARE FOR ANSI PRINTING CAPABILITY
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still 
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.  
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also 
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to 
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences 
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. POSSIBLE OTHER PRINTING PROBLEMS
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using 
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, 
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the 
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print 
       command option and "ansiprt".

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?


Beginning with version 3.91, it is usually sufficient to set the
nntp-server variable, via the Setup/Config menu. This will automatically 
define a default news-collection.  In case the default is not appropriate 
for your site, the following details may help...

Three ways to access news via Pine: 

    1. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]
   
       Note that if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from that same server.
       

    2. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       
           news-collections = News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]


    3. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       
           news-collections = News *[*]


The advantage of IMAP newsreading is that the same .newsrc can be used for
both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

Content-Description: Why does Pine encode text attachments?


Pine uses MIME's Base64 encoding for *all* attachments, including text, in
order to assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make
sure that sending file attachments in Pine is as dependable as using FTP.

Although it may seem like encoding is unnecessary for files that are
plain text, certain email gateway, trasport, and delivery agents pose
a threat to the integrity of even text files (much less binary files).
For example, long lines may be wrapped, trailing spaces deleted, tabs
turned into spaces, lines beginning with "From " modified, etc.
Pmay there are actually several potential sources of corruption

Content-Description: How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment?

   
Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email messages.
Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to understand Pine's attachments.

If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient needs to have either
a MIME-capable mail reader or software that can decode MIME. Fortunately,
these are not hard to find. The major proprietary mail vendors have
committed to MIME support, but some of their upgraded products are some
months away.  One freely-available program which can decipher a MIME
attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It is available at:

Content-Description: How can I send a text file without it being encoded?


This is easily done by using Pine's "file inclusion" key (Control-R).
Instead of entering the file name on the Attchmnt header line, move
the cursor to the bottom of your messaage, and press Control-R, then
enter the name of the text file.  It will be included at the end of 
your message without any encoding (unless the file contains 8bit or
binary characters, in which case the entire message becomes subject
to MIME encoding rules.)

Content-Description: Why does Pine use Base64 instead of UUENCODE?


Pine uses the Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standard for all attachments.  MIME uses "Base64" encoding rather than
uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are transformed by some
email gateways, and there are also several incompatible versions of
uuencode.  However, if needed, you can certainly uuencode a file outside
of Pine, then use the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert
the uuencoded file into the message.

Keith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu> has written a Perl conversion script to
convert Mailtool to MIME.  The Perl script and C conversion are
available in

	ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.perl.Z
	ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.c.Z

The following is from

        ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/MIME/sun-to-mime.README

This is a simple filter that takes Sun OpenWindows 3 messages as input,
and produces MIME messages as output.  It's written in perl, so you
need perl installed to run it.

As shipped, the perl program may call uudecode to undo the effects of
uuencoded files, and uuencode to convert binary files to base64 (!).
It calls "zcat" to uncompress files.  Finally, it needs a program
to convert Sun raster files to some other format (like GIF) that
MIME supports.  As supplied, it uses the "convert" program
(part of ImageMagick) to do this, but some other program or set
of programs (like the pbm stuff: "rasttopnm | ppmtogif") will also
work.  Just change the line that calls "convert" to use whatever you
have.

If you are using MH 6.8 or later with MIME support, put this in
your .mhn-profile file (or wherever $MHN points):

mhn-show-x-sun-attachment/: sun-to-mime.perl | mhn -file - -show


If you are using metamail, put this in your .mailcap file:

x-sun-attachment; sun-to-mime.perl < %s | metamail -T ; needsterminal


Enjoy!

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted" means
that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in which it
expected a start-of-message header line, it found something else. 
   
The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine. 
   
Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the problem
go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the folder and see
what is wrong with the very first line. In particular, make sure that
there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file and that the first
character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' , the second an ``r'', the
third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an INBOX, you may want to rename the
folder so that new mail can be delivered while repairs on the corrupt
folder are being done. 
   
Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g. /bin/mail)
which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the beginning of the
new data. 
   
Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail folder
without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This is a general
problem on UNIX. 
   
Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
attribute caching. 
   
Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3). If
the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to determine its
cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some external software.
The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2) and (3) is that it does
not want to risk damaging user data by guessing what is right. Pine never
writes to the folder unless it is absolutely sure it knows what it is
doing. 
   
There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance of
your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and installed Pine
on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file
at the same time. 
   
Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 
   
There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it
used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock
file as well, but this has not been directly verified. 
   
_NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are known
problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an application
beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it). All of the above
mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Content-Description: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With the
default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will get full
access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be changed to
read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not see any further
updates to that folder until it is reopened with full access. Currently
the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and restarting Pine. With the
Tenex format, any number of sessions can simultaneously have full access
to a folder, with the exception that expunging is disabled. See "What is a
Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine has
discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing your mail
folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level lock used by
programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail, and by certain
programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly, this lock is only
to be acquired and held for a very short period of time (less than a
second). 
   
It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that message
every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the time that it
will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is false -- that is,
that whatever program locked the folder forgot to unlock it (perhaps it
crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the lock for itself. 
   
This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
_NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting to
open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will trigger
this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters or less on
those systems._

Content-Description: Why doesn't Pine recognize Content-Length header field?


It would be a significant detriment to the performance of the Berkeley
format mailbox parsing code, as well as to Pine's behavior on normal
systems which do not use the Content-Length: header, if any attempt were
made to implement Content-Length:. 

There are many serious technical problems with the Content-Length: 
header, and we do not recommend its use.  Furthermore, we recommend that a
mail delivery agent such as our sendit or tmail tool be used that applies
smart quoting, as opposed to the ordinary BSD /bin/mail quoting of all
lines that begin with "From ".  We have installed such tools on all of our
systems. 

For example, one problem is that a system whose mailer does not implement
Content-Length: will also not enforce its validity should that header
appear. This offers significant potential for mischief.  Another problem
is that Berkeley format mailbox files which use the Content-Length: header
can not be edited with an editor such as emacs or vi without invalidating
the Content-Length: field.  If this problem is not a consideration at your
site, we recommend the use of the tenex format (mail.txt), which is also
length tagged but in a much more efficient fashion. 

>From our perspective, these problems outweigh any possible benefit of
supporting Content-Length: in Berkeley format mailbox files.  At the
present time there are no plans to do so.

Content-Description: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of Pine. If
you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients already, the
following information may be useful. 
  
The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication is
designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with alternative
authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of c-client
you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the name of your
port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is included by the
os_xxx.c file. 
   
The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it may
be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only contains
that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify that file and
rebuild imapd.

(wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the local machine
and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely that this model will
be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or POP as the access protocol,
in a future release.

Content-Description: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?



Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or mulitple
users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost* full
Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW access is
that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no one can do an
Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a msg as deleted)
*can* be done, and this state is preserved across sessions. 
   
If an explicit Expunge command fails, it will say so and tell you that the
mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session left
using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again. 
   
In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW client
at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session steals the
RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier session becoming
RO. 

NOTE:  Mailbox format for INBOX is a function of the mail transfer agent
(sendmail, tmail), not the mail user agent (Pine), so this is a decision
for sys/mail admins, not for regular Pine users.

In Unix and PC Pine 3.90 and higher, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the

Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide defaults file, 
a system-wide non-overridable settings file and a personal coniguration file.
If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide configuration
files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib".  If, for some reason, you need to 
generate a blank personal configuration file, run "pine -P pinerc.blank".

You have several options:

       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Some AIX distributions apparently include a compiler that does not

think that Pine 3.90 works around the problems but it is difficult for us
to confirm this since there is considerable variation among AIX systems.
We have also not been able to identify a particular version or patch of
AIX or the compiler that is the culprit.

Content-Description: I cannot compile under SCO unix, why not?


Pine has been tested and compiles just fine on a suitably equipped SCO
Unix 3.2.4, and probably works on the whole 3.2 series (testing has not
been as extensive).  It handles both MMDF and sendmail mailboxes without
needing recompilation.  It should be sufficient just to unpack the source
tree and run "sh build sco" at the top level.  You need to own the
complete Development System, and the Developer's Versions of the other
packages.  Pine will not compile without TCP/IP support. 

The most common problem is when people own the Development System, but
keep getting missing header files (netbd.h is one) in their builds.  This
is a common problem on SCO systems because of the great fragmentation SCO
enjoys in the marketing of system components.  It is easy to get confused
about just what you've bought.  And in this case, haven't bought. What you
need is the "Developer's Version" of the TCP/IP product.  The normal
version just supports the TCP/IP protocol, but doesn't include tools
(including header files) to compile TCP/IP-specific programs.  Alas, the
only remedies available to you are to pick up a pre-compiled version (mine
is on odi.cwc.whecn.edu, ftp.celestial.com has their own, which prefers
Bezerk mailboxes, though it supports MMDF too), or to buy the Developer's
Version of TCP/IP.  If you intend to do any serious compiling of Internet-
available programs, I'd recommend the latter, though many of the most
useful ones are available precompiled on other FTP sites.

Content-Description: Why should I use the builtin Bug Report command?

Using the built-in Bug Report command (B on the Main Menu or any Help
screen) is useful because it will automatically include configuration
information that may be essential to determining the cause of the problem
you are experiencing.  It also gives you the opportunity to conveniently
include the current message as an attachment in case you believe that 
the problem is specific to that message.

When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point that
a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't reproduce
the problem in the current version, our standard response will be to ask
you to upgrade.

We don't know right now.  3.92 is under active development, but no dates
yet.  Besides, our track-record on meeting projected release schedules is
terrible, so you shouldn't believe any dates we are foolish enough to
suggest anyway.

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Content-Description: What new features will future releases of Pine include?

The list for 3.92 is not frozen yet.  This release will have a number of
bug fixes, but it will also introduce several new features.  Some of
the things we know will be there include:

 o Fix for some pine.conf variables not working (e.g. local bug address).
 o Delete flag will no longer be preserved on Save.
 o Bky mbox format performance bug fixed.
 o Reply prompt will change if there is a Newsgroups header present.
 o Improvements in software flow-control handling.
 o Improvements in bug report command.
 o Ability to specify an alternative to the sendmail MTA.
 o Support for negotiating 8BITMIME with an ESMTP server.
 o Mouse support for use with X terminals.
 o Pull-down command menus in the Windows version.
 o Feature to disable capture of pipe command output.
 o Ability to use mailcap viewer for attachments of type TEXT.
 o Support for .mime.types file to specify attachment types.

After 3.92 is released, here are a few of the things that we plan to 
work on:

     * Additional MIME support, esp. controlling file TYPING 
     * PEM and/or PGP support 
     * External directory services access 
     * Kerberos support 
     * RFC1522 header encoding for 8bit character sets 
     * Location independence of support files 
     * Offline support 
     * Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Answered flag not set if reply is postponed (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4) 
     * Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

Sounds like metamail isn't found in the path used by PINE.
At least this answer fits 90% of the cases where this error occurs.

The answer is yes, it really does.  Accordingly I produced the appended
patch which makes pine refuse to read mailboxes larger than a megabyte.

This anser assumes you are using Pine 3.91...

First go into the Setup Configuration screen (S then C from the Main 
Menu) and make sure you have the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature 
turned on.

This adds three very useful commands to Pine's menus:

	;	Select -- selects a set of messages according to a criterion
	A	Apply  -- applies a command to the set of selected messages
	Z	Zoom   -- Zoom the index to just show selected messages

Thus the sequence to "catch-up" a newsgroup (also works for mail folders) 
is to select the messages you want to operate on (ithis case all of them) 
and then apply a "delete" command to them:

	;  A  A  D

In view of programming, I believe it is possible. However, I believe it is
not too meaningful to do so too. In SMTP, it is always easy to fake 
others' ID...

I got similar error message sometime ago too. That was due to imapd was 
not installed in my Linux server. Get a copy of imapd for Linux from 
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine. Then add it into inet.conf and 
/etc/services (143/tcp).

Hope this works.

Actually, what problem did you have? Does you ISP support imap?

Visit ftp.cac.washington.edu and go into /pine. There are a few
"ready-to-run" pico ports. See if there is one for SCO.

Hello,

I tried to compile PINE 3.91 on UNIX System V Release 4. But there seemed
to be problems with addrbook.c. pico, imapd and the imap test program
could all be successfully built, while pine couldn't. As I am not familiar
with C, I didn't understand what the problem was. 

I think sv4 should be the appropriate makefile, right? Does anyone succeed
to build pine 3.91 on this platform? 

Thanks a lot.

Davy

I had the same experience.  So, instead of typing "", I simply changed the
default Fcc folder option to a blank space and pushed return.  The set up
then showed the value <Empty value> for my default Fcc.  This works
perfectly for me.

Actually, I believe the "proper" way to suppress Fcc is to set the default
to /dev/null (on *nix).

As I try to compose a message with Pico, I get a hard return for each
space I type in, and "alpha" instead of an accentued e, "beta" for 
another accentued character.
Using the SET FONT Option for the menu bar and choosing Fixedsys instead 
of the default which is nothing, fixes the accentued character set pb but
not the space pb. The new selected font is not saved and the next time
I start Pine alphas and betas are back...
Is there any way to configure Pico? What's wrong?

Help is really appreciated.

Alternatively create an empty file "mail.txt" in the user's home
directory. When Pine finds mail in the INBOX it will move it to this
mail.txt file which is stored in Tenex format. Tenex format mail
files aren't slurped in to memory and can be modified in place without
copying the whole file - a great improvement if you are in the habit
of having dirty great messages...

There is a program called procmail which can be programmed by each user 
to redirect a user's incoming mail to different incoming folders, to 
other users, or to the bit bucket based on information in the message 
header.  

Barring getting your system administrators to install procmain and 
your setting up a procmail program script, you can use pine to quickly 
sort your incoming mail by subject, From, etc, or select by subject, 
From, etc., and then Apply Delete and eXpunge the unwanted messages.

I use the latter, not wanting to mess with procmail.

Good luck.

	In the makefile.sv4 (or whatever...) you need to add -Dconst=
to the CFLAGS= line.  That should take care of it....

	No, that is not the job of pine and should not be the job of pine
or any User Agent for that matter.

	Many Unix systems have the "vacation" program that will take care
of your needs.  Type "man vacation".  Otherwise, you can always use the
mail filter programs such as "procmail".

-- Dear Pinesters:

I would dearly like to be able to make my Pine work with a localy running   
copy of Cnews. Does anybody know how to set this up? I currently use nn and 
tin - they both suck. Only pine will do!

I also have a not entirely related to pine problem: Whenever I post some
news, this happens:

--Posting article...relaynews: set[ug]id failed (Bad file number)

I suspect this may be something to do with permissions or something dull
like that. According to some dox somebody gave me I have to set file
permissions thus:

FILE(S) OR DIRECTORY(IES)                OWNER   GROUP   OTHER REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------                -----   -----   ------------------
/var/lib/news/setnewsids                 root    (any)   setuid
/usr/lib/newsbin/relay/relaynews         news    news    setuid + setgid
/usr/lib/newsbin/input/newsspool         news    news    setuid + setgid

Can somebody explain to me what setuid and setgid actualy mean and the
syntax of the command used to change them?

Please reply to me via mail rather than in this newsgroup. Apologies for the
partial off-topicness of this message.

titl: Pine 3.91 FreePort Security Patch
rev:  25.08.95
auth: John Wells <wells@capaccess.org>, CapAccess Freenet Staff
abs:  This will patch the original Pine 3.91 mailer to allow greater 
	security.  

Some Features
-------------
  * Restricted directory access above the user's home directory
  * Disallowed 'read file' option from inside Pico
  * Restricted feature list using the included 'pine-fp.conf[.fixed]' 
	file(s)

License
-------
This patch is distributed under the GNU Public License.  If the file 
COPYING was not included with the patch, it can be obtained by ftp at 
prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/COPYING

Installation
------------
1. Make/rename a directory 'clnpine' for the original Pine sources and a 
directory 'pine' for the "dirty" Pine sources.  Follow the same procedure 
for Pico: e.g. 'clnpico' and 'pico'.

2. If you don't use os_unix.c as your osdep.c file in the Pico directory, 
make sure you copy os_unix.c to osdep.c before you use the patch.

3. The vital FreePort information (location of the pine-fp.conf[.fixed] 
file(s), exempt group, etc.) are located in pico.h and pine.h 
respectively.  Change those to suit your needs

4. Use 'patch < pine.diff' from your Pine source directory.  

5. Recompile.

Notes
-----
I compiled this under a SunOS 4.1.2 machine using the Sun 'cc'.  Things 
should work under any Unix machine, but if they don't, mail me. :)

This patch archive is available by anonymous ftp at 
ftp.capaccess.org:/pub/freeport/pine/3.91/pine3.91-fp.tar.gz.

Please direct all questions/comments/suggestions (I know there'll be 
suggestions :) to <wells@capaccess.org>.

I've looked through some of the FAQ's and the technical specifications
document on the pine web server (http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine) and I
would like to know if someone here can verify an observation of mine.  If
I understand correctly, Pine uses the ~/.mailcap file (or $MAILCAP or
/etc/mailcap) file for decoding a mime-encoded message, but it does not
use any configuration file (such as a ~/.mime.types) to determine
content-type when encoding a message.  Instead it does some kludgy
internal file-type identification scheme to set the content-type. 

Is this correct? Is there anyway around this?  Might something like a
.mime.types file be used in version 3.92 or later?

have never before tried to run the Winsock Pine, so could have problems

The vacation program can be tricky since there are another 2 files (I 
believe) on which it relies.  O'Reilly's THE WHOLE INTERNET gives an 
excellent description on how to set up this program.

Listserver programmes on virtual machines distribute mail to lists of
subscribers who discuss specific subjects or topics of interest to the
group. There are several brands of listservers: majordomo, listserv,
listproc, and listmanager are known to me. Each is similar, with a variety
of range and possibility of commands. 

Listserv is the oldest, has the widest use and can be asked to look for 
lists which are of interest to you through keyword search. Although I think 
majordomo is fast behind listserv in popularity, there is a reluctance of 
its creators to develop the advanced search techniques of "Listserv."

Commands contained in email messages may be sent to known sites which
maintain lists and each site will respond with the names of various lists
which they maintain and distribute. BUT you must know the kind of
listserver which is used in each case. 

Each variety of listserv generally responds to the command HELP which you
insert in an email message to the machine which maintains the lists. So, if
you know a particular site you wish to search for a list which interests
you, you may send, for example, the command HELP in an email to
majordomo@site_name. This variety of listserv will send back a short
synopsis of commands and information. 

Listserv programme - which is the original listserver - has a more
complete system of interaction, and for that reason is a little
complicated. But once you have studied its commands, it will provide you
more information about the kinds of lists using the programme throughout
the entire internet and you can more easily identify the discussion groups
in which you wish to participate. This is accomplished through keyword
search. 

As a trial you might send commands to one of the main distribution 
machines for Listserv at the following address:

listserv@cunyvm.cuny.edu

Try these commands:

get refcard
help

You can actually stack these commands within a single email.

AND, if you already have an idea of a topical list to which you would like
to subscribe, you may want to try the following command: 

Lists Global /xyz

WHERE xyz is a keyword, e.g. music, disability, math, ESL etc.

It is a very literal search of all listserv sites known to the cunyvm
machine, so you may have to refine the word you use. For example DISAB
will pick up disability and disabled. But you may want to try the word
handicap (even though this word is often misused). NB! If you fail to use
the slash switch / with the qualifier "Global", the server will return a
HUGE file with hundreds and hundreds of lists from sites all over the
world. (This file is REALLY big.) Using the word "Lists" by itself <no
quotes> will return a list of only the lists provided by the cunyvm
machine itself. 

Finally, the help files will tell you the explicit way in which 
you may join a list discussion group. The keyword list from listserv will 
also tell you how to join the specific lists for which you have searched.

I hope this information will help you in your search.

Bill McQueen in Toronto

Anyone,

I recently started receiving messages from someone (on another list) that 
contained MS-TNEF attachements.  Pine says it cannot view it and tells me 
to save the file.  I did that, but cannot view the file with Pico or vi, 
etc.  

What is the file type, and how do I view it?

TIA,

Assuming you are using 3.91, you can do this with the Aggregate commands.
First permit the use of the aggregate commands (go to setup, switch on
enable-aggregate-command-set).
Then use ; to mark the message you want to include
Then use
A F  (All Forward) to include the messages in forward format

or

A R (All Reply) to include the messages in reply format (with > before the
     text).

Then cut out the lines you dont want.

OK?

There is an option in the configuration settings to set "sort by date" 
which may be more to your taste.

I have the same problem with the <SPACE> acting as <RETURN>,
in the Subject-field and in the mail text.
If you use <CTRL>D to erase a character, then the problem is solved??!!

I've a rather unique situation I guess.  I am using pine to read news on 
another machine and I am NOT using pine to read mail on my machine... at 
least, I don't want to.  I have my own mail reader which I keep going 
while using pine (3.91) but this causes PINE to be confused somehow, as I 
keep getting a message:

[MAIL FOLDER "INBOX" CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR]

namely, my other mail reader stole the mail away from pine.

So how do I use pine just for news and not for mail, or, how can I just 
workaround this problem?

Thanks

Timothy,

I think you can get around if you change the path to your INBOX (must be in the 
Config-Screen) to some other existing mailfolder (or create an empty one).

Ciao,

I'm running PC-Pine for Windows 3.91 (winsock version). Whenever I 
terminate the application, the program manager is restored. Since I 
prefer to run with the PM minimized, does anyone know how to have it stay 
minimized? Is this a PC Pine for Windows problem or a Windows problem?

Any ideas appreciated .... I despise Windows but *have* to use it :(

I'm fairly sure there aren't.  Check out ftp.celestial.com or 
odi.cwc.whecn.edu instead.  I know for a fact there are Pine binaries for 
SCO there.  They were built on 3.2.4.2, and often work just fine on other 
versions of SCO.

I have following problem. I use pc-pine in pc which have several users. When some user sends
mail with pc-pine it is copied in folder SENTMAIL.MTX and if one saves read messages 
(which are in INBOX folder) these messages are copied in folder SAVEMAIL.MTX. 
The problem is that these two .MTX files are on pc's hard disk and every user can read these 
two folders. Can one define 'private folders' in pc-pine or is it possible to use 
unix folders saved-messages and sent-mail (which one can't access unless knowing my login 
and password to unix system) instead of these two .MTX files.

Hello all!

I'm looking for a way to force Pine to set Content-Transfer-Encoding
to 8bit instead of Quoted-Printable. Is it possible at all? The only
answer I've though out is to put line

"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" to my .pinerc in customized-hdrs.
Now, is this "the right thing" to do? (Pine is 3.91 on SunOS 4.1.3)

Thanks,
	Jari

I left out a crucial word in the suggested commands. I should have 
suggested the command

get listserv refcard

or

info refcard


I am sorry for any confusion I may have caused.

I just upgraded my PINE version to 3.91.  I ftped all of the binaries 
from uwash and included was some imapd binary.  Can someone help me 
determine what that binary is for?  I do not have a version of 
it currently on my Linux system.  If I do, I was unable to locate it.

Thanks,
Mike

Create a shellscript that is run by cron every minute or hour or whatever 
that copies a random file (.signature.x) to .signature where x is a 
ramdom number from 0 to 9. You can use the $RANDOM shell variable to get 
a pseudo-random number.  Just use the last digit of this variable to 
select you file.  I don't have an example handy but I once did this with 
.gif files to get a random backdrop.

Is there a way to forward one of my Pine distribution lists from my

the distribution list himself?  I am running Pine 3.91 in a Unix

Thanks in advance.

yes through a utility in unix, which filters mail. In solaris 2.3, it is 
called procmail.
to activate it, you need to create 2 files.
.forward (dot forward) and
.procmailrc 
in dot forward you type
"|IFS=' ' && exec /util/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 # username", where 
username is your username. You use the quotes.
In the dot procmailrc, you create folders that store the various mail.
For example if you want all the emails that come to you from 
pine-info@cac.washington.edu, to be stored in a different mail folder 
within pine, called for example 'Pine', and not 'INBOX', you may create 
the following in your dot procmailrc
MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/log
MY_NAME="Jaz"
MY_ADDR=""
:0:
* ^From .*PINE
PINE


If you dont want "Junk" mail, I suggest you creat a Junk folder, within 
pine if u like, then all those mail will be placed in junk, which u can 
delete 'en-block', or read a few.

     :0
     * ^Subject:.*dumbass
     /dev/null
 
where dumbass is the mail u keep getting. It is automatically put in the 
bin, and is deleted

 If you dont want "Junk" mail, I suggest you creat a 
Junk folder, within
 pine if u like, then all those mail will be placed in junk, which u can
 delete 'en-block', or read a few.

If you run imapd on a server, it enables fx. pine to retrieve your
mail on that server, from another machine, using the imap-protocol.

We run such a server and the people here can read their mailbox,
regardless of what machine they are working on, just for the moment
(we have suns, rs'es, vax'es, and you reach the same mailbox from
them all).

Try this:  At the Unix prompt, simply type the word vacation and enter. 
If your Unix supports that program, it will walk you through it, asking 
if you want to view the message, edit it, or enable it.

You can set the .vacation feature if you're running on Unix.  I often do 
this when I'm facing a deadline and not tending to my e-mail for a day or so.

Try using the aggregate commands ... That's what I do when I subscribe to 
a new Usenet group.  When you are in the group, enter ';a' (wihtout the 
quotes of course).  That will choose all the messages.  Then enter 'ad' 
to delete them all.  The next time you come to the newsgroup, those 
messages won't show up for you.

If you have problems with the aggregate command, check your set-up to 
make you that aggregate commands are enabled.  

If this doesn't work, drop me a note ...

geez, yeah that wasn't too obvious.... I think I've been sitting in front

I'd like to know if Pine can be used to read Usenet newsgroups and if so, 
how do I configure it?
 
Also, I am a blind user, using a text-to-speech conversion package.  Pine 
seems to haul the system cursor around the screen after each Pine 
command.  This causes my screen access software to read the screen to me 
over and over.  Is there a way to configure Pine so that it is more 
interactive with the system cursor as it really exists?  For instance, if 
I am in the index feature, and I D msg 4, I will hear that I have deleted 
msg 4 before I her that I am on msg 5.  If I am quoting a msg in a reply, 
I will hear, as I type my new reply, the quoted parts over and over.  If 
I cursor down through the screen to edit, I will have to hit my next line 
<cursor down> then my key whhich reads my current line because the Pine 
cursor and the system cursor seem to meld at this point and my speech 
*thinks* we are on the previous line.  It has been explained to me by my 
sys op that Pine grabs the keyboard and treats the machine of the user 
like a dumb terminal.  My terminal has to stay smart@!! <g> got any ideas?
 
 Thanks!!

However, every time I try to mail my 'last' mailing to tell

get this error and how to eliminate it??

It sounds very likely that your problem lies not with Pine, but with an 
old version of the system "sendmail" program (Pine composes the message 
then hands it to sendmail for transmission/delivery).

The problem came about when a security hole was discovered in sendmail; 
there have been a number of them over the years.  A new version of 
sendmail (8.6.11) was released which fixed the security hole, and most 
sites put this up (after all, a security hole is a security hole!).

However there was a but in this new version of sendmail that caused it to 
crash and core dump when sending a message to more than a small (I think 
about 20) number of recipients.

This was fixed in another new version (8.6.12) and works OK.  
Unfortunately quite a number of sites don't seem to have heard about this 
version, or at least they haven't bothered to put it up (after all 
security isn't an issue ;-).

So the solution is to ask your System Manager to check which version of 
sendmail is installed on your machines and upgrade (if this is indeed the 
problem) to 8.6.12.

As a footnote... we had some problems here persuading Silicon Graphics 
that 8.6.12 was needed.  They claimed the problem lay in Pine!  Anyway, 
after flooding them with copies of messages about the matter received 
from the Net we convinced them, and they duly made 8.6.12 available for IRIX.

First some terminology so we're talking the same language :-)

I tend to refer to the file new mail get delivered into as the "delivery 
file"; this typically is called something like /var/mail/username.  Also 
the directory in which this file lives (/var/mail in the above example) 
as the "delivery area".  For most people's setups Pine presents the 
contents of the delivery file as the INBOX folder.  However in some 
special cases (if you are using the mbox or Tenex drivers within Pine to 
keep the INBOX in a file called "mbox" or "mail.txt" respectively in the 
user's home directory) messages are moved out of the delivery file into 
the mbox (mail.txt) file, and this is then presented as the INBOX folder.

OK, having now no doubt got you confused.... :-}

If you are accessing the delivery file over NFS then "authentication" 
doesn't enter the situation at all.  At least, not beyond that you have 
already done by logging in to UNIX.  In this setup it is UNIX's file 
access mechanisms that determine whether or not you can read/write the 
delivery file.

So if you are using NFS for delivery file access then don't worry about 
authentication within Pine: you don't need it.  Instead just make sure 
that Pine was compiled properly so that it knows where your delivery area 
is.  It will append the username to create the delivery file name and 
access it directly.

Unfortunately accessing the delivery file over NFS has assorted problems 
and is not recommended.  These difficulties lie in limitations in the 
file locking mechanism as implemented over NFS.  Specifically some 
systems do not implement it at all, whilst others attempt to but can fail 
to work properly when subject to high locking activity.

The recommended route is to use an IMAP server....

The source code for an IMAP server is included within the Pine 
distribution.  Ths server is run on the same machine that physically 
hosts the mailstore disk, and mail reading clients then link to the IMAP 
server and request it to return or manipulate messages.

This has the advantage that the IMAP server can use file locking 
successfully (as the disk is local to the machine).  It also means that 
mail clients for micros (eg, ECSmail/Simeon for PCs, Mailstrom or 
Mulberry for Macs) can access the same mailstore.

Unlike the vaguely similar POP protocol IMAP manipulates the messages in 
place on the server computer; POP downloads the messages to the micro's 
hard disk.  This means that IMAP is much better in distributed 
environments, where mail may be read from many different computers 
including classroom machines.

To tell Pine to use IMAP to access the INBOX folder you must set the 
"inbox-path" configuration variable (typically in the system wide Pine 
configuration file) to something like this: '{imap.host.domain}inbox'

Doing this tells Pine not to use read/write calls to access the file 
directly over NFS, but to open a connection to the IMAP server computer 
("imap.host.domain") and obtain the INBOX folder.

Obviously the IMAP server needs ot be sure that the person connecting is 
allowed to see the mail stored in a particular folder, and so needs some 
form of authentication whereby it can be sure of the username told it.

One way is, naturally, to ask the user of the mail reader to enter their 
username and password for the IMAP server computer.  If the IMAP server 
validates these it then allows access.

However this makes mail reading a bit of a pain as the username and 
password have to be entered every time the mail reader (Pine) is started up.

So a short-cut mechanism can be set up...

On the IMAP server computer a symbolic link should be made from 
"/etc/rimapd" to point to the real IMAP server software (typically 
somewhere like "/usr/local/lib/imapd").

When Pine starts up it first tries to issue an "rsh imap.host.domain 
/etc/rimapd" command to open the connection to the IMAP server.  This 
uses the UNIX "rsh" mechanism to link to the server machine and tries to 
run the "/etc/rimapd" program.  If all is well the software (IMAP server) 
runs and, because it was invoked through the rsh mechanism, can determine 
and trust the username of the person at the far end.  The IMAP session 
springs into life without any need for the user to type in a username and 
password as Pine starts up.

If the rsh command fails Pine fails back to prompting the user to enter 
their username and password in order to start the session.

If you use the (recommended) IMAP access method for reaching your mail 
folders then it is definitely worth looking at setting up the rsh 
mechanism.  To do this you will need to set up the symbolic link 
mentioned above AND ALSO allow your users to rsh to the IMAP server 
computer without having to quote a password.  This typically involves 
setting up either a "hosts.equiv" file on the IMAP server computer, or a 
".rhosts" file in the home directory of each and every user (we went for 
the former approach).  Check the manual pages about "rsh" and "rshd" for 
information about this.

If you decide not to use the rsh mechanism but still want to use IMAP for 
mail access (thereby forcing your users to enter their username and 
password every time they start Pine) you should bypass the rsh attempt so 
that they don't get delayed for long periods whilst the attempt is made 
and fails.  You can do this by adding the particulat port your IMAP 
server runs on (usually 143) to the IMAP path specification for the 
inbox-path.  Thus "{imap.host.domain}inbox" would instead be set as 
"{imap.host.domain:143}inbox".

I hope all this helps.  (I don't *think* I've got it all right!)

Yes, there is! Once you're in the right folder, hit ; (select) then A (all) 
then A (apply) then D (delete). This will mark all the messages in that 
folder for deletion. Alternatively if you want to select a range, e.g. 
1-500, type in 1-500 after you've hit ;. Whether you can use the above 
commands is determined by the "feature-list" options in your Pine configuration.

Best wishes,
Mickey.

Assuming you're using Pine 3.91...

Go into the Setup Configuration screen (S then C from the Main Menu) and 
make sure that "enable-aggregate-cmd-set" is turned on.

Now go to the index and give the Select command by typing ";"

This allows you to select messages using a variety of criteria.  
(Additional Select commands can Broaden (or) or Narrow (and) criteria.)

Now Apply a command by typing "A", followed by the command you want to 
apply (in this case "D" for delete).

This is probably something for the developers.=20

I would like to have the possibility to re-define the key assignments in
pico, so that I could use ^y to delete lines instead of ^k. So far, I tend
to use the alternate editor (joe) for longer texts, because pico just
drives me crazy whenever I try to delete a line.=20

I typically move around from a lab to my office and use pine in both places
to access my mail.  I start pine in the lab, go to my office during lunch,
and start pine there. When I access INBOX from the office pine session, the 
lab pine session gets its INBOX set to readonly.  Fine.  Now, I go back to the
lab and want this pine session to take control but it's INBOX is set to
readonly.  The only way I've found around it, is to quit and restart pine.

Is there a way within the current session to take control of the INBOX, i.e.,
set the other pine session to readonly?

     Type the range of messages e.g. 1-345 (Pressing "?" gives more details)
   
This will mark all messages you want to delete. There will either be an 
"X" beside each selected message, or it will be in bold type, depending 
on your config options.

Next, type "A" for Apply
      type "d" to delete

This will mark the selected range as deleted. You can then expunge them, 
or do with them what you wish.

This is a REALLY nice feature of 3.91

Also does anyone know how to append the pine 'distribution list' in

"attached-to-ansi" means that a user who is logged on to a UNIX
workstation from a PC or MAC with an printer directly attached to the PC
or MAC (or a UNIX workstation) can hit prYnt and the output will go to the
attached printer.  In some communication packages, the ^S/^Q have to be
temporarily disabled for this to work.  Our users have found this very
convenient since we have a central Electronic Post Office where users can
read their mail with PINE, but printers are not directly available to the
users at this time.

Summary:

A problem with user.lock files remaining when users disconnect a terminal
session on a Solaris 2.4 compuer without closing PINE 3.91 was solved by
adding mailbox cleanup code to the signal handling routines.

I recently built PINE 3.91 on a SUNOS 5.X (Solaris) system using the
"build sol" option in the configuration.  We began having problems with
instances of /var/mail/user.lock files being left around.  The problem can
be reproduced by closing an Xwindow session or quitting a telnet session
with a Ctrl-] without previously closing the running PINE session.  The
problem does not occur under SUNOS 4.X.  The problem occurs only when the
session is interrupted with a mailbox which contains mail is open.

Building PINE with DEBUG turned on and using the d 9 option on the command
line showed that PINE was ending by two different paths:  one which passed
through the signal handler for SIGHUP, hup_signal() which calls a routine
fast_clean_up() to close open mailbox streams and remove the user.lock
file, and another which was finally tracked to a call to "read" in the function
read_with_timeout() in ttyin.c (line 381) where the debug message "** Error reading
from tty :  No such file or directory" was returned.

The system utility "truss" under Solaris 2.4 was used to trace the system
calls PINE performed, the signals it received, and the machine faults it
incurred.  (Paraphrasing from the man page).  This showed that two
signals, SIGHUP and SIGTSTP were produced when the terminal session was
interrupted.  In addition, it showed that the read in ttyin.c which
failed returned 0. The man page for termio under Solaris 2.4 states that these
two signals are produced when a modem disconnect is detected.  The man
page for termio on a SUNOS 4.X system states that only a SIGHUP is
produced in the same circumstances.

The signal handling code for PINE is contained in signals.c.  The only
call to the routine fast_clean_up() which removes the user.lock file
occurs in the signal handlers hup_signal() and term_signal().  The 
SIGTSTP is ignored.  

Adding a call to fast_clean_up() to the routine auger_in_signal() causes
it to also check for open mailboxes and their associated user.lock files
and remove them if present.  The signal call to handle SIGTSTP was changed to

	signal (SIGSTSP, auger_in_signal)

Adding this mailbox check has resulted in no locks being left around.

The code which appears to clean up the mailbox in the function read_with_timeout()
in ttyin.c after the read fails is probably never executed when terminal
disconnects occur .  Dprint statements there were never executed.

I just got stuck in my mail program (Pine), and since nothing else would

unread. Is there any way to retrieve them? Should I contact my server?

Well I tried this, but I kept getting error messages about files missing 
in c-client. I didn't want to run in c-client, so now I'm just looking 
around to see if there isn't another way on installing it. (I say looking

Subject: PC-Pine using Unix ~/.addressbook?
Date: 7 Sep 1995 19:28:09 -0400

Quick question:

We are using a PC-Pine setup over a TIA link, for the students at my
school, and I am trying to find a way to get the PC-Pine to look at
the Unix Host that it is connected to, for the addressbook.  Can this
be done?

I have tried putting in the pinerc, the following, at the proper
place:

1)  ~/.addressbook
2)  .addressbook
3)  {host.domain.edu}.addressbook


And none of the above works.  Am I trying to do something impossible?

Thanks!

Jason

I am new to computers and I just started using pine. I heard about 
newsgroups and was wondering if anyone could give me addresses to 
interesting newsgroups.  I am interested in all kinds of things like 
sports, computers, animals, RC car racing, and computer and video games 
to name a few.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

It would be nice if you could give the subject of the newsgroup with the 
address.

No.  It's more than just "taking control".  It's knowing what is in the
folder.  "Readonly" means that the in-memory snapshot no longer
corresponds to what is on the disk.  The only way to restore that
correspondence is to toss out the snapshot and start over, and the easiest
way to do that is to quit and restart Pine.

I'm in dire need of a good editor at my new job and I

I'd appreciate any information on obtaining PICO for

Giuseppe,
Remote access to address books is a planned enhancement, but not yet
available.  (In the upcoming 3.92 version, it will be possible to share
addressbooks between Unix Pine and PC-Pine if you have a shared
filesystem, e.g. NFS or SMB, but true remote access without relying on a
file system protocol is not done yet, and won't make it into 3.92.)

Hello people,

I want to use pgpsendmail instead of the standard sendmail but I'm just a mere
mortal on the machines I'm using (ie I'm not root) and I don't want to
recompile pine from scratch because it would take up too much space in my
account... so what i need is an option to send outgoing mail to a local
program, but this program is NOT sendmail.  I think that the SMTP-server line
in .pinerc is not usable in this case since it is a program i want to specify
and not a host.

Has anyone had experience with this?  Please reply via email, I'll summarize.

Thanks in advance !

Try Lynx, ... make a file named MENU (or something like that) in html,
then make PINE, FTP, TELNET, Helps, UseNets, whatever, start (link) from
that lynx menu.  It's not as good as a Dosshell for example, but it's easy
for novices, and they don't have to remember the unix commands.  I'm not
sure this answers your question, but hope it helps.  G'Day.

Add the value:
	
	Return-Receipt-To:

to the customized-hdrs field in Setup -> Config.

When you compose a message, you can enable Rich Headers to let
you add your e-mail address (complete address).

You *could* add:

	Return-Receipt-To: <your e-mail address>

but you'd be setting return receipting as the default action.  
I don't use it unless it's an important message.....

We just upgraded to 3.91 and a few users are seeing a subtle display 
problem:   When exiting Pine, the prompt line, such as "save read-mail 
to..." is overwritten by the next line, and vanishes before the user sees 
it.  This problem has not been reported at any other screen.  So far, I 
have not seen enough instances of this to determine a pattern based on 
either machine type or software (all machines are using some version of 
telnet to connect; this is not happening on serial lines).

Anyone see anything like this?  Any clues as to what to look for? I 
suspect some kind of video display glitch - every Gateway 486 or pentium 
running the WFW 32-bit TCP stack has the problem, plus one Mac (the only 
one of that model on campus).

hello tran,
thanks for the info. Your renaming of INBOX, seems cryptic to me,
so can one change its name, by chaning the setting, for example
incoming mail path (for INBOX) set to say $Home/Mail/'new_inbox_name, 
instead of /bin/mail/userid??

 oh thanks, i knew that one, i believe u have to set up for Config sys in 
pine, to have that ability .

Last Tran, do u know HOW to set up procmail, such that a new log file is 
created every day, and the old is deleted, do u set up %d,-f, option or 
something.
thanks in advance

A while ago, I posted an article asking how to auto-move read messages.
Well, I got many wonderful replies (thanks) and it works great,
but what do you do when you read a message but don't have time to reply to it.
You could save it to read-messages and come back to it of course, but I 
am letting important email slip by me that way.
Is there a way to mark some messages to keep so that it wont move them
to read-messages?

Is there such a program that can connect to my IMAP server at port 143,

and 0 if I don't?  For example, at my unix ksh prompt:

	(host:jviolett) $ cmail {hostname:143}/var/mail/username
	(host:jviolett) $ echo $?
	(host:jviolett) $ 3

which would indicate the number of new messages.

We don't use rsh for security reasons.  Can this be done without me 
actually having to type my username and password to access the mail box 
as is the case when I first connect with Pine?

Thanks for any help.

I have a couple of questions regarding imap and Pine.

I am running BSDI v2.0 on several machines.  One machine is the mail server.  
Users cannot access this machine except in Pine (or other imap client).

When attaching a file from a machine (other than the mail server) we get the 
message:
		error in postioning attachment.

The file does attach and is sent.  However users are upset with the message.  
What is causing the message?

We have recently installed a news server and have initially set up pine 
3.91 on a test basis.

I noticed in the manifest that there was no default "pine.conf" file.

We would like to set it so the first time a user uses pine3.91, he or 
she will not have to do set up and configuration on their own.

We'd like to have so immediately, the user will read his or her 
newsgroups as folders and they will have an expanded view of their 
folders with newsgroups.

Also the news server will be defaulted to our news server.

Any help in this regards would be greatly appreciated.

Pine doesn't invoke metamail directly.  Is it possible that you have a
.mailcap file that calls metamail?

Hello All --

I posted this message a couple of weeks ago with NO responses...here goes 
again:

Is there a way to prevent users from printing the "help file" from within 
pine?

Also, is there a way to prevent users from prining the "public" address book?

Thanks,

Mary Aplin

I will be happy (if somewhat embarrassed) to hear how easy it is to 
simply print out the Index to a given newsgroup when using Pine to view 
newsgroups.  (Other than by doing successive screen prints, of course.)

Go to "list folders", select another folder, and then select the
INBOX-folder again. Then you shall get it read-write.

Dear Pine users,
   I need to make the subject conversion and haven't succeeded yet

  I am converting from DOS using FTP Software's PCTCP mail functions. It 
uses a simple mail.rc file with "aliases". I have ASCII edited the file 
to have space delimited fields like the PINE .addressbook. But PINE fails 
to understand it. 

  Can someone advise me if and how to do such a conversion?

Please reply to my signature e-mail address.
Thanks, Allen

actually, that address is NOT the Pine Development Team.  it's an

Make a plan with any text editor (if you're familiar with pine, then pico
is probably yer best bet), then save it your home directory as filename
.plan (notice it's '.plan', not 'plan').  Hope this helps... G'Day.

How do I shut off the beeping in pine? I don't want a beel to sound every
time I press an incorrect command. 

Thx,

Anyone know how to spell-check pine with ispell?  Is there an alternative
program (publicly accessible) that will do what Unix spell does, i.e. emit
the errors only (rather than the corrected text as ispell does).  I guess
it would not be a vast project to roll your own Unix spell, but I can't get
perl5 to work with gdbm (seems the natural way). So would like a readymade'un.

I have this message in my Pine:

> From: PMDF IMAP server <nobody@nowhere>
> Subject: <Placeholder file>

1. What can I do with this? This kind of placeholders are borne by 
themselves? My folder is empty - but this message and folder stays...

I can't get rid of it! Always a message about "this command doesn't 
work" just here and so on... D doesn't delete... Just this message in a 
folder of it's one...

2. What shall I do to get the Prynt to print somewhere where I can find the 
text? It doesn't come to the attached printer in my room, not to the one 
in our net here in Savonlinna, so I suppose it goes to a "main 
university printer" in Joensuu, some 150 km from here... But when I use 
Internet I can choose if I want to get my text in my room or in our net 
room... - How can I chose the printer in Savonlinna for Pine? I tried the 
three suggested methods - none worked!

3. When or where can I get the Faq?

4. Where can I find something on the editor or spelling control program 
for Pine, if you have one?

TIA  Kristina

First some terminology:

"pine.conf" is the name of the systemwide configuration file that the 
System Manager sets up.  The usual location for this file is 
"/usr/local/lib/pine.conf".  The settings in this file act as defaults 
for every user, but can be overridden by users setting up their own 
preferences.

"pine.conf.fixed" is the name of the systemwise configuration file also 
set up by the System Manager.  It too lives in the "/usr/local/lib" 
directory.  The settings in this file act as enforced settings for every 
user: they cannot be overrideen by users' own preferences.  (If someone 
tries they are given a warning as Pine starts and their value is ignored.)

".pinerc" is the name in a user's home directory of the file which stores 
their own preferences.  Whilst it is possible to edit this file directly 
with your favourite text editor Pine 3.91 has a very good Setup 
Configuration screen that allows all the options to be set up and 
includes excellent context sensitive help.  This screen is reached with 
"S" then "C" from Pine's Main Menu.

> We would like to set it so the first time a user uses pine3.91, he or 
> she will not have to do set up and configuration on their own.

Whenever a new user uses Pine they will have a personal ".pinerc" file 
set up in their home directory.  However most of the variables in it have 
no values assigned to them, meaning that whatever systemwide defaults 
have been set up in the "pine.conf" file are used instead.

So what you need to do is:

1.  Set up the systemwide pine.conf file with appropriate defaults.

2.  Decide if you want to enforce any settings by also including them in 
    the systemwide pine.conf.fixed file

As you say, no "pine.conf" file is included in the Pine distribution.  
This is because it is generated from Pine itself.  Simply give this command:

	pine -conf >pine.conf

And you will have a systemwide configuration file template that you can 
edit and move into position.  Remember to give everyone "read" access to it!

Any settings you want to enforce can be copied into a file called 
pine.conf.fixed file (I usually copy the comments across too).  Note that 
things like the "feature-list" variable work as you would hope, not as 
you might expect.  That is, those values assigned to "feature list" in 
the pine.conf.fixed file are "fixed", and the others are over-ridable by 
the users (when I at first tried this I wondered if every possible value 
of "feature-list" would be fixed as a result).

> We'd like to have so immediately, the user will read his or her 
> newsgroups as folders and they will have an expanded view of their

To do this, set the following up in your systemwide pine.conf file:

	nntp-server	... the IP address of your News server.
	feature-list
		expanded-view-of-folders
			... expand all folders.
		news-approximates-new-status
			... this can be useful too: it tries to guess which
			    articles are new News, and which you read but did
			    not delete last time you read the News.

Note that we have found it better *not* to expand the folders.  The 
reason is that *all* folders get expanded whenever the "L" command is 
used, which can slow things down.  Our users seem capable of hitting the 
Down Arrow key (to move to the "News Collections" field) and then 
pressing Return (to expand the list).

> Also the news server will be defaulted to our news server.

See above about setting the "nntp-server" variable.

> Any help in this regards would be greatly appreciated.

We have written a little "Quick Reference Guide" for using Pine to access 
Usenet News.  We print it double sided on one sheet of A4 card, which is 
then folded to make a mni-pamphlet.

You can see the text of this on our Web server at:
http://www.york.ac.uk/services/cserv/documentation/guides/comms/usenetqr.html

Please make allowances for the fact it is a semi-converted dump of a 
PageMaker document, so the font used to show keystrokes comes up as funny 
characters over the Web (I must get round to fixing the HTML version up!).

The one snippet of information I didn't know at the time I wrote the 
guide was the usefulness of the "Tab" key.  This steps on to the next New 
article in the current newsgroup.  If none are left it offers to check 
following newsgroups for New articles, before eventually offering to 
return you to the INBOX folder.  (I'll be putting this in the next 
release of the Guide when we reprint.)

If you wish to use our Quick Reference Guide as a basis for something of 
your own you are welcome, but please contact our Information Desk 
(infodesk@york.ac.uk) to check about acknowledgements first of all.  Thanks!

ASSUMING that the terminal emulation software you are using understands 
the ANSI control sequences to start and stop redirecting arriving 
information to the attached printer THEN you could try using the 
"attached-to-ansi" printer setting.

You do this by selecting Setup Printer ("S" then "P" from Pine's Main 
Menu) and then picking item number 1.

If your terminal emulator accepts the control code sequences needed to 
work you should be able to print a message simply by using Pine's "Y" 
command.  (If it doesn't work the message text will probably just appear 
on the screen instead.)

(Note that you may need to fiddle with your micro's printer setup options 
to make sure it goes to the right output port, etc.)

If you find that it sort of works, but is getting corrupted at points you 
may need to turn on the "preserve-start-stop-characters" feature in the 
Setup Configuration screen ("S" then "C" from the Main Menu).

I am using Pine 3.91 (with IMAPD toolkit 3.6) and Winsock ver PC Pine

This happen as well, when I tested Eudora using ipop3d (which comes 
together with IMAPD toolkit 3.6).

Anybody has any idea ?

Hi,

I have Pine 3.91 on a Sparc10 (SunOS 4.1.3), with a global-address-book (GAB)
of about 1 MEG.  Normally it would take ~10 seconds for pine to create a
/usr/tmp/a30????? file from the GAB when in Compose window.  But since last
Friday 9/8, it is taking ~5 minutes to create that file for each user.

This is what happens exactly:

1.  Go into pine.
2.  C  for compose message
3.  Put in the destination name:
    To: scmahmoo
4.  Get a message: Lookup file /usr/tmp/a3003263 doesn't exist, creating
5.  ls -l a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff      34104 Sep 11 10:37 a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff     104462 Sep 11 10:37 a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff     219121 Sep 11 10:39 a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff     322186 Sep 11 10:39 a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff     434176 Sep 11 10:40 a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff     507904 Sep 11 10:40 a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff     606208 Sep 11 10:41 a4003263
    -rw-r--r--   1 scmahmoo staff     663552 Sep 11 10:41 a4003263
6.  Message clears, and user can resume with the message. Took about
    5 minutes.



Very annoying for the user.

Load Average on system: 4.24
       Number of users: 81   (Not all are using Pine)
            Pine Users: 20




Any insight into this matter will be appreciated.
Thanks

I've noticed that PC Pine is very slow (on the order of minutes) when
exiting when you delete, say 100+ messages.  Any way of speeding this up
or is this just the way it is.  The Unix version doesn't seem to have this
problem and from what I can tell the server isn't the problem (according
to top).

Ummmm, I'm assuming that you clipped the wrong line from the FAQ.  The one
you quoted above makes no claims about being an e-mail address. 
"Archive-name" is "always" the first non-header line in any FAQ that is
archived at MIT.  Surely you have seen at least one other FAQ and noticed
this.  The archive name is a standardized form which can be used to
retrieve any FAQ from the rtfm.mit.edu mail server without knowing the
full path to the file.  In this case, pine-faq is in the comp.mail
hierarchy, so its name starts with "mail/".  It is *not* a "mailto" URL
and should not be construed as one.



Here is what how the Pine FAQ starts:

========= Begin Quote
Archive-name: mail/pine-faq

------------------------------
Date: Tue, 10 Feb 95 15:40:48 -0800
From: The Pine Development Team <pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu>
Content-Description: Where is the latest FAQ?


The most up-to-date version of this FAQ can be found at any of these places: 

   http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/faq/
   ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/faq
   mailto:pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu
========= End Quote


The "mailto" URL is clearly indicated as a method for retrieving the FAQ. 
The address given is the same as the FAQ originator, 8 lines above.  If
you aren't paying attention and simply Reply-To the FAQ, you will
obviously not receive your expected response.

We echo your concern.  Although connected continually, our provider's 
NNTP server is often dead or down for whatever reason.  Sometimes it will 
accept a connection, but never respond beyond that.  When this happens, 
pine just freezes solid, requiring the session to be disconnected.  

I suspect this is also related to 'runaway' pine processes which sometimes
take all the cpu time, even though the user who started the program is not
logged in. 

I'd definately like to hear any solutions.

Glad you asked that question.  I have an email notification program
for Windows, WinBiff, to which I've just added IMAP support.
It's still in beta, should be released by mid-October.  
If your users have Windows boxes with WinSock, this should do the
trick.

Mail me at winbiff@blimpy.demon.co.uk if you need more information.

Message-Id: <mreiserDF60po.4yz@netcom.com>
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 18:29:46 GMT
Status: O
X-Status: 


Summary:
  Anyone else experienced any flakiness in pine's printing?

Background: 
  Connecting, via telnet, to SunOS 4.1.x box running pine 3.91.
  Telnet is via WTNVT from FTP Software's OnNet 1.2.
  Using "attached-ansi" as the print option in pine.

Symptom:
  Print jobs are sometimes held up until the terminal emulation window 
  is closed, at which time, the print job is sent ok. 

Questions: 
  1. How can I configure WTNVT and/or pine to send the print jobs upon
  request (instead of having to close the emulation window)?

  2. Is this an emulation problem or a pine flakiness problem?

  3. Anyone else have similar problem and/or configuration?

X-Status: 

Greetings All,

I am a new systems administrator of an IBM RS/6000 system running aix
3.2.5  I would like to use Pine for our in-house e-mail package.  I
have retrived the pine3.91.tar.Z file from ftp.cac.washington.edu and
placed it in the /pine directory on the RS.  Now for my newbie
questions:

1.  How do I extract the files from the pine3.91.tar.Z file?  Sorry, i
am also fairly new to AIX and Unix in general.

2.  What needs to be done next to make pine work in AIX?  I have
looked at the FAQ file and the information on the Pine Information
Center on the WWW.  the How to documentation starts with running pine
and sending messages.  

Any and all help is much appreciated.

Blatant testimonial - I've had a peek at the beta and it is a very slick

Many thanks Paul. I've done it your way. No one came up with a solution
to the problem I encountered with method 2. A good candidate for method 3
on the faq, and possibly a configurable option for a future release of Pine?

Greetings. I just started to compile PINE under MachTen 4.0 with the 
command :

 build mct

This chugged for a while and then died on the c-client, pico and pine.  I 
was able to get pico to compile by modifying the declaration for 
sys_errlist in the osdep file. It actually works too! :)

NOw when I compile Pine, it needs files from the c-client. Fine. I 
compile the c-client (doing these all with build mct's). And I get the 
messages:

bezerk.c:430: 'W_OK' undeclared (first use this function)

then I get ...

bezerk.c:1278: 'L_SET' undeclared (first use this function)

I grepped around and found that in the os_mnt.h file there is a 
definition of L_SET.  

The upshot of all this.  (1) Has anyone compiled Pine 3.91 on MachTen 4.0 
yet?  And, what do I need to change to get it to compile ?

Many thanks!

Michael

Okay I just compiled and installed pine (and sundry imap/pico stuff)
on my system and it all ran, yeah! BUT (there is always a but isn't
there?) EVERYTIME I run it, pine thinks this is the first time.  It
overwrites my .pinerc (happily ignoring the fact I had already set
it up) and then asks if I want to mail off that request.  

What is it looking for to determine if this is your first time?

Subject: Reading UNIX PINE folders with PC-PINE...
Date: 20 Sep 1995 16:42:36 GMT
Message-Id: <43pg9s$2uo@cnn.Princeton.EDU>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hi.

I saved some mail messages to a folder using PINE running on a
UNIX server.  I then ftp'ed the file to my hard drive.  I can read
the file using a text editor but PC-PINE refuses to recognize it
(I downloaded pcpine_w).

Is there a way to get PC-PINE to recognize the text file or does
it only work if it downloads the mail itself?

Alternatively, is there a utility that would convert the text file
that PINE saved into a text file that ELM can read (because I have
gotten ELM on my PC to read text files saved by UNIX ELM but, of
course, it won't read text files saved by PINE)?

Thank you.

Eddie

When I login into my computer as root and later try to read my mail as a user.
PINE ask me for userid and displays root.  I back space over root and type in
my userid and then my passwd.  However, the FROM line is always
root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xx instead of user@xxx.xxx.xxx.xx in sent messages.  Is there
a work around for this?

Thanks

Easy.  When you reply, pine will ask you whether want to post reply
to news groups (this question is before it goes into "compose mode").
Answer No and it will have you composing a reply to the original poster.

What is annoying (and the reason that I posted this instead of just
replying) is that it is not simple to do a "Follow-up and Reply".
I know how to do it, but I wish I could do it with fewer steps.

#1 is covered in my Filtering Mail FAQ and #2 is covered in the Pine
FAQ.  Both are accessible from:

I just received a copy of MachTen 4.0 today.  Unfortunately, my Mac is a
PB165c and MachTen 4.0 is for PPC Macs only.  I will check with Tenon to
determine the next step.

Please nag me about a week from now to learn the latest status of Pine for
MachTen 4.0.

I have heard that the current MachTen Pine binary starts under 4.0, but
quickly dies with an out of memory error.  It may not be feasible to run
Pine under 4.0.  4.0 does not offer virtual memory, and should be
considered to be a transitional release.  I would recommend staying with
MachTen 2.2 unless you need some of the new capabilities of 4.0, and wait
for 4.1 to come out.

You have a small problem!!!!!!
if you check ``/usr/include/sys/errno.h'', you will find that error 13 
refers to a permissions problem.  Security on you system is preventing
the writing of some files.  Perhaps the file belonged to another user,
prior to your attempted write; or you don't have permission to write in
the particular directory. Notice that the Error 13's have something in
common with each other --- they occur during the final linking phase.
This could indicate problems writing to the bin directory, or problems
accessing a given library.

Let me know what happens.

Yours Truely,

I'm crossposting this to comp.mail.pine in case any of the kind
folks there have any ideas... 

At least one of the affected users formerly used MM and has a
~/mail.txt file, and I think people with mail.txt files are the 
only ones affected since otherwise Pine wouldn't pull mail out 
of the spool without being asked.

One fix would be to shut off the periodic checks for new mail
for users with such files, but I haven't written a patch yet.
It seems kind of difficult to separate the periodic things we
do want (checkpointing) from the ones we don't (snarfing).

Thanks.

I have a couple of questions regarding imap and Pine.

I am running BSDI v2.0 on several machines.  One machine is the mail server.  
Users cannot access this machine except in Pine (or other imap client).

When attaching a file from a machine (other than the mail server) we get the 
message:
		error in postioning attachment.

The file does attach and is sent.  However users are upset with the message.  
What is causing the message?

The authentication you are doing by providing a username and password 
applies only to the *reading* of e-mail over IMAP.  Sending mail is quite 
separate from IMAP (it either pipesinto sendmail on the local machine or 
uses a nominated SMTP server) and can be performed without an IMAP 
connection (eg, try "pine e-mail-address").

As a result mail you send out is always stamped with the username you are 
logged in under (for security/identification reasons I presume).

Perhaps you instead need to look at adding a "Reply-to:" header and 
setting this to your own personal e-mail address?

Sorry if this question has been asked already.
I can't seem to figure out how to include an "attribution" in my

included message looking something like this:

On XXX time, user XXX wrote:    <---- this is what I am getting at

Is this possible?  Thanks.

It is not possible to customise the "attribution" in Pine 3.91 (short of 
modifying and recompiling the source code, of course).

I *think* I recall the Pine Development Team saying it would be 
configurable in Pine 3.92.  (But don't quote me on this! ;-)

suggestions as to how to convince pine to lengthen itself to 40 lines or 
something. My modem is pretty speedy, so I am less concerned about scroll 
speed than I am being able to read more than a small portion of the text 
at a time. I tried changing the term to various things, but I always seem 
to end up with something that looks like vt100.

The command to build Pine under MachTen is "build mct" while connected to
the pine3.91/ directory.  It does not work to invoke the makefiles
directly.

A pre-built Pine binary for MachTen is on ftp.cac.washington.edu in
pine/unix-bin

Did you use ASCII or BINARY mode?
On unix, the line terminator is LF, but if you ftp'd in ASCII mode these 
will have been converted to CR,LF, which PCPine mmay not like.


Alternatively, maybe you got it in binary mode, but PC-Pine wants CR,LF
To fix this, load the file into MS Edit, type a space and delete it
(change the file) and save it.

But whatever :- try ftp'ing in the opposite mode.

VMS/PINE 3.89 does not support attachments. V3.91 does it.

I am in the middle of trying to connect my local machines to a mail 
server and am running into a few problems.  I was hoping someone might be 
able to offer some assistance.  

Setup:
We are running an internal network using TCP/IP to the user desktop.  We 
have a seperate machine (not on the net) connected to the Internet.  the 
Internet connection is currently accessed by executing a 'cu' command to 
that machine (both our Unix hosts are connected via a null modem) from 
the Unix host.  We can then run Pine etc on the inet host.  I have 
installed imapd on that machine and am trying to figure a way to connect 
to that host using bang path expansion from the desktop machines. 

This is where I am running into trouble.  Could anyone offer any 
pointers?  TIA for any info.  Please send responses via private email as 
I am more likely to get it that way.  Thanks..

blank page.

We have a DEC ALPHA machine (DEC Unix) and access the mainframe from 
terminals and PC's using kermit and an old communication package called 
Zstem. We use mostly HP Deskjets, Deskjet Plusses, some Epsons. No 
combination of terminal/PC/printer seems to print entire message to 
attached printer whether "preserve_start_stop_characters" is on or off.

Any help is appreciated.

thanks!

One other thing, are there any user manuals available for current
versions of, in my case, pine in the unix environment?

You may find there are several ways around this:

1. login in as yourself first and only su to root. If your on a multi user
system this has the additional benefit of not exposing root to login 
spoofing.

2. When you switch user use the syntax 
	su - <user> 
The effect varies with different OS/s and system configurations (some sysops 
prevent changes to LOGNAME) but essentially su <user> changes the 
effective id, su - <user> changes the effective id and sets the 
environment to the login environment of <user>. Under solaris 2.4 which 
I'm using currently this includes changing LOGNAME and effects the change 
you want for pine.

3. Login as root and configure pine (either through set up or editing
./pinerc) to set 'personal name' to what ever you prefer your mail will 
then be received as something like

	From: "Paul Weber" <root@psg.com>

You can combine this with configuring an additional header as
	Reply-To: weber@psg.com

which will give recipients the choice of where to reply to. (Pine prompts
for this when replying to e-mail with a Reply-To: field.

If you are the regular sysop for psg.com you might also put 
	weber
in your /.forward file so that if anyone does reply to root@psg.com its
forwarded straight to you.

After perusing every doc I could find (and looking for a digest of this 
list), I'm at a loss for getting the Bug Report address changed.  We are 
preparing (finally) to upgrade from 3.05 to 3.91 and I must admit that my 
users are somewhat unresponsive to any guidance, but rather openly do 
things that would certainly be a bother to the development team.

I've set the real name and address in both pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed 
and start with a fresh account.  When I test the bug report option, it 
still address to the development team.  Is that where it would really go? 
I'd rather the questions filter through me as the Sys Admin.

Any hints much appreciated as we are ready to go live with the new 
version in the wee hours of Friday morning.

Howdy,

I was wondering if some could point me to a list of changes made to Pico 
between version 2.3 and 2.5? We just installed 3.91 of Pine into 
production, and would like to keep the latest version of Pico as an 
external editor too.

Thanks!

Dear Developers,

In the expectation of 3.92, I have the following concern.

When Pine attaches files to messages, it has to make a decision which 
encoding to use. I would expect it to make a decision, based on the data 
in the file. Currently, Pine encodes as BASE64 everything, which does not 
promote the smooth transition to MIME. 

I searched the pine-info archives and didn't find any explanation on why 
this is so.

If it is difficult or unfeasible to analyze every attachment, I would 
propose having another key in the header editing besides ^J, that 
attachest a text file.

Is there a way to limit users to just their home directory in pico,

At my agency some users have network access through Sun workstations and 
others are on Novell.  We recently get email connectivity between Unix 
and Novell.  My question, how do you sent binary files between the two 
using Pine and Groupwise?

These two email softwares seem not to recognise each other's 
attachments.  How do I decode them? 

Thanks!

I'm continuing my struggle to install Winsock Pine under Windows 95.  
Could anyone who has Winsock Pine running send me a copy of your PINERC 
for comparison?  Should a PINERC that works with a different version of 
PC Pine also work with the Winsock version?  Thanks.

Subject: Help on PINE's margin settings

Hi,

I would like to ask a question about PINE's margins. I wanted to set the number 
of characters per line to 70 characters only.  In others words, I would
like PINE to wrap the line to the next one after 70 chars.
I looked in the .pinerc file, but they don't have any setting for that.
Or is it my impression that PINE doesn't have margin settings.

Thanx in advance.

Regards,
-EG-

You need to apply the attached patch to the Pine 3.91 sources and
recompile...

You can add an entry to all of your entries in the adressbook telling pine which Fcc-Folder 
to use (From the (M)ain menu go to (A)dressbook, choose (E)dit and the (G) for FCC)


Ciao,
 Michael

PS: For the rest of your question ask any good FAQ on PINE and Filtering ;-)

Here is the latest news about Pine 3.91 and MachTen 4.0:

I received a copy of MachTen 4.0 the other day.  Unfortunately, my Mac is
68K based so I can't run it, but I have received permission from Tenon to
run 4.0 on a borrowed PPC for the purposes of getting Pine ported.

However, Tenon also advises me that an update to MachTen 4.0 is coming out
shortly, and includes important fixes to memory allocation code.  Since
Pine is a large application, the fact that the soon-to-be-fixed memory
allocation problems in 4.0 "significantly inflate" its memory requirements
is important.

So, please sit tight for a few weeks until the update is out and I've had
the chance to work on it.  Remember that MachTen 4.0 is very new, and "you
can always tell the pioneers -- they're the guys with the arrows in their
back."

I find it very difficult to believe that Pine is "slurp[ing] all incoming
mail messages out of [the] mail spool file [and not] sav[ing] them
anywhere."  The mail.txt copying code is very specific in requiring
confirmation that the data was saved for all messages before emptying the
spool file.  The messages should be in ~/mail.txt in that case.

Nor do I see any way that being disconnected would affect the behavior of
this code.  There are some known bugs in hang-up handling that will cause
loops, but that is in a completely different section of Pine code
unrelated to mail.txt handling.

Please have your local system support send a report to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu with as many details of the problem as
possible.

Now, from your home computer go back to your unix server, that file should
be in your 'home' directory on your unix server, just (d)ownload it (that
filename) to your home pc.

Yer welcome ... now don't forget ... you now have 3 copies of this

Hello,

I am using PCPine on a TCP/IP network, and
continue to receive the error message:
"out of free storage." I am then placed back at the Dos prompt.

I have tried puting Pine in different subdirectories, and the
message still comes up.

The message displays when I try to read a message
in my inbox, or sometimes when the inbox loads
(after entering my password).  I have also gotten
this type of error while trying to compose a message.

Any help or ideas with this would be greatly
appreciated.  I have spent the last three to four
hours trying evreything I could think of to no avail.

Thanks,
Mika Pyyhkala

Hi all,
Help from anyone with experience on the mailcap facility of pcpine is
much appeciated.
My question is that is there a way to specify in mailcap  so
that pine creates a specific MIME content-type header based on
the file extension? (e.g. 

	application/msword	for .DOC
	application/msexcel	for .XLS
)
 
This will help pcpine to launch a specific program based on the content-type
of the message. e.g. in mailcap

	application/msword;c:\winword/winword.exe %s
	application/msexcel;c:\excel/excel.exe %s


So far when I attached a Microsoft Word document to the message, the mime
content-type header shows

	Content-type:application/octet-stream; file="AAA.DOC"

Thanks in advance.

You don't say what the error is (it's always a help to give this!).

However the most likely message is something like "Bus error" and/or 
"Core dumped".  If so, then the problem does not lie with Pine, but with 
the version of the "sendmail" mail delivery program installed on your system.

A security problem was discovered in a previous version of sendmail and 
new release was made available which fixed the probem.  Unfortunately it, 
too, had a bug in it, which caused it to crash when attempting to deliver 
a message to alist of more than (about) 20 people.

Check the version of your system's sendmail program, and make sure it is 
upgraded to the most recent (which I think is version 8.6.12).

This is not something Pine is responsible for.  Pine is a "Mail User 
Agent" (MUA) which simply reads mail *after* it has been delivered into 
your mailbox.

To redirect your mail elsewhere you need to persuade the program that 
actually does the delivery -- the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) -- to do so.  
On most UNIX systems this is a program called "sendmail".  This allows 
incoming mail to be redirected (and processed in other ways) by you 
setting up a file called ".forward" in your home directory.

Read the manual page on sendmail (man sendmail) for information on how to
do this, or contact your local computer support centre/person.

Put all of the email addresses in the To: line separated by commas (",").

Example:

To: iano@scripps.edu, art41250@leonis.nus.sg

would send the message to both me and you.

A copy of the e-mail will also be sent to e-mail addresses included in 
the Cc: line and the Bcc: line.

To use an inbox on 2 different machines, you need set 2 options/parameters

This works with me during a test.

It depends a little on what environment you are running pine in and what
enviroment the recipient is operating under. For simple text files in a
windows environment of some sort, you can just cut and paste into pine. 
This tends to destroy the formatting (boldface, italics, underlines, etc.)
In all environments, you can import text docs in using the "Read File"
command (^R from the "Message Text" area of the outgoing message). Any
non-text file or save file from a word processor which does not save as
pure text can be sent as a attachment. Just type in the path (location of
the file in your computer's file system) of the file into the Attchmnt
line in the subject are of the outgoing message. This method encodes files
in MIME format. The e-mail recipient will need to have a MIME capable
e-mail reader like pine, eudora or Zmail to read it. Lastly, standard mac
files and applications can be binhex-ed using binhex 4.0 or a variety of
other programs and then opened in a word processor as text (looks like
many many lines of random characters.) Cut and paste the text into your
outgoing message. The recipient can then cut out the binhex portion of the
e-mail message and save that as a file and then unbinhex it. If you were a
little more specific as to what sort of computer system you are using,
what kind of file you intend to send and what sort of system you are
sending to, I could offer a more explicit and helpful response.

Eddie,
Why not just S (Save) the messages from the Unix folder to a folder 
on your PC, when you use PC-Pine and is connected to the Unix ??

Just delete the last news article and turn the
news-approximates-new-status option on under Setup/Config from the main
menu. (Actually do this in the reverse order.) The articles will still be
there, but they will not appear as new and when you start the news group
it will skip to the first new one.

For messages delivered to our local domain "Cranfield.ac.uk" sent

%PMDF-I-VERSION, PMDF version is PMDF V5.0-3

Mail is not delivered with the following error returned (from PMDF Mail 
Server)

  Reason: 554 No Resent-From field given

I am afraid that I don't really know how our mail aliasing works here,
and I know nothing about VMS, but I should point out that this
does work correctly with mail sent using PMDF MAIL, so the error
lies in some Pine/PMDF interaction.

In a possibly related question, where is "user-domain" set for VMS Pine?
It is not set in our pine.conf-fixed, (or pine.conf) but when I try
to set it from Setup/Config, I am told that the value is fixed.

Thanks,

we use SCO 3.2v4.2; 

su - <user>

causes pine to read the su'd users mail, yet the standard "mail" mailer 
still reads the original "logname" mail.

Yes. Use your preferred editor to create a file called ~/.forward, 
containing the e-mail address you want your mail forwarded to.  You can 
also have more than one address in the file, on individual lines, or 
separated by commas or tabs, and your mail will be forwarded to each of 
them. 

If you want your mail forwarded AND a copy kept in your inbox on your 
account, put your address in the file as well.  You MUST precede your 
address with a backslash (\), or the system may try to forward the mail 
back to your address over and over and over again, in an infinite loop.  
Hope this helps.  G'Day.

Pine 3.91 does have margin settings but they are hardcoded in the
source code.  I was told that user controlled margins would be
available in the next release.  Till then, you might consider using
the alternate editor facility.

I have just installed PC-PINE (WinSock). I am using my VAX as an IMAP 
server with PMDF. How do I make PC-PINE go back and check the server for 
new messages automatically? It seems the only way that I can see the new 
messages is by exiting PINE and re-invoking it.

Ever notice that if you take too long to reply to an email using the IMAP
server that the connection gets broken?

I use pine on a remote system, connect to my mail system, and if I take
too long to reply to a message I want to reply to, the connection closes :-(

I then have to save what I've typed so far, exit pine, which displays 
a few "imap broken connection" messages, or some such, then start pine
again with a fresh connection.

I will try and get as much detailed information as I can, from people
who suffered the problem. They told me that their new mail was
vanishing, that the messages were lost. Presumably if it was in
~/mail.txt, Pine would show it as being in their INBOX folder? (maybe
it was just a "user error" false alarm?)

Pine would be my all time favorite news reader if...

I could easily mark the current subject as read.  Yes, I know that
I can

i     // index
;     // select
t     // text
s     // subject
^X    // current subject
a     // apply
d     // delete

obviously that is too many keystrokes, but the real problem with that
is that when pine does a text/subject search on news, it appears to
grab each and every message off of the news server!.  Any suggestions
or fixes in the future would be very welcome.

Or you can set it in your communications program.  Now don't laugh, under
Windowzz ... Accessories - Terminal - Settings - Text Transfer - you can
set word (W)rap outgoing text to any column # you want ... 70 is good ... 
Windows terminal default 79 is NFG.  I assume other communications
programs have similar optional settings.  G'Day.

X-Status: 

When I bounce a message in pine, pine adds Resent-Date, Resent-From,
and Resent-To lines.  I'm bouncing mail to a large group of people,
and I don't want the Resent-To line (which contains the list of people
to which I am bouncing) to appear in the sent mail.  How do I remove
the lines?

I guess I'm looking for a cross between BCC and bounce, where the
sender of the original message still remains the sender, and the list
of people to which the mail is sent is kept hidden.

Thanks in advance!

Tien,
This capability is the function of the .mime.types file, rather than
.mailcap, which defines what to do when you *receive* an attachment.

Version 3.92 will support a .mime.types file.

There has never been a Mac version of Pine, unfortunately, and the fine
folks at the University of Washington don't seem to be planning one in the
near future. However, all is not lost. If you want a very nice IMAP mail
client for the Mac, check out:

http://ackmo.baylor.edu/files/Mail_Drop/info.html

Be sure to get adventurous and try out the 1.2d3b version. It'll give you
a good idea where MailDrop is going.

Cheers,

Actually, there is a project going on to investigate the feasibility of a
Mac port, and it's progressed quite a bit further than my earlier effort
of over a year ago.  Stay tuned to this channel for more details!

Mail Drop is a fine Mac GUI client, and I recommend it highly.

In Pine, you can define something called "inbox-path", which specifies
what you get when you open "INBOX" in Pine (or open the default mailbox).
If this is blank, Pine opens "INBOX", which is what the internal library
(c-client) used by Pine thinks is your INBOX.

So, if somehow the user got himself into a state where, from Pine, his
inbox-path is /usr/spool/mail/$USER or {server}/usr/spool/mail/$USER, then
if he then does something to open INBOX or {server}INBOX when there is a
~/mail.txt file, his mail will seem to have vanished when he then opens by
using the absolute path name of /usr/spool/mail/$USER.

It's a fairly far-fetched set of circumstances, and I would recommend an
investigation before jumping to such contorted conclusions.  However, I
will go as far as to say that it is almost never right to set inbox-path
to a /usr/spool/mail path.  If you want the default INBOX, leave it blank.

So, whether this is some wierd bug or user error is still unresolved.  But
the first thing to check is the inbox-path in his configuration; also
check to see if the "lost" messages ended up in mail.txt or some other
obvious file in his home directory.

Take a look at one of your mail "folders" -- if your site is set up like 
ours (University of Washington), a "folder" is really just a file.  Thus, 
you could either...

     1. Attach the "folder" (file) with the ^J command (or just put
	"mail/folder-name" on the "Attchmnt:" header.

     2. Read (^R) the "folder" (file) into the body of the message.

Keep in mind that this includes a lot of (probably unnecessary) header 
info at the beginning of each message.

Alternatively, if you're using Pine 3.90 or later, check out the 
"Enable-Aggregate-Command-Set" option in the config menu.  This allows 
you to select multiple messages (eg. "select all") and apply a command 
(eg. forward) to all of them.

Hope that helps.

Hello,

I am using PCPine for Dos version 3.9 with a TCP/IP network
connection.

When I try to read a message, I get an error message
of "out of free storage," and am returned to the C prompt.
I can look at the directory of messages, just not read
one.  This also takes place when composing messages.

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  There is plenty
of space left on the hard disk and pine has about 360/412 
K of convention memory to work with.

Thanks,
Mika Pyyhkala

Thanks for the praise.  For most people, the IMAP support has worked
without a hitch -- still a couple of small kinks to work out.  I just
finished the cc:Mail support last night, so that part goes into beta
now.

The help file will be last (hang on!).  You can look at the current
help file by downloading the current version from
winftp.cica.indiana.edu:/pub/pc/win3/util/wnbff30a.zip.  Of course,
that says nothing about IMAP, but most of what's in there about POP3
applies.  

I'm still expecting this release to go out mid-October.

    This is not really a Pine question.  Whether or not a given newsgroup 
is available to you depends on the particular system you are logged into, 
whether or not they carry it so that it could be read by _any_ 
newsreader, not just Pine.  Check with your Help Desk or system 
administrator.

To send to more than one email address simply enter first address 
then a comma (,) the next address etc.

if u have a group u mail to often then creat a list in ur 
personal addressbook and u simply need to enter the list name and 
not all the individual addresses.

	This effing message has been in EVERY NEWSGROUP I've read this
morning!  Not only that, I had to look at this same crap a couple weeks
ago on some of my mailing lists!  Why is a clown who's purportedly running
for office in New Mexico posting from Wisconsin?  How did he manage to get
into every newsgroup I've read?  This guy is a spamming fraud but he seems
like a hard-worker.  I mean, the only way he could infect all these
groups, without cross-posting, is by typing in each newsgroup separately,
right? 

	Mr. Glasrud, if you HAVE to inflict this fraudulent crap on us,
LEARN TO CROSS-POST!

I've found the answer and will share it for any others who might be 
affected.  My PINERC under PC Pine for Lan Workplace contained numeric IP 
addresses throughout (thus saving unnecessary DNS access, I assumed).  
This worked fine until I loaded the Windows version to run under the 
Windows 95 TCP/IP Winsock.  Suddenly, numeric IPs will not work at all, 
but names seem to work perfectly?  I'm not sure whether this is related 
to Windows 95 or Windows Pine, but my problem is solved.  Thanks to all 
who responded.

Many thanks,

I am trying to run Pine For Dos version 3.9 with
a tcp/ip network.

I was able to get the program to start running a few days ago.
However, now when I launch pine from the C prompt
I get the message:
run time error r6009 not enough space for environment

I restored my config.sys and autoexec.bat files to the way that
they were set a couple of days ago; when
Pine was starting ok, rebooted the
computer, and still get this error message.
I looked in the docs which are available by
FTP and cannot seem to locate a more detailed explanation
of what thie error means or how to correct the
problem.

Does anyone know what the error means, or what to
do?

Thanks in advance,

I don't know of a commercially published book on pine but there is a
wealth of material available on the Internet.

The first place to look is in pine's own online documentation.  Simply
invoke the help command from the main menu.

A very good introduction to pine was supplied to me by Suzanne Nanis
<nanis@strauss.udel.edu>.  You can check with her on obtaining a copy
or I can send you the version I have.

If you have access to the www, Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com> has put
together a mail and news page that claims to have an exhaustive list
of sources of information on pine.  Its at:

Pine allows you to use an IP address in place of a host name but expects
literal IP addresses to be enclosed in square brackets ([]).  Addresses in
brackets get converted by pine.  Addresses (and names) not in brackets get
passed to the TCP/IP software for resolution.  _Some_ TCP/IP
implementations are smart enough to recognize an IP address and do the
simple translation.  _Others_ do not recognize when they have been passed
an IP address and will try to resolve it as a host name, which will always
fail.

If your IP addresses were not in brackets that may explain why one TCP/IP
implementation worked for pine and another did not.

If your IP addresses were in brackets then there is a bug and I'ld like to
know about it.

Hello All --

This question is for universities using pine as their primary e-mail 
interface.

We are running pine 3.91 on an DEC Alpha 3300 with V2.0 of OSF.

We're considering setting a diskquotas on our /usr/spool/mail/userid
directories in order to limit the amount of mail users can receive.  The
purpose is to prevent users from collecting large amounts of mail (and
thus using up large amounts of diskspace.)

I would like to know if any of the other universities out there have 
adopted this practice.  If so, what type of limits are being set for the 
/usr/spool/mail/userid directories and the users own home directories.

Please respond to me directly, and I'll post a summary.

UNIX Pine comes with imapd, ipop3d, and ipop2d (I think).  
Normal installation only configures imapd.  It is preferable to 
use imapd (which is what all pine clients use -- and I don't 
think they can use POP, but don't quote me).  Imapd differs in 
that clients establish and keep open a connection with the 
server when pine is started.  POP clients, on the other hand, 
check in with the mail server and post new mail as necessary.  
The mail program tries to minimize the time connections remain 
open.  POP is more suitable in a modem or ISDN environment 
where users are trying to minimize connection time.

So in brief, the PINE server fully supports imapd and POP.  
However, the clients (to the best of my knowledge) only support 
imapd.

Best of luck,
Tom Steck

Indeed, this is true.  Even with a direct ethernet connection, 
this occurs.  I'm sure it's even more prevalent over a modem.  
It appears that Pine is not too graceful handling network 
errors.  It would be nice if Pine could at least reestablish 
clobbered connections without having to restart Pine itself.

Perhaps the long overdue next version!!!

This is not a real answer to your question, but one option is to
use encryption for your mail messages.  If people sent you encrypted
mail it would also protect you from accidently reading each others
mail.  A really outstanding encryption system (using public key encryption
so that you don't have lots of different passwords to keep track of) is
PGP.  One way to find out about PGP is by mailing to
 galactus@stack.urc.tue.nl
with the Subject
 HELP PGP

If you use pgp and pine on Unix then the mkpgp shell script helps
integrate the two very well.  I can sign, encrypt, decrypt and verify
signatures without every having to leave pine.
mkpgp will be available most places that pgp is available from.

I'm having trouble with pico.  It runs perfectly in xterms, but
misbehaves in hpterms.  The cursor movement mapping in the hpterm is
just plain wrong.

I've tried playing with the TERM environment variable (per suggestions
of the hpterm man page) but nothing seems to fix the problem.

I observe that moving the cursor (that little white box) with the
arrow keys in an hpterm does not move the actual insertion point of
text.

Although I'm confident this is a FAQ, I was unable to locate the
answer in the pine FAQ.  Please cc: me on any followups. My newsfeed,
sadly, has been spotty :(

TIA!

My worry would be what happens when the mail delivery agent can't write to
disc? I've never tested this out but presumably a lot of additional mail 
could be generated, (to the local postmaster, the sender and the 
senders postmaster. If the whole thing doesn't fall over it is quite 
possible that the mail transport agent at the other end will try to resend
every 15 minutes for 3 days (a common default for sendmail). Perhaps someone
can confirm what actually happens?

To forestall this possibility I set a limit of 1000 blocks for mail. A script
is run from cron to check the size of each persons system mail box. A warning
is issued at 800 blocks, and at 1000 blocks or over the mail box is archived
into the user area, which is quotaed (with a standard limit of 8192 blocks)
(NB under Solaris 2.x the logical blocks used for  checking file  size are
512 bytes where as the quota blocks are 1k)

This of course begs the question of what do you do when the user has exceeded
both the mailbox limit and their quota. As things stand at the moment we'd
be back to square one, but fortunately this hasn't happened yet. What would
others do?

I should perhaps say that 8Mb of user space and 1/2 Mb of mail space would
be thought rather small by many of our users, and I might if pushed, 
agree with them.

I know I can manually edit the .pinerc to reply from the appropriate

One of my favorite features of Pine, and one of the many reasons
it's better than Elm, is the ability to flag messages.  Right now
the only possibilities are:

  Flag New, Deleted, Answered, or Important ?

which are flagged with N, D, A, and * respectively.

It would be great if Pine 3.92 had more flags available, e.g., I'd
really like to be able to distinguish between messages that I

  * need to respond to
  * want to read again
  * will probably want to refer to later

Are there any plans for more flags in 3.92?

Thanks much,

I have seen pine do this to mail.  It is extremely odd and irregular.
It does not take mail from your spool instantly.  If you are online for
a "short" (havn't fingured out exactly how long short is) it does leave
you mail in spool.  But if you have been logged out for several hours
with pine running.  Your mail will dissapear.

I observed it on a person's account on the suncluster and I tried
sending him mail.  The only common thread was that their would be a
substantial (he was not logged in for 30+ minutes) between when the
mail was sent and when he received it.  If he was logged in he could
get it.  I don't have a clue as to what it was doing.  I also saw
someone who had it running all weekend and didn't recieve a thing from
that weekend.  He didn't login at all over the weekend.

Do you mean PC Pine 3.91, or an earlier version?

This message occurs when a malloc() to get a memory buffer fails.

Ah, there's your problem.  You need more conventional memory.  You're
short by at least 100K.  Try running Microsoft's MEMMAKER to move some of
your TSRs, etc. to upper memory.

It's really not too taxing...

Assuming you are using Pine 3.91 go to the Setup Configuration screen 
(type S then C from the Main Menu) and select the "enable-bounce-cmd" 
item in the feature list.  Leave the screen by typing E.

There, it's configured!

I'm not sure how you're hoping this will moderate a newsgroup: Bounce 
lets you bounce a message to another *e-mail* address, not to a newsgroup.

I find it adequate to define any additional headers I need (eg, 
"Reply-to", "Followup-to" etc).  When an article for approval arrives via 
e-mail I then Forward it (F command) and set up the headers (^R - Rich 
Headers) to send it to a newsgroup instead of an e-mail address.  A quick 
bit of fiddling with the subject text (remove the trailing " (fwd)") and 
setting up any other headers prepares the article for posting.

  Unix pine client does support POP3, although there are some errors in
the code (some users announced it and the patch here, I never met it) and
it doesn't allow you (in my best knowlidge) to delete messages on the
server.

Well, again and again, I tried to set it to "last-folder-used," but for 
some darn reason, pine would always change to "by-from" soon or later -- 
very uncooperative. Does anyone know a permanent fix for this?

This pine is ver 3.91 running on HP-UX.

My university had a cron job and if your mailbox was too big it would be 
copied to your own directory and then be subject to your own quota's, 
meaning: you can't create any files until you deal with your mail...

The file was called oldmail, in the users own Mail directory, presumably, 
if it happended twice before they could deal with it, they'd loose the 
first lot.

If this happened its either because of a delinquent user who is absent, 
or they are being mail bombed, either way they'll never manage to read it 
all...

Dear Pine development team,

I regret but I have to ask the above question.  I know it's irritating but
I am sure a lot of users would like to ask it too.  I understand that it
is a free software.  Having that said, we don't have any reasons to even
ASK for an upgrade or new version.  But, hey, I am a Pine advocate and I
almost couldn't write email without it. :)

We also understand that there IS a new version coming out and it's been 
almost a year since the last upgrade, is it the right time that we should 
have Pine 95? :)

I am sorry if you are annoyed.

Yours,
Keith

Multiple folders no longer cut it for managing my email.  Does anyone know
of an Elm friendly email database?  It would be nice if it supported the
addition of keywords to messages, searches based upon keywords, contents
and date ranges, and use of a compressed database would be nice. 

Please email me replies :-)

Thanks

	That question gets asked from time to time.  The answer has been, and I'm
sure will continue to be, "no comment at the present time".  In the past
the Pine Team had made projections as to when the next release would
be ready.  As you might expect, these targets were rarely accurate and
as a result the Pine Team took unnecessary flack for missing their
projected release dates.  For some reason some people actually were
quite disturbed that this *free* software wasn't released when "promised".
So, the Pine Team made the decision not to announce a target date until
they were 100% sure that they could make the date.  Indeed, they don't
even predict a quarter when it might be released.

	So, I feel the best that can be said is the release of Pine 3.92
will not be as soon as you would like and neither will it be an eternity.
And, as past releases have shown, it will be worth the wait.

	Regards,
		 Ed

Hi

I select subscribe when in the News Collection, and type ^T to retrieve
the entire set of newsgroups.  After subscribing to one of these groups,
however, I end up back in the News Collection List display and have to
start over again.  Something I read on some homepage led me to believe
that one could subscribe to multiple groups after retrieving the set once. 
I could not see anyway to mark newsgroups (and aggregate commands don't
seem to work in that screen anyway), or to prevent Subscribing to a
particular group from returning to List display, so is it indeed possible
to subscribe to more than one of the groups after retrieving the list with
^T?  This would be desirable because: (a) we have a remote newsfeed so
retrieval of the list takes some time, and (b) when doing a search for a
particular pattern it is necessary to start the search from the beginning
each time and skip over groups that you have already ignored or added one 
or more times prior to the latest search.

Take care
Jim

I guess I quickly should have corrected myself -- I'm a Pine user 
through-and-through, well with the exception of Elm's filter program :-)

I asked before but I have received no response so here it is again...
I have compiled pine on my NetBSD system and I find that everytime I run
the program I get the message "Would you like to be emailed more 
information?" It also overwrites my .pinerc file.  Whether I use the 
built in setup menu or edit it with vi.  

Any suggestions on how I might fix this would be helpful.

Is is possible to share a mail folder between several different users in 
pine? What I would like to do is establish a mail folder in a certain 
directory and give others users access to it so they can do everything to 
the folder that they would be able to do if the folder was located in 
their own mail folder.

Any help is appreciated

I've read all the documentation I can find, and its not explained very

Can someone tell me how to do this?

I am running pine under win95 and I have no problem.  I could not get it 
to work trying to log directly into a pop server, so I got my mail 
forwarded to another account where it uses the usual unix mail system.  It 
works great, I just use my inpox-path as {computer.name.edu} and leave the 
actual inbox directory blank.  Pine finds my mail (even though I can't).

I also have no problems with importing a file from other directories or 
drives.

    From the Main Menu, go into Setup, then Config.  Cursor down to the 
customized headers entry and press A for add.  Type in

        Return-Receipt-To: whomever

and exit.

I just have to say, "I am annoyed."  Who cares when the next version comes
out?  There are no horrific bugs in 3.91, no major flavors of UNIX that
3.91 will not compile on, etc.  Pine is an excellent program that would
stand on its own without any more updates.  As best as I can tell, having
been watching this group for some time, is that there is no list of promised
features, or any other word from UW about 3.92, that would place it in the
category of "hotly awaited vaporware."  Go pester Microsloth or something.

Alternatively you can try my Mac IMAP client - 'Mulberry'. Its currently in final
beta with a demo version due in a couple of weeks for general release. In the meantime
I can send you the beta to have a look at. Email me direct at cd102@phy.cam.ac.uk if
you are interested. Mulberry's features include:

o Support for multiple mailboxes.
o Recording of outgoing mail in any mailbox.
o Fully configurable mailbox windows.
o Address book that supports groups of addresses as well.
o Full drag and drop capability for virtually any item (messages, addresses, and
any text).

    I had the same problem at first.  I use the Unix C shell, and all I=20
had to do to get the backspace key to work was to put the following=20
statement in my .login file:

        stty erase ^H

There may be something similar (i.e., similar files) for other shells.

Add the line
customized-hdrs        = Return-Receipt-To: me@myaddress.here.there
(defaults to blank)
to your .pinerc using the Setup Configuration option or by editing the file directly.

Works for me.

Hiya,
	Been using Pine for about six months now on a RISC/6000 server.  Just recently
it started crashing system wide for all users (about 20).  The debug and crash
out put are little help other than to tell me that the cause of the crash was
an "auger_in_signal()" call which caused the crash.  I've dug around in the
code for Pine3.91 and can't find what would call this signal.  Is the binary
just bad?  Could it be Imap?  The crashes occur seemingly unpredictably and can
happen while composing mail or just browsing around.  I'm going to play with it
to see if it could be the recieving of mail but from the debug file it doesn't
look that way.  Any offerings of advice would be appreciated.

thanks,

For inbox, we have soft limit (warning) of 100K and a hard limit of 50MB 
(cannot exceed this). FYI, our home directores got soft limit of 500K and 
hard limit of 1MB (yeah, very stingy). If the user oversteps the time 
limit for quota three times (1.5 months for inbox and 4 weeks for home 
directories), they are permanently taken off the system and has do deal 
with the computer resource department to explain their actions and 
possible reinstallment of the account.

I do not want the Bcc addresses listed in the text (surprise!).  Can

Hello All,

Does anyone know of a program, or Pine feature, that would allow a Dos

For example, a beep when you have new mail, regardless of what program 
you are in at the time.

Thanks,

the whole screen becomes garbled with options, and the ispell checker 
says spelling checked when it doesnt.
Here is what i did, which is what the FAQ says to do.
Q where ispell
A util/bin/ispell
ln -s /util/bin/ispell $HOME/spell
this created a link called spell, linked to ispell in util/bin/ispell
then i created a file called ispell.words using emacs, in which i entered 
a line at a time a few words, and my email address, each entry on a 
seperate line.
then in my .cshrc i did
setenv SPELL "$HOME/spell"
sourced the .cshrc file, and enabled the alternative editor within 
.pinerc to alt. editor = util/bin/emacs (gotten from where emacs command 
in unix).
Logged out and logged in.
Everything fine, except at Ctrl T, when the screen goes crazy, totally 
hidying the screen, and no matter how many space_bars or returns u type, 
it stays. If u email it your self, u still see the errors, which it 
supposedly "corrected".
Any help please, 
P.S i do not want to use .pico as my editor, i much prefer emacs
TIA


			Love, Peace & Respect Jaz ........

hi!

we use pine (on linux) and pmail (pegasus mail on netware) here in our 
campus.  more and more are using the file attach feature of both mail 
programs.

pmail uses base64 encoding/decoding for file attaches.  how can a 
base64-encoded mail message be read using pine?  is there a way?

please send your reply to me via mail (cscspm@nntp.dlsu.edu.ph).

many thanks!

(in connection with a complicated listserv problem)
can one do something to control the Content-Transfer-Encoding?
does anyone know?
(this is different from content-type and charset,
and we are talking about message body, not attachments)

also, you should be aware that you can put lists of addresses
in your addressbook
to make a list there,
in the addressbook, press S
enter the name for the list, etc, just follow instructions
which will tell you to enter names and addresses
until you have no more to enter and you just press ENTER

if that is part of what you were asking about, try it
it's really handy

I had the same problem recently, although no-one was able to offer a direct
solution Paul Shuman came up with this which I now use.

Enable the alternate editor (which you already have done for emacs) but
leave the 'editor' selection blank. When you select alternate editor
during a compose you will be prompted for an editor name (pine actually
prompts you with the value of VISUAL or EDITOR if set, I'm not sure
which) when you want to edit enter emacs, when you want to spell use
ispell. Its a little bet of fag to have exit but not much and you get the
full utility of both.

Going on from there, it would be nice if there were to be: 

     1.	An update to the FAQ a) resolving the problems with method 2
	                     b) offering the above method 3
     2. An indication that the configuration of different editors 
        and spelling checkers will be included in some future 
        release.

Please reply to him, not me!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      I haven't been able to write to the pine server through the 
newssgroup so I was wondering if you could forward this for me to it.  

        I was wondering if there is anyway to reconfigure the system so 
that it will print at my personal computer instead of the university 
where it is based.  When I try to print my mail it goes there.

Thank you

There are many mailers out there, which can't handle 8-bit characters
in the headers, but works fine with 8-bit in the text.

Do anybody know if it is possible to insert a pound sign in a message in 
a way so that everybody can read it (even if they are reading it on a PC)?

No answers, just a suggestion. You could try copying the .pinerc 
somewhere else, edit, then start pine using pine -pfilename.
I use this to select editors, use mkpgp, select character sets :-( etc

I think it is the entry :

# Version of Pine used last session (set automatically)
last-version-used=3.91

that is being checked. You could compare with what the source says.

	If you type "which cc" do you get something like /usr/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
or do you get /usr/ucb/cc?  You should get the former.  If you get
/usr/ucb/cc then fix your PATH such that it is after .../SUNWpro/bin.
Another common source (ouch) of trouble is have the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set.  If you have it set....unset it and try again.

Well, if by DOS you mean DOS/Windows, the next version of my
WinBiff program will do exactly this.  The IMAP support works
flawlessly now.

I expect to release this within a couple of weeks.  Watch this
space.

In the setup/config is a line that looks like:
folder-collections     = <No Value Set: using mail/[]>

Each person will have to edit it to also include the new folder 
collection that is housed in a mutually accessable area. Be sure to put 
the default in when adding the new one (separated by a comma) or you 
won't be able to get your own mail! Heres what it might look like:

folder-collections     = mail/[], /mutually/accessable/folder/[]

Works for me....

It's quite simple. When composing a message, just press ^R (Rich Hdr) if 
you're in one of the headerfields. Et voila.... There is the Bcc-entry.

Every once in a while i get a user who's mail file in /var/spool/mail
has the remains of an old message at the top of their mail file.
So pine thinks that they have no mail because the top of the file does
not begin with "From ".

Anyone have any suggestions on how this could happen ?
Running pine on aix 3.2.5 and users may use it on the host or through
pcpine.

The only thing that i can think of is that a delete was interrupted by a
broken connection and so the file was not updated properly. No hardware
or other software problems.

is this a bug (known) in pine or my problem?

Hello,
	I've just got the pcpine_w.zip from ftp. When I read the 
install.txt within the ZIP, I noticed that a file called wattcp.cfg 
should include in the ZIP. In fact there is none of the wattcp.cfg.
Do anyone get experience to setup and run PC Pine?
	Besides, I want to know whether PC Pine can open the (plain text) 
folder copied from the Unix Pine.

Hi:

I just realized that we have the editor on our vax system.  Should be no 
surprize since we have pine, right?
Anyway, I was all excited, knowing how easy to use pine is, I figured 
pico would be a great, user-freindly alternative to tpu or emacs.
However, I was reading the help screen and thought wouldn't it be a good 
idea to print this out.  But I could not figure out how to do it.  In 
pine the command is "y" but not pico.  
Any ideas/ help?

Message-Id: <44fcoe$9f7@krone.daimi.aau.dk>

It happens many times that when I close a folder Pine asks if
it should delete # of mails. That happens even if I never mark
any mails Deleted.

It both happens with Windows pine and Unix pine.

The imapd server is a SCO UNIX running mmdf.

What can the reason be for that behavior. Is there anything I can do
to change it ?

It is possible that your server defines a certain period, after which 
messages will be deleted.  For example, at Boston College, messages are 
deleted after 30 days.  
So, if it's always after a particular number of days, this may be the answer.
However, other than that, I am not sure what would cause that.

This is another of Those Questions that have been asked and answered many 
times in recent weeks.  The short answer is your problem is almost 
certainly *not* with Pine, but with the version of the sendmail delivery 
program installed on your computers.  Pine pipes the message you're 
sending to sendmail for delivery.

The problem lies with a security release of sendmail that introduced 
another bug: messages sent to a number of people (more than about 20) 
caused it to crash.  System Managers (of which I am one!) are quick to 
install security fixes, but slow to do "normal" upgrades! ;-)  Contact 
your system manager and ask them to check you are running at least 
version 8.6.12 of sendmail.

Perhaps this would also be a good time to remind people that the Pine 
Information Centre, with documentation, FAQs *and an archive of this 
mailing list/newsgroup* is available on the World-Wide Web:

	<URL:http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/>

The Pine-Info/comp.mail.pine archive has a very useful "Search" function 
too!  :-)

Subject: IMAP with NIS on Solaris
Date: 29 Sep 1995 08:44:40 GMT
Message-Id: <44gblo$6t0@scotsman.ed.ac.uk>

Apologies if this isn't the appropriate place for a question on imapd, but
pine users are my best guess for people who know about imap.  If there's
somewhere more appropriate for me to go, e.g. FAQ, newsgroup, etc. then please
let me know.

I'm new to IMAP, and I've compiled it up on a Sun running Solaris 2.4.  It
works great for users with local password entries, but fails to authorise
connections for users in my YP database.  To check I tried a direct 
connection to the imap and pop ports:

# telnet <host> 143                          
Connected to <host>.
Escape character is '^]'.
* OK <host> IMAP2bis Service 7.8(92) at Fri, 15 Sep 1995 14:46:23 +0100 (BST)
A001 LOGIN <username> <passwd>
A001 NO Bad LOGIN user name and/or password

# telnet <host> 110
Connected to <host>.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK <host> POP3 3.3(18) w/IMAP2 client (Comments to MRC@CAC.Washington.EDU) at Fri, 15 Sep 1995 14:47:04 +0100 (BST)
user <username>
+OK User name accepted, password please
pass <passwd>
-ERR Bad login

I've checked this by transposing the same username from the local passwd file
to YP and vice versa.

It may also be worth saying that I implemented YP in the "Solaris" way, so it
still uses a shadow password file, though not in the standard place, /etc.  

Any suggestions etc. grovellingly received.

Subject: save incoming mail by fcc?
Date: 29 Sep 1995 08:30:09 GMT
Message-Id: <44gaqh$lu1@merlion.singnet.com.sg>

Is there a wayto make pine look-up an fcc in an addressbook
when attempting to save incoming mail (s command).

Although I have set a special fcc (same one for a number of
addresses my brother uses), s)save tries to use a value
from the header. I'd prefer it to use the address to look
up the fcc in my addressbook (so I can keep all correspondence)
w/ my brother in one folder.

I have currently set a workaround using procmail (it saves
everything incoming to one file), but I don't want to
set that up for all recipients (sometimes I only want to save
important mail).

Is there a way? this is pine 3.91

thx
mathias

You need to be more specific, about which folder you close.

I have a setup here, so all mails which have been read in INBOX,
is forced to the folder:  new-mail, you can call it a form of save
which marks the messages as deleted in the first folder,
and therefore, leaving Pine gives the question about delete files
in INBOX

You'd better examine your setup.  My PINE was not setup to have a Bcc:
You need to define you own rich headers, and make Bcc: one of them

You're being too hasty...  At the Main Menu type "S" for Setup and then 
look at the menu at the bottom of the screen.  See?  (Instead of typing 
"C" for "Configuration" you should now type "P" for "Printer.)

  Some people will tell me... I lost all of my mail... I use
  pine... etc. etc.

  The most common reason I found was that they had save the
  read messages to the read-messages folder (I think in same case
  automatically when they exit pine)...

  The second most common was at the end of the month... when they
  loose the old mail-read and mail-sent.

  Perhaps nothing to do with this thread... but, could be useful

    What do you mean by "pound sign"?  Do you mean the British currency 
symbol for "pound sterling" (shaped somewhat like the letter 'L'), or do 
you mean what (at least) Americans refer to as a "pound sign," a hash 
mark or tic-tac-toe sign ('#' on my US keyboard, ASCII 0x23)?

I have a shell account(though I don't get actual
unix prompt) with pine software. I want to all select 
all the mails in the INBOX with a single command/key
so that I can save them together for retrieval. Is it
possible to do it? 

Moreover, I can't even compose mails offline unless
I use script. Even with scripts, I cannot send all
mails at one stroke rather I have to send it one by one.
What is the way out?

I find it very unfriendly. I do not
know why it is used even today.

Thanks in advance,

Regards,

I have not tried out pc-pine for dos.  However, I have installed succesfully
pc-pine for windows.  I have not encountered any problems with 
configuration files.  (This is perhaps because I didn't look closely at the
documentation).  Even when installing pine for unix, the way you get a 
configuration file is by asking pine to generate the generic one and 
changing it.  I don't recall, but I belive that the first time you start 
pine it will create the configuration file for you and prompt you for 
pertinent data as needed.  (It will ask you if you want to make these 
changes permanent.)  I am not sure if this answers your question or not.

wattcp.cfg is only needed for the packet driver version of DOS PC-Pine.

If you transfer Unix mbox folders to the PC, PC-Pine should be able to
read them, but in Read-only mode.  You'll need to have Pine write them out
in MTX format to have full read-write access.

I wrote a small prgram that takes the pine addressbook format and puts
in 6,000 e-mail addresses in a pine mailing list.  Whan I manually put in
3-4 addresses with an editor in the .addressbook file then it works just fine,
however when I put in this large number of addresses in the same format (obviously
with the program) then pine just gets crazy and cannot use the .addressbook.

Usually at first tru it crashes and says that there was a bug.  then you run
pine again and it tries to open the .addressbook, but even after about 4 trials
it opens it up and there is nothing in the addressbook.  Looks like the
little guy overwhelmed.  Is this reasonable or am I doing something wrong?
Are there limitations for pine in terms of addressbook size?

Subject: Help me with news setup
Message-Id: <m6DawrE@quack.kfu.com>
Date: Sat, 30 Sep 1995 04:49:56 UTC

I still have this problem with setting up Pine to read the news.  My
sysadmin told me that the nntp-server to use was 'news.'  I entered this
in the configuration, and Pine automagically changed the news-collection
setting to the default, *{news/nntp}[].  Seems fine, I have all my
newsgroups folders.  However when I try to open any of them to read
articles, I get messages like "No state for newsgroup found, reading as
new" and "Newsgroup is empty."

I read the FAQ, which said the default for the news-collection setting
might be incorrect, and I tried the other options they gave:

News *{news/nntp}[*]            same problem
News *{news}[*}                 told me the selected newsgroup didn't
exist
News *[*]                       couldn't connect to the news server

I've asked my sysadmin about this but haven't gotten a reply in over two
weeks.  I'm sure the server is okay because I can read the news fine
with other newsreaders like tin and rn.  (However I prefer Pine because
of the spiffy editor.)  I can post to newsgroups with Pine, I just can't
read the articles.

If anyone knows how to solve this problem or where else I could look for
a solution (I've already read the FAQ), please help me.

Thanks in advance,
- Alice.

I've never seen that error myself, so can't really help.
Do you have winsock.dll installed?  PC-Pine for windows requires winsock.
Sources include Trumpet winsock (shareware) or numerous commercial tcp/ip
stacks...

	The "spiffy editor" in Pine is pico, isn't it?  Why not set your 
editor to pico for use in tin?  That's what I do.  Works fine.

Subject: Porting PINE 3.91 to Solaris 2.4 (is it *really* done?)
Date: 30 Sep 1995 12:04:12 -0400
Message-Id: <44jpps$mio@ktel.freenet.columbus.oh.us>

Is there some sort of porting issue between Solaris 2.4, the compiler
I'm using, and PINE 3.91?  The C compiler I'm using (Sun's SparcWorks
Pro 3.01 C compiler) is ANSI compliant... PINE seems to be working
with the assumption that the compiler won't be, when dealing with
Solaris (probably unsafe, as Solaris doesn't come bundled with a
compiler -- you need to find GCC or buy a professional product... I've
never seen a professional product that wasn't ANSI compliant, and GCC
certainly is...).

I've been watching this group for a short time, and noticed a fair
number of Solaris issues being noted.  People aren't noting the
particular versions of Solaris in their posts, which could be part of
the problem.

I'm able to build everything except the PINE executable itself,
without too many problems... but in PINE itself, there's all sorts of
issues.  I've got a transcript below, but let me get out my theory...
The code problems are appearing in headers.h (during pre-processing).
It seems that because Solaris 2.4 (sol) is defined to be non-ANSI, the
PINE code is attempting to re-declare functions and, as a result,
there are mismatches.

Now, the simple attempt to fix this (read: make Solaris out to be an
ANSI-based system) fails miserably... the job seems to be a lot more
involved than it should be.  Has anyone out there successfully built
PINE 3.91 under Solaris 2.4?  I can always build it under an earlier
operating system, but would prefer to "do it right the first time" so
to speak.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

	OK....I've said this more than once....but I'll say it again.

	There are normally 3 things that need to be checked/adjusted
before attempting to compile pine under Solaris.  They are:

1.	Make sure that /usr/opt/SUNWspro/bin appears in your path
	*before* /usr/ucb.  i.e. do a "which cc" and if you get 
	/usr/ucb/cc you *will* have problems.

2.	In the pine directory, edit the makefile.sol file and add
	-Dconst= to the CFLAGS line.  This is a *must*.

3.	Make sure you don't have the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	set.  If you do *unset" it.

	Once you've done that *then* do a "build sol".  *IF* you already
have done a "build sol" then made corrections *do* a "build clean" first.

	Do *not* worry about the ANSI messages.  Mark Crispin talked
about this many times in the past and I'm sure he is just about as 
tired of repeating that as one can get repeating what I have.  (Yes,
I should learn and save this message to make my life easier.....but
than I wouldn't have anything to complain about.... :-) ;-) )
