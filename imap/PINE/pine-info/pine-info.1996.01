This should not happen, the fcc in your addressbook should override the 
fcc-name-rule to recipient, unless of course you have more than one name 
at the same address, then it will look for the 1st name with that address.

Correct, except your default is NOT sent-mail it's recipient.

Which it what it should do, since you reset your fcc-name-rule to recipient

You can't have it both ways

Not sure how to explain this any better, but without some other mail
filtering program, PINE can save 'carbon copies' (fcc's) of sent mail to
either the generic sent-mail folder (which can be renamed or redirected), 
or by recipient, or by sender, or by fcc's specified in your addressbook, 
but as you pointed out above, if you reset it as you have to save by 
recipient, and that recipient is not in your addressbook, it's going to 
try to make a (for example jgvd) folder because that's what you told it 
to do.

Your original question of PINE overriding the fcc's set in your
addressbook probably has to do with the fact that you have 2 or more names
with the same address, and PINE will look to fcc to the first ADDRESS not
the first name so if you have 'Grandma van@nico.nl' and 'Grandpa
van@nico.nl' it will look to the first van@nico.nl for an fcc and if
Grandma doesn't have one, Grandpa's mail won't be fcc'd there either.  
Don't ask why, I don't know, I just know how it works.

The next time you type F or f in trn to post a followup, notice that there
is a "Cc:" line at the top.  The purpose of it is to send email at the
same time as you are posting news.

>much responsibility for themselves.

Whenever I ask a question with a specific answer on a technical newsgroup,
I ask for replies via email and explain that I will summarize responses. 
There are several benefits.  First, I can keep signal-to-noise on the
newsgroup to a minimum, by weeding through the responses in my mailbox and
posting a summary of responses (or sometimes just by explaining what
worked). 

Second, the amount of lag time between my posting, the post reaching
someone who knows the answer, and their post reaching me can be days. 
With the lag getting longer and the expiration period on newsgroups
getting shorter every month, being able to halve the amount of time for a
response is welcome. 

Third, there are many people (sometimes called "lurkers") who do not
choose to post but will send email.  If they answer my question, then that
is an answer I would not have received if I asked for all responses to be
sent to the newsgroup.  (Yes, this point isn't so solid because one may
say that such people would just email me anyway, but I'm not so sure
that's true.)

Fourth -- and for me, most important -- is that email waits for *me*.  As
a sysadmin, I can't plan for system failures and other times of duress,
and reading news is rather low on my list of priorities.  When I have to
work a seventy-hour week, I'm lucky to keep myself clean and fed -- I can
forget sleeping, let alone reading news.  If I'm away from news for a few
days, the article answering my question is likely to be gone.  My only
choices are to ask the question of the newsgroup again (which is rather
rude) or to wait until one of the archival services pick up the article
(which in my experience can take weeks). 

If everyone had high-speed lines and tens of gigabytes of storage on their
news spools, then I'd probably use news to solicit email responses much
less frequently; news alone would be quite acceptable.  But for asking
questions for which there is a specific answer ("is there a way to clear
the foobar database on a VZ/9000?") and I am interested in that answer,
and not discussion, I will continue to solicit email. 

I don't think we're disagreeing here; I, too, get irritated when I receive
email that was also posted and the author does not say so in the body of
the message.  But not so irritated as to killfile them in news. 

As for killfiling individuals in mail, that's another argument that I'm
not going to get into here.  I personally believe that killfiling an
individual's email is crass and tactless, the equivalent of totally
ignoring someone you know when you meet in person.  But that's a
disagreement for another day.

	Hello:

	In most DOS/Windows wordprocessors, pressing the 
`Ctrl + Right Arrow' keys would make the cursor jump to the next word. The 
PINE v3.91 Editor we have here doesn't understand this key combination 
(I guess because it is a UNIX application).

	Is there a similar key combination in PINE that would do the same
thing? Thanks for your help.

You postings ARE getting out.  The reason you don't see them immediately 
when you telnet to another site and look for them, probably is because it 
may take several hours OR MORE for the post to travel to the other site's 
server, could even in some cases be a day or more.  Hope that helps.  BYE

You are fortunate to not have encountered some of the people I have sending

Sometimes the news server on my site is slow to respond, so Pine seems to

I can use 'kill' to send a signal to Pine, but I don't want to kill it; I

    I am using Unix Pine 3.91.  In the composer (or in Pico, which is 
pretty much the same thing), Ctrl-@ (^@) moves the cursor from word to 
word toward the right.  On my keyboard I do not have to use Shift, so 
Ctrl-2 works just fine.

I am using PCPINE 391 under window 3.1 running on Novell network. My mail is
in a rs6000 machine which have PINE for unix installed.

When I try to set up the pcpine to get my mail from this server, a alway got
a message saying the connection refused.

I just wonder, since I don't have to type in my unix account password in the
pcpine, it is normal to be refused by the host!!

How should I set up my pcpine to read the mail send to my unix host? 

Thanks very much for your help.

Have you tried answering the question with a 'y'?  If not, you might try
that.  You can also set a feature in Pine called 'quit-without-confirm'
which will avoid that prompt.

You need to set up your PC Pine client to read mail via IMAP.  Define your
INBOX as {mymailserverhostname}INBOX and it'll prompt you for a login name
and password when you connect.  If your AIX machine isn't running imapd,
then it needs to (your mail server must support POP3 for this to work).

I don't use PC Pine, so someone else may be more qualified to help you with
PC specifics.

Date: 2 Jan 1996 13:34:44 GMT
Message-Id: <4cbc9k$do@frankensun.altair.com>
Status: O
X-Status: 

I've been using Pine for months without any problems.  Recently, we
installed a different mail transport agent on our mail server (switching
from standard Berkeley sendmail to smail).  It appears that Pine's default
behavior is 'metoo', meaning that if my name appears in an alias list, I
get a copy of the message (which I don't want).  Since the default behavior
of Berkeley services is to *not* resend mail to the sender unless
explicitly requested, I haven't noticed this feature of Pine until now.
I've looked through all of the options under S)etup C)onfig and found
nothing intuitively relevant.  I've been assured by a person-with-clue that
our smail process should behave the same way that sendmail does, and to
verify that myself, I tried sending mail using UCB mail and defining 'set
nometoo' in my .mailrc file.  The results were as I expected.  With 'set
nometoo', I didn't receive a copy of my message.  I've also tried sending
my mail to a local sendmail process instead of punting it to our smail
server via SMTP.  This did not resolve the problem.

What I'd like to know is: Is there a way to 'set nometoo' (as with UCB
mail) under Pine so that I don't receive copies of messages I send to
aliases that I'm in?

Any help would be geniunely appreciated. :)

In the past couple of weeks, when booting pine, at least twice I've gotten
notices proclaiming that I was being updated to the latest version of
pine, 3.91 I think, a version that was already running on my system. Each
time my personal pine defaults have been zapped and had to be reset, and I
also suspect a list I had created in the address book was also zapped.
Who's doing this unecessary updating and why does it zap my defaults?

You really need to produce the .pine-debug1 file.  Those problems are not
being experienced globally.  I use pine to edit news headers and such all
the time.  I've postponed messages dozens of times without a problem.
Start up pine with 'pine -d 1' to get a debug level 1 file.  Make sure your
pine command isn't aliased (using C shell start it with a leading \, as in
\pine) and make sure you have write permission in the directory you start
it in.

Folks,

My system administrator downloaded and compiled pine for our project
use.  I haven't yet begun to dig in deeply to find out why, but when
PINE lists the folders in the mail/ subdirectory, it chops off the     
first two characters in the folder names.  For example, "sent-mail"
is listed as "nt-mail."  If I try to open this folder, PINE says
"folder 'nt-mail' does not exist."  This phenomenon occurs for every
folder in ~/mail/.  Also, "mail/" is listed as one of the folders.  
This seems strange.  I don't remember this being the case on my last
jobsite where I used PINE. 

Any ideas or help?

Thanks in advance.

Get the original post number (the "references") and be sure to have a
"Control:" header in the list of optional headers, or use the command
in pine to allow you to add it.

Use the following headers:

Control: cancel <D6J5Jz.72A@indirect.com> 
Subject: cmsg cancel <D6J5Jz.72A@indirect.com> 

And have a non-empty text; the signature should be sufficient

The statement I replied to was to the effect that it was no harder to
reply as the poster wished than to reply normally. In this case, the
poster was asking for email copies of followups. I consider having to
locate the proper email address and type it in to be much harder than
just typing "F".

That's nice. That isn't the issue being discussed. If you read the
paragraph you quoted, you might have noticed that it dealt with people
sending mail and posting.

That's nice. For me, email is brought to my attention immediately (if
I am logged in) and requires that I at least look at who it is from to
determine if it is something that requires more attention. Some dork
sending me mail with a copy of his news article is an interruption I 
don't need. I will see his article in news. If I don't, and I have
considered the topic important enough, it will be caught by my news
agent. 

>a sysadmin, I can't plan for system failures and other times of duress,

Mine too. That is why getting copies of articles by mail is a waste of
time. Someone has decided for me that his article should be high on my
priority list. Even if all it says is "me too".

>If I'm away from news for a few

So get an agent to scan news for important things and have it save them
for you. It isn't rocket science. It took me an afternoon to write one.
It isn't perfect, but when I left town for three weeks right at the
beginning of a discussion, I didn't worry a bit about missing anything.
It was waiting for me when I got back.

>and not discussion, I will continue to solicit email. 

Good for you. And there will be people who will ignore your question
because they think your solicitation is rude, or who will post anyway.
You make your choice, they make theirs.

Excuse me? Where did I say I killfile them in news?

Email is not meeting someone in person. If you think it is crass and
tasteless to reject email from crass and tasteless people who refuse to
stop sending copies of news articles, well, that's your opinion and I
am not going to let it bother me.

  I assume that the binary file you wanted to extract is an attachment to
an e-mail, thus in MIME format.
  When you're viewing that e-mail, press V for View. Then use the arrow
keys to select the attachment. Press S for Save (to a file). Enter the
file name you want the binary to be saved as. That's it.

I've installed a pine 3.91 binary compiled for Sco on SCO 3.2v4.2. 
It runs fine from the console or a dial-up PC emulating Wuse60 but 
crashes on ANY of our terminals (mix of tvi925, wyse60, wyse120). 
Here is the last few lines of debug output on each occasion:

When run from the console:

Clearly there is an error with "Select on tty" but what does this 
mean and how do I fix it? I wondered about hand-shaking as our 
terminals use Xon/Xoff. Also we don't have tcp/ip.

Is there any way to control the packet size of an attached binary using 
pine?  The copy in use on netcom does not seem to break up the mime 
encoded binary into digestable sized packets, so attaching a large binary 
means that my email can't get through some gateways and to some services.

Actually, I think what is going on is that your defaults are getting 
zapped first. When you start up pine it looks at the defaults for the 
laster-version-used= line (or something like that) and sees that it is 
blank or not there and gives you the notice about the latest version of 
pine. I would look into things that might be causing your ~/.pinerc to be 
deleted.

You lucky person.  You must be running Solaris.  You need to rebuild Pine,
but first in the Makefile set "cc" to be "ucbcc" (which, in spite of the
name, is the compiler that you use to compile SVR4 compliant programs).

	Hummm???

	I've built pine3.89, 3.90, and 3.91 on Solaris 2.3, 2.4 and
I've never had to "Makefile set "cc" to be "ucbcc".....and I've never
seen the problem of clipping folder names.

	Gee....and not only that, what "Makefile" are you suggesting needs
editing?

It all depends upon how the C compiler was installed on your system.  If you
have the BSD compatibility compiler installed as the default, you will get the
clipping behavior.  This is because the BSD readdir() function returns a
struct in which the file name is offset two bytes from where it would be from
the SVR4 readdir() function.

Pretty much all of them (imap, c-client, pico, pine, imapd) if you want to be
sure that you are avoiding the problem.

This is very bad advice.

It is best to completely avoid ucbcc.  The specific symptom reported is the
result of confounding includes and libs between the standard SVR4
environment and the incompletely and improperly done "bsd src compat" cruft.

A properly configed and compiled Solaris program does not need any of the
crap that ucbcc contaminates things with.

Everyone who compiles things for SunOS 5.x should get a copy of the "Solaris
Porting FAQ" from the FAQ place.

There is no way to set the metoo behavior.  Pine's exec of sendmail
doesn't set the parameter one way or the other, so you're getting the
default set in the mail transport agent configuration.  Apparently the
sendmail default was set opposite of what the smail default is.  If you
know of an SMTP server that has the default the way you want it, you could
set smtp-server to that host and that would probably fix it.  The next
version of pine will have a way to configure the arguments passed to the
program that is invoked, so you'll be able to set the behavior you want
with a command line argument.

How is enriched text turned off in outgoing messages?  I've been using
Pine since 3.89, and I've never seen an option in .pinerc (or in the

never seem to go out with enriched text (which is my preference, since
many people find it irritating), but I frequently see it in other
messages generated by Pine (and usually with Content-Transfer-Encoding:

Perhaps.  Note I did say "individuals."  When you say "people", do you
mean the same?  I have been forced to killfile mail from some of these
advertising groups, especially those that routinely send all mail from an
unreplyable address.  My usual method of dealing with these, to contact
postmaster at their address and postmaster at whichever site InterNIC says
is giving them access, works less and less frequently these days -- I
guess these assholes are getting more and more savvy about how to avoid
proper netiquette (and accountability) entirely. 

But in most cases, email I don't want to receive can be split into two
camps:  harrassing email with no content (I consider unsolicited adverts
to fall into this class), and email with content I don't want to read.  
In the first case, I feel comfortable killfiling the address, provided 
that the address is not one of my users.  A mailbomb is an example that I 
think is beyond question.  But in the second case, I have difficulty just 
shutting the person up.  In my judgment, I don't want to hear what they 
have to say -- now.  But what if that person needs to tell me about a 
security problem involving my site, or tell me some equally legitimate 
item?

In the past month, I've had to deal with two of my users who accidentally
broke a rule on two sites (MUDs, or BBS's or something).  Neither had any
malice at heart, they were just new to the net and computers in general
and didn't know better.  After they broke these rules, the operators -- I
hesitate to call them "administrators" -- of both sites took the same
action and banned our entire site (with over 27,000 users!). 

In one case, the user contacted me, and I contacted the operator and
explained what was going on.  The operator apologized for the 
misunderstanding, explained that the mistake my user made looked like a 
common way some users caused mischief on her site, and opened access back 
to our site.  I warned my user to read all the helpfiles available on an
unfamiliar site before gallavanting around it, and that was the end of 
the story.

The other case wasn't so rosy.  This user didn't come to me, instead he
took matters into his own hands, and started sending very nasty email to
the operator of the site.  The operator killfiled him.  He got one of his
friends -- another undergraduate -- to send the operator email
complaining.  The operator killfiled her, as well.  Even then the user
didn't come to me.  Instead, I had to learn about it through the
complaints of twenty or so of my users for whom this was a favorite site. 

I did some investigating and learned the above story.  As far as I was
concerned, my user had behaved inappropriately and I was not going to go
to bat for him.  However, my other users had done nothing wrong, and to
shut off access to potentially 27,000 people because of the actions of one
seemed a bit rash.  I assumed the operator simply did not know that my
site had so many users.  Perhaps I could convince the operator that
disabling the user instead of the site was a better way to handle this. 

I sent the operator email, and was frustrated to learn that he had
killfiled not just the two people who had sent him harassing email, not
just my entire site, but the entire unc.edu domain!  I had to pass email 
through a third party -- the postmaster of the operator's domain -- just 
to get the killfile released.

(I suppose, given this inauspicious beginning, I should have seen it
coming, but I was surprised when the operator chose not to follow my
suggestion.  He kept reciting, almost like a mantra, "It's my site, I'll
do what I want.  Maybe I made a mistake, but I'm not going to change it
because it's my site, I'll do what I want..."  Even after I informed him
that my user would be disciplined for the harrassing mail, he maintained
his ban on my site.)

So what am I trying to say with these stories?  That only s.o.b.'s
killfile people?  No; rather, my job -- the job of *communication* -- was
made ridiculously difficult because some idiot decided that he was better
than me, better than anyone at my site, and would have nothing to do with
anything any of us had to say. 

As far as I'm concerned, the benefit gained from establishing killfiles
against an individual's email is close to nil.  The costs are much
greater. 

I'm afraid setting up killfiles for mail from individuals -- real people 
-- feels to me like the king granting audience only to the worthy.

Yes, I do mean individuals; I haven't killfiled any advertising groups in
mail simply because I rarely seem to receive mail from the same source
twice.  The situation that I encounter is that I killfile someone in news
who is being abusive, blatently off-topic, or otherwise is not producing
anything I am interested in reading, and said person (apparently figuring
out that they are in my killfile in news) starts responding to various
postings I make (not in response to him) in e-mail.  The e-mail has the
same complete lack of content and abusive language as the posts, so I
killfile him in e-mail as well.

In this case, I do not consider complaining to the person's postmaster to
be appropriate.  I firmly believe that if I post to Usenet, anyone is
entitled to send me an e-mail response to my post.  There is simply no
guarantee that I'm going to read that e-mail.  People also can be abusive
if they wish; I just don't have to listen to it.

> But in most cases, email I don't want to receive can be split into two

I wouldn't killfile e-mail just because I don't like what the person is
saying.  In that case, the e-mail is almost always a response to a post of
mine, and I'll respond with a short message saying that I have no desire
to discuss the issue via private e-mail, and that I would prefer that they
post.  I may ignore further e-mail on the same subject, but I wouldn't
killfile them for that.

I have been known to killfile in mail people who insist on sending me
copies of any followup they make to my posts without marking the e-mail
copy as a copy.  (Insist meaning that they do it repeatedly with full
knowledge of my preferences.)  I consider that harassment without
meaningful content (since the content is redundant).

Note that I said "without marking the e-mail copy as a copy."  I prefer
not to receive e-mailed copies at all, but if it's marked as a copy, it's
only a minor annoyance.

> But what if that person needs to tell me about a security problem
> involving my site, or tell me some equally legitimate item?

I should point out that my incoming mail is split according to which
address the mail was sent to, and administrative mail or any mail sent to
a work address is not subjected to any form of score file.  That means
that even people I am ignoring entirely will still be able to reach me if
it is a work-related matter, unless they incorrectly send me work mail to
my personal e-mail address (this one).

Yes, I agree there, which is why I always maintain a separate address that
isn't subjected to any form of killfiles so that people with these kinds
of issues can reach me.  I don't advertise it in my .sig, since I would
prefer not to receive responses to newsgroup posts at that address, but it
is publically available from various obvious locations, so I have no doubt
that someone such as yourself would be able to find it with little
trouble.

Um, i don't think pine can filter mail by itself. If i'm wrong, someone 
please correct me, but show us how to do it! :)

I believe the external program on unix is called procmail. i've never 
used it though...soooo...check out the mail filtering FAQ. it has pretty 
complete instructions on procmail, and some other external programs...

If you mean "is there a way that I can persuade Pine to send characters 
from my keyboard as I type them to someone else's screen and vice versa" 
then the answer is "No".

Pine is a message handling program for reading and sending electronic 
mail messages and Usenet News articles.

For immediate two-way interactive "talking" you want to look at the 
"talk" or "ytalk" programs, or (possibly) an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) 
program.

Hi folks,

I'd just like to say thanks to everyone who replied to my plea for help with 
installing VMS Pine - the advice was greatly appreciated!  Actually though, there is 
just one leetle problem I still have...  Well actually it's a rather big one really, 
I've set the folder-collections variable to: [MYDIR.MAIL][] which is accepted at 
startup, but whenever pine tries to r/w to any folder except INBOX it bombs out with 
'Pine internal error' <gasp>.  I've tried variations on this, but no luck.  And if 
the variable is left undefined, I get: 

Folder "sent-mail" in <SYS[]> doesn't exist.  Create?

And naturally it can't create it if I say yes.

If anyone could give me a hand with this one I'd be really grateful!

Thanks,

Philip Plant,

Computer Officer
Silsoe College.

Let me do an aclaration on this subject.
In order to simplify the administration, I have configure "sendmail" to
hide the hostname in the mail address, so that an address of the form
"name@host.domain" becomes "name@domain".
But, the hostname still appears in the last part of the Message-ID header.
I didn't find any way configuring sendmail or pine, to change it, to a form
coherent with the mail address. 
(Sorry, but I'm not trying to forge the headers nor obscure the origin of 
a message).

I will appreciate very much if someone could give me some help on this.

I have heard in the past that under some circumstances pine will reveal
something about bcc's, but I have never been able to catch it.  Could you
please document this more fully so I can warn my users about the problem.

	If memory serves me correctly I don't think it is a pine issue
but is sendmailism.  If you construct an email message with only a bcc
the receipients will get a message with an "Apparently-To:" header that
"reveals" all the receipients.  Not all versions of sendmail cause this
behaviour....if memory serves me correctly.

Are you running an IMAP daemon on the "linux-mailserver"?  If you
are not, imapd source code can be found with the rest of the Pine 
distribution from  ftp.cac.washington.edu.  It compiles and works
under Linux without complaint.

X-Status: 

I'm using procmail to sort my mail with pine, and it's working fine.  
However, as the procmail FAQ warns, I invalidate my INBOX if I delete a 
message from it while procmail is delivering a new piece of mail.  The 
FAQ advises implementing a file locking scheme, but then doesn't explain 
how.

Has anyone done this sucessfully?  My system is using NFS on IRIX 5.3, so 
I'm not sure if flock() works successfully in this environment.

Any help appreciated..

I am attempting to run Pine 3.91 on an AT&T Unix 3.2.2 system.  I have 
been successful in utilizing SCO binaries for many other applications and 
O/S utilities on this system.  However, the SCO binary of Pine does not 
seem to be so cooperative.  I have tried getting information to locate a 
binary specifically for this platform, but have gotten no responses :( 
... I must assume no such binary exists.  I have no development 
capabilities on this platform either (no compiler).

So ... here is the problem specifically.  I run the Pine binary and get 
to a main menu.  The Inbox begins to open and I get a beep.  The Pine 
session then ends with an error:

Pine Panic: Select error: Invalid arguement

It tries to write out to //.pine-crash .. but fails to do so.  The 
.pinerc file never gets created either .... although it will read it if I 
create one for it. There are some other pinerc files that are created, 
but appear to be more like temporary files .... pinerca006610 and 
pinerc006610 are two examples.  I have tried to set the "set uid" and 
"set gid" bits to correct the error of being unable to write to //.pinerc 
.. no luck.

I can substitute various AT&T binaries for their SCO equivelant .. if I 
knew where to start .. the entire mmdf and mailx systems are already the 
SCO binaries!  Regular mail works well BTW.

Here is the pine debug file from level 9 debugging ... if it helps to 
point me in the right direction. TIA!

Uh, excuse me.

ucbcc *is* the standard SVR4 compiler.  In spite of the name, it has
nothing to do with BSD source compatibility.  The name is a link to
something like /opt/SUNWspro/SC3.0.1/bin/acc

Depending upon how the system was installed, "cc" runs either ucbcc or the
BSD source compatibility compiler, which often is a script such as cc5
that specifies all the BSD libraries.

Pine *is* "properly configured" for SVR4 on Solaris.  The problem is
getting it to compile right.  And the only way to do that is to avoid
using "cc", which has unpredictable results, and invoke the compiler by a
name that is not going to include the BSD libraries.

You're right, it's a sendmail-ism.  If you construct a message that isn't
actually *to* anybody (with no To: line), some versions of sendmail will
tack on the 'Apparently To:' bit from your bcc:.  Of course, I question the
sanity of anyone sending out totally blind messages with no To: (at least a
group name or some such would seem in order). :-)

It's referring to other programs, run independently of pine.  Procmail is
one, filter is another.  On most UNIX systems, you can create a .forward
file on your mail server and set it up to forward your mail to a program
which divides your mail into separate boxes (or takes a variety of other
definable actions) depending on various criteria in your incoming mail.
For more information, run a gopher or archie search on 'procmail' and
you'll surely find what you want.

Uh, no.  You're wrong.  ucbcc is a link to acc in the SparcWorks
distribution.  cc is a completely separate (and *MUCH* smaller) binary.
>From the acc man page:

     acc (SPARC only) is not intended  to  be  used  directly  on
                         ^^^
     Solaris  2.x.  The  sole  purpose for making it available on
     Solaris 2.x is to enable /usr/ucb/cc.  The package  SUNWscpu
     must  be installed to use this.  The options for /usr/ucb/cc
     are the same as for acc and are described here.

The cc in /usr/ucb is also wrong, because it adds /usr/ucblib to the
LD_RUN_PATH.  This contains BSD libraries.  The only correct way to run the
SparcWorks compiler is to have the particular path it was installed in in
your path.  From the 'real' cc man page:

     The cc(1) manual page describes the ANSI C compiler  options
     that are SVID compliant under Solaris 2.x. cc uses getopt to
     parse command line options. Options are treated as a  single
     letter  or  as a single letter followed by an argument.  See
     getopt(3c).

However, Pine *is* properly configured for Solaris.  The original poster's
administrator, on the other hand, is not. :-)

	Indeed he does talk POP3 directly to the POP3 server. Enter
	"{your.pop.server/pop3}INBOX" in SETUP -> CONFIG -> inbox-path

	Works fine for me in PINE 3.91 under Linux.

	B T W: Is there no later version than 3.91?

We use Pine on all SCO versions exept Xenix (until now) with success.

If you have difficulty's with terminals, checkout the terminfo-file 
first, look for the correct value of cursorkeys to be filled in.
In case the cursorkeys are not working, you can allways use F(orward), 
B(ackward), P(revious), N(ext) and so on.

On a system _without_ TCP/IP we use a (dirty) trick: make a link from 
/dev/null to /dev/socksys :-) we use Pine there as MUA only.

You may have overlooked it in the morass of WWW writeup that I
pointed you to at http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html,
but there are several configuration fields that you have to get
just exactly right - this VMS port of PINE does not support other
values.  Your symptom looks to me like you still have the default
Fcc: configured.  This does not work and you must turn it off.
The work-around is to add a "customized header" of BCC: to your
own email address, assuming that you want to keep a copy of your
sent mail.

I'd suggest go over my writeup again and get the settings to the
ones that I list there.  Hope that helps.

I'm running into a situation where I THINK a particular MUA -- let's call
it "pine 3.91" -- emits "cc:" headers that don't get processed by the
metoo functionality of an MTA which shall be known as "smail 3.1.29".  Is
"cc:" any more or less valid than "Cc:" or "CC:" or something which
starts with a capital letter?  My reading of RFC 822 says that "cc:" is
quite valid -- is it possibly deprecated in some later RFC?

Recently I changed providers and wanted to use my

However, the new provider's Pine (same version as at
old site) would not accept the old .addressbook from
the old provider.  Addresses were not properly placed
in the correct columnar format.  I transferred .address-
book to/from my PC with sz/rz.  Is it possible that
some control characters were affected?  Any suggestions?

When I am "talking" to someone on the system, the backspace does not work 
properly.  Instead of backspacing like it normally does when I use Pine, 
it gives me some garbage like ^[O    .  I am using Mac Kermit 0.991 on a 
Quadra 610, but it does the same thing on my 386 at home using Windows 
for Workgroup's Terminal program.  Other computers I have used on campus 
actually backspace when you are "talking" and type the Backspace key, so 
I know it is possible.  I am thinking it has something to do with key 
assignment.

BinHex 4.0 is a macintosh program. It is very old, and its function is 
duplicated in most expander utilities. You should either find a mac and 
use a program like Stuffit or Stuffit Expander to decond/uncompress the 
file and then write it onto a DOS disk, or try to find a version of 
Stuffit for the PC, which I think is now available. A binhexed file has 
".hqx" tacked onto the end of the name. Perhaps you have already dealt 
with such files?

Hi,

	I'm not a MACer....and I'm sure this has been answered before but
I did not commit the answer to memory.

	A friend in Singapore is having trouble with pine on an HP machine
to which he is connecting via NCSA's Telnet.

	He states:

I have a few problems with the HP system. the most annoying is
that fact that <CTRL> C does not cancel a message in pine or
end a man session, but hangs my telnet window. The message I
get is process interupted.

	So, the answer is????

	Thanks,

		Ed

	Hi,

	When I use PINE to send mail, my address is being defined as 
"fribeiro@obelix.obelix.unicamp.br" when the correct form would be 
"fribeiro@obelix.unicamp.br".

	How can I correct this ? Certainly, it is one of the options of 
the configuration module, isn't it ? But, there are so many ... :-) and
no one so intuitive ... How can I set the correct form for all the users ?

	Thanks in advance.

			Fernando

P.S : the problem doesn't happen when I use "ELM" or "mail -v" .

I put below one .pine-debug1 example. I hope that it helps you :

I think you can salvage what you have with some editing.  When I look at
my address book the fields are delimited by tabs between each.  I would
assume your transfer changed these in some way.  A fair guess would be
that your tabs were changed to white space.  If you have an editor
that will reveal hiden codes look and see how each field is delimited
now.  With this information you can decide what you need to do.

Hi!  Iwas wondering if there was somewhere I could pick up a manual entry 
for pine.  I don't use pine, but friends of mine do, and since this is 
their first foray into unix, I thought I'd send them something to read 
about pine.  i found a ftp site: pine.cac.washington.edu, but I can't 
seem to "get" anything; permission denied.

Is there any sort of general overview on it, (literally how to use it, 
making aliases, customizing it, etc.  We're not talking sysadmin stuff, 
or installation, just info on using it and learning how to work with it.

I'd welcome any posts on the subject, but since I don't get the  chance 
to check newsgroups, perhaps those posts could be directly mailed to me 
at lslawe@mail.sas.upenn.edu.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

NCSA Telnet already assigns functions to the ^C,^S and ^Z 
keys.  Fortunately you can change that yourself.  Go up to the Session 
menu and choose "setup keys"  Erase what's in them, or choose others.  
Now ^C should work, as it now gets to use the function that unix assigns 
to it.

Hope this works.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

After much fiddling around I got pine 3.91 to compile on my Sparc 20 running
solaris 2.4.  However, pine with display the headers from received messages,
but not show the message text.  Also if I try to send mail pine dumps core.

The code seems to call ioctl with flags no longer support in 2.4.  I've traced
the one of the problems to the outbound filter on the message text.  It
references &c and dies immediatly.

Thanks for you help!

Is there a workaround for this:

When my sent-mail folder is displayed, I've noticed that some entries
show the "To: " line's contents, and some show the "From: " line's
contents.  The difference between these message (with 100% correlation)
is the very first line, the one labeled "From ".  If the hostname in
"From " matches the current hostname, then the contents of the "To: "
line are shown.  But, if the hostname in "From " is a different,
then the contents of the "From: " line are displayed.  Additionally,
it does NOT say that it's using "From: ", it just shows my name.

I'm using an access provider that has two or three different systems
that I can log into, all sharing my home directory.  When I dial in, I
get whichever machine is the least busy at the moment.  So, when I send
mail, the "From: " & "From " lines will indicate whatever machine I was
on at the time.

I have a similar configuration at work.  But, I use the same
workstation MOST of the time, so I rarely see this problem there.

I cannot use the MIME part of PINE when I am forwarding messages to my UNIX
system from my VAX account.

This might sound like a strange thing to need to do, but by system here
includes an interesting fire-wall which posts all incoming mail to my VAX
account, where I can instruct the VAX mail server to forward my mail to 
any internal system, being my UNIX account running PINE.

Therefore all incoming mail has an internal VAX added forwading header instead
of the origional Internet header.  This I belive is the reason that the Pine
I am using does not touch MIME encrypted data!  This is becoming difficult as
I have several friends, all of whome want to send me binary data, and although
I can send them MIME data all day long, can never see what they send back to
me.

I have here the chance to dump my Unix account and use Microsoft Mail, which
under unusual conditions of only getting VAX forwarded mail, does still see
the MIME data and extract it.  This is something I don't even want to consider!

If anybody out there can help me, I will be very happy!  

Please reply to my EMail address using only VAX understandable data.

Ben Clewett.

X-Status: 


I'm finding that if I use ctrl/J to tidy up my untidy input, it's
inclined to trigger PINE into quoted-printable mode: I assume that
this is happening because I've exceeded the max line length that
PINE permits in a non-encoded plain mail.

When the result is intended as a usenet posting, this gets
complaints from other usenauts about the =20 and =3D and stuff.
Many usenet readers don't support MIME and display the stuff raw
to the readers.

Can I do anything, in terms of 1/ reducing the max line length
produced by ctrl/J, or 2/ discouraging PINE from going into
quoted-printable mode in this situation, or 3/ at least giving
some kind of indication that I have provoked it (as could also
happen, for example, if I typed a pound-sterling character in).

Preferably via a configuration parameter (but I looked and
didn't see one) rather than having to rebuild the software.

best regards

I hope someone has encountered my current problem before and can give me
some insight and help. I installed PINE 3.91 on our Sun OS 5.4 a week
before Christmas. Since that time one of our Managers - Al is not
receiving some of his mail in PINE. In desparation we viewed his INBOX in
vi and found a <TAB> on a line by itself at the end of a message that he had 
looked at and then some email that had been hidden. When we deleted the 
<TAB> line and then went into PINE - 17 New messages appeared. 
Does anyone have any idea where the <TAB> is being generated from?

Thanks,
Carolynn

Hi!  It is now Three weeks after upgrading from PINE 3.89 to version 3.91
and our total system has frozen solid with little/no warning . Our
University was closed over the holiday period so there was not a heavy
load on the system up to Tuesday this week. Since then we've averaged 370
users and the system has frozen late each afternoon forcing us to reboot. 
We couldn't even get an interrupt at the system console. I have been
monitoring the system and watching for any dangling pine processes that
may be eating CPU but as the load is low, this doesn't seem to be the 
cause of our hung system. Does anyone have any ideas or insights ? I 
appreciate your views. 
Thanks.

This question has been brought up earlier, but the answer didn't quite 
solve the problem I was having. I use Pine with Procmail to pre-process 
my mail. Everything seems to be working fine, but I was concerned by all 
the warnings in the Pine FAQ and procmail packages about implementing 
some kind of folder locking scheme to make sure the folders are not 
corrupted and mail is not lost.

I read the "Folder-Lock" section in the Pine FAQ and also the documents 
with procmail. There's a lot of information there - too much, in fact. I 
haven't been able to figure out what kind of folder-lock is required, and 
how to implement it.

Could someone who's using Pine with Procmail please tell me (in simple 
terms) what kind of folder-lock scheme they're using, how they set it up, 
and whether they've had any problems using it.

Thanks.

    I sounds as if you just want to forward the message with the 'f' 
command.  A header will come up for you to fill in the email address.

How would you guarantee unique message id's if you allow each host to

I asked that, too, the answer was, that quoted printable is
an internet standard. The authors wonder about the fact, that
so many people want to have a switch to turn it off.
I think they'd prefer, that other mail packages should start
to support the MIME capabilities and quoted printable as well.

If I remember right they think about it, to include such a switch
into the next pine release.

Another thing I'd like to see is, to have a configuration
parameter, that allows you to encode binaries with uuencode.

When I send binary data from home to my sun, I have problems
to get it unpacked. I'd have to compile pine or another package,
to get it decoded. I hope pine will get such feature, too.

This sounds like an important clue.  If Unix utilities get stuck too, it
suggests that the hanging is happening in the system.

My guess is that fsync() causes some kind of directory lockup.  Pine does
an fsync() on the mail file at certain critical points to ensure that the
disk copy is consistant.  One of those critical points is "all requested
flag updates complete".

Since you are running AIX 4, I suggest nagging IBM to fix their operating
system.  Since we're starting to deploy AIX 4 on our RS/6000s, I suspect
that we'll start encountering this problem too.  It does't happen in AIX
3.

Hi!

i am using Pine with procmail for some time and have no troubles (as yet :-)
I haven't done any special configuration. Basically, get and compile 
procmail - I have done it off the shelf without ANY changes; get and 
compile Pine - see above. Then set up .procmailrc to your taste.
I am using curently Procmail 3.11pre4 and Pine for Windows 3.91 with 
IMAP server from Pine 3.91 also. With procmail 3.10 no problem also.

The only point is, don't forget to indicate folder locking in 
.procmailrc, that is, put second colon after the recipe flags, e.g.

:0:
* ...

It makes procmail to lock folder while delivering.

As far as I understand, both procmail and Pine use dot-locking. They 
create temporary file with .lock suffix while holding folder open.

hope it helps

greetings

I don't think it would be sendmail at our site, because we use MMDF.  
Anyways, the regular mail command works fine.  So does SCOMail.  It is

It is, but it's not mandatory even for email yet, and certainly
support for it is not widespread on usenet.  I don't believe it
is polite to use MIME encoding on usenet.  PINE is a nice email 
client but I'm not exactly impressed by it as a usenet client; 
it's just that I'm sometimes in a position where it's the only 
usenet client that's easily accessible to me as a user - I just
wish that it was better behaved on usenet in this (and some other) 
respects.

Could I just say again that I'd be content if I had a way to
cut down the line length somewhat that ctrl/J produces.  Is this
a PICO issue?  I guess it is.  Does PICO have any handles on this,
like a configuration file (rather than needing to rebuild from
source)?

You can consider installing Yehavi Bourvine's port of PINE to
VAX/VMS onto the VAX account.  This understands the MIME headers
in spite of the extra VAX headers.

You should be able to do this even as a normal user, without system
privileges on the VAX system.

look at my notes
http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html
for pointers to the software, etc.  Hope this helps.

You would have to invoke PINE manually on the VAX system.  The
automatic forwarding could not do this AFAIK.

I know this well!  However, an alternative would be to install one
of the MIME utilities such as Mpack on your unix system, and filter
the incoming mail items by hand, if you can't or won't use Yehavi's
package.

Thanks to your long lines, I suspect that this posting is going
to get MIME-encoded by PINE anyway.  (See my other thread on this topic)

Good morning. Does anyone know how I can save my e-mail on a floppy disk?
I use pine.

Thank you for your message. It is very easy to build Pine, Pico and Imap
on SCO Unix: after unpacking the distribution, you only have to give
"build sco" to make all of them. The binaries will be build in the
directory "bin" under the distribution and can be installed by a simple
copy or "make install". 

If you have no TCP/IP and like to use Pine only as MUA (Mail User Agent) 
over UUCP, then do "ln -s /dev/null /dev/socksys" to fool Pine :-)

Of course UUCP and MMDF must be configured, if you need help, as for it.

It definitely does compile.  Run ldd on your binary and post the output.

I seem to have a similar problem - pine insists on BASE64 encoding _any_
attached files, which folks non-mime mailers really have trouble with.
Even files that are just plain US-ASCII.
Is this a bug in 3.90 fixed later?

Any suggestions besides waiting a few more years for mime to spread and
mature some more?

I feel urged to respond to this thread. Bob Dole, one of those breach of 
contractors under that nuetered person. Has had this profanity problem 
with the net. It is my conclusion that if the net would have done away 
with anonymity from the get go we wouldn't have the image problems that 
the net has today. Sure Mr. Mercur used profanity but he put his real 
name to it. As others would have to if they couldn't be anonymous. I
feel the net would be a better place if people couldn't hide. 
Have you read the alt.politics pub. Its depressing as hell to think 
that people can be that neanderthal. But its like that all over. 
On a technical note. Why in thunder can't that curser catch up with 
my typing? I know I have a 2400 baud modem, but sheesh.

You can also try ftp.celestial.com for a SCO ready binary (if you don't 
have the c-compiler to do a build).

Hi

I'm curious. I was in my mail reader, reading the newsgroups to which I
subscribe. I tried posting, but an error message came up: "error-- no
space left on device writing article". The message did not post.

What does that mean? How can I fix the problem?

I can post with my USENET reader, except it's just a little bit more of a
pain to go to USENET. 


Please e-mail me.

Thank you very kindly.

Is it possible (and if so how) to have PINE generate a random .signature?

IE, everytime I compose a message, it pulls out a random quote (or other 
bit of text) from a list.

Thanks.

Is there any way to add an Approved: line to the header when using pine
to run a moderated newsgroup? Is there any way to get it to default with
such a line?

Hello,

The same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago.  I assumed it was 
just a problem with the local "whatever" is handling mail, and I think I 
must have been right as it was fine again when I tried half an hour later.

If anyone really knows, please post to the group.  TIA  Connie

Daniel, one way to do what you wish is to type "e" after you have read 
the message you wish to save.  This option allows the message to be 
exported to a plain textfile on your system.  You must give it a 
filename.  After you have exited pine, download the file to your disk, 
and then delete it from the system on which you saved it before 
downloading it.  (Check before deleting to make sure the message has been 
saved to your disk.)

I have 2 Print Questions about Pine.

When I print, the program freezes after a short period of printing.  At 
this point I have to reboot and log back in. I think it has something to 
do with memory (I am thinking printer memory).  Any ideas on how to correct
this problem?

Also I would like to print without any headers.  When someone sends me a 
document, it sure would be nice just to print it from there as a finished
document rather to have to retype it, or download it to a word processor.

Ideas?

Thanks
Rich

Or if you are using PC Pine for Windows just save (S) or export (E)
to c:\dirname\filename.txt

Can anyone advise me on the best Mail Server for Windows NT? 

There are quite a few mail servers available, including:

EMWAC, IMail, LISTSERV, Mi'Mail, NTMAIL, post.office, sendmail, 
SLmailNT, and StarTech Internet Components--and probably others.

We have a 10-user LAN (Netware 3.11) with an Internet Server (Windows NT 
3.51, Pentium box) running Website, and I want to set up Internet mail. 
My service provider does not provide this facility. Our workstations are 
all running Win95.

Any comments regarding the pros and cons of particular mail servers 
would be welcome.

Ctrl-SPACE or Ctrl-@ will do it.

Our users who read newsgroups with Pine report a similar problem,
especially when they try to go to their folder lists.  If communication
with our news server (which is remote) hits a snag, Pine sits there
forever with a "Building folder list" message.  The only way out is 
Ctrl-C, or wait for the news server to come back to life.
 
Can we have a more elegant solution in 3.92?

I have a patch for Pine 3.91 that fixes this problem. It uses the Mime
8bit encoding when possible, which means no encoding and no mess!

You will need to download and recompile the Pine source to install it. 
The patched version is still in accordance with RFC1340, RFC1428 and 
RFC1521.

Please contact me by email if you are interested.

In Norwegian we have the exact same problem, since we have three extra
characters from the ISO-8859-1 character set. I found Pine such a
good program I simply thought it was too bad to have it spoiled by
the Mine Unreadables.

I find the current situation where programs like Pine and Netscape
switches to Mime Printables whenever they see one little 8-bit
character very unfortunate. RFC1340 clearly indicates the possibility
of sending straight 8bit. As long as this is announced in the
header, I really think that this is a good thing:

     Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=iso-8859-1
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8BIT

> I don't believe it
> is polite to use MIME encoding on usenet.

If you by MIME encoding mean "Quoted Printable", I 100% agree.
I even think its use for email should be limited too.

That is why I have made a patch for Pine 3.91 to allow proper
8bit postings. A feature switch "allow-8bit-mime" has been 
introduced to enable this feature. The 8bit coding for text is
used for situations where all these conditions are met:

	1. The "allow-8bit-mime" feature is set.
	2. One or more character has the upper bit set.
	3. None of these characters are unprintable.
	4. Less than 30% of the characters require 8bit.
	5. The line length is below 500.
	6. There are no NULs.

Please email me at egilk@sn.no if you are interested.

when in fact the user that I just sent the mail to should be getting that

Does pine remove and then recreate the system mailbox from the copy it
uses (and modifies) while you are reading mail, appending any new mail
which may have come in?  If so this may explain it, since then bash
sees a completely new file, and could be excused for thinking that it
was all new mail.


Suggestions?

I am new under Linux and want to use pine to send and receive
messages. But so far I am only able to send them.

I am not connected to any LAN. I use TCP/IP with my modem and
am connected to my internet provider via SLIP. How can I get
the mails which arrived at my provider to my local machine?

Perhaps somebody of you is able to help me.

Thank you.      Frank

I know that 3.92 is probably close to being "set in stone". I wonder if 
these items have been fixed or enhanced.

1. 'pine' takes messages forwarded from Sun's 'mailtool' and splits it up
into 2 messages. (Is this a pine problem or a mailtool problem)?

2. When responding to a mail message, if you do a ^J to justify your 
message, it justifies the included text in the original message. 'To 
Spell', ^T, seems to be smart enough not to check spelling on the 
included text; why can't 'justify' be just as smart ?

3. When selecting news-groups using a pattern (^X) only one group can be 
selected for subscription. Since ^X doest take some time, it would be 
nice to be able to select multiple groups that matched the pattern for 
subscription.

Thanx

It depends. But assuming the standard ISP situation, you'll probably
have to use the POP-3 protocol to retrieve mail. This is accomplished by
the popclient program, e.g:

    popclient -3 -v mail.my_isp.de -u my_username -p my_password \
	      -o /usr/spool/mail/my_localname

I am currently running an evaluation copy of post.office and it out performs all the 
others. It's easy to setup and administer and I would recommend it highly for a small to 
medium size lan.

Subject: Pine for the Macintosh?

Hi:

We have both Unix machines and Macs in our lab, and I have just recently
installed pine on our Unix machines, and so far I like it.  I find the IMAP
feature intriguing.  It would be nice if people who have Macs in their 
offices could remotely access their mail folders on the Unix machines, but
I have so far not been able to find a version of Pine for the Macintosh.  Does
such a thing exist, and if so where can I get it?  If not, is there one in
the works?

This is probably a frequently asked question, but I am new to this group.

Thanks.

How do I send a message to everyone on my mailing list without having a 
huge To: field listing everyone on the list? First off it's annoying to 
receive such a message because you have to scroll down so far to get to it,
and secondly I'd rather not have everyone on the list know who else is on 
the list.

Perhaps you could be so kind to let us know where to find it? Any URL
to it?

Subject: Pine (imapd?) hangs changing message status
Date: 4 Jan 1996 07:51:11 GMT
Message-Id: <4cg0tf$tt8@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Recently I've been seeing Pine sometimes hang when I go into a folder
(most often when it's my sent-mail folder), read a few messages and go 
back to my INBOX folder.  All my mail is being accessed via IMAP.

The imapd is the UW imapd included in the distribution of Pine 3.92.  The
client is Pine 3.92.  Both are running on RS/6000 AIX 4 boxes. 

The hang lasts from three to ten minutes.  While the hang is going on,
memstat, iostat, vmstat, monitor, and even netstat all look good on both
machines.  The imapd process (actually rimapd, but I doubt that matters)
does not appear to use any CPU (at least, from a ps listing) for the
duration of the hang.  Usually the hang is with both asterisks visible in
the upper-left corner of the Pine screen, sometimes with neither.  I have
not seen it hang with but a single asterisk. 

The hang only occurs when I have changed the status of a message.  I have
also seen this hang occur immediately upon viewing a message in my
sent-mail folder (which removes the "new" flag).  Usually, however, it 
does not occur until I attempt to close sent-mail and go back to my INBOX.

If I cd to my ~/mail directory on the IMAP server machine and attempt to
do anything to read the files in that directory (ls, cat, vi, whatever)
the command hangs until Pine finishes hanging.  The moment Pine finishes
hanging, the ls, cat, tail, or whatever abrubtly resumes. 

Has anyone seen this behavior before?  Do you know what to do about it?

It's evening right now :-)


What O.S. are you using?

If you're using Linux, then mount the floppy drive:
	mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy -t msdos
	
then goto your mail-dir:
	cd ~/mail

and copy the file saved-messages to /mnt/floppy


You have to save the messages in pine!!!

Dave,
See http://www.washington.edu/imap
or

for a list of IMAP software we know about, including Mac clients.

We have a feasibility study underway for a Mac Pine, but it's too soon to

	Well, it can't be done with elm alone.  You need to configure
"filter" from the elm distribution.  You can continue to use "filter"
from the elm distribution to filter your mail.  The only thing that
you have to be concerned with is that elm/filter stores incoming mail
in a $HOME/Mail directory as the default while pine use $HOME/mail.

	Another alternative would be to use procmail.

	Someone had recently posted the location of the filter-FAQ...if
you using the newsgroups to access this you can check the archives.

The chances are very high that this error message actually originates 
from the Usenet News server you are using, and Pine is merely reporting 
to you the error message the news server reported to it.

This type of message occurs when the news server's disk where articles 
are stored becomes full.  When this happens you can still read news from 
the server, but it will not accept new articles being posted to it (and 
new articles from other linked servers will also be suspended).

When some disk space is released, typically by the overnight clean-up job 
or the News Administrator person leaping into action, the server will 
again start accepting articles from people.

Yes, it is possible ... but not automatcially.  You need to:

1.  UUencode your file.
2.  Run Pine and start composing your message.
3.  Place your cursor in the message body then read in the UUencoded file
    (by typing ^R followed by the filename).

Files included into the message body in this way are not automatically 
encoded using Base64 or Quoted Printable (unless they have even one 
"funny" character or exceedingly long lines).  Files included by naming 
in the "Attachment" field are *always* encoded using Base64.

It isn't possible in Pine 3.91 (unless you dive in and modify your local 
copy of the source code and recompile!).

However I *think* I heard a rumour that this may be in Pine 3.92 (don't 
hold me to this as I may be wrong).

Personally I would prefer to see automatic use of local/remote signature
files instead of the frill of random ones ... but then I may be old 
fashioned in thinking that the _content_ of a message is more important 
than the signature.  :-)

Well, what do you expect when you send the mail "to anybody *in* Pine"?
Maybe sending mail *out* helps.  ;-)

Yes, new mail is appended to your mailbox (file).
That's why it is called a mailbox, see?

>If so this may explain it, since then bash sees a completely new file,
>and could be excused for thinking that it was all new mail.

No, your shell does not see a new file, but it notices that time stamp
(and the size) of your mailbox (as given by $MAIL) has changed.

You can use ELM's "filter" to filter your mail as mail readers are
independent of the filter you use.  For more info please read this page:

>I don't understand this.

Let me present you a model od terminals which hopefully explains this:

A terminal is a "window" which can only show characters in a grid
given by columns and lines.
The window used on your machine as displayed by your terminal program (T)
must "match" the window as given by the host you connect to (H).
If the number of lines and columns do not match then you will see garbish.

Example:  Assume that T uses lines=25 and columns=80, but H has been set to
lines=24 and columns=80.  When T receives another line to print in lines 25
it will overwrite line 25.  On H however there is no line 25, so it will
move to line 1 and overwrite that one.

There are lots more problems as terminals use different codes like "jump to
position" and "clear line" etc.

Therefore you must make sure that ther terminals "match".
To see which terminal is used on a UNIX machine use the command "stty"
(set teletype).

Welcome to the world of great ideas and incompatibilities!  :-)

....you're looking at a known bug in the terminal emulation in Zterm .9.  
In your terminal setup, there is a dialog box which lets you set the

recall that it defaults to 25 lines and you must reset it to 24.

....better yet, get a newer Zterm.  .9 went away more than a year ago!

Hi:
David L. Miller of pine suggested I write you an email.  I am having the 
'darndest' time trying to get pine to run on our Unixware 2.01 box.  I 
was hoping you could rescue me!  I've tried downloading from your Pine 
Server, I've bought a CD Rom with Pine on in (Internet Tools), copied 
pine from another System V server...and none of them work.  Could you 
tell me if pine will run uner Unixware 2 and where I can get it and how 
to install it.  Pine is the BEST email program around...I glad it is free 
but in all fairness you should start charging for it....it is great!!!!
Thank you....Jeff Gordon....

We are currently doing experiments to "determine the feasibility of a Mac
port."  A Mac port of Pine, if one is released, would be very much like
Windows Pine -- that is, it would be text-oriented with only a minimal
amount of GUI features (some menu and mouse action).  The goal is to keep
the Pine interface more or less constant across ports.

There are also native IMAP clients for the Mac such as Mailstrom and
MailDrop.  I like MailDrop a lot, and I expect to see a demonstration of
the latest Mailstrom later today.  See
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.software
for more information about these and other clients.

Andy,

Thanks for the info.  I took a look at this and, while it seems like a
powerful indexing tool across files, it does not seem to have the ability
to create the type of output (I'm looking to create a viewable directory
or a text file) I'm looking for.

Thanks.  Any other ideas out there?

Has anyone found a telnet client that runs reliably under Windows 95

enough to support it yet) and is now upset because he can't print his
email messages anymore.  

Everything worked fine under Windows for Workgroups using Novell's Lan
Workplace for Windows telnet program.  I've tried two telnet programs
in 95 so far (the built-in one, and something that's part of a package
called EXceed) without any luck.


Anyone... ?

Thanks in advance for any help.

When a message is received from an individual, is there a way to add that
single address to a list in a personal addressbook? I tried this awhile
back. If there were multiple addresses, it seemed to work. How is it
done, or can it be done, for a single address? 

I'm using Pine 3.91. Thank you in advance.

Just use PC-Pine. I've been using it with Win95 since early
last summer without any glitches at all.

A Pine user here asks if there'a any way to display the X-Face headers
contained on some messages.  Like with most MUA's, the only way to do
it would seem to be by piping the message to a program that extracts
the header(s) for input to the appropriate viewer.  Has anyone created
a script for doing this on UNIX?  Please respond via e-mail since I
don't read this newsgroup.  Thanx,

Oh great pine gurus, I humbly kneel and implore your assistance:
Been running 3.91 on SunOS 4.1.3_U1 for 1 year.  Runs great except:

During a spell-check, if no keystrokes are entered for 10-20 seconds,
pine seems to freak out. It prints 'Killed' and dies to a shell prompt.
In fact the entire telnet session is frozen (neither ^C nor ^Z revive it).

Disk space and ps table are ok.
Checked perms on /tmp and /var/tmp. They seem ok:

drwxrwsrwt  4 bin      staff         512 Jan  8 13:52 /tmp
drwxrwsrwx  2 bin      staff         512 Jan  8 13:49 /var/tmp

Has anyone else seen this?
Any ideas?
Might pine 3.92 solve it?

    If you are using Unix Pine, you can use procmail or filter to prefile 
incoming messages into folders which Pine can then read.  Nancy McGough 
has a lot of good material on this.  If you have a Web browser, look at 
my home page and follow the link to Nancy's pages.  (You will have to 
follow down several links to get to the material on mail filtering.)

Dear piney-folks:

I get a 30,000 -- 50,000 character e-mail digest each week from a mailing
list I subscribe to.  Does pine have a way of viewing a digest as a list
of separate letters in a folder?  It would make forwarding or saving
sections of it easier.

Thanks,

This is a matter of considerable debate.  For more information, see

Pine 3.92 will understand included text; at least to some degree...

This will be available in 3.92.

I am getting really worried about some problems we are experiencing with 
PINE since I upgraded to PINE 3.91.

1. Our main campus email server, a SUN OS 5.4, was upgraded to PINE 3.91 
and people are now LOSING MAIL. Looking at the last message in their 
INBOX we have found a TAB, Ctrl/Z, or Octal 177 character in a line by 
itself at the end of the message. Following that there are multi messages 
tagged on the end of this last message that never show up in the INBOX. 
PLUS This last message just keeps growing and adding messages. Once the mail 
recipient realizes that something is funny, usually by printing his last 
message which lists ALL the messages, he notifies us. We can then edit the 
INBOX and remove the offending character.


2. I just received this NEW message (see below). It shows in my INBOX with a 
date of xxx 13. When I look at the message, a question mark shows in front 
of the date 13 Feb 94. Note when I forwarded the message the '?' changed to 
a '^T' . We upgraded to  PINE 3.91 on a Sun OS 4.1.4 after 
running PINE 3.89 for a long time with no problems. This server only has a few
users so the volume isn't there to generate the problems such as I'm 
getting on the main campus email server.


Can someone PLEASE help.  I will be forced to revert back to PINE 3.89 if we 
can't resolve this problem soon. Does anyone have any ideas at all? 

Thanks for your help.

Is there any possibility the folder was accessed from a PC via NFS or
otherwise changed by something other than Pine or the usual delivery
agent?

I see the same thing.  The sender of that message apparently has a
broken mailer or cc:Mail gaqteway that is sending bogus date
headers...

Hi. I am a student at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA/USA. We have an 
OSF1 operating system (Unix-based). Users in the on-campus computer labs 
as well as users accessing from their home PC's encounter a problem when 
printing from Pine - after each print job, a blank sheet of paper is sent 
through the printer. Is there any way to prevent this from occurring? 
Thank you.

Closer to what? 1997? ;-}

Hello,

About Pine version 3.91 for windows

I have tested OpenVMS PMDF IMAP4 by hand with the command:
a002 list "" "*"
This results in a correctly formed list with all my (remote) folders

* LIST (\Noinferiors) NIL MYFOLDER
* LIST (\Noinferiors) NIL SCRATCH
* LIST (\Noinferiors) NIL PATHWORKS
...
A002 OK LIST completed


But I can not get PINE to show this list, Is there a workaround or
some settings to get these folders from the open VMS system?
By the way the INBOX folder works correctly.

Please send responses directly, I am not subscribed to this list.

Thanks, Roel

Hi.

Does anybody know if there's ANY way to redefine any of the Pico special
editing keys?  We have used ^^ (Control-Carrot) for years as a special key
to switch sessions on terminals connected to terminal servers.  We have
just started using Pine on VMS.  If a user in Pico enters ^^ the terminal
server intercepts it.  Changing the special key on all of our terminal
servers would be a major undertaking. 

I've looked through the last years' archives and found several
suggestions, but any successful creation of the ^^ keys still ends up 
with the same result:  The terminal server intercepts it.

What we really need to do is redefine the 'Mark' key to be something 
besides ^^. ??

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi,
   i've read the FAQ on Folder Problems and it seems that my problem 
could be related to the folder lock deal, but i'm not sure.
   We have a number of UNIX boxes in our department. Recently we added 2 
more Alpha machines, and we've always been using a common file sharing 
system. On the older machines, Pine 3.91 works like a whiz. But with the 
newer machines, no configuration changes have been made, but everytime we 
Goto a Folder, it would give the following error above the 2 rows of 
Commands at the bottom of the screen:

[Error creating /users/a/anuja/unix/mail/foldername.lock: I/O error]

Although it doesn't lose any mail, and does the saving and moving of 
mails to the folders properly, but the error is worrisome. This has 
happened to any user who tries to use Pine, not just me. We've checked to 
ensure that no other Pine session was open.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Anuj.

>From time to time, I acquire too many messages in a specific folder to 
read in a manageable period of time. Or, I may want to accumulate a large 
number of messages from a specific discussion group.

Of course most sites have limited disk space and ask users to maintain 
small numbers of messages in the message base.

Ideally, it would make sense to offload the incoming messages to my local 
PC at home, and read them off-line. However, as I recall there is no 
current system for PINE for off-line reading.

However, should I want to preserve a batch of incoming messages in a pine
readable format (not ASCII text files), is there an appropriate way for
compressing the raw message data for a specific folder with high traffic
in order to reduce the amount of disk space consumed when large quantities
of messages accumulate? 

Any suggestions? Thanks very much.

Bye for now,

Does the new version of Pine (3.92) provide disconnect mode?
I would be happy if Pine would do that, because I would present PINE-IMAP 
connection betwen my laptop (win95) and the windows NT PC at the CEBIT 
in Hannover.

Is there any other mail client which could be used in disconnect mode 
with an imap-server? 

TIA
gerhard

P.S: I have just installed the Imap-server from washington at my windows 
NT machine. It looks good ...

Gerhard,
Alas, offline and disconnected support will not make it into the "almost
ready" 3.92 version, but both are definitely planned for later this year.

Siren mail and Sun's Roam client both support disconnected operation;
however, the Siren client doesn't use IMAP4 UIDs yet, and Roam only runs
on Solaris.  I'm told that a Windows version of Roam and IMAP4-compatible
Siren are both coming...  I think there may be one more IMAP client with
disconnected support, but it has slipped my mind.

I've CC'd the IMAP list in hopes others will speak up.

Try this patch: in pine3.91/imap/ANSI/c-client/os_lnx.c, change a line
which reads:
	#include <sys/socket.h>
to be:
	#define iovec blurdybloop
	#include <sys/socket.h>
	#undef iovec

Many versions of Linux have the wrong definition of struct iovec in
<sys/types.h>, so c-client defines it with the right definition.  In some
other versions of Linux, <sys/uio.h> defines struct iovec, and for some
reason <sys/uio.h> is included by <sys/socket.h>.

Linux is not for the faint-hearted.  There are many different variants of
Linux floating around, and it can be difficult to make source files that
compile correctly on every variant.  We make Pine compile correctly on the
variant that runs on our Linux boxes.  We do distribute pre-built binaries
for Linux, so if you have trouble in the future you may wish to use our
pre-built binary instead of dealing with sources.

Agent has the ability to cancel your own posts.  I don't know if Free

Actually, this is c-client's algorithm, not Pine's, and kicks in only if
you do not specify an override with Pine's inbox-path variable.

This only happens if c-client is built with the mbox driver enabled.  By
default, it is not enabled in the imap-3.5 toolkit used in Pine 3.91 or in
the imap-3.6 toolkit used in Pine 3.92.  It is enabled in imap-4, but we
haven't decided whether that will go into Pine or not.

The enabling is done by the setting of the EXTRADRIVERS variable in the
c-client Makefile.

This is usually the preferred technique to get the behavior that you say
you want.

If you do decide to convert, the mbxcvt tool in the imap-utils toolkit may
be very useful for you.

Well, speaking as a highly biased observer, I would say that this is the
path of wisdom...  ;-)

Undeniably.  But there is an important caveat:

And here's the caveat:
	Don't even think of using the mtxt (a.k.a. tenex) format over NFS
	with c-client (Pine, imapd, etc)!!

The problem here is that Pine uses update mode (O_RDWR) random access I/O,
based on the presumption that the buffer and inode caches reflect what is
actually on the disk.  This is very fast; however, NFS violates most of
the underlying assumptions.  There is no guarantee of synchronization of
the kernel buffer caches between different machines when an update
happens, and worse the inode cache can get out of synchronization with the
buffer cache on the same machine!!!

Even worse, there is *no* locking when NFS is involved, so there is no
guarding of critical code when simultaneous read/write access happens.

*Usually*, c-client will detect that something is hosed, and decline to
proceed any further; there haven't been too many clobberage incidents.
But, "verbum sat sapenti", a word to the wise is sufficient...

My advice; if you use tenex format, use it on a real filesystem that
follows the documented Unix semantics (certain operations documented to be
atomic are, certain operations documented to update the disk do, certain
operations documented to semaphore do) and not an imitation filesystem
such as NFS that simulates some of the semantics and throws up its hands
on others.  This means that if remote access is desired to tenex files,
you should use IMAP.

If you must use NFS, you're better off with the Unix mbox format.  You
lose some safeguarding with mbox as well (and it's slower to boot), but
you still have a basic locking semaphore in place.  Also, the mbox code
doesn't keep the file open except when doing actual operations, which
permits the crufty NFS kernel to get the buffer and inode caches back into
synchronization.

====================================
Random Signatures in Pine (for Unix)
====================================

-----------
Quick Intro
-----------

Pine has a nifty little kludge that allows it to call an external editor
(CTRL-_ -- control-underscore).  In actuality, it can call any external
program, which allows you to do Many Cool Things.  Examples: a script that
strip headers for forwarding mail, a script that strips off excess >'s, or
a script that does random signatures.  Of course, if you want all three,
you can have a script that gives you a menu allowing you to choose which
function you want.  (Note that Pine also has another kludge, the |
command, which allows you to pipe messages into any external program --
exploring those possibilities is left as an exercise for the reader). 

So...you want random signatures.  Easy enough.  Enclosed is a script that
does it.  

------------
Requirements
------------

Obviously, if you're using the CTRL-_ command to actually use an alternate
editor, you can't use it to append random sigs.  (But then, most alternate
editors allow you to call external programs from within them anyway). 

It's a perl script, so if your system doesn't have perl, it won't work. 
To find out if you have perl, type "perl -v" without the quotes at the
Unix prompt.  If you get back a message that says "This is perl," you have
perl.  If you don't, you don't. 

------------
Installation
------------

1. Make a directory in your home directory where you will store your
signatures:

           cd
           mkdir signatures

"signatures" is the default.  If you use something else, edit the second
line of the script (that line that starts with $SIGS_DIR=) to whatever
name you're calling your directory.  For example, if you were calling your
signatures directory "siggies", then that line of the script would read

           $SIGS_DIR="$ENV{HOME}/siggies"; 

2. Edit this file, removing everything up to (but not including) the
#!/usr/bin/perl line (#!/usr/bin/perl should be the first line in the
file).  Save the edited file in your home directory and call it "randsig". 

3. While at the Unix prompt, give this command:

           chmod 700 randsig

4. Now fire up Pine.  At the main menu, type S (for Setup) and then C 
(for Config).  You'll see the Pine config menu.  Look for these two lines:

            [X]  enable-alternate-editor-cmd
            [ ]  enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

If you don't have Xs in the right place, use the arrow keys to move to the
boxes you need to change and then press ENTER to toggle the X. 

5. Almost done.  Now tap the space bar two or three times until you reach 
nearly the end of the configuration file.  The line you're looking for is 

            editor                 = 

Move the highligt bar over that line and press C (for ChangeVal).  The
enter "randsig" without the quotes and press return.  Now press E to exit
config. 

You're done!

--------
Using It
--------

Store each signature you want to use as a separate file in ~/signatures
(or whatever you called it).  Whatever files you store in ~/signatures are
candidates for the random signature script, so only store signatures in
that directory.  You can have as many as you want.  The file names are
inconsequential. 

To use the script, simply compose or reply as normal, then press CTRL-_
(control-underscore) when you're done.  Pine will call the script which
will append a signature and put you back into the Pico editor.  Then (as
usual) press Control-X to send your message. 

----------
The Script
----------

#!/usr/bin/perl

# Edit this line to the directory where you keep your sigs
$SIGS_DIR="$ENV{HOME}/signatures";

opendir (DIR,$SIGS_DIR) || die "Can't open directory $SIGS_DIR!";
@signatures=readdir(DIR);
closedir(DIR);
shift(@signatures);

$num_sigs = @signatures;
srand (time|$$); # seed with the least significant part of time
$chosen_sig_number=int(rand($num_sigs))+1;
$chosen_sig_name="$SIGS_DIR/@signatures[$chosen_sig_number]";

# I know, I know -- this next command is UGLY.  I'm sure there's
# a Perl Way<tm> of concatenating files, but I didn't feel like digging 
# through the Camel book to find it.
system ("cat $chosen_sig_name >> $ARGV[0]");

Subject: INBOX folder construction, impact on existing mail.txt and mbox
Message-Id: <4d73d0$ks6@ornette.uchicago.edu>
Date: Sat, 13 Jan 1996 01:54:40 GMT
Status: O
X-Status: 


We're introducing official support for Pine at the U. of Chicago, in
the beginning of February, and are working out some configuration
details. If I'm forgetting anything, please let me know (post a
followup here, or email me if you prefer, ckk@uchicago.edu).

We are starting out with the existing /var/spool/mail/$USER mailboxes,
NFS-mounted from a server, not introducing IMAP yet. (sorry I couldn't
make it to the IMAP Consortium meeting in Seattle this past week, I
would have loved to have gone, maybe next time...)

I just did some experiments regarding Pine's algorithm for
construction of the "INBOX" folder, to report for a meeting on Monday.

1. If you have an existing "mtxt" format ~/mail.txt file, Pine wants
to use that as part of the INBOX folder, i.e. it will slurp new mail
out of /var/spool/mail/$USER, append it to mail.txt, and display the
entire contents of mail.txt as your INBOX.

2. If you have an existing ~/mbox file, Pine will prefer to use that,
instead of mail.txt, as the place where it appends truly new
/var/spool/mail/$USER messages, before displaying the whole bunch as
your INBOX.

3. If you have neither an "mtxt" mail.txt file, nor an mbox file, Pine
will just use the contents of /var/spool/mail/$USER as its INBOX.

These considerations are important to people who have existing
~/mail.txt files (from MM) and/or existing mbox files (from Berkeley
Mail etc.), perhaps with large numbers of old messages there.

If they try Pine, it seems that Pine is going to show them all their
many old messages, as being new and unread. (I could say, that's what
they get for leaving all their old messages in one monolithic mail
file :-) but I've got to try and ease their transitions.

We want to minimize the number of site-specific configuration
changes. But we are interested in setting the system-wide Pine fixed
config file combination:

read-message-folders=saved-messages
feature-list=auto-move-read-msgs

to sweep mail, after it's read, OUT of the INBOX folder (i.e. out of
the files /var/spool/mail/$USER and ~mail.txt and/or ~mbox).

We're also considering setting

inbox-path=/var/spool/mail/$USER

which would tell Pine to ignore the mail.txt and mbox files. That is,
this will force Pine's INBOX folder construction to use ONLY the
/var/spool/mail file, NOT the existing legacy ~/mail.txt or ~/mbox
files.

If we do set this inbox-path, and a user does want to "import" their
existing mail.txt or mbox file into Pine, they can simply move the
whole file, into their mail subdirectory, and Pine will then see it as
a folder.

Currently many people still use "MM" with their "mtxt" format
~/mail.txt files, and we have bad problems with "corrupted" mail.txt
files, due to bugs in old MM where it doesn't quite finish writing the
file out before dying, and the new invocation can't read it. The
"mtxt" format is inherently more delicate than the "mbox" format,
since it has the binary flags which include one for the message
length....

We had been assuming that we would have to do a massive "conversion"
of all these existing legacy "mtxt" format ~/mail.txt files, into
"mbox" format instead, to eliminate the corruption problem.

Now I have recently decided to try and trust the Pine/c-client team,
that they have fixed many "mtxt" bugs since the days of old MM
c-client, and NOT convert the file formats after all..... wise or
foolish? (we'll find out :-)

A major question for us will be whether Pine's handling of "mtxt"
format (in ~/mail.txt as part of INBOX, and/or an "imported" folder
moved into the mail subdirectory) is more robust than MM's.

I am hoping/betting that Pine will not "corrupt" mtxt files the way MM
frequently does. But if we do still get a lot of corrupt mtxt files
from Pine, we'll have to think about converting them.

One concern is that the "corrupt" mtxt files may come during NFS
outages, if people run the mail program (MM or Pine) on a host other
than the one where their home directory is actually physically
located. If this is the case, then even Pine might not be able to
prevent the mtxt file corruption problems? I haven't been able to test
this reliably yet though. (we have made an effort to urge people to
login & run their MM on the same host where their home directory
lives, rather than go across NFS, and we will continue to do so with
Pine)

Am I forgetting anything? :-)

See above ... doesn't matter how you're connected (not gonna comment on

not by date recieved, or worse yet, by the date you moved it into another

will sort it by (sent) date.  Hope this helps.  BYE. 

PS  once you set your default under (s)etup (c)onfig to 'sort by date', 
you still have the other ($)ort options available with the $ key, but the 
default will be a date (sent) sort.  Hope that makes sense !

I am looking for a text editor which is easy to use and can be put into a
restricted mode which disallows all shell access, and restricts file saving
and reading.

The restricted mode of PICO which is available through PINE is good, but
I can't seem to convince PICO to enter this mode without PINE.  I have
tried setting gmode |= MDSCUR in a couple of spots within the source, but I
still get a non-restricted version...

A similar feature in a newsreader would be cool, too, but is not necessary.

I have set up a system with a menu under rsh, in which the pico user can
save files, but only in the current directory.  Wouldn't that do what you
want?

I would appreciate deeply if anyone of you know if there is such
C-shell script which will hold off all the incoming mail from a
certain "From:" address sent to a user between 10:00 PM to 7:30 AM
(next day) and resend them back to the same user next day at 7:31 AM.

Bascically here's the flow:

If From="john.doe@pizza.com" and $TIME is between 10:00 PM and 7:30 AM,
  mv ~/mail/pending/mail.1 ~/mail/pending/mail.1+1	
  Save newmail to ~/mail/pending/mail.1
endif

Next I'll have another script which runs in cron, and looks for the 
existence of the ~/mail/pending/mail.* and resends them back to the 
$USER one by one till each of 'em is delivered when $TIME = 7:31 AM

Any pointers, sugegstions are most welcome and maybe sent to
shrim@thunder.temple.edu

Many Many Thanks.

   I'm running pine 3.91 under Linux.  I connect to my ISP using a PPP

   Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening?  Might it have
something to do with a sub-optimal MTU setting?

   Any info would be greatly appreciated.

    Pine as such probably cannot (although I won't swear to it).  One 
possible circumvention is to use UUENCODE, presuming your recipient has 
the corresponding UUDECODE.  Some versions of UUENCODE will break a file 
into segments of no more than a specified size.  You could email each 
segment as an included file (not as an attachment).  The recipient would 
then extract and concatenate all the segments in order and UUDECODE it.  
A bit of a kludge, I admit, but it should work.

    Normally, you do not upload while you are composing in Pine.  
Uploading is a separate operation distinct from Pine.  You did not say 
so, but apparently you are using some variant of Unix.  In that case, you 
start the upload process from a shell prompt, not from within Pine.  
Exactly what you do will depend on what softare is available on your 
system.

    For example, in my case I enter rz -a or rz -b depending on whether I
am uploading an ASCII or binary file.  (Actually I use a tiny shell script
in order to get the version of rz on my system which supports Zmodem). 
Then I start ProComm Plus' upload with the keypad PgUp key.  Select the
protocol (Xmodem or whatever) and supply the path and filename on your PC
when prompted.  Things should take off, and you should get the file
uploaded into your Unix current directory.  THEN you start composing in
Pine and include the file with Ctrl-R. 

: software (which is PROCOMM-PLUS), using XMODEM, YMODEM and ASCII options. 
: None have worked.  (My software doesn't have ZMODEM, so please don't tell 
: me that's what I need.)

    ProComm Plus (at least version 2) supports Zmodem, which is better 
than the other protocols in some ways.  However, the software on your 
Unix host also has to support it.  As I say, my host has two versions of 
rz, only one of which supports Zmodem.

: I realize this may not be a PINE question but rather a UNIX question,

    Yes, it is a Unix question, not a Pine question as such.

    No.  Pine will not do this.  You have to use a mechanism which gets 
hold of the mail _before_ Pine does.  A widely used tool for Unix systems 
is procmail.

The long-awaited OS/2 port of the Pine mail/news reader version 3.91 has 
been uploaded to hobbes.nmsu.edu in /incoming as pine391.zip.

-- README.OS2 --

This is a port of the Pine 3.91 mail user agent to OS/2 32-bit
compiled with the emx 0.09b development system, gcc 2.7.2. This
includes only the mail UA client and the pico editor, no imapd.

Notes on the OS/2 version of Pine:

 . This is a text mode only version of Pine.

 . Like the PC & Windows versions, this version of Pine is intended
   to be run primarily as a network client.

 . The following client mailstream drivers are supported by Pine-OS2:

     imap,nntp,pop3,bezrk,tenex,dawz,dummy

   This is the same as PC-Pine, with the addition of pop3.
   To enable pop3 over a network link, use the folder
   specification:

     {site.domain/pop3}INBOX

   The pop3 driver has not been extensively tested, however.

 . The "alternate editor" command is active in this version via
   the ^_ key.

 . The spell checker is enabled, by default calling gnu ispell.
   Internal spell checking facilities are disabled in Pine, so
   the spell checker itself must provide the interface (as is
   the case with ispell). The "SPELL" environment variable
   can specify an alternative spell checking program.

 . All help is included within the executable itself.

 . The mouse is enabled and working under OS/2 to the same
   extent as that available under Windows/MSDOS; ie. it works
   for some functions but does not include anything very advanced.

 . Unlike the PC versions of Pine, the addressbook functions work.

 . Attempts have been made to ensure that all files produced and
   used by Pine conform to 8.3 mapping of the FAT filesystem. It
   has not, however, been tested on FAT. Needless to say, the HPFS
   filesystem is fully supported.

 . The pipe command '|' is enabled and functional. Avoid piping
   mail to any interactive command, however - it will not work.

 . Printing has not been tested. For expedience, the UNIX model of
   piping output to a command has been used. You may like to use
   the OS/2 port of the BSD lpr command or similar, or pipe to any
   other command according to preference.

 . Pine-OS2 maps itself to the current display mode, adapting to
   the current screen size to suit.

 . Pine-OS2 provides 16 foreground colours and 8 background colors
   to select from (rather than 8 and 8 with PC-Pine).

 . This version of pine is fully UNIX shell aware, and uses the
   SHELL environment variable in preference to COMSPEC when spawning
   other process. This was tested with the csh and ksh ports.

 . Debugging is not enabled.

Requirements: OS/2 2.x with TCPIP 2.0 or later installed (IBM's IAK is
fine). emx.dll version 0.09b or later placed somewhere in the LIBPATH.

Set the HOME environment variable in your CONFIG.SYS to a directory you wish
to use for a work area. Reboot. Move Pine.exe (and optionally Pico.exe) to
any directory in the system PATH. Set the TMP and/or TEMP directory to point
to a directory to be used for temporary files. NOTE: This directory must
exist prior running pine or bad things may result. You may use the PINERC
environment variable to point to an alternative configuration file if
necessary.

Run Pine. Follow the directions presented, and before doing anything else
you should select S)etup C)onfigure and run through all configuration items
and preferences. You may have to exit and restart to access folders.

Read the documentation for further information. Note the syntax of setting
up network folders, folder collections and so on:

  Network folder:  {site.domain}path
  News collection: News *{site.domain}[]

If you specify 'INBOX' as path, this is magic for the inbound mailbox on the
specified server. Note that over a 14.4K link I've had more luck with using
imap to read news than nntp from a performance point of view. NNTP seems
very slow - imap works better. To set this up:

  NNTP-Server: site.domain
  News Collection: News *{site.domain/imap}[]

imapd needs to be running on the news server, and you need to have an
account on that machine, of course, otherwise nntp must be used.
Irrespective of which method you use to read mail, nntp is still used for
posting, hence the requirement for the nntp server name.

Enjoy!

I have a patch that does this. From the Release Notes:

============================================================
= Changes in 3.91jh803.
=  
= 3.91jh803 is a patched version of 3.91 that can handle encoding/decoding of
= header fields according to RFC1522. Some other changes has also been
= done. The differences from 3.91 are:
=  
= 802:
=     - Encode a lonely '.' on a line. Recommended by RFC1521.
=  
= 801:
=     - handle application/pdf when sending PDF-attachments.
=     - better support for 8-bit characters in folder names and in
=       address book
=     - view application/pgp (without interpreting the PGP-stuff)
=  
= Earlier patches (from 3.91 to patch 800):
=     - RFC1522 suppport (added by Lars Engebretsen <enge@nada.kth.se>)
=     - should now work (I hope) for all character sets in the
=       ISO-LATIN family.
=     - some memory handling bugs fixed by using Purify on PINE.
=       (Not totally "clean", but better than before).
=     - (small) improvements in the makefiles and build-script. One reason
=       was to make it easier to use CVS on the code.
=     - Fix to avoid showing text message from some MAC MUA's as attachments.
=  
= The RFC1522 suppport is used in the following way:
=  
=     - when reading mail it is automatically used
=     - when sending mail you have a choice when sending the mail.
=       See the help (Ctrl-G) in the compose screen. Read about the
=       SEND command (Ctrl-x).
=  
= This patch was created by Johan Holmberg <holmberg@upp.promotor.telia.se>.
=  
============================================================

I have used this patch a lot on SunOS and IRIX, and beleive it works
on Solaris-2 and HPUX too. Shouldn't be any problems for other platforms,
but I just haven't modified the Makefiles for other platforms.

But, since 3.92 isn't far away, I'll probably not do any further work
on it.

Anyway, if you want to try my patch, send me an email and I'll
send you the patch.

The function you are after is nothing to do with Pine (or any other mail 
reader, for that matter).  These are programs for reading mail *after* it 
has been delivered into your mailbox folder.

What you need to be looking at is the delivery mechanism itself, and in 
particular how to persuade it to redirect the arriving mail.  This is 
*not* Pine but, usually, a system program called "sendmail".

Try looking through the man page for sendmail for the section about 
".forward" files.  These are what you need to use in order to redirect 
arriving mail.

Cheers,

Hi!

Is there any way you can specify Pine to automatically move any post from 
a specific user (in this case the address of the mailing list) from your 
Inbox to an area created by yourself? 

One more question about Pine: How can you (on user level) make Pine able 
to read/write letters using the MIME format? Can it only be done during 
installation? 

Oh, and one last thing: How do you make Pine throw in your .signature in 
the *bottom* of quote-replied messages instead of in the *top*? 

If you have the answers for one or more of the above, please write me. 
Thanks.

Thank you very very much for doing this port! It runs faster than
the windows version, too!

: -- README.OS2 --

: This is a port of the Pine 3.91 mail user agent to OS/2 32-bit
: compiled with the emx 0.09b development system, gcc 2.7.2. This
: includes only the mail UA client and the pico editor, no imapd.

: Notes on the OS/2 version of Pine:

:  . This is a text mode only version of Pine.

:  . Like the PC & Windows versions, this version of Pine is intended
:    to be run primarily as a network client.

:  . The following client mailstream drivers are supported by Pine-OS2:

:      imap,nntp,pop3,bezrk,tenex,dawz,dummy

:    This is the same as PC-Pine, with the addition of pop3.
:    To enable pop3 over a network link, use the folder
:    specification:

:      {site.domain/pop3}INBOX

:    The pop3 driver has not been extensively tested, however.

:  . The "alternate editor" command is active in this version via
:    the ^_ key.

:  . The spell checker is enabled, by default calling gnu ispell.
:    Internal spell checking facilities are disabled in Pine, so
:    the spell checker itself must provide the interface (as is
:    the case with ispell). The "SPELL" environment variable
:    can specify an alternative spell checking program.

:  . All help is included within the executable itself.

:  . The mouse is enabled and working under OS/2 to the same
:    extent as that available under Windows/MSDOS; ie. it works
:    for some functions but does not include anything very advanced.

:  . Unlike the PC versions of Pine, the addressbook functions work.

:  . Attempts have been made to ensure that all files produced and
:    used by Pine conform to 8.3 mapping of the FAT filesystem. It
:    has not, however, been tested on FAT. Needless to say, the HPFS
:    filesystem is fully supported.

:  . The pipe command '|' is enabled and functional. Avoid piping
:    mail to any interactive command, however - it will not work.

:  . Printing has not been tested. For expedience, the UNIX model of
:    piping output to a command has been used. You may like to use
:    the OS/2 port of the BSD lpr command or similar, or pipe to any
:    other command according to preference.

:  . Pine-OS2 maps itself to the current display mode, adapting to
:    the current screen size to suit.

:  . Pine-OS2 provides 16 foreground colours and 8 background colors
:    to select from (rather than 8 and 8 with PC-Pine).

:  . This version of pine is fully UNIX shell aware, and uses the
:    SHELL environment variable in preference to COMSPEC when spawning
:    other process. This was tested with the csh and ksh ports.

:  . Debugging is not enabled.

Hi:
Sorry!  This is my second posting, since I don't know if the first
one "took."

Can you put comments in the .forward file ?
If so,  how do you do it ?
Thanx,  Byrg

Your posts are coming through. I don't know, but the filter FAQ might help:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/

  Since it's usually a one-liner, I don't think most people have ever 
needed to comment it, but if you are using it for filtering, then 
procmail and filter's rules files can cerr certainly have comments. (#)

Hi,
Sorry if it is a FAQ.

I'm new to Pine and would like to know any ways or tools available to
allow multiple users to update the global address book?  Since it is a
read only file. Right now only one person can update it.  I'd like to
see if there is any way to update it using different ids. 

Thanks a lot!

I use PINE here at Univ. of Maryland.  I checked with  local
system administrator who didn't know the answer to this question.

Is there any way using PINE to set a flag in a message
to "confirm receipt", i.e. have receiver's mail processor 
send a message to confirm recipient's reading or message
delivery?  Other email systems which I use which have SMTP
gateways allow specification of this "confirm receipt" option.
How do you do this in PINE?

No.  Pine is a mail user agent (MUA), in charge of presenting mail to
you, and helping you format outgoing mail messages.  Reshuffling mail
automatically is the job of mail delivery agents (MDAs).

One very useful program for presorting mail is called "procmail".  You
can run it via an entry in your ".forward" file (all of which is
covered in its documentation).  Using procmail you can sort incoming
mail into different mailboxes, process it in arbitrary ways, and
generate outgoing email responses based on incoming mail messages.
Procmail can be used as the basis for simple mail sorting, on up to
complete mailing list management systems (for which see the related
software SmartList, available at the same site).

Code for procmail can be found at:

	ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de

in directory:

	pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

No. But there are other programs that can do this for you.  See my reply
to the article shortly preceeding this one ("Autoreplying to emails").

As far as I know, it does this automatically anyway... Didn't know it
could be set up not to.  I punt this one.

When in pine: Main/Setup/Config

I have successfully compiled Pine 3.91 on a DG AViiON machine!  I don't
know why the following works, it just does.

Machine: dgux devel 5.4R3.10 generic AViiON mc88110

pine3.91/imap/ANSI/c-client/os_d-g.c
  - add a line.  Shown with '+'.
  - This was posted by several other people.

   #include "log_std.c"
   #include "gr_waitp.c"
   #include "tz_sv4.c"
+  #include <utime.h>

   #undef utime

pine3.91/pico/composer.c
   - Function: ArrangeHeader().
   - I traced the error to this piece of the code.  It would never
     return from this function.  I couldn't see anything wrong, but I
     added '{' and '}' to the "while" statement because I was adding
     debug statements.  Shown with "^^^". 

  line 1630:  while(headents[e+1].name || (l && l->next)) {
       1631:    if(l = next_hline(&e, l)){               ^^^
       1632:        ods.cur_l = l;
       1633:        ods.cur_e = e;
       1634:    }
       1635:  }
             ^^^
pine3.91/pico/makefile.d-g
  - change two lines.  Not sure if this is necessary, but it started
    working right after I did this.  I changed the lines to use "dbx".
    After stepping through the program while trying to "reply" to a
    message, it worked.  I exited "dbx" and it worked from the command
    line.

  line 51: #includes symbol info for debugging
       52: #DASHO=      -g
       53: #for normal build
       54: DASHO=       -O

CHANGE TO (enable debugging):

  line 51: #includes symbol info for debugging
       52: DASHO=       -g              /* removed # */

That '+' sign helps me distinguish my personal mail from my mailing list

If you are Using Pine for Unix and SendMail, try using a .forward file, 
and spcify there the address you wish to forward your messages to.
More documentation on .forward in "man elm".
Good Luck :)

You don't at the moment: Pine 3.91 has no concept of kill files.

Your closest approximation (for e-mail only, not Usenet News) would be to 
run your arriving mail through a filter program such as "procmail" to 
weed out messages whose subject/author you don't want to see.

Cheers,

...But of course, there is no guarantee that Elm (an alternative mailer 
to Pine) is installed on their system!

The "official" place to read about mail forwarding would be in the man 
page for the software that actually _does_ it: the mail delivery agent.  
Our system, like most UNIX machnes, uses "sendmail" as the mail delivery 
system.  So a "man sendmail" is more certain to be there.  (But you'll 
have to skim through some guff first in order to reach the bit about 
forwarding; look for mention of a ".forward" file.)

I don't know my arse from a hole in the ground when it comes to software

incapalbe of being navigated with the cursor arrows or with the "K" or 
"J" up/down commands the program specifies.  Therefore I cann't make

You need to find (on your system or on the Net) software that can be used 
with your mail delivery system's delivery mechanism.  Basically most UNIX 
systems allow the mail deliverer program to pipe the arriving message 
through a program rather than writing the message directly into the 
recipient's mailbox.  The program the message is piped through can then 
inspect the content and decide where to file the message (or junk it!).

If you don't have procmail on your system there may be an equivalent, 
such as "filter".  Try rummaging around or (shock, horror!) ask your 
help desk/system manager/service provider for assistance.  After all 
_they_ should now what is available on your system (I don't!).

If the worst comes to the worst you could consider ftp-ing procmail from 
an archive site on the net, and compilinig it up yourself.  It doesn't 
need any special privileges, as far as I am aware, if you want to place 
it in and use it from your own disk area.

Good luck!

I've been running the NTMail with eval keys for a couple off months
now, and it is absolutely brilliant. Not only was it simple to
install, there hasn't been a single glitch so far. 

Configuration is all done via a control panel applet, and it is
possible to remotely administer the server.

Later.

         Questions relating to Pine Port to VMS

         I have users that want to see the word 'CREATE' rather than
         COMPOSE a mail message (they generally want to re-design the screen
         and the order in which options appear).

         They want to add their own fields to the address-book - e.g.
         extension number.

         Is this possible?  Or should I tell them to be happy for what they
         get.

         Thanks in advance

The only problem is, its buggy (and like all other versions of Pine, as far 
as I can tell, somewhat frustrating).

It took me quite a while to determine that in order to access your inbox 
using IMAP you must specify it as {imap.host/imap}inbox.  The doc implies 
that /imap is not needed. 

I also tried setting my sentmail folder to {imap.host/imap}sentmail.  This 
doesn't work so I can't access any folders which are managed by IMAP. 
However, you can do {imap.host}sentmail, which creates a sentmail file in 
your home directory, but that is not how an IMAP client is suppossed to 
create remote folders. 

The worst bug seems to be that when I only have 1 new message in the inbox I 
can see that I have one message but I cannot access it.  When a second 
message arrives I can then see both.

When I deleted messages, if I did not "expunge" them then the messages sit in 
the inbox marked deleted. If I exit Pine and then restart it the messages 
still show as in the inbox, but without header information and are not 
accessable.  Worse, they can't be expunged by Pine (although Simeon was able 
to delete them).

The annoyances:  Esc should take you back one level.  It's not a PM app.  
Although a mouse "pointer" shows up, it apparently doesn't do anything.

Pine is MUCH faster than Simeon, but since I can't access my remote folders 
(other than the inbox) and it can't read my inbox with only one message in it 
(a frequent occurance - I move them to other folders), I'm pretty much stuck.

However it is that you have that one person update it, you can have
others, too.  The idea is that global address books won't be changing out
from under you while you are running pine.  However, there are some checks
built in so that changes will almost always be detected and occasional
changes will not be too annoying.  For a global address book to be
writable by a user, that user could move it to the address-book list (so
it is a personal address book for them).  They would also have to have
write permission on the files and directory in which the files are
located.

We have a customer who is interested in the following:

When she adds a phone number in the comment field in her PINE address
book, she would very much like to see this comment field on the screen (as
well as all the other fields) rather than manually editing the line and
typing C (for comment field). 

It is an interesting request.  Is it possible to have such a feature in 
the next release of PINE?

Thanks very much.

Good advice.  This probably doesn't need to be said, but that change is
not permanent (i.e., you'd have to do that every time you open a session). 
Fortunately, you can the "Save Set" command to save that configuration to
a "telnet set" (which you should then use in the future to invoke your
session).

If you use Telnet 2.6, under Edit -> Preferences -> Sessions you can change
those keys so that they become PERMANENT for that particular session....

The only thing for the mac at the moment (and I'd like to be wrong about
this!) is to open up a mac terminal program like NCSA Telnet or Zterm
(depending on your connection), and run pine remotely on the unix box. 
Since pine is an all-text e-mail program, it works on any dumb terminal
pretty much as well as on the unix machine itself. The only thing you
have to do is help your users learn to use Telnet, which is no big chore. 
This, of course, assumes that they know how to use unix already.  :-)

Below, documentation is a branch (MH files are top_leaves).

Pine's alternate editor command (CTRL-_) can actually call any external
program you specify in setup, config.  Having it call a script that
implements random signatures would not be terrible difficult to write. 

You'd be composing in pico, finish your letter, and hit CTRL-_ to call the
script.  The script would take the file (the name of which is passed to it
by pine as the first command-line argument), concatenate a random
signature, and then exit, returning you to pico, where you'd hit control-X
to send the letter on its merry way. 

I frequently use CTRL-_ as a facility to call scripts.  If you really get
into it, you can even write a menu allowing you to choose which script you
want to call.

It should, by default, arrange them alphanumerically, except that the 3

of the list before any new ones you have added.  If that's not what it's

I would find it useful if Pine would explicitly indicate when messages

Hi to all,
I`m currently installing pine as the mail delivery system on our site.
I have one problem with pico I cannot resolve with the manuals. Pico 
replaces some characters with special codes when sending a mail.

Example:
	<tab>Siemens ->  =09Siemens
	=====        ->  =3D=3D=3D
	<ret><ret>   ->  =20

Is there a way to turn this off ??

Thanks for any reply,
norbert

Okay, now I understand how to configure PINE so that it can READ the ISO character set, but is
it possible to configure PINE so that users can compose messages using the ISO character set?

Many thanks,

And perhaps she would like to pay to have everyone's terminals replaced 
with ones having wider screens?  There's a limit to how much information 
can be fitted on an 80 character long line. :-)  I for one would be 
definitely opposed to splitting each entry onto two lines (you'd get far 
fewer entries per screen, making use of the address book that much harder).

I seem to be unable to unsubscribe to any newsgroups (& using pine for 
the first time as newsreader) -- when I am in the newsgroup list (huge! 
as I haven't been able to edit it down) and a given newgroup is 
highlighted, I hit "d" for delete and then confirm with "yes" when 
p[rompted to.When I reopen pine, rather than seeing the shortlist of 
subscribed groups I expect, I get the whole, enormnous, list ofd groups 
again. What am I doing wrong or forgetting? (BTW the pine help file was 
of no help on this)

I think this is a keyboard-mapping problem and not a problem with Pine.

I've had a problem develop with Pine 3.91 over the past couple of weeks
(I've been using 3.91 at least since June '95) where it hangs for over 2
minutes in the "sending message" mode after I finish composing and send.
It seems to be delaying by the same time interval (2.5 minutes) Pine uses
to query the inbox.  After hanging, which it doesn't do every time, it
finishes sending and goes back to normal operation. Quitting and
restarting doesn't help, nor did rebooting the workstation (Sparc20). 

Anyone else had this problem?

Hi,
  i'm new here too, but i'd like to help as much as possible. 8)
To send a binary file, simply put the filename (the full path if 
necessary) under the Attchmnt: option in your header. It's as simple as 
that! LONG LIVE PINE! 8)

Hi There,
My pine mailer used to automatically save a copy of all outgoing

Hi,
   i've read the FAQ on Folder Problems and it seems that my problem 
could be related to the folder lock deal, but i'm not sure.
   We have a number of UNIX boxes in our department. Recently we added 2 
more Alpha machines, and we've always been using a common file sharing 
system. On the older machines, Pine 3.91 works like a whiz. But with the 
newer machines, no configuration changes have been made, but everytime we 
Goto a Folder, it would give the following error above the 2 rows of 
Commands at the bottom of the screen:

[Error creating /users/a/anuja/unix/mail/foldername.lock: I/O error]

Although it doesn't lose any mail, and does the saving and moving of 
mails to the folders properly, but the error is worrisome. This has 
happened to any user who tries to use Pine, not just me. We've checked to 
ensure that no other Pine session was open.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

nuj.

A dumb answer: the ^-stands for the control key of the keyboard. To
enter ^X, press the control key of your keyboard and hold it down while
pressing the X-key. If your keyboard has no control key, try 
ESC ESC X a alternate way to enter ^X

Hi,
you might want to check in your pine config (either .pinerc or thru' the 
menu config) where it says Default Folder=  .. just make sure there is 
some folder name there. Hope that helps.

I'm not quite clear what you are actucally asking here.

Are you wanting to move messages you have read out of the INBOX and into 
another folder?  If so (and assuming you are using Pine 3.91) use the 
Setup (S) command at Pine's Main Menu, followed by Configuration (C).

Then set up the name of the folder they are to be moved to as the value 
of the "read-message-folder" variable.

When you quit Pine it will now ask you whether you want messages you have 
read moving into this folder.  If you don't want to be asked but have the 
messages move automatically you will need to turn on the 
"auto-move-read-msgs" option too.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Go into the Setup Configuration screen.
Check you still have a value set for the "default-fcc" variable.

(Is it my imagination, or doesn't anybody bother looking at the Setup 
Configuration screen before asking for help? :-)

Perhaps it could be done the same way as is currently the case with long 
addresses. They do not fit completely on the screen (80 chars) but are 
visible by increasing the window (I am using pine in an xterm :-)). 

The comment field could just be added behind the address field. Thus it 
could be made visible by increasing the window size for people who are 
lucky enough. So all without this possibility would have no loss compared 
to the current situation. 

I have to admit that I also would be very much interested in a visible 
comment field.

I don't see smtp here. Is that so basic it's a no-brainer, or is it
missing. My provider has pop3 to deliver mail to me, but I use smtp
to send it.

I am currently supporting many users on a unix cluster.  I get a LOT 
of mail.  I find it very confusing to have all my old mail (by 
semester) in the folder list.  I would like to make it so I can 
access a folder that has a list of folders in it (it has the list of 
old mail)   
Can anyone make suggestions as to how I can put these folders 
somewhere else where they will be easily accessable, but not right 
under my nose?


Also, this may be in the bug-report area of your operation, but why 
does pine always try to mark messages as deleted when I browse my 
saved-messages folder?  I always find myself having to answer no to 
"expunge 6 messages from saved-messages?"

Thanks very much for any input.

Standard way to send is, when finished composing, hold the CTRL key down 
and press the x key.
Does this not work for you?  If not, tell us what happens when you try it...

This is not a pine bug.  It is a failure of your mail transport
(sendmail?) overflowing some fixed-size buffers and not recovering
correctly.  Sometimes setting "smtp-server=localhost" is enough to
work around the bug...

Jacques,

For all of the time I have been on the internet, I have conformed to the 
netettiquete guidlines of four lines per signature (to which I note you 
do not adhere).  Recently, however, I feel that we (my company and 
myself) have been so sorely used, cheated, deceived and scammed by both 
Microsoft and Compuserve, in different but equally sleazy ways, that I 
have no other recourse than to do everything in my power to warn others 
in the computing community to how these behemoths are behaving.

If either company sees fit to rectify the situation, I will be only to 
happy to return to my humble, four line sig.  But other than shaming them 
on the net, I have no real power against these giants.  I choose not to 
bend over and pretend I enjoy it, like so many others I see.

I cannot get this to work with pine 3.91 (metamail 2.7) but elm which 
should use all the same code is fine.

Any ideas?

Thank you.

I assume that you are using Pine on VMS.  VMS Pine will "move" messages
from INBOX to MAIL.  Use the "L" command to see a list of all your
folders, and check to see whether the message is in any of those.

I may very well have the details (which folders, exectly what gets done
with the message, etc) wrong, but I beleive your mail is in another
folder, unless you really did delete them, and it doesn't sound like you
did.

Yes.  When your cursor is in the "headers" of the message, type Ctrl-J
and follow the instructions.

if you are using Pine on VMS from Innosoft (part of the PMDF product) then
Pine does NOT do so for you automatically. via auto-move-read-msgs you
may have configured Pine to do it for you, but otherwise messages are not
moved anywhere unless you Save or Delete them.

I installed PINE for OS/2 on my Warp/connect machine.  BUT ... it sucks up all 
available cycles, even when doing no more that waiting for keyboard input.  
This is indicated both by very balky behavior (i.e. bringing another window to 
the foreground may take 30 seconds to a minute), and buy the Pulse cpu 
monitor that comes with Warp.

What can I do about this?

thanks,

This is a tougher problem.  Pine requires a first and last name, and uses 
them both in the addresses and to sort the file (on the last name).

Eudora does not require these and if they are there, are there as part of 
the address, such as "Joseph Davidson <jdavidson@interguru.com>" (quotes 
not included.)  The name does not have to be in any special format.

This means for me to convert back, I would have to do some educated 
guessing -- actually mind reading -- on what the name of the recipient is.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Considering how many happy users there are, you may be in the minority.

May be it is just you.

But to come across with just disdain as you have will only make
people just hit the <DEL> button on the email.

Maybe you should try to be a little constructive with your
criticism (sp).

    If you actually opened (looked at) the messages and then exited 
without taking any other actions, Pine may have transferred them to 
a saved-messages folder.  Try looking for them there.

    Yes.  As an attachment.

It's so basic that it's a no-brainer.

A "mailstream driver" in the sense of Pine's internals refers to reading
email.  Posting is a different issue.  NNTP is listed because it's used
for both reading and posting.

Pine as distributed by UW has both SMTP and NNTP posting code.  It would
be work to remove it.

	Wow....my first thought was that you must be working for the
competition.  But, I thought about it a bit more and came to the conclusion
that that could not be the case.

	You may not be aware of this, but "pine" is a *freely* distributed
email UA.  It was written at the University of Washington for use at the
U.  The individuals working on the "pine" team work for the U.  It was
decided to release the software *freely* for anyone to use *as they choose*.

	I searched the pine source and was unable to find the quote you cite.
I was able to find, "There are now hundreds of thousands of Pine users in 
over 40 countries".  So, maybe you have exaggerated slightly?

	In any case, you are free to use pine if you wish.  If you don't
like it....then you don't have to use it.  So, I doubt the term "inflict"
is appropriate.

	This mailing list and newsgroup serves as a vehicle for people to
discuss pine.  The people on this list generally discuss the good points,
bad points, and offer constructive criticism on pine.  I'm sure if you
take the time to draw up a list of the problems you have experienced the
folks of this list and the U would be most happy to consider what you have
to say.  You do point out that you are a "new" user of pine.  I would think
that also means you are new to this newsgroup/list.  If that is the case
you are unaware that the "Pine Team" is open to suggestion from the user
communitiy.  This is true, even if the Internet user community is not the
ones paying their salaries.  (Please note: "open to suggestion" does not
mean that they will implement features or change the behaviour of pine 
solely on the comments/request of a single individual.  The fact that
they may decide against your suggestion does not imply that they did not
consider your proposal.)

	However, if you feel you there is no hope for pine and nothing you
can contribute will help to fix the problems then you should switch to
a different and better user agent.  And, by all means, let the other around
you know about it.  People should be happy with their user agents.  And,
if fact, many people are very happy with pine.

	But, what do I know?  I'm working for that other horrible company.

	Oh, BTW, when you were unhappy with Control Data's software did
you submit a PSR (Programming Systems Report)?  

	Good Luck....

Could you please be more specific?  As pointed out by others, we are
open to specific suggestions from everyone.

We don't have the resources to review other vendors' software.  There
is nothing about the default Pine configuration that would adversly
affect other products.  Thus the "method for users to to replace" Pine
is simply to install the new software according to the vendor's
instructions.

Correct.  We do what we can for users outside the U, and consider all
sugestions, because we find that serves to improve Pine for everyone.
With several hundred messages/week coming in, we have to scan through
them pretty quickly though...

I believe the note in the source was written before we had a good
handle on how widely distributed Pine has become.  I believe the
"millions of users" phrase has been used by Pine Team members in the
pine-info list.  At last count, we have received some form of e-mail
from over 2.4 million Pine users.  We don't have any statistics about
how many of them are "happy" with Pine or still using Pine.

    For current Pine, the appended posting appeared last year on 
interfacing Unix Pine and PGP.  I cannot vouch for it.

You can cut/paste more than one line at a time in the Composer.  Use
the "^^ Mark" command (that's the Ctrl-^ key) to set a "mark" at the
beginning or end of the composed text you wish to delete or move, then
move the cursor to the other end of the block of text to be "cut".
Now you can use the Ctrl-K key to cut the selected text.

Have a :-) day,

"Tin" is a program for reading and posting articles to Usenet News (a 
sort of world0wide bulletin board system).  Tin is a dedicated news 
handling program.  However other programs now offer you the ability to 
read and post news articles too.  For example some World-Wide Web 
browsers (such as Lynx and Netscape Navigator) and, of course, Pine.

If you want to find out more about reading/posting Usenet News articles 
from Pine then this is the place to ask.  If you are more interested in 
Tin in particular you should try the "news.software.readers" newsgroup.

Cheers,

In my old e_mail system i could define a specific mail folder to a full 
names or a nick name address. So any time i sent a mail to, say,  
Michel that mail was saved not in the default folder Sent-mail but in  
another folder named IMP

Any idea to do it with Pine?

Most of the problems you have are problems configuring it correctly, not

{imap.host.domain.}INBOX

and it works just fine.

I use

{imap.host.domain.}mail/sent-mail

To access the folder collections I have on the server, i use

{imap.host.domain}mail/[]

Of course, I already had been using pine via a telnet account, so
perhaps things were set up a little easier for me. But I don't see why
you should have any problems reading your folders or having your
sent-mail configured correctly. It's just a matter of discovering the
correct syntax.

The other problems are wierd. Haven't experienced them, but also haven't
been in a position to experience them.

How about getting over your unwillingness to learn a product which you 
DON'T have to pay for!  You evidentally haven't looked at what else is 
available!  My users were thrilled the day I installed pine and have had 
nothing but good things to say since.  If you are having problems with 
the product, it is more likely that your provider has crippled some 
functions to keep you from shooting yourself right squarely in the head!

You don't upload directly into pine.  First upload the text file and give 
it a filename (e.g. upload1).  There will now be a file 'upload1' in your 
home directory on your unix server.  Then when in pine compose (or reply) 
mode, with the cursor at the point where you want to insert the file, 
press ^R (control + r) then type the filename (upload1) press enter and 
it should appear.

: I've tried, while in composing mode, to upload using my communications 
: software (which is PROCOMM-PLUS), using XMODEM, YMODEM and ASCII options. 
: None have worked.  (My software doesn't have ZMODEM, so please don't tell 
: me that's what I need.)

See above, you have to be out of pine to do the upload.  You may be 
able to temporarily suspend pine with ^Z if you have that option enabled.

: I realize this may not be a PINE question but rather a UNIX question, but 
: I don't really know what I'm talking about here, as you can probably 
: tell. Please help or point me the way towards help.  Thanks a lot.

PS upload it as a binary file ... yes I know it's text, but do it.

BYE   Hope this helps.

Dear sir,
   i'm afraid i have to disagree with your comments. I work in a 
university where i have contact with new users day in day out. We have 2 
different email UAs, one is VMS MAIL, and the other is Pine. After 
introducing Pine to everyone i meet (and this averages 10 per day), they 
love Pine so much that they can't get enough of it. VMS MAIL gets chucked 
out the window. Pine has always been preferred. Please give it a chance 
and you will (hopefully) love it too. 8) .. LONG LIVE PINE ! 8)
   have a good one. 8)
nuj.

4. Look at menu at bottom of screen. Select default-fcc field.
5. Give foldername for this field.

Whenever you send a message to that nickname, or to the _exact_ full

Hi,

I am using accents and other extras from the ISO-8859-1 character set in PINE
but only through keys I have defined. This has its limits because there are 
not sufficient keys you can redefine (it will not cover all the accents and 
german umlauts).

With Emacs I am able to use the compose key (or multy_key) to access all the
special characters. Is this possible with PINE ? How would one do it ?

	Thanks for any help

		Jan

	Something you may want to try is setting up pine to use an
alternate editor.  You can do this in the setup/config menu.

	You can set either:

          [X]  enable-alternate-editor-cmd

	or

	  [X]  enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

	and

	editor = path to emacs.

	See the help in the config menu for mor info on the alternate
editor.  

	After you set it up you could use emacs which seems to supply the
functions you require.

	Regards,

The name in the pine address book doesn't have to have a comma.  If you
use Joseph Davidson as the fullname, then it won't flip the first and last
name around.  You'd lose the sorting on the last name, but that's all.

Hi, to Steve Harrington:
I have been using Pine for a very long time.
It is an excellent e-mail program!

I admit it takes a little effort to learn the advanced features, like 
1) using a .forward file with the UNIX filter() function to direct 
   incoming mail AUTOMATIALLY to some of your Pine folders as well 
   as to other I'net addresses;
2) using Pine to retrieve selected Usenet Newsgroups AUTOMATICALLY.

But cheer up!  If you track this mailing list, you too can learn;  I did.
BTW,  you'll notice there is a message here about the Pine archive files,
which undoubtedly contains MUCH info for newbies.  
Also try the FAQ's often mentioned in this mailing list.

Greetings,  Byrg      (a Pine fan!)

Beware however that life is not as simple as it seems. I am using this 
methodology for some shared lists, using groups for access control.

When updating a global list in the way suggested I find that the access 
is all screwed up: pine's re-writing of an addressbook seems to make 
assumptions contrary to what I need. I want perms =-rw-rw--- (because 
this is a restricted list); pine insists on putting -rw-r--r-- (because 
only owner should write and anyone can read), and resetting group=owner.

That means that to get the perms back correctly a special script must be 
run every time they are updated. 

Ideally Pine ought to leave the perms alone (for addresslists; I can see 
why it is paranoid about folders).

Pine support,

Is this a known problem ?? About 95% of the time when adding a folder to 
the Incoming Message Folders collection, Pine crashes with basically two 
different symptoms. Most often I get an error message:

Bug in Pine detected. "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
Attempting to save debug file to .pine-crash

Less frequently, Pine apparently goes into a loop and the CPU usage is maxed.

I am using Pine v3.91 on the Linux operating system. All of my folders 
are on the ISP's server (allowing me to use either Pine PC or Unix Pine 
on the local machine). The Pine binary is unmodified from washington.edu.

With the abort signal, Pine does accomplish most of the task ... the 
folder is created on the server and the local .pinerc file is updated.

The reason for massive maintenance on the folders was due to just 
implementing mail filtering with procmail and setting up the new 
collection of Incoming folders.

After a multitude of failures, I resorted to a work around .. I made the 
entries to the .pinerc file for the Incoming folders I wanted established 
and created the files on the server in the directory for folders.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Aloha,
/PA

I am maintaining some pretty big mailing lists and using the

Awhile ago, I reverse engineered a basic mailing list that I

someone share a perl package for manipulating the addressbook

with the comment field in 3.92?  Thanks ...

Hi

You can use any name you please in Pine...I have several with only one 
name as "Full Name".  As long as you remember the nickname, you can 
always find them.

I think Pine is a *VERY* good mail package and I learn a new feature
almost every day!  I have learned so much about the product just from 
being on this mailing list!  I think it is one of the best.

Cheers!

Marsha

Hello everyone,

we use Pine 3.91 on a HP running HP/UX 9.0x. The user data is kept on a
hard disk of a DEC running Ultrix 4.2a which is also NIS and DNS server
for our domain. 

Whenever one tries to write to hard disk pine freezes and the classical
deadlock situation occurs. Pine is in sleep mode (therefore, we aren't
able to kill it) and locks (a) the terminal and (b) the open <folder> with
<folder>.lock. This situation is not very promising and some users get a
bit upset - don't know why ;-))

This effect doesn't occur on our Linux machines, so that I'm inclined to 
think it's got to do something with the connection HP - DEC, though we 
can use elm having not the same results

Any comments (flames *not* included - sorry ;-) are welcome. Send an 
email or post to this group.

Thanks in advance

Norbert

Hi mailers,

	Currently we are using elm on the system and still plan on
	using it in the future. We also want to investigate putting
	pine on the system. The problem that arises is that a person
	can be in both elm and pine at the same time (diff. ttys).
	Under elm, it locks out a second attempt to run it by the
	fact of /tmp/mbox.login existing. Pine appears to give the
	second attempt of pine running read/write over the first
	pine session that is switched to read only. Note that I
	am talking about the system mailbox in all of this. It appears
	that pine determines who has read/write access by creating
	a file on /tmp called something like '.C<something>'. I don't
	really remember for sure, but I noticed that this file was
	777 with a pid number in it. Is this a little security prob.?

	Anyway, I was wondering if any one in these newsgroups had
	a standard way of elm and pine locking each other out. I can
	come up with something, but it would be better to use a
	standard way if that exist. I did not see anything off hand
	in any of the documentation.

	Also, I have not seen it in pine yet, but I was wondering if
	it had an option (compile time) to lock out second pine session.
	Doe pine operate directly on the system mailbox or is it using
	the 'inbox' in the 'mail' directory? Might be nicer if it used
	something on /tmp, since sometimes our user partition is a little
	tight. Maybe this would be a way to have the lock out between pine
	and elm, pine could use /tmp/mbox.login instead of ~/mail/inbox
	(if ~/mail/inbox is what it actually uses).

	Any help would be great. Direct email to douglas@dekalb.dc.peachnet.edu
	is the best way. I can post a follow up later on with a
	summary of responses that I get.

Cheers,
Douglas

I sort of stumbled over it - pine told me once (or twice) when I was
repeatedly pressing CTRL+K :

Are you using NFS or IMAP to access the mail?  If you are using NFS,
you are probably experiencing a file locking failure.  The only
reliable way to solve this is to install IMAP service and use it
instead...

Different systems deal with locking over NFS differently.  Some try to
make it work but fail while others don't even try but report success :(

I was wondering if pine 3.90 could be used as a POP client?

If you're interested, here are the results of my investigations:
My answer at this point would be NO, as when I try
	incoming-folders= {mail.bnbcomp.net/pop}jewels
in my pinerc. 
I get:
	[Can't open mailbox {mail.bnbcomp.net/pop}jewels: invalid remote 
	specification]
The "invalid ..." says it all.

What I am less clear about is whether IMAP is a superset of POP, and 
then I would assume that IMAP would be backward compatible.
But this might be true for the server, not for the client..
So I try:
	incoming-folders= {mail.bnbcomp.net/imap}jewels
I get
	[Can't connect to branwyn.bnbcomp.NET,143: Connection refused]
Same for 
	incoming-folders= {mail.bnbcomp.net}jewels
Upon doing some digging, I come to the conclusion that 143 is the tcp 
port for the IMAP protocol and that my server does not have an IMAP  
server.

I posted my question on comp.mail.pine, and received two answers,
one was off-base, the other gave me the idea to use incoming-folders.

Thanks for any help you can give me,

Julian Gordon.

  others when I say Pine a very good product. Maybe what would be

<grovel mode>

In an attempt to gain efficiency, we decided to try using the tenex
mailbox features of pine.  

To do this, I created a mail.txt file in the home directory of a bunch
of users, which I had read was the way to go about this.  

Of course, now we have the problem -- for most of these users, the
this mail.txt has been ignored completely -- mail comes from
/usr/spool/mail/$USER and goes back there when they quit.

For a few of them, their mailboxes were converted to tenex in their
home directories, but now Pine doesn't recognize the mail.txt file at
all, and has gone back to /usr/spool/mail/$USER ... 

If I copy their mail.txt to their mail/ directory, pine CANNOT open it
as a folder.

The users .pinerc's are indentical between those who are affected and
those who aren't.  /usr/local/lib/pine.conf and their .pinerc's DO NOT
have incoming-folder set to anything.

% uname -a
OSF1 front V3.2 148 alph

frontier: fran % uname -a
OSF1 frontier.wilpaterson.edu V3.2 148 alph

It was built for OSF1 - the only changes to the source was the 1 line
"no runaways" patch.  It is not running over NFS.  Nothing was done to
the source to activate tenex (ie EXTRADRIVERS.)

I've read the thread below, and the FAQ, and done dejanews searches --
I can't find anything relevent..  Please help!!

Thanks a lot!

You could have mentioned that in the subject field.   Now, are
we talking Yehavi's free port here, or one of the chargeable jobs?
I only know about the former.  You understand of course that none
of these ports are officially supported by Washington...

Since you've got the source, everything's "possible".  Is it
cost effective?  Is it robust against future releases?  Are you
willing to invest the maintenance commitment for the future?

I have a couple of fixes for local problems, that are not too
much effort to migrate from one release to another, but I'd still
prefer not to have to schlepp them along.

You took the words right out of my mouth!  ;-)

You might find something useful in my notes:
http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html

though nothing that's specifically related to your questions.

good luck.

You can reply to his message and it will be included, so somehow it
is converted and sucked into Pine.

Ha, I hit this problem yesterday, but I have been unable to reproduce
it since, on my Sparc 10. I use procmail to sort incoming mail into folders,
but it can't be related to that.

Maybe it's something to do with lockfile though. Do you happen to use
procmail ?

What you want is called 'folder-collections'.  Rather than giving a long 
explanation here, try this, and if you still need help, feel free to 
email me or post a followup.

In pine type L to get to your folder list, then press ? for the help
screen, then space bar a few times, and you will see a pretty good
explanation of how to do it. 

Also in pine from (M)ain screen (s)etup (c)onfig highlight the line 
'folder-collections' and press ?

other users using Lotus Notes - and vice versa?

Pls let me know.

Thank you,

Yosi Ben-Dov.

After a couple of email messages with David we both came to the conclusion 
that the problem must be due to the fact that we are using the University of 
Washington IMAP4 server. Apparently, the Pine IMAP server is IMAP2.

Hello,

I have the following problem:
I must control the incomming of emails from several accounts from 
only one terminal (No X-Window :-(( ). I created a folder collection 
"Incomming message folders" and added the /usr/spool/mail/<xx> mailboxes 
to this collection.
But only the INBOX is checked for new mail. Is it possible to watch
all the folders in the "Incomming message folders" for new mail 
automatically ?.( Currently I must look in every folder  from
time to time to check for new mail )

Thanx in advance,
	Norbert

Perhaps the word 'restricted' was a bit vague.  PICO, when used in PINE's
'restricted' or 'demo' mode, will only edit the file specified in the command
line - you cannot load a file from elsewhere, nor can you save the one you are
editting to any other file.  The only outside intervention allowed in the
editor is an interface to 'spell'.  My problem is PICO the standalone does not
have the ability to be a restricted editor.

I would like to use this editor as the standard editor for my BBS (which uses
rocat as a base).

I assume that neither recognizes a lock file of the other
as I have never seen any mention of it before.
However, I think that it would be possible if both used file locking.

Well, I'd discourage a lock file in /tmp as this can be local to the host
and thus you can only detect it if the call is made on the same host.

I'd favour a lock file within the user's account (~/.elm or ~/.pine) to make
sure that the lockfile is seen whenever the user is calling the program.

This assumes that the user has a home dir on the machine where he calls
the program.  Is this always true?  Can someone log in on a host where he
has a shell but no a home dir?  Not sure here.

The lockfile should also include the name of the host and the process id.
Obviously, this makes it much easier to find the host and the process id
which makes it easier for sysops to fix problems.

Btw, programs like netscape and nn do just this.

Example:
Starting ELM on host "leibniz" might result in process id "6467" and
ELM would create file "~/.elm/lock.elm.leibniz.6467".

Of course both ELM and PINE would need additional code to recognize these
lock files.  And some code to "ignore that damn lockfile".  :-)

You can cycle thru your incoming message folders using TAB, and it will
only open them if there are recent messages, but there is currently no way
in Pine to get asynchronous notification of new mail except for INBOX and
the folder that is currently open (if other than INBOX).

We have changed the OS. on our e-mail server from SCO ODT 
3.0 to SCO 5.

I have compiled and installed pine, pico and imapd on the 
SCO 5 syetem.

It looks like the installed imapd is working as it should. 
The only thing in that respect is that now we have to 
specify the exact path to folders on the SCO server (e.g. 
{slam}/usr/eks/mailfolders/[] on the SCO 5, where only 
{slam}mailfolders/[] was needed on the SCO 3.0).

Unfrotunately, though, the SCO 5 system is very unstable 
and I can't find out why. Therefor I would very much like 
to know if others are using imapd on SCO 5 without 
problems.

We also have the SAMBA server installed and running on the 
SCO 5 system, and I would also very much like to know if 
others are running both imapd and SAMBA on a SCO 5 system 
without problems.

Thanks in advance for help

Pine should work equally well with either the IMAP4 server or the
IMAP2bis server distributed with Pine...

Julian,
Your conclusion is correct: IMAP is a functional, but *not* a syntactic,
superset of POP, and the two protocols use different ports.  You are also
correct in inferring that your site is probably not running an IMAP server
if you get a connection refused on port 143.

POP does not have the capability to name mailboxes; it only has the notion
of a single "maildrop"  (i.e. your INBOX) --hence the "jewels" name made
the specification invalid.

As a test, press G (for GoTo) and enter:  {mail.bnbcomp.net/pop}
or use that string as your "inbox-path".

Note also that:

 o There are some bugs in the POP driver that was distributed with Pine
   3.91.  If you are serious about using POP, you should rebuild Pine with
   the current c-client 3.6 library.

 o Pine does not yet support offline mode, which is what POP was
   designed for, and what most people want when they speak of POP support.
   Using the POP driver for accessing your INBOX, Pine will attempt to
   operate in online mode even with the limitations of POP.  A future
   release of Pine (*not* 3.92, alas) will offer true offline support.

 o Pine 3.90 was replaced by 3.91 shortly after it came out (over a year
   ago) because of some serious addressbook bugs.  You should encourage
   your site to upgrade.

 o The UW imap server is easy to install and coexists with pop daemons
   (especially, but not necessarily, if you use the pop daemon that comes
   with our IMAP distribution.)

   Hello, everyone!

   How can I send a message to ALL users having mailboxes on my server
(laima.acad.latnet.lv)? I'd like to do it without typing 100 or
more usernames in the To: line...
   And how about sending such a message to users of another server ? (I
don't have an account on this second machine.) Thank you in advance. 

   This is probably not a Pine-specific question, but I am quite new
to the Net, so 	I don't know where else to ask.

Subject: Bug (ID ZZ8BV): Printer and Screen Fonts 

	When printing to a local (desktop) printer with PC-Pine for Windows
3.91, the printer fonts do not match the screen fonts, and they do not match
in a bizarre way: when printing to the HP IIP LaserJet printer in my campus
office (using a direct ethernet connection to the server, if that makes any
difference) the printer fonts are about 2 points _smaller_ than the screen
fonts, but when printing to the HP 500 DeskJet printer from home (using a
dial-up SLIPP connection) the printer fonts are aboout 2 points _larger_ 
than the screen fonts.
	Is this a bug, or is there something I can do about it (other than
changing the font size before printing, then changing it back again
afterwards)?

The format is described in the technical notes that are in the doc

Right, I had forgotten about that.  Barry mentioned this to us before and
it has been fixed for the next version.

I am trying to write a Eudora-to-Pine script.  If anyone has some

: alias ZimbabweNet Zimbabwe@mathcs.cmu.edu
: note ZimbabweNet [this line contains all kinds of things about ZimNet,

: alias CFNPP [addresses of several co-workers]
: alias "Joe Blow" jblow@econ.cit.cornell.edu

	Hi! I'm using procmail 3.10, and having a problem with it 'filing' two

cut-n-pasted it. :-)

	I don't want to put it into full-blown use via .forward until I've got
this one figured out, because double-articles negate whatever time I've saved
using procmail to file things for me. For reference, I've included my

Can anuone explain how the assume-slow--link feature (3.91) could appear 
to be activated even though no changes were made to the Pine 
configuration?   Yesterday, all of a sudden, I realized that the 
highlight bar which is always across the current message was no longer in 
evidence.  Instead, there was just a little > to the left of the current 
message.  I checked config but the assume-slow-link area had not somehow 
mysteriously gotten checked.  Today, it is back to normal, but I would 
like to know how it could have happened...

I'd like to know what the limit is as to how many people you can put into

trouble sending to over 25 or so people at a time per line, but haven't 
been able to figure out a precise limit.  I couldn't find anything in the 
man pages about it.  What do you know?  Or is this a "sendmail" total 
limit, and if so what is the total limit?  Does it matter how one divides 
the names between those three "send" lines?

Thanks in advance for everyone's help.  :-)

Thanks to everyone who responded.

The correct sequence is Ctl-^ (Ctl-SHIFT-6).

NOTE: The manual page is incorrect -

    Blocks of text can be moved, copied or deleted with creative
    use  of  the  command  for  mark  (ctrl-underscore) ...

Hi.


I read all the guides I could find about pine, but I did not get any answer
to a specific problem. Anyway I fear that this is a total lamer question, but
I do not have any clue...


I want to use a remote inbox. I installed imapd on that remote server. When I
setup the {the.remotemachine.name}whateverbox entry I always get a

[Can't connect to the.remotemachine.name,143: Connection refused]


In the technical notes I found something about that you need a certain file
in your remote home directroy to allow access. But it was not written which
file and what its syntax should be:

"With this configuration, the IMAP server runs without pre-authentication.
Each new IMAP connection requires a correct username and password. IMAP can
also be run with pre-authentication based on the standard rsh mechanism. To
enable this, the user account on the IMAP server must contain a valid file
which grants access to the client machine."
(taken from http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/tech-notes/installation.html#install-imapd)


I also set the username and the password euqal on both machines, but it did
not seem to help. If I did something wrong in the /etc/inetd.conf - how can I
check if the imapd is running well?  What else am I doing wrong?

First, thank you Joseph for contributing the script.  After seeing a 
recent post about it in this group from me, Bruce Pleat of Qualcomm 
contacted me and asked for a pointer to the script.  So keep your eyes 
open.

Indeed, going from Eudora Nickname --> Pine address book is a much 
tougher problem.  Joseph Davidson mentioned that:

>Eudora does not require these [first and last name] and 
>if they are there, are there as part of 
>the address, such as "Joseph Davidson <jdavidson@interguru.com>" 
>(quotes not included.)  The name does not have to be in any 
>special format.

The last sentence here is the key -- there is no special format, not 
even a regular or predictable format.  For example, my nndbase.txt 
doesn't look at all like your example.  Here's a few lines [names 
changed to protect the innocent]:

alias ZimbabweNet Zimbabwe@mathcs.cmu.edu
note ZimbabweNet [this line contains all kinds of things about ZimNet, 
including unreadable ASCII chars for carriage returns I typed in the 
Eudora Note: window]
alias CFNPP [addresses of several co-workers]
alias "Joe Blow" jblow@econ.cit.cornell.edu

So first the script would have to clean things up by trashing all lines 
beginning with "note", and getting rid of the "alias " at the beginning 
of all the other lines.  Parsing the Nicknames themselves, however, is 
tougher, because if there is a space in the nickname, it is enclosed in 
quotes, but if there's no space, no quotes.  As for sorting on last name 
a la Pine........aargh!  And then if it hit a nndbase.txt file with 
names in the format you showed...

Mind reading is indeed required.  Maybe future versions of Eudora could 
make it easier to do this.  Delimiting the nndbase.txt fields with tabs, 
instead of spaces, seems like a simple (perhaps simple-minded?) start.

I would also like it to be as easy to convert my mailboxes from Eudora 
--> Unix (Pine or just plain "mail") as it is to convert Pine --> 
Eudora.

Hello *!

Browsed the documentation ... have still no clue:
How can I post an article with Pine without having defined an NNTP-server?
My link to the internet is via UUCP, thus uux is my news transport.
Mail send and receive and news read work fine.
 
Sys: Intel-PC, Linux 1.2.12, Pine 3.91

I am (not yet?) member of this mail-list, so please reply directly.
Sorry for that ...

Thanks a lot,

Oliver,
The connection refused message almost always means the imapd is not
installed correctly.

Steve,

    You may need to set the environment variable HOSTNAME.  Read up on this
section in the Pine docs.  I use the following scripts to setup a nice public
screen for my Pine sessions (uses wshell and psx): 

PubPine
-------

  AmiTCP:bin/login
  utils:psx open=Pine HIRES DEPTH=1 MAKEDEFAULT=Pine
  c:newwsh 
    CON:0/0/676/234/Pine/FONT#Topaz.font/HLINES#0/NOPROP/NOSIZE/BACKDROP
    COMMAND nos:pine3.91/StartPine

StartPine
---------
  utils:psx MAKEDEFAULT=Workbench
  cd HOME:
  nos:pine3.91/pine
  jump Workbench
  utils:psx close=Pine
  endcli

    I've found that Amiga Pine works most reliably on a monotone screen 
using classical dimensions: 25 x 80 characters.

    BTW once you prove out AmiTCP and PPP, do consider registering both. 
You will be very happy with the registered versions.

I have a question about window size or rather size of the pine window.  
When I telnet to my unix account and would like to change the window

(If it is possible).

re converting eudora nicknames to pine:
specifically, regarding the problem of pine having slots for first and
last name, in addition to the nickname.

No law that says we have to make use of these slots just because they
are there.  Why not nickname all and just put in dummies for last
and first.  I may be getting the format wrong, but something like:

AndrewStarr    last, first    atstarr@amherst.edu

or you could just duplicate the nickname:
Andrew Starr   AndrewStarr, first atstarr@amherst.edu
and leave it up to the user to edit by hand any that he/she is
really concerned about
or something like that.

I stand corrected on two points I made earlier.  Thanks to Scott Gruby 
from Qualcomm for setting me straight.

In article <4dob62$las_002@human.cornell.edu>,

<deletia>

Indeed, Eudora Nicknames files are in a standard format, that used for 
Unix mail aliases (the Unix command mail, not Unix-based mail programs 
like Pine).  One could easily append their nndbase.txt onto their 
$HOME/.mailrc file (after deleting any "note ..." lines) and the aliases 
would be there when using the mail command, which is more of a true 
standard than Pine is.

It *IS* just as easy, but I swear this wasn't the case in earlier 
versions of Eudora, or am I completely losing it?  Just copy the Eudora 
 .mbx file over to the Unix box, and it's readable by "mail" and Pine.  
I haven't figured out yet how the message flags are handled (all N or 
all blank I could understand, but some of each?), but that's not a big 
problem for me.

Thanks again Scott.

I AM A NEW ENTRANT IN THE WORLD OF INTERNET.
MY COMPANY HAD RECEIVED YOUR DOCUMENT "SECRETS OF PINE 3.9" AND
I HAVE GONE THRU IT BEFORE TRYING TO USE PINE.
WHILE USING PINE I AM FACING CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES. SPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF
'SETUP' & 'CONFIG'.
ACTUALLY I WANT TO CREATE TWO SEPERATE FOLDERS FOR 'READ MAIL' & 'DESPATCHED
MAIL' SEPEARTLY i.e. WHENEVER I READ ONE MESSAGE FROM 'INBOX',
IT SHOULD MOVE TO 'READ MAIL' FOLDER AUTOMATICALLY, SIMILARLY ALL
MAIL WHAT I HAVE SENT SHOULD MOVE TO 'DESPATCHED MAIL' FOLDER.
IT WIIL BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED, IF I GET DETAIL DOCUMENTS REGARDING PINE 
AND ALSO YOUR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO USE PINE EFFICIENTLY.
WAITING FOR AN EARLY REPLY.
THANK YOU,

I have to second Joe's vote. We've been running post.office on NT now
for over 10 months. I cannot compare its performance to other mail servers,
since we've not used any others on NT. But I can vouch for the robustness
of post.office and for the responsiveness of the company which makes it,
Software.com.

Steve, you are free to use another free mailer. 

After that you should take the time to think about, how you could 
improve your writing style, i.e.: to be more polite to people who
did nothing more than offering other people software for free.

You have not been forced to use pine.

Try ctrl-^ where ^ is the caret (hat, shift-6) and not another control
for mark.

Ctrl-_ (control underscore) calls the alternative editor, obiously the ^
got formatted funny in the manual.

Subject: How to attach a mail message to mail?

X-Status: 

Is there a way that you can attach mail messages out of your folders or
include them in a new mail message. Similar to including a file from a
directory? I realize that I can forward them to someone, but what if I 
am written a message and I need to include a message or couple of messages 
in what I am writing?

Suggestions... Is it possible? Did I miss something in the Docs?

Thanks in advance..

one way is to just Extract the mails that you want to your home directory 
(by using E and giving a file name) and then when you want to include 
that mail, simply use ctrl r to read in that file.. 8) .. kinda 
roundabout way, but it works.. any others have suggestions?

Hi Gary

One solution to your problem would be to create a Distribution List.  
While in your Address Book, press "s" to "CreateList".  You give it a 
name and then you can add all the names you wish.

I've done that, and while I've not tested the limits of it, it was my, 
perhaps erroneous, understanding that this is the same as listing the 
names manually so far as sendmail is concerned.  The Address Book merely 
deals with inserting addresses into the "send" slot of your mail -- not 
with what comes afterwards.  So my understanding is that this would add 
nothing.  Am I wrong?  If so, that would be valuable to know indeed.

Either way, many thanks for your kind response.  :-)

Subject: Pine on a Wyse50 - How to use cursors?
Date: 19 Jan 1996 19:27:03 GMT
Message-Id: <4dora7$k79@bs33n.staffs.ac.uk>
Status: O
X-Status: 

How do you make Pine use the cursor keys on a Wyse50 terminal?  The Wyse
sends out single character control codes (^H, ^J, ^K, ^V) for the
cursor keys, and Pine expects <esc>A, B, C, D etc.  is there any
way of disabling the built in cursor key codes so it looks in the
termcap file like any other well behaved program?  or is there
a way of forcing it to accept the single character codes and re map them
into the <esc> format codes?

All help would be much appreciated.

Please reply by email to root@village.demon.co.uk

thanks,

Jester (Matthew Jenkins)

Not quite.  There is an option to move read messages to another folder,
and one to "expunge without confirm" but that only affects messages that
have already been marked Deleted.  In the case of "automatic" deletions as
part of moving messages, this only happens after Pine successfully stores
the message in the read-message-folder.

Yes, I've also seen an example of a PC mailer with a broken MIME
implementation.  It couldn't successfully decode a large MIME attachment.
(Replacing that particular PC mailer with PC-Pine solved the problem.)

If you are using Yehavi's free port of PINE, then I would say
that it is probably the VMS MAIL support routines (rather than
PINE itself) that moves the messages from NEWMAIL to MAIL folder
when you have read them.  This is, after all, what happens when
you use VMS MAIL command, and the PINE routines are just calling
the VMS MAIL routines to get service.  (I'm saying nothing about
how PMDF works here, since I have only a passing aquaintance with
it at another site and we clearly have an expert on hand already).

However, PINE would not ask you, under those circumstances,
whether you want to delete the mails.  It only asks that if 
you have marked them for deletion, either implicitly (e.g by
doing a Save to another folder) or explicitly with Delete.

Perhaps the original poster would care to fill in the gaps 
so that we can all clarify our answers.  Or perhaps they tracked
down the mails in the MAIL folder already, and are no longer
looking for an answer...

Use Crtl-^ to set the first mark. Then, use your right/left arrow keys 
for highlighting text in lines and the down arrow key for highlighting 
lines to cut. After hightlighting, use Ctrl-K to delete.

There are two things to check:

1) if you created the ~/mail.txt file as an empty file, are you ABSOLUTELY
   sure that it is empty?  If it is non-empty, it must be in proper tenex
   data format, otherwise it will be ignored.

2) what is the setting of inbox-path in the users' .pinerc?  It must be
   INBOX, not /usr/spool/mail/something.

Pine is fully compatible with both IMAP2 and IMAP4, or more accurately,
IMAP4 supports IMAP2 compatibility.  If you are having problems, please
send a message to pine@cac.washington.edu detailing the symptoms.

The /imap switch should never be necessary.  However, I don't know what
the author of the OS/2 port may have done.

	Ummm....sorry you can have multiple lines and thus multiple
forwarding actions in your .forward.  

	I do know that everything after a "#" on a line is considered a
comment.  I've not tried it a the beginning of a line.

I do not recall if 3.90 could be used to access a pop3 mailbox.  I do not
know that 3.91 can (albeit this is not supported by Pine developers).

In either event, the syntax above is incorrect.  You may wish to
try "incoming-folders=jewels{mail.bnbcomp.net/pop3}"

Actually nothing in this case.  (Of course ^C in the composer, as opposed
to the Send command, offers a way to cancel the message.)

=============================
Sorry, but I think you are wrong!
In the meantime I've studied several references to the .forward file.
I also tested and found out that:

1) any line starting with the # character is a comment line;

=============================
Sorry, but I think you are wrong!
In the meantime I've studied several references to the .forward file.
I also tested and founded out that::

1) any line starting with the # character is a comment line;
   (useful for "commenting out" lines you don't want to erase!)
2) It's OK to have several lines in the .forward file; I've tried;
3) you may put not only a filter() function ALONE on a line;
   you may also put a single FQDN address ALONE on a line;
   (FQDN = Fully Qualified Domain Name, e.g. joe.blow @somehost.com  
4) if you put (a single) FQDN address on a line,  then ALL incoming    
   messages will be forwarded to that address WITHOUT any filtering,
   as well as to you default PINE folder.

Greetings,  Byrg

Seth,

There is old software which came with some Hayes 2400bps modems,
a couple of years ago, which seems to do what you want done.

Because "pine" is often unstable at my ISP, I compose offline,
*including* the email address, and subject, with the appropriate
blank lines, and the entire body of the letter.  After the text
file is complete, I go online and get into pine, and use the
compose command.  Then with the compose screen "blank", I call
the modem software, "EZMODEM" with <F2>.  I select "Autotype"
from the "EZMODEM" menu, while I am in "compose" in pine.
Then I select the file I want to email, and hit <enter>.  "EZMODEM"
fills in the "compose" screen in pine, automatically, while
I watch....  takes a minute, or so.  When it's typed, I
hit ^X and <enter>, and that's that!

BTW, I used Xmodem for that operation....

I wish I could find similar software for a 28.8 USR Sportster modem
which could do just that.  Hm...?  I wonder if "EZMODEM" has been
updated for 28.8 modems?   Does anyone know?


Hope this helps...

Tom

After making a few changes based on David's pinerc I find I no longer need 
the /imap.  I have no clue why it now works.  The most important thing I had 
wrong was that folder-collections was set to nothing.  Once I set this to 
point to the directory where my folders are things were much better.  David 
also had a lot more "switches" set.  I pretty much left all that blank.

I printed the Pine Technical Notes.  I think the next step is to read that.

BTW - the online help is useful, but not altogether clear.

Hi Gary

I see from my own Distlists that it does show all the addresses!  Sorry.  
The advantage of a distlist is that you don't have to manually put the 
addresses in everytime you want to send mail to a certain group of 
people.  That's a lifesaver!! :-)

Maybe you have to be a LISTSERV or a mailing list like "pine-info" in 
order to do it without having all the names appear!  This is a good question 
to ask the owner of this mailing list!  Sooo, owner of pine-info mailing 
list, can this be done??

Terry,
I have the same problem as Oliver. I have installed imapd from university 
of washington on an AIX. Locally it is allright. But when I connect from 
my remote Alpha-computer I get also "connection refused".

If I change the direction (connect from the Alpha to the Aix) there is no 
problem.

TIA
gerhard

I would like to be able to view the full headers of messages which I receive.

According to the help message that comes up when I press "?" while reading a
message,  the "H" command should enable "Full Header Mode".  However,
when I give the "H" command,  I get the message
   Command "H" not defined for this screen.

This happens in both Pine 3.91 and Pine 3.89.

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

-Alan

The one things that REALLY bugs me about Pine is this: When you're tab'ing
through news folders and pass a folder where all the articles have expired
(i.e. there are no articles for that news group on the news server), Pine
insists on telling me "No state for newsgroup found, reading as new" and
beeping, and then telling me "Newsgroup is empty" and beeping.

The latter of these is understandable, but the former should only be shown
when the news group is not listed in .newsrc, no? But apart from it being
incorrect (I think), it's SLOW! Instead of just going on to the next folder,
it pauses for a few seconds on each message, making passing through a number
of these empty folders quite time consuming.

Is this going to be changed (fixed?) in version 3.92?

Apart from that, however, I love it. :)

I found the solution.  In the setup configuration I have to set the flag
called "enable-full-header-cmd".  After doing so,  the H command works.

	I am using Pine v3.91 under FreeBSD and I noticed that when 
posting UseNet news, it doesn't seem to use the /etc/organization file or 
like allow the user to specify the organization header but instead uses 
the nntpservers organization line.  Is there a way around this or is pine 
v3.92 already out?  Thanks in advance!

First, from the main menu, hit 's' for setup, then hit 'c' for configure....
Then, check the 'enable-full-header-command' box, and it'll work from

anyway, heres how i sent the attachment...
the mail folder i wanted to send was called 'car'

I didn't have anything to do with it. Your posting to a newsgroup and
discussion list with thousands of people reading it. Only a handful of people
have *anything* to do with PINE.

In other words: Ask me if I care.

Really? I found that the program is pretty consistant with its commands. And
the two-line help bar at the bottom is of course an easy reference for what
commands are available, and one can always hit Control-G to get more detailed
help.

As I said, I could care less. You're trying to direct comments meant for a
handful of people to thousands. 

And you seem to be under the impression that the Pine group is some sort of
big corporate conglomerate. They're not. It's a bunch of geeks at UW that
happened to right a decent mail program and make it available for anyone
else who wants to use it... If you don't like it, that's fine. Delete it
and quit snivveling. It's not like it costs any money.

Let me guess, your just too computer illiterate and incompetant to understand
even the most simplistic of operations, and so your putting the blame for
your own basic stupidity on the people who wrote the program.

I've seen 12 year-old kids with no computer experience of any sort adapt to
using pine in less than 30 minutes. I can't imagine how basically mentally
challanged you must be to find the program so difficult to use...


Not to say that Pine doesn't have its critics, and that there aren't major
advocacy wars involving pine (for/against), but they all really boil down to
a matter of preference.

Subject: Subject: Merging Mail Folders??? and NOT deleting old "sent-mail" folders??
Date: 22 Jan 1996 05:20:03 GMT
Message-Id: <4dv6q3$lu7@nuke.csu.net>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Okay, I'm going to be moving all my mail files from one account to
another.  Problem is, the new account already has lots of mail folders
- many with the same names as the old account.  Is there a way to
"MERGE" the old mail files with the new ones?  If not through Pine,
can it be done with the unix cat command? (eg "cat oldfile newfile >
newmailfile") Or does a "folder" contain some header/footer
information that can't be tampered with?

Also, is there a way to get Pine NOT to ask to delete and rename the
old sent-mail folders?  I *always* want to keep them, so I'd rather
just have it do an automatic save.  Plus, I sometimes accidently
delete a few (by answering "n" or "y") when I'm performing a
type-ahead function since Pine takes a while to load.

Thanks for any help or information you can provide.

Dan

Using the pico editor in pine, is there a way to customize the
spell-checking database?  Among other things, I'm getting tired
of answering to my own last name.

Every other word processor I use has this capability.

I strongly suspect that your problem is not within Pine, but in the 
version of sendmail (the mail delivery system used on most UNIX 
computers) run on your system.

A security hole was uncovered in sendmail that led to the release of a 
revised version.  Most system administrators respond very quickly to 
security holes and installed the new version.

Unfortunately the new version of sendmail "broke" messages being sent to 
more than about 20 recipients.

When Pine tries to pass such a message to sendmail, sendmail crashes 
which Pine duly reports.

The problem was fixed in (if I recall correctly) sendmail 8.6.12.  
Unfortunately system managers are often not so prompt at installing new 
versions of software where security is not compromised in the old one :-)

You should contact your system manager and ask them to check that they 
are running sendmail 8.6.12 or later.

Cheers,

You can do this (and also see help about doing it!) in Pine's Setup 
Configuration screen.

*  Start Pine (version 3.91)
*  Type "S" (Setup) then "C" (Configuration)
*  Look down the list of options.

You can get help on any item by putting your cursor on it and typing "?"

The items you are particularly interested in are:

Saving copies of messages you send
----------------------------------
default-fcc		Set this to the name of the folder to store a copy
			of each message you send.

Keeping read mail elsewhere
---------------------------
read-message-folder	Set this to the name of the folder to store the
			messages you have read.
auto-move-read-msgs	Selecting this will let Pine automatically move
			your read mail to the above folder as you quit.
			If you don't set this option Pine will ask you
			whether you want to move the messages as you quit.

Finally a request... Please could you stop using ALL CAPITALS in messages 
you send out?  They are very hard to read, and capitals are usually 
reserved for "shouting" about things that annoy you (LIKE PEOPLE SENDING 
MESSAGES TYPED IN CAPITAL LETTERS! :-)

You are seeing a shortcoming of the standard UNIX "spell" utility.  Try 
investigating how to use GNU ispell instead.  You can set this up as the 
"alternate editor" and invoke it to check your document.  See the Pine 
Information Centre for details.

......heavens, and I thought pico was a "text editor", not a "word processor

The spell ckecking is not part of pico, but rather a call to whatever 
UNIX spell database is on your system.  If you tell us (me) what kind of 
system you're logging into, I can probably tell you how the spell program 
(usually ispell) can be updated.

Gerhard,
My remote diagnosis is the same: if you get a connection refused on port
143, it almost always means that the imapd is not correctly installed.
You can try telnetting to port 143 of the server to verify this.  If the
imapd is working, you'll be able to interact with it via telnet (if you
know the protocol syntax), or at least be able to see that it's alive.

David, you are a model of discretion!  Don't think that, because we
don't write too often, there aren't oodles (we'll leave exact numbers
out here) of very happy users of Pine.  Pine has been a godsend for
many, many people, both systems administrators and users.

Of course, not everyone loves all aspects of Pine!  Many, many
compromises had to be made in its design, and I particlulary applaud
the developers for writing a document that describes the design
decisions in detail (rather than just stating a vague "design goal" and
leaving it at that).  The choices are hard, and not everyone will agree
with all the decisions that were made along the way, but the overall
set of features is well balanced.

Kudos to the Pine development team for a well-done, and necessary
product!

Please also let me know about this software (ie URL).
Has anyone tried Win-SMTP 32 bit version.  I use the 16-bit win 3.x ver & it's 
OK for LAN use but a bit tricky for dial-up internet mail (I use the latter).

Hi you Pine-users,

I have a problem with the general variable "standard-printer". The
general configuration file (pine.conf) defines the standard-printer
variable, but the specified value does not show up in position 2 when go
in "Main-menu->Setup->Printer", instead I read "lpr" (and this does not
correspond to the value of the environmental variable PRINTER !)
I am running version 3.91 of Pine and I have the impression that under an
earlier version the standard-printer variable was used as expected.

Can somebody help me ?

Jean

Yes, once. One of my users, who uses WinPine client with a Sun4 server, 
experienced this. The effect was completely repeatable (so timing effects 
did not apply). I could see no message specific peculiarities.

Egil,
I'm concerned about a statement you make below in your msg of 7 January:
"RFC1340 clearly indicates the possibility of sending straight 8bit."

I believe this is at best misleading, if not incorrect.  (NB: "RFC1340" is
presumably a typo, but note that 1341 is superseded by 1521.)

MIME provides a method for labeling and encoding content.  It does *not*
specify what is legal to send via any given transport.  What's legal to
*send* is defined by RFC821 and its successors.  With the current Internet
mail transport infrastructure, it is not sufficient simply to "announce"
8bit in the header; indeed, as far as I know, there is no Internet
standard *anywhere* that says it's OK to send unencoded 8bit (much less,
binary) data *unless* by explicit negotiation with the MTA via the
8BITMIME extension to (E)SMTP defined in RFC-1426.

Here's the relevant text from the MIME standard:

 NOTE: The distinction between the Content-Transfer-Encoding values
      of "binary", "8bit", etc.  may seem unimportant, in that all of
      them really mean "none" -- that is, there has been no encoding of
      the data for transport.  However, clear labeling will be of
      enormous value to gateways between future mail transport systems
      with differing capabilities in transporting data that do not meet
      the restrictions of RFC 821 transport.

      Mail transport for unencoded 8-bit data is defined in RFC-1426
      [RFC-1426].  As of the publication of this document, there are no
      standardized Internet mail transports for which it is legitimate
      to include unencoded binary data in mail bodies.  Thus there are
      no circumstances in which the "binary" Content-Transfer-Encoding
      is actually legal on the Internet.  However, in the event that
      binary mail transport becomes a reality in Internet mail, or when
      this document is used in conjunction with any other binary-capable
      transport mechanism, binary bodies should be labeled as such using
      this mechanism.

Because we take some pride in Pine's adherence to Internet standards, it
is always painful to see folks distributing patches, such as your
"just-send-8" patch, which cause Pine to *violate* Internet standards.
This is not to say that I *like* the limitations of 821, only that we
are committed to interoperability via Internet standards adherence.
As you know, Pine 3.92 will support ESMTP negotiation of 8BITMIME
transport, which is the standards-based solution to the problem.

    The "Pine Technical Notes" for version 3.91 (October 1994), beginning 
on page 28, discuss configuration.  A system administrator can set up a 
system-wide *fixed* configuration file for at least some variables which 
users cannot override.  It might go in a file such as 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed .  Sorry, I don't have the ftp URL where 
the Technical Notes can be obtained.  (An administrator can also set up 
a system-wide configuration file which users *can* override.)

    You can use the Alt-Edit command to configure the spell checker of 
your choice.  I use ispell on my Amiga based Pine.

Go into Setup, Config.  Make sure you have the following set:

default-fcc            = <No Value Set: using "sent-mail"

or the value there is an existing folder you want copies of your messages
saved to.

In Pine's Main Menu, hit s for setup and choose Config.
The first two lines in the config menu are for 'Personal Name' 
(fingername equivalent) and 'user domain' (server name).  Modifying these 
two fields will create an alias (read: fake) address.
What I'd suggest is that you check with your provider or sysadmins before 
you do this.  Here, it's considered illegal to use a 'fraudulent' email 
address and is grounds for the user getting their account suspended.

Be careful.

Lea

To post, you should use the Rich Headers option. It adds "Newsgroups:" as 
a header. Put the name of the newsgroup there and compose your message 
normally. I don't read news in Pine. I prefer Tin.

You can read about this by:

1.  Starting Pine (always helpful! :-)
2.  Selecting Setup ("S" from the Main Menu)
3.  Selecting Configuration (C)
4.  Looking down the list of options and seeing, a few lines down the very
    first screen the magical words "signature-file".
5.  Notice that the command menu at the bottom of the screen talles you that
    the "?" will give you help (on the item the cursor is on).

If you have a look there you'll probably find all you want to know (and 
may spot some other interesting things in passing, too).

Cheers,

As I recall this is due to a small problem in the C-Client code 
distributed with Pine 3.91.  The problem arises because the problem 
message includes crom CR-LF pairs.  Pine sees the total number of 
characters (including LF's), tries to save the message, but omits the 
LF's.  This causes the total message size to shrink (LF's stripped out) 
and is detected by Pine's sanity checking code.

The solution is to obtain and use the later IMAP kit from 
ftp.cac.wachington.edu.  (I think it's imap-3.6beta? ... can't remember, 
but it should be obvious).  This includes new C-cline and imapd code 
which (I think!) cures the problem.

Cheers,

If you know ahead of time which messages you need to incorporate into your
text, you could save (export) them to your shell and then use the "Read
File"  Command to insert them as you compose. You could also edit them
either in the shell prior to using them, or after you insert them into
your message text.

I dont see this. With our setup, it simply skips groups with no new news 
until it finds one with something to display. No beeps.

    Assuming you are using the current version 3.91 of Pine, go into 
Setup and Config from the Main Menu.  Scroll down and add a 
customized-header  Return-receipt-to: your-email-address
Be aware, however, that this does not guarnatee that you will get a 
return receipt, as not all receiving systems honor it, and there is 
currently (so far as I know) no Internet-wide requirement that the 
request be honored.

If the mail folders are the default berkeley format there is no problem 
in concatenating the files. Alternatively systematically rename one set 
as old.folders, say,  and then use Pine's features to merge the contents.

No problem.  Look for a line containing 

last-time-prune-questioned=yy.mm

in the pinerc file. 

Change yy.mm to something in the distant future (999.12 should work, I 
think). Bingo.
This must be done by an editor, as pine's config will not touch this field.
I dont know what will happen in the year 2000!

There are 2.5 mail server I looked at:
Post.office found at http://www.software.com/
NTmail found at http://www.net-shopper.co.uk/software/ntmail/
SLmail95 found at http://www.seattlelab.com/

My favorite is post office, but I bought slmail95 that run on NT (not as 
service). The upgrade will be available for free in March. I run an intranet
with NT and website. SLmail does everything I need and there is a big price 
difference. So far so good

Hello,
sorry if it was answered before - I'm new to this group.
I need to convert mail files which were individually stored by Minuet into Pine
"folder" file. I noticed each Pine message start with :
	from user@domain DATE
	Status: RO
	X-Status:
	Return-Path:
and the rest of the header seems always ordered the same way. 
Minuet mail file begins with the path the mail followed : 
	Received from x@y by ...
	Date: ...
How could I automagically convert my old mail files, setting the correct Pine
header ?
Many thanks in advance

Without recompiling pine, the user cannot modify the from line.

But modifying the from line would not really achive anonymity.
To send mail anonymously you should use an anonymous remailer.
I don't really know the details, but you can go to

All pine configuration information that you do not wish to
be changable by users should go into (for Unix versions)
/usr/local/pine.conf-fixed, there is something similar for
the VMS versions.  For DOS, I don't think the concept really
makes sense.

Note that all you can do with this is prevent users from accidently
using certain things.  A determined user can always recompile
a version of pine for herself that by-passes the -fixed files.

   How do I have pine show a list of folders in

   I've tried various "Goto Folder" commands, and have tried to make sense
   of the online help available from the Folder List screen.  So far, I and
   a number of other people have been unsuccessful in doing what would seem
   to be a relatively simple task.

   All that I would like to do is show pine folders in another directory
   that is not a subdirectory of ~/mail.  (I'm able to open individual 
   files in other directories, if I know the name in advance.  That is not
   what I'm trying to ultimately accomplish, however.)

Pine does not really have a file browser, if that's what you seek.
However, there are ways to accomplish related tasks in conjunction with
pine:

1. Just Ctrl-Z out of pine and perform a directory listing from the
   shell prompt.  This requires having set pine's enable-suspend
   feature.

2. Create a pine folder-collection that comprises the directory you have
   in mind.  For instance, I use (an expanded version of)

	folder-collections=home_directory       []

   Selecting List from the Main Menu then gives the opportunity to list
   the file (folders, in pine's view) in the home_directory collection.

3. Often pine's enable-tab-completion feature can be utilized to
   construct part or all of a partially known filename.

Hope this helps,

A quick and incomplete solution would be to chown (change owner) of
.pinerc so that it is owned by root with permissions -rw-r--r--

(or set up a symbolic link to some such file).

Hope that helps.

   I also have problems when people post news using MIME.  My answer

One convoluted possibility is to save the attachment to a file using
pine, if necessary apply an external MIME decoder such as munpack

    I just installed PC-Pine and sent a message, I noticed that the 
return address on the message (as sent) was garbled:

    I set the account to rosully, and the domain to aww.com, in the

I see that you can now bounce, ie redirect with the same From: line, mail

moderate, keeping the same From: line so it doesn't look like everything 
in the newsgroup came from me, and add an Approved: line while I'm at it.
Any ideas? (If you try using the bounce command you'll see what I mean)

Subject: Having PINE access subdirectories other than ~/mail

Message-Id: <4e1n27$2qh@cegt201.bradley.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Our university recently decided to support the Pine mailer here on campus,
much to the combined delight and dismay of many people.  I'm one of the
student consultants here, and I am asked to support this mailer.  I have
little experience with Pine/Pico, as I prefer to use Elm/Vi.

Mailer preferences aside, I've run into a question for which I'm unable
to come with an answer:  How do I have pine show a list of folders in
another directory (other than ~/mail, which is the current default)?

I've tried various "Goto Folder" commands, and have tried to make sense
of the online help available from the Folder List screen.  So far, I and
a number of other people have been unsuccessful in doing what would seem
to be a relatively simple task.

All that I would like to do is show pine folders in another directory
that is not a subdirectory of ~/mail.  (I'm able to open individual 
files in other directories, if I know the name in advance.  That is not
what I'm trying to ultimately accomplish, however.)

(Note:  I do not speak for my school, my employer, or anybody else for
that matter.  Thanks.)

    You are correct.  If you get a return receipt back at all, it means 
nothing more than that the receiving system got it.  You get no 
information about when, if ever, the destined recipient opened the mail.  
There are a few proprietary email systems that do provide this 
mail-opened type of receipt, but they are external to the Internet as 
such.  So far as I now at present, there is no way to enforce a 
mail-opened receipt.

Just create a signature file. Then set it in Setup/Config/signature-file 
and set Setup/Config/signature-at-bottom.

Hello *!

I use Pine for mail and news.
My link to the Internet is via uucp / uux.
Unfortunately Pine refuses to post articles via uux.
I don't have defined an NNTP-server since I don't need one,
but Pine insists on it.
Is there a magic configuration trick to post articles via uux?

System: Intel-PC, Linux 1.2.12, smail, Pine 3.91.
Mail RX and TX and news RX work fine.

Thanks a lot for any help!
Detlef.

PS: Due to the above problems this article got posted by
a colleague. Please reply to dema@astrax.hanse.de. Thanks!

I'm not sure, but if you have access to the WWW, check out URL:

http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/pine/user-guide/index.html

It has links to many categories of functionality.

Subject: Can I use Pine on a UUCP link?.
Status: O
X-Status: 

Hi
 
I have a two-tier service with my ISP, UUCP and TCP/IP, but I wish
to get Pine running on my UUCP link.

At the moment I am setting up elm and tin which I know can be used
on the UUCP link from someone else with my ISP. The only thing is
that I prefer Pine for email - from my uni days :).

Type: pico press enter

Type: .signature press enter
Edit: your filename (.signature)
Type: ^X (control + x)
Save it as filename .signature

that's:   dot s i g n a t u r e

The signature is a normal text file. It is the file .signature in your
HOME-directory or the file listed in setup:signature-file

Anybody use Pine with an intermittent PPP/SLIP connection?  I'm having

and I was wondering if anybody out there could help me troubleshoot.

Thanks in advance.

It's my understanding - ie, correct me if I'm wrong - that the
Return-receipt-to will only return when the destination machine receives the
mail, not when it is actually read by the recipient.  I don't know of any
current means to do such.

   I'd like to know what the limit is as to how many people you can put
   into the "To:" line, as well as the "cc:" line and "Bcc:" line.  I've
   had trouble sending to over 25 or so people at a time per line, but
   haven't been able to figure out a precise limit.  I couldn't find
   anything in the man pages about it.  What do you know?  Or is this a
   "sendmail" total limit, and if so what is the total limit?  Does it
   matter how one divides the names between those three "send" lines?

As I recall there was indeed a version of sendmail, perhaps around
8.6.9, with a bug that caused this problem.  The fix is to upgrade
sendmail.

Nope; but you could ask your correspondent to reply in order to confirm
receipt.

The closest to what you describe is the Return-Receipt header described
in other posts.  Note that this (if you get one) confirms _delivery_ on
the remote system, rather than having been accessed by the recipient.

Hi:
We have unixware 2.01 which is SCO compatible.  Any hints on how I can 
get a working copy of pine to work on our Unixware 2.01 Server.  The 
machine hardware is an HP, LM Pentium Server with SCSI hard disks.  
Thanks. Jeff Gordon.

I posted this message two weeks ago without getting replies. Sorry for 
the repetition, but I think the subject is important enough.

Our site maintains a software repository available on all Unix 
workstations under the /usr/local hierarchy. This obviously includes 
pine and a global mailcap file, so I have been asked to modify pine 
in such a way that it reads the mailcap file from /usr/local/etc 
(which is under site control) rather than /etc (which under the sysadm
control).

I have then found the following lines in mailcap.c:

[...]
/*
 * We've decided not to implement the RFC1524 standard minimum path, because
 * some of us think it is harder to debug a problem when you may be misled
 * into looking at the wrong mailcap entry.
 */
#ifdef DOS
#define MC_PATH_SEPARATOR ';'
#else /* !DOS */
#define MC_PATH_SEPARATOR ':'
#define MC_STDPATH         ".mailcap:/etc/mailcap"
#endif /* !DOS */
[...]

and this in RFC1524:

   [...]
   For UNIX, a path search of mailcap files is specified.  The default
   path search is specified as including at least the following:
 
   $HOME/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap
   [...]

Is it possible that in the coming version of pine "some of you" are 
going to reconsider the RFC1524 standard minimum path?

override the default path.  I don't forsee going beyond that in future
releases...

The amount of time seems to depend on how quickly the NNTP server
makes the connection.  On days when my remote NNTP server is slow,
it takes a while for the connection to be made.  It looks like
Pine will sit there until 1) it gets a connection or 2) it gets an
error message.

I have a client with a list of 300+ addresses, not in Pine addressbook 
format, that he wants to send a single message to.  In addition, he wants 
the list to be in blind-carbon format so that recipients do not have to 
wade through screenfuls of addresses before getting to the message.  The 
list, as it's formatted right now, would probably work fine if I could 
get it into the Bcc: field, but I haven't yet successfully done that...
Is there a way to read a file in to a Compose header field, and if so, 
how do you do that?  
Because of the size of the list editting would probably be almost as bad 
as entering the addresses individually into the addressbook (this is NOT 
a user who could ably use something like vi or emacs).
Any ideas gratefully accepted...

Could someone tell me if it is possible to customize user-name in the
"From: " field ?  I know I can reset personal-name and user-domain,
but .pinerc does not let me change the user name.  so the "From: "
field will end up with something like:
	"Customized Personal-name" user-name@Customized.User-domain.edu
				   ^^^^^^^^^
I would like to be able to set customized user-name too.

Here is why I want to do this:

I am travelling to a place where I have to borrow an account.  I
cannot telnet to my own host because the delay and loss rate are
intolerable.  I want to send email to people and hope they reply or
email to my own account.


I know I can fix it in the "Reply To:" header field, but what if they
use mail instead of reply?

I also understand this will allow forging emails, but this is exactly
what netscape it configured to do, right?  People don't have to use
pine to forge mails.


thanks very much for your help.

But how about when the news spool is empty; i.e., if you go to that news
group, and then hit & for unexclude, Pine will tell you "No messages to
unexclude"? Is this what you meant? It's different from when there are simply
no *unread* messages in that news group.

	Just to add an extra wrinkle to this thread. 

	When you request a return-receipt (also called "delivery notification)
you may get the DN but it might not come from the end user's system.  Some
people do not use SMTP based mail systems or mail systems using sendmail.
In some cases there are "gateways" between these other email systems.  In
some cases these gateways are "smart".  They are aware that one side supports
DNs but the other side does not.  So, for messages passing through the 
gateway they will generate a DN for those messages with requests attached.
In some cases the mail may not have been delivered.  Yet, you are left
with a false sense that it has.

Hi:
You must: 
1)  make and edit a file called ".forward" in your home directory;
2)  put the COMPLETE Internet address of the receiving person
    on one line in your new .forward file;
3)  you may put as many forwarding addresses as you wish into 
    your .forward file;  BUT ONLY ONE ADDRESS PER LINE!
4)  the incoming message will also go into one of your own 
    Pine folders, depending on if/how you are using the Unix
    filter()  function.       q.v.   ;-)
5)  if you're not using the filter()  function, then the incoming mail
    will go into your INBOX folder (provided that you have not changed 
    the INBOX folder as the destination folder for un-filtered 
    incoming mail).

I think you are using PMDF's Pine, you should make sure you have the 
latest version because some bugs in this area had been fixed.
ask your system manager to contact service@innosoft.com to get a new version.

Is there a way to use wild cards when subscribing or unsubscribing from 
Usenet newsgroups from within Pine?  Or do you need to do it

Using Pine 3.91, can I specify a list of newsgroups for posting? I'd like 
an abbreviated way of doing this rather than selecting each newsgroup 
each time.

Email appreciated.

I just downloaded 'pine3.91.tar.Z' from ftp.cac.washington.edu, and I
uncompressed it and I "tar"-ed it.  So, all the files are out in the open,
but I can't find any files that mention HPUX 9.0 or 10.0- and we're using
10.0 at the school where I work.  I don't know what argument to apply to
the 'build' command.  The closest makefiles I found are for HP/UX 8.0
(called 'makefile.hpp').  I am worried that this 8.0 version of HP/UX
might be too different for me to be able to use the corresponding
makefiles to build our 'pine' application from the cource code.

I know we also have the option of downloading the binaries, but that
scares me even more AND moreover, it would take ANOTHER three hours!  So,
that's too much of a gamble if there's an easy answer.

Can anyone offer advice, or a makefile, for HP/UX 10.0 'pine
building'????  I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

Nope ... cannot be done ... see paul bartlett's (sp?) response.  Hell, if 
you want a return reciept guaranteeing that the recipient acually got 
your message, the US Post Office will sell you that for 3 or 4 dollars, 
but I don't think they actually watch to see if he (she) actually opened 
it.  Hhmmmm ... maybe a new idea ... certified mail (proves you sent it 
... well actually not, it proves you sent something) ... return reciept 
requested (someone got it) ... deliver only to addressee (he/she got the 
envelope, not sure what's in it though) ... UUhhhh ... wait ... open it 
and read it (you can read, correct?) ... sign here ... wait, wait, wait, 
... did you understand it?? ... sign here ... What, you don't can't sign 
your name because you're reading someone else's (e)mail ... Damn, where 
are the internet police when we need them.  I want PINE to assure me that 
not only did you recieve my mail, but you opened it, understood it, and 
will reply to me before 10 a.m. yesterday.   G'Day.

Hi

The simple answer to the "Receipt" function is that the "server" you are 
sending the message to lets you know "it" received the message.

This, I found out, does not necessarily mean that the person you are 
sending the message to actually "read" it (which is why I decided to try 
this feature).  I have since disabled the feature because the Post Office 
will automatically let me know when a message is not delivered.  Why 
duplicate the effort?!

I had the same experience when I tried to conpile for my Linux box.
Accidentally, however, I looked at a patch-file (to allow 8-bit mail
and news in addition to MIME), and there I discovered that the
arguments were listed in one of the source files.

So if you go to the source directory, and do a "grep lnx *.c" you'll
find in which file they are listed.

Good luck.

Yup, Marsha, I know that ... my post was a (stupid?) tounge-in-cheek 
response to a guy who wanted to know if someone had actually read his 
email, and I wuz only trying to point out that that is impossible. BYE.

Two problems with Pine folders:
1. I would like to look at my files on our remote server.
There is a folder collection below my inbox which says
"Select here to expand" but nothing happens when I hit
"V" for select or when I arrow down to that position and
hit return.  Can I configure Pine so this will be possible?
2. My boss has no news group folder collection on his Pine
L screen (folder screen).  Similarly, it says select here
to expand, but nothing happens.  What does he need to do
to be able to read news groups from Pine?

I have a bloated Pine mail box would like to simply transfer the old mail

program REFUSES to load unless the PC/TCP module is loaded (TSR?). Is 
there a way to force DOS Pine to run or is there such a module that I can

Now imagine that you are one of the vast number of mail recipients not
having QP support, and you receive mail written in any of the many
languages that require ISO-8859 characters. I have excluded QP info in
the header to illustrate the impression this makes on the reader. I
hope you will now understand the essence of the rationale behind
RFC1428:
	This existing functionality is reduced by conversion	     
	from 8bit text to text encoded in unreadable Base-64
	or "garbled" text encoded in quoted printable.

I think that you will agree that such a message as shown in my example
is really more or less completely garbled from the recipients point of 
view, indeed "Quoted Unreadable" :-).

But there are many indications from RFCs that such a practice is
indeed commonplace. And RFC1428 "Transition of Internet Mail from
Just-Send-8 to 8Bit-SMTP/MIME" clearly discuss the problems generated
by uncritical use of MIME QP. 

And as mentioned in RFC1428, ISO-8859 8 bit messages having been
subjected to 7 bit stripping is usually more readable that QP-ed
messages anyway.

To warn against such problems, the help message for the new
"allow-8bit-mail" feature reads:				     
	This feature controls the manner in which outgoing email messages
	containing characters outside the (7bit) US-ASCII set are coded.
	...
	Regretfully, all email agents are not yet 8 bit clean. Consequently,
	depending on the path email travels, one runs a certain risk that
	8 bit characters will become corrupted if this feature is enabled.

Please read the text carefully. It says "binary", not "8bit". There
is a big difference. I've *never* said that "binary" coding should be
attempted! 8bit coding involves handling of message regarded as text,
which includes adherence to line length restrictions. As an extra 
precaution against problems by upper bit stripping, I have not allowed 
characters in the range 80-9F, plus FF.

I *do* understand that you take pride in Pine. It is a very good mail
reader, and additionally the source code is very clearly and orderly
piece of software. That is why I use it myself.

If I have caused pain, I deeply apologize. That was not intentional.
I hope I have shown that I have taken precautions to keep this as
conforming to current standards and practice as possible. 

Please also consider that Pine's use of Mime QP on Usenet is considered
a definitive violation. Plus the fact that Pine violates RFC1036 in the
way signatures are handled. And from my experience, sending Mime QP in 
email is an impolite thing to do, if not a violation. My patch tries
to correct these things.

Luckily, 8 bit restrictions are now practically out of the way with
respect to news. I hope that we can soon come in a position where
they will be removed in mail too, and finally also in header subject
lines and the like.

But why do you want to exclude all those who do not use the Pine SMTP
server? Why on earth shouldn't at least the sysadmin allow Pine to  
understand that "ESMTP is spoken here"?

A final point: In that we agree that 8bit mail is a Good Thing, how
on earth can we ensure that it will be implemented unless we start
using it. Many sysadmins will not start converting their sendmail
"O7True" settings to "O7False" without a certain degree of pressure
put on them.

I challenge you to find *any* Internet standard that says it's OK to
"just-send-8" in email.  I can't be responsible for other's violations of
the standards, so "commonplace" doesn't cut it.  (News is different; we
agree that Pine should support just-send-8 for News, and it will --even
though some in the community hold that this would be a mistake.)

The issue is not that QP is wonderful, it is that unencoded 8bit is
illegal, except by explicit negotiation.

Absolutely!  And if your patch was to provide an option for stripping the
8th bit rather than "just-send-8", I would have no objection; indeed, we
might have adopted it.

I have read the text carefully, and if you do the same, I'm sure you'll
conclude that the *next* paragraph cited makes it clear that the only
legitimate way to send 8bit in the current Internet email infrastructure
is via the 8BITMIME extension defined in RFC-1426.

> Plus the fact that Pine violates RFC1036 in the

Are you saying that you are unable to create a .signature file that is
1036 compliant?  It's true that Pine doesn't *enforce* any particular
signature discipline, but I think it is misleading to say it violates the
standard when it is perfectly possible for you to configure it to comply.
But this is *way* off topic.

It may be impolite, but it is certainly not a violation.  And sympathy for
recipients who in 1996 still don't have MIME-capable mail readers (which
makes the QP encoding invisible to the user) must be limited, since there
are so many MIME-aware tools freely available.  (Ironically, later in your
message you argue that people won't change without some pressure to do
so!)

> My patch tries to correct these things.

It does so by making our mailer violate Internet standards.  This is not
helpful.  If you don't like the standards, participate in the IETF and get
them changed.  Again, if the patch was to strip the 8th bit to avoid QP,
or to support the 8BITMIME extension, there would be no argument.

I would prefer this world, too, but it is not the one we live in.

I don't understand what you're saying.  I don't know what a "Pine SMTP
server" is; Pine works with any SMTP server, and in the future it will
take advantage of at least one ESMTP extension:  Pine 3.92 will indeed
allow the sysadmin to say "ESMTP is spoken here", via the option to
negotiate 8BITMIME.

Orderly migration is the IETF strategy, and that's what ESMTP and 8BITMIME
are all about.

It comes down to this:  You've decided that the world will be a better
place if the Internet standards are ignored and we all "just-send-8".
Although I'm sympathetic to the goal, (as previously stated) we are
committed to interoperability via Internet standards, so cannot endorse
your means to that end.

I'm sure we could continue this debate indefinitely, but let's just agree
to disagree.

I can't tell where to send submissions to your pine-info mailing list:
it's not in any of your introductory information!  But anyway, I hope this
letter makes it to the list...  :)

I just downloaded 'pine3.91.tar.Z' from ftp.cac.washington.edu, and I
uncompressed it and I "tar"-ed it.  So, all the files are out in the open,
but I can't find any files that mention HPUX 9.0 or 10.0- and we're using
10.0 at the school where I work.  I don't know what argument to apply to
the 'build' command.  The closest makefiles I found are for HP/UX 8.0
(called 'makefile.hpp').  I am worried that this 8.0 version of HP/UX
might be too different for me to be able to use the corresponding
makefiles to build our 'pine' application from that source code.

I also did a grep on my directories for HP, and hp but niether produced any
useful output other than what I've already stated.

I know we also have the option of downloading the binaries, but that
scares me even more, because that's where differences in systems really
show up- right?  Moreover, it would take ANOTHER three hours to download
those to our HP9000!  So, that's too much of a gamble, esp. if there's an
easy/easier answer.

SO, can anyone offer advice, or a makefile, for HP/UX 10.0 'pine
building'????  I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

I am not sure which way round you are asking this! I see no problems with 
newsgroups where there are messages but I have previously seen them all. 
It is not so easy to experiment with empty newsgroups as I dont seem to

    To the best of my knowledge, there is *NO* way currently throughout 
the Internet to force getting a receipt when and only when the recipient 
opens the mail.  Some proprietary email systems will provide such a 
receipt, but only within those systems themselves.  As someone pointed 
out to me in an email, even the delivery receipt is no guarantee that the 
mail got to the final destination system, as some intermediate "smart" 
gateways will generate a receipt.  Unfortunately, the delivery receipt 
remains an "iffy" situation at best.

That indicates that the message is addressed specifically to you. Without 
that, it's probably a cc: or something similar. Hope this helps!

As far as I know there is no such thing. VMS/MAIL file is index sequential
(with pointers to text files of the larger messages).
  If you have there a free C programmer he/she can use the MAIL$ routines
(available from VMS-5.4 or something alike) to read the messages one by one and
write them in Unix file format. I do not know the Unix mail file format, but I
guess it shouldn't be too hard to write something like that.

You just have to setup a folder collection spec for the directory of
interest, e.g. one for the directory Elm uses (~/Mail) would look like:

folder-collections= {some-imap-host.bradley.edu}Mail/[*]

You can have as many folder collections as you want.
Omit the stuff in curly braces if you're not using IMAP.

Note that if you do this on a system-wide basis, (in the pine.conf
file) you need the patch to 3.91 that has been previously posted to
correct an initialization bug.

Greetings!

Has anyone had a chance to port Pine 3.91 to MachTen 4.0.2 (PPC) ? I just 
got my 4.0.2 and tried the port myself and ran into problems with L_SET 
and W_OK in the c-client.

Thanks!


Michael

You can either set up the configuration of PINE to create separate
folders for *EVERY* outgoing message (probably not a good idea unless
managed by some PERL scripts) or something really neat....

Add your most common recipients to your address book.  Then go back to Edit
that entry; I believe you can select F (Fcc) and specify a fully-qualified
path to the file where you will store that copy.  I've done it with one
person and it works great!  To be on the safe side, type the address book
alias which generates the proper address to be sure that the letter is saved
to the right place.

Has anyone sent a letter to multiple addresses with personal Fcc's?
Did the letter get copied to each file?

Think of yourself walking to your front door in the morning and picking 
up the envelopes, opening them, and reading their contents.  This is what 
Pine lets you do: read messages *after* they have been delivered to your 
electronic mail address.

Now think of yourself going away on holiday for some months :-).  You 
would want to ask the postman delivering your letters to "do something" 
with them.  This may involve throwing them away(! - so you could open the 
front door when you got back?), delivering them to a friand's address, or 
(if they were Truly Wonderful) pushing the letters through your door but 
also sending a note back to the sender warning them it might be some time 
before they get a reply.

What I'm trying to say is that you need to intercept the mail *delivery* 
mechanism in this case; by the time they have been delivered and Pine can 
get to the messages it is too late.

So what you need to do is ask at your local Help Desk or Support Centre 
how to do this.  If you are using a UNIX computer it will almost 
certainly involve two steps:

1.  Set up a filter program to look at arriving messages to determine who the
    sender is and construct a reply to send back.  On most UNIX systems one
    of these is already available called "vacation".  You can read about it
    and how to use it by giving the "man vacation" command.

2.  You then need to persuade the e-mail delivery system to deliver an
    arriving message into your mailbox AND pass a copy to "vacation" (or 
    whatever filter program you use).  This is done by creating a file in
    your home directory called ".forward" with appropriate contents.

If you have "vacation" on your computers its manual page should give you 
step by step instructions on how to set all this up.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Pine cannot do it, but you can use a mailfilter for this 
(eg procmail). (I use a .mailfilter as we run PP)

Hello all,

I have a situation here with PICO (version 3.91) and resizing x-windows.

The pine-3.91 version of pico dies if you resize the xterm on both AIX =
V32 and=20
AIX V41.  But the pine-3.89 version of pico does not have this problem.  =
=20

Can anyone else duplicate this problem?  Is this a known bug?  Is there =
a=20
solution/fix to this problem?

NOTE: (I can also duplicate this problem on Solaris 2.5 by resizing the =
dtterm=20
windows.)


Any help or info would be greatly appreciated.

    Pine will not do this for you.  You have to employ some agent which 
will process the incoming mail and still leave a copy in your mailbox.  
You did not say what operating system you are using Pine with, so there 
is no single answer to your question.  If you are on some type of Unix 
system, there is a program called 'vacation' which you may be able to 
use.  Some people use a more elaborate program called 'procmail'.

    While using Pine for extended periods, I receive this message:

         Unable to create TCP socket: Too many open files

    This occurs when I've opened and closed many newsgroups and sent / 
received several mail messages.  I run Pine 24 hours a day.

    Since AmigaDOS places no limits on the number of open files, I believe
Pine must have a MAX_FILES limit.  Does Pine properly close files streams
that it has opened?  Is this an issue for 3.92?

    If I quit and resume Pine, then all is well.

The following applies to PC-Pine 3.91, as well as 3.89.

I just went through this after installing PC-Pine for Winsock on a PC with 
Windows 95--Windows 95 has timezone specification built in, but Pine doesn't 
recognise it.  The only information I have found on timezones is in the Pine 
technical notes, which you can read at http://www.washington.edu/pine.

You have to set the timezone using the DOS command

  set TZ=EST [or whatever]

I have included this command in my AUTOEXEC.BAT file (I suppose it would also 
be possible to start Pine from a batch file that included the timezone 
setting).

Minor nit: 'illegal' and 'legitimate' are orthogonal to 'RFC-conforming'.

On second thoughts, make that 'Major nit'.  Too many people confuse
between RFC conformance and various other qualities such as legality,
legitimacy, usefulness, validity, workability, interoperability, and
user-friendliness.  They forget that RFC conformance is a means to an
end, not the end.

Hello

	I have installed pine on a Sun Sparc Station 20 running 
solaris 2.3. I have installed in in my account only. In the 
configuration I have named smtp-server as different machine, lets 
call it B. B is a relay host. On my machine ( lets call it A) I 
receive mail by invoking 'mail' at the $ prompt. But I dont see 
any mail while in pine. However, through pine I can send mail 
anywhere. It looks like that the INBOX of pine is not somehow 
connected with sendmail of my machine A. 
	What I mean is that I can send mail out using pine but 
can not receive mail using pine. But I have no problem sending or 
receiving mail using the default mailler of Solaris 'sendmail'.

	I would appreciate any idea or pointer.

Thank you

When I send mail via pine, it only puts username@machine-name in

How do I get pine to put the FQDN in the return address.  People

You can have pine change the FROM line as a customized header IF that 
functionality is compiled into pine.  The file you need to change is: 

pine3.91/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h

Just change the flag ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and recompile.

I am using pine in a unix shell account.  I want to configure a Reply 
to line that gives user@domain.  When I do, it looks fine on the fcc, 
but shows up at the other end as user@NODE.domain.  The only varition 
I have seen on this is that if I specify the smtp server 
(node.domain) explicitly in the pine setup it comes across as 
user@node.domain (lowercase).  Is there a work around for this?  I've 
tried adding a \ to the user@domain with the same result.

Some time ago I read that the Pine e-mail system has a "receipt" function 
by which a system-generated message is automatically sent back to the 
sender when the e-mail in question is "opened". If this function is 
available, how would I find or use it? Any help would be most appreciated 
as I am a novice user of the Pine system.

Thank you,

I don't think I quite understand.  You want a text editor that can't
speak to the filesystem, as it were?  Just something for people to type in?  
For a class or somehting?  I prob. misunderstood, but that's what I assume
below.

I don't have the pico source handy, but what you might do is:
1.  Make it suid to user nobody (you do have root access for this, right?)
    and do the suid in the initialization code.  The problem would be that
    you could still read/write world accessible files.
2.  Find the file reading/writing code.  Maybe whenever a file is opened
    for reading/writing you could instead open /dev/null?

Hello,
	I'm currently using a Web-based form to send an email to 
any user on the net. The problem is that the form does not perform 
any email certification or authentication. Hence some of the mail 
sent from this Web form is bounced and ends up in the mail of 
webster as the web server is running from the webster account. Is 
there any way such that a bounce main will bounce to the person on 
the 'reply-to' address?? I understand that we can choose to use the 
'Reply-To' address when replying our email.


Just Me,
Aaron Aw

it possible to configure pine to operate as an offline reader ?

i need it to:

a) collect all incoming messages from my server, store them locally and
   mark them deleted on the server.

b) allow me to compose messages offline and upload them either the next
   time i connect or on demand.

is this possible, or am i dreaming ?

Pine does not yet support either offline or disconnected operation.
It's planned for the future, though.

Hi,

I'm using pine 3.91 and get a lot of mail in which the message text
is attached as part 1.0 1.1 ...

When doing a reply I can't get pine to include these parts. I would 
like to comment on the text in these parts and not as a separate
message.

Have I missed some configuration feature or isn't this possible ?
(I'm aware that I can save the attachments and then include them
in my reply but that seems unnecessary complicated)


Regards
-Ken

I have asked this before, but it didn't work.  I have a 486 SX 25 laptop
computer running Word version 1.0 in Windows 3.1.  I access my internet
server, which has a UNIX shell and runs PINE 3.89.  I am trying to download
a message I have saved in a PINE folder to my floppy disk.  I know I need to
get the message into UNIX, but I am unsure about which directory and how to
access the directory when I leave PINE for the UNIX shell.  From there, I
need to download to Word on my laptop; but I don't know how to do that
either.  

Could someone please lead me by the hand, step by step, in this process. 
Once I figure it out, I won't need further help, but it is frustrating.

Thanks to all who have helped me before.h

Hi Brian

The receipt feature is available in Pine but it only tells you that the 
Internet Provider received the mail, not that the person you sent it to 
has read it.  I tried it for awhile but decided it was a waste of time.  
You will know if they didn't receive it because the Post Office takes 
care of that.

If, however, you still want it, it is in the Config. menu of Setup.

this??  Could the fact that I'm in read-only mode ("pine -o") affect this at
all?  (I use this mode because I don't want to change my inbox at all when
using Pine - I download my mail via POP at a later time...)

You can run Yehavi's VMS PINE client and connect to a unix IMAPD
and send the folder contents over the net.  I do that now and
again, although I hadn't tried moving the contents of entire 
folders in that way. I think it should work.

Conversely you ought to be able to run Yehavi's port of IMAPD on
the VMS system and connect to it from PINE on the unix system,
to much the same effect.

Note that MAIL.MAI alone is not enough: VMS MAIL uses also some
extra file names to store large items.  But if you use the above
methods them it should hide the details from you and just do the
job for you.

good luck

Subject: Reading PINE messages on a standalone PC

I have a limited file space on a PINE based email system which I telnet
onto. To gain more space, I have FTPed some of my old PINE folders onto a
PC.  Is there any software that will allow me to read and file these
messages on my desktop (not connected to any network) PC?  I have tried
using Pegasus mail to access them, but it will not accept the files. 
Alternately, the files appear to plain text, so I could write a program to
access them, but there appears to be no end of message markers, so there
is no easy way to break the files up.  The crudest solution is to use a
text file viewer, but since my files are upwards of 500k this makes
finding any individual message difficult, and deleting unwanted messages
very tedious.  Any suggestions?

Hi ! 

We have a cluster of IBM RS600 running AIX3.2.5

One machine in the cluster is having a problem. 

We are using pine 3.91

When I do ^X to send the message, the message is sent but 
the screen freezes after writing "Writing Fcc" and the only 
way to come out is to kill that window. Also the process
keeps running and cannot be killed even by root. So we have a 
lot of [pine] processes this way on the system which cannot be
killed. The same pine when mounted on other machines in the cluster
works fine. 

Anybody have any idea why it is behaving this way ?

Thanks in advance
Bye
Vijay

How do I find out whether I am using NFS or IMAP to access my mail.
I think I have the same problem at my site. 

We have a cluster of AIX3.2.5 and pine is in /usr/local on one machine 
and is nfs mounted over all the other machines on that cluster.

One one particular machine in the cluster, when trying to send the
composed message, it freezes with the message "Writing Fcc". It
happens on only this machine in the cluster. 

After reading the previous post on this subject, I realized that the
users who are complaining about this are the ones who have thier home 
directories nfs mounted from another machine. 

Thanks in advance

I tried this, but i started getting from the Mail Subsytem when the mail
was successfully delivered and not when it was opened.. is this supposed to
happen? and how do we make it such that we only get a 'RECEIPT' when the 
other party "opens" the mail.. ? thanks for any help.. nuj.

To any Pine Bug experts,
Yesterday, while composing a message to be sent, by computer froze.  No 
commands would activate anything.  Even Mac system commands did nothing.
So, I had to turn off the machine and re-start.  Now, whenever I go 
into Pine and "compose", I get a message to you want to continue the
interrupted message.  The cancel command says it has been deleted, but
the deletion does not take place.  If I say yes to the,"do you want to
continue the interrupted message", the screen says Bug In Pine and I 
get booted off!!!   What do I do???
Thanks for any help you can offer,

To me this sounds like a problem in sendmail (or whatever mail delivery 
system you're using). If you are using sendmail, then the DF class in 
/etc/sendmail.cf should be set to $S.

Since the system you are getting the mail from supports tcp/ip, you
would probably have the best success if you can get it to send you the
mail with a POP server.  Then you can use PINE,  Pegasus or whatever
on your PC to read the mail.  My ISP is set up so that I can use PINE
from the shell menu of their machine or retrieve any mail using a POP
client to my PC for local reading.  When I originate a message, it
gets sent to the ISP by smtp.  I use PINE with Linux and Pegasus with
Windows 95 in a dual-boot configuration.  They both work very well for
this purpose.

If you are Using Pine for Unix and SendMail, try using a .forward file, 
and spcify there the address you wish to forward your messages to.
More documentation on .forward in "man elm".
Good Luck :)

I've noticed that my Linux box from time to time is attempting to
send mail to mx4.u.washington.edu.  The pine executable does not
refer (as far as I can tell) to that host.  There are no
pending messages to be sent out in my mail queue...  Anyone
know if this is normal?

I decided to trap mail being sent to the address by re-routing
stuff for the mx4 address to my local IP - the problem hasn't
surfaced again yet...

Dear Sir/Madam,

Can you please tell me how I can change my address to add a name 
at the front of it.  That way I can have a name in front of my 
address which is currently just chamund@bournemouth.ac.uk  I would 
like people to know who is sending them mail rather than them just 
receiving my address.

If you can help I would be most grateful.

Thankyou,

Yours,

Sunil Chamund.

    Problem resolved.  Methinks this was transient and the result of a
transmission error on a poorly operating TCP/IP link.

That depends on your communications software.  I use windows 3.1 terminal

general you do it the same way you would download any other file ... in 
window 3.1 for example click on transfers then choose download binary etc 
then tell it the filename to download then tell it the path and filename 
where to put it on your pc.

I would suggest that you make a directory on your pc called C:\DOWNLOAD

have to go looking for it in your windows directory, in in your modem 
directory or wherever.  Then when in Word or WordPerfect or whatever, 
just retrieve c:\download\filename and use it (or move it to a floppy if 
you wish).

For the last couple of days, I've been using Pine to read news.  I've 
notice that articles are flagged with the "N" to indicate that they're 
new articles.  Once opened and read, this flag is removed.  If I open 
another folder for news a come back, these same articles are listed with 
the new flag.

The only way I've found to really mark them as read (and remove them 
permanently) is to do a ";aad" to delete them.  Is there something that 
I'm missing?  Is there any easier way to accomplish this?

Thanks,
Ray

This is easy in Pine: Go to the main menu and select Setup, Config. The
first field you should see is for a personal name that will be placed in
front of your address in the headers. At this point you can use Add,
Delete and/or Change to adjust the field to your needs. Normally your
correct name should be in the system's accound database (/etc/passwd), in
which case Pine automatically derives your name from there (you have to
keep this field empty for this to happen). Your Email address is
automatically appended to your name (by Pine), so you don't have to enter
this yourself. Good luck !

Xc`09V2U_MAIL, a hack by Rob Riepel (rob@ssvax1.ssd.loral.com)
Xc
Xc`09  This program was whipped up to convert my VMSmail to Unix.  I
Xc`09  hope it works for you too.  If you make improvements, please
Xc`09  let me know.  If you're seriously into hackery, use the callable
Xc`09  mail interface to parse through the VMSmail messages, and make
Xc`09  sure the Unix mail headers conform to the relevant RFCs.
X
Xc`09INSTRUCTIONS
Xc`09============
Xc
Xc`09v2u_mail will will read standard VMSmail files and convert them
Xc`09to Unix file files.  To use the program, first compile and link
Xc`09it.
Xc
Xc`09   $ FOR V2U_MAIL
Xc`09   $ LIN V2U_MAIL
Xc
Xc`09Next, assign the logical MAIL_DIR to point to the directory where
Xc`09all your VMSmail is stashed.
Xc
Xc`09   $ ASSIGN SYS$LOGIN_DEVICE:`5BMY_HOME.MAIL`5D MAIL_DIR
Xc
Xc`09Move to the directory where you want the Unix mail folders, and
Xc`09run V2U_MAIL.
Xc
Xc`09   $ SET DEFAULT `5BMY_HOME.UNIX_MAIL`5D
Xc`09   $ RUN `5BMY_HOME.V2U_MAIL`5DV2U_MAIL
Xc
Xc`09A Unix mail file will be created for each folder in your VMSmail.

    Put the cursor anywhere in the header area and press Ctrl-R (for 
"rich" headers).  Look for the Bcc: field.  If it is not there, you can 
go into your configuration and add it.

    When composing your reply, put the cursor anywhere in the header area 
and press Ctrl-R (for "rich" headers).  You should see a To: field, with 
which you can simultanteously email a copy of your post.

Subject: Please help- Info on pine3.91 makefile for HP-UX 10.0?
Status: O
X-Status: 

I just downloaded 'pine3.91.tar.Z' from ftp.cac.washington.edu, and I
uncompressed it and I "tar"-ed it.  So, all the files are out in the open,
but I can't find any files that mention HPUX 9.0 or 10.0- and we're using
10.0 at the school where I work.  I don't know what argument to apply to
the 'build' command.  The closest makefiles I found are for HP/UX 8.0
(called 'makefile.hpp').  I am worried that this 8.0 version of HP/UX
might be too different for me to be able to use the corresponding
makefiles to build our 'pine' application from the cource code.

I know we also have the option of downloading the binaries, but that
scares me even more AND moreover, it would take ANOTHER three hours!  So,
that's too much of a gamble if there's an easy answer.

Can anyone offer advice, or a makefile, for HP/UX 10.0 'pine
building'????  I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

X-Status: 

We run pine 3.91 on SCO 3.2v4.2 with 16Meg ram and 20meg swap.
Normally the swap is unused (with 24 users).

Pine causes some swap to be used, and a LOT in some cases.

We could have 10Meg of available ram/swap and one pine session with a 
2.2meg file (mime) can crash because there is not enough memory, or fail 
to fork when sending mail.

Is pine particularly greedy with demands on Ram?  Does SCO implement 
forks rather poorly (no page on write?).

Whats the opinion and how much swap is reccommened.

Another consideration is the following:
While you can modify your "personal name," and
"domain," your real address still may be displayed.  For example, at 
Boston College, if we change our domain and personal name, what you enter 
will show up.  However, if you pull up expanded header information (with 
h while reading a message), there is a slot in their where it shows your 
actual "real," from address; regardless of any change you make.  I am not 
familiar with how this is pulled up, or if there is a way to change it.  

Another option is the use of anonymous remailers, which strip out return 
address info.  Send a message to help@anon.penet.fi for info.  This is an 
auto responder, so it doesn't matter what is in your subject or message 
body.  Keep in mind, though, that like most things, these systems are not 
fullproof.  Your system administrator, in theory, could still see your 
outgoing mail to the anonymous server.  I guess it depends on exactly 
what you are sending the anonymous mail for, and to whom; how concerned 
you should be.

Mika Pyyhkala

I am running Linux with PPP and a dynamic IP address.  My internet

only if there is only a few pieces of mail but if there are

it should not take very long to download even though I gave it

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Hello,

I need to send a message to multiple recipients, and do now want each 
persons name/address to be in the body of the message.  I understand you 
can use the BCC field to do this, and have the following questions:
__What should be put in the TO field, to avoid confusion.  For example, I 
could put myself, but then it would appear as though I was mailing myself 
when people read the message.
__Is there a way to use a list of addresses for the BCC, rather than 
typing them in via the compose option spearated by commas.
I am using Pine 3.91 for Dos.

Thanks in advance,
Mika

	A colleague of mine just wrote a C programme converting files

mail files. It's working quite good since I've just converted about 30 
VMSMAIL folders to pine folders whithout any problems. If it can help

...cann't find the initial subscribed message, and therein is the problem.

How do I signoff from this list?  

The following is what I've tried, all of which has not "worked" to 
unsubscribe me...so thanks in advance

  sent to listserv@cac.washington.edu   signoff pine-info, got me a 
response that the command was invalide

  sent to listserv@cac.washington.edu   info refcard, got me to the next 
attempt

  sent to listproc@u.washington.edu     help ref.card got me to the next 
attempt

  sent to listproc@u.washington.edu for all the following...

  signoff pine-info got me   no such list error

  lists local got me a list that did not contain pine-info

  lists global pine got me a zero length list -- nothing had pine

So I've done all that I would initially think of, and seeing how the 
signoff must be sent to either a different server, or, has a different 
name, or both [leastwise that's what I'm thinking now], would someone 
tell me the steps necessary to signoff/unsubscribe from this, pine-info, 
list -- p l e a s e   :)

1.  Pine allows you to add extra headers beyond the set it offers as 
standard.  You can add these extra headers through the Setup 
Configuration screen, and use them (when composing a message) by placing 
the cursor on a header field then typing Ctrl/R.

2.  Some additional headers have magical meanings to SOME pieces of 
software.  For example one header REQUESTS the mail delivery agent (the 
thing which writes the message into the recipient's mailbox) to return a 
"delivery receipt" when it has done so.

3.  Another additional header is one that REQUESTS the mail reading 
program the recipient uses to generate a "this message has just been 
read" message and return it to the sender.

4.  Not all mail delivery software and/or mail reading software support 
these REQUESTS.  If a site does happen to use software that supports the 
feature then it is quite possible that the administrators of the site may 
have disabled the effects, as it can be considered a breach of personal 
privacy.

5.  So try the (as far as I remember two separate) headers by all means.  
But assume that you will NOT get any acknowledgement, and be pleasantly 
surprised if you do!  :-)

Cheers,

I suspect this indicates a problem with your INN software configuration 
rather than a problem with Pine....

Hostname appearing twice
------------------------
This is covered in the INN FAQ, Part 3.  See "How come my host name comes 
out twice in the path line?" in the "INN is running, but I have this 
small problem..." section.

Not-for-mail
------------
This _might_ be related to the above.  It would be worth checking the 
config.data you used to build INN and make sure that you used:
	PATHMASTER          not-for-mail
Otherwise try asking in the "news.software.nntp" newsgroup.

Cheers,

Okay thanks 

The file as far as I know is being sent by a MAC so I will get him to 
paste the file into his main message so I can read it. That part of the 
message I can read.

Thanks again and I will look into this.

We have a project to send a large text file (20 pages) to our
customers everyday. Since we are using the slow dial up connection,
sending these information is time consuming and become too expensive.
Although we can send to a list of e-mail address within one message,
it will expose all the e-mail address to each customer. Could somebody
give us some hint on doing that? Is it possible to transfer the text
file to our unix account at ISP first and run some program for
background transferring?

Please reply to legal@dbis.com.hk if possible!

Just an idea, how about using a commercial email package as this
requirement is supported as a 'normal' feature. We use DaVinci and I
know that CC Mail can do the same using Blind Copy. 

Another idea is to use the mail list feature - so your customers see
the mail list name and nothing else.

If you're using something like Eudora you can use the bcc: header instead
of the CC: header to hide the names of the other customers.....

Thanks for your help and suggestions.

I did see the "hostname appearing twice" item in the FAQ and
configured INN to handle it.  Same for the "not-for-mail".  That is
why the "inews -h" command seems to work.

Since my posting, I've modified the inn.conf file to:

  server:           news.quoininc.com
  pathhost:         news.quoininc.com

which produces with pine:

  Path: news.quoininc.com!quoininc.com!jplejacq
  NNTP-Posting-Host: quoininc.com

and with "inews -h":

  Path: news.quoininc.com!not-for-mail
  NNTP-Posting-Host: quoininc.com

I still believe that pine is overriding the inn settings.  The path it
generates may actually be ok.  Any further ideas?

Pine also supports bcc: headers.  From the main menu enter C (Compose)
and then ^R (Rich Hdr).  If pine is properly configured, you'll see
the bcc: header at that point.

However, what your customers actually see is dependent on your mail
transport agent (e.g. smail, sendmail) and not pine.  They may still
see the entire list.  See help for the bcc: header which you can get
by ^G (Help) when the cursor is on the bcc: header.

Pine posts the message to the NNTP server, and has no access to it
thereafter.  There is no way Pine can over-ride anything INN does.

I'd like to use pcpine (as a imap client) in diskless PCs and a

How to configure pcpine to use the "login" name as the sender?
Is it possible?

One data point: Pine (virtual) memory use will be dramatically affected by
the mailbox format you choose to use.  Pine's mailbox driver for Unix
"mbox" format reads the entire mailbox into virtual memory.  In contrast,
the Tenex driver does not, but there are relatively few mail programs that
support Tenex format, so there is a compatibility tradeoff.

For lots of info about setting up filtering, check out my
Filtering Mail FAQ at:

 http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/

Good luck,
Nancy

PS - I'd appreciate your feedback on this page, which is
an example of a "FAQ Launcher."  Does it make sense? Is
it useful? What other info would you like to see in it?
Any suggestions for improving the layout, etc.?

I would like to be able to view the full headers of messages which I receive.

According to the help message that comes up when I press "?" while reading a
message,  the "H" command should enable "Full Header Mode".  However,
when I give the "H" command,  I get the message
   Command "H" not defined for this screen.

This happens in both Pine 3.91 and Pine 3.89.

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

-Alan

I found the solution.  In the setup configuration I have to set the flag
called "enable-full-header-cmd".  After doing so,  the H command works.

I am interested in finding written reviews about Pine, how it works, and how
it is generally accepted by its users.  I would also like to find a good
source of user feedback.  I have checked the Web site, but it does not seem
to have exactly what I am interested in.  If anyone could provide some
feedback to me I would appreciate it. 

Thankyou,

Pine is trying to be helpful here...

Messages you receive FROM others have the "From:" address displayed in 
the index.

Messages you send OUT to others but keep a copy for yourself somehow 
(Fcc'ing to a folder, Cc'ing yourself a copy, etc) show who th emessage 
was sent TO.

This is more useful than simply listing your own address in the index as 
its acts as an aide memoire who the message was sent out to.  This is 
VERY useful is folders where you keep copies of outgoing messages, such 
as the sent-mail folder.

You can DEDUCE the message is from you because the "To:" field is shown.  
Only your own outgoing messages are listed in this way.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

You don't say in your message what platform (UNIX, DOS, Windows or VMS) 
you are using.

If it is UNIX then the initial username/password prompt can be avoided by:

1.  Set up a (symbolic) link from /etc/rimapd to point to your imapd 
executable.

2.  Set yourself up a .rhosts file so that the computer on which the IMAP 
server runs "trusts" the host you run Pine on and allows you to rsh from it.

3.  Check you have set both of the above up properly by giving the 
following command on your normal (Pine) computer:
	rsh nameofyourimapcomputer /etc/rimapd
If all is well you will get a welcome banner.  Respond by typing:
	A001 logout

Having done this your Pine session should then start without prompting 
you to enter username and password.

I logged into PINE today, to find my INBOX had disappeared, i.e., there 
were no messages in it, even though the day before, there were.

Is there any way to recover a crash like this?

Do people back up their INBOXes, or is it in the hands of the Gods?

Many thanks,

Joe Luttrell

You need the later pine391a.zip version that fixes the

Are you interested in news groups?  If so, try these for Eudora:

  comp.mail.eudora.mac - Eudora email software for Macintosh. 
  comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows - Eudora email software for MS Windows. 

I'm not sure where you can discuss POP, maybe in one of the comp.mail.*
or comp.protocols.* groups.

Good luck,
Nancy

Simply put all of the addresses in the Bcc: line and send yourself a copy 
in the To: line. Some mail routers will display the Bcc: addresses if 
there is no address in the To: or Cc: lines. You may wish to send out a 
test mailing to verify that there is no problem. The Bcc: line can be 
revealed by moving the cursor up above the "----- Message Text -----" 
line and hitting ctrl-R when you are writing the mail in pine.

This may well NOT be the solution to your problem, but is (hopefully) 
useful to someone...


We run a collection of SGI machines running IRIX.  Mail is stored on a 
disk locally attached to our mail server, which runs IMAP daemons to 
access it.  We use Pine (from UNIX) and ECSmail (from PCs) to access said 
mail over IMAP.

As a concession to the few die-hards and also to let shell mail checking 
work we also NFS mount the mailstore on each of the other IRIX systems.

Occasionally some bright spark(!) "discovers" that their mail is 
delivered slightly quicker if they send it to 
"username@name-of-current-machine" rather than "username@york.ac.uk" (the 
latter going to our mail hub).

The result is that their mail is NOT passed to the mail hub, but the 
local machine they are using instead delivers the message into the 
recipients' mail folder (writing to the mailstore over the NFS link).

UNFORTUNATELY there is a bug in IRIX involving NFS mounted mailstores 
(possibly also more general ... I don't know).

The upshot is that the recipient's mailbox becomes inaccessible on the 
machine which delivered the message into it over NFS.  This is apparently 
to do with problems with file locking over NFS and assorted other gubbins.

The upshot as I say is that the recipients' mailbox can no longer be read 
from on the machine which delivered the message into the box over NFS.

In particular if someone tries to use a non-IMAP mail program (Elm, Pine 
not configured to use IMAP, etc) then they get either an error message or 
(as is the case with Pine) an empty INBOX presented to them.

However IMAP can be used successfully to access the folder (the IMAP 
server is running on the mail server and accessing the disk locally, so 
NFS is not involved).

The only ways we have found out of the above situation when it occurs is:

*  Wait for some sort of timer to expire, or
*  Reboot the machine, or
*  Login to another machine as root, copy the mail folder to a new file, and
   mv this back over the old one (changing its i-node and restoring access).

Our verdict:

*  Use IMAP for mail access.  It *is* good!
*  Be wary about NFS mounting your mailstore.
*  If you must NFS mount it (eg, so that sh can stat it and check for new
   mail arriving) consider exporting/mounting it read-only.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

I have recently upgraded to Sendmail 8.7.3 and I'm using the userdb
function to replace mailname@domain to First_Lastname@domain for
outgoing and incoming mail. 

Mailx uses this feature without any problems, but Pine continues to use
the mailname for outgoing mail.  I have tried various changes to .pinerc
to no avail, such as not setting any user or domain information and
quelling mailname lookup in the passwd file.

Could someone let me know if this is do-able with Pine 3.91. or if there
is a newer release that supports this.

Thanks,

If I may ask an obviously ignorant question....how do you create a 
.signature file in your home directory?  I am very new to the UNIX

By reading the help menu in pine, you will find instructions that tell 
you to goto setup/config/ and then put in the name of the file...and then 
continue down and x the "add sig at end of posts" place.  Sorry for the 
hazy wordings. :)

To follow up on myself; Terry Gray tells me that pine's unix mbox driver 
loads the whole mailbox into ram.  Oh woe!  Oh well, at least I know.

No wonder its slow compared to elm.

Hello!

I recently received a complaint about two users getting the same piece of 
mail. Normally this would be normal, except that the sender swears that 
the message was sent to only one of them.  Ok fine.  I verified that 
there are no aliases and no .forward files that would account for this 
behavior.  

Then I remembered that sendmail on this machine (AIX 3.2.5) is configured 
for SETGID.  I then further remembered that this is a shared lab, where 
PC-Pine (Windoze/Winsock version) resides on the local workstation and  
prompts users for their username and password.  It occured to me that it 
is possible that PC-Pine (3.91) is not correctly deciding what spool file 
to use when it connects.  

User 1 connects to the mailhost and retrieves mail.  They then quit 
PC-Pine and User 2 fires it up.  User 2 connects to the mailhost, 
authenticated as User 2, but is able to access User 1's mailbox because 
of SENDMAIL being SETGID.

I'm still waiting for the actual mail messages with full headers to 
verify this problem, as I cannot re-produce it on demand.  Is there any 
way that PC-Pine could be acting as I've described ? (Maybe without 
exiting it before the next person goes into it ?)

On a related subject, should SENDMAIL be run with or without the SETGID 
option ? Is it safer and more secure or is it more of a problem ?

Thanks!

Michael

First, thank you Joseph for contributing the script.  After seeing a 
recent post about it in this group from me, Bruce Pleat of Qualcomm 
contacted me and asked for a pointer to the script.  So keep your eyes 
open.

Indeed, going from Eudora Nickname --> Pine address book is a much 
tougher problem.  Joseph Davidson mentioned that:

>Eudora does not require these [first and last name] and 
>if they are there, are there as part of 
>the address, such as "Joseph Davidson <jdavidson@interguru.com>" 
>(quotes not included.)  The name does not have to be in any 
>special format.

The last sentence here is the key -- there is no special format, not 
even a regular or predictable format.  For example, my nndbase.txt 
doesn't look at all like your example.  Here's a few lines [names 
changed to protect the innocent]:

alias ZimbabweNet Zimbabwe@mathcs.cmu.edu
note ZimbabweNet [this line contains all kinds of things about ZimNet, 
including unreadable ASCII chars for carriage returns I typed in the 
Eudora Note: window]
alias CFNPP [addresses of several co-workers]
alias "Joe Blow" jblow@econ.cit.cornell.edu

So first the script would have to clean things up by trashing all lines 
beginning with "note", and getting rid of the "alias " at the beginning 
of all the other lines.  Parsing the Nicknames themselves, however, is 
tougher, because if there is a space in the nickname, it is enclosed in 
quotes, but if there's no space, no quotes.  As for sorting on last name 
a la Pine........aargh!  And then if it hit a nndbase.txt file with 
names in the format you showed...

Mind reading is indeed required.  Maybe future versions of Eudora could 
make it easier to do this.  Delimiting the nndbase.txt fields with tabs, 
instead of spaces, seems like a simple (perhaps simple-minded?) start.

I would also like it to be as easy to convert my mailboxes from Eudora 
--> Unix (Pine or just plain "mail") as it is to convert Pine --> 
Eudora.

But it seems that pine sets the Path: header before passing the
message to INN.  INN then adds to this header.

It doesn't seem appropriate for an MUA to do this.  Can this behavior
be disabled?

Thanks for the help,

Hi

I installed sendmail 8.7.3 because I needed the reverse aliasing feature.
I need rewriting from "andi@koala.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de" to something else. It
works fine with elm, and mailx but not with pine! I think it's because pine
puts a qualified From line itself when sending the mail. Does anybody know
how to fix this?

Thanks
Andi

PS. Here is my userdb:

andi:mailname	Andreas.Muck@stud.uni-karlsruhe.de

I tried also with the full address instead of "andi" but it didn't work

Mail to anybody at "u.washington.edu" will go to mx4, among others, since
mx4 is one of the incoming mail servers for u.washington.edu.

Move the cursor to the first character of the first line you want to cut.
Hold CTRL and SHIFT down, and press the 6 key.
You'll see a note [Mark Set] appear centred at the bottom of the page.
Use your down arrow key to highlight the lines you want to cut.  If you 
want to cut more than just a few lines, use CTRL-V to page forward.
When all the text you want to cut is highlighted, use CTRL-K to cut it.
If you wish to paste the text elsewhere in your document, move the cursor 
to the first character of the line where you wish to insert the text.  
Use CTRL-U to uncut the text.

Hint:  If you set the mark at the wrong place, doing CTRL-SHIFT-6 again 
will produce the message [Mark UnSet]

Hello,
we have problems with the mime base64 encoding. Nearly all of our
customers use uudecode/uuencode an cannot decode the base64 format.
Is it possible to switch pine to uudecode/uuencode (mailcaps ??). If not
can someone tell me a Internet resource where I can get base64 decoder
for the different systems ( MS-DOS, Linux, Solaris, ... )

Thanks in advance,	
	Norbert

How about a Z-Script program?  Then you wouldn't need to mess with 
converting the message to your UNIX system at all.

The Z-Script cookbook and reference manual (available at ftp.ncd.com in 
electronic form) describes the scripting language pretty well.  Perhaps 
you could do something like this:

1) send the message to yourself.

2) run your script on it.
	the script might be something like this:

		for recip in fred@bedrock bill@whitehouse queen@palace
			mail -f msg_num $recip

	I'm fairly sure this is not the right syntax, but the idea should 
be pretty solid.

Am I the only one that finds this annoying?  In compose mode in
pine, ^X means "send message," yet when using pine's pico editor
alone, ^X means "exit."  On several occasions I have sent an
undesired message when I forgot which commands were in effect.

This strikes me as an oversight, and perhaps in future versions
it can be corrected.  In general I like pine, but the command to
send a message should be unique.

Hi, list!

The question: I have set Pine 3.91 to save sent messages by recipient. It 
works O.K. except when there is no To: line (it happens). Most annoying 
is the case of news posting. I don't then see Fcc header when composing, 
but if I hit ^R, I suddenly discovered that all news posting are saved in 
sent-mail folder. Pine makes it silently without even inform me about it.

Is it possible to supress it? I don't normally save EVERY mail or news I 
send. 

thanks in advance

I'm not 100% sure, but...
If you mean you marked everything in your INBOX as deleted and then 
purged them, probably not.  If your site runs regular backups of the mail 
server (where your INBOX resides) you could try asking them about 
recovering your INBOX...
Anybody with a differing opinion, PLEASE feel free to jump right in here...

>What does "cc" means in the header of pine?

The term comes from the early (pre-computer) days of sending letters.
If you had to send two copies of a letter to different people, you'd
stick two sheets of paper in your typewriter separated by a piece of
carbon paper.  The carbon paper would reproduce your keystrokes on the
second sheet.  The second copy was called a "carbon copy".  It wasn't
unusual to see letters that ended with "CC: John Smith" after the
signature, which indicated that John Smith also received a copy of that
letter.

Nowadays we're well beyond carbon paper.  If we want multiple copies we
either tell the computer to print more than one, or we carry the sheet
over to the photocopier and create all we need.  In email, we can create
infinite duplicates by specifying more addresses in the "To:" field --
or, in the "Cc:" field.  It's customary to use the "To:" field to show
who's directly addressed in the letter, and the "Cc:" field to show
other people who are not directly addressed but who should also read it.

There's a third field called "Bcc:", or "blind carbon copy".  You use
this line to specify other addresses which should get the email note,
but who's addresses should *NOT* be seen by the other recipients.  For
example, I might send you a note and "Bcc:" it to your sysadmin if, for
example, I had a serious problem with one of your postings and
thought he ought to know about it, but *didn't* want you to know that I
told him.

Since the days of real black-finger carbon paper are long gone, "Cc:" is
now often called "courtesy copy" instead of "carbon copy".  The purpose
is the same -- you're sending a note to an additional address as a
courtesy.  Most people still refer to it as a "carbon copy", however.

The default action of Pine is NOT to automatically save any message you 
send.  To change this you have to set up the "default-fcc" configuration 
variable, which I presume you have done.

Once done this is now the default: for all messages (mail or News) you send.

If you want to temporarily suppress it for the message you are currently 
composing simply summon up the Rich Headers (^R with the cursor on a 
header field) and erase (^K) the Fcc: value.

If you keep forgetting the Fcc field consider setting up a default list 
of headers on the Setup Configuration screen that includes it.  Remember 
that this list REPLACES the default set, so remember to include the usual 
things like From, To, Subject, etc.

I think you're confusing Pine with (standalone) Pico.  The "send message" 
command in Pine *is* unique: it's ^X.

As a courtesy Pine's quite handy built-in editor is also made available 
as a separate program: Pico.

Within Pine's built-in composer (Pico in disguise) ^X means "get me out 
of this editor and back to Pine, saving my changes and sending the result".

Within Pico ^X means "get me out of this editor and back to UNIX, saving 
my changes".  Is it _really_ so different? :-)

The fun REALLY starts when you start flipping between, say, GNU Emacs and 
MicroEMACS where ^X^C get you out, but one asks you if you want to KEEP 
the changes you have made, and the other asks you if you want to DISCARD 
them.  Now *that's* fun!

Indeed, Eudora Nicknames files are in a standard format, that used for 
Unix mail aliases (the Unix command mail, not Unix-based mail programs 
like Pine).  One could easily append their nndbase.txt onto their 
$HOME/.mailrc file (after deleting any "note ..." lines) and the aliases 
would be there when using the mail command, which is more of a true 
standard than Pine is.

It *IS* just as easy, but I swear this wasn't the case in earlier 
versions of Eudora, or am I completely losing it?  Just copy the Eudora 
 .mbx file over to the Unix box, and it's readable by "mail" and Pine.  
I haven't figured out yet how the message flags are handled (all N or 
all blank I could understand, but some of each?), but that's not a big 
problem for me.

Thanks again Scott.

    Change to your home directory at the shell prompt (usually the cd 
command will do this) and use a text editor to create the file .signature .
How to do this?  Unfortunately there is no single, simple answer, because 
there are a short jillion text editors available for Unix systems, and I 
have no idea what is available on your system.  They are all different.

    However, if you have Pine, you _probably_ have its associated separate 
text editor Pico, which is very easy to use.  Just switch to your home 
directory and try entering

        pico .signature

and see if anything happens.  If Pico _is_ available (in your path), you 
are in luck.  Just compose your signature.  Then press Ctrl-O to save it 
and Ctrl-X to exit Pico.

Date: 31 Jan 1996 22:15:09 GMT
Message-Id: <4eopld$12m4@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 

   Is there a way to invoke pine (v. 3.91) that will override all locks on
the inbox?  After a reboot of the mail server, pine freezes on any change
to the inbox.  I can successfully read the mail I have received, but when
I expunge or quit (and pine attempts to write my changes) the program
simply freezes up.  The problem is limited to our machines running Solaris
2.3. 

   I can obviously remove the ***.lock file in the mail spool
directory, and as well can remove the pid file that is created in /tmp,
but neither will release my inbox.  I looked at the web site, and found 
justifications for the multiple locks, but no way to override them in one 
fell swoop.


Thanks,
Ed

Here is my attempt at writing a "FAQ-like" description of how I got the 
USERDB to work with pine.  I sent this to the Sendmail FAQ, but it
hasn't been added since I last checked.  I'm using an older version of
sendmail (8.6.12 I think), so there are no guarantees.  I would
encourage you to post a "feature request" or the likes to
comp.mail.sendmail about this.  I did so a while back, but never got
any response.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
  * How do I get the user database (userdb) to work with Pine.

        The basic incompatibility with Pine and the user database option
        is in how Pine writes From addresses in the header.  Most MUAs 
        write the From address as "From: user", while Pine, for reasons
        given in its documentation, write the From address as 
        "From: user@FQDN" (FQDN=fully qualified domain name).  Because of
        this difference, the user database does not rewrite pine headers.

        One solution to this problem is to make the following change in
        /etc/sendmail.cf after you have the user database option installed
        and working with other MUAs:

        In the "local info" section, add the following:

                # Define our userdb file for pine rewrites
                Kuserdb btree -o /etc/userdb.db

        After ruleset 0, add the following as ruleset 1:

   ##################################################
   ### Ruleset 1, rewrite sender header & envelope ##
   ##################################################
   #Thanks to Bjart Kvarme <bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no>
   S1
   R$- < @ $=w . > $*   $: $1 < @ $2 . > $3 ?? $1       username@localhost ?
   R$+ ?? $+            $: $1 ?? $(userdb $2 : mailname $: @ $)
   R$+ ?? @             $@ $1                           Not found
   R$+ ?? $+            $>3 $2                          Found, rewrite
        
   #NOTE      ^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   #          Use Tab Characters  Use Tab Characters in these regions
   # to make three columns (the line with "mailname" only has 2 columns).

        Now the user database should re-write messages sent with Pine.
        If this still does not work for you, try adding the following
        to either the system wide pine.conf, pine.conf.fixed, or your 
        personal .pinerc:

                user-domain=localhost

        This has been known to help solve the problem for some people.

	I'm getting the message, "Mailbox format invalidated - Consult 
expert" when closing a folder and going to another one. Is this related 
to some of my outgoing mail not being stored in the 'sent-mail' folder? 
Could anyone shed any light on these two issues? They don't always occur 
at the same time.

I believe this mail will be seen by all users of pine.in case anyone
has a solution to my problem please do let me know:

i have tried compiling pine on the above mentioned operating systems
i.e SCO UNIX and SCO XENIX,without success.In case of sco xenix i guess
one will have to port it rather than compile it since many of the libraries
seem to be missing.But in the case of sco unix ,libcrypt seems to be
missing in my development system and in the process of compilation
pine asks for this library.In case any one has compiled pine
on any of the above operating systems,mail me some help,i'll be grateful.

thanks
