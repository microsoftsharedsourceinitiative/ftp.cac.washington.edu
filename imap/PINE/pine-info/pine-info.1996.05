Alas, PC-Pine does not yet support POP.
Planned for later.

Interesting question.

Note that for users who are logging in to interactive Unix accounts,
you have the "msgs" program to put out system messages, plus the
/etc/motd "message of the day" file. (unless they figure out
".hushlogin" :-)

Also if you can get everyone to read Usenet news, you can post to a
newsgroup and request that everyone subscribe to it. (voluntary
solutions like this are not always feasible or desirable though)

But if users are accessing their mail remotely via IMAP and not
logging in to your server, neither seeing "msgs" nor "/etc/motd", what
then?

Sending mail to all users, one copy to every mailbox, really is not
the ideal way to accomplish your goal.

Perhaps IMAP could use something like the "POP bulletin" facility,
available with the Qualcomm Pop3 server. This does exactly what you
suggest, it uses a single master copy of the message, which is then
automatically downloaded by every POP3 client. (well, so there ARE
multiple copies generated, one on each POP client's hard disk, but at
least not in every mailbox on the server system disk, and not going
through the mail queues and local mail delivery system!)

With POP bulletins, all POP3 users will see the latest bulletins added
since their last Inbox download session, as if they had actually been
delivered to the user's inbox (mail spool drop file). Bulletins are
accessed by the POP server as individual message files in a system
directory, e.g. /var/spool/pop. Every user has a ".popbull" file
recording the number of the last bulletin they have downloaded (we've
modified our copy of the server, to keep a user's record as
".username.popbull" in a common /var/spool/pop directory, so we can
have POP-only users with no home directory on the server)

We are hopefully going to offer IMAP-only service sometime in the
future, so we would be interested in such an "IMAP bulletin" facility.

I guess you COULD do it by requesting all users to subscribe to a
certain shared "sytem bulletin" IMAP mailbox... which could indeed be
a Usenet newsgroup ....

You COULD put such a subscription into the fixed global Pine config,
for interactive Unix login Pine users at least, but then again they
would all see the "msgs" and /etc/motd anyway.

The real question is, what about remote IMAP-only users, using
PC-Pine?

Chris,
IMAP has the concept of an "ALERT", but this is oriented to single
line messages, e.g. "System going down in 20 min."

With Pine or PC-Pine, a user will be asked to acknowledge the alert.

There is nothing in IMAP to prevent stuffing a canned message in each
mailbox, but this would indeed take up space in every mailbox.

Some form of shared folder arrangement makes sense, but Pine doesn't
provide any particular help in making sure people see it.

Ok Jon, I have just taken your advice I typed...


	set TIN_DOMAIN=ssnShirt.com
	export TIN_DOMAIN
	tin


So, next day I'll find out if your advice works 
in real life.  Also, if you're an ISP and can 
give me a local connection, and this idea of 
yours works, drop me some email and we'll 
talk money.

I have recently recompiled pine (3.93 for the first time) and really enjoy
the things you have accomplished with this wonderful mail reader. No longer
should it be considered a beginers' toy. However following the compilation
I have come across a problem:
When I open the actual inbox (/var/spool/mail/bandregg) as in starting pine
without command-line arguments or -i A message appears saying that pine
cannot create a mailbox lock /var/spool/mail/bandregg..... . Our mail drive
is actually setup on another partition as /misc/mail with a symlink between
/var/spool/mail and /misc/mail.
Is it possible that this is the problem. My laptop at home with only one
partition doesn't complain. Root on either system has no problems.
the os:
Linux 1.3.97

To fix this, in pine3.93/imap/Makefile, look for the bs2 entry and add the
missing SYSTYPE=ANSI (look at the other entries to see what needs to be
done).

If you have gcc, use gso.  It's the best way to avoid the problems brought
on by SUN's compiler and BSD compatibility library.

As far as "which version of imapd to use":
	Pine's copy is the oldest.
	The one on ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z is the
	 newest.
	The Solstice Internet Mail Server version is based upon an older
	 version of the ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z one.

All that whining on the list.  Don't any of you know how to send e-mail? 
And how come each of you twits increased the size of the file.  First it's
1.2, in the next its 1.5 and in the one quoted its 1.6. 

I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  But, serious folks, I would like to
take this opportunity to complain (on the list) about all the twits
complaining (on the list) about the large (and ever growing) post.

Exactly, that works in 3.89, 3.92, and 3.93.  After someone mentioned that
pine now fills in the "to:", I actually stopped filling it in myself.  The
"undisclosed recipients" stuff is actually described in either the help or
other documentation, and if I remember it correctly the string is
configurable.  Oh, by the by, the problem that feature fixes isn't actually
in pine per se, but in old sendmail programs.

I use mkpgp 2.0 which works quite well and is fairly feature rich.

Try joe (get by anonymous ftp from ftp.std.com, file:
src/editors/joe2.8.tar.Z).  It includes 'jpico'- it's like pico, only it's a
real editor.  From jpico (or native joe) control characters can be entered
by prefixing them with `  (to enter a `, you hit ``).  So to enter ESC [ H,
you would type ` <esc> [ H or ` [ [ H.  To enter backspace, type ` H,
` Ctrl-H, or `008.

This isn't a function of Pine, Netscape, or any other mail reading program
(they are for reading e-mail *after* it has been delivered).

Instead you need to persuade the system software that received the mail on
your behalf and files it in your INBOX to send a response.  This is often
done using a program called "vacation" and a ".forward" file.  You can
read about the former (on UNIX systems) by typing "man vacation", and the
latter by typing "man sendmail".

However it may be that your site doesn't have "vacation" installed, or
perhaps uses something other than "sendmail" for delivering mail.  Hence
your best bet (as is often the case with such questions) is to contact
your local Help Desk or service provider: they know what software they
provide and use -- the rest of us around the world don't!

(In passing, one does wonder why you send a message about using _Netscape_
as a mailer to a mailing list/newsgroup which discusses and provides help
about the _Pine_ mailer!  :-)

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Hi,
        I am using unix-Pine ver 3.91 running on HP-UX. I have gotten 
Pine to invoke my application depending on content-type from a mailcap 
file. In my application I need access to the mail header. (the sender's 
email address for example) Is there someway I could get this from inside 
my application? Does Pine set any environment variables with data from 
the header?
thanks,
sumanth

Is there a command that allows you to automatically respond to messages 
when you receive them with a pre-written message??  How would you enable 
the command "man vacation"?  Thanks for your help.

Dear PUG (Pine User Group)

pine-3.91 / HP-UX 9.05

One of our users causes the following scenario several times:

He has set the feature enable-alternate-editor-implicitly, using vi.
Then he stops pine with CTRL Z and exits the host. Maybe (= I am sure 
;-) that he tries some other CTRL keys before.

After that /tmp is filled with tons of files Ex* which all belong to that 
user. If another user wants to invoke vi he can't because all available
Ex* belong to the other user.

Did somebody else experience this situation?

TIA for any hints

Hi there .. I would 'kill' :-) to find out how I can do filtering in pine?
For instance, I want all my mail that comes in AND has the word "pine" on 
the subject line, to go into a folder called Pine... Or every email that 
came from a certain sender to be put into a different folder and then 
forwarded/bounced back/deleted/whatever....

What can someone recommend to make Pine able to do these things? It is a 
great mail prog, but it still lacks some powerful features that for 
instance, elm had(filtering)... Anyone gimme a hand out there? Thanks in 
advance...

Martin

Hello,
What happened to pine feature of informing newly arrived message by
sound? I could not figure out how I can configure pine so that this
feature is re-enabled.
Thanks.

This does *not* happen with pine 3.92 and Solaris.

I suggest you login as a user and use vi directly.  Then use ctrl-z to
suspend vi.  Check the /tmp directory for the name of the Ex file and
then exit the system.  (Don't you get a warning saying "suspended jobs"?)
Then reconnect to the system and see if the Ex file still exists.

    Pine has no built-in capability to do these things.  However, for
mail filtering, if elm's 'filter' is still available to you on your
system, you can still use it, and Pine will cheerfully use the results. 
(I don't know about 'kill', as I am not familiar with filter.)
Otherwise, on Un*x systems procmail can be used for both filtering and
kill function.

    If you have a WWW browser, you can get more information by browsing
my home page and following the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  You will
have to follow a few more links, as I do not have direct href's
available, but Nancy has a lot of good material on mail processing.

I tend to leave my PC-Pine32 running on my office workstation
when I go home at night.  I occasionally wish to access my
mail from home over a dialup IP connection, which is not really
a problem.  I run Pine from home, it acquires the mailbox lock
from the office workstation, and I merrily read and compose
mail.  The problem (well, annoyance, really) is that when I come
back to the office, I have to exit Pine and start it up again to
get the mailbox lock back -- when Pine lost the lock, it went 
into read-only mode.

My greatest wish for Pine at this point is that there is some
option on the menu to force acquisition of the mailbox lock
manually.

Respectfully,
Todd.Aven@BankersTrust.Com

Sorry, but to add to this, when I start up, I get:

tgetent: warning: termcap entry too long

Does this mean it's definitely a problem with termcap?

But, if we're using PC-Pine, we're out of luck, right?

At a Danish keyboard, the command key is ^+ !  Probably the best
advice is "Control and the second key left of the erase key".

Killing is done with the "filter action" 'delete':

If you need to get fancy then procmail is what I recommend.

Subject: How do I suspend pico? Please help.
Date: 3 May 1996 19:04:41 -0400
Message-Id: <4me3e9$g5s@mcmail.CIS.McMaster.CA>

Apologies if this is not the correct newsgroup, please point the way if 
there is a better one...

My question has to do with pico. Specifically when it is invoked as the 
editor for replies or postings from within the trn newsreader.

I can enable suspending when pico is invoked from the command line.

I can do the same when (I believe) Rnmail prompts for the editor; again 
by typing pico -z.

The problem is that I would like pico when invoked by Rnmail(?) to 
default to pico -z. (also without wordwrap and/or any other options)

Our sysadmin said that he could set the default to enable suspending. He 
said that months ago. Short of going over and banging on his head is 
there any way that I, as a user, can set this default?

Thanks for any info;

I'm not sure if this has to do with pine or the termcap, but in linux
1.3.97, termcap file 9.8.1, I enter pine with term="linux"  When I hit c for
compose, it works fine and goes to the compose screen.  However, once I try
to enter something in a text field, it starts beeping constantly, saying,
"Unknown command"

Check out the file attributes for .pinerc. A friend of mine have had the

I'm not familiar with Pico, but you normally do this in editors by
preceding the <Esc> with some sort of quoting character.  For
instance, you would type <Ctrl-V><Esc> to enter <Esc> in vi or
<Ctrl-Q><Esc> to do it in Emacs.  I don't know what the quoting
character is in pico (or if it even has that feature, although it
probably does), so you need to check the pico docs.  (It might also be
referred to as "escaping" rather than "quoting", confusingly enough.)

Also, "$e" does _not_ represent <Esc> in DOS.  $e is simply a special
code that tells the command processor to output an <Esc> character
when used in a prompt string, in much the same way that $p will tell
it to output the current path; this feature does not come into play
when editing files, only when setting the prompt.

Lastly, you should be able to e-mail files of ANSI escape sequences
without encoding them; typically, only files containing high-bit
characters (character codes higher than 127) need to be encoded.  Keep
in mind, however,  that if you read the received e-mail in a
terminal-mode (as opposed to GUI) mail-reader on a Unix system and
it's not encoded, the ANSI codes will be immediately "executed" and
may mess up the screen display.

Hello out there!

Is there any way to change the standard "On <Date>, <Name> wrote:" which
appears in the top line of my reply to someting different? (Without using
the editor :-)

Is it possible to have a different line for different recipients? (for
example to answer in german to german recipients and in english to others?)

I beg pardon, if these questions are FAQ's.
I woud apperciate answers via PM, because i'm no regular reader of

Thanks in advance

    Although it may be possible to do it, this is NOT A GOOD IDEA for
email and -- especially -- Usenet news.  When you imbed control
characters in mail or a news article, what actually happens is
determined at the other end with any particular recipient's terminal
hardware and software, which will vary from recipient to recipient. 

    For some recipients, control characters may have the effect that
you, the sender, intend.  For some recipients, control characters can
just cause major problems and may even cause their terminals to lock up
entirely.  All that may happen is a lot of angry cursing.  You have no
control over the outcome when you imbed control characters in your
email and news group postings.  PLEASE DON'T DO IT.  (World Wide Web is
another matter, as there are defined standards.)

Question: How to invoke pico by other programs including some pico command
line options like -z.

How do you tell you newsreader, mailprog etc which editor to use?  In the
setup(s) of these programs it should be possible to define an editor incl.
command line options.

If the editor is generally defined by the environment variable EDITOR (try:

	echo $EDITOR

to check it), you could try to set this variable accordingly, i.e.,

	setenv EDITOR 'pico -z'	(csh)
	export EDITOR='pico -z' (bash, ksh)

Another try would be to define an alias for pico, i.e., 

	alias pico '/full/path/name/pico -z'	(csh)
	alias pico='/full/path/name/pico -z'	(bash, ksh)

Yet another: write a small script which invokes pico correctly:

	#!/bin/ksh	# or whatever shell you prefer
	/full/path/pico -z $*
	# $* is all the options given by invoking prog.

Now call this, e.g., 'mypine' and make it executable, i.e., invoke command

	chmod u+x mypine

Then you define this new "editor" in your programs as the one to use, or
maybe set the EDITOR variable similar to above examples to this program.

Hope it helps,

Hi Chip,

	Question: Where does Baltimore County have its PINE mail program
pointing its Folder-Collections configuration line to? Is it /Mail or
/Work, where the user uploads and downloads to?

	The Freenet that I am on, that has PINE has it fixed for /Mail and
when it comes time to rename the Sent-Mail folder, the old Sent-Mail folder
is stuck in the Mail directory, unless Freenet Staffers, moves the folder
to the /Work directory for downloading purposes.

	Thanks in advance!

3.  For more advanced Macintosh computer users: compressed attached
     text file, created with a Stuffit(tm) self-extracting archive (.sea),
      ~133K.  Can be decompressed by any Macintosh computer user; no
     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed.  You
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as 
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut 
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in

Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Jean Chevalier and I recently started using a magazine
subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal
with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They
have over 1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a
subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they more of a
selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for most every
area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of
what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people buy
magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes or
hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to make
it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper than all
their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the publishers
themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half their business
comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new members who only speak
limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.  I
don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are less
than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other times,
just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.  They
assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.  

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from a
special list of over 270 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.  

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a charge
for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie subs) that
varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be very
friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change when I
moved from one country to another.
 
The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls you
personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes he has
one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he insists on
setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't
want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future orders (after your
first order) via E-mail.   

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas, he
will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he still
makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long distance
rates are cheaper then.  

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had a
2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they could
join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately when you
call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new members  the
same day or within a few days now, as they have increased their staff.  I am
not sure about this.........but if you email the above form to them, that is
the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what he
sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Jean Chevalier

Subject: ANSI ESC Sequences in Pico/Pine?
Date: 2 May 1996 22:39:04 GMT
Message-Id: <4mbdi8$eng@news2.cais.com>

    I am interested in creating some very simple files using Ansi <esc>
sequences. I would like to type them using Pico from a Unix machine. Is it
possible to activate these <esc> sequences in Pico? What keys would I
literally have to type in order to activate the sequences? For example, I
know that the sequence to set colors is "ESC [ #;#m", where # = different
numbers depending on what colors you want to have. But typing the "esc"
key, followed by the "[" key, etc. in Pico has no effect. Is there some
sequence of keys that would be interpreted as <esc> in Pico (I found a
document on the Web which said that <esc> is represented as "$e" in DOS,
for example)? So what exactly would I type, in Pico, if anything, to
activate these sequences? Or would I have to type the files on my home PC
in DOS, encode and download them or something? I am able to view ANSI
color files using the Unix "cat"  command on my internet provider's remote
machine. I know that you have to "uuencode" ANSI files in order to
actually mail them. I'm not so much interested in that, just learning how
to create some very simple ones, as I said. Any help would be greatly
appreciated. Please post or email.

Sort of.  Open a news group folder and enter the two characters:  $s

Similarly, to mark all items as "read" enter the four characters: ;aad

Peter,
Why can't you "invoke a filter on request" via the pipe command?

Can someone tell me if there is a news group for TIN?  I'm looking for 
some help with it.  All I know to do is press h while using it, but I'd 
like more detailed help.

This seems to be the closest news group for asking this question, so I 
hope no one minds even though it isn't about Pine.

	From the main menu, type "a".  This brings you to the address
book.  Then type "?".  This brings you to the documentation.

Unfortunately, no.  The newsgroup news.software.readers has posts on tin,
though, since it's a newsgroup for the discussion of newsreaders in
general.  

You might try the command

man tin

which may, if you use shell access, show you the tin user's manual.  The
writing isn't the best, but the information is very helpful.

Is there a way to configure Pine 3.93 to leave copies of messages on
the server so that they can later be retrieved by Eudora?  I know that
Eudora can do this, but I would like it to work both ways if possible.

Hello everyone,

I'm currently attracted to PC-PINE v. 3.93 for its DOS support.  We have an 
application where our network users need to Telnet to our Telnet Server (which is 
also our Email Server) and running a DOS-based (required) email program such as 
PC-PINE for DOS to send/retrieve email remotely.  Our network is build around the 
Windows NT 3.51 instead of Unix and the Telnet Server package we are evaluating is 
SLnet by Seattle Lab.  The Email Server package is Post.Office by Software.com.

For testing, I try running PINE locally from my Windows 95 workstation.  What 
happened was that when trying to access Folder List-INBOX, PINE reported that 
"HOST NOT FOUND".  During SETUP-Configure, I have tried using both the host name 
and the actual IP address for the "inbox-path" parameter, but still with no luck 
with either.  My Netscape 2.0 for Windows, however, has no problem connecting to 
our emailserver for sending/receiving emails.  At first, it seems to me that 
PC-PINE for DOS requires some sort of DOS' TCP/IP setup and won't work with 
WINSOCK, but I also tried running PC-PINE for Windows with the same result.  It is 
understandable if PINE can't recognize the host name, but the actual IP address?

What have I done wrong?  Has anyone else the same application like mine?  Any 
feedback will be greatly appreciated because I'm in a desperate situation since 
PC-PINE is the only DOS-based email program that I know of (unless you can tell me 
about others).  

Phil N.

Hello

	I have a problem using pine to read mail on a remote POP account. 
I use pine version 3.90. I would like to read mail stored on the account 
[name]@[host].[domain]. The only setup field I modified is the 
inbox-path. I changed it to {host.domain}INBOX. When I start pine, it keeps 
telling me that the connection is refused. Are there any fields in which 
I should enter my name or my password ? Should pine ask me for them ?

Please answer by email. Thanks for your help.

This error almost always means that your mail server does not support
imap.  Ask you support folks to install an "imapd".   (See Pine tech notes

Because the filter swallows all output of the filterprogram -e.g. the
request for the pgp pass-phrase- until the program is finished. Well, it
works, but it's uncomfortable.

BTW: I think a good Idea for a filter would be the option to disable the
use of the pine viewer/pager in order to pipe the output directly to the 
terminal. This would solve my problem (via a script) as well

I am heavily impressed with pine. I'd like to know if there 
will ever be a supercite mode or something like that in any future
releases of pine? Thanks for any response.

I'm running pine3.91 on my A/UX box and I'm having a problem with the
return key being remaped to ^j.  I believe that the return key is actually
sending ^m, but pico seems to think its ^j and wants to invoke the justify
text command. 

Thanks!

Pine3.92-3 doesn't strip independent comment like (this is a comment) in
the To: field as pine3.91 did.  As a result, such a message is displayed
with the line "Error in To: address" on the bottom of the screen as
shown below.  (Also shown below is the same message displayed by
pine3.91 for comparison.) If "Reply to all recipients" on the message,
the comment is treated as an address and an error   
[ To field: Missing address after comma ] is displayed.

Is this a bug of Pine3.92-3?  If yes, can it be fixed in the next
release?

Is there a way to re-send mail that has been undeliverable?  
For example:  I send a message to joebloe@wax.umd.edu and it is bounced 
back because it should have been wam, not wax.  Is there anyway to just 
change the x to m and re-send it.  I am using pine 3.91.

TIA

Hi, folks!

Does anybody have a Pine icon for X? (This fine pine-tree) Or at least
just the picture - probably, I will be able to convert it to X-icon.

thanks in advance

Have a read of the documentation; Unix Pine I hope you meant.

This is taken from docs/tech-notes/installation.html:

Most of Pine's behaviors are set in the file ./pine/osdep/os-xxx.h,
which includes comments that explain each setting. Some of these can only be 
set when you compile. Others, however, can be overridden by command-line
flags to Pine or settings in Pine's user or system configuration files.
Some of the options which can be set when compiling: 

ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM 
     Determines whether users are allowed to modify the From line on
outgoing mail. Even with this turned on, users will have to include From in 
their default-composer-hdrs or customized-hdrs in order to be able to
edit the From line. Default is to not allow any changing.

Is there a way not to have pine ask you to delete your old mail folders?  
And how about not asking to move your current sent-mail to 
sent-mail-apr-1996?

	Yes, in your .pinerc file file this line:

# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.
last-time-prune-questioned=96.5

	And change it to something like....99.12.  Hummmm....what happens
in the year 2000?  (Oh, pine 4.0 fixes that....  :-) )

Your last session with pine didn't terminate properly.  Perhaps your
terminal session disconnected without killing your login shell.

try:
kill -9 39163

	Geeee....I hope not.  :-) :-)  I have a hard enough time with
some of my users and pico.

	But, seriously, couldn't you use the "alternate" editor feature

In the year 2000 it will be 100.x and in 2005 it will be 105.x.  It's
year-1900, same as in struct tm from ctime(3).

You can just rip it off their web page...its in xbm format already.
If you want, its on my ftp site:

Subject: Pine (3.93) doing RSH, not IMAP?
Date: Mon, 06 May 1996 17:46:22 GMT
Message-Id: <318e387b.11541758@news.tuwien.ac.at>

Pointing Windows Pine 3.93 to a remote folder at my ISP works fine
from our departments subnet using the "G" command and the folder
location "{ping.at}INBOX".

The same procedure on SunOS 4.1.3 with the very same folder location
causes Pine 3.93 (and below) to "wait forever and a day".

That left me somewhat clueless until my ISP e-mailed my postmaster
complaining about a user repeatedly trying to log into his systems
using rsh, which he does not allow because of security problems.

I don't believe that IMAP requires rsh, does it? - So why does
something work from a PC and not from a Sun on the same subnet when
both use the same version of Pine?

Any hints would be really appreciated,
Gerald

This may be a bad idea. Some mailer software treats a single period

across the internet to my account that uses (ugh!) Microsoft Mail.
A period in the first position in one of these messages cut off the
rest of the message at that point.

By default, Unix Pine trys to open a pre-authenticated connection via
rsh before trying port 143.  You can tell Pine to go straight to port
143 by specifically designating the port, e.g. "{ping.at:143}INBOX"

Addresses are 7bit, ie there are no umlauts allowed.

Well yes.  If you don't have the legal right to software you

Not exactly, but I am a retired lawyer who at one time worked full
time for a software development company.  I think I understand
the sort of advice that FSF likely to be getting.  I also
understand how strongly some programmers resist such things.

This would be enough protection for most users, but I can
understand why FSF would want an actual assignment prior to
integrating something into its releases.  Anyone can make
anything "GPLed" by just inserting that text into it.  The
formalities of the copyright assignment more appropriate to the
situation of the FSF.

Perhaps, but why should FSF make an exception here and change its
procedures and rely on the validity of the GPL?  Suppose that the
code was GPLed without proper authority?  Could the true owner
not then revoke the GPL or serve notice that it had never been
valid?  The fact that something was issued by someone with the
text of the GPL attached is not at all as strong as a set of
assignments by all who might have an interest.

Subject: Can you disable message highlighting?
Date: 6 May 1996 21:19:50 GMT
Message-Id: <4mlqdm$a7h@coranto.ucs.mun.ca>


     I am wondering if it is possible to stop Pine from highlighting
messages.  When you cursor around through the e-mail messages received,
the current message is highlighted - printed in reverse.  A few months
ago I was using a 1200 bps modem.  It took a fantastic amount of time
just to move the cursor from one line, to the one below.  (And I mean
fantastic in a Very disparaging sense.)  In order to cursor down
through a whole bunch of messages in the Folder Index, it takes a
considerable amount of time.  (Actually, it was sheer hell.)
 
     It's fairly easy to see why it takes so long just to move from one
line to the next.  The screen is 80 columns wide.  When a certain
message is selected, the ENTIRE line, all 80 columns of it is
highlighted.  This line contains the name of the sender, and the
Subject of the message.  What happens when you Cursor down is this.
The current line is printed normally, unhighlighted.  Then the cursor
moves to the line below, and this line is re-printed in reverse.  And
finally the cursor is moved to the bottom of the screen.
 
     Now think about this.  In order for all this to happen, at least
160 or more bytes must be transmitted over the phone lines.  Codes for
reversing and un-reversing printed text need to be sent.  80 characters
need to be printed unreversed, and 80 more need to be printed reversed
on the line below.  And all of that just to move from one line to the
next!  There is no need for any of this.  It really bogs down slow
modems.
 
     Only now that I have got a faster modem and the problem is not too
annoying now is it reasonable for me to find this news group and try to
ask this question.  But with the 1200 bps modem, such a task as finding
places to ask such questions was rather arduous.  :(
Isn't it ironic, don't ya think?
 
     It is possible with both Lynx, and with Tin to avoid having all
selections highlighted.  Normally with Tin, the current selection of
its listing of usenet postings is highlighted.  But there is an option
to prevent that, so that only an arrow to the left of a selection
indicates which posting is selected.
 
     Lynx normally highlights all links.  I am not sure if Lynx has an
option to stop that, but I have seen other Lynx programs which don't
highlight selected links.  The cursor just sits next to the selection.
Thus, it is very quick, even with the slowest of modems.
 
     My question is: Is there an option in Pine to disable the
highlighting?  I am sure that there won't be any 1200 bps modem users
reading this message (my message seems to have gotten a bit long).
Many people likely wouldn't be bothered by the situation I have
described, because they have fast modems.  But I would appreciate an
answer.

There is a feature called "assume-slow-link" in the Setup/Config screen.

	Hope you don't mind that I shortened your question?  :-)

	Answer, yes.

	In the setup/config simply enable:

	[ ]  assume-slow-link

Yes indeed. In the main menu go to Setup/Config, then scroll down to the 
"assume slow link" checkbox and check it.  Pine will use an arrow at the 
left to indicate the current message instead of reverse video.

As far as finding answers to some frequently asked questions over a slow 
modem, you could go to the Pine FAQ or Secrets of Pine documents at U-dub by
going to the Setup/Updates , and searching these documents using 
the Where feature. (although the answer to this particular 
question is not on the FAQ ;^)

Here's an example.  Initials of the poster, no nesting if other users
use SC.  All quoted paragraphs can be re-wrapped correctly, preserving

Thank you! I can type Chinese using Pico 2.7 (bundled with Pine 3.93?!) as
external editor now. 

However, before, I could type Chinese (8-bit characters) directly in the
internal editor of Pine 3.91. Does anyone know why it is disabled? Or is
there any compile time options to set?

Thanks.

Regards,
Davy

Here's a question that doesn't seem to be covered in the FAQs:

What is the best way to configure Pine so that it leaves _all_ mail on the
server and can just be used as a newsreader?

Thanks.

Any ideas?  I found the 'config' section of pine, and switched the=20
character set to iso-8859-1.  Now I can type an umlaut (=FC) in the body of=
=20
the text.  This is very cool.  But the email address I am trying to reach=
=20
has an umlaut in the address ITSELF.  Whenever I type the umlauted u in=20
the address, i get a bar (|) character instead. =20

Any ideas?  I am having this problem with two different Internet Service=20
Providers.  Haven't tried compuserve yet...

TIA,

We are testing PC PINE for Windows 3.1 with characters in the IBM code
page DOS/850. We have configured PINERC with the "character-set=ISO-8859-1"
option. 
But when editing the messages, the characters are displayed with the ASCII
convention (not ANSI wich is the windows display mode).
Is there anybody who have tips ?
Thank you for answering.

Have you tried playing with the custom header and using a Reply-To line.
It should be in the configure area.
I have heard that, that is a nifty way to accomlish the task.

A while ago, there was some comments going on about a group mailbox type
of thing.

WHat I am looking on doing is setting up an alias as 'PARTS' and putting
all the people in the parts dept. in the group. When a new message comes
in to parts@xxx.com, it will go to all members of the group. But when one
person replies, I need to either get rid of all other messages, or notify
all other members of the group that the message has been received.

Or even better, how about setting up a local usenet group with threading.
So that other people can comment on the subject, but still have it go back
to the original sender.

Thanks in advance.

Mark

Please, if you want/can answer me, please send the message to my login,

Is there a way to set up Pine for saving a note which is being written while 
the connection to your provider drops ?

Any one who ever ran into this situation will appreciate the poignancy of
this question.

Any and all suggestions are very welcome.

I have found an occasional need for editing headers even with munpack.

     NOTES
	  If a MIME message is forwarded using a non-MIME compliant
	  mailer, its MIME encoding will not be	recognized.  To	fix
	  this,	save the message as a file and edit the	file.  Look
	  for the first	Content-Type: mail header, and copy that
	  header into the first	"paragraph" of mail headers, somewhere
	  after	its first line.

When connecting to ftp.cac.washington.edu and cd'ing to /pine, I can get the
file listings fine.  When downloading, I can download fine.  However, when
running 'uncompress' on a BSD/OS v2.0.1 system, it hangs.  When 
CTRL-C'ing out of it and terminating the process, the pine.tar file is there;
when tar xvf'ing the pine.tar file, it only shows up with one volume of the
archive (contrib/, bin/, and README).

the .gz file doesn't work at all.

Hi there,

  I just upgraded from pine2.89 to 3.93. Now I have the following problem:
Sometimes the Compose-Screen is not displayed at all. E.g. I am in the
main menu and type "c". No changes on the screen. But pine actually is in
the compose mode. When I type "^c" pine asks "cancel message (...)?". The
same happens sometimes with editing addresses. 

My machine: RS6000/AIX 4.1.3
            
I tried 2 ways for installing pine3.93: the precompiled version for AIX
and I also compiled it on this machine with a patch which was posted in
this news group.

Would be nice if anybody could help me. 

Jo.

Pico cannot read lines over 255 characters in length without wrapping.

One way to do this is to have a single shared "parts" folder and let
everyone read it.  First, set up a user "parts" with an INBOX in
/usr/spool/mail/parts (or wherever is appropriate for your system).
Then for everyone in the parts dept, add

	incoming-folders=PARTS /usr/spool/mail/parts

to their .pinerc file.

Note that with the default berkeley format folder, only one user at
a time can have read/write access to the shared folder.  An
improvement would be to use tmail to deliver to a Tenex format folder,
which allows full read/write access.  Tmail is available in

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

   change the x to m and re-send it.  I am using pine 3.91.

I don't know of any mailer that can do this automatically.  What I do in
pine is forward the bounce-gram, manually write in the address and
correct the Subject: line, and then strip out the bounce-related lines
from the message body.

Am using Pine 3.93.  Have REPEATEDLY changed and saved-changes to Config
Setup so the .signature does NOT appear at the bottom of a reply-message
(i.e. AFTER the quoted text).  Yet every time I re-enter Pine, the setting
is back to SIG AT BOTTOM.  How can I change this (remove the X in the
Config setup) and make it STICK?  Thanks!

I was just reading through the pine
(http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/secrets.html) documentaion, and found
the following reference:
    The "signature-at-bottom" feature only applies to Replies. It is not
    possible to force your signature to the bottom of the included text
    in a Forward.
I think this will answer somones question, I saw the post but deleted it
because I didn't know the answer at the time.

	No Fair!  You're *reading* documentation!  Next thing you know
you'll be reading all the "help" screens and all the information in
the .pinerc file!

Have a read of the documentation; Unix Pine I hope you meant.

This is taken from docs/tech-notes/installation.html:

Most of Pine's behaviors are set in the file ./pine/osdep/os-xxx.h,
which includes comments that explain each setting. Some of these can only be 
set when you compile. Others, however, can be overridden by command-line
flags to Pine or settings in Pine's user or system configuration files.
Some of the options which can be set when compiling: 

ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM 
     Determines whether users are allowed to modify the From line on
outgoing mail. Even with this turned on, users will have to include From in 
their default-composer-hdrs or customized-hdrs in order to be able to
edit the From line. Default is to not allow any changing.

Really, eh?  The nerve.  Users helping themselves.  What if we *all* did
that?  What would happen to the listserv then, huh?

Heh :-)

While I'm here, could anyone tell me where I'll find the information on
creating a distribution list in 3.92?  I've taken repeated cracks at it,
but haven't successfully done it.  I can add/change/delete individual
nicknames in the addressbook;  that's about it.

Any help much appreciated.

Lea

	Well, from the main menu you could type "a" to go to the address
book and then type "?" and space down until you find the section on
"DISTRIBUTION LISTS".

	But, maybe all you need to know is that creating a DL is exactly
the same as creating an alias.  The only difference is that once you add
more than one address to an alias it becomes a DL.  Simple as that....

	I'm not what you mean by this question.

	The answer is yes.  If you have a text file on disk and want to
send it as clear text you simply use the control-R function in pine and
it will read the file into the body of the message.

Barry,

I'm running on Solaris 2.4 and had the same question.  As I understand it,
use "gso" if you have `gcc' (GNU C) installed, otherwise use "sol".  Since
I have gcc on my machine, I used "gso" and it built fine for me.

Greetings: I have been asked to inquire if there is a way to compose text 
in a accuented way. Iguess this means using some of the characters of 
other languages or in some wait accent characters.

Does anyone have any suggestions or experience if this is possible using 
pine for Unix?

Thanks

Jim

In the absence of a specific question I will choose to answer thusly :^) 

In the Attchmnt: field of the header, type the name of the file you would 
like to attach.  Pine encodes the file in MIME format which means the 
recipient must have a MIME-compliant mail program to read it. I attached 
a small text file to this message. If you're set up right you can read it...

The alternative is to use ^R while in the pine editor (pico) and read in 
the file directly into the message.

Well, I'm using a 2400 bps modem to send this reply... I don't know about 
TIN, and I'd say with Lynx, you're out of luck.

But in Pine, go to your main screen, choose "S"etup, then "C"onfig.  Go 
down through your list of configuration options and find this one:

            Set        Feature Name
            ---   ----------------------
            [X]  assume-slow-link

Check this box, and the highlight will be replaced with a little arrow 
---> next to the message.

I haven't noticed this problem.  I am on AIX 4.1.3 and compiled 3.93 with

As a new user of pine email, I have a question. To use pine on our campus 
email system, my userid was shortened. Because of this the address on the 
outgoing email reads Ron Ritsch rather than Ron Ritschard. Can this be 
fixed? I don't want to change my name at this stage of my life.

Thanks, Ron Ritschard (ritschr@email.uah.edu)

To me the crucial distinction is that PC-Pine can use the IMAP protocol
as opposed to the POP protocol.  This means that users are not bound
to a particular PC.  They can switch between PC's at work and home or
switch machines in the lab while their mail folders remain on one server.

  Hi,

  I had a french version of Pine (not pretty enough to give it out), but
I'm planning to translate version 3.93 too if enough people would be
interested. GNU's administrators are looking for localized versions of
GNU licenced programs (according to GNU Bulletin), but I just did the
translation for some students in France. I'd be glad if someone would be
interested in the program itself too. Hope it's not already done :-)

  Unfortunately I have no plan on the tutorial and docs, but the both
things should be done accordingly to be efficient and clean.

  IMHO

I have the green tree icon from PC Pine for Windows on:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/pine/


If you use it, please make a copy of it rather than pointing
people at my copy (and increasing my bandwidth use).

Thanks to Johan Pae for extracting the Pine icon for me.

	Well, its a good thing you gave us your real email address.

	Chances are it is *not* pine's fault.

	But, have a look in your setup/config at:

       OPTION: User-Domain

This value specifies the domain part (right-hand side) of your return
address on outgoing email and is also used as the default domain for email
composed to a local user.  If unset, Unix Pine will obtain the domain from
the system.  Often this value will be set for your whole site by the
system administrator.

If you set this, see also the "quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file" feature.

	This should help you...

Is there a way to have Pine automatically sort all the letters in a folder
by the absolute real time and date - e.g., by GMT?  This would allow me to
order all the letters in a correspondence - both letters by me and
letters from my pen-pal - *in sequence* as they were actually written.  I
see no other way to do this at present, except by sending them to separate
folders.

Thanks.

Not quite.  If the message is From you, then it shows who the message is
To.  The match to determine "fromness" is based upon the email address. 
In your example above, msg 1 was from you, whereas msg 2 was from root.

Catalogue Format Options:
1.  19-Part email- can be read by EVERYONE (~525 K Total).
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached text file ~525K - you
     must know how to download an attached text file and then be able to
     open it with your word processor.  If in doubt, don't ask for this
     version.  This isn't for internet *newbies.* Better to order option 1
     and spend a few minutes pasting them into one whole text document
     with your word processor, than to waste hours trying to figure how
     to deal with this option.
3.  For more advanced Macintosh computer users: compressed attached
     text file, created with a Stuffit(tm) self-extracting archive (.sea),
      ~133K.  Can be decompressed by any Macintosh computer user; no
     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed.  You
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as 
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut 
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in 
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be 
     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with
     Stuffit(tm),  ~114K.  Can be decompressed by any computer user who
     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your
     download time by 78%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in option
     #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be able to do.



Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Helen Ng and I recently started using a magazine subscription club
in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal with your first
paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They have over 1,500
different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a subscription
basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they more of a selection
than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for most every area of
interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of
what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people buy
magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes or
hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to make
it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper than all
their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the publishers
themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half their business
comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new members who only speak
limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.  I
don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are less
than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other times,
just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.  They
assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.  

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from a
special list of over 270 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.  

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a charge
for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie subs) that
varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be very
friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change when I
moved from one country to another.
 
The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls you
personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes he has
one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he insists on
setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't
want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future orders (after your
first order) via E-mail.   

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas, he
will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he still
makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long distance
rates are cheaper then.  

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had a
2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they could
join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately when you
call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new members  the
same day or within a few days now, as they have increased their staff.  I am
not sure about this.........but if you email the above form to them, that is
the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what he
sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Helen Ng

Subject: inconsistency in pine index for news
Date: 8 May 1996 21:10:05 GMT
Message-Id: <4mr2jd$pib@news.jhu.edu>

We just upgraded to pine 3.93 on an SGI running Irix 5.3 and I'm now
getting complaints about how pine handles the index of a newsgroup.  As
an example, I sent a couple of messages to our test newsgroup.  When I
enter the newsgroup, the index shows this:

      1 May  8 To: jhu.test          ignore this test
      2 May  8 Doug O'Neal           ignore

Message #1 has the headers
    Path: news.jhu.edu!jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu!doug
    From: Douglas O'Neal <doug@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu>
    Newsgroups: jhu.test
    Subject: ignore this test
    ...
and message #1 has
    Path: news.jhu.edu!grinch.hcf.jhu.edu!root
    From: root@grinch.hcf.jhu.edu (Doug O'Neal)
    Newsgroups: jhu.test
    Subject: ignore
    ...

My best guess is that pine is reading the From: line looking for a name
in parentheses.  If it finds one then that name is listed as the sender,
otherwise it uses the Newsgroups: line as the sender.  Can anybody confirm
this?  Is there a workaround to get all the messages listed as being from 
the actual sender?  Thanks.

First of all, thanks to all those who posted the advices on compiling on 
the SCO.

I finally got the compilation completed using Gcc 2.7.2 compiler.  
Everything seems fine except during sending e-mails.  I'm getting a 
Undisclosed recipient:  ; attached to my outgoing e-mails even though I 
have specify an e-mail address.

The e-mail goes to the correct destination but it included the Undisclosed 
recipient.  It also send back an e-mail saying undisclsed recipient not 
found.

Any ideas?  Below is the message I get.

Not sure if "should" is the right word here...  mail punting can be
distinct from mail sending.  It's probably not a bad idea, but I
wouldn't see it as required behavior.  I may not want the email to
go through the backup MX records for the domain, especially if it
turns out to be unqualified or awaiting the proper qualification at
the SMTP server end for whatever reason.

Heh...  only makes sense if you happen to have sendmail running locally.
If I can limit where insecure MTAs run, I tend to want to do so.

I'm not sure if it's related but I'm having some problems with using
a send-filter defined as pgp -fast.

The problem displayes itself with the text :

 Enter pass phrase: cannot open tty, using stdin

 Unable to get terminal characteristics: ioctl: Operation not supported on
socket

Anyone has a cure for this ?

I'm using pine 3.93 and pgp 2.6.3i

No, I meant PC Pine for Windows/Winsock.  I know about
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM in Unix pine and that works great.
I'm wondering if there's something like that that I
can do in PC Pine.  If there isn't, does anyone know
if there are any problems having a couple invocations
of PC Pine for Windows running simultaneously and using
different PINERC files?

Thanks,
Nancy

Hello all!  I'm new here - but just checked the archives (unsuccessfully) 
for the answer to my question:

I know that I can edit my .pinerc and change the last time pruned field 
to 99.12 and not get the end-of-month questions RE my sent-mail, etc.  
What I'd like to do, tho, is not have to edit the 6000+ pine rc's we may 
have on our campus.  Is there any way to set a system-wide field to 99.12 
- and let individual users override that?

Bonjour, on m'a forwarde ton message, car j'ai aussi demande la meme 
question, a savoir s'il existait une version francaise du mode 
d'emploi PINE. Je suis (en dehors d'etre etudiant) moniteur dans une 
salle d'info pour les etudiants en Lettres et beaucoupe de monde 
commence a utiliser PINE. J'ai telecharge tous les documents 
necessaires depuis Internet (Getting started with PINE, PINE user's 
guide) et j'ai commence a faire une traduction de ces textes,pour que 
les etudiants puissent en profiter. J'aimerais savoir ce que tu fais 
exactement a ce sujet pour eventuellement combiner nos efforts et ne 
pas faire isolement la meme chose. Tu peux me contacter par e-mail.

I have noticed that with our new version of pine my deleted messages are
not deleting from my inbox.  Is there something new we do now to delete
old messages?

Subject: HELP! How do I define the DELETE and BACKSPACE keys??
Date: 9 May 1996 16:08:18 +0100
Message-Id: <4mt1p2$fkv@jupiter.fcrd.gov.uk>


I am using pine 3.91.

I've noticed that the BACKSPACE and DELETE keys both do the same thing 
(i.e. do a backspace). I would very much like to define DELETE to behave 
in the normal way (i.e. delete the character that the cursor is on), 
while leaving the BACKSPACE key as it is.

Can anyone tell me how to do this?


Thanks in advance,

  Tim Porter

In version 3.91, if I received an email message and there 
was only me on the To: list, when I replied to the sender
I got the normal compose message. I was not prompted for
a Reply-To-All?.

Now, in 3.93, I get prompted for Reply-To-All? and if I
say yes, my own id gets added to the CC: list.

Is this a bug with 3.93, or a new feature?

Even when there are others on the CC: list and I answer
'Y' to the prompt, my id gets added to the reply list
when I do not want it there.

Is there a way to fix this?

Hi.  I am a new user of Pine.  I have some simple questions:

1. I know how to save a news item by using S-key, but if I want to save 
many news items, say, I want to save news items ranging from #100 to #300, 
do I have to hit S-key 201 times?  Or is there a better way to do it with 
one command?

2. How to delete (or mark as read) all items with a specific subject?

3. After I have read all news items, how do I mark all items as read? 
(Again, I know how to use D-key to mark a single item as read, but how do 
I mark ALL items as read?)

Thank you in advance.

Qingchun Guo

I have a question concerning pine.  The help menu did not have the
information that I need.  What are the letters in front of the message
sent list telling me?  How can I tell if a message has been posted to the
server, if the message has been read and the time of message receipt?
Thanks for your help.

To whom this concerns, 

There's been a problem w/ your new version of Pine (3.92)

When I forward mail, or sometimes just regular mail, Pine seems to add an
extra repeated line of the email right after my signature file and right
before the original message.  This extra line is usually a repeat of a
line that had been in the email on the "screen" before, in the exact same
spot as it had been in the previous "screen".

Please tell me how I can prevent this from happening again in the future.  
Thank you for your time.
(I will forward you one of the emails that I had test mailed to myself to
see if the problem would occur again.)

This is the problem that I was describing to you in the email I sent
earlier.  Please take a look at it and tell me what I can do to prevent
this from happening in the future.  Again, thanks for your time.  I will

To make the index always show the From:, go to the Setup/Config screen

I've been using Pine for a while now, and have been rather impressed
overall...  I've recently upgraded to 3.93, and have had reason to begin
using IMAP to access mail from home, as well as from various places around
campus...

I've had one problem, however.  When I want to access/use an IMAP mailbox,
Pine asks me for my userid and password *every* time I go to check that
mailbox, read the index of the box, read a message from the box, write a
message to the box, et cetera.  In short, any *single* IMAP request needs
another login.  When sending mail with an FCC, this can get pretty hairy
(I think I had two or three logins *per message*!).

Is there an option I'm missing to have Pine remember your IMAP password
throughout the session?  I'm getting a little frustrated here...

Thanks,
Jason

is there a way in 3.93 to make "unfiltered" my first choice
instead of my pgp filters?  i would like to make those the
optional ones, and  not have to answer no to get at the
unfiltered option.  i know i could make a benign filter that
really doesn't do anything and put that first, but was curious
if there is another way to do this.

Proper use and maintainance of MX records is pretty much a requirement for
successful internet mail delivery.

As it stands now if you point your smtp-server at a machine with a valid MX
record which does not run sendmail in daemon mode, the message will not get
delivered. Also it you have 4 machines that all can accept mail for a site,
but only one of those hosts has an A record for that name, then Pine can not
take advanatage of the reliability that the redundent mailservers provides.
It will only deliver to that one host. This will most likely cause users
fits when need to leave for a class but can not deliver their mail message
because one machine is down.

I would like to have the smtp-server list point to sonmething like;
1st) ${department}.umd.edu ( a MX list for each depatrtments mailservers)
2nd) glue.umd.edu ( our toplevel MX'd list of servers as a fall back)


: 
: :Also for the unix side, it would be nice if you could allow the mail message
: :to queue locally if all the smtp server connection attempts fail.
: 
: Heh...  only makes sense if you happen to have sendmail running locally.
: If I can limit where insecure MTAs run, I tend to want to do so.  

Actually it makes sence when you do not either. I have about 800 Unix boxes
and only run sendmail (in deamon mode) on about 40 of them. Sendmail still
gets execed on the clients, and I have to check for things in the queue
every 30 minutes, but they do not accept connections. Most every other mail
application needs this capability.

That pine has the ability to connect directly to an SMTP server is nice, but 
it should do it with similar robustness of things like "sendmail" that it is
trying to skirt. (i.e. understand MX records)

I conced that some of these may be switched options, but they really should
be part of the code base.

As an aside, this same poor behaviour with eudora has been sysadmins bain
for years. You have to go and reconfigure thousands of PC's every time you
make changes to ths smtp servers. I would hope that Pine could do one step
better and support MX records for smtp-servers on PC's also.

Thanks for listening,
Randall

I need to set up a machine for anonymous pine use. The imap server
is on different machine. This "pine server" will be used mostly by
people with dumb vt100 type terminals through a dial-up server.

What I envision is a default userid that runs /usr/local/bin/pine
as it's login shell. I noticed that there are a couple of command
line options for pine (-a -nr) that, on the surface, seem to be
some kind of anonymous mode for pine. That's what I need, an anonymous
instance of pine. I'm working on a /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed
now that will probably go a long way. 

What I would like to know is, has anyone (U of Wash??) done 
something similar, and if so, could you share some tips of
what you did?

Thanks.

I'm not sure what anonymous pine does. Where can I read more 
about what the -a and -nr options do?

What I want is a pine that does everything remotely. I want no
folders or incoming mail on the "pine server". I want everything
on the imap server. Very much like PC-Pine I guess. Of course
the users couldn't set or change any options.

That does seem pretty excessive! :)

I'm pretty sure I remember seeing something related to password caching on
the list of things fixed for 3.94...  (Coming soon)

Hi, everyone :)

I have an odd problem.

I have--well, had--an extensive personal configuration file with Pine, I
love the program.  I am on a Linux-based ISP, whose system administrators
are still
running Pine 3.91 (and since they are my coworkers I keep bugging them to
upgrade...hopefully they will).  I've searched the archives and the help
files and have yet to find anyone else asking about this, so I will.

When I SU out to root, if I accidentally run PINE (as I might do,
forgetting that I am root and not me) it calls up Pine and everything is
hunky-dory.  If I quit out, then exit, to become myself again, PINE treats
it as if this is my first time running pine, complete with the intro
screen.  It writes the default configuration file over my .pinerc.

The same thing happened even when I aliased pine to pine -p conffile, and
set up a conffile--it wrote over the conffile with the default pinerc.  I
don't understand this behavior, and I find it very frustrating that I
can't run pine as root and subsequently as myself without losing the
configuration.

If anyone could help me via an emailed reply (I work in tech support, and
rarely have time to read the enwsgroups as much as I should) I would be
most grateful.

Running Pine 3.91 on a Linux 1.2.13 system.

Thanks in advance,
Scott Roberts

     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as 
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut 
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in 
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be 
     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with
     Stuffit(tm),  ~114K.  Can be decompressed by any computer user who
     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your
     download time by 78%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in option
     #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be able to do.



Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Jennie Conroy and I recently started using a magazine subscription
club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal with your
first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They have over
1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a
subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they more of a
selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for most every
area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of
what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people buy
magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes or
hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to make
it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper than all
their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the publishers
themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half their business
comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new members who only speak
limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.  I
don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are less
than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other times,
just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.  They
assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.  

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from a
special list of over 270 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.  

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a charge
for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie subs) that
varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be very
friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change when I
moved from one country to another.
 
The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls you
personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes he has
one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he insists on
setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't
want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future orders (after your
first order) via E-mail.   

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas, he
will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he still
makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long distance
rates are cheaper then.  

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had a
2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they could
join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately when you
call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new members  the
same day or within a few days now, as they have increased their staff.  I am
not sure about this.........but if you email the above form to them, that is
the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what he
sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Jenny Conroy

Randall -

     The brief answer to your request is that the requirement for MX
records has to do with MTA (Mail Transfer Agent, a.k.a. "mailer") 
interchange with other MTAs. Pine's SMTP code is not, and is not intended
to be, an MTA.  It is merely mechanism for queueing a message to an MTA. 
There are no RFC requirements on a mechanism for queueing to an MTA.

     I believe that you may have a serious misunderstanding of the use and
purpose of MX records.  Although what you suggest may be a useful
extension of the current usage of MX records, it is not what MX records
were intended to do, much less "required" by anything short than a full
MTA.

     I also suggest that if you have a problem of the magnitude that you
claim, that you need to consider other mechanisms of addressing it, such
as a dedicated machine whose sole purpose is to accept incoming SMTP from
clients such as Pine, Netscape, Eudora, etc. as opposed to accepting email
from the net.  An MX record implementation would solve the "can't post to
the known SMTP servers" problem, but it won't solve the severe performance
problems that you will entail in trying multiple servers.  MX hunts are
for programs, not for user interfaces with real-time performance needs.

     Your request, in effect, is that Pine incorporate an MTA.  We will
consider this suggestion, but frankly, there are higher priority items on
our task list.

	I need a version of PINE that may access NT accounts.

	My mail server is EMWAC 0.8. It has POP3

	NT server can also be accessed by telnet.

	So I have 2 solutions:

		1) A version of PINE that will work on DOS and access NT  via 
LAN		
		2) A version of PINE that will work on NT character mode


	Can anyone tell me how to do it and what version are available ?

	Please email me at: Vasile@dante.cs.pub.ro

Using stand-alone Pico 2.7 under linux, with SPELL environment set to 
ispell.  When I check spelling (^T) all I get is a list of possible 
arguments to ispell and a list of commands.  It's the same thing you get 
if you call ispell without a file name.  Looks like Pico is calling 
ispell, but not telling it what to check.  Any ideas?

Try pc-pine for windows. You can get it at ftp.cac.washington.edu. Search
for the file pcp_w32.zip.
Telnet is not necessary.

Gerhard,
Current PC-Pine requires an IMAP server.  These exist for NT, but EMWAC
doesn't support IMAP to my knowledge.

Hi,

I've encountered the following problem with pine 3.93 (running on
SunOS): when I try to select some text in folder listing, using the
semicolon command, pine complains "Command ";" not defined for this
screen. Use ? for help". In help, this command is listed, however.

I was looking in comp.mail.pine, but it seems that nobody has
encountered this problem, at least in the recent postings.

Thanks for any help.

There is no single place where all commands are processed.  Where

reasonable to have a domain called smtpserver.something that is intended
to be an outgoing SMTP server for random Netscapes, Pines, and other
mailers.  It would also be reasonable for smtpserver.something to have an
MX record pointing somewhere else so that mail sent to
somebody@smtpserver.something gets routed to a host that accepts incoming
mail instead of going to smtpserver where there are no users and no
logins.

We agree on this.

You can have more than one smtp-server in the list, but I think you
already knew that.

We're not trying to skirt sendmail, we're just trying to give it to a
sendmail (or other smtp server) so that that MTA can handle the routing
for us.  If we were really trying to skirt sendmail we wouldn't deliver to
smtp-server, we would look up the MX of the recipients of the message and
try to deliver directly to them.  But we're not trying to deliver it,
we're just trying to pass it off to some MTA to deliver it for us.

Instead of changing thousands of PCs, how about using some indirection in
DNS?  For example, you could define smtpserver1, smtpserver2, ... to be
CNAMEs pointing to whatever servers you wanted.  If all the PCs were
configured to use those names, you'd only have to change those DNS entries
to cause a change to happen on the thousands of PCs.

ok... let me clarify....

Supercite lets you cite parts of messages you're replying to, in hairy ways.
"Supercite" is a GNU Emacs package written entirely in
Emacs Lisp. It interfaces to most of the commonly used Emacs mail user
agents ("MUAs") and news user agents ("NUAs"), and provides
sophisticated facilities for the citing and attributing of message
replies.  

Ask any gnu emacs guru...u bet he ll know. What i meant was is there
any going to be any such similar feature in future releases of pine.

    Did you specifically turn on enable-aggregate-command-set in your
Pine configuration?  In older versions of Pine, ';' did not seem to
appear in the Help screens unless it was specifically enabled, but I
don't know about 3.93, as I have had it enabled for a long time.

    However, I am a little puzzled by what you mean when you say
"select some text in folder listing," because a folder listing is just
that: an index listing which does not show the texts of articles
within the folder.  As far as I know, ';' does not work with text
portions of articles but with articles as whole entities.

Ok, I cannot post to a newsgroup from pine.
Here is what happens.



I type

        alt.test

in the "to:" field of pine.

I press the <Enter> key.

Then...

         alt.test@wco.com


appears in that same field.  The
final result is that pine gets
mad at me and says...

    [Mail not sent: <alt.test@wco.com>... User unknown]



in the .pinerc file thiere are these two lines...

-----------------------snip--begin--here-------------------------

# Sets domain part of From: and local addresses in outgoing mail.
user-domain=

-----------------------snip--end--here---------------------------


So I set it to...


        user-domain=ssnShirt.com

Then I try to post to alt.test, and instead of


        alt.test@wco.com


appearing in the "to:" field as it did when the field
was empty, I get


        alt.test@ssnShirt.com


appearing in the "To:" field.  Therefore, I must be
disobeying the 847th commandment carved in some unix
tablets which were given upon the mountain.

So I took the line out.  The machine behaved the exact
same as it did before.


I really don't care if the name of the program is PINE,
nn, tin, MyGrandmother, or what.

What I want to do is to post usenet News messages with
the string "danbury@ssnShirt.com" (no quotes) in the
"from:" and "reply-to:" fields of the message header.


Question: what magic word(s) do I place in what magic
field(s) of what magic file(s) located in what magic
place(s) so that "danbury@ssnShirt.com" (no quotes)
will appear in the "From:" and "Reply To:" fields of
usenet posted messages ?

Thanks
Clint
danbury@ssnShirt.com

Go to the Setup Configuration screen (S then C from the Main Menu) and
select the "enable-aggregate-command-set" option (or something with a name

Hi All!

I have a question regarding forwarding mail.  I worked for a company and 
used the server there.  Now I am back at school and my mail is forwarded 
(.forward file in user directory) to my new account.  It works fine.

The question is if my old company has to pay for any traffic that is 
produced by people trying to send mail to my old account.  The internet 
provider charges the company be the transmitted amount of information.  
Is the mail first completely sent to my old address and then forwarded or 
directly forwarded to my new account?

Thank you very much for your help in advance!

-Frank

Have you tried using 'su -' instead of 'su' so that your environment
doesn't get propagated to the new shell.  But maybe you're su-ing
because you DO want to propagate your environment such as $PWD.

In that case you could alias pine to
if [ `whoami` != "root" ] ; then pine ; fi

to prevent yourself from running pine whne you're on as root.

I have heard that there are services where a person may send email, and 
it will then be forwarded to a phone with a fax machine on the line. And 
I wonder if it is available in the other direction? I am especially 
interested in sending a fax to Madras state in India, if anyone has any 
ideas. Thanks for any leads.
Bye for now,

Here are some comments on v.3.92

-nice work.
-the screen does not seem to refresh very well when the window is reduced
and then maximized.  But I cannot replicate this 'bug' systematically.
-I usually keep a small window open at the bottom of my screen with
PCPINE, so I can see who writes to me and decide whether to read the
mail or not.
In 3.91, when the window was reduced to the minimum, you could still see
the name of the senders.  Now you don't anymore: I just see the first
initial.
- it would be great to be able to use CTRL-c, -V and -X in PCPINE like in
any window program.

Subject: Problem installing IMAP on Solaris 2.4
Message-Id: <Dr7IM2.5M0@midway.uchicago.edu>
Date: Fri, 10 May 1996 20:37:14 GMT

Hi,
        I tried to install IMAP from U. of Washington. The package
compiled fine and I put "imapd", "ipop2d", and "ipop3d" into the
/usr/sbin/ directory. The POP3 still works fine, but I cannot
get IMAP to work.
        I added the entry to /etc/services as the following:
pop             109/tcp                         # Post Office
pop3            110/tcp         postoffice      # Post Office
imap            143/tcp
 
        And the /etc/inetd.conf has the following lines:
pop     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/ipop2d        ipop2d
pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/ipop3d        ipop3d
imapd   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/imapd         imapd
 
        If I telnet to port 110 (pop3d), it works as expected:

I've been using Pine on a Sun machine for sometime and just discovered
PC-Pine and imap so I can get to stuff easily from home.

My question is how can I setup pcpine to access the .addressbook file on
my Sun home directory?  I tried setting the global addressbook entry to
"{myserver}.addressbook" but that shows an entry list and none of the
address nicknames work in Compose.  All the address are available when
running pine on the sun machine. 

I am able to access the Sun folders with {myserver}Mail/[] and obviously
my inbox works.  

Thanks for your suggestions.

    Here's your mistake RIGHT HERE.  When you use Pine to post to a
newsgroup, you do NOT put the name is the To: field, as you would with
email.  You put it in the Newsgroups: field, and if that field is not
showing, you press ^R (for "Rich Headers") to get it.  If you put the
nerwsgroups name in the To: field, Pine will treat it as if you are
trying to send email, not post to a newsgroup.  Use the correct header
field, or you will get garbage results, as you have already found out.

    Unix has nothing to do with it in this case.  It's learning
how to use Pine correctly in the first place to do basic tasks.

	After making your additions did you do a "ps" to find inetd and
then send it a "kill -HUP"?

 Okay, got that. Now what I want to do is check my mail from one account
 using PINE, then later go to my POP server from another account and 
 another computer and find it all still there for replying, filing, etc.

 So, how to I have PINE tell my POP server not to mark my mail received?

 TIA

Is there any way with Pine to (T)ake an address and save it directly to a 
distribution list?  I hate having to save the address to my address book 
then go into it and manually enter the address into the dist. list.  

Isn't there a way to save the address directly into the dist. list?

thanks,

	Sure.

	As you view the message with the address you want to add simply
type T(akeAddress).  When it asks you the "nickname" simply type the
name of the existing distribution list.  It will then ask you if you
want to replace the existing list or add to it.  I'll leave it to you
to select the appropriate answer.  :-) :-)

The problem is that you have "imapd" as the first word in the imap line of
/etc/inetd.conf.  It should be "imap", matching the service name.

HI,
  I have a problem here with PINE 3.92. In the sent-mail folder, I want to
see the names to whom the mail is sent, where only my name is displayed.
I searched thru the help but I couldn't find the answer. I will be very
happy if you would help me.

Ed,

I just tried this, but it didn't give me the option for adding.  Just 
replacing.  I'm using Pine 3.91, maybe you're using a newer version that 
has this option?  Or perhaps I need to set something in my config?  
(choices, choices.. sigh) :)

Thanks!
Joe

Yes, mails go to the first destination and are forwarded by that machine
to the second.  If you hate to waste computer/network resources, you 
should inform the senders to send all emails to your preferred account 
directly.

Hi:  ^C (control+c) cancels things you are composing, not things you have

Once you put a letter in the mailbox, it's gone unless you know the

kinda maybe, but your cancell message has to catch up with the post
message.  Hope that helps, if not repost or email me.  BYE.

This worked!  Thank you very much everyone who tried to help.
The solution is to deselect smart quoted in the preferences selection 
under the tools menu.

Once again thank you very much!

I am aware of an email to fax project that covers some parts of the 
globe.  You can learn all about it at www.tpc.int. (The Phone Company)

If you do not have WEB capability and cannot reach the project by other 
means, let me know and I will gather the info for you.

Robert

    One possibility is to use the alternate editor feature and use an
alternate editor which allows entering any of the 256 8-bit bytes. 
jpico, a configuration of the JOE editor, looks a lot like Pico and the
Pine composer but has a lot more capabilities and can supposedly take
whatever you give it.  (I am refering to the Un*x version of JOE/jpico
here.)

When I tried to send a uuencoded file using an older version of Pine
(3.92?), trailing blanks in each line got deleted, with the result
that the file was corrupt when uudecoded by the recipient (even though
in the Fcc, the blanks were preserved).

With Pine 3.93, this problem doesn't seem to be there.  But I'd like
to know if it's actually been fixed, so that I can confidently send
uuencoded files through Pine.

Thanks,

Ravi.

    To help you most effectively, we need more information.  What
operating system are you using Pine under -- Un*x, DOS, VMS, whatever? 
What is your terminal setup?  Are you using a PC or Mac with
communications software to dial into and login into a service provider? 
If so, what terminal emulation are you using -- VT52, ANSI, VT100,
something else?  All these factors can make a difference.  Therefore,
unfortunately, there simply is NO blanket answer to your question.

    *IF* you are using a PC/Mac to dial into a Un*x account, you might
look at two things: 1) your stty settings, particularly for 'erase';
and 2) the keybindings of your comm software, i.e., the actual codes
your comm software sends out when you press certain keys (which may not
necessarily be the same as what is on the keycaps).

    Other than this, I may not necessarily be able to help you, but if
you provide additional information, perhaps someone else can.

I've got a shell account as well as a PPP dialup account with my local ISP.  
I have been receiving my mail in my shell account, but recently decided to 
start getting my new mail through the POP-3 server on my dialup account by 
using a .forward file from the shell account.  

What I'd like to do now is get all my old mail from my shell account 
forwarded to my POP-3 mailbox ... I don't have the unix expertise, and thus 
my quesiton to the unix people out there ... What I'm interested in doing is 
keeping all the From, date, subject, etc fields the same when this is 
forwarded to my POP-3 account - I figure I'll need to parse out my .mailbox 
file and then use some mail command (perhaps the 'mail' command)to send to 
the POP-3 server.  Any ideas on how this could be accomplished?

Thanks in advance!

Paul,
Remote access to addressbooks is not yet available, unless you have
shared-filesystem access to the server.

The intent is to support CMU's "Application Configuration Access Protocol"
(ACAP) for this as soon as an implementation is available.

One option, if you have the time and software, would be to have your old
mailhost inform them for you. If that machine has procmail, or if you are
allowed to compile/install software on it, then you could do the following.
Use your .forward file to pipe the mail into procmail, and set up a
.procmailrc file that a) forwards the message to you, and b) sends a prepared
message to the originator of the mail, informing them of your address change.
Quite a major job if you don't already know how to do it, though.

I have found the answer to my own problem. By running PINE with -d 7 
debug option I discovered that PINE looks for UPPER CASE file type 
extensions when attaching a file; even when the file is in LOWER CASE in 
the windows pop-up box.

Hence, PINE was looking for a .TXT when the MIMETYPES file only lists 
txt So, I put both in, i.e. text/plain    txt TXT.

Simple.

On my VMS system, I had to issue

MAIL> SET FORWARD "smtp%""e-mailaddress"""

Note that I needed to enclose the e-mail address and smtp% prefix by double 
quotations, making the inside double quotations doubled.

Maybe my web page can help:

Instructions and script are provided for using PGP in Pine for sending
and displaying PGP signed/encrypted messages.  It is good for Pine 3.92

I remember reading about how to get Pine for VMS system.  It was written by 
someone in Israel or so but I couldn't get it or make it work at that time.  
Does anyone know about the situation now?

Well i hope there would be a SC for pine. It will give just one other 
reason for many people to switch over to pine. ..its not possible
to achieve the hairy effects of SC with the alternate editor
unfortunately :(... On the other hand the makers of pine could always
have a supercite option so that users could feel free to say no if
they didnt like it :-)

There's a lovely little program called 'mkpgp' that runs as an
alternate editor in pine and encrypts, decrypts (You have to
reply and then bring the message into the alternate editor to
decrypt) and signs very nicely. There's a link to it in the
cryptography software link on my web page.

	I'm currently using PINE 3.91 compilled on a VMS system and I'm having
a problem connecting to my news server.  I've used other programs like Netscape
Navigator which allow you to view mail in the same fashion.  Within netscape's
configuration, when it asked for nntp server, I simply put in my server's
domain name "gemini.tntech.edu" as instructed by a couple of the operations
guys around here.  They also told me that I "had to be within gemini's domain
in order to use it"...whatever that meant.  Well, it worked fine through
Netscape.  I assumed the nntp server would be the same for PINE.  In the setup
where it asks for nntp, I put in "gemini.tntech.edu".  Everytime I List the
folders it tells me "Can't connect to gemini.tntech.edu,119: connection
refused".  Does anyone know how to solve this problem?  I'd ask the sys ops
around here, but seeing as how its summer and all, no one is around.

Hmm - "www.greyfox.org" -> "A record not found, try again".
Does this host really exist - or is my DNS acting up again?

HI FOLKS!

Something strange's going on here.  When I use PINE to write to some email
address which does not correspond to a login account (or which is just a link
to such an account), I get some nasty error message like:

-------
/bin/sh: /usr/bin/uuname: No such file or directory Folder: INBOX  0 Messages
                                                   sendmail:
Markus.Rosenkranz@jk.uni-linz.ac.at ... deferred: (ERR_127) router
uucp_neighbors: command `/usr/bin/uuname' returned exit status EX_32256help
using Pine
                                       sendmail: mail moved to
/usr/spool/smail/error/0uHzWL-0001MGC MESSAGE
-------

Now the curious thing is that using the ancient unix mailer /bin/mail, it just
works out fine.  Can anyone figure out what the reason might be?

.......
Let me add some details.  Since I did not manage to configure the mysterious
IMAPD (where can I get some _brief_ instructions?) which always reports
"Connection refused", I installed a symbolic link via nfs to the machine I am
using as a mail server.  Thus /usr/spool/mail/marcus points to the
corresponding file at the remote host; "marcus" is my username on both.
(Actually the file on the remote host is by itself a link to the mailfile in
another directory; but this is only for security reasons.)  By this mechanism,
my machine thinks all mails coming to the remove server are actually local.  I
would prefer some less "tricky" way like IMAP, though, as I have already
pointed out.  In order to get replies on the right machine, I also set the
variable "user-domain" to that of my remote mail server.
I do not think these details will help you much, but one never knows.
.......

Thank you so much for any help.
Marcus.

I've been looking around for at least a year for a conversion utility which will import 
messages stored in a Pine folder into dbase, Foxpro, or Microsoft Access. No luck.

Pronto, an offline mail reader, downloads Pine folders and stores each message as a 
dbase record. But I would like a conversion utility.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I keep trying to hit "^C" to cancel something I've done, and the option is no
longer there! I have to look down the bottom of the screen and see that now I
either have to press "Y" or "N".  What's up with that? What was the reasoning
behind removing the  "cancel" options? I always used to  use "^C" rather than
"N" to cancel something. (I guess it just made more sense to me!)

	Ahhh....you managed to send this one....and it has a message ID
of:

	So, you sent it with pine.

	Your "BUG" report isn't very descriptive.  So, unless you care
elaborate there isn't much folks can do to help.

Since version 3.92, you are only permitted to do local modifications to
Pine. So you'll need to get an explicit permission from U of Washington
to get permission to distribute such a version.

FYI: Pine since version 3.92 is definitely not a GNU licenced program.
The last free Pine is version 3.91.

    Blame your DNS.  What are you running?  Shall we take this to
comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains and slug it out there, leaving
comp.mail.pine for discussion of Pine issues?

ObPine:  I am happy to report that 3.94 will function properly with
8BITMIME and texts in non-Latin languages, from the testing I have done
with the affected module.  Users in Greece, Russia, and so on should take
note and definitely upgrade when it becomes available.

I just got pine and I tried setting fcc-name-rule to current-folder.  I
go into a folder called "test" and I compose a message.  The "Fcc" field
is set to "test" as expected, but when I fill in the "To" field, the
"Fcc" field is reset to "sent-mail".  What's wrong?

Sorry, I really should have included that information in my original posting.

I'm using pine 3.91, on a Sun SPARC system running SunOS 4.1.3.

We use several types of terminal. But the keys behave in the same way on 
all of them. We use vt100 dumb terminals, PC's running Sun PC-NFS and 
using a vt100 emulation, and xterms under X-Windows. I have the TERM 
variable set to vt100 in all cases.

In my .login file I have :

stty erase '^h'
stty werase '^?'


- this seems to work correctly in the Unix shell.

I can't find anything about setting the delete key in the Pine 
documentation, except in the Pine Technical Notes there is the following 
reference:

 "^H is treated the same as the delete key, so the backspace or delete 
 keys always work regardless of any configuration. In an upcoming version, 
 there will be an option to have the delete key behave like ^D rather 
 than ^H".


I hope this gives you enough information.


Thanks in advance,

  Tim Porter.

I just noticed something a bit odd: all my sent-mail before 5/11 is now
showing the wrong destination. Specifically, "Gary Jones" is displayed
as the recipient for all saved Email. I did not notice this last

have the WWIS people done something that would explain this? Could I have

    Yes.  Make sure you have aggregate-command-set (whatever it's
called) enabled in your configuration (from the Main menu, take Setup
and Config).  Then just enter the sequence of commands from the Index
listing of the newsgroup:

        ; A A D X

(select, all, apply, delete, exclude/expunge).

    Unfortunately, your questions are a little ambiguous (at least to
me).  I'm not sure what you mean by the "message sent list," so it's
not clear what letters you're talking about.  When you refer to a
message "posted to the server," do you mean the server on your system
or the server on the recipient's system?  If you mean the latter, you
can set up a customized header in your configuration,
Return-Receipt-To: which some -- NOT ALL! -- servers will honor and
send you a receipt telling you, more or less, that your message got to
the recipient's server.  However, there is NO Internet-wide way to
determine when (or even whether) the message was opened and read by the
recipient.

I thought CMU had devised a protocol called IMSP for this kind of thing.
Does ACAP supercede IMSP?

Yes, ACAP is the successor to IMSP.

If you have access to the Unix shell, try invoking "pilot".  It should
exist in the same path as pine and pico.  The "dot" files (.plan, etc.)
are bracketed by #'s.

By accident I discovered that in Pine, when I read a file into a message 
I am composing, I also have the opportunity to delete files from my Unix 
directory or rename them. In fact, it is easier to do so in Pine than in 
Unix itself (for this Unix beginner who can't remember "rm").

The question: Is there no way to go to file management directly? Do I 
have to start composing a message, do my file managment, and then cancel 
the message (which had no other purpose than to get me into file management)?

Thanks in advance.

The faq.mbox says the script brk2pine.sh to convert berkeley alias files
to pine addressbook format is in "contrib/utils".  What machine is this?
What's the full path on that machine?

Also, is there a script to convert mmdf alias files to pine addressbook?

Egil,
Be careful...

It's true that 3.92 is "definitely not a GNU licenced program"... but in
fact, *no* version of Pine has *ever* been distributed by us under a GNU
license.  Nor could anyone else reasonably distribute a derivative work
under GPL since our copyright has always required inclusion of permission
statements that conflict with GPL.  That's been true since day one. 

Your statement "The last free pine is version 3.91" is subject to 
considerable debate... It depends a lot on what you mean by "free".
Consider:
 o No version of Pine has ever been completely free of conditions, 
   as in "public domain".
 o No version of Pine has ever been (so-called) "free" in the GNU 
   Public License sense, since none of the GPL restrictions have ever
   been asserted.
 o No version of Pine has ever been anything *other* than free in the
   sense that anyone can compile and execute Pine/Pico/Pilot for any
   purpose without paying anything to UW.

Cheers,

-teg

Since Wednesday, May 8, we have been unable to send messages to a
distribution list in "hspers" that we previously had no problem with.  I
asked our bank support group about it and they suggested to add "@u" to all
of the addresses that previously went out without it, rationalizing that
the new Pine had new configurations.  I started to do this,
then realized that we have another list, equally long, which has given us
no trouble in sending during the same time frame, despite that fact that
it doesn't have the "@u" tail.  Before I go ahead and add "@u." to this
rather long list, I'd like some input on why one list is fine and the
other isn't.  And advice on what we can do to make them both work smoothly.

When we do try to send to the problem list we get a message "unable to
send..." and the address shown is rather close to the top of the list.  I
believe all the addresses listed after this one aren't accepted.  In the
end, nothing is sent at all.  Very frustrating as the information we wish
to send should have gone out already...

Thank you.

Subject: Pico writeout won't prompt for filename

I'm noticing that unlike Pico 2.5, Pico 2.7 won't prompt me for
a filename during a ctrl-o "writeout".  It tries to save the file
under the name that was opened.  This is a major pain when I can't
write to the directory or don't want to overwrite the file in 
question -- I have no way of renaming the file and I have to exit
without saving.  What's up with that?

Just to confirm our phone call, the problem is almost certainly due to the
invalid address "dao" that you had in the hspers list.  By removing tht
and testing the address "amyd", you should be able to get the announcement
out.  Sorry for the delay in resolving this.

Is it correct that there is a PINE for Windows? Has it advantages over
programs like Eudora? Were can I get it?

Also, I am looking for a not-too-big Windows program that combines
mail and news. Any tips?

I've installed a `spell' command in /usr/bin as a one-line
shell script:

    /usr/bin/ispell -l

The -l option makes ispell work like ``real'' spell, and keeps programs
that expect that behavior happy. 

For pico, I would imagine you can also set the SPELL environment
variable to "ispell -l".

Egil Kvaleberg's statement (reproduced below) is not true, Richard
Stallman's rhetoric notwithstanding.

Anyone can modify any version of Pine.  We request that anyone doing such
modifications also modify the version number by appending an "L" suffix
(e.g. "3.93" would become "3.93L") so that when we get bug reports, we
know that it is from a modified version of Pine.  Any entity, except a
for-profit entity, can distribute any version of Pine. 

Any for-profit entity that wishes to distribute Pine must ask permission
from the University of Washington.  In other words, if Microsoft wishes to
produce Microsoft Pine for Windows, they need to talk to UW's lawyers. 
The issue here is that if UW does not protect the "Pine" name, it will
lose its rights to that name.  It's possible that UW may issue blanket
permission for such things as freeware CD-ROM distributions of unmodified
Pine. 

Unlike GNU, there is no requirement about source distribution.  GNU tries
to dictate your morality.  We do not.  Nor have we ever, to date, refused
permission to anyone who asks.

Personally, I find GNU's "copyleft" to be much more restrictive; it
prevents anyone from using software under the "copyleft" in a proprietary
program.  This is why the IMAP toolkit is not under the "copyleft" either. 
[The IMAP toolkit does not have any distribution restrictions at all;
for-profit organizations are encouraged to make unlimited use of it.]

Since Mr. Brand seems to be at a university, there should be no problem
with his distributing a French translation of Pine.  We would appreciate
receiving a copy of his modifications, so that we can incorporate them
into future versions.  But he's under no obligation to do so.

You can re-compile Pine with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM defined in
pine/osdep/os-???.h.  This will allow you to set the From: address in
the customized-hdrs entry in the Setup/Config screen.

You can select the include-attachments-in-reply feature in the
Setup/Config screen.  Then you can delete the attachments you don't
want to send in the composer...

Your logon is likely to stay as ritschr, but that's OK - my login is 
bm11455.  The userid's aren't needed to be the name.

The "real name" field, though, on your post shows as "Dr. Ronald L. Ritsch".
Assuming that's the field limit, if you scrap the "L. ", you'll get 3 more
characters to stick at the end, giving you room for "ard".

Check with your local sysadmin to see how they would prefer you do that.

Jason

PS: You're using Pine3.91 - you may want to advise them to upgrade to the
newer version of Pine while you're rattling their chains. :)  -J-

Ah...glad someone mentioned spell-check.  Can't help the above person, 
but was wondering what to do if one's checker does not work at all?  My 
ISP won't fix it.  Can I import a fresh checker file to replace the 
corrupted one, or does the ISP absolutely have to be the one to fix the 
thing system-wide?

We have recently obtained a Silicon Graphics Power Challenge with 4 R8000
processors.  The command uname -a gives:
   IRIX64 marvin 6.1 07121823 IP21 mips

I have been trying:
   build sgi
This gives an unusually large number of (scary) compilation warning
messages.  It is also unable to find libsun.a when building pico.

Is it stupid to use "build sgi" for this kind of SGI machine?
Has anyone got this to work for this kind of SGI machine?
Thanks.

In versions 3.92 and 3.93 you can set the
`compose-maps-delete-key-to-ctrl-d' option to get required behavour.

Vladimir,

Thanks for your mail.

Do you know where can I get Pine version 3.92 or 3.93 for SunOS?

I've never claimed that, either. As we all know, the GNU license is more
restrictive than e.g. Pine 3.91 in order to ensure that the software
remains *free*. A scheme without such restrictions, like the one used for
Pine 3.91, has some built in dangers that others may impose severe
restrictions on derived works.

I definitely think not. The only restriction you have imposed on the Pine
3.91 software is that the U of W copyright notice remains intact, and the
the name U of W is not used for advertising. Other that that, the software
can be used for *any purpose*.

Obviously, the U of W cannot claim copyright to modifications that are
done by other parties. 

So anyone can grab the 3.91 Pine, make modifications to it (however small,
really), claim copyright to the modifications, and impose any restrictions
on this derived work as he pleases. The only restriction is that he
doesn't claim copyright to the parts of the code that U of W wrote, and
that he displays the U of W copyright message. The parts of the derived
work that come from the original Pine code would remain free, as such, but
that doesn't matter. 

The GNU terms are designed to prevent such incidents, and ensure that 
software remains free.

A few examples of what I mean:

Your excellent Imapd package is distributed under essentially the same
terms as Pine 3.91, and in this case you actually encourage people using
it for derived work. On which they can impose whatever restriction they 
want.

Or consider that your Pine 3.93 could be regarded as a derivate version
of Elm (in the historical sense at least, I know that only faint traces 
of the code actually remains). You are free to impose any restrictions 
that you desire on the derived work.

Full "public domain" is not necessarily a good way of distributing free
software. And it is definitely *not* a requirement for using the term
"free". Nor is GNU terms, for that sake. Free software involves freedom to
use, modify *and* distribute. Under which 3.91 qualifies, and 3.92 does 
not. As simple as that.

Is there any way in which a message can "fall through the cracks" with the 
combination described above? I have seen thngs in the queue that then 
never arrive. Deliver thinks it's delivered, but they aren't there. Could 
it be locking on the mailbox/inbox? For a local host, should I be using 
IMAP or just letting PINE access /var/spool/mail/user directly? Would 
that make a difference?

Thanks,

Ben

Is there an X-Windows version of pine?  If so, what is it called, and
where can I get it?  If there is no graphical pine, is there something
similar?  We are looking to adopt a new standard mail program at our cite.
Pine is great for the terminal users, but our X users will want a GUI
interface.  Any help or suggestions is appreciated.

I recall hearing rumor about X-Window pine a few months back, but I had
forgotten about it until now.

I really think this should be made clearer. My interpretation was that
local modifications was to remain local.

Anyway, it doesn't help me, because since I am an independant consultant 
devoting some of my time to free software I'm by definition a for-profit 
entity. The same restriction would go for any company contributing 
to the maintenance of free software.

The GNU terms and restrictions are made to ensure that the software remains 
*free*.

    Hi... this may be a simple question, but I don't know where the FAQ
   would be....
   I've seen an e-mail, composed with pine, where part of the text 
    was blinking on and off... and I've never heard of this before.
     Any of you experts out there know how it's done?
      Thanks in advance 
                        - 
                          Denis.

I would have guessed that a 'build sol' would be one of the most straight
forward builds of pine out there, ...but no.  This is Solaris2.5.  It
splatters all over the place... see below. 

Any tips?

And you don't really need to do the `X'.  If you just do:

  ; A A D

The messages will be excluded/expunged once you exit pine.

Good luck,

If you have GCC installed, use "build gso" instead of "build sol".

The problem with the sol build is that it is difficult to refer to a
compiler which will generate working binaries in any portable way.  The
Solaris development environment, to put it charitably, is not condusive
for the development of portable software.  There is another horror story
involving SUN's Seattle office and license keys that I'd rather not go
into. 

I can not, in good conscience, recommend the Solaris development
environment to anyone.  Get gcc and use it instead.  The only reason why
we have a separate "gso" port instead of making it be the "sol"  port is
that there are a few benighted sites which still don't have gcc. 

Pine on Solaris is SVR4, but on many Solaris systems, "cc" will give you
the BSD C compiler with BSD libraries (/usr/ucb/cc).  This mostly works,
but readdir()  will return the BSD structure instead of the SVR4
structure, and the file name is offset by 2 octets between the two.  The
end result is that in file listings, the first two characters are cut off.

"ucbcc" runs the BSD C compiler with SVR4 libraries (/usr/ccs/bin/ucbcc),
which will generate good code.  This is what we use when we do "build sol" 
on our site. 

The real SVR4 C compiler is hidden away, typically with some name such as
/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc but even that is variable. 

"ucbcc" was chosen as a wretched compromise.  It builds good code.  You
can get the real SVR4 C compiler to work as well, with a few hacks to the
code.

You can avoid all this insanity by using gcc and the gso port.

Subject: Dist. Lists in Pine
Date: 14 May 1996 12:12:56 -0700
Message-Id: <4nalvo$iag@crl3.crl.com>

I'm using Pine 3.91.  Is there a way to take an address from a piece of 
email and automatically put it into a dist. list?  I've been having to 
take the address from the email, put it into my address book, and then 
manually enter the address (or use the nickname if I also want to leave 
the entry in my address book) into the dist. list.  Any ideas?

Thanks,
Joe DeRouen

Pine 3.91 had a bug such that you had to select the message (;) and
(A)pply (T)akeAddr to get it into a list.  The current Pine 3.93
release doesn't have that problem...

I've built pine3.92 under Solaris2.5 after making a few changes.
There are a few tips and tricks but it isn't very difficult....even if
you don't have the /usr/ucb stuff installed.  I don't and it worked fine.

BTW, I'm not a C programmer by any stretch.  I also fail to "document"
things....so if this doesn't work for you the first time around let me
know and maybe we can find the missing step.

Also, if you have documentaion on your Solaris compiler it may be useful
to read it.  There is a SPARCompiler - C Programmer's Guide that comes
in handy.  Almost as handy as the pine documentation.  :-)

First for the Tips:

1.	Type "which cc".  You should come up with something along the
	lines of "/usr/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc".

	If you get "/usr/ucb/cc" then fix your PATH so that /usr/ucb
	comes after "/usr/opt/SUNWspro/bin" or wherever else the Admin
	may have installed/hid it.

2.	Check to make sure you don't have /usr/ucbinclude in
	your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  Mine is simply
	set to /usr/opt/SUNWspro/lib:/usr/openwin/lib.

Now for the changes (This is where I may forget somthing...):

1.	In the file imap/non-ANSI/c-client/Makefile:

	Near the line starting with "sol" change:

	$(MAKE) mtest OS=$@ EXTRADRIVERS="$(EXTRADRIVERS)" CC=ucbcc \

	to

	$(MAKE) mtest OS=$@ EXTRADRIVERS="$(EXTRADRIVERS)" CC=cc \

	Also find the line reading:

	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o mtest mtest.o $(ARCHIVE) $(LDFLAGS)

	and change it to:

	$(CC) -o mtest mtest.o $(ARCHIVE) $(LDFLAGS)

2.	In the imap/non-ANSI/imapd/Makefile.

	Change:

	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o imapd imapd.o $(LDFLAGS)

	to

	$(CC) -o imapd imapd.o $(LDFLAGS)

3.	In the imap/non-ANSI/ipopd/Makefile.

	Change:

	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o ipop2d ipop2d.o $(LDFLAGS)

	to:

	$(CC) -o ipop2d ipop2d.o $(LDFLAGS)

	AND

	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o ipop3d ipop3d.o $(LDFLAGS)

	to:

	$(CC) -o ipop3d ipop3d.o $(LDFLAGS)

4.	In the pico directory.....

	Try using the cc5.sol file that I've attached instead of the
	one supplied.


	I think that is about all I had to do......

	Let me know if you have troubles....

	Regards,

		Ed

We have Pine 3.93. T(akeAddress) allows you to Add/append to a list. I
tried but wasn't able to add/append to a list in Pine 3.91.

Hello

We are using pc-pine on pc's configured with Beam & Whiteside PC-NFS
The b&w is installed under dos an the nfs drives are available under 
windows where the b&w winsock.dll is supported.
Currentley we are usin pc-pine for windows and this workes perfect.
Now I would like to install the dos version of pc pine but cannot seem to 
get it working.
I have tried the version for PC-TCP/IP and the pc/NFS Version.
Included in B&w are 2 tsr's to simulate the other TCP/IP stacks from
sun and ftp.
The pine software loads but after configuration he gives me the error 
HOST NOT FOUND.
This doesn't change when I use the IP address instead of its name.

Here is the example of the configuration file

personal-name=D Schokkaert
user-id=admin2
user-domain=MAREEN01
smtp-server=MAREEN01
nntp-server=
inbox-path={MAREEN01}inbox


Is there anybody who can help me ???

Why would you do that?  I can't remember any precise example right now,
but there are a few important other things for which /etc/passwd should 
be readable.  For example changing directories using the cd ~<username> 
syntax, probably for the finger command, talk?, other mail applications...

In case your aim is to hide the encoded passwords, so that an attack with
crack or similar programs won't be possible, you should enable password
shadowing, which unfortunately is still not the default in all UNIX Versions.

Read about it in the machine's documentation, or type "man shadow" for
more info.

In any case, inform yourself very well on the possible consequences of 
taking away the read permission for others (and group).

All the best,

I think the build environment provided in the pine source is the REAL problem 
here, not solaris - 

If you just have your path set properly, with the path to the compiler 
as part of your path, you can merrily  go through ALL the make files and
change them so CC is cc and everything builds just fine.

If the working environment on your computer is set up right - that is,
with /opt/SUNWspro/bin in your path (or wherever you put the compiler) then
all this ucbcc stuff just keeps the make from working.

Neal,

Go into Edit-Preferences-Session (this is with NCSA Telnet 2.7b -
technically a beta version, but very stable: we have it in wide spread
prodcution use) and change the values for the telnet interrupt key, just
backspace over the definition. By default it is set for to be ^C which
Pine wants to use for cancel.

Hi, pine users!

I try to supress Fcc for some addresses (examples are some mail
archives/robots; I don't want to klog disk with copies of requests).

It doesn't work :-( If I leave  Fcc field in address book entry for a
address empty, I get default Fcc as user-name.

If I try to set it to "" (two double-qoutes), I get "" as Fcc when
composing.

Yes, I can always delete Fcc when composing new message - so it is not the
point. The point is, how to *not* be prompted with Fcc at all.

Do I miss something, or is it a bug?

BTW fcc-name-rule is set to "by-recipient" 

greetings

Quite a lot of my mail works well with the US-ASCII character set. But 
more and more messages use iso-8859-1 character set. Is there a toggle 
within Pine to switch between different character sets? Or can one be 
created. Thanks for any information. Bye for now,

In pine 3.91, I can use Thai language to compose message,
but I cann't do it in pine3.93 (or even pine3.92 ).
Does pine3.93 not support 8 bit message anymore ?
Or how can I do if I want to use pine with 8 bit Ascii message?
Any suggestion would be highly appreciated,

Thanks,
Suwat P.

What about a French translation of the documentation (Getting started with 
Pine) of PINE 3.91? Some of the students of the University of Geneva use Pine 
on a VMS machine. I have a copy of "Getting started with Pine 3.91" but in 
English and I know it's very complicated for a student who only has the basic 
knowledge in Computers to understand all those docs, manuals, user's guide in 
a foreign language, i.e. in English for most of them.
I don't want to translate the whole program of PINE (anyway, I could'nt), only 
a short and simple user's guide in French. But first I'd like to know if there 
is someone who has already had the same idea, so that we can help each other 
and not do the same work twice.

Hmm. Did you read the e-mail with netscape's mail-program?

If so, the mail might have looked like this in an ordinary mail-program
such pine:

<BLINK>the text that blinked</BLINK>

When netscape's mail-program sees that, it presents it as with an ordinary
html-file.

Didn't think of it.  3.94 will interpret "" in the Fcc field in the
address book to mean no fcc.  Thanks for the suggestion.

^J does the same thing in jpico that it does in pico.  I.E., 'format' means
'format paragraph'.  You just hit ^J on the paragraph you want justified.
Note that you can set the right margin (or "fill column") with ESC ESC R.

There are no man pages for the current version of jpico.  They'll be there
in the next version.  It going to be a while before its out though.  I'm not
going to have time to work on JOE until the summer.

Hello,

All our mails are arriving on one machine, the mail server. This means
that at any time about 20 pine processes are running.

Some users have the bad habit of keeping all their mails in the INBOX. In
some cases they have up to 500 mails !! This means that our
/usr/spool/mail is always full (currently 30 Mb) and that they use up a
lot of memory on the mail server (about 20 Mb). It is not a real problem
but it is a waste of the common resources on the system. 

I was wondering if there was not a way around this. Would it be possible
for instance to force a save on some folder in the user domain as he quits
from pine ? Or save all messages from the past month (or week) in a
separate folder as is done for sent-mail ? 

There is always the possibility of explaining to people the advantage of
sorting their mail and so on, but I have given up on this solution !!

	Thanks for any advice you can give

		Jan

I have an IBM PS/1 and use Qmodem to connect to our school's computer
system; currently the program is set to emulate VT-100. Today we got 
the Pine 3.93 update; I think we were using 3.92 before. My problem is
that whenever I quit pine, my terminal height has been reset from 24 to
25. Whenever I execute a command, the 25th line- in Qmodem, the status
bar- currently mine reads :
VT100  ONLINE  38400 8N1  [HOME]=Menu   FDX 8 LF X     CP LG    PR 

This is quite annoying; however, I can get around the problem by resetting
my terminal (^G-3 for the curious). I e-mailed my sysadmin, his only help
was to suggest looking in Pine's set-up on the main menu (no help there
that I could find).

Is there some way to fix this problem? Please e-mail your reply, whether
is is something like 'live with it' or 'recompile the program,
uncommenting line X in file Z.'

Thanks for your help-

We are also plannig to use Pine in our system. As far as I understand,
it is impossible to reply decnet mail with VMS Pine. Is there a
workaround for that, for example somehow forcing all mail to be
internet-mail (even when sent from VMS-MAIL program)?

Thank you very much for that tip.

One thing I observe now that mousing is enabled is that the rationale for
organizing the menu bar changes.  It is currently does not list Index on
the first screen, presumably since that is such a common and obviously named
operation that no one needs the reminder.

Now that point-and-click is an option, common operations such as Index are
considerably more valuable on menubar #1 as opposed to #2.  I may simply
switch MainMenu and Index for our installation, but I thought I'd raise the
issue as it seems to be a systemic consideration.

Is there any reasonable way to extract all mail messages to ascii text
without selecting individual messages.  Even the ability to do it with a
single folder without the select etc. stuff would help some.  I have need
of keeping a lot of records and have no guarantee of having access to Pine
in the near future ( I can always just gzip the whole directory structure
if I did).
	I really do not care about the file size or organization as long
as the info was retrievable.  Thanks for any suggestions.

With the installation of 3.93 here, we find several stuck pine
processes per day.  We have finally reproduced the problem, and found
a puzzling section of code that causes it.

To reproduce it, I open a telnet session to our SunOS host and run
pine.  I mark a message deleted.  I use Q to quit and when pine asks
whether I want to quit I type Y.  Then I close the telnet session
*giving no answer to the next prompt* which is the one about whether to
expunge the deleted messages, and not logging out either.

This leaves pine doing goodnight_gracey and waiting for the answer to
the expunge question.  We notice that pine ignores HUP at this point,
which is why the pine session does not close :

pine.c

    /* committed to exiting so become unreceptive to HUP */
    end_sighup();

    /* clean up open streams */
    if(pine_state->mail_stream)
      expunge_and_close(pine_state->mail_stream, pine_state->context_current,
                        pine_state->cur_folder,
                        (!pine_state->inbox_stream || cur_is_inbox)
                          ? &final_msg : NULL);


so it looks like this with gdb :

#0  0xef789010 in select ()
#1  0xe012c in check_for_timeout (time_out=600) at ttyin.c:708
#2  0xe0574 in read_char (time_out=600) at ttyin.c:835
#3  0xd910c in radio_buttons (
    prompt=0x22bb98 "Expunge the 2 deleted messages from \"INBOX\"? ",
    line=-3, esc_list=0x1f5960, dflt=121, on_ctrl_C=0, help_text=0x0, flags=0)
    at status.c:1082
#4  0xd87e4 in want_to (
    question=0xeffff238 "Expunge the 2 deleted messages from \"INBOX\"",
    dflt=121, on_ctrl_C=0, help=0x0, display_help=0, flush=0) at status.c:864
#5  0x7666c in expunge_and_close (stream=0x214b70, context=0x214088,
    folder=0x21281c "INBOX", final_msg=0xeffff404) at mailcmd.c:3880
#6  0xb5b3c in goodnight_gracey (pine_state=0x212790, exit_val=0)
    at pine.c:2146
#7  0xb5a70 in quit_screen (pine_state=0x212790) at pine.c:2112
#8  0xb2968 in main (argc=1, argv=0xeffffb64) at pine.c:866



Ultimately it starts checking for new mail again because it is idle,
but it never quits.

We suggest that expunge_and_close needs to see HUP and do a safe
default action (save without expunging for example) and close up.


Can we get an official fix for this?  Isn't this a problem everywhere?

Note, our version is 3.93L as suggested for locally modified versions,
but none of the functions called here have been changed.

Pine3.93 supports 8 bit message but character-set in pine setup need
to be set.  I'll forward you instructions on setting it up for Thai
language shortly.

3.  For more advanced Macintosh computer users: compressed attached

      ~133K.  Can be decompressed by any Macintosh computer user; no
     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed.  You
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as 
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut 
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in 
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be 
     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with

     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your

Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Jennie Bell and I recently started using a magazine subscription
club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal with your
first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They have over
1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a
subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they more of a
selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for most every
area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of
what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people buy
magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes or
hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to make
it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper than all
their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the publishers
themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half their business
comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new members who only speak
limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.  I
don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are less
than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other times,
just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.  They
assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.  

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from a
special list of over 270 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.  

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a charge
for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie subs) that
varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be very
friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change when I
moved from one country to another.
 
The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls you
personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes he has
one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he insists on
setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't
want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future orders (after your
first order) via E-mail.   

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas, he
will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he still
makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long distance
rates are cheaper then.  

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had a
2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they could
join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately when you
call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new members  the
same day or within a few days now, as they have increased their staff.  I am
not sure about this.........but if you email the above form to them, that is
the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what he
sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Jennie Bell

Thanks!  I read the whole config menu and even did a search for the word
"Select"--but never realized I was looking for "aggregate command set".

:     However, I am a little puzzled by what you mean when you say
: "select some text in folder listing," because a folder listing is just
: that: an index listing which does not show the texts of articles
: within the folder.  As far as I know, ';' does not work with text
: portions of articles but with articles as whole entities.

That's one of the coolest features about the pine mail-reader.  If you've
got hundreds of messages saved in a folder that need searching, you can
type ; - select   t - text    a - all, and it will search the messages for
any which contain that text string (in all parts of the message, including
the body.)

Subject: How to use PageDown/PageUp in xterm
Date: 15 May 1996 21:50:17 +0200
Message-Id: <4ndchp$5ps@spinnaker.rhein.de>

Hi!

I wonder wheather it is possible to use the PageUp (Prior) and
PageDown (Next) keys with pine in a xterm.

On my linux console it is no problem to use these keys and other
programs (e.g. tin) can use the keys in a xterm without problems, but
pine doen't :-(
I have the same problems with my old XT connected to the linux box
with ethernet and ncsa telnet.

PgUp sends ESC[5~ PgDown sends ESC[6~

So I get only get the message "Command "~" not defined for this screen."

How can I get these keys working?

I use Linux with XFree86 3.1.2D (X11R6.1) and its xterm (since 3.1.2D
color version, but the problem appeared in older versions too).

pine 3.93, but 3.92 and 3.91 also had this problem.

Ciao

        Roland

The Midnight Commander is a so called clone of the famous Norton Commander
so widely used on DOS PC's. Although the MC resembles so much NC it is by
far superior to it. MC is distributed under the GNU Public License and the
best filemanager on the UNIX/Linux world so far IMHO.

Look at "http://stekt.oulu.fi/~jtklehto/mc" for more information.

Hello. (Thought I would say hi first.)  I don't know about using pinefor
all of this but the editor be it vi or pico or whatever, can certainly help
out.  In VI could programa  key to do that, but I am gonna bet you are
using pico, so if it were me, I would create a file with the always
included information, and simply include the file into the mail after I
respond.  That way it would have no >'s before it.  The only problem is
that you will still have the copy that was sent to you with one set of >'s
before it.  But deleting those lines has to be easier then deleting those
>'s on every line.  

Another thing, I was thinking why would I have to include anything over and
over agian, if it is the same they already know what it says, but if you
are taling about the chess board, which is the same excepte for the one
piece you move, or such, then the include file would be great, except you
would need to update it after each move.  Anyway, you can think that all
through yourself.  But PINE cannot remove the >'s in some of the reply and
not other parts, that I can tell you and as for simply not having them, if
it is there it is REAL obscure, because I have never seen it.

Hope I am helping,

Okay, this is all very simple.  The folder is in fact a file.  And it is a
file of the same name as the folder.  So if your folder is games, the file
name is games.  But it is ina directory.  The directry is probably called
Mail or something like that.  Go into that directory and get the files you
want. 
  As for going to MS-word, after you down load it they should work in
MS-word just fine.  With the fiolder file though all of the mail will be in
one file, it will just be one message after the next, seperating it out
could be fun.  :)

I just figured out what my problem was (and still is).  ^J
doesn't work when I'm using Delrina WinComm to dial in to my ISP.
In pico you can use either `ESC ESC J' or `CTL J' to justify.  In
jpico it seems that only `CTL J' will justify.  Is there any
magic key combination to justify in jpico for those of us who
can't produce a `CTL J'?  Note that with some of my other
terminal programs I am able to produce a `CTL J' so I was able to
verify that `CTL J' does work in the jpico at my ISP.

Thanks,
Nancy

Hi.  I'd really appreciate any advice anyone can give me.  I am a newbie, 
and would like to know how to download Pine folders (e.g. "Sent mail 
Aug-95" and "INBOX") onto my hard drive.  I know how to download 
individual files (E for Export, then I use the downloading feature on my 
service provider's menu), but I am hoping there is a more convenient way 
to get, say, a folder with 200 messages onto a disk.

My final goal, incidentally, is to have all my sent and received mail in 
the form of MS Word documents.

If anyone actually has the patience to answer this question, please do so 
in the simplest terms--any unexplained use of technical language 
will lose me.  I'm very grateful for any help.

Yours sincerely,

David Murrell

One of our HPUX sites has this problem also. Pine locked up on me with an 
18K message. You have to kill the Pine process to recover. Right? Did you
ever get an answer to your post?

Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Shyamala Krishnamurty and I recently started using a magazine
subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal
with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They
have over 1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a
subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they more of a
selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for most every
area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of
what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people buy
magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes or
hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to make
it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper than all
their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the publishers
themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half their business
comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new members who only speak
limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.  I
don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are less
than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other times,
just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.  They
assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.  

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from a
special list of over 270 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.  

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a charge
for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie subs) that
varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be very
friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change when I
moved from one country to another.
 
The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls you
personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes he has
one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he insists on
setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't
want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future orders (after your
first order) via E-mail.   

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas, he
will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he still
makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long distance
rates are cheaper then.  

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had a
2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they could
join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately when you
call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new members  the
same day or within a few days now, as they have increased their staff.  I am
not sure about this.........but if you email the above form to them, that is
the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what he
sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Shyamala Krishnamurty

The above mentioned address is I think correct by the RFCs, but pine
doesn't somehow understand them (Error in To: filed, addresses beginning
with a @ don't get to reply etc). Don't you think it should?

Further information on this particular problem! We are running a cluster of SGI
Indys, with one acting as the local mailhost. All the workstations should throw
mail at the mailhost without From: headers, which will be inserted by the
mailhost as part of the forwarding.

Mail then goes to a departmental mail server, which aliases the
username%mailhost@eng.ox.ac.uk address to become a
firstname.lastname@eng.ox.ac.uk (the first is source routed for a start, which
doesn't comply with the RFCs, whilst the aliased name is neater and more
convenienct, since it allows for users to change where they receive their
mail).

So, the question remains: how do I stop Pine (v3.89 - where can I get a
compiled copy of v3.9 for Irix 5x?) putting From: headers on the messages?

This is a problem with pine 3.93 - there's a patch that may fix it
that's floated through this newsgroup before.  I contacted the Pine
support people about it, and they said the problem would be fixed in
3.94, due out RSN...

Subject: Pine mail quotas
Date: 17 May 1996 00:35:10 GMT
Message-Id: <4nghjv$c7a@news.bu.edu>

Please help; I am a non-techie running pine 3.91 on the server of a small
South American university.  By default, I am the resource person on
internet matters.  Our problem is that we are running out of disk space!
  We have users who subscribe to lists and then never look at their inboxes
which fill with hundreds of messages.  My question is this:

Is there a way to configure pine to put a QUOTA, either in bytes or number
of messages, on the inboxes of all users?  Presently the systems
administrators
are indiscriminatingly erasing all the messages in our inboxes when the disk
fills up.
Obviously, not an adequate solution.  Every other system I have had an account
on have had a mail quota, but I can't figure out
how to set one up.  Can anybody help?

ProComm Plus eats ^_ and something else, ^] I think. I thought THAT was
bad. If a comms program uses ANY Control code it should at least let
the user choose between sending the code (perhaps by hitting the same
key again) and doing whatever local function the programmer thought
couldn't be put on Alt (yeah, I know, W!&#@%S wants Alt for its own
exclusive use, but that's another matter). Oops, back to editors....

Actually there was another thing that I was a bit curious about.  I went 
and set my term program for slow speed, 1200 or 2400, and then I dialed 
in.  I set Pine for assume-slow-link.  And then went to the Pine Index 
screen.  There was no hightlighting, but it did not seem all that fast 
either.  Since all Pine has to do to move from one line to the next is 
erase the arrow on the current line, and put it on the next line, I 
expected that even with a 1200 modem, cursoring up and down through the 
Index would be almost instantaneous.  

But it was not.  It takes an appreciable amount of time.  Not that this 
really matters - it doesn't matter at all for my current modem.  But I am 
just curious.  Surely Pine does not have to send more than 10 bytes over 
the modem lines, and they should go by as quick as a wink.  Right?

1) That syntax (called "source routing") was deprecated in the
   Internet protocol suite several years ago, in favor of just
   some@address, or in a pinch some%address@some.host (the
   so-called "%-hack").
2) If you really want to use source routing, put angle brackets
   around it, e.g. <@some.host:some@address>

You don't.  What you're essentially saying is, "my mailer has a kludge to
do something useful when the user runs a broken program that doesn't
generate From:  headers, how can I break Pine to take advantage of this
kludge?" 

The right thing to do is to make your mailer play ball with programs that
are not broken.  Then, instead of having a kludge, you have a generally
useful facility.

There is a patch to sendmail.cf floating around that will do this; it
makes sendmail work with both broken and non-broken programs.

You need to list newsgroups in the Newsgroups: header (abbreviated
Newsgrps: in the composer), not the To: header!  Press ^R in the
headers if you don't see the Newsgrps: line.

Pine handles MIME digest well IMHO and doesn't require metamail
for it. Alas! it is still not possible to reply to individual article in
digest. Probably, if there were more of them, we could justify the efforts  
to spend some time on it ;-) (I put up the question in version 3.91 -
still no response in 3.93)

It is definitely *not* X-client. Last version 3.93 includes support for
mouse in xterm and ability to switch icon name if new mail arrives.

I have just spent half a day chasing this same problem. Mimetypes worked fine 
if I typed the filename directly into the header field (in lower case, of 
course), but wouldn't work if I used the Windows selection dialog. Thanks for 
the tip, Dave - another problem solved.

But, to the Pine team, is there any reason why we couldn't have mimetypes 
case-insensitive in the next revision?

Thanks,

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

1.  When someone sends email with long lines, pine puts in soft
returns as needed for the screen display -- no problem.
But when I print the same message, the lines are chopped off and
the ends are lost.  How can we fix this?

2.  Another question, is there an option in pine to
use extended character sets under UNIX?  A colleague in Peru used to
send me things in Spanish and all the characters with accents were
garbled.


Thanks for your help!

Hello Roland.

Providing you are using Pine 3.92 or up, your problem is most likely
related to an incomplete termcap entry (yes Steve, you're right :-) 

I've just checked my own Linux /etc/termcap and found it to contain two
xterm entries, with an incomplete one coming first (and thus winning). 

Search for the first |xterm| entry and make sure the following fields are
included:

  :kP=\E[5~:kN=\E[6~:

Should your system be configured to use terminfo instead of termcap, make
sure the following fields are included to the source for xterm:

  kpp=\E[5~, knp=\E[6~,

If they're not, add them and recompile the entry by running "tic <file>".

Should you require any assistance, don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,

- Richard Gering.

Could somebody, please, tell me which tools (compilers etc) are
used to build the Pine for PC? I am good at Unix but I know very
little about PCs.

Could you please send me hints as the makefile.win does not help me.

Thank you in advance,

Many thanks for the information.  I'll pick up the 3.2.5 binary and give
it a whirl.

I reported the same problem. If you are running pine in an xterm you can
force the screen to appear correctly if you change the window size after
having pressed "C". BTW the same happens if you try to edit entries in
your address book. I have got an answer to my problem from Alessandro
Miotto (CERN), which says that if you compile pine3.93 under AIX3.2.5 this
version also runs under AIX4.1:

Hi.
It seems there is a bug in pine 3.93 that causes the low percentage of 
mail to be lost. When sending a message it sometimes doesn't get sent but 
placed in the file dead.letter. It gets placed there particially 
sometimes (only headers). And no trace in sent-mail. It happened not often 
but a few times a day in the system with 70 users. So I changed back to 
pine 3.91 which works fine.

Hello,

I have just installed pine 3.93 on a windows95 PC and on an SGI. I find
that it is very slow in making connections to the server on the PC  and in
sending on the PC and the SGI (sending takes much longer compared to
version 3.91). Does anyone know if something significant has changed with
this effect?

Thanks,

 Joop Jansen

Hi all, I'm running Pine 3.91 under FreeBSD and I've run into an interesting
problem. I was going through my folders cleaning them out and I decided to
delete a postponed message I had.  Only thing is, I didn't think to get rid of
it by aborting it, I just deleted it out of the folder. I figured that pine
would be smart enough to check the postponed folder for the actual prescence
of a message.  Apparently this was a pretty bad assumption on my part. Pine
still thinks I have a message to continue, but if I try to continue, it just
dies and drops back to a shell. Any ideas how I can get the continue to go
away(I've got one, but I'm looking for others just in case). More importantly
does anyone else think it's a good idea to check the folder for the existance
of a letter?
Thanks!

Hi,

Do you have a simple setup to convert entries from a .mailrc format to
.adddressbook format?

I am reading my e-mail, using hyperterminal, Windows 95. The screen I am
typing on is black & the letters are typing white.  I would like to have
the screen white & the letters black. Could you advise me what
adjustments I need to make? This is hard to stare at for a long time, & I
receive a lot of e-mail. When I press "edit" & then "select all", the
background on my screen turns bright blue, but I still have the white
lettering. Thank you for your assistance.

    I use ProComm Plus v2/DOS, and it _does_ let you choose, so to
speak.  It has a keyboard remapping facility (check the manual) which
allows you to remap the function keys, the numeric keypad, and so on. 
I remapped them to send out ^_, ^[, ^], and others as needed.  Quite
likely other professional-quality communications packages have
remapping capability as well.

Immediate solution: delete the empty postponed messages folder file.

Better solution: upgrade to Pine 3.93

It is certainly on our list of things to do, but not there yet.

There's a way to do this (I think).  You will need to setup a global fixed
configuration (normally located as /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed).  It
should look as follows: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
feature-list=auto-move-read-msgs,
	expunge-without-confirm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individual users will not be able to override these settings from within
their own setups.  Basically, this will move any read messages to a local
folder within their home directory (by default ~/mail/READBOX), and
delete them from their inbox when the quit Pine.

Many thanks to all who sent the patch update to me; I forwarded 
a copy of it to my sysadmin and assume he has re-compiled the
program, as the problem is gone.

Once again, thanks to all of you.

Message-Id: <4nhphm$2q4@spinnaker.rhein.de>

Here is the new and improved version of my pine-input-filter
pgpdecode.

This new version supports 
- PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCKs
- multiple PGP BLOCKs in one message
- unsigned and unencrypted text outside the PGP BLOCKs

It does not yet support nested PGP BLOCKS (does someone need this?).

Here it is:

Dear PINE Gurus:

I am running Solaris 2.3 and I am trying to use the build command to make a new version of PINE on my machine.. I type "build gso" for building the solaris version using gcc as we the pine-ports document.. but I get the following errors on the first "leg" of the compiling process (making c-client library, mtest and imapd)....

In file included from os_sol.c:73:
tz_sv4.c:47: `tzname' undeclared (first use this function)
tz_sv4.c:47: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
tz_sv4.c:47: for each function it appears in.)
tz_sv4.c:47: `daylight' undeclared (first use this function)
*** Error code 1

This is a snipet from what is attached below (the full compile log)...

pico and pilot seem to compile without a hitch and then when it tries to make pine itself, it seems to die again.  I suspect it can't build pine since it needs the c-client and it didn't build the c-client correctly...

Any help is appreciated, in fact, precomipled Solaris 2.3 executables would be great! ;)

I know this message is a little vauge, but I haven't had much experience building pine before.. just thought it would be plug-and-play... but I guess not (at least for me).

Tom.

Is your Pine built with the SENDNEWS definition in pine/osdep/os-lnx.h
uncommented?  The default is to have local inews posting disabled...

Catalogue Format Options:
1.  19-Part email- can be read by EVERYONE (~525 K Total).
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached text file ~525K - you
     must know how to download an attached text file and then be able to
     open it with your word processor.  If in doubt, don't ask for this
     version.  This isn't for internet *newbies.* Better to order option 1
     and spend a few minutes pasting them into one whole text document
     with your word processor, than to waste hours trying to figure how
     to deal with this option.
3.  For more advanced Macintosh computer users: compressed attached
     text file, created with a Stuffit(tm) self-extracting archive (.sea),
      ~133K.  Can be decompressed by any Macintosh computer user; no
     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed.  You
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as 
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut 
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in 
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be 
     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with
     Stuffit(tm),  ~114K.  Can be decompressed by any computer user who
     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your
     download time by 78%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in option
     #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be able to do.



Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Morris Wade and I recently started using a magazine subscription
club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription deal with your
first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.    They have over
1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to any country on a
subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the USA, they more of a
selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have magazines for most every
area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of
what the newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people buy
magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes or
hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like to make
it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper than all
their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the publishers
themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half their business
comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new members who only speak
limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy* student.  I
don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone run my
part-time software business!  Please fill out the above form and carefully
follow the intructions above to get it to them via fax or smail.

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are less
than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other times,
just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet.  They
assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.  

They have been very helpful and helped me with all my address changes as I
haved moved from one country to another.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from a
special list of over 270 popular titles published in the USA.   They will
give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order with them
to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500 different popular
USA titles they sell.  

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 45 or 46 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a charge
for FPH (foreign postage and handling) (on both paid and freebie subs) that
varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be very
friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change when I
moved from one country to another.
 
The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first purchase
automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who he accepts
as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he himself calls you
personally on the phone to explain how he works his deal, or sometimes he has
one of his assistants call.  He is kind of quirky sometimes - he insists on
setting up new members by phone so he can say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't
want to have his phone bills!),  but you can place future orders (after your
first order) via E-mail.   

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas, he
will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he still
makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long distance
rates are cheaper then.  

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had a
2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they could
join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately when you
call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new members  the
same day or within a few days now, as they have increased their staff.  I am
not sure about this.........but if you email the above form to them, that is
the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and juicey)
!)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of all the
freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by categories
and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what he
sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Morris Wade

I just returned from a two week leave and found the message from Pine
advising of the updating of the Pine program. Previous to this updating,
I was able to print with the Y command. I no longer can do this and would
appreciate any help you can give me so that I can use this command. Thank
you.  phandler@kaiwan.com

Subject: Pine and Free Software
Message-Id: <DrLwvp.Cw0@spdcc.com>
Date: Sat, 18 May 1996 15:11:49 GMT

Last month the GNU project began recruiting people to continue
maintainance of the free version of Pine.  We did this because the
latest Pine release is not free software.  It can't be used in the GNU
system (or any free operating system).

It's true that you can get a copy of the newer Pine gratis--"free" in
one sense of the word--over the Internet.  But this is not what "free
software" means.  Free software refers to freedom, not price.  More
precisely, it refers to certain specific, related freedoms.

What are these freedoms?

First, the freedom to copy a program, and distribute it to others;
second, the freedom to change a program as you wish, by having full
access to source code; third, the freedom to distribute a modified
version and thus contribute to the community.  Free software means you
can port it or improve it, and then share your work with others, who
can then make further improvements.  You can do these things either
gratis or for a fee.

(We could add a zeroth item to the list--the freedom to run the
program.  But in most cases that goes without saying.)

You may or may not pay a price to get a copy of a free program.  In
practice, many people get copies of free programs over the Internet
and don't have to pay, while many others pay to get copies of the same
programs on CD-ROM.  But no matter how you get your copy, these free
programs give you all the freedoms described above; that's what makes
them free programs.

The old distribution terms for Pine used to give everyone these
freedoms.  The new distribution terms do not.  For example, they don't
give permission for distributing modified versions.  You can write
"local modifications", but you can't release them to the community
for others to build on.

The new Pine terms permit redistribution by individuals, but not by
companies.  In this respect, too, the new Pine falls short of being
free software.

Either of these problems, by itself, makes it impossible to include
Pine in an operating system that is supposed to consist entirely of
free software.

This change in Pine distribution terms gave the GNU project just three
alternatives: stop using Pine, stay with Pine 3.91 forever, or start
independent development.  I chose the last alternative so that we can
continue offering users a supported version of Pine.

I made this choice with regret--after first trying my utmost to
convince the Pine developers at the University of Washington to
continue developing Pine as free software.  I wish we could continue
using their versions and avoid a fork in Pine development; I wish they
would change their minds for whatever reasons.

Whatever the people at the University of Washington do, we should do
whatever is best, under the circumstances, for the free software
community.

In the present circumstances, what is best is to maintain a separate
free version of Pine.

There is a prebuilt Solaris executable on ftp.cac.washington.edu in
unix-bin.

You must have a broken version of GCC.  You can try to change "tz_sv4.c"
to "tz_nul.c" in pine3.93/imap/non-ANSI/c-client/os_sol.c

Subject: Using an address from a list
Date: 18 May 1996 18:25:25 -0400
Message-Id: <4nliol$omv@alpha.delta.edu>

I'm using Pine 3.93 on a OSF/1 system. I have about 50 addresses in a
distribution list. I recall in an earlier version of Pine I could go to
the expanded view of the list, highlight an individual address and pull
just that address. I tried that in 3.93 today. Even though I was
highlighting an address within the list the whole list was pulled. 

Is it possible in Pine 3.93 to select only one address from the entire
list? By the way, I tried ListMode but that is for single address entries
in the AddressBook or for an entire list.

Thank you.

Johanna

I tried that by hand myself (Pine 3.91, Linux), and it worked - sort of.
I got an error message about write failed.

Subject: PINE v3.93 Compilation Problems
Date: 17 May 1996 16:40:49 GMT
Message-Id: <4nia6h$fo6@news1.i1.net>

Hello folks.

I am currently a tech at a small local ISP and am looking to get the new
version of PINE installed.  I am not a C-wizard but I have compiled programs
before.

PINE seems to compile PICO and PILOT but nothing else.  Does anybody have
WORKING BSD/OS v2.0.1 binaries for the complete PINE package?  3.93 does not
compile out of the box for me as purported.

Thanks,
Timothy

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your suggestion.  Now I can use Thai character to compose
message.  Could you please point me to see information about each type of
character set ?  for example, X-ISO-8859-1 , X-ISO-8859-2 ,...  What these
character set for?

Thank you again for you suggestion,
Suwat Panitkullawat..

Hi!

I just got your package 'pine3.93.tar.gz'. I want to build it for
Linux. I use the S.u.S.E. distribution Dec 95 with Kernel 1.2.13 
and gcc version 2.7.0.

I unpacked the tar-file and hopefully entered 'build lnx'.
Obviously the compiler started its work and even brought up
'pico' and 'pilot'.

The problem is that there are several errors and the binary for
'pine' isn't built. 

Perhaps I have to take care for something *before* I start 'build'.
I hope you can help me to solve this problem.

Here is what the compiler says:

Hi,


i installed the userdb Database to enable Adresses like

but this doesn't work with pine - works fine with the UNIX Mailer:-(
What's the reason for this?

TIA for Help

    I don't think it's a question of "better," only "different."  Basic
JOE seems to have various capabilities.  Whether and how those
capabilities are available for use depends largely on the configuration
file for the particular "flavor" with which the editor is invoked,
i.e., the name of the executable.  Not all pre-made configuration files
seem to make use of all the capbilities of the editor.

    For example, when I was using either Pico or jpico, I would often
have reason to duplicate a line in place.  A quick and dirty way of
doing this is to put the cursor on the line and use the key sequence
^K^U^U .  However, when I switched to "vanilla" JOE, this technique
did not work.

    It seems that under the covers, JOE (generically) has commands such
as dellin, picokill, yank, and yankpop.  In the supplied .jpicorc,
picokill and yank are bound to control-key combinations and work pretty
much as in Pico.  But in the supplied .joerc file, picokill and yank
are _not_ bound, whereas dellin and yankpop are.  Therefore, the
familiar key sequences will work with jpico but not with standard JOE.

    However, one of the overwhelming advantages of a configurable
editor like JOE is that it allows you to choose things to suit your
taste, just as long as you do not trip over your own feet (such as
duplicate keybindings).  To get the "Pico" effect, all I had to do was
go into the .joerc config file, insert entries for picokill and yank,
and bind them to control-key sequences that were available and made
sense to me.

    Which form of the editor should you use?  Well, obviously that's up
to you.  If your fingers really are in a Pico mode, then I would
suggest jpico, which "looks and feels" a lot like Pico and gives you
added capabilities.  If you want to, you can always jigger around with
the .jpicorc file to suit your tase.  However, be aware that jpico is
not a perfect duplication of the control-key sequences.  In a few
instances, you have to get used to entering ^[ first.  But jpico is a
fairly close match.

I would like to filter my incoming mail by subject, so the mail is 
received in unique folders.  Example:

INBOX
JOE
MARTHA

So, if a subject line were JOE or MARTHA, the mail would automatically go 
to those folders instead of INBOX.

Can anybody e-mail me some help on this?

This problem depends upon what version of Linux you have, and is fixed
once and for all in Pine 3.94 (which should be released Real Soon Now).
The fix is fairly complex, so there isn't a patch.  Until 3.94 is out, you
can get prebuilt Linux binaries from our FTP server.  Our Linux systems
never have these problems...

If you're curious about what's wrong, read on.

The basic problem is that some organization which declared itself to be a
"Unix standards committee" decreed that the iov_base member of the iovec
struct used by writev() should be a void* instead of a caddr_t.  This
imbecilic change was made in spite of the fact that writev() was invented
on BSD, where it has been a caddr_t for many years.

Ordinarily, this would just be a minor footnote in the sordid history of
"Not Leaving Well Enough Alone on Unix", except for the fact that a
caddr_t can be indexed and a void* can't be.  It's not even a compiler
warning; it's a fatal error.  OK, so we put in the correct definition
since in other respects a void* and a caddr_t are equivalent.

But now let Linux rear its chameleon face.  Not only did Linux foolishly
adopt that change (some versions of Linux have the right one), but on the
systems which have it wrong, the wrong definition keeps on moving!  It's
been in sys/types.h, uio.h, socket.h(!), linux/uio.h -- seemingly every
time I nail down where it is, it moves someplace else.

If I were paranoid, I'd think that Richard Stallman was instigating it as
a plot to kill Pine. ;-)  [No wonder nothing ever came out of GNU OS
project...]

Anyway, writev() is gone in 3.94.  Most of the reasons for using it in the
past have become irrelevant.  It's been a long and frustrating process,
but as of 3.94 this problems should be gone forever.

Subject: Using Pine 2.93 on Windows 95

I just downloaded Pine for Windows 95 and I can't get it to work.

I cannot compose messages with it.  Whenever I try to compose a message I
get this error message: "Can't send message without an open remote folder"

I do not understand why it is telling me this.  I have tried every
different configuration that I can think of.

By the way I am running my own SMTP and NNTP daemons on this machine. 
Pine should not have any problems opening whatever files it needs since
there are no "permissions" in the Windows 95 file system.

I *can* get it to read news from my server but it doesn't recognize any
groups that have more than three parts to the newsgroup name (eg.
foo.bar.bar) but anything longer than this it will not recognize (eg.
alt.foo.bar.bar).

Could somebody *please* tell me what to put in my pinerc file so I can
use pine.  I really like the interface.

Thanks in advance.

Jeff

From: "Doug Wong, CCST - HKUST, Tel: (852) 2358 6256, Fax: (852) 2358 0967" <ccdoug@uxmail.ust.hk>


Hi, I have encountered some problems of Pine 3.93 on PC.  I have
installed the 16 bit Pine 3.93 on Windows 3.1.  I find everything
works fine except 2.

Firstly, the Zoom command in the Message menu is always dimmed.  But
the function works OK if I type "Z" key instead.  Is it a bug?

Secondly, the sorting is unacceptablely slow.  It takes "minutes"(at
the first time I thought my session was hung) to do a simple sorting
in a folder contains 100 mails.  I tried the 32 bit Pine and it did
the same sorting action within a second.  Unfortunately I cannot find
a 32 bit spell checker for it, and I experienced some problem with 32
bit Pine when it used alternate editor like MS Word.  So I probably
will consider putting the 16 bit on our University's environment
instead.  But the slow sorting problem is needed to be solved.

Could somebody tell me if I can do anything to make the 16 bit Pine
sorts faster?  I might need to ask the students not to use the sorting
function if the problem is not solvable.

Thank you in advance.

Doug

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, I've been out of town.  

I did get a response, it apparantely is a problem with the sendmail that
ships with HP-UX.  It was recommended that I try the pine 3.91 sendmail
string (which didn't help), then try upgrading sendmail.  I've tried
upgrading sendmail on two different HP-UX 9 systems (both 300 series) and
had slightly different results - both however had unacceptable problems
so for now I'll have to either live with the problem or go back to 3.91.

Someone on the HP Admin's mailing list is also having a problem, when they
summarize their findings I'll let ya know if it's any different.

Vince.

Hello!

	I have PCPine 3.93, running Win95, 8 mb ram.

	I am a co-listowner of a 600+ member mailing list, and
frequently get upwards of 100 error messages during each session I
am on line.  I delete these first, quit Pine, and go back in right
away.  This works fine.

	Sometimes I quit Pine again and go back in again.  But if
I try this a third time, Pine won't let me out, it loops back to
the login and I have to go through the whole login process and
then close the Pine window, instead of being able to use the Quit
command.

	A friend says this is because I have only 8 mg of ram.  Is
this right?

	Also, I cannot open PCPine off line to read what's in my
folders. What is the reason for this?  Every time I try I get a 
blank screen and have to reboot the computer.  

	I rarely read this newsgroup, so please address replies
here and also to my email address of saraa@halcyon.com. Thank you
very much!

Subject: pico won't write the buffer!

Actually, I have two things. First, when I got the pine3.93.tar.gz, my gzip
wouldn't decompress it. I kept getting crc errors. I also couldn't
decompress the .Z file. I finally found a copy of pine3.91 in the
netherlands, which worked fine. It decompressed, untarred, and compiled.

The other problem I'm having is with pico. I've used both a pre-compiled
binary, and the one created when I built the pine/pico package. PIne runs
fine. Pico runs fine, with one exception. It won't write the buffer to
disk. Nothing I've tried works.

I'm running MachTen on a 630 series Mac, 12MB ram, 230MB HD (64MB free space).

Pico has rwx permissions for owner (root) and rx permissions for group and
other. I'm running it as root, so I should be able to write a file
anywhere. It wouldn't even write to the root home directory, so I think I
can rule out a permission problem.

Any help you could give me with this problem would be greatly appreciated.

I get the following error message from pine:

        IMAP connection broken(server response)

Pine doesn't prompt me for my password, therefore I cannot acces my 
inbox.      
Anyone know how I deal with this.

thanx,

Shirley,
I noticed your message on the world-wide Pine newsgroup...
Don't know if the problem is solved, but if not, I'd suggest
sending a note to "help@cac.washington.edu"

How do I remove the old messages from the index screen of Pine ?

I tried the "x" command, but that doesn't work.

Let's see if I can ask the question differently.

In "nn", I type capital "X" and that tells the machine that 
I have finnished with all those messages and don't want to 
see them again.

What is the equivalent command in Pine ???

Thank you
Clint

>Is there any reasonable way to extract all mail messages
>to ascii text without selecting individual messages?

You did not identify your hardware/software combination,
so I can give only general instructions.

Two methods are discussed in the Pine 3.93 documentation file:
export and print.

First, modify your configuration.  At the main menu,
select SETUP, then Configuration.  Turn on two features
in the configuration list:

[X] enable-aggregate-command-set
[X] print-formfeed-between-messages

Return to the mail folder (typically INBOX or saved-messages)
or newgroup folder.

At the index screen, press the following keys in order:

; a a e

(select, all, apply, export)

Enter name of ascii file to which to write messages.



!!! QUESTION FOR PINE DEVELOPMENT TEAM !!!
When =exporting=, is there a way to put unique character
between messages (i.e., record delimiter), like the
formfeed character?




The Print method WILL insert a formfeed between each message.

; a a y

(select, all, apply, prynt)

You may see other menus if you have enable two other features
in the Setup/Configuration screens:  printing index screen
in addition to messages, and custom print commands.


If your environment consists of a desktop PC, running terminal
emulation software (VT100), which connects by modem and phoneline
to a Unix Internet Gateway running Pine, this is quite slow, but
effective.

Your Ascii printer can either be a true printer, or it can
be a disk file.  If you use true-blue MS-Kermit, or C-Kermit
from Columbia University <ftp://watsun.cc.columbia.edu/pub/kermit>,
set your "printer" to a file by typing at the prompt:

MS-Kermit>set printer c:\myfile.txt

Procomm and other popular telecommunications software also allows
one to set up a "printer" which is a disk file.

I was perfectly happy with the previous version... 

There may be some benefits in newest that just appeared on
my screen that I have yet to work out. What is most evident
immediately/at the moment, however, is what, for me, is an 
obvious and annoying *disadvantage.*

---------------------------------------------------------------
The contents of various folder(s) of sent mail are now/suddenly 
all listed by _my name_, rather than by name of _person to whom_
sent. Thus, to find almost any such message for whatever reasons
I now have to open and search through several: the index alone 
will no longer tell me what I need to know: the effort is extra,
and annoying!

Was there supposed to be some advantage to this new mode that
I don't (yet) appreciate?

Is there any way to get the old format of listing by addressee back?
(and, if so, can someone explain it in very simple clear terms...)

still the same old version of

Hi, my girlfriends computer refuses to let her use the arrow keys in 
Pine, and for that matter, Lynx also.
We are on the same server, the .cshrc and .login files are identical to 
mine, but no such luck...
When using her computer offline, it also works just the same as mine, a

Anyone have the slightest idea what may be wrong??
Please, no email replies, some one else may want to know also! :)

Hello...

I like seeing the ">" character to the left of messages that I respond 
to, it is a good way to keep track of who-said-what...  However, there 
is one case where it would be nice if I could delete all the ">" 
characters without editing each line and at the same time respond to the

bit of text will be almost the same in each mesages and that message is 
being constantly passed back and forth between two people...  Like a  
e-mail chess game

When ^C doesn't want to work, try hitting ESC-ESC-C (ESC key twice followed

How would one go about setting up a system to read/post local newsgroups? 
My intention is not at the moment to link up with Internet groups, just 
to use the system as a bit of a bulletin board. 

My systems is SCO Openserver 5.0.0.

Just curious....

Subject: Building Pine3.93 on SCO OSR5 with GCC
Date: 20 May 1996 14:30:58 GMT
Message-Id: <4npvn2$1qm@aztec.co.za>

I am trying to compile Pine 3.93 on SCO Openserver 5.0.0 using gcc. I 
have a working binary of Pine 3.91 , but due to some minor problems 
(garbage coming down the line on several terminals), I thought the 
solution might be to build my own binary. So I chose Pine3.93, which I 
downloaded. I build with

  build CC=gcc sco

The output follows. If anyone could help I would appreciate it. My email
address is aempire@aztec.co.za or neil@aerial.pix.za. Thanks.

Hi!

Little problem with pgpdecode and Pine 3.93.

I tried to setup the pgpdecode (I used mkpgp before) and it works really
fine. Only one comment.

If I reply to a PGP message and decide to include original message, text
is passed through display filter (in this case pgpdecode) and thus the
included text contains output of filter together with original message. I
find it at least strange.

Is it a problem of filter or Pine? The culprit seems to be the Pine - why
display filter is called when R)eplying to message at all?

thanks in advance

Elaine,
Pine needs to know your email address in order to distinguish mail from
you and mail to you. Something has presumably changed with your default
address (or Pine's knowledge of it).
In the new version of Pine there is a feature that allows you to specify
one or more versions of your address so that it will be better at
deciding something is from you. The feature is
alt-addresses
in the Config Screen (Go to Mail Manu (M), then Setup (S) then Config
(C), and scan for alt-addresses.

No, that was unintentionally broken.  It will be fixed in 3.94, which will
be released in a few days if all goes well.

Hi,

We just compiled pine 3.9.3 to out Linux-system, and there seems to be 
some kind of problems with lock-files.
When user runs pine, it says :

	Error creating /var/spool/mail/username.lock...

This only exist, if user has something in his mailbox.
Older version of pine (3.9.1) still works fine without complaints...

I would appreciate any help

That's not the problem.  The problem is that pine is very naive about
screen refreshes.  If you have a slow connection, it can take quite a
while to do simple things like paging the file.

You use the pine.conf.fixed features to disable alternate editor.
We have a similar system, and have set all the editor features to "no",
and also set a value for "editor".

Since the spec used to be precisely that FCC="" meant no FCC, this is a
BUG. 
(I know because we fell into this by accident when we first introduced
Pine to the mass audience, and we could not understand for a while why
people were losing their FCCs).

Set directory protection on /var/spool/mail to 1777, the way it's supposed
to be.  You probably have it set to 775 in a mistaken notion that this
"enhances security".

It did not "work fine without complaints" in 3.91.  It didn't complain; it
just didn't lock the mailbox, leaving it vulnerable to being trashed if
mail was delivered while Pine was updating the mailbox.

Yup, it's a lot easier.  The folders (except for "INBOX") are stored in a
directory called "mail".  They're just text files that contain all the
messages in that folder.  Pine (and most other mail programs) separate the
messages by looking for a blank line followed by the word "From " with a
trailing space.

So, you should just be able to change to your "mail" directory and use the
standard download commands to get the files.  On my system, this would
work:

    cd mail

You mention "the downloading feature on my service provider's menu", which
implies some sort of non-standard front-end to everything.  If you can't
figure it out in a couple tries, the best thing to do is to talk to your
service provider and ask them how to do the download.  (In fact, that's
not bad advice in general!  Your system administrator is probably a
friendly sort who'd be more than happy to help!)

The "INBOX" folder is a different beast.  It's usually in a separate
directory and named by your userid, something like
"/usr/spool/mail/murrelld".  This is more system dependent.  I don't
really recommend trying to download this unless you're comfortable moving
around a Unix system.  For your purposes it'll probably be easier to use
Pine to save (or copy) specific messages to your own folders and download
them with the instructions I showed above. 

What I described is a pretty standard setup.  Your system may be set up
differently.  If you have problems, please talk to your service provider.
Their the only ones who can tell you exactly how their system is set up.

Now, *why* you'd want your mail as MS-Word documents is your own
problem...

Ack!  Why can't people make working terminal emulators?

There are two things you can do: ESC X brings up an emacs like command
prompt.  You can type the command 'format' from there.  Also you can make a
customized keyboard layout: copy the system's jpicorc file (usually found in
/usr/local/lib/jpicorc or /usr/lib/jpicorc) into HOME/.jpicorc

Edit this file: you'll see how to change the key bindings.  Note that if you
use ESC ESC J for justify, you wont be able to bring up jpico's options menu
(which is ESC ESC), so you may want to swap a few things around.

Subject: pine --> eudora MIME problem
Date: 22 May 1996 04:43:23 GMT
Message-Id: <4nu61b$10t@ibridge.iohk.com>


Why is there a difference between the way Pine treats a mimed attachment 
that originates in pine and one that originates in eudora - and how can I 
change it ?

I use Pine to mail a simple ASCII file to a colleague in Canada.

If I send the email to myself with the file attached it arrives OK and I
can read it in pine (using the Viewer command to see the attachment). 

When she reads it with Eudora the attachment is incorporated in the body 
of the message , with various headers attached.  this causes hassle 
because she has to manually edit the message to separate the attachment.

We have the same problem the other way around too. If she sends me a 
message with a mimed attachment I get lines inserted in the message 
telling me to use 'munpack' to decode it. 


My question again - 
Why is there a difference between the way Pine treats a mimed attachment 
that originates in pine and one that originates in eudora - and how can I 
change it ?

Thanks in advance for any help.

D will mark a message as ready for deletion and then X will eXpunge all
messages tagged as deleted. 

Also when you leave Pine you'll be prompted to expunge deleted messages ? 
unless you turn the prompt off in the setup/config screens

I would like to report some problems I have encountered with Pine 3.93
on AIX 4.1.4.

1. When composing a message and pressing PgUp or PgDwn (while in the
   message area) the screen frozes.
   
2. When i select C (Compose) in the Main screen , While pine reads the
    messages from INBOX , the Compose screen overlays the main screen
    
It seems that those problems occure the most when  working on a PC with
HCL/eXceed emulation .

Greetings,

I have a couple of Virtual Domains that I host on my Mail server.  The problem is when any of those domains send out mail, sendmail tacks on the actual ssystem name as the reply to address and not the virtual domain name.
We even tried changing it in the POP client configuration (Eudora, to be exact).
I'm using Sendmail 8.7.3 on SunSparc 5.

Any help will be great !!
you can send me mail at hostmaster@skyweb.net

I am still using Pine 3.91. It was okay until recently but now I cannot
cancel messages using ^c so I'm forced to postpone them instead. Moreover
the arrow keys don't work at all. My service provider has been unable to
offer any advice. I should add that in the past month I've been able to
use the arrow keys on only one occasion. The only thing I can think of was
that I put my Compaq Presario into a "reputable shop" to have the RAM
upgraded to 8Mb, have a 14.400bps internal modem installed( I was and am
still using a 2400 bps modem), and have a clock doubler installed. They
were only able to do the first task as they didn't have any experience
with Compaqs before (this is Thiland!). Since the machine came back I keep
getting an error message whenever I try to open Word6. I click on"okay"and
the error message disappears and then reappears .This happens once again
then everything works as normal. Could the dolts who fiddled around with
my computer have done something that is causing these problems? Oh one
more thing:I can no longer use the arrow keys when I'm accessing the web
using Lynx. It's very frustrating. Can anyone please offer any advice to
this computer novice.  
Regards,

Ilyas

Is it possible to change the displayed width of the screen? I have a
terminal that won't handle more than 25 character wide display, and I'd
like to change the setting so I can use it for Pine. <btw> Using Pine
through a terminal in win95 works great, but I have a small dumb terminal
that I can use for e-mail that I'd like to use.
Thanks,

I am trying to compile pine 3.93 on AIX 4.1, but it seems to want X
installed for some reason. Is there a way that I can compile without an X
interface?

if there is a way please contact me at sbaillar@rgti.com

thanks in advanced,

How can I limit the size of a newsgroup I want to access to, say, to the 
latest 100 or 200 postings?  

Some newsgroups I want to see are upwards of 20K postings and either Pine
itself or my internet provider's UNIX system (HOSTTYPE=bsd386,
MACHTYPE=i386) will not display them for me.  The system times out, or, if
I try to sort the posings by date, the system runs out of memory and ends
the Pine program. 

What I'm hoping for is some kind of argument I can hand to Pine (or one 
of its routines) that will limit its access to the latest few postings 
in a particular newsgroup and ignore the rest.  Possible?????

Thanx in advance --

    This is commonly done, although unfortunately you did not supply
quite enough information, namely, what operating system are you using
Pine under?

    Pine by itself will not filter mail into different incoming folders
the way you want.  However, if you are using Pine on some sort of Un*x
system, both filter and procmail will do what you want.

    If you have a world Wide Web browser, browse my home page and
follow the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  A couple of links in, she
has an abundance of information on mail filtering.

Subject: Using Pine & Pico on Wyse 60 terminals
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I just got a copy of Pine 3.91 and it seems like a very good e-mail 
package.

I need some help making Pine and Pico work with Wyse 60 terminals.
I am trying to get the arrow and function keys to work.

I was able to modify Pine to work ok (a few changes to ttyin.c), but I 
am having trouble modifying Pico.

Does anyone know of a port that handles Wyse 60's?

Or can someone direct me to the routines that I would need to monidy in 
Pico to add the Wyse 60 arrow and function keys?

Any help or hints would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Eberto

I believe making a list-alias with all their name will work.

: Enable 8-bit ESMTP.

  Even with this option on, it would encode 8bit characters in QP
if 8bit esmtp negotiation with MTA  failed. Sendmail 
8.6.X(where X is 12 if not any number) is 8bit clean, 
but it doesn't follow ESMTP negotiation sequence as described 
in RFC 17?? making pine regard it as not 8bit clean. I
think it might not be a bad idea to add an option
for 'enforce 8bit' as done in Netscape-mail and Eudora.

  I also like to suggest that Base64 rather than QP
is used when an outgoing message consists mostly of
8bit characters as in Korean(euc-kr), Japanese(euc-jp),
,Chinese and other Asian lang. Unlike messages in European
character sets(iso-8859-x where x is 1....9) with
small number of 8bit characters embedded in mostly
7bit US-ASCII characters, messages in East Asian 
are made up of a large number of 8bit characters making
QP very ineffective(the length would be almost
3 times as large as before encoding) compared
with Base64(the length would be 1.5 times as large 
as before encoding)

You can use the alternate-editor to do that. Just use a script to take

Which let's me assume that the rights for the device /dev/null are messed
up.  It should be rw-rw-rw- so that everybody can dump trash into it. :-)

Last time I checked, there were no plans to incorporate killfile 
capabilities in Pine.  Given the proliferation of spamming, trolling, and 
general mischief-making on the (Ab)Usenet, have those plans changed?

Cheers,

Hmmm.  Strange.  I just tried it again with 3.93 under Solaris 2.4 on our
good ol' IPXbox, and it worked fine.  Same result for doing it directly
in the composer or putting it already in an address book entry.  And I know
that it worked before I upgraded from 3.91.  But maybe the Linux binaries
have a bug?  Recompile, pine I mean, not Linux of course?  Otherwise I have
worked with Linux since 1992 and it always worked well, even in those early
days.  Oh, one more thing F.Y.I. I checked the correct rights for /dev/null
and you are absolutely correct.

Still wondering...

There's one in ftp:rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/pine-faq

But I got hold of it by sending an email to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu, with
the command "send usenet/news.answers/mail/pine-faq" in the message. 

There's also one at cac.washington.edu, where Pine was developed :

   http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/faq/
   ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/faq
   mailto:pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu

 - this is different from the one at rtfm.mit.edu.


Hope this helps.

Hi
I have run into the following problem with procmail: Nothing happens! My 
.forward file looks like this:

"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/mail/procmail -f- || exit 75 #gislil"

and my .procmailrc like this:

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=$HOME/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log

VERBOSE=on
::
^From.*gislil
til_min

The .procmail directory is as yet empty. The message I get in syslog is
"Service unavailable" so it seems like I'm doing something fundamentally 
wrong. Procmail never seems to start up and all my mail is silently discarded.
My .forward file is world readable and /usr/local/lib/mail/procmail really
does exist.

So if anyone could tell me what might be wrong, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks

Subject: global addressbook readonly
Message-Id: <sstarrDrIr4K.93M@netcom.com>
Date: Thu, 16 May 1996 22:14:43 GMT

I am trying to create a global address book with pine on a new 
system.  I keep getting a message that the address book is read only,
even if I am root.  I tried deleting the addressbook file pointed to by 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf and that didn't help.  

Also, where is the format for this file listed.  I would like to create 
it using a script or vi, rather than thru pine.

Thanks,

Sue

I managed to fix this problem by setting the user-domain in the Setup
Configuration.  I think that whereas Ver 3.91 allowed me to get away with not
having a correctly set user-domain, version 3.93 doesn't! 

Does anyone have any comments on this?

Message-Id: <4o1lti$9dn@jupiter.fcrd.gov.uk>


Please, can anyone help me?

I've just upgraded from Pine 3.91 to Pine 3.93 on my Sun SPARC system (running
SunOS 4.1.3). I have *not* changed any of the default compile options.

When I used to send mail from Pine under 3.91, it would send it and instantly come
straight back with the "Writing Fcc" message. Under 3.93, I get the message
[Sending mail | 0% |] when I send a message, and this stays on the screen for up to
several minutes, during which time I can't do anything else. 

Why is this? And can I do anything to stop this, or to make it do its work in the
background? 

Thanks in advance,

 Tim Porter

Hello !

Please can anyone give me a hint how
I can filter mail in pine...?

I want to sort incoming mail into folders,
so I can archive my mailing list mail seperate
from my personal mail. Therefore I would
need to Filter the Mail by sender and/or subject.

Is it possible that If I start Pine, it sorts all
the new messages in the proper folder ?

I didnDt find any hints on this.

TIA

Eberto,

If your Unix is equipped with an ANSI-fied entry for the Wyse 60 (e.g. 
"wy60ak") you should try to use this first. Such an entry will most likely
require you to execute "tput init" before doing anything terminal related
in order to program the edit keys with ANSI values.

The advantages of using such a terminal entry are that you can avoid
certain Ctrl-key overlapping problems that will occur when you are using a
regular Wyse 60 entry. Should you be wanting/needing to use the regular
entry, the easiest thing for you to do would be to upgrade to Pine 3.93
(ftp.cac.washington.edu).

The versions 3.92 and up have support for termcap/terminfo built in, which
allows it to support a Wyse 60 as well (providing you termcap and/or
terminfo entries are up to standard). You will need to have a development
system available, as a rebuild is necessary to activate an option that is
required for Wyse terminals (and any other terminal that doesn't always
start its key sequences with and ESCape). 

To activate this option, append "-DTERMCAP_WINS" to the files
pico/makefile.<platform> and pine/makefile.<platform> before building
Pine. Next, do a complete build: you're in business! 

You should be aware that certain Ctrl-key base commands in Pine and Pico
will not work on a Wyse 60, since these commands are identical to the
values returned by some of the edit keys (which now have precedence).
Most noticeably Ctrl-^ (Mark) and Ctrl-K (Cut) will now act as Home and
Cursor-Up respectively.

To use Mark and Cut, press ESC ESC ^ and ESC ESC K instead. In Pine,
ESC ESC <key> is always available as an alternate to pressing Ctrl-<key>.

I hope this will help you to get the Wyse 60 support you're looking for!
If you need some help, feel free to contact me.

Regards,

- Richard Gering.

Hello,

when I reply a message from my inbox, the message becomes marked with an 
'A', but if I'm replying a message and I postpone the composition, then the 
behavior is not the same: there is no mark identifying the fact that the 
message has been answered (even I've sent the answer).

Please, post the answers in this group.

Thank you,

    Your question is about procmail, not about Pine, and this is the
Pine newsgroup.  You might get better service if you subscribe to the
Procmail Mailing List and direct your question there.

    This is such a frequent question it needs to be in an FAQ somewhere. 
Pine by itself will not filter mail into separate incoming folders. 
You have to use something which operates before Pine.  You did not say
what operating system you are using, but if it is Un*x, two of the most
popular programs are filter and procmail.

    If you have a World Wide Web browser, browse my home page and
follow the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  She has a lot of good
material on how to do mail filtering.

Hello Myron,

Do you mind posting (actually crossposting!) your questions to

That way someone else may answer them.  If I have time I'll
answer in the groups.

Thanks and good luck,

Subject: filter

Dear Nancy: Thanks for your info about using elm's filter tool with 
pine.  In you recent FAQ page 17 section 4.0 (Filter).  I was able to set 
up this method and it works well.  However, I am not told by pine when I 
have new mail.  I am forced to look through all of my folders one at a 
time to determine If I have new mail.  The only time pine will prompt me 
is if the mail is saved in the INBOX folder.  Do you have any suggestions 
as to how I can remedy this problem.

Also, Is there a way that I can get pine to give me a summary of filter 
activity and errors when I login and prompt me to erase the filter-log 
file.  

I know that's a lot, but, I hope yo don't mind helping me out.

-MJones :-) Thanks

Maybe the file "postponedmessages" still is there, and then you easily can
remove it.

     First, go into setup/config and make sure that "enable agrigate 
command set" is on.  Once that's done, you can delete messages by several 
categories.  To delete all of them at once, press ";" to begin 
selecting.  Next, press "a" to select all of them.  Finally, press "a" 
again to apply a command to the selected messages and "d" to delete them 
all.  You are prompted every step of the way so it shouldn't be that hard.

Subject: What am I missing???
Date: 22 May 1996 13:37:33 GMT
Message-Id: <4nv5at$jn6@news.umbc.edu>

	Hello everyone, I am trying to build a mailcap file for Pine
3.91 on a Unix platform so it will be able to MIME decode and *view*
(when applicable) gzip, dvi/tex/latex, wordperfect, powerpower, and
uuencoded files.  For example, I have tried the following in a
mailcap file:

DVI/*;/usr/X11/bin/xdvi %s; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"; needsterminal
TEX/*; "
application/x-dvi; "
application/x-tex; "
application/x-latex; "

When I email myself a .dvi file, Pine still reports it as a MULTIPART
message.

Is there a way to tell Pine what encoding to use with a file extension?

If anyone has something like this working, would you please forward the
info?  Any constructive suggestions greatly appreciated.

Please reply by email to mbusse@arl.mil

Thanks,
Mike.

     Hello.  I seem to have missed the original posting of these scripts 
for intergrating PGP with Pine.  If they could be reposted, it would be 
appreciated.  Thanks.

You better decide ... is procmail in /usr/local/lib/mail or
/usr/local/bin/mail. Maybe this is what is causing the problem ???

Yup, it's a bug... but one that's hard to fix until we move to the next
generation c-client libraries later this year.

Subject: how to merge two address books?
Date: 23 May 1996 23:52:10 GMT
Message-Id: <4o2tna$4gv@babyblue.cs.yale.edu>

  A friend of mine is graduating this month and is moving
to Berkeley where her husband studies. She wants to 
keep her address book. She has to use her husband's 
account there for e-mail.  Her husband may or may not
use Pine. If the former is the case, she needs to
merge two address books, hers and his. Is there any
way to merge two address books? Does  concatenating
two of them with cat work ? How about address book
index files? 
 
  Well, I'm aware of the way to keep two separate 
address books with two separate .pinerc, but
it's too much headache to her. 

  I would greatly appreciate any help with this
problem.

   Problem is there are still quite many sendmail 8.6.x's around
which don't follow ESMTP negotiation procedure as specified
in RFC 1652(?) although they speak ESMTP. Hence, IMHO,
it wouldn't be so bad an idea to add(not replace) 
an option to 'enforce'(instead of negotiation) 8bit (i.e. turn OFF
MIME encoding).

: Pine does take the ratio of encoded to unencoded characters into
: account for long messages.  We've also recieved the opposite complaint
: that Pine was too aggressive at switching to BASE64, so we try to find
: a reasonable middle ground... 

  I'm sorry I didn't experiment with long message since I didn't expect
the length of message has any effect on which encoding to be used. I'd
like to suggest that the ratio be taken into account regardless of the
length of the message. I don't think messages in ISO-8859-X  would be
affected by this change as most, if not all, messages in ISO-8859-X
would be encoded in QP even if it's taken into account. On the other
hand, messages in EUC-KR, EUC-JP,SJIS,EUC-CN and other Asian languages
would be encoded in more economical base64 however short they may be.
I found that a message of about 350 "wide characters-2byte-"( i.e. 700
octets of 8bit characters) and 50 7bit characters(space) is still
encoded in QP while a message three times as long is encoded in
Base64.

   Thank you for your response and looking forward to hearing 
from you again.

Hello

I'm trying to 
	-  automate MIMEd transfers of ASCII text via email
and	- to filter incoming email according to sender and/or subject.

Due to the setup at my workplace and internet service provider I'm now 
needing to use both Pine and Unix for the first time.

I've followed a couple of posts here that have mentioned things like 
procmail, .procmailrc, filter, .forward , etc etc

Can anyone point me to where I can find out 
	- what these are 
	- whether they're general unix utilities or just for pine
	- Definitions /syntax for procmail configuration file 
	- any other useful information that I may need but dont know to 
	  ask for.

I'm not stupid - just a beginner, so no more "how can you exist if you
dont know THAT ??"  sort of replies.... .Please.

Replies by email or to the newsgroup are fine.
Thanks in advance for any help.

Had difficulty with non-ANSI compile of bezerk.c and mmdf.c missing

it *inside* the appropriate routines.  Including it at the beginning
resulted in an error message stating that there was a duplicate

Oddly, this compiled just fine on a 9.05 system...

Yes, concatenating should work.  Save a copy of the originals and try it
to see if you like the results.  The index file will fix itself when you
use the new address book.

I would think that the best solution would be to have two address books
defined and keep them separate.  You don't need two separate .pinerc
files, just two address books in one pinerc.  See the address-book entry
in the Config screen.

You did not say which operating system you are using, but if you are 
using Unix then:
In the Pine configuration screen by defult your signature file should be set
.signature.  If this is true you can go into an editor emacs, pico, 
ect... there write a buffer with your e-mail address and anything else 
you want automatically displayed on your messages and save it as .signature.

then in the configuration screen set the signature-at-bottom selection.  
Your e-mail address will now be displayed on every message that you send out.

I am using PIne 3.93 as a test, this way I can still use 3.91. One thing 
that I find very annoying in 3.93 is that it will stop for a while and at 
the bottom of the screen it will say [Busy <|>].  What is it doing and is 
there a way that I can get it to stop doing that?

Thank you in advance.

Beth,
You seem to suggest that 3.93 is adding delays that didn't exist before,
but this isn't the case (or certainly not the intent).  The goal was
simply to provide some visible feedback when a particular operation is
taking a long time.  In the same situation, 3.91 just sits silently
without telling you anything.

In the configuration screen there is an option called 
enable-aggregate-command-set  this allows you to use the ';' command 
which selects by the messages number, date, text, status, or all.  Then 
you can apply the A command which is Apply. Here you can apply the 
commands Delete, Undelete, Reply, Forward, Print, take address, 
save, export,(bounce, flag, pipe if you have this setup as well)to the 
messages that you have selected.

Hope this helps!

Well, that should be quite self-explanatory: Before you are allowed to
compose a message, you have to connect to some Mail Server, which...

...currently has to be an IMAP server.

Hope this helps,

Just a tiny little point.  With something that is sent with PGP, you
probably don't want temp files in /tmp.  Even though they aren't going to
be readable.  I made a similar script (I like yours better, :-) and put
the temp files in ${PGPPATH}/.pgp.tmp.stderr.$$, etc.

Hello....I'm using Pine 3.93 compiled on a VMS system.  Sending/receving mail
works great, but I'm having a little difficulty reading mail.  Wen I put in
'gemini.tntech.edu', which is my domain, in the nntp server slot and try to go
into the mail folder it tells me "Can't connect to gemini.tntech.edu,119
connection refused"...
What does that mean, and how do I fix it?  Also, I'd like to read mail from my
brother's usenet groups with his provider...is there a way to transfer a
username and password with Pine on VMS?

On the bottom it will say someone is accessing scfn, then all of my email

In pico you can justify a paragraph using ^J.  In jpico
^J is `format' and I haven't been able to figure out how
to justify a paragraph.  Does anyone know?  Also, are 
there man pages for jpico?  If so, are they on the Web
anywhere?

Thanks,
Nancy

Not at all, the permissions are right, and both cat >/dev/null and
cat >>/dev/null from the command line work.

Error messages (more or less, they passed by quickly and I could only copy one
with the mouse:)
[Message append failed: Invalid argument]
Write to /dev/null failed

ls -l gives crw-rw-rw- (for special device, I assume.)
I guess pine is trying to seek to the end of the device, or something.

Greetings,
rjan.

Date: 21 May 1996 17:19:04 +0100
Message-Id: <4nsqdo$2hv@jupiter.fcrd.gov.uk>


I have just upgraded from Pine 3.91 to Pine 3.93 on my Sun SPARC system (running 
SunOS 4.1.3).

When I start up Pine, I get the message 'Incomplete maildomain "myhost."'. It used
to work fine with 3.91. Is there a configuration option I should have set? 

Can anyone help? I read the FAQ, but couldn't find anything about this.

Thanks in advance,

 Tim Porter

Make sure that enable-aggregate-command is X'd in Setup.Config
and then while viewing the index, type this:

  ;aadx

If you're viewing a news group, the messages will be marked read

Good luck,

I'm sorry to hear it.  In that case, I have a dumb follow-up question. 
How can one trace the header to find out the actual address of the sender?
Complaining to postmasters seems to have some effect, but the good trolls
hide their traces.  If this inquiry should be addressed to another group
then I apologise, but I figured that each newsreader will have a different
method to use. 

Thanks,

Get a faster modem ??? ... only a thought ... seriously for email I'm not
sure it makes a difference unless you can type faster than 2400 bps.  You
can buy a 14400 modem for +-50US$ or a 28800 for less that 100US$. 
Obviously modem speed makes a difference for newsreading or down/up/loads. 
I have a 286-16 with a 2400 modem running widows 3.0 , a 486-25 with a
14400 running windows 3.1, and a pentium-100 with a 28800 running
winblows95 and email works fine on all except that win95 can't pr(y)nt 
the email, but that's another story.  BYE

    I use ProComm Plus v2/DOS, and it _does_ let you choose, so to
speak.  It has a keyboard remapping facility (check the manual) which
allows you to remap the function keys, the numeric keypad, and so on. 
I remapped them to send out ^_, ^[, ^], and others as needed.  Quite
likely other professional-quality communications packages have
remapping capability as well.

Other people have answered your download question but I have a
comment about this part.  Did you know that you can use PC Pine
for Windows/Winsock to access your mail folders after you've
downloaded them to your PC?  I think you have to rename them so
they end with the .mtx extension (does anyone know if this is
required?) and then you can open them up in PC Pine.  They are
read-only but it's a great way to archive and retrieve old
messages.

Good luck,
Nancy

PS - Another option for storing mail messages on a PC is to
convert them to a Web of HTMLized messages using something
like MHonArc and then use your Web browser to access them.

Hi!
i'm looking for a good replacement of unix's mail/news system 
under nt. first i need uucp, which needs to work with tcp, too,
and something to replace C-News.
at last there's a need for a news-reader, something to replace
tin, nn, trn etc.

do you have an idea, how to implement this?

regards      
michael

    Dear People who know more than me ;),

    As you'll see when you get this email, in your index, it doesnt say
its "from me", but rather "To: You".  I didnt have this problem in the old
Pine.

    Anyone have any info on how to fix this?  

    Please email me, as I have no clue how to get on this mailing list.

    Thanx in advance.

Here's the short header from your message.  As you can see, it's clearly
from you:

Your name also showed in my Inbox index:

What you described is normal Pine behavior. It happens any time you send a
message that (for any reason) winds up back in your Inbox.  It can be
because you sent a message to a mailing list to which you subscribe, or
because you sent out a message and cc'd it to yourself, and there are
probably other scenarios as well. 
 
For example, I just sent a test message to "vicky" (a.k.a. "Victim User",
a dummy account here that we use for test purposes), with a cc to myself. 
Here's how it appeared in my Inbox index: 
 
  N  46 May 26 To: Victim User       (649) Test
  
Note that it shows up as "To: Victim User", not from me.  However the
message header shows clearly that I sent it, and in Victim User's Inbox
index it shows my name as sender.
 
Another example:  When I send this message, I'll get a copy back from the
list server at cac.washington.edu.  It will show up in my Inbox index as
"To:  pine-info", not as from me. 
 
This is the default behavior, but if I remember correctly it can be
altered when Pine is compiled.  Check with your System Administrator to
find out why he/she changed the default in the previous compilation but
not in the current one.  He/she may have installed the precompiled
binaries instead of compiling it locally.

    Thank you, and D.A <he knows who he is, just don't wanna give his name
out  without his ok ;) > for your quick responses and exact diagnosis of
what was wrong -- which was nothing ;).

    I feel kind of silly now, but I would have felt sillier if I had spent
the next month playing with my Config Pine command instead of asking.

    Thank you both for your quick help.

Subject: My "dumb" terminal can't clear screen
Date: Mon, 27 May 1996 03:31:32 GMT
Message-Id: <31a91fe0.4011306@news.dreamscape.com>

Hello,
   When I connect to my ISP and use my shell account to read news both
Tin & Pine give me a message that my terminal type is "dumb" and won't
allow the clear screen command.  I've tried using Terminate 4.0 (DOS),
NetTerm (32 Bit) and Qmodem Pro for Win95.  When I telnet in using
NetTerm with the same settings Pine & Tin work fine.  Pine & Tin also
work fine with all 3 programs using my wife's account with a different
provider.  Any suggestions on how to "smarten up" my programs?
Thanks,
Paul

I lurked through the posts still available on my reader and didn't see 
this tackled.  If I'm bringing up an old subject, please forgive.

I've been trying to post to newsgroups on Seattle Community Network (SCN) 
for about two months now.  Every post is bounced back to my files, and I 
get the message "sh xxxx Memory fault", where the x's are some random 
number.

The sysops are completely baffled.  What is this trying to tell me?

SCN is using Pine 3.92.  If there's more information you need to solve 
this, let me know and I'll try to gather it.

Thanks

Doug Reade

Your emulation programs (Terminate, NetTerm, etc.) should have a VT-100
emulation option.  Use it.  Also, you might add a line in your .profile
or .cshrc to set or prompt for terminal type vt100.  If your emulation
and shell environment are both set at vt100 mode, you should not have
trouble with Pine or other screen controlling programs.

Well, you could also have vt220, if available on both sides.

Just my 2c.

We are running PINE 3.92 and we have a permanent connection to our
Internet Service Provider by ISDN. When the ISDN line is down or the ISP
is off the air, PINE waits exactly 60 secs before firing up. Why? What do
we alter to reduce this annoying delay?

My limited experience (as in, I believe that is the setup we have around
here) tells me that this should be a mail exchange (MX record), not an
alias. Also, "mailserv." is not necessary, just "rz.fh-muenchen.de" will
do, and looks better in my opinion.

This has nothing to do with your communications programs.  You have to tell
your shell which terminal emulation you are using.  Check your comm. program
which terminal it is emulating, e.g. vt52, vt100, vt220, vt320, and then you
can define this on your shell.  The syntax you have to use on the shell
depends on which shell it is.  These two are the most common:

	setenv TERM vt100
	export TERM=vt100

Replace vt100 by the correct one in your case.

Good luck,

Hello,

Can anybody tell me how to setup the TERM if I want to invoke "pine" on
an IBM RS/6000 with AIX3.2 machine over a SUN workstation with the "openwin"?
There is no problem without the "openwin".
 
I have tried the following typies:

vt100, vt220, vt320, ansi, network, sun. This IBM machine does not have
"sun-cmd" type.

Thanks in advance!

I'm running Pine three different ways, all using a 14.4 kb/s modem in an
am5x86/133 PC with 16 MB of RAM. 

I can dial up to login to my ISP's UNIX shell and run Pine on my ISP's
system to access mail and news in my ISP's network. My PC is overkill for
that purpose, and Pine is running on an even faster machine. It's fast and
efficient. 

I downloaded PC-Pine for Windows a few days ago, and I'm using it on a
dial-up PPP connection to access my inbox on my ISP's system. The overhead
slows it down a bit. I start PC-Pine and the Winsock sets up the PPP link.
Five seconds after the noise from the modem stops, the Winsock window
closes, and ten seconds later Pine gives me a login prompt. I'm using
PC-Pine right now to write this message. It took 4 minutes to fetch the
list of newsgroups when I asked it to subscribe to comp.mail.pine, and it
took another 4 minutes to validate the newsgroups when I said I wanted to
compose a message to comp.mail.pine, but the editor is now running OK. 

Pine 3.91 came with the Slackware Linux distribution that I found on
tsx-11.mit.edu. I run pppd to set up a PPP link, and then invoke Pine. It
takes fully 36 seconds for Pine to give me a login prompt. It took 4
minutes to subscribe to comp.mail.linux, without having to fetch the
newsgroup list because it was already there. When I said I wanted to
compose a message, it took 4 minutes for Pico to respond to my down-arrows
to get me out of the Newsgrps line so I could enter the Subject. When I
accidentally up-arrowed to the Newsgrps line again, it took another 4
minutes to get out.

My question is: is this (a) just the difference between PC-Pine and Pine
3.91, (b) an error in my Linux configuration, or (c) something wrong with
my ISP's configuration?

Subject: default-saved-msg-folder = saved-messages  bug?
Date: 28 May 1996 06:17:58 GMT
Message-Id: <4oe5qm$9je@alpha.sky.net>

Hello,

Under setup/config (this is SunOS 5.5, pine 3.93), I specified
this option:

default-saved-msg-folder = saved-messages

Yet whenever I hit 's' after reading an e-mail to save it to
aforementioned saved-messages folder, by default, it instead prompts
me with a new folder name consisting of the e-mail address of the
sender (actually the first part, before the @). So I have to manually
type in 'saved-messages'. 

This was not a problem in our previous pine (3.91 or .92, never
really noticed which)... 

Am I missing something, or is this..... a bug?

Thanks in advance

Ken

When reading messages in Pine, is there a way to display the 
complete header (i.e. path, etc.)? I've looked through some FAQs 
and help files but I haven't managed to find an answer, so any 
help here would be appreciated.

Looks like you didn't check the Setup Configuration screen carefully
enough... :-)

	enable-full-header-cmd

When this is selected an "H" command is then available when viewing a
message to toggle display of full headers on/off.

Cheers,

Sure there is, but you'll have to configure Pine in order to use it:

-  Select enable-full-header-cmd in the Setup->Config screen
   (or add "enable-full-header-cmd" to your "feature-list=" in .pinerc).

-  Now you can toggle between regular and full-header mode by pressing
   "h" while viewing a message (or while you're in the Folder Index).

Regards,

- Richard Gering.

Is your DNS service through your ISP?  It's possible that this hang is in
trying to look up the local host name.

In addition to Mr Gering's excellent reply, may I offer our company's
solution to the same problem: we simply wrote a series and Unix scripts
that program and reset the arrow and other function keys, which I've
attached.  Install these in your local bin directory and then type "wpine"
instead of pine.

Our company could not use the Ansi terminal solution Mr. Gering described
(which is, as he says, the best solution) because of our commitment to
non-Ansi programs.

The only caveat with these scripts: if you use any kind of task-switching
program (like mscreen) you will find your function keys don't work in the
other tasks.  Switch back to pine, exit, then switch to the other task.

Hope this helps.  Good luck.

We are experiencing a small problem when printing email messages received 
from one particular address. All other messages print normally. The 
problem occurs when printing a message originating from 
..@cedar.grad.washington.edu. The message displays normally on screen, 
but when printed out, each paragraph is printed on one line so is 
truncated on output. This doesn't happen with any other messages and the 
support staff at the Grad school say it is our printer.

Do you know of any fix or workaround for this? Thanks in advance.

I've seen the ability to forward email mentioned in some of the online
documentation for PINE, but I've not been able to fine the procedure
detailed.

I have a new email account, and I'd like to automatically forward all
incoming messages to this new account.  Is this something PINE can
handle?  If so, how do I do it?

Thanks very much.

Mark,
I notice that cedar.grad.washington.edu is an NT box.  This suggests
that you may be receiving mail from a Microsoft mail program.
One of the things we've noticed about Microsoft mail programs is that they
have the nasty habit of sending entire paragraphs as a single line in the
mail message. 

When you display such a message, Pine will wrap the long lines on the
screen, but I don't believe does so for printing... You could test this
(and work-around the problem) by printing via a filter that wraps long
lines.

If this hypothesis is correct, the Microsoft software is clearly at fault,
but I don't know what the odds are of getting it fixed.  I suppose a case
could also be made for Pine to auto-wrap on printing...

dear tim
	sure, go to the config area thru the setup from the main menu(i am
assuming you know how to do that!!) and in the second field enter the
complete domain name that you would like your mail header to contain that
is i suppose in your case would be fcrd.gov.uk  .this is to ensure that
replies to your mail can be sent in the reply mode.what happens is that
pine picks up the domain name from your /etc/sendmail.cf file  and
attaches it to your name and sets this as the header on your outgoing
mail.in case your domain name is incomplete then reply to mails that you
send may not reach you in the reply mode. hence this entry. once entered
pine does not look up the sendmail file(i think) but for the user sake it
sends out his correct email address in the "from" entry on the outgoing
mail.
	this should fix up the problem for you.incase you wish to set it
up for all your users then create a global pine.conf file and put this
entry there.

Well, as Walter Cronkite would have said, "That's the way it is" ... sorry
if you don't understand the Cronkite reference, but that's the way pine

It's not a PINE question but a UNIX question but try this:  type ! or
maybe ^Z then if you see a unix propmt (which might be a % or something
depending on how yer system works) type fg (enter) which should bring the

I'd like to make a request to the Pine developers for a small
additional feature in future versions of Pine.  I've checked the Pine
Web pages and the FAQ, but I can't find an email address that
specifically calls for requests.  Does anyone know of such an address?

The feature I'd like to request is a Config option to specify the name
of the dead.letter file.  I'd like to be able to change "dead.letter"
to something like ".dead.letter".  That way, the file would be hidden
during Unix file listing.

	You could, if you read the "help"....

        FEATURE: enable-mouse-in-xterm

This feature controls whether or not an X terminal mouse can be used with
Pine.  If set, and the $DISPLAY variable indicates that an X terminal is
being used, the left mouse button on the mouse can be used to select text
or commands.

Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of xterm cut-and-paste is also
modified.  It is necessary to hold the shift key down while clicking left
or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.

In passing, note that "dead.letter" is presumably being used as this is
the same filename used by a number of other UNIX mail programs.  The
oft-quoted BSD mail program (usually the command "Mail") uses exact same
filename (and presumably file format).

The advantage, obviously, is that one can postpone a message in one mailer
and resume it in another.

Ok, I just noticed that I missed something here.  You have to tell it also,
which display it should come up on.  Here a example.  Assume the network
name of the sun is "sun" and of the RS6k it is "aix".  Assume that your
username is NOT identical on both machines, say it is "aaa" on the sun and 
"bbb" on the RS6k.  Assume that the xterm program is in /usr/X11/bin and 
that pine is in /usr/local/bin.  These things are probably all different
in your case, so you have to put in the right values.  Now assume further,
that you are on the console of the Sun.

1.

Log into the RS6k with telnet or however.  Then issue the following command:

xterm -display sun:0 -e /usr/local/bin/pine

and pine comes up on the sun.  "sun:0" is the display of the console.

2.

Make a menu entry in the menu file on your home dir, i.e. $HOME/.openwin-menu.
Put in the following line:

"Pine" exec rsh aix -l bbb /usr/X11/bin/xterm -display sun:0 -e /usr/local/bin/pine

If your username is the same on both sun and aix, then you can ommit the 
"-l bbb".

In order to make rsh work, i.e. log in w/o password, you have to create a 
file $HOME/.rhosts on aix, i.e. on the RS6k.  It should contain only one 
line:

sun aaa

(Machine, your login on that machine).  But PLEASE read the man page 

	man rhosts

'coz there are naturally some security concerns.  Don't be afraid, but
know about it.

Once again, good luck.

Ah, thanks.  I've even reported a bug before, and I never noticed that
third option.

A new server, the `jkm105-server' is installed. Due to a new programming
technique, this server achieved a certain superiority. Data-flow

The jkm105-server is operating nearly for all countries.
The jkm105-server transmits also in the short wave region, mainly at 37 MHz.
Thus, jkm105-server does not need Satellites for wireless communication.

Best wishes, jkm105-server-group.

A new server, the jkm105-server is installed. Due to a new programming
technique, this `jkm105-server' has achieved a certain superiority.
The jkm105-server enhances the data-flow severely.

The data-flow rate achieved by this new server is really astonishing.
No waiting in the Internet and other networks will be necessary in the
near future.

Hi!

I just downloaded pine 3.93 and I need some help to get it functional.

I am running on an SCO Openserver 5 system.

When I send mail to root@megasys.uucp I get the following errors:

POSTING ERROR RESULT: (USER) Unknown user name in "Undisclosed 
recipients:;

Posting program /usr/lib/sendmail -oem -t -o; returned error

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Can someone help?

I have installed PC-Pine and imap-4.BETA on SunOS4.01.  The UNIX server 
has no problem with SMTP with current applications, but when used with 
PC-Pine to send error 250 occurs and both Sendmail(UNIX) and 
Mercury(Novell) report problem with quit or close.

Any ideas on how to remedy this?

Regards

Anwar Bashir

Hello folks,

i wonder how i make pine3.93 use the rsh/remsh mechanism instead
of the non-authorized way with port 143.
I tried to execute 'remsh remotehost /etc/rimapd' and it works,
but pine always asks me for username and password. What's wrong ?
inbox-path is set to {remotehost.mydomain}inbox.

Greets, Sven

Dear Pine Staff,
	My PINE used to work just great before
this new version.... Now the margins and all that
are really messed!!!!!  Every time I compose a
message and try to use the arrow keys the header

How do you go about interfacing PGP with pine?

Sawasdee (hello in Thai),

I face this problem too. I don't know the real reason! but I can correct
it for myself by use S-SETUP command and change config in the second line
"user-domain" to mydomain. It can correct this problem.

But this method don't fix the problem of every user!!

This is a known problem for SCO systems that are not configured to use
SMTP (i.e. the default configuration). It is fixed in the next release.

For the time being, you can try to configure Pine to use SMTP.  To do
this, go to Setup->Config menu and enter "localhost" at the stmp-server
option. This should be sufficient to allow you to send mail. 

Let me know if this doesn't help you.

    Probably you cannot.  Pine seems to be designed to transmit and
receive straight ASCII text (with the possibility of 8-bit character
sets).  To accomplish underlining or italicization, you would need to
transmit control characters along with your text.  The problem is that
unless you are operating in a very tightly controlled environment, you
have no control over the hardware and software any particular recipient
is using, and different control characters could do different things to
various recipients, including a hard lockup.

    This seems to be the situation with email and newsgroups in
general.  If you want fancy features, you need to go to the World Wide
Web and graphical browsers.

Si pone usted "enable-suspend" en la configuracio'n, ud. puede empujar

I'll bet you have the config option 'saved-msg-name-rule' set to one of
the fcc options - if so, this is indeed a new behaviour, though not a
'bug': In prior versions, the fcc-of-(whichever) only worked if the
address matched one in your addressbook(s), with a defined fcc -
otherwise, it returned to the default-saved-msg-folder value.  In 3.93,
the fcc options instead default to the behaviour of the by-from option,
and so on each new address on a saved message, it attempts to make a
folder for the user-name portion of the From: address;  the
default-saved-msg-folder value is only used where no From: can be
identified, such as a save of multiple messages from different authors
using Select/Apply. 

I personally find this change less than helpful, since I like one 'pile'
of saves in saved-messages, except for those for whom I've defined a
special fcc in my addressbook.  I also thought it was a bug at first, and
passed it on to the pine development folks - I'm hoping it'll be 'fixed'
in time for the public release of 3.94, but of course I can't speak for
them.

If you are NOT using an option (other than default-folder) under the
saved-msg-name-rule, I'd be fascinated it's doing this - please advise in
that case.

Cheers,

     Pine is trying to use the IMAP port to access your INBOX folder.  The 
server that has your INBOX on it does not however permit IMAP connections.  
Talk to your sys admin or get a mail reader that uses the POP protocol.

Hello:

The command in PINE to display full headers while viewing a message is 
H - the catch is that it has to be turned on in your .pinerc settings.  

To do this, go to the PINE main menu [M], then select [S]etup, then
[C]onfig (in each case using the letter in []) - scroll down to the option

Can someone please send me the little .xbm file and instructions on how to
set it up as the default icon for my Pine window?

I remember seeing this a looong time ago.

Thanks!

I'm not familiar with how the Pine mail file operates, but I have noted that if 
I have Netscape Atlas 2.0 running while I access Pine via telnet to my Unix 
shell account that I get occasional file access errors to my mail file.  In 
addition, I note that if I bring the Netscape POP mail program up just to 
examine previously downloaded mail (without atempting to check current mail), 
quit Netscape, and then Telnet to Pine in Unix shell, my Pine mail file 
regularly blows away dumping all mail.

Since I'm a novice on the technicals, what's causing this?  Is it particular to 
POP mail in general, Netscape, Pine, or the mail server configuration?

Thanks for the insight.

You found the cause of the problem.  That "term: Undefined variable" is
what's preventing rimap from working.  The most likely culprit is
something in a .cshrc or similar file.

It may have been "coming from stderr" on the server, but there's no
difference between stderr and stdout from the perspective of the rsh
client.

I've had a couple of emails with useful replies in them - and a couple

Thanks again for your help folks.

From: Laurence Lundblade <lgl@island-resort.com>

This is because Pine doesn't use Content-Disposition to indicate whether 
the text part is an attachment or inline and Eudora assumes all text 
parts that are not marked as attachments are inline.  Ideally changes 
would be made to both programs to improve this situation. 

Pine could be fixed to specify the correct Content-Disposition. This is 
planned for the next major release (I asked them last week).
  
      (maybe 6 mths to a year.....)

Eudora would be changed so it offers some way to save parts of the 
message to files even if they are inline just as Pine does. 

Technically speaking neither one is violating any standards.

I don't have any great ideas how you can change this other than some how 
convince Pine that the thing you are attaching is not actually text. 
There may be a way to do this with the mailcap configuration file, but I 
don't know off-hand.  



I  asked a couple more newbie questions and;

Sure, how about the Pine newsgroup comp.mail.pine, the Pine home page 
http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine, or the Pine documentation. From a 
quick look I think the answer is to use the mime.types.  Haven't tried 
this, but take the text file you're gonna attach, decide on an extension 
for them (e.g., decide you're gonna make all files end in ".atc" and 
rename them to that).  Then put a line of the format 
       application/octet-stream           atc
 in your .mime.types file.  If you have the full Pine distribution you can 
find a sample mime.types file.

The protection of /var/spool/mail should be set to 1777; that is, public
write with the sticky bit.

You didn't get this message with 3.91 because 3.91 ignored this error
condition.  Ignoring it prevents locking against mail delivery when Pine
is rewriting the mailbox, resulting in lost mail or damaged mail files.
That's why 3.93 doesn't ignore it any more.

As for why it was ignored, it was falsely represented to me many years ago
that 775 protections on /var/spool/mail only occur on systems in which
sendmail uses flock() instead of .lock files for locking.

The answer lies in the fact that it isn't a "Pine mail file", it's your
UNIX mail file.  All mail received for you on your UNIX host is appended
by sendmail to your personal mail file (/usr/mail/ltribley,
/var/mail/ltribley or similar, depending on how your system is
configured).  That is what Pine reads as your "Inbox", and it is also what
the POP3 server accesses when you use Netscape Atlas or any other POP
client to collect new mail.  For obvious reasons it isn't a good idea to
allow two apps to access (and potentially alter) your mail file at the
same time, so it is locked by the accessing app. 
 
If you have your POP client configured to gather new mail at regular
intervals, and if you are trying to use Pine at the same time, then you
will get an error from either Pine or the POP client, depending on which
gets control of the mail file first.

If you have your POP client set to delete old mail from the server, then
it removes any messages that aren't flagged "new" from your UNIX mail
file.  This will include any mail your POP client has downloaded as well
as any mail you have read (but not deleted) in Pine.
 
Again, the key is the fact that Pine and your POP client are both
accessing the same mail file.  This can cause a great deal of confusion
unless the user understands how all the pieces interact.  We suggest the
following to our users: 
 
The simplest course of action is to use Pine exclusively or a POP client
exclusively.  If the user reads his e-mail from several access points
(i.e. not always from the same Mac or PC), we suggest that he stick with
Pine.  If he always reads his mail from the same Mac or PC via a PPP or
network connection, we recommend Pine or a POP client, but not both.
Otherwise he will end up with some message in one place, other messages
in another place, and nine times out of ten the end result is headaches
for the user _and_ our help desk staff.
 
If the user insists on using both Pine and a POP client, we recommend that
the POP client be configured to leave mail on the server.  That way he can
still read it in Pine if he chooses to do so.  However, we caution people
who do this to use Pine to delete read mail from their Inboxes on a
regular basis.  Otherwise their mail files continue to grow to the point
where I have to send a "clean it out or else" nastygram.

Hi, pine users (and developers ;-)!

Is it possible to forward message as MIME-enapsulated? Sometimes it is
desirable to preserve full message structure, espicially in case of
multipart messages with attachments.

If it is not possible currently (3.93) could it be considered as feature
request?

Thanks in advance

Thanks,

I think that the problem may be partly due to my DNS. I have a dial-up modem 
link to the Internet, and I think the delay is being caused by DNS lookups.

However, I *didn't* have this problem under Pine 3.91.

Looking at the Pine code, I think that the relevant program is send.c, in
pine3.93/pine. But I don't have the programming knowledge to investigate it
further. Can anyone offer any help?? 

Regards,

  Tim Porter

    It is not necessary always to open the folder for a particular
newsgroup to which you wish to post.  Merely be somewhere in the
folders listing.  Press 'C' for (C)ompose.  If the 'Newsgroups:' header
is not visible, just press Ctrl-R (^R) for (R)ich Headers to get the
Newsgroups: header.  Then just cheerfully fill in all the newsgroup
names you want, separated by commas.  (As a side comment, one should
always use discretion when cross-posting and do so only when there is a
genuine need or value for it.  As a thread goes on, sometimes the
followups can become irrelevant to some of the newsdgroups, but people
tend to be lazy and not trim the newsgroup list.)

	They are the same as a .pinerc file.

	If you type "pine -h" you will see one of the selections is

 -pinerc <file> Configuration - Put fresh pinerc configuration in <file>

	This will give you the file you need.  Simply edit it to be
what you want and name it and place it where it should go.

That is a bug that will be fixed in 3.94.  If all goes well we hope to
have 3.94 out by the end of next week.

You produce default versions of these files by running:

pine -conf > pine.conf
pine -conf > pine.info
pine -conf > pine.conf.fixed

Produce them in /usr/local/lib.

You may then edit the pine.conf to your needs.

Probably a little more convenient than "pine -pinerc" is "pine -conf".
The -pinerc option gives a cleaned up version of your own pinerc file.
The -conf option gives a cleaned up version of the global pine.conf file,
which will have nothing set in it if you don't already have one.  Also,
some of the variables can be set in pine.conf but not in pinerc, so the
available set of variables will be slightly different in the two cases.
You don't need to have a pine.conf unless there are global defaults that
you want to set for everybody.  You don't need a pine.conf.fixed unless
there are variables that you want to set so that users can't override
them.

pine.conf
---------
A file suitable for modification can be created by running Pine with the
"-conf" command line option and redirecting the output to the file.  This
is described in the man page for Pine.

pine.conf.fixed
---------------
Copy the settings of any items you want to "fix" systemwide out of
pine.conf into pine.conf.fixed.  This file is optional; if it doesn't
exist or is empty all values can be changed by users in their personal
settings.

pine.info
---------
A text file you create.  Its content will be inserted within the first
screenful or so of Pine's main help screen ("?" at the Main Menu).

Aaarrgghh!  No ...

What you say is true for pine.conf.

However producing a pine.conf.fixed in this way would "fix" every single
value (apart from the feature-list).  It's much easier to vreate this file
only if you want to fix any values, and then by copying the relevant
settings over from the pine.conf file.

The pine.info file is a help file, and so should not contain the output of
a "pine -conf" command.  This file's content is inserted in Pine's Main
Menu Help text.

**** Dumb New User Question Alert! ****

I use pine to view multiple newsgroups (including this one).  How do I
have pine keep track of msgs I've already viewed, then when I reenter the
newsgroup at a later date, show me previously read msgs or (better!) jump
to the next unread msg?

TIA

The only thing that I can think of when folders say Read Only is when 
either you or someone else has your Pine running on another computer.  
Which ever Pine was logged into last will be read/write on that computer 
and if it is running on another computer it will become read only.  If 
you are not logging into another computer and not realizing that you are 
still logged on then you have no problem.  If you think someone else is 
logging on and reading you mail you may have a problem.
 
If you are using Unix for pine I can tell you how to set your permissions 
for your mail not to be read by others.
Let me know and I will explain.

I would like to limit user's to only search their current workspace and 
it's sub-directories.  I.e user's home directory: "/usr/home/0/mike" and 
I want them to work in it and any others contained in it! I want to stop 
them from going up to /usr/home/0/.  How can I do that in Pine 3.9.3?  I 
have the source code and am willing to edit it.  I just would like a 
suggestion on how it should be done.

Please mail me back at my home address!

I can't get a lock file created on /var/spool/mail/whatever using 3.93.  I never

I took a quick look through the most recent FAQs and didn't see anything on this (is
there a search system?).  Sorry if this has been discussed and I missed it.

Hi,

This problem started when our site moved to Pine 3.92(UNIX). Everytime 
I (R)eply to a message, I get asked 
"Reply to all recepients?" even though I am the only
 one recepient. It really annoys me, but I couldn't find any options under 
"Config" to disable that. Maybe somebody knows how to get rid of that inquiry?
Thanks for help,

Create a file in your directory called ".forward".  (without the quotes)  
In it, write the email address you want your mail forwarded to.  Like this:

(pico .forward)

jderouen@crl.com

(save file)

By doing this, any incoming mail would then be forwarded to 
"jderouen@crl.com."  You may include as many email address as you want in 
the list, but never, ever include the account you're trying to forward 
from's email address.  (lest you create an endless loop)

Hope this helps.

I will have to answer in Enlish, which your sig and your "real" names
suggests you are fully competent in.  It would simply take
me too long to write an answer in Spanish.

The question as I understand it is:

  Does anyone know how to leave pine to a unix shell without having
  to quit?

There is no direct way of getting to a SUB-shell in pine (there is
no "!" mechanism), but for any version of unix and unix shells
that allow job control (suspending jobs) you can use Ctrl-Z to
get back to a shell.  When you wish to return to pine, just type
"fg" to the shell prompt.

You may have to enable a pine feature called something like
"enable-suspend-cmd".

Using ctrl-Z is much better than the old fashioned
shell escape mechanism of many other Unix interactive programs, and
I suspect that the pine developers knew exactly what they were doing
when they did not put in a shell escape (other than suspend) into
pine.

I have got a simular problem. The error occures when sending, replying,
forwarding or bouncing. I narrowed the bug down to the size of the email I
was forwarding (and I checked the same email with 3.91, it worked): 10,746
bytes still worked, 11,692 bytes didn't work. I understand you need
details: I also didn't change the compile options, but I striped the
resulting binaries. We have a mixture between HP/UX 9.05 and 9.01, but I
compiled on a 9.05 maschine (thor from below). I include some responses
from our system about it's versions from both 9.05 and 9.01:

Senor:

Lo siento, pero mi Espanol no es bueno - pero, trato aqui a explicar lo
que Ud.  necessita.  Para salir de PINE al shell, Ud. puede usar ' Ctrl-Z
'.  Pero este necessita que un 'feature' - 'enable-suspend' esta
selectado:  M - main menu; S - setup; C - config;  busca 'enable-suspend'
y lo selecta con X; al fin, E - exit, y Y para decir 'si'.

Buena suerte con eso! :->
