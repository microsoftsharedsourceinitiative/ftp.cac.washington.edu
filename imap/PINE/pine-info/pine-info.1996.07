In a previous article I had asked about POP capability in PC Pine. I
understand it is not there now, but is there any plans to put POP mail
capability into PC Pine in a future release. Even if I've found an ISP that
has IMAP capability, accessing IMAP over a dial in type access can be rather
slow. I'd rather download all my messages and read them directly on the PC,
while maintaining access to remote folders using IMAP. In other words I want
both types of access - POP for my my inbox and IMAP for my folders. This
would be the best of both worlds for my situation.

It *REALLY* helps if, when you describe such problems you also include:

*  Which version of Pine you are using: 3.91? 9.92? 9.93? 3.94?

*  The platofrm your Pine is running on (DOS? Windows? Some flavour of
   UNIX?)

ANYWAY....

Guessing from the Message ID header field of your posting that you are
still using Pine 3.91 I suspect you are having your problems from having
an existing-but-empty postponed messages folder or interrupted mail
folder.

Check these (using "ls -l" if you are on a UNIX system)...

	ls -l $HOME/.pine-interrupted-mail
	ls -l $HOME/mail/postponed-msgs

(replace "/mail/" with the name of the subdirectory in which your folders
are stored if different).

If either of these exist but are empty delete them.

The better solution is to upgrade to the current version of Pine (3.94)
which, I believe, does not suffer from the problem.

Cheers,

Hi everybody,
Yes, I'd really (gasp) like to turn off the automatic mail check of pine.
It confuses the mail checking mechanism of the CDE environment. Alternatively,
it would also be enough to be able to set the intervall to a looong period.
BTW, I'm using PINE3.91.

Thanks,
          Dirk

: I've got .addressbook* and pine-address* files in my $HOME..... do  
: I need them both anymore?

pine 3.94 uses .addressbook* files just the same way, so if you want to
keep your same addressbook, you should keep the files.  It is compatible.

Is there a way to take my Pine Address Book, and import it into Netscape

Usually I use Pine, but sometimes I am browsing in Netscape, and want to
send a message....but no access to my carefully compiled Pine Address
Book!

Also, is there a Netscape UseNet group like this one for Pine? I can't
find it, and that seems like a real surprise.

Many thanks,

Hi all,
is it possible to tell pine not to put the included original message,

maessage text? I'd like to have it at the beginning followed
by the cursor position and the signature.

Any hints or ideas?

Message-Id: <4r8nrg$3m5@pf1.phil.uni-sb.de>

Hi,
I'm running pine 3.94 with the following pgp display filters:
display-filters=_LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MES")_
/usr/local/bin/pgpwrap,
 _LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP MES")_ /usr/local/bin/pgp -mf,
_LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY")_ /usr/local/bin/pgp -kaf

pgpwrap is:
#!/bin/sh

pgp

echo "">/dev/tty
echo "     -------- Press [RETURN] to continue --------" >/dev/tty
read junk </dev/tty
exit 0

So it gives me a pause after checking the sign.

Everything works quiet good for all mails signed with pgp directly.

Unfortunately some of the guys here want to use elm. So I installed elm
2.4me+ which is able to pgp sign an encrypt.
The problem is now, that this elm tries to use a defacto standard for mime
encoded pgp mails.
The header looks like this:
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4ME+ PL19 (25)]
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: application/pgp; format=text; x-action=sign
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Do someone know how to fix this problem in pine, cause I don't want to
patch elm, cause the others want to use this defacto standard, but I want
to read my mails with pine.

Thats all,
           Schlumpf.

Try looking in Pine's Setup Configuration screen (use the Setup command at
the main menu).  Look through the various things you can set (using the
built-in help if necessary).  The one of particular interest to you is
"signature-at-bottom".

However setting it means you revert back to forcing your readers to wade
through included old text before getting to your interesting new comments.
The default is chosen deliberately so that the new material is presented
first, with the old stuff there if necessary (but not dominating the
message).

Cheers,

SYSTYPE should be getting set in makefile.xxx in the pine
subdirectory.

I don't know if this will help you, but I have written simple urldecoder
in C.  If you can convince the system administrator at the school to
compile it for you (or maybe you can do it in your personal directory),
call it urldecode and put it in a bin directory.  Then when you see the
above message, press pipe (|) and type in urldecode.  You will see your
message in plain text.

I guess there's also a way to get this setup in the new mailcap file.  I
don't know how to do this, though.  Good luck.

I've attached the source code.  You can also get it at

	ftp.teleport.com/vendors/masi/pickup

if that's your cup of tea.

(To real C coders: please don't laugh at my code, I'm just a beginner.  Is
there a standard header file for hex to int conversion?  I couldn't find
one, so I wrote it.)

Hello!

When I press "R" for reply to a message, then I get these ">" characters in
front of each line of the original message.  When I want to reformat those
lines with "CTRL-J", this works fine.  Great feature!

Then I postpone this message, and continue writing later.  Then pico is not
in "rply mode" and the "CTRL-J" does not work in quoted text anymore.  Can
I send pico into reply mode by hand, like in emacs when I say "M-x tex-mode"
or something like that?

Another consequence is that the original article will not get the "A" tag
for an answered mail anymore, which I find not too bothering...

Did I miss something, or does pine miss something???

Gloria, welcome to the world of Windows GPF errors.  In my past 
experience, most GPFs originate from a corrupt video driver, no matter 
the syptoms (I once had a Word for Windows crashing situation whenever a 
printing was called for....replacing the video driver fixed it).
 
In your present situation, though, my recommendation would be to simply 
take 15 minutes, and remove your printer driver for your HP DJ 600, and 
re install it from the installation diskette.  You could also do this for 
your 28.8 fax modem, if you wish.  I would lay bets that it should fix 
your troubles.
 
If that doesn't work, try re-installing your video driver.  :)

Brad,
That message would appear to be a futile and doomed attempt to merge
uuencode and MIME technology.  The MIME spec defines several
Content-Transfer-Encodings, but X-UUENCODE (or even UUENCODE) is not one
of them, and I'm pretty sure it never will be.  (I believe there is an
appendix in the MIME spec that explains why Base-64 encoding was chosen
over uuencode, by the way.) 

People who are sending MIME attachments with MIME headers should use MIME
(B64 or QP) encoding!!!  If backwards compatibility with uuencode is
needed, I'd recommend sending a conventional uuencoded message, without
trying to pretend it is a valid MIME CTE.

Do you know what mailer is attempting to perpetrate this evil?

         Please reply directly to:
         dw@freenet.npiec.on.ca

With Pine 3.93:
Is it possible for a person to send email to
the Pine 3.93 inbox and have it BEEP several
times versus the usual one BEEP ?

This would be used to signal special email has arrived.

Thanks in advance for any help.
Cheers!

	When the confirmation for delete of messages comes back to me, it
uses the word "EXPUNGE" !   It is not immediately apparent just what will
happen if I answer "yes" or "no" to this request.  Do you know what
"expunge" means.  And can you tell me what the "yes" and "no" answers will
do?
And can you change that message so that I don't have to curse you every
time I can't remember whether "expunge" means "to take out" or "get rid
of"  or "destroy" ...... !?!

Whoever wrote that message should have to answer this note --- and all
other hate mail over any other confusions your system has intentionally
built in.

U'all

	I am a single user of pine on a stand alone PC home computer that I use 
for all sorts of personal, business and volunteer purposes. I have been 
using pine since Oct 95.

	There is no(?) explanation of the need/source/.. of the Sender/X-Sender 
line in the header file. For ordinary e-mail, this does not interfere with 
message transmission. My "sys-adm's" computer uses pine, he doesn't get this line,
and we can figure out why.  However, when trying to do a batch {archie}, the return 
message gets sent to a non-existent address. 

	How do I turn this line off absolutely?

	How do I make this line conform to an address I can absolutely specify?

	How do I get around this line?

	Help me ask the right question.

Sounds like a place to use one of the many handy features of PINE:

            [ ]  expunge-without-confirm              =20

mark that with an X to set (yes, I know it would make more sense =
to have "S" mean "set")

If it helps any, think of these words:
	exit	      	- to go out
	excommunicate	- to cast out
	extract		- to pull out
	exodus		- to go out

That's how I remember it (no joke).

	Is there a way to have the news items one has read marked as 
such, even after exiting and re-entering Pine. In other words all new 
items are marked as new every time I open Pine. This makes finding where 
I left off in any particular group tiring.

Subject: X-Face or picon support
Date: 27 Jun 1996 09:00:51 -0700
Message-Id: <4qub7j$glq@pollux.usc.edu>

It would be really neat if elm supported the X-Face header line.  This
line contains an encoded compressed 48x48 bit image.  (Actually, it
would be nice if all mail user agents supported X-Face.  Some, including
exmh and meuf already do.)

An option should list a file from which to get the X-Face data.  If this
option is filled, the X-Face header line should be included in all sent
mail.

An option should be provided to list a program which can display the
X-Face.  Another option should be provided to control how faces are
displayed when an X-Face header line is encountered in mail being read.
Possible options might be always, never, or on-demand.  The program
should be spawned appropriately and fed the X-Face data on stdin.

Software for using and generating X-Face data is archived at
ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/faces/index.html

A brief description of how to generate X-Face data is given at
http://www.miranova.com/~steve/xemacs-miscellaneous.html#Q5_3_10

I am not aware of any RFC that discuses any standards for the X-Face
header line, or anything similar.  If there isn't one, then perhaps one
should be written.

X-Face header lines should be of very reasonable length, because only
288 bytes would be needed even without compression.  However, X-Face
images have a bit depth of only 2; they are monochrome images.  They
don't look all that nice.  There is another standard, the picon
standard, that allows each bit to take on either one of 16 grayscale
values, or one of 32 colours.  This allows for very nice looking and
recognizable pictures.  Even this is not excessive; picons should take
less than 1.5kB, and they can be transmitted in less than 1 second on a
28.8 kB/s modem.  Any standard should support 1, 4, or 5 bits/pixel.

Date: 1 Jul 1996 22:53:49 GMT
Message-Id: <4r9ktt$375@stratus.skypoint.net>

I would appreciate any help with this topic:
 
I'm currently using Pine v3.91, under a Unix shell account. 
 
I'm trying to start an abuse.recovery mail listing with a select group of 
people through the internet (we'd rather do it from mail than go to a 
news group, as it's too "public" and flaming, etc. - not a 'safe' place).
 
I thought somehow supported the ability to redirect new messages coming 
in to a different folder.  If so, can anyone tell me how?  Simply, if the 
subject of a specific message contains a special string, I'd like it to 
get tossed to a different folder other than INBOX.
 
What I'd *really* like is an ability for it to automatically forward 
those special letters to a distribution list I've created in my address book.
 
Scenario:
   1. A letter from one of the "group" comes into my mailbox.
   2. Pine recognizes it is a "group" letter, and either:
          A. tosses it to a special folder (so that I can bounce it to
             the distribution list in my addressbook manually).
      
                         or
          B. automatically bounces/forwards it to the distribution
             list that's in my addressbook.
 
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I just have to believe this is 
possible, especially if the "vacation" thingy works in Unix.
 
Again, it's Pine v3.91, unix shell environment.  Responses can either be 
here, or via email: jgross@skypoint.com
 
Thanks a ton.

If you delete a file on your computer system (and a folder of messages is
just stored in a file) then your ONLY hope is to contact your systems
manager and ask -- very nicely -- if they take security copies of the
disks from time to time and, if so, could they possibly restore your file.

Be warned, however, that these copies may only be taken once or twice a
week, so you may not get a terribly up-to-date copy of the file back
(assuming they're willing to do such a restore "just" for e-mail).

Cheers,

"Expunge" is a perfectly valid English word meaning (pauses to reach for
the dictionary on his shelf) "erase, destroy".

Of course there is... and it is described in the built-in help available
at Pine's Main Menu (in the section entitled "Reading News" -- hint: once
you have the help screens up give the "W" (Where) command to search for
the string "Reading News").

I've tried setting up the send and display filters of PC-Pine for 
Windows (32-bit) so that sending PGP messages would become easier.

Pine accepts the filters, but acts like they don't exist. Are the 
filters not functional in PC-Pine? Why? 

I understand that there might be problems with Win16 API, but it should 
be possible to implement the filters with Win32 API.

What other functionalities are missing from the PC-Pine?

Well, that pretty much says it all.  When one is away, how does one set 
up an autoresponse informing others to contact someone else in the 
office--so they won't wonder why they're getting no response for 10 days.

Thanks.

Jason,

This is really possible. You need to have any mail filter program
installed, e.g. procmail. Some simple configuration rules should be
set in order to have different messages either stored in separate folders,
redirected to other users or not stored at any place.

I use procmail in Unix. The following is an excerpt from my .procmailrc file:

# setting of environment variables

MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/procmail.log
VERBOSE=on

# Direct all messages from Arutz 7 into the appropriate folder

Oh yes.  Eudora 2.1.1 for Windows.
What's even worse was that it was originally attempting to mail the

It's a stupid little text file!  Why does it feel the need to do

Short answer:  This is nothing to do with Pine (which is only for reading
messages AFTER they have been delivered).

Longer answer:  Instead you have to persuade the mail delivery software
your computers use to generate the automatic reply.  UNIX systems
typically have a program called "vacation" to do this.  Try doing a "man
vacation" to read its manual page on how it is used.  If you need further
assistance (problems understanding the man page, vacation not installed on
your system, etc) try asking your local support centre (who'll know far
better than us random people around the world what software they have
installed on their computers:-)

Brad,
There are reasons to encode text files... Pine does it too.  (The problem
is that the Internet mail infrastructure is not completely 7bit clean,
much less 8bit clean, so even ascii text files can be corrupted.)

But I think that promulgating this "X-UUENCODE" CTE is pretty egregious.
(As is using binhex --though I thought that was configurable in Eudora.)

I've just started using Pine 3.91 and came across what sounds identical. 
Below is listed what I posted to our local help desk:

Pine will normally access the local file structure seeking the sent-mail
file.  However, if the pinerc has been modified to include a ftp site, as in:
*{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]
and this occurs first in the folder-collection, then Pine will abort.

Solution:
Delete file named core from users directory.
Make certain sent-mail file location occurs first in folder-collections,
as in:
mail/[]

Either make sure the directory that contains the executable is in your PATH,
or cd to the directory and run "./pine".

Also, do you have an a.out or an ELF system?  Again, you may be trying
to run an ELF binary on an a.out system.  Try compiling the source code
yourself.  It's fun!

Hi!

Well, we updated about three weeks ago and NOW realized something is amiss
         (everything is send with sender '@<user>@<domain>' TWO 'AT' signs),
AND I updated the configs too. NOW the old Version behaves erratic too,
so it must be in the updated configs, so I'll have to get the configs
back from tape.

SO, IF YOU UPDATE,  ***SAVE*** the old progs AND configs !!!

Just an idea,    Stucki

I use the elm filter feature with pine to filter incomming e-mail into 
several different folders.  

My problem is that I cannot tell when I have new mail because it is 
automatically moved from my INBOX to the folders I have specified.

Is there a way for me to have pine indicate that new mail has been 
delivered and in to what folder it was placed??

Subject: Win95 Pine with Emacs as alternate editor
Date: 27 Jun 1996 23:32:02 GMT
Message-Id: <4qv5li$shd@ss.netgate.net>

Hi again,

Moving along in the struggle to make Win95 usable to a Unix dweeb... I have
downloaded and successfully installed and run Emacs 19.31 (there was an
initial stumbling block: the Emacs bat file cannot be invoked directly
because it does not properly allocate the initial environment memory.  The
Emacs notes supplied a helpful workaround of making a shortcut icon and
updating its memory properties.  So, fine, that works).  Not one to be
patient, I immediately attempted to use Emacs as the alternate editor for
Pine message composition.  The closest I can get to interoperability of
Pine with Emacs is to invoke the shortcut file
(\windows\desktop\emacs.pif).  This almost works: at least Emacs runs, and
it gets the text of the message thus far composed in Pico.  Alas, shortly
thereafter (10-30 seconds), Pine decides that the Emacs session is
finished, whether or not I have concluded my message edits and exited
Emacs.  I have fiddled with all the properties of the Emacs shortcut icon
and cannot solve this problem.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

What did you set "user-domain=" to in your pine.conf file??

Subject: decoding urlencoded text and mailcap
Date: Tue, 2 Jul 1996 11:47:40 -0700

Recently my curiousity was piqued by a posting about setting up an
application to decode urlencoded text.  I have written a simple urldecoder
that takes the stdin and spits out decoded text.  It works great when I
pipe to it in pine.  What I was hoping is that I could setup a mailcap
entry that would tell pine to pipe through urldecode automatically when it
sees a certain mime type.  I tried

	application/x-www-form-urlencode; urldecode

but it didn't work.  Also tried cat %s | urldecode.  I'm really guessing
here; there is so little documentation that says "this means that", it's
mostly examples.

Anyway, any ideas on how I could get this to work?  Thanks.

You can also try 

	zcat < filename.Z> | tar -xvf -

if you don't have the gnu utilities.

Run pine again, it will create a new one with defaults.

Hi Pine People,

Since this is a Cc: of my bug report, I'm assuming you can pull up any 
of the necessary information on my local configuration from the
attachements above.

ObInfo: Sun Sparc 2, SunOS 4.1.4, Pine 3.94, gcc 2.7.2, sendmail 8.6.11
(if I recall correctly on the sendmail version).

The problem is that when I forward messages, extra characters are added to
the message, _after_ the filter (if any) and _after_ the message is saved
to the sent-mail folder.

When I forward the attached message, as an example (with or without a
filter), extra periods seem to show up randomly in the body of the
message.

Please tell me if you are able to reproduce this error or need more
information (or perhaps I'm simply going crazy).  Thanks.

An initial charge of $100.00 USD will be made to register the Domain name.
This charge covers any updates required during the first two (2) years.
The Billing Contact listed in Section 6 will be invoiced within ten (10)
days of Domain name registration.  For detailed information on billing,

The party requesting registration of this name certifies that, to her/his
knowledge, the use of this name does not violate trademark or other statutes.

Registering a Domain name does not confer any legal rights to that name and
any disputes between parties over the rights to use a particular name are to
be settled between the contending parties using normal legal methods.  See
RFC 1591 available at:

   ftp://rs.internic.net/policy/rfc1591.txt

By applying for the Domain name and through the use or continued use of the
Domain name, the applicant agrees to be bound by the terms of NSI's then
current Domain name policy (the 'Policy Statement') which is available at:

   ftp://rs.internic.net/policy/internic/internic-domain-4.txt

(If this application is made through an agent, such as an Internet Service
Provider, that agent accepts the responsibility to notify the applicant of
the conditions on the registration of the Domain name and to provide the
applicant a copy of the current version of the Policy Statement, if so
requested by the applicant.)  The applicant acknowledges and agrees that
NSI may change the terms and conditions of the Policy Statement from time
to time as provided in the Policy Statement.

The applicant agrees that if the use of the Domain name is challenged by any
third party, or if any dispute arises under this Registration Agreement, as
amended, the applicant will abide by the procedures specified in the Policy
Statement.

This Registration Agreement shall be governed in all respects by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and
of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of law rules.
This Registration Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement of the
applicant and NSI ("parties") regarding Domain names.  It supersedes, and
its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications
between the parties.  This Registration Agreement may only be amended as
provided in the Policy Statement.

I want mkpgp to exploit all of the new filtering features of Pine.  That is,
I want it to have all of its present functionality when used as the various
filters.  To do so will require that the filtering mechanism be fully
interactive.

Can someone tell me how to make these filters interactive?

Thanks.

    I am not absolutely certain on this due to changes that may have
been made in the recent new versions of Pine, but I think that when you
filter incoming mail into various folders, you get a notification only
if you just so happen to have a particular folder open at the time a 
new message is placed into it.

    One thing I have that I make freely available may help some.  I
have a Un*x shell script which in turn calls a Perl script to sniff in
all of the incoming mail folders I have defined and display a count of
how many messages are in each one by name.  In Un*x Pine (unless it has
been turned off) you can just Ctrl-Z to suspend Pine, run the script to
check your mail folders, and then 'fg' to re-enter Pine.

    You can get the scripts by browsing my WWW home page.

It is the Eudora user's fault.  He/she must have configured Eudora
improperly.  When I attach a text file, in Eudora 1.5.x, the text is 
not encoded, and I had no trouble reading it in Pine as attachment.

A likely cause of Eudora's misbehavior may be the filename extention.
I normally name my text files xxx.txt.  If you name it xxx.doc, it is 
very likely for Eudora to do the wrong things.

Subject: How to prevent: Session now Read-Only
Date: 28 Jun 96 11:17:09 GMT
Message-Id: <netrom.835960629@find2.dbc.bib.dk>

Is it possible to disable the steal-folder feature, which happens
when one (by accident?) are running two pine-sessions.

My problem is that the second pine-session forces the
first pine-session to enter read-only mode, and thereby
cancels all modifications done to that folder.

I would preferer that the second pine-session were started
in read-only mode instead of stealing the folder from the first.

Have I overlooked a 'feature'-variable which controls that feature?

Does anyone have a hack which prevents the theft? (Or can someone
point me to the files which controls it)

One way would be to include the "-o" option on the command line you use to
start Pine.  This forces the first-opened folder (usually the IBOX unless
you specify a different folder using the -f option) to be opened
read-only.

There is no specific feature to say "if I'm the second concurrent IMAP
client session then don't grab write-control".  Indeed I'm not sure it
would even be possible to do so with the IMAP spec: I know it is possible
to open a folder read-only, and to open a folder read-write (grabbing the
lock of any other IMAP session for that folder), but I don't recall a
"test if anyone else has this folder write-locked" command.

Cheers,

Attention!

	Do any of you know where I can find an inexpensive e-mail provider
that does NOT provide access to the internet. The provider needs to be
located in the Seattle area(206 area code).

Thanks,

I'm using 3.91 and I was wondering if there's a way I can configure Pine 
so that when I log in and open my folder lidt, it will only show me 
newsgroups that have new posts in them... when I used to use whatever it 
was I was using (I think it's just regular old Kermit/UseNet) I had typed

NEWS> set/directory=new

For now, I'm opening the first newsgroup and TABbing to the next new 
message, which means after I read my newsgroups, I have to Delete and 
eXclude them, which is annoying if I want to go back to an old post... 
email me or post, because I just figured out my server *does* have this 
group (I posted like 10 minuted before this via the WWW, and I'm not sure 
if it got here or not)

TIA!!

Hi!

I thought I remember reading something on IMAP that implied the
functionality Morten is seeking.  Is there something with IMAP4 maybe that
handles multiple simultaneous client sessions without running into lock
contention?  Maybe the imapd process handling the locking on behalf of the
clients?  This would be _very_ useful.  One of my biggest problems with
remote access is a user stealing a lock from another session and coming in
the next day and not being able to reclaim the lock on the original
session. 

Thanks

I've set up filtering to move messages from various listservs to certain 
folders. This all seems to work well but now my INBOX is messed up. I've
got it to work by pointing my inbox to ~/EMERGENCY_MBOX but this is obviously
not correct. What should my inbox be? default and /usr/spool/mail don't
work.

Thanks

Dave

OK.... but just be warned that the general idea of Pine's normal behaviour
is that if you leave a session in Pine and later start it again elsewhere
(another office, dialling in from home, etc) it presenets you with a
usable (read/write) session rather than being locked into a read-only
session.

As such your changes aren't really ideal in a general environment (but
presumably are to you with your particular needs).

Cheers,

Richard,
The locking behavior is a function of the mailbox format.
If you configure your system to use the so-called "Tenex"
format, you can have multiple sessions that can update flags
and see new mail.  The one thing you can't do is Expunge when there is
more than one session.

An experimental mailbox format is under development that may allow for
simultaneous expunges as well.  Also, I believe CMU's Cyrus IMAP server
already permits concurrent sessions with full access.

Try piping the message to this script (uuread):

#!/bin/csh -f
cd ~ ; sed "s/begin\ [1-7][1-7][1-7]/begin\ 600/g" > UU.tmp
set fileName = `grep ^begin\ 600 < UU.tmp | awk '{print $3}'`
uudecode UU.tmp ; rm UU.tmp ; cat $fileName ; rm $fileName

It will write and delete two tmp files in your home directory (UU.tmp and
encoded file name).

This has nothing to do with IMAP.  IMAP is just as limited by the
restrictions of the mail store as local access is limited by those
restrictions.  What is special about IMAP is that, unlike POP, it does not
impose any additional restrictions of its own.

The problem (did you read my other message about this?) is that the
standard Unix mail format can not be handled by multiple simultaneous
read/write agents in any sort of reasonable fashion.  Simultaneous update
involves some kind of update mode access, either a format that is
ameniable to update mode (O_RDWR on UNIX) or a format which stores
messages in separate files.

The fix, therefore, is to use some other format of mail than the UNIX
standard.  This is Cyrus' "secret" to accomplishing this.  This is also
how you accomplish it in c-client.

If you use Pine, please refer to the Pine technical notes about "tenex
format" and how to convert to using it.  This is the simplest of about
half a dozen different alternative format options in existance, and it
works with all versions of the software.  [There are better choices today,
but they only work with the latest imap-4 toolkit versions.]

This is an undocumented FAQ.  If you can read articles 3 weeks back,
you probably would not ask this question.  Any way, I have a web page
for setting up (Unix) Pine and PGP to do the chores (encrypt/decrypt/
clear-sign) on the flight:

	http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html

I am not sure how to do PC-Pine with PGP.  Sorry!

Hi,
I wrote a converter for this kind of job. You can call it a "fast hack",
it's ignoring most of the Comments given in the pine-addressbook.
But anything else works fine (groups too).

I use the elm filter feature with pine to filter incomming e-mail into 
several different folders.  

My problem is that I cannot tell when I have new mail because it is 
automatically moved from my INBOX to the folders I have specified.

Is there a way for me to have pine indicate that new mail has been 
delivered and in to what folder it was placed??

I was getting this from time to time.  Something having to do with the 
postponed box.  Look in your home directory for the file 
.pine-interrupted-mail, and delete it (mine was zero bytes, and obviously 
was confusing pine).

Hm.. well, I'm not sure about that one. Maybe it depends on what editor you
use? If you use an external editor or the internal pico-like. I use vi, and
the cursor is positioned at the start of the body of the message. Personally,
I think that's fine, since I start answering a mail at the top, I don't 
know about you though :)

Message-Id: <4r3s01$pkb@shellx.best.com>


When I print out a message in Pine on my Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4 Plus,
the on-line and one other light go on, and I then have to walk over to the
printer, turn off the on-line light, push the other lit one, and then turn
the on-line light back on, to get the message to print out.

Is there any way of programming Pine to send a page-eject or whatever
other kind of message that would save me this little (but oft-repeated!)
trip??

Many thanks,

Joe Luttrell

There is not really such a thing as a "Pine mailbox" ... Pine merely
access mail stored on the mail server in one of a number of common folder
formats.  The most commonly encountered is "Berkeley" format, as used by
most UNIX systems.

Pine can be configured to use direct access to the mailbox file, although
it is better for a number of reasons to instead configure it to use the
IMAP protocol to connect to an IMAP server.  (IMAP is a protocol designed
to allow remote mail clients such as Pine, Simeon, etc, to access mail on
the mail server.)

Netscape Navigator can use either direct file access or the POP protocol
to connect to a POP server.  (POP is a mail access protocol along the
lines of IMAP but with different/less functionality.)

So....

If you have direct access to your mailbox you MAY be able to use Navigator
to access your mail folder.

If you only have access to mail through an IMAP sverver you can't
(Navigator doesn't support IMAP).

If you have access to a POP server then you again can use Navigator.

I suggest you contact your local help deak/ISP to learn what options are
open to you and for assistance in using them.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Using aixterm with a large (>100 columns or so) window,

"resize" doesn't help.

Is there a known size limitation?

(If it helps, I can narrow down the definition of "large"
 a bit better, by trial and error).

p.s. this is the first problemette I've seen in about 2-3 weeks

    Sad to say, your prospects are none too good.  When you say you
went to check for new mail, you did not say you were doing anything to
filter mail into separate incoming mail folders, so I will presume
the mail you were checking for was to have been in the default inbox,
whatever it is named on your system.  Although Pine uses this inbox, in
a manner of speaking it does not "own" it.  Probably some other process
messed up and wiped it out.  About all you can do is ask your site's
Help Desk or system administrator if regular backups are made of the
mail spool, and if so, could they restore whatever they can. 
Unfortuantely, I wouldn't be optimistic.  Sorry.

    Just as a suggestion for future consideration, I personally do not
think is it a good idea to leave already read mail in the inbox for
this very reason.  I always move important messages into some Pine
folder or other, which is part of my regular storage and a little less
likely to get hit by accidents like those to the mail spool.  (Others
may differ.)

    Did you uuencode the file you wanted to send OUTSIDE of Pine and
then include it in the body of your message with ^R ?  That is the
usual technique.  You need to be able to see the actual uuencoded file
in the message before you send it.  Or are you possibly sending an
attachment, which is something else?

    That should not make any difference, because uuencode is
deliberately a 7-bit code.

I'm using pine on Linux, and on various occasions I notice, that my
newsposting are still using MIME-QuotedUnReadable, when I have enabled
8bit-news-posting. Pine 3.94. :?

Sure. I created a uuencoded file which i included with vi (:r file.uu),
which is my alternate editor. I can see the file before i send
it and it's a valid uuencoded file. Btw. i am using pine 3.94 on
HP-UX 10.10.

    I will go out on an etiquette limb and repost this, as I have not
so far received any replies either in the newsgroup or by email.  Sven
Guckes originally posted the one-line Perl script to convert =xx type
quoted-printable characters, but unfortunately all I get is a locked-up
session.  Because I do receive mail with untranslated QP characters in
them, a working translator would be very welcome.

    Thanks very much.

    Someone emailed me that "perl" above really refers to Perl 5.  On
my system, if I want Perl 5 I have to say "perl5" because Perl 4 is
still alive and well.

    However, even after making the change, Pine still locked up on me. 
The display would ripple (possibly due to a screen refresh) and "PIPED
MESSAGE" would appear in the message bar at the top of the screen. 
(BTW, I am using Pine 3.94 and dialing in with a PC emulating a
vt100.)  Things would more or less be locked up tight.  I could Ctrl-Z
back to a shell prompt and kill the Pine process, but that is about
all.  The only other command Pine would respond to is '?' to get the
prompts at the bottom of the screen (since I run with the prompts off
since version 3.93), and even then, none of the prompts would work.

    I wonder if there is some sort of problem with the latchup between
Perl and Pine in my configuration (SunOS 4.1.4).  Any suggestions
gratefully received, because it is truly annoying to try to read
messages with QP characters in them untranslated.

Whenever I mail a new message, the time zone in the Date: field is set to
PDT (Pacific Daylight-savings Time?) instead of CEST (Central European
Summer Time). Under Windows for Workgroups 3.11, I cannot find where to
set the local time zone, so PC-Pine probably defaults to the Washington
local time. Is there a PC-Pine Config option available to set the time
zone, or anything I didn't find in the Windows control panel?

I am posting this once more hoping to get a reply this time...

Where do I place a global pinerc file for PC Pine (for Win-16), and how do
I call it, on a PC that is used by several persons for e-mail?

Not really sure that it'll help you, but I set up my pine
printer configuration as

         sed '1!s/^Date: /?Date: /' | lp

as the personally selected print command. The '?' sign in this expression
stands for the ASCII form-feed symbol (octal 014).

This works perfectly when I apply "prYnt" command to several messages
on my HP-UX work station. Every message goes out on a separate page,
if you don't print them within full-header mode.

You will probably check your printer setup, too.

I get this error occasionally, too.  I'm beginning to suspect it's a
"sharing" problem, i.e., my popclient is appending new incoming mail to
my inbox at the same time Pine is trying to read from it.

Not sure what the solution is, though.  I'd certainly be interested to
hear any suggestions.

Hi,
my new problem with pine is that i can't send

that's it...
I have an ESMPT server so i enabled 8bit ESMPT negotiation
if that means something.

Any clues ?

Yup, that feature accidentally got broken in 3.94... it'll be fixed in

Hello? Anybody there?

I have a question: how can I send an e-mial note to all the members of my 
address book at once?

I can't figure out the commands myself.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks...

I use Pine successfully with Wyse terminals, but not without a few config 
options.  To my makefile I added "-DTERMCAP_WINS" which fixes the arrow
keys.  You must do this for pine's makefile as well as pico's makefile. 
I also added "preserve-start-stop-characters" to the feature list
in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed to fix the XON/XOFF problems with my 
serial terminal connections.  Also, if you are trying to compile Pine on
DC.OSx make sure you have cc version 4.0, or you're in for SEGV city. 

FWIW,

Hi Bryon--I just got pine and procmail working together also, but I've
got sendmail as the mail agent and procmail configured in my home 
directory.  Procmail's happily sorting mail into various incoming
folders.

Now, pine 3.94's release notes say it's possible to read mail sent
to other users' mail boxes.  I'm thinking of a "user" I create to
use as an account from which to subscribe to a mailing list;
alternatively the mail to this user might be sorted by procmail 
into an incoming folder in my home directory.  I haven't been able
to get procmail to do this, the mail still goes to the user to whom
it was directed in spite of a .forward file and a .procmailrc file
in that user's home directory.

Any suggestions?

Annelise

	I hope this isn't an obvious and stupid question. How
	can I get pico to stop leaving the pico.xxxx~ files
	in /tmp? I've looked through the man pages, I've looked
	through the documentation. I even tried hardcoding it
	into the source files when I rebuilt 3.94, but I must
	have missed a spot. I don't even use pico, as I've
	set it to use an alternate editor and have the option
	to use it implicitly set. Unfortunately, it still 
	starts with pico until I get past the headers. I run
	Linux, kernel 2.0, gcc 2.7.2. I find it really hard
	to believe that there is no provision to set a tmp
	file by way of the environment. If this is the case,
	then pine/pico is really brain-damaged.
	
	As an aside, the build proceedure is ridiculous. Life
	would be a lot simpler if the MS stuff was contained
	in separate directories. Getting the makefile and
	os-lnx.h info from ttyout.c (I believe that's the one
	with the comments about switching from the unix world
	to the dos/win world) was a real pain.
	


Thanks in Advance.

Edit the sendmail.cf file and change 0di to 0dq.  This will queue

I have sent mails to this list quite a few times claiming that neither the
newsposting nor the mailposting works for 8 bits!
I have made tests many times with pine 3.94 on Solaris 2.4 and the
results in all of them where negative! This feature has never worked
correctly for 3.93, 3.92 versions either.

Please pine-team, keep this serious bug (at least for us the foreigners!)
in mind when preparing for 3.95.

Thank you,

Howzit. Happy 4th of July! I just found out that there's a way that I can
access my email while in the Netscape browser mode. I checked in the
"options" to try and set up this process but a at a loss for what to put
in at the lines asking for: "Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server", "Incoming Mail
(POP) Server" and for "POP User Name", I had put in
"pine-robot@docserver.cac.washinton.edu for the first two and didnt know
what to put in the 3rd space. Needsess to say it didn't work, so I had to
exit to EWANTelnet to do this letter. Is this thing I heard possible, and
if so, can you help me with the proper 'incantation'? Thanks from the Big
Island, Hawaii. Jamil K. Samimi- jamil@aloha.net

Subject: Using old MH folders?
Date: 5 Jul 1996 13:16:43 +0200
Message-Id: <4ritir$299@Germany.EU.net>



Guten Tag!

After using exmh for quite a long time I decided to use another mail
reader because exmh tends to being slow when processing big amounts
of mail. (exmh is using the mh folder format.)

Is there any way to use the exmh folders from pine? Not just with
Goto folder and giving #mh/some_folder but with properly adding them
to the folder list? I tried the following:

o Used Add in Folder List and gave #mh/some_folder where some_folder
  is the name of an existing exmh folder. Unfortunately, pine just
  complains that this folder already exists.

o Used the old exmh mail directory as actual folder collection.
  The folder list displays all my old folders. Unfortunately, I cannot
  select any folder, probably because of pine not knowing that these
  are mh folders and not plain mail files as expected by pine.

Any suggestion? Thank you in advance for your help!

	If you are "lucky" you'd have access to a machine running
Solaris.  Solaris has a utility called "mp" which will do what you'd
like.  MP is also known as "make pretty".  I've seen the source
available quite some time ago on the Net.  You may be able to
find it....

	Good luck

I did this once, but I can't remember how.  I want to
configure pine 3.94 to display stars in the upper left
corner when its busy doing stuff.  I can't find the option
to turn this on.  I'm using the precompiled linux binaries.

Any help would be appreciated.

         FEATURE: enable-mail-check-cue

If set, this feature will cause an asterisk to appear in the upper
left-hand corner of the screen whenever Pine checks for new mail, and two
asterisks whenever Pine saves (checkpoints) the state of the current
mailbox to disk.

I recently ftp'd the Solaris binary of 3.94 and installed
it, replacing 3.91 that we used successfully for a long
time.

Users report that pine tries to create a folders directory
named
	/home/fac/joe//home/fac/joe/mail

(or perhaps it was Mail) and fails.

Is that because of the way 3.94 was compiled?

Thanks,
Pete

Recompile pine with `ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM' defined in os.h and add

Greetings: I have installed the pop3d from the imap 4 version. This did 
solve my Netscape probblem but I have users now saying when they use 
other pop clients like 'eudora', sorry, these users are Eudora fans, that 
ALL their mail on my pop server gets downloaded to their pc and deleted 
from the pop server eventhough their .ini file on their pc says to leave 
the mail on the server.

  Can anyone explain why this might be happening? It seems I have solved 
one problem (Netscape) but created a new problem.


Thanks

Jim

   I like to know where I get compiled pine for aix 4.1 running on a rs6000

 
				Felipe (nogueira@dsc.ufpb.br)


------------
I'd try the AIX Public Domain Software Library (aixpdslib) at UCLA.  You can 
http or ftp there at
	http://aixpdslib.seas.ucla.edu

They've got a wide variety of software; available as source or also 
pre-compiled binary.

( But if you get it pre-compiled, you miss all the real fun! )  

The instructions for compiling the source (at least for 3.2.5) is quite clear, 
and even for this novice, quite easy.

Go for it!

Someone suggested that I grab the source code compile it. I have:
	(1)Solaris 2.5, and 
	(2) gcc. 

So all I have to do is:
	(1) gunzip pine*gz
	(2) tar -xvf pine*
	(3) cd pine3.94
	(4) ./build sol
right?

Wrong. There's one heckuva lot of hand editing that has to be done and
nary a clue of how to do it.

For example, even if I edit makefile.sol for both pine and pico so that
CC=gcc, I still have to change the CFLAGS so that SYSTYPE is defined
correctly, right? And even after I did that, I still get more error
messages.

Does anyone have a good set of gcc-oriented makefiles and
Solaris-dependent files that I could use?

Thanks,
Pete

PS: I apologize if I have been stupid and overlooked something obvious --
except that it wasn't obvious to me.

Is there a  command that can copy all the messages in a collection to a 
folder in another collection (then delete all folders in the collection)? 
Do I have to select all the messages, apply and save, goto the next
folder, select all the messages again, etc. ?

Hi,

I am currently using Pine 3.92 for PC and Unix, and have found that when
I attempt to access more than one IMAP account I find that the second
one always asks me for my id/password again, even though I have
specified it before; this doesn't occur for the first IMAP account.

I have a number of accounts on different systems, with different ids 
and passwords.

Does this occur in Pine 3.94 as well, or will be 'fixed' in the 
upcoming  3.95?

Thanks,
Chuck

Okay, it's probably been mentioned by now, but just in case it hasn't...

Whenever a message operation (read, bounce, forward, reply, etc.) is done
immediately after a bounce on some platforms (NetBSD, FreeBSD, and UnixWare
all exhibit this behavior), Pine crashes with various signal errors.  On
NetBSD and FreeBSD, it's often an IOT trap, and on UnixWare, it's always an
abort trap.  (Why is Pine getting SIGABRT anyway!?  Only abort() should
raise it...) 

I can supply truckloads of pine-debug and pine-crash files if necessary;
this error I can reproduce time after time.

Nothing to do with Pine. Create a file called .forward in your home
directory, containing the email address to forward to.

Hi there, since upgrading our system to Linux 2.0.0, I have been recieving
the following error:

[New mailbox modification time but apparently no changes]

I am running pine 3.93.  This error doesn't happen every time.  Only every
so often.  Has anyone else had this happen?  What causes this?  Should I
be worried?  Any help would be greatly apprecitated.

PS. Please e-mail responces, I don't always get a chance to read news

    Sorry (for a lot of us), but Pine does not implement killfiles. 
For incoming mail, you can use some other program which processes the
mail before Pine opens it.  On Unix systems, procmail and filter are
two often used programs.  For newsgroups, we're just out of luck, as
far as I know.

I have been trying to attach a gif file to my message.  The recipient 
receives a MIME encoded file that he can successfully unpack,
however the resulting "gif" file cannot be read by a gif display program.
The error message says that the file is not a proper gif.  Comparing
the received file with the original shows that they are different
sizes, too.  What's going on?

    I have run into a problem I have never encountered before.  Any
suggestions from superior wisdom and experience will be welcome.

System: Pine 3.94 under SunOS 4.1.4 (a flavor of Un*x)
Config file character-set value: ISO-8859-1

    A bit ago I sent an email with a message body to several recipients
and also specified an attachment in the email header.  Everything
looked fine.  The attachment was actually plain text with ISO-8859-1
(8-bit European) letters in it.  I wanted to send the second file along
as an attachment partly because of the 8-bit letters and partly to keep
it separate from the main message.

    After I sent the email, I decided to look at the Fcc, because I
have rarely had occasion to use attachments.  The only problem is that
I cannot view the attachment.

    If I exit Pine and actually look at the whole mail folder with a
text editor, the attachment is there, MIME header and all, in BASE64
format.  Back in Pine, from the attachment index screen I can
successfully save the attachment as a external file and look at it with
an independent text editor, and everything is fine: the file gets
converted out of BASE64 into real text, and even the 8-bit letter are
intact.  The 'A' command from the attachment index screen tells me
things about the attachment.  For example, it tells me that the
attachment is Text/PLAIN, and the Display Method is "shownonascii
iso-8859-1 <datafile>".

    However, if I issue the 'V' command actually to view the attachment
from within Pine, nothing happens.  The "Displaying attachment" message
breifly flashes at the bottom of the screen, followed by the message
"VIEWER command launched."  But nothing happens.  No view.  Just back to
where I was.

    Anybody else run into something like this and have a solution?  Am
I missing something in my config, perhaps?

Thanks very much.

Thank you at Kristian for your fast reply.
It works fine except of one little feature: the position of the cursor.
The pine help says that the cursor will be positioned after the
included text, as I would like it.
But it is positioned at the beginning of the included text.

What's wrong?

Thanks again for your help,
Ulrike

Moin!

I'd like to use "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" without a
positive 8bit-esmtp-negotiation response.

And without patching pine.


Is there a way?

How do I protect myself against mailbombs. Its seems I've become the 
target of one of the many ignorant morons who feel power in annoying others.

I have heard mention of an automatic killfile ?? And how do i look at the 
header of the mailbomb without triggering the ansi sequence. If I can 
find out who this person is I will be emialing his sysadmin.

I'm using pine as my primary mail reader.

Thanks

FYI, some mailing list and news group archives are accessible via
IMAP.  If you're using pine you can add the following to your
folder-collections to check out a some IMAP archives: 

 {cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/anonymous}[]
 *{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/[]

The first one includes the IMAP and ACAP mailing list archives. 
The second one has archives of the net-happenings mailing list. 

If you know of any other IMAP accessible archives, please let me
know.  I'd like to collect a list and put it on the Web. 

Thanks,
Nancy

	Try upgrading to ping 3.94.  I had a similar problem on a
different platform.  It disappeared when going from 3.92 to 3.94.

I didn't think of that.  That would work too.

This didn't work, but I may have had permissions wrong.

It's installed on the system--both (all) users have access.  What
I did, Jeremy, was create an rmail group and put myself--andrsn, the
"reading" user--in it, and make the user's mail files that I want to
read group-owned by rmail and and group readable.  This second user
can then have whatever filtering in .procmailrc is appropriate, and
I can set up pine in-boxes (in my own account) to read this mail.

That's basically what I do, but I can think of many situations where
a human user might want to read the mail sent to a variety of accounts--
e.g., sales@company.com, help@company.com, webmaster@company.com.  Or
perhaps many human users should be able to read these incoming messages.

I set up a "maildrop" account for a user unable to log in (* in 
password field) --found out user needs a valid shell to get mail.

It turned out to be an interesting exercise in ownership and permissions!

Thanks for your help--

You can shut off autowrap using the -w flag, e.g.:

  pico -w filename

On the subject of a "Winsock Notepad" there might be something cool
you can do with WinPine and WinPico to edit files that reside on
a remote server.  You can do it with email messages that are being
accessed with IMAP so it seems like you should be able to do it
with any ascii file (not necessarily an email message).  Maybe we
need to wait for ACAP to do this type of thing.  Does anyone know
any tricks for doing it now?

Hi Paul.

Maybe you are running into a similar type of problem as I am experiencing. 

I am trying to help someone out in getting Pine to understand a new MIME
type, and created a ~/.mailcap file with an appropriate entry. When I
tried to view the attachment with the newly installed viewer, I also saw
the "VIEWER command launched" message being displayed without anything
else happening. Assuming you also have a mailcap file installed, your
problem could very well be identical.

If you try long enough you can sometimes view the attachment, but the
chances of this happening are slim. Also, if you press View in rapid
succession, Pine locks up (did you also noticed this?)  When Pine is
locked up like that, a check of the running processes sometimes reveals a
number of spawned viewers running in the background (all with PPID 1).
They never stay around for long, though.

When I added the option "needsterminal" for the given attachment in
~/.mailcap, the attachments would always be displayed properly. By the
very definition of that option, the attachment is then being displayed
outside Pine's standard scrolling text window (do-it-yourself).

Perhaps there is a problem with Pine's code that handles the bidirectional
pipe to the viewer running in the background. You could try the option
needsterminal just mentioned, or uncomment the iso-8859-1 entries from the
mailcap file(s) all together. 

I'm trying to figure out what exactly is going wrong, but I'm a little
short on time right now. Just thought the current info might be useful to
you. 

Kind regards,

- Richard Gering.

You should take a look at trn, rn, nn, slrn, strn.  All have an excellent,
very flexible killfile facility.

Pine is great for mail, but I don't care for it as a newsreader.  There
are much better tools available for that purpose.

BTW, I use trn myself, and make extensive use of the killfile.  You can
select patterns in *any* field in an article's header, making it easy to
kill crossposts, and even *references* to people you don't like.

trn also has the advantage over Pine in that it does true article
threading, making it easy to follow the flow of a discussion.

Try it!  You'll like it!

I think you've misunderstood what PINE is.  When the user executes it, 
it retrieves mail from a mail server, and displays that mail to the user,
and allows the user to save it into folders, forward it, reply to it etc. 
When the user is not executing it, it's incapable of doing anything. 

>  For instance,

But nobody does send mail to PINE.  They address mail to a user at a mail
domain, and the mail transfer agents pass it to a destination mail server.
Then a user executes a mail client application such as PINE, and PINE
retrieves mail from the mail server, and presents it to the user. 

Why would you suppose the people went to the trouble of writing
listservers or majordomo, if PINE could do this? 

If you want to forward mail in your absence (vacation facility) or have
mail to a given address exploded into a distribution list, then you'd want
to use a facility associated with the mail server, that is active all the
time.  PINE (the client program that you execute intermittently) plays no 
part in that. 

> If this cannot work, does anyone have any other suggestions?  

As far as I can see, we don't know enough about your circumstances to be
able to give specific advice.  Contact the user support or sysadmin of the
mail server that you use. 

Note that managing a mailing list is a nontrivial activity.  It's
far too easy for simple-minded mail exploders to field non-delivery
reports and redistribute those to the list, provoking further
non-delivery reports and redistributing those, leading to server
meltdown and considerable user frustration.  Don't try the d-i-y
approach.

This is usenet.  If you're sufficiently interested in the answer
you'll read the group.  If you aren't sufficiently interested, there
may be other readers who'd like to know the answer anyway.  On the
usenet group news.announce.newusers you will find some helpful notes
on how to work together with the usenet community, you'll get better
results that way.  Good luck.

I don't want the list to be public.

Is there a way to ensure that the only address the recipient will be able 
to see is the recipient's?

I am currently using HyperTerminal on Windows 95 for email transmission
into the
I hope this prints out what just happened after the into____

This is the type of bugs that keep occuring in the system.  I do not
know if it is me of the freenet.

Right now I am having to do hard returns instead of letting the
system wrap around since it started just now the jiberish of the
current second line of the message after trying to wrap itself around.

Another problem I am having is that my nicknames are not functioning.
I have only three at this time, but when I put the nicknames in and
then composed and sent two emails, the system put the messages into a
folder o
of mail sent to me.  So I had to go in and say forward these two
emails and type in the entire address for both emails before I could
get it to send.

Help!!

This could change in the near future. Somewhere on the Netscape WWW
server I saw a message saying Navigator will support IMAP at Q3 release.
This would definitely be a cool thing...

I believe it's "esc-esc" then ^.  I know it begins with "esc-esc".

    Make sure your version of Pine is current (3.94).  Use the Lcc:
feature in the mail headers.  (There are online help screens, as with
most of Pine's features.)

	I was wondering how you do several different things in Pine 3.91 & 3.92

	First, how do you redirect mail that was sent to you by accident?  What is 
the command?

	Second, what is the file or command to set up a auto-reply to incomming 
message?

	Third, how do you set up a kill file so that pine auto deletes any messages 
from a particular person or newsgroup?

	Oh, forgot one thing...

	How do you get pine to display the recipients name in the TO: line instead of 
TO: Undisclosed recipients     when you mail to a mailing list and use the BCC 
line to hide the rest of the address'  I want it to look like this when the 
person recieved it:

TO           : John Doe <johnd@network.com>
FROM     : Pagemaster <laker@netcom.com>
SUBJECT: Club posting

	Right now all I get is something that looks like this:

TO        : Undisclosed recipients
FROM   : Pagemaster <laker@netcom.com>
SUBJECT: Club posting

	Is there a way to change this?

I am having trouble locating my disk file that I want to ATTACH.
When in the Composer, and I pressed Ctrl-J to specify the <filename>
Pine can't find the file. It says no such file.

I am using Windows 95. What did I do wrong?

Please advise. Thanks.

AL

P.S. I am getting 2 extra linefeeds between paragraphs, putting a big
     gap between paras. How do I prevent it from doing this?

To whom it may concern:
	I have this problem with my account.  I have not been in my
account for a couple weeks and when I checked my mail I found that someone
has gotten into my account.  No one has my password.  Someone has erased
most of my messages saved from May and June and erased some of my
addresses.  These things are very important to me and very hard to come
by.  I would appreciate any help to my dilemma.  Thank you for your time
and effort.

	There was no need to copy the pine group about your situation.
The group is for discussion of problems related specifically to the
pine user agent.

	With luck your postmaster will be able to help you.

What software are you using on your Mac when you access Pine?  If it's
NCSA Telnet, make sure you have the latest version (2.7b4).  Among other
things, 2.7b4 fixes both of the problems you described.
 
In the mean time, use "ESC ESC ^" instead of "Ctrl-^" to set a marker.

     I really like Pine.  But I would like to know why Pine is smart about
scrolling through message text (deletes one line at the top or bottom of
the text and fills in the line that opens up at the bottom or top), and at
the same time stupid about scrolling through the index (apparently
redrawing every line).  Seems to me it's done this since at least 3.91.

Then you press B in the INDEX, on top of the message you wish to bounce.

Not exactly a pine matter, but vacation could be a good start..
"man vacation" .

Pine doesn't support killfiles (atleast according to my info).

The sysadmin upgraded to a newer version of pine, 
Now when i wan't to run something in the background
my cursor on my home machine dissapears and so does the text after that
even when i try to type something.

The text is echoing, Becuase when i look at the scrollback i can see 
the commands and text that i type.

I have a shell account wich i use from home.
I am also using Ncomm for a term program on my Amiga.

My theory is there are some control characters that are somehow
turning the cursor color to the background color.

This happens more often than not, And is getting very annoying.
My sysadmin blames my term program, As he connot duplicate the problem.

Any way that i can find out where this problem is coming from?
Is it from pine or settings in SOLARIS?

I have Pine E-Mail and when I try to get into it, it locks up on me. The top of the page at the main menu says (mail closed.) At the bottom it says (opening inbox) but nothing is happening. I was on it in January and February but had to leave the internet for a while. When I got back on last week I could not get into the mail or news group. I asked StarText but they don't understand what is happening either. Thanks for your help.

Yeah, I'd also like to know how to configure Pine to get to show me only 
new news items in the Folder List (if possible)... somebody please post

Forgive me for my ignorance but is it at all possible to
configure pine to act like a listserver?  For instance,
I am familiar with majordomo for macintosh.  Someone sends
mail to the listserver and then mail is distributed to everyone
on the list.  This is basically what I'm after.  I am using pine 
in the unix shell of my ISP.

If this cannot work, does anyone have any other suggestions?  

Please respond to me at rsnell@smart.net.  Thank you in advance.

Sincerely,
Robert Snell

Hiya

I'm using PINE to access an NNTP server on a different machine via
PPP.  It works quite well, except that I've got to manually get to
the newsgroups section (g,contol-p,name.of.newsgroup,enter).

I'd like to setup an 'initial keystrokes' list which will get me to
the first newsgroup automatically.

Anyone know how this can be done?

Subject: ISO to CP translation in Pine 394
Message-Id: <Pine.OS2.3.94.960708111002.37B-100000@quinag.csi.cam.ac.uk>

There seems to be a bug in the behaviour of the translation of
ISO-8859-1 to PC code pages.=20

The technical notes specify as follows:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D  =20
   In the case of PC-Pine, the character values cannot be passed through
   to the display device unaltered since MS-DOS uses various non-standard
   character sets called "Code Pages".
  =20
   The mapping between DOS Code Page and standard character set is
   controlled by the "character-set" variable in the PINERC file and the
   PC's installed Code Page. PC-Pine will automatically map common
   characters in IBM Code Pages 437, 850, 860, 863, and 865 to ISO-8859-1
   and back when the PINERC has "character-set=3DISO-8859-1". Pine will
   also map common characters for IBM Code Page 866 to ISO-8859-5 and
   back when "character-set=3DISO-8859-5". The mappings are bi-directional,
   and applied to all saved text attachments in the defined character
   set, messages exported, etc.
  =20
   Alternatively, the translation tables can be configured externally and
   applied at run time whenever the "character-set=3D" variable is set to
   something other then "US-ASCII" (the default). PC-Pine looks in the
   text file pointed to by the environment variable "ISO_TO_CP" for the
   table to use for mapping text matching the type defined by the
   "character-set=3D" variable into the local Code Page value. PC-Pine
   looks in the text file pointed to by the environment variable
   "CP_TO_ISO" for the table to use for mapping text in the local Code
   Page into outbound text tagged with the "character-set=3D" variable's
   value.
  =20
   A text file containing a character set mapping table is expected to
   contain 256 elements where each element is a decimal number separated
   from the next element by white-space (space, tab or newline, but no
   commas!). The index of the element is the character's value in the
   source character set, and the element's value is the corresponding
   character's value in the destination character set.=20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=20

I have sent myself a trial message contain a few pound signs. I have
tried displaying it in various versions of Pine (OS2 391 or 394, PC-WAT
391/394) with or without the ISO_TO_CP settings. I get the following
results, where "No ISOTOCP" means what it says, "X<->X" means an
ISOTOCP setting mapping all characters onto themselves, and "163->156"
means an ISOTOCP table which maps 163 onto 156, and all other chacaters=20
onto themselves. Note that 163 is pound in 8859-1 and 156 is pound in
CP850/CP437, whereas u-acute is 163 in CP850/CP437.
"163-65" maps 163 onto 65 and leaves all others alone (65 is A).

                    394 WAT     391 WAT      394 OS2     394 WIN
No ISOTOCP          ?            pound        u-acute    pound
X<->X               u-acute      u-acute      u-acute    pound
163->156            ?            pound        u-acute    ?
163->65             A            A            u-acute    A

To check that the SET variables influence the OS/2 port at all, I
experimented with the other direction (CP_TO_ISO). With an X<->X table,
pound is translated (bizarrely?) as ^blob (where by blob I mean a black
square); with a 156-163 table, pound becomes 163 (displayed as u-acute).
The details dont matter; the fact there is a change means that Pine is
noticing the CPTOISO table.

The following problems are evident:=20
a) The OS2 port is not honouring the promise to translate to the
codepage, and is not reading ISO_TO_CP
b) The WAT port isnot getting the ISO to CP right, and is outputting ?
for =A3 (I dont know where that ? comes from!)
c) I dont understand why forcing 163-> 156 causes a ? out of 394Win and
394WAT, but gets a pound from 391WAT.

(The W16 port of 394 gets the output of pound right, but Windows is
defined as using a mapping of 8859-1 (Windows code page 1252))

I have been pine for only a few days.
I want to know something.  How do I compose a mail offline?  I tried 
doing it by composing it in a text editor and then sending it as an 
attachment.  But my friend at the receiving end tells me that the 
attachment arrives as a jumble of ascii characters.

Is it possible to compose a message offline and then induct it into the 
message body once I get connected to the Internet?

Kindly help me out.

DILIP

	You do as you have done....except you don't send the output
of your text editor as an attachment but you read it into the body
by use of ^R (Control-R)

Yes. Use the ^R (CTRL and R pressed together) command to be prompted for
file name being imported into the message body -- move the cursor to a
required possition of text before this.

As other netters said, it depends on which terminal emulation software you
use.  

If you use Comet from the Cornell U., you simply hold down the control key
while typing the 6 key (no shift).  I use this same key combination on
hard-wired VT100 terminal, SGI terminal, and in Comet.  Comet is available
from info-mac and is a freeware.

The short answer is yes. Pine provides (via pine.conf.fixed) the ability
to forbid all the ways to escape to a shell (via, say, an alternate
editor). Of course, you have to do a lot more that just lock the doors
in the mailer, you also have to provide a restricted shell system.

Set up the news-approximates-new-status feature at your Main Setup
Config screen. Pine will set news status according to the contents
of the default .newsrc file (I mean Unix; if you use another environment,
the name of the file may vary :)

Here is the captured help screen about
        FEATURE: news-approximates-new-status
 
This feature causes certain messages to be marked as "New" in the
Folder Index of news groups.
 
When opening a news group, Pine will consult your "newsrc" file and
determine the last message you have previously disposed of via the "D"
key.  If this feature is set, any subsequent messages will be shown in the
Index with an "N", and the first of these messages will be highlighted.
Although this is only an approximation of true "New" or "unseen"
status, it provides a useful cue to distinguish more-or-less recent
messages from those you have seen previously, but are not yet ready to
mark deleted.
 
Background: your "newsrc" file (used to store message status information
for news groups) is only capable of storing a single flag, and Pine uses
this to record whether or not you are "done with" a message, as
indicated by marking the message as "Deleted".  Unfortunately, this
means that Pine has no way to record exactly which messages you have

Paul,
The symptoms you describe suggest that Pine has found an entry in your
system mailcap file for text/plain charset=8859-1, and is attempting to
invoke the program specified in the mailcap file, "shownonascii".  I'm
guessing that you are not using an X terminal at the moment, and since
"shownonascii" is an X-11 program, it might be having trouble talking to
your display. :)

In looking into this, Mike S. actually found a real bug in the testing of
mailcap entry parameters (which will be fixed in 3.95), but I think the
above explanation covers your situation. 

Your choices include: removing the text/plain mailcap entry, changing it
to invoke some other program, changing it to test for a DISPLAY variable
so it only invokes "shownonascii" if you are using X.

We have been using pine 3.94 for several weeks, and experience occasional
and unpredictable delays in sending messages, at times when system load on
our hpux system is quite light. After pressing ^X, the status line
displays something like "sending mail | 100%" for 70-90 seconds before
responding to key presses. I don't recall seeing these delays with 3.92. 

Suggestions?

Attached is a list of students (including returning lab assistants) who
have asked to have their accounts accessible over the summer. Unless
Doreen has received recent additions this list - given me on June 20 -

*** Actually it's 3.94 and it still has some problems (possibly not on

Thanks, Paul.

Unfortunately for us, we can't assume that our users have access to zmodem
on the receiving end, and they do want to do uploads as well as downloads. 
I'm also not sure we want to globally enable the pipe command.

We've been teaching people how to a) export to a text file, b) download, 
and c) delete the exported file.  It's frustrating for many new users, 
and this integrated upload-download feature seemed like it would make 
life simpler, if only we could get it to work.

I use a separate program to "POP3" my mail from our mail mailserver.
I had to download the POP3 program, called pop-perl5, which is a perl 
script.  You can find a copy at 

      ftp.warwick.ac.uk    pub/linux/sunsite.unc-mirror/system/Mail/
                             pop-perl5-1.1.tar.gz

As you can see, I am using Linux, but I believe the script should work 
for any operating system with a perl implementation.  

Good luck,
Ken Snyder.

I've got this in my autoexec.bat and PC-Pine for Windows seems
to use it:

  set TZ=EST5EDT

I don't know what's correct for CEST but maybe someone else
here does.

Good luck,

The restricted shell is what I have setup already (they simply get
pine as their login shell).

I've manage to shutdown everything hazardous by configuring it
in pine.conf.fixed, the only loopholes that still need to be
fixed are:

	Include attachment (I'd like to forbid that).
	Save attachment (I'd like to forbid that too, or make it
		impossible by specifying an impossible path).

What took some creative configuring to get right was the folder-collections,
but I set it to:

folder-collections     = mail/[]/.

Which effectively makes sure that mails cannot be saved anymore.

I can only find the v3.91 distribution at ftp.yggdrasil.com.
I heard that newer versions of Pine may no longer be free.
Is that why I can't find v3.92 and later?

	I see by your ID that you are using pine3.91.  Not sure when
it came to be, but with pine3.94 the (t)ake will search and display
candidates from the body of the message.

Continuing with the Solaris v. Pine saga...

I did a ./build gso and it was successful.

I then logged in as an ordinary user, and this is what
resulted when I tried to invoke the result of the build
(this, incidentally, is the same result as when I used the
posted Solaris binary):

I am trying to convert my VMS mail folders to unix mail folders to use 
with Pine.  I'm using the awk script that was posted to the pine 
discussion forum by Jim Clark on Jul 23 1995. Here is the script:

--------vmsmail.awk----------

        if (pagesep = 1 && newmsg = 0)  {pagesep = 0; print "" }
        next}

------ End Script ---------
The line which says:

//      { pagesep = 1; next }   # delay formfeeds

causes a syntax error when I run it using the command he suggested:

awk -f mail.awk oldmail.mai > oldmail

The syntax error is as follows:

awk: Syntax error near line 24
awk: bailing out near line 24

I'm not familar enough with awk to debug it myself although I did try 
removing the  '//' at the beginning of the line which causes it to say 
that there is an syntax error near line 26.
If I comment it out with '#' it runs but the file doesn't get converted. 
Anyone have any ideas or suggestions??

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Abe

Sometimes when I print my messages with the "Y" command, it works just 
fine, but sooner or later, the printing will stop and the computer 
freezes up - to the point where I have to quit the session just to get 
out and operating again. Sometimes it will print two or three messages 
and refuse the next, today I tried to print something lengthy and it got 
stuck 3 times in a row after the third page (but not every time in the 
same spot). 

Can somebody offer a hint as to what's going on? Memory problem maybe?
(But then why would it freeze up on a short message too?)

The normal T -command works here, 3.94. It seems to scan also the body of
the message for e-mail-addresses.. Excellent idea! :)

I certainly hope this is an entry in the FAQ - as a fairly new reader of this
newsgroup, I've already seen it lots of times.

'man forward' and 'man vacation' are two nice ways to get more information.
PINE is a mail reader/sender, no multi purpose mail tool for whatever we
can think of that has with mail to do.

Don't you want the auto-reply to work even when you don't run PINE?

> from a particular person or newsgroup?

Try 'filter' - a very easy little program for filtering incoming mails
and act according to the contents of the mails (like executing commands,
storing in different folders, etc).

'procmail' is another frequently used program (although a bit more
complicated).

For newsgroups, there's no solution atm.

  I guess that's because Pine doesn't get affirmative answer from STMP
server that it can speak ESMPT and support 8BITMIME. You may
as well have paid attention to the word "negotiation"  in 
'enable 8bit esmtp negotiation'. It's not 'enforce 8bit esmtp'
but 'enable ...negotiation'.  

Pine rather strictly follows ESMTP negotiation protocol specified in RFC
1651 and 1652 and falls back to QP/Base64 if SMTP server it talks to
doesn't follow RFC 1651/1652 although the SMTP server in question does
speak ESMTP. For instance, sendmail 8.7.5 is compliant to RFC 1651/1652
and Pine has no problem with sending 8BITMIME while sendmail 8.6.12
doesn't follow RFC 1651/1652 and Pine encodes outgoing message after
getting negative(or rather non-positive) answer from sendmail 8.6.12 
although sendmail 8.6.12 can speak ESMTP.

  Related question is what happens if MTA on sending site speaks ESMTP
and supports 8BITMIME while MTA on receiving site supports ESMTP but
doesn't comform to RFC 1651/1652.  On my Linux, sendmail 8.7.5 is
installed and Pine sends out 8BITMIME message as it can get positive
answer from sendmail 8.7.5. Now, ball is handed over to sendmail 8.7.5
and it seems like sendmail 8.7.5(client SMTP) on my Linux encodes
outgoing 8bit mesg. in QP/Base64 after failing to get positive answer
from receiving side MTA(server SMTP?). Reading RFC 1651/1652, I'm almost
sure this is what happens, but it would be nice to be assured of this.

   Thanks in advance,

Ok, your explanation is very good, however my tests were on systems
which definitely support esmtp negotiation (ESMTP Sendmail 8.7.4
is installed with EHLO being one of the commands it recognises).
I can very well recall when we were installing that and doing various
checks (mainly with Mail -v -- -v for verbose report on the
negotiation) that we could see the two machines talking in ESMTP.

Thus, I strongly believe that the problem is inside pine which
cannot understand that 8 bit posting is feasible!

Thank you,

 /usr/local/etc is one of standard directories($HOME,/etc, /usr/etc, and

whether or not Pine refer to mailcap in /usr/local/etc, though.  Anyway,
mailcap search path has nothing to do with your PATH variable. 'man

Hi!

Being a die hard Pine fan every since I discovered it (some year ago) I
thought it is about time that I make my voice heard about the few items I
have on my MOST WANTED features list... I do hope on replies,
modified/improved suggestions and a low flame level:

(I do have and use Pine-Solaris v3.94 a lot)

* Better word wrap engines.
  I'd like the interactive word wrap in the Pico editor to get better.
  Like if you write a full paragraph of a couple of lines, and then move
  to the center of the paragraph and insert or delete a lot of characters
  it doesn't do the things any user would like it to do. Since the editor
  should have stored information about which lines it wrapped
  automatically when I wrote them, it should be able to re-wrap them when
  text is edited.
  The word wrap is also a weak part when quoted text is inserted in a
  reply-mail. Lines can very well exceed my line width limit, forcing me
  to press space on the lines to make them get wrapped by the editor. Even
  that makes the quoted lines look like a mess so I have to edit them a
  lot to make them look nice again. (that is, emulate the
  emacs 'fill-paragraph'). This could possibly be fixed if Pine would
  support an external filter to do the wrapping/quoteprefixadding.
  Of course, another editor could probably do it but I love the internal
  one in all other aspects.

  (If there is any help, I have written a very powerful word wrap engine
  in fully portable C for just such a purpose. At least, support for an
  external engine would allow me to use my own...)

* Address book
  I have an address book with like ~40-50 entries and I start to feel the
  limits of pine in that area.
  First, I think moving with just cursor keys when selecting (like after a
  ^T) is too slow. I'd like to see like an incremental search or, like in
  the regular mail-index, numbered entries so I can make a JUMP
  address-number.
  More, I'd like to see a way to specify the addresses into groups. It
  would be easier to deal with lots of people in the book. I could put all
  my neighbours in my 'neighbour' group, the addresses of my team-mates in
  the 'team' group etc. It would be like having folders for addresses. It
  could possibly be nice to be able to put the same person in more than
  one group though, like if one of my neighbours is also in my team...

* Smart index scrolling
  Been said before. Why is Pine capable of scrolling the text body of any
  mail in that smart and nice way when it can't do it with the index? From
  time to time I'm forced to use pine over a 9600 bps connection, and I
  tell you that moving in the index is one of pine's weakest parts then...
 
* Threaded newsreader
  No comment needed I think. Still I understand if you don't have this on
  any high prio I thought I should mention it.

I am having difficulty getting the integrated serial upload-download 
feature to work on our system.  The few paragraphs of help in the 
Setup/Config under upload-command, upload-command-prefix, 
download-command, and download-command-prefix are not detailed enough.

Setting the download-command to sz -a causes a mail message to be 
exported to a file called PdNNNNNN on the local machine, but leaves the 
Pine session stuck with some zmodem result message garbage beginning with 
asterisks on the screen that it tries to process as commands, causing it 
to go to the flag screen and set and unset the flag until all the

Setting the upload-command to rz fails completely.

Am I missing something obvious?

Has someone prepared a more detailed help document that I could look at?

We're running Pine 3.94 on AIX 3.2.5 on our test machine.  Testing has 
mostly been from Hyperterminal on Windows 95.

Use some cryptography program.  With PGP, you can encrypt a message with
all the public keys of *a subset* of the subscribed recipients and
*only them* shall be able to decrypt it.

If the address is in the message header, yes.
Hit   t   (Take).  Pine will show you the address(es) it found in the
message header.  You can select one (or both/all) of the addresses shown
and then hit t for take again and they will be added to the addressbook.

Tried the (T)ake address command? (Don't know from what version that came,
one helluva cool command though! ;)

Yes.  Press T (Take command) while on the message in the index or while in
(viewing) the message contents. 

You might want to check out the various Pine Help screens. They are
contextual (apply to what you are currently doing) and very good.

Pan,
You keep asserting that Pine is incapable of 8BITMIME negotiation, yet
others on this list have reported that it works for them.  If there is in
fact a bug that is preventing the negotiation from happening in some
situations, we'd really like some more data to track it down, but so far
we don't have anything to go on.

Note that ESMTP capability does not necessarily imply 8BITMIME capability
on the part of the MTA... 8BITMIME is just one possible option that might
be negotiated using the ESMTP framework.  Note also as Jungshik Shin
mentioned that a subsequent MTA could downgrade the message to 7bit.

	I see you are using pine 3.93.  Well, in that case it should
also search the body.....

	Use t(ake) here and test....

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I am trying to run the imapd server on version 10.01 of HP/UX,
configured as a trusted system.  When the imapd server attempts to
verify the user/password, it always fails, because it is unable, I
believe, to verify the passowrd.  We had a similar problem with a POP
server from Qualcomm that, when we forced it to make calls to getprpwnam
(password functions) seemed to work fine.  This was a compile time
option.  Is there a version of imapd which is built specifically for
HP/UX 10.X or a kludge that is documented?

Thanks,

Bryan,
     Check out the Pine FAQ at 

     http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/faq/
     ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/faq

In the FAQ you get instructions on generating a blank personal config file by 
running

     "pine -P pinerc.blank"

I've never had to generate a blank .pinerc -- Can anyone verify that this is 
still the valid method for generating it?

I have more that one incoming message folders in my pine set up.  Does 
anyone know how I get incoming mail to choose one of my other folders vs 
my INBOX?  Is some type of filtering necessary?

i created an incoming mail folder in pine 3.94 without a problem.  but 
when i realized that i had set the path incorrectly, i wanted to delete 
it and add it again with the correct path.  when i deleted it, it removed 
itself from the screen but appeared again when i reloaded pine later.  
both the old and the new folders were there with the same nickname.

attempts to delete it again failed.  only when i edited .pinerc did it go 
away.  strange, no?

Pine 3.94 was just released a few weeks ago.

    There is *no* mailcap file in any directory in the PATH defined to
my Un*x shell.  Digging around, I found one mailcap file in a directory
with 'X11' as part of the directory path, so I am guessing that that
one has to do with X-terms, and I am using VT100 emulation.  There is
another, almost 2 1/2 years old, mailcap file in /usr/local/etc, which
is not in my PATH.  I don't know whether Pine can find a mailcap file
(or any other file) not in my PATH -- I'm guessing not -- so Pine as I
use it may be running without a mailcap at all, if that's possible.

    If a sample mailcap is included with the Pine distribution, my
service provider's Technical Staff seem to have hidden it when they
installed 3.94 recently.  They didn't even announce the installation --
it just magically showed up one day when I went to start Pine.  I
suppose I could copy that old mailcap in /usr/local/etc into $HOME and
play around with it.

    I have good luck (starting with 3.91 and continuing all the way
through 3.94) downloading from Un*x Pine to my DOS PC using the Pine
pipe feature and a simple shell script.  I just have enable-pipe-
command (or whatever it's called without looking) set in my
configuration.  Then, whenever I want to download a message, I just
enter the vertical bar (|) as a command and answer the prompt with
sendz, which is what I have named this script:

      #!/bin/sh
      umask 066
      trap "rm -f $HOME/tmp/$$junk" 0
      cat > $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
      sz -a $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
      rm -f $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
      umask 077

It starts a Zmodem transfer, which ProComm Plus v2 on my PC
automatically picks up, and the transfer goes without a problem.  (The
only thing is that the received file is named download.nnn, where 'nnn'
is the first three digits of the Un*x process number, so you have to
watch for that.)  Of course, someone else might need to modify the
directory path for a different configuration.

    I admit I have not worked out a method for uploading directly into
Pine.  Usually I do uploads separately.  Hope this may be of help to
somebody.

I am sorry to be the only one who keeps moaning about this capability.
I hope I am not doing anything wrong.


Well, following is the description of one of my many tests where
8 bit posting proves unsuccessful.
I am posting a mail message with greek characters both in the body
and in the subject.
The posting is done from host hermes.cti.gr to dimakop@thalis.ceid.upatras.=
gr.
In the first case I send the mail with the simple command "Mail -v"
and I have included its output later on. The mail arrives in 8 bits!
Afterwards I do the posting with pine 3.94 where the enable 8 bit posting
setting is on as it can be seen from the debug file I have included.
In that case the message arrives completely in MIME (QP). Actually
the message content is almost the same in both cases.
I also include the output of port 25 on both systems so that you see
the exact sendmail version.

Message-Id: <Pine.LNX.3.94.960710083345.5915A-100000@net161-61.student.yale.edu>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

  
  Hello,

  I sent following message to the address for Pine feature suggestion,
but haven't received any response, automatic or human. I understand well
that Pine team can't reply to all individual suggestions, but
automatic(machine) response would be better than no response at all.
Hence, I decided to sent it to pine-info.  I would be very grateful to
Pine team if this patch is accepted and included in upcoming
release(3.95) of Pine. It's for Korean mail exchange compliant to RFC
1557 and dose NOTHING if charset is NOT set to 'iso-2022-kr' (Korean
mail exchange code).


    Jungshik Shin

-------------------
  To whom it may concern:

  First of all, I'd like to express my deep thanks for developing
wonderful mail program, Pine. I have a small patch to
strings.c in Pine 3.94 source to support RFC 1557
(Korean mail exchange standard similar to those for
Japanese - RFC 1468- and Chinese - RFC 1922- mail.).

  RFC 1557 states that Korean message body in EUC-KR (KSC 5601) be
encoded in ISO-2022-KR(again similar to ISO-2022-JP and ISO-2022-CN),
which is 7bit. Body encoding/decoding can be handled by 'sending filter'
and 'displayfilter' and doesn't have any problem with Pine with possible
exception of Pine 3.93 under Solaris 2.4 where my filter program leads
to error.  It's also stated that 8bit EUC-KR in header of a message be
either B encoded or Q encoded with charset name 'EUC-KR'.  However,
'Content-Type:' header is specified to have 'iso-2022-kr' as the value
for the parameter 'charset'. Thus, Korean message header should look
like following

Subject: =?EUC-KR?B?<B encoded euc-kr>?=
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-kr
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit



  Unfortunately, current version of Pine (3.92,3.93,3.94) doesn't offer a
way to specify two different character set names to use in 'charset='
field and encoding of 8bit characters in header. It's understandable
that Pine doesn't have that facility since RFC 1557 is rather peculiar
in this aspect.  RFC 1468 and 1922 don't mention about header. What my
patch to 'strings.c' does is use 'EUC-KR' as 'charset' name in  encoding
of 8bit chars in header IF and ONLY IF 'charset' designated in 'pinerc'
is 'iso-2022-kr'(case insensitive). One more it does is enforce 'B'
encoding of header when 'charset' in 'pinerc' is 'iso-2022-kr'. The
latter is not required by RFC 1557, which specifies that either Q or B
encoding can be used, but is necessary since most of RFC 1557
implementation(modified Sendmail for Korean. MTA-level implementation
was inevitable as  POP3 clients such as Netscape and Eudora don't
support RFC 1557) used in and outside Korea recognize and decode only B
encoding (of course, MIME-capable MUA can handle Q encoding as well).

  My patch has absolutely NO effect at all if 'charset' is NOT
'iso-2022-kr' and accordingly I think it fits well. Before
my patch is accepted and reflected in newer version of Pine,
I'd like to know if I could distribute my patch as 'Pine 3.94K'
('K' for Korean. I think 'L' is too generic).

  Once again, I greatly appreciate you for an excellent  mail
program and wish my patch would be carefully considered.

   Sincerely,

    Jungshik Shin

Prior to printing to 'attached to ansi', Pine sends an ANSI setup sequence
esc-5i (I think) to the printer, then resets it with an esc-6i.  It's not
the printer you're using, but rather the terminal emulator package you use
to connect to the host you're running Pine on. 

e.g. NCSA supposedly eats these control codes and interprets them 
properly. Try the same thing, but use a different terminal emulator to 
get to the host - that may "cure" it. I think I'm just going to cut these 
to lines out of the source to see if it makes a difference.

This is configurable in the m4 source for sendmail.cf ....

define(`confSMTP_MAILER', `smtp8')dnl
define(`SMART_HOST', `smtp8:mailbox.swip.net')dnl

My /usr/site/mail/cf/mailer/smtp.m4 Msmtp8 definition looks like so...
Msmtp8,		P=[IPC], F=CONCAT(mDFMuX8, SMTP_MAILER_FLAGS), S=11/31, R=ifdef(`_ALL_MASQUERADE_', `21/31', `21'), E=\r\n, L=990,
		_OPTINS(`SMTP_MAILER_MAX', `M=', `, ')_OPTINS(`SMTP_MAILER_CHARSET', `C=', `, ')T=DNS/RFC822/SMTP,
		A=SMTP8_MAILER_ARGS

But this is standard from sendmail-8.7.5, so it shouldn't need to be 
touched!

If You are lazy, it's the `8' in the mailer flags (mDFMuX8) that `does 
it'. You can dedit Your standard smtp mailer directly in /etc/sendmail.cf
and enter that `8' there:

Msmtp,		P=[IPC], F=mDFMuX8e, S=11/31, R=21, E=\r\n, L=990,
		T=DNS/RFC822/SMTP,
		A=IPC $h

The drawback of following these instructions is that the ESMTP negotiation
protocol will be broken. We will ALWAYS send just 8. The CORRECT WAY of
doing it is to set up with mailertables a list of known 8bit hosts, and use
the smtp8 mailer ONLY WITH THOSE HOSTS!

PS: I do work for money! Need any practical assistance? I can log in over 
the internet and fix things for You ... I know virtual domains, procmail,
reverse aliasing, the works! I also plan to patch Pine to have a feature
that makes it send 8BITMIME even when sendmail is called on the command
line.

	Sounds like you should complain to the keepers of the mirrors....
(You didn't even tell us where they are...so it is kind of hard to

Ugha. Extremely embarrasing to mention, but it was my fault not having
write permissing in my current local dir... There's my punishment for

What you do is enter in the persons address in the To: field put in a
comma and then type in :; (i.e. To: johnd@network.com, :;).  This way it
will
say:
	To: John Doe <johnd@network.com>
	From: Pagemaster 
	Subject: whatever 

OR If you (like and)are using 3.93 there is a feature called
empty-header-message where you can add in what ever.  This is where the
Undisclosed recipients comes from.  Warning... this is what will show up
every time just like Undisclosed recipients.  I have mine set to say : A
list of my favorite people.

Hope this helps!

In the configuration screen there are two features that you can play
around with that will accomplish the same thing is different ways.

1.)  default-composer-hdrs:  Here you can add the headers that you would
like to see all the time.  You HAVE to enter in the normal fields (i.e.
To, Subject, etc) and then also enter in Reply-to:.  Now when you compose
a message what ever fields you entered in that area will always show up as
the header.  If this confuses you when you are in the configuration screen
and have the feature selected type a ? and it will bring you to a help
screen.

2.)  customized-hdrs:  Here you can just add in the Reply-to: header, you
do not have to enter in the rest of the headers.  This will cause the
Reply-to header to be in the rich header when you compose a message.  In
other words you would have to do a ^R (control R) when in the compose
screen to get the heading up.

Hope this helps!

hi.. please help me w/ this:

let's say i'm writing some letters and use ^O so that they will be stored 
in the postponed-msgs folder file..  Then i want to send ALL messages in 
that folder! one way to do it is to go through every message in the 
postpones-msgs folder and press C, ^X on every one.. very time consuming..
so, please! isn't there anyway to send all msgs at one time? it doesnt 
have to be done in pine, any unix command combination would do.. HELP!

Hi all

I would really like to use vi with Pine instead of Pico.  How can I do
this?

Actually, I would like Pine to use vi as the primary editor, not an
alternate that I can choose once a mail session has begun.  I noticed
there is an "alternate editor" line in .pinerc.  What about for the
primary editor?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.   btw- I looked for the FAQ on
the newsgroup and there doesnt' seem to be one.  Otherwise I would've
tried that first!   :-)

Hi All!
  First time post - sorry if this is silly but is there a version of 
Pine for the Macintosh?  I know this is a text-based e-mailer, but since it 
was also available for the Wintel machines I thought I would just ask.  
It's really great in the unix world.  Thanks up-front.

Sure.

Enable both enable-alternate-editor-cmd and
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly in the setup and then set your
alternate editor. :)

I've got a major lock problem here on my system.  After upgrading to Linux
2.0 from 1.2.13 and also swapping disks (involving the tarring and
untarring of large volumes of files :) my user pine mailboxes (inbox AND
all user-created boxes) have locks on them that will not go away.  I've
checked permissions, tried find for .pine or .lock files, in short done
just about everything I could think of, yet these locks remain.  The
side-note is that all root mailboxes work fine.  I had the problem under
3.91 but since upgraded to 3.94 and the problems remain.
Please help, it's been plaguing me for days!
Thanks!

I was sitting at my desk when suddenly, I got the following message in my
PINE window

MAIL FOLDER "INBOX" CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR

Can somebody out there tell me what events can cause this to happen ?

I am running Pine 3.94 on Solaris 2.4 (on a Sparc 5 - if it makes a
difference).

In my case where 8 bit posting does not work with pine I have set this

Msmtp,		P=[IPC], F=mDFMuX8, S=11/31, R=21, E=\r\n, L=990,
		T=DNS/RFC822/SMTP,
		A=IPC $h, C=iso-8859-7
Mesmtp,		P=[IPC], F=mDFMuXa8, S=11/31, R=21, E=\r\n, L=990,
		T=DNS/RFC822/SMTP,
		A=IPC $h, C=iso-8859-7
Msmtp8,		P=[IPC], F=mDFMuX8, S=11/31, R=21, E=\r\n, L=990,
		T=DNS/RFC822/SMTP,
		A=IPC $h, C=iso-8859-7
Mrelay,		P=[IPC], F=mDFMuXa8, S=11/31, R=61, E=\r\n, L=2040,
		T=DNS/RFC822/SMTP,
		A=IPC $h, C=iso-8859-7


However when I send mail with the simple "Mail -v <user>@<host>"
command 8 bits are transferred accross - which means that my
sendmail configuration allows 8 bit negotiation.

Thanks,

Well, I am trying to make a mailertable work (sendmail 8.7.5) for a reall=
y
long time. My UserDB works, but my mailertable does not. I tried all
possible db methods. Format of mailertable is like the following:

.gr			smtp8:%1.gr
muni.cz			smtp8:muni.cz
uivt1.uivt.cas.cz	smtp8:uivt1.uivt.cas.cz

Do you see anything wrong? If anyone can help me, I will appreciated it
very much!

Thank in advance,

Now it works. I did not get the idea a few months but I've got it having
sent the question to pine-info :-) The problem was that some rulesets wer=
e
commented out. I only had to find all occurences of the word mailertavble
and uncommented those rulesets. And now it works. I included well-known
8bit-clean domains (.su, .ru, .gr) into it and I hope everything is OK
even for non-8BITMIME SMTP servers there.

Sorry for asking you. Regards, V. S.

I keep having these weird lockups/hangs that look like they might be
caused by locking problems... Pine 3.94, SunOS, hangs and never comes
back, unless I strace the process, which somehow kicks it out of the hung
state.

It happens when updating mail folders in my home directory, which is
mounted via AFS. Perhaps there should be a way to enable _only_ .lock file
locking everywhere, so that flock() could be eliminated entirely? Or maybe
the locks need to be set up so that they don't block? I've noticed that
not all flock calls are non-blocking...

Thanks,

-Eric

I have compiled pine3.93 with the ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM dircetive,

Nw pine allows me to change the From: line, but the default displayed

How can I force a different From: header that stays that way?

i'm using popclient to retreive my mail from my mailserver.. and it works 
just fine.. but, i want to be able to write/reply to msgs /offline/ and 
then send all msgs in one folder.. maybe you know how to do it?  let's 
say you're using ^O [postpone] instead of ^X [send] so that all outgoing 
mail ends up in the postponed-msgs folder..  if you only had some program 
that would take all msgs from one folder-file and send them! well well..

I think this new is too late for you, but you can try to use a site
"www.pobox.org.sg/welcome.html", it is a free e-mail box for you to
link upto three accounts and forward your mail to a new account, for

The best tool for this that I know of is Procmail.  It allows you to
set up a powerful set of rules that process any incoming mail.  Among
the things you can do with it is sorting incoming mail into different
folders.

hi,

   i'm having a problem with pine 3.94 (running on sunos 4) hanging when i
use display- and sending-filters.  i originally encountered the problem
when trying to integrate pgp scripts to automate encryption and decryption
(using both the methods proposed by jie yuan and by roland rosenfeld), but
i got the same problem using a non-pgp filter as well.

   here's the problem: using display-filters, the filter works the first
time it is triggered, but the second time it is triggered, pine hangs, and
i have to kill the pine process.  this isn't pgp-specific--i tried using
the display filter

     "" /bin/grep the

and got the same problem--it worked the first time i read a message but
not on subsequent messages.

   pine also hangs using sending filters--if i compose a message and then
select a filter (e.g. pgpencrypt), pine hangs and i have to kill it.  the
message *does* get sent, however (and it's encrypted). 

   i saw a message earlier about pine hanging on the second time you try
to print something--i'm wondering if this is the same kind of problem.

   anyone have the same experience?  thanks for any help!

						bob

How do I configure pine and pico so that my arrow keys actually send 
arrows to move the cursor?  I am using wyse60 emulation if that is any 
help.  Any reponse is appreciated.

    I am a bit puzzled.  If you are postponing messages for no other
reason than to try to be able to send them all at once, wouldn't it be
easier simply just to send each one with ^X as soon as it is ready
rather than save it with ^O and then horse around later trying to
cobble together something which may or may not work sending the whole
pile at once?  Do you have some special reason for delaying
transmission of messages and for sending multiple messages
simultaneously?  Perhaps a little more information might make it a
little easier for people to offer technical suggestions.

Users have received messages produced by Eudora Lite or Microsoft Exchange
which do not have CR/LFs on the lines in the paragraph.  AIX 3.94 pine or
3.91 PC-Pine nicely displays the body of the message however when replying
or forwarding the message the lines are not wrapped for display purposes.

Is there a feature or option to make this happen?

Hello
I believe there may be a bug in the Patron Menu, or at least in
mine.  Under "new messages" it lists the New messages as 0 even though I
have received several messages.  The "Total messages" does show the
correct quantity of messages received, but as I said new messages alway's
is listed as 0.  I don't know if anyone else is suffering with the same
problem.  Can this be corrected?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I am trying to use pine's display filters to run lynx to view an HTML
document sent to me via email.  After several attempts, I can't seem
to get it right.  What is wrong with placing this in the display
filters section of the config?

"<html>" /usr/local/bin/lynx -force_html  _TMPFILE_

I get Permission denied as an error message.  The only thing I can
thinkof is that _TMPFILE_ is unable to be read, since I have tried
things like "html" /usr/bin/cat _TMPFILE_ with the same result.

Thanks 
Ray

	Yep.  Put you cursor on the offending looong line and hit
^J (Cntrl-J).  It'll "justify" it....

Dear all,

	I know there is a 'fingering" program which tells the user when
his/her specified receipients are logged on/off, while the user is logged
on. (The user does not have to finger the email addresses individually, 
this program has the capability to generate who has just logged on or
off). 
	Can anyone point me to an internet site or source to dowload this
program. Thank you very much for you help.

    No problem.

    From the Main Menu, go into Setup and Config.  (By the way, I am
assuming that your Pine is at least at version 3.91 and is not
PC-Pine.) Scroll down a ways and check
"enable-alternate-editor-implicitly." Then scroll down almost to the
bottom of the configuration options and in the "editor" field fill in
the full path to vi (/usr/ucb/vi or whatever it is on your machine). 
That's all there is to it.  Then, whenever you start to compose an
actual message body or initiate a reply, you will get vi instead of
the Pine composer (Pico).

We are running pine 3.94 (compiled with gcc-2.7.2 and SunPro)
and having a major problem using imap type mailboxes.  The systems
are DX4/100's with 24 MB of memory, and when we run pine opening
a imap mailbox, the whole system hangs.  Trussing pine doesn't
show anything out of the ordinary.  We have to reboot the system
since it locks up so badly.  Anyone have any ideas?

I think you're going at it from the wrong end.  Add this line to your
$HOME/.mailcap (or whatever mailcap your pine looks at):

  text/html ; lynx -force_html %s ; needsterminal

Thanks, Ed, I appreciate the simple reply (got to 
space around the > though) however it would be nicer to 
handle it on a wider perspective. I would think it would be 
in the SMTP protocol not to create long lines.  As an aside 
we also use Simeon and it doesn't wrap it in the viewer 
like pine or elm does so it is an annoyance for recipients.

Subject: Need to stack a ctrl-L after printing
Date: Thu, 11 Jul 96 17:19:33 EDT
Message-Id: <177C1F3A5S86.MMILLER@UGA.CC.UGA.EDU>

   I have a 'generic' print command ( a perl program called UGAPRINT ) we
   would like to set as the default print command in Pine. The UGAPRINT
   command displays a menu of the student labs on campus as well as a
   'print-to-ansi' option. I do an open(MYTTY,'+>/dev/tty/') to get
   control of the screen to display the menu and interact with the user.
 
   It handles the piped input from Pine fine, but when it gets back to
   Pine, the screen is blank (or mostly blank) and one has to do a
   ctrl-L to redraw the screen. I'm looking for a way to 'stack' a
   ctrl-L after the print. Everything I do from my print program gets
   captured for display on the status line. I looked briefly at the
   Pine code and tried doing an  ungetc  at the end of  close_printer
   thinking that read_command would pick it up, but that approach did
   not seem to work.
 
   Any suggestion you have on how to approach this (like the best place
   in the Pine code to force a redraw after a print) would be appreciated.
   The brute force way appears to be duplicating secitons of code in routines
   addrbook.c , folder.c , help.c , mailcmd.c , mailview.c , and other.c
   but I want to avoid that if I can.
                                                  Thanks in Advance,
                                                      Michael

Well, it's not totally removed. You can fix it easily.

There's a port of pine 3.94 available at ftp.freebsd.org in the

Actually, from a little bit of trial and error, pine 3.94 builds and works
flawlessly (from what i've been able to tell) if you select netbsd
('build neb' i think) as the platform you are building for.

Hope I'm able to help.

Also my web page for configuring pgp in pine 3.92 (or newer).  It is
simple and can be used under csh, ksh, sh, etc., and it does NOT need
Perl.  Well, it is for unix pine.  I am not sure how to do pc pine.

If you are on Unix, do a "man vacation" for more info.  Any way, Pine 
does not do this kind of chore.

	It so happens that I'm a historian of tongues. I know
very well what the word 'expunge' means in normal English, and
what its history is, too. That does not for one moment imply
that I have some magical insight into the electronic details of
the function which the pine builders choose to designate by that
term -- any more than most native speakers of English would know
what mathematicians choose to designate by such terms as
'everywhere dense,' 'locally differentiable,' 'existential
quantifier,' 'pairwise disjoint,' or a whole host of others. Nor
should they. 
	To suppose otherwise is an abuse of this forum, which
for years has been exemplary in its courtesy to the inquiring. I
have not previously seen an outburst of profanity nor any other
sort of absurd high dudgeon -- especially against a relative
newcomer, least of all from another newcomer.
	What's more, the (online!) manual for pine is one of the
least useful I've encountered: you practically have to be a unix
guru even to find anything in it, let alone make sense of it. It
is true that the context-sensitive help is better -- but, by its
very brevity, often less than an intermediate user really wants.
	In particular, other mailers (such as both of my others) 
have a file13 into which deleted messages go; one can even
sometimes set the default retention period on it. That turns out
to be a useful feature:  if I delete something in error, or only
discover three days later that I had another use for it, I can
still recover. I would wish that pine acquire some such feature
-- unless it's already there (in 3.93) and I haven't spotted it
yet ....
	As for the hothead who couldn't control his ire, I have
put him into a killfile on my skimming reader (I wish pine had
them!), and will bounce anything that comes to my pine
account from that address. Ten to one most of you feel the same.
	-- Hmmm: I wonder if it was even genuine. The diatribe
did seem a little _too_ vacuous, overblown, and long-winded; and
the poster wasn't familiar. Maybe some nut was just looking for
a place to flame something, and Ms. Scanlon was the first target
(s)he found; there are people on the Net who are low enough to
do that ....

Hi all.  Our provider just switched over to Pine V3.94 and although I have
had no trouble using it so far, I was looking at some of the new features
in the setup section and kept seeing references to something called the
"file browser."  can anyone tell me what this is and what it is for?  I
see no reference to in in any of the menus.
thanks.

I don't think it can be done with pine,

You might try 'mpack'

If you want a copy of the manpage, send me a message with the SUBJECT

send-ascii mpack.1


I use 'mpack' in my procmail RC file to send people auto-responses  
via MIMEmail.

The TakeAddr command is for just that. Try 'T' while you're on the

We had set up the vacation utility to auto answer but it did not
decode MIME messages when we wanted to include a piece of the
received message (the subject for instance) in the answer.

Does anybody know if procmail or any other auto answer package
can do this properly?

I'm getting this in Solaris 2.5 as well, but it came on me all of a sudden,
and other users on the same system can't duplicate it.  I'm wondering if
there's an INBOX corruption involved?  Are the other people who are getting
this reading their mail on the same system they're invoking PINE from, or
remotely?

Referring mostly to this "Bovine Remailer" type of guy, who seems to have
lost his own education, namely good manners, somewhere on the road between
his childhood and the moment of his news posting.  I prefer people who do 
not know certain facts over people who can't behave.

Back to the subject: EXPUNGE

To all of this discussion I might add my personal guess, that the vast
majority of pine users around the planet are non-native speakers of English,
and at least I heard the word "expunge" for the first time in my life, when
pine asked whether to expunge a message or not.  And I really needed the help
of a dictionary to figure out what this all is about.

Thus, I consider the use of this term confusing, at least it is not immediately
clear to everyone what it means.  This is against the idea of pine, to
provide an easy to use mail program.  Yes, probably there are many more
things in pine which are against this idea, and yes, maybe it is true, that
one has to be a UNIX Guru to work things out...

I cannot really judge this, because I happen to know UN*X very well, and I am
using the network and e-mail for a long time now.  But this is a strong 
argument as to whether or not "expunge" is a easy word, that when I as a
somewhat experienced user changed from elm to pine about half a year ago,
I ran into troubles.


And the moral?  Never flame somebody today for what you might do yourself
tomorrow, i.e., asking for something you do not know!

All the best from the land of the midnight sun,

Thank you for your comments.
I followed your suggestion and I send a mail message with
enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation and without any sendmail fixed path in
any of the configuration files. Now I got 8 bits passed through but
for the body only - the subject arrived encoded in MIME.
I am including the message as it is kept in the mail box in the
arriving host and the debug output of pine -d 9.

(The direction of my mailing now is the other way round compared to
the previous test I sent to the pine list yesterday. Now the mail
was sent from dimakop@thalis.ceid.upatras.gr to dimakop@hermes.cti.gr)

Strong support for this view!

I echo this. I give regular coures in Pine, and a large percentage of my
students are not English native speakers (I have Chinese, Japanese,
Africans, all flavours of European, and so on).

I do not even teach them about expunge because I rate the word as
extremely likely to be outside their vocabularies, and I am having quite
enough trouble teaching the basics.

But I do find Pine easy to teach, even to students who have no prior
experience of ANYTHING (this is in fact the primary reason we chose Pine
- though the fact that it is free also helped :-) )

I would very much appreciate an easier linguistic alternative for
expunge. WipeOut comes to mind (but of course conflicts with WhereIs; 
there are no spare letters in Pine!). Another mailer I used to use had
Tidy for this verb. eXterminate is probably well understood, but
possibly a bit long for the "hints lines".

	There is also a link on the home page I maintain for the
PGP-users mailing list that links to a page showing step-by-step how
to integrate PGP with Pine. Its really neat.

Attached to this message is a patch to pine3.94/pine/send.c created by the
Pine development team.  I've received numerous messages about the crash
caused by bouncing messages and am posting the patch myself until Pine 3.95
is released.

To apply the patch, extract the attached file to 'send.patch', cd to the
pine3.94/pine/ subdirectory of the distribution, and type:
    patch <../whatever/directory/send.patch

Make sure you use GNU patch or a fairly new BSD or SVR4 based patch program.
(Most recent OS releases will accept the patch.)

For all that I know, 8 bit in headers is not allowed at all. It has
nothing to do with ESMTP, which governs only body of message. So, Pine is
quite correct on that matter.

Or am I wrong?

	Well, I too have a diverse group to work with.  Some with UNIX
knowledge, some without.  Some with a good command of spoken English,
most without.  Can't say that I've had too much difficulty explaining
to them what expunge did.  Most of them had more trouble pronouncing it
than anything.  The groups that I've worked with generally see the
opportunity to learn a new word and once they learn the word....they
don't seem to forget.  Sometimes the sentences they produce to "show off"
their newly gained knowledge can bring a chuckle to your lips.

	I suppose I could be just lucky to have worked with a select
group of people who were not adverse to learning.

    However, you were asking about Pine in a Pine newsgroup.  To the
best of my knowledge, Pine does *NO* offline activity at all.  It is
strictly interactive.  When Pine is not running interactively, then
Pine is not running at all and can do nothing.  You cannot even run it
in a "batch" mode from the command line.  For good or for ill, that's
the way Pine was designed and built.  You seem to be wanting to do
something Pine was never designed for and therefore cannot do.  Sorry. 
Perhaps you could find some useful information on one of the other mail
newsgroups.  I doubt that you can do what you want to do with Pine. 
(Better informed opinion welcome.)

It is a system to automatically delete, hide or mark mails/articles posted
by a certain person, discussing certain subjects or containing certain
matters. Powerful kill file systems usually feature extensive regexp
patters to enable all sorts of different filtering/masking.

There is. Set the environment variable TZ to the value <time
zone><offset><DST time zone>, for example:

SET TZ=EST-4EDT

(I don't know what the correct offset for EST is)

<time zone> is your standard time zone, abbreviated to three characters.

<offset> is the difference to GMT, not accounting for DST. (I have
observed that PC Pine changes the sign, so use negative offsets for
Europe, and positive for America :-( Try which works for you by sending an
e-mail to yourself.)

<DST time zone> is the name of your time zone for DST (daylight savings
time), again abbreviated to three characters.

Put the SET command into your AUTOEXEC.BAT (or CONFIG.SYS, for MS DOS 6.x)
file.

	I tried Pine 3.94. It was nice. When I tried to open INBOX on
another host, it was empty. But when I logged on to the other host, it
said that I had mail. Why? (That problem also came up in my old verrsion
of Pine, 3.91. )

I have been following a couple of very active news groups and really need 
to get some filtering going.
Can anyone point me to instructions on implementing a filter/killfile for 
Pine running on a Sun SPARC?

    So far as I know, Pine does not have killfile capability for either
mail or news.  For Un*x Pine users, something like procmail or filter
can handle mail, but I know of nothing for news.  If someone sends you
a technique that works, please be kind enough to share it, as I would
be interested, and quite possibly others would be as well.

A file browser is a menu-type interface that allows you to search through
directories for a file.  It is usefull for attaching a file using MIME when
the exact name and location of the file is unknown.

I do have a genuine reason for wanting to do this. Setting up accounts
for a practical session after (or during) an email course involves the
rather tedious sending of lots of mail so that they have something to
play with. I do have these all ready to go in a folder, copy them all
to postponed, and then send them off one at a time, and it would be nice
to do it in one operation. 

With current Pine releases it is actually possible to run disconnected
so long as you dont try to use the link. I have not tried, but imagine
it is possible to compose and postpone, and then send all the messages
once the link has been established. This would be an efficient way of
working (until genuine Pine disconnected operation becomes available).

Unfortunately ; A A C (in the postponed folder) is not in the allowed
set.

    However, you were asking about Pine in a Pine newsgroup.  To the
best of my knowledge, Pine does *NO* offline activity at all.  It is
strictly interactive.  When Pine is not running interactively, then
Pine is not running at all and can do nothing.  You cannot even run it
in a "batch" mode from the command line.  For good or for ill, that's
the way Pine was designed and built.  You seem to be wanting to do
something Pine was never designed for and therefore cannot do.  Sorry. 
Perhaps you could find some useful information on one of the other mail
newsgroups.  I doubt that you can do what you want to do with Pine. 
(Better informed opinion welcome.)

William:

First, don't include the whole message in the message Subject title.
Every Internet message consists of (at least) two parts - message header
and message body. The header is all that stuff that has the form
<keyword>: <some text>, like From:, To:, Subject:, etc. The header is
separated from the body by a blank line, or a line with some dashes, or,
with PINE, by a line with some dashes and the words 'Message Text.' The
message body starts below that line and should contain what you actually
want to say.

Maybe your messages got lost on their way because some computer couldn't
interpret that long Subject: line in the header.

Maybe you made some error in the recipient's e-mail address. While most
systems return e-mails which they cannot pass on, some don't and simply
swallow it. Did your friend ever send you an e-mail? If so, (while in the
message viewer) press R for reply, and type in something, and press Ctrl-X
(send) to mail the message this should, in most cases, work. If it
doesn't, there is a high likelihood that your friend has made an error in
setting up his/her e-mail.

Just to test - send me an e-mail. My account works well. My e-mail address
(also present in the messages's header) is
hans.schleichert@uni-tuebingen.de

Ah - one more thing. On the To: line, you may enter the person's name
along with his/her e-mail address. Enclose the name in "double quotes,"
and the e-mail address in <angle brackets> if you do that. This resolves
most of the trouble.

Hope this helps.

Greetings:
  I've been using PINE for over 3 years.  I would like to propose that PINE
support the Post Office Protocol (POP3).  This is especially important to
members of internet service providers!!!
  As the internet is becoming more accessable, so is the need to retrieve
electronic mail.  PINE works GREAT from a localized host machine, or from a
localized mail server.  When it comes to remote Email access (from external
mail source/domain), PINE chokes!!!
  Please let me know what you think.  We know that PINE supports SMTP, NNTP,
MIME and IMAP.  Now we need the added support of POP3 to make PINE complete!

Thank you for your time,

Well, Pine already supports pop3! :) 

The folder name is:

{your.mail.server.com/pop3}


(Ofcourse, all messages are automagically expunged from the server when
they're downloaded, atleast to my knowledge.)

I type with Times font and save as a text file.  When I paste to e-mail, 
all quotes marks and apostrophes turn into other characters (consistently 
the same characters).  My provider tech support could not help.

The use of the word "bounce" above stumbles on a bit of computerese. It 
gives me an interesting idea, which would make for a fine feature
request for pine, one much enjoyed by the vengeful at heart. Why not add
the option to quickly and easily bounce flames, etc. posted to
newsgroups back the the original author? Every time you read a post and
find it to be full of bile, one click and the author gets a piece of
e-mail saying something like "<Name> found the following post to
<newsgroup> unhelpful, uninformative and unpleasant. He/she has opted to
return it to you. (copy of post follows) ..."

Every bit of nastiness becomes an invitation to participate in a mass
mailbomb.

Impractical? Perhaps. Satisfying? Definitely.

  Pine's sort indexes are not good at all. The Date sort is particularly
horrible as there are several entries not sorted correctly.

Why not just have your ISP install imapd?  IMAP is a functional superset
of POP so you will not lose anything by using IMAP to access your folders.
Also note that there is no problem with your ISP supporting both IMAP
and POP (for those poor souls who are using a POP client).

The 8BITMIME ESMTP option only applies to message body parts.  The
headers are still required to be 7bit clean.  Pine therefore encodes
them according to RFC1522....

I have set up filter and have 'lost' a few messages. They save to the

saying it did. Is this the 'file locking' problem I keep hearing about?
If so, what do I need to do?

I had tried to post a message that asked how I could attach a file to a 
message on the command line, but I am not sure the message ever made it 
off my server. 

In any case, I am trying to do what I want with the -i or -I option 
(which one do I use?). I can get into the compose mode, but I cannot tab 
between header lines (address, cc, attachments, etc.). I have seen CR 
used as a carriage return in the documentation, but I cannot get it to 
work. Can anyone help me out here?

  Sure. I set all the sorts to Date by putting the X in the config file.
But then when I go into any folder they are not sorted. Like:


Jul 	12
Jun 	6
Jun	12
Jun	25
Jul	7
Jul	11
Jul	11
Jul	13
Jul	12
Jul	13
Jul	13

  Even if I do a manual sort using $ from the options bar below, it still
won't sort date correctly.

Subject: Printing Problems with Pine and LANWG/WP 5.0
Date: 9 Jul 1996 14:40:03 GMT
Message-Id: <4rtr03$i8d@news.sdsmt.edu>

Recently, our network administrator upgraded our system from Novell's
LANWG 4.2 to LANWG 5.0.  Prior to the upgrade, we were able to print
from pine without problems.  Now, following the upgrade, we are not
able to print from pine.  After printing the message, the computer
seems to "hang".  Any keys pressed on the keyboard cause the printer
to print a few lines of garbage.  It appears as though the system is
not recognizing the "stop" codes at the end of a message.  The only
way we've found of clearing things is to completely reboot the PC.  
This is only happening when we initiate telnet sessions through DOS
using tnvt220.  When we use the host presenter option through Windows,
printing works just fine.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Any
help would be greatly appreciated!  The host machine is an RS/6000
running AIX 3.2.5 and pine 3.93.

Shirley

	Sorry, I should have been a bit more explicit.  It would be
helpful if we know the details of the Date: lines.

	I've see other UAs generate Date lines like:

Date: Wed, 3 Jul 1996 11:40:46 +-5-30

	And, yes Pine didn't put it in the "correct" place....but I'm
not so sure I'd blame pine.

	So, what may be needed is for you to collect the Date: lines
in the order they appear in your spool file and then indicate the
way they were displayed for a particular sort key.

	Regards,

		Ed

I know how to extract an entire message from pine 3.94--but
is it possible to mark and extract selected text, to be sent
to a file or held for insertion into another message?

Thanks--

Annelise

P.S. This is pine on FreeBSD.

	Hi,

I can't reply to two people in pine 3.94.  Pine helps me to seperate the
two people with the correct character (comma), but when i do a reply, i'm
getting only the last address.
I can do a correct reply with elm, so I think, that the header is okay.

This mail has the header:
Reply-To: Martin Struwe <struwe@frankfurt.cs.uni-sb.de>, 
          Martin Struwe <in11hfms@rz.uni-sb.de>
When I receive this header, Pine shows to me:
Reply-To: "Martin Struwe <struwe@frankfurt.cs.uni-sb.de>,        Martin
     Struwe" <struwe@frankfurt.cs.uni-sb.de>
Yes, with quotes.  So my reply produces:
To      : "Martin Struwe <struwe@frankfurt.cs.uni-sb.de>,        Martin Struwe"
           <struwe@frankfurt.cs.uni-sb.de>

When I insert quotes, they will be automaticaly removed, so the following
is not working:
Reply-To: "Martin Struwe" <struwe@frankfurt.cs.uni-sb.de>,
          "Martin Struwe" <in11hfms@rz.uni-sb.de>

Even
Reply-To: in11hfms@rz.uni-sb.de, struwe@cs.uni-sb.de
expands to
To      : in11hfms@rz.uni-sb.de

I've wrote a msg with elm:
Reply-To: struwe@cs.uni-sb.de (Martin Struwe), in11hfms@rz.uni-sb.de (Martin Struwe)
Pine says, the header is:
Reply-To: struwe@cs.uni-sb.de, Martin Struwe <in11hfms@rz.uni-sb.de>
and my replay expands to:
To      : Martin Struwe <in11hfms@rz.uni-sb.de>

With Pine3.91 it works correctly.  But elm, pine3.94 and pine3.91 are on
different systems, and maybe the admins did a mistake.

	can you reply to my header?  Martin.

Check the permissions on your home directory files -- are they
readable or writable by others?  Assuming a Unix-type system.

Talk to your sysadmin--there may be backups available made at an
earlier date.  And maybe your sysadmin is running some programs to
move old mail to another file to save space.

Is Pine fit to be used as a restricted-shell mailer under UNIX?
Meaning, can it be configured to provide a 'secure' environment in which
no external programs or files can be started or viewed?

Any other mailer that might be eligible?  Elm?

    Sorry, but you need to supply MUCH more technical information
before anyone can realistically offer you some assistance.  What
version of Pine are you using?  What kind of computer system is Pine
running on?  What operating system?  What version?  What kind of
computer is your "C:" drive on?  What operating system (and version) 
is it running?  What telecommunications software are you using between
your computer and the one Pine is running one?  What file transfer
protocols are available on each computer?

    It may not actually be necessary to know the answers to every one
of these questions, but we have to know a *little* more about your
setup before we can help you, because there are simply too many
combinations out there to make a blanket answer to your question.  
If you are at an educational institution or purchasing access from a
commercial provider, there may be some sort of help desk or information
center who can help you faster.  Regrettably, many new users want to
know "How do I do X" without realizing that sometimes, like it or not,
a minimum of background technical information is necessary before the
question can be answered.

    Does this mean that ISO-8859-1 8-bit letters are forbidden in the
Subject: line?  I participate in some language-oriented mailings lists
in which Latin-1 text is not unusual.

I used the pine for the past 6 months without problems, it occurred on the

I find three actions are required to to cause the SIGHUP.
1. Bounce a message
2. Move in the message index with the arrow keys
3. Select a message.

If possible, turn the "smart quotes" option off in the preferences for
the text editor (e.g. MS Word) that you use. That should solve the
problem. Smart quotes are not supported in regular ASCII text that
commonly flows over the internet.

I retrieved the pine distribution from ftp.celestial.com and it seems to 
be working fine. However, I cannot find a binary distribution of a 
current version of sendmail, nor will the "mkdev cf" configuration file 
work properly. Does someone have a compiled version of sendmail and a 
working .cf file that they would be willing to send to me? Thanks!

Please respond directly as I am not a member of the list.

I've read the documentation.  I've studied the configuration
setup.

The problem:  When I post a message to a newsgroup my posting has in the
From field the following (for example)

	To:alt.test

Not my name, my personal name, nor my id (like everyone else's).

This must be a simple configuration problem, but 2 hours of exploration
hasn't revealed the answer to me.

Please e-mail me at ljwelch@access.digex.net with any solution.

Thanks in advance!!

    I do not have a specific example readily to hand, but from time to
time I have received emails in which the date header has been mashed,
sometimes so much so that I could hardly figure out what it was.  The
date header does not seem to be critical to message transmission, so
the message shows up OK.

    However, when Pine is trying to sort by date (if told to do so), it
has a garbled field to deal with which it cannot sort correctly simply
because the date field is not correct itself, and Pine is not psychic
to figure out what the sender intended.  In my experience, messages
with garbled date fields tended to wind up at the top of the list. 
Also, there is the problem that some mailers may send out a date in the
format '14 Jul 1996' and others in the format '14 Jul 96', the same
date in two different formats which Pine has to deal with
mechanistically.

    If you have a World Wide Web browser, browse my home page and
follow the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  She has plenty of
information on mail filtering with Pine.  

    (This may be one of the most repetitive questions on this
newsgroup.  I wish we could get it into an FAQ somewhere that
people could actually learn about and read.)

I have a somewhat similar setup (except that I rarely login to my
machine as root)...

You can tell Pine to add a "Reply-to:" header with the "custom
headers" option.

I was going to recommend using sendmail's userdb feature (with which
you can give a useer a "mailname", and mail from that user goes out
with the mailname address), but then I remembered pine's stubbornness
about handing unqualified addresses to sendmail... if pine would just
accept that my sendmail will qualify the address, I would use it a lot
more (instead of elm).

Setup a script as below, and use a cron to set it off regularly.

#!/bin/sh
popclient -3 -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD -c MAILSERVER >> /var/spool/mail/USERNAME

A friend just showed me how this works, so Kudos to him not me ;)

Hiya all, my situation is thus:

I run pine on my machine (on a dynamic PPP link to my ISP), and have a 
script use popclient to grab my mail for me, and download it into pine's 
INBOX locally. Is there anyway that I can have messages I send have a 
'reply-to' field so that responses would be directed to neddy@itl.net 
rather than root@insanity.itl.net?

Please post any responses and/or cc: them to neddy@itl.net


Regards,

When viewing the Index of a folder, I would like to be able to see the
value in the "Sender:" field instead of the "From:" field, in cases when
they differ. This usually (only ?) happends in mailing lists, where
sometimes it is more interesting for me to see from which lists the
messages arrive than whether the message was sent to the list by John Doe
or anyone else.  This applies to the "sort" ($) function too as well. 

I am using pine 3.9.3 on an AIX 4.1.4 machine  

Any solution/suggestion/future plan?

Date: Mon, 15 Jul 96 18:05:52 GMT
Message-Id: <4se1gb$3rf@news-read-1.PeachNet.EDU>

A two-fold question.

        1) What compiler is needed to compile WinPine.  I only found mention 
of the MS C compiler for the DOS version.  Perhaps more to the point - Can 
Borland C++ (3.1,4.0,4.5,5.0) compile it?

        2) We are going to deploy WinPine in a diskless lab situation.  Are 
there any ways that you can force it only use a remote folder for all 
operations no matter what?

Basically, If I can recompile it, I was gonna to make a few site mods to 
always force it to use the settings we want and a few other things - and also 
write protect the .ini file with default settings.  This forces the student to 
enter their userid and password everytime, but we are trying to get away from 
having a maildrop on the unix box, and a login on the novell system as well.

Any other comments on using it in a similar envrionment would be great.
Thanks!

Set your index-format (in Set-up/Config screens, near the end) to the
following line:

STATUS MSGNO DATE SENDER(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)

This should work according to pine's on-line help; I did not try it.

For the Pine Team: The SENDER token is mentioned in paragraph about FROM,
but not in the list of tokens at the beginning of the on-line  help. Coul=
d
you correct it?

The "saved-messages" are in a file called (unless you changed it)
saved-messages, probably in the mail directory.  You can transfer
this file to your computer in the same way you would transfer any
other file--e.g., use kermit to upload it, do a screen capture on
it, ftp it if you have ftp capability.  If it's on the same computer,
you can just copy it like any other file.

Hope that helps....

I've read several messages in the archives at the University of Washington
site which discuss setting up Pine for random signatures based on drawing
a quote randomly from a file of multiple quotes. There was reference to a
program called sigrnd.tgz which I was unable to find through archie. I
guess this is an old thread but I'd like to reopen it. Looking forward to
your suggestions!

No man page doesn't necessarily mean no program.  
Usually you can type 

  which procmail

to find out what directory it's in.  Other
ways to find procmail on your system are
described in my Filtering Mail FAQ, which
is accessible through:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/

If it's not installed on your system, ask your
sys admin to install it.  If they won't, get
a new ISP - I'm starting a list of "Mega Megabyte
ISPs" at:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/isp/

I'm including info about whether IMAP and procmail
are install.  Additions are welcome!

Thanks,
Nancy

As far as I know RFC 822 (or 821?) requires 7-bit characters in all parts
of messages and RFC 1521 (MIME 1) allows 8-bit characters only in body if
Content-Transfer-Encoding: and appeoprite mail transport mechanism
(8BITMIME ESMTP extension) is used. 8-bit characxters in headers (for
example in Subject:) thus have to be encoded into seven bits as described
in RFC 1522 (MIME, part 2). The result you can see in my From: line (in
pine you have to use full header mode to see it).

This happens when Pine is unable to update your .pinerc file with the
date this question was last asked.  Check to make sure the file
permissions are correct and that you have enough dis/quota space for
Pine to make a copy of your .pinerc file...

Subject: mailbox locking for Solaris

Pine/imapd won't work at Rutgers without some modifications.  While
our mailbox configuration is somewhat non-standard, normal Sun mail
software will work without changes.  Thus I claim that you have a bug.
Fortunately for you, I have a fix. 

Here's the issue: Sun normally uses both methods of locking: they use
both kernel locking and lock files.  So does pine and imapd.  However
Sun's mail software all runs setgid to mail.  Pine does not.  Because
their software runs setgid, we are able to protect /var/mail so that
normal users can't create files in it.  This protects us from the
symlink attack.  (It is possible to defend yourself against that
attack to some extent by testing whether a symlink exists.  However
that code has race conditions in it.) Because pine doesn't run setgid,
it can't create lock files on our systems.  That causes a big problem
for us, because we disable kernel locking.  We do this because of the
long history of problems with lockd. 

Anyway, I claim that pine needs two changes:
 - it needs to be able to run setgid mail to create lock files
 - it should be possible to disable kernel locking in a configuration
	file for pine and an option for imap

I want to be able to control kernel locking at runtime because I want
to be able to use a single binary throughout Rutgers.  Some Rutgers
hosts use normal Sun conventions.  For them kernel locking should be
on.  The larger systems want to disable it.  Since locking is
controlled at runtime, this should be easy.  The mechanism is already
there: you just need to add it to the list of things that can be in
the config file (presumably config.fixed), and add an option for imap. 

Creating lock files is more complex.  Pine does too many "system" and
"fork/exec" calls for me to feel safe in simply running it setgid
mail.  Instead, the approach I've taken is to create a small helper
program to lock and unlock mail files: /usr/local/lib/maillock.  This
helper program runs setgid.  Thus the modifications to c-client are to
check which file is being locked, and call the helper program when
it's the user's mail file. 

Enclosed you'll find two things: diffs to c-client to call maillock,
and maillock itself.  This code has been tested under Solaris 2.4
(gso) and Digital Unix 3.2c and 4.0 (osf).  Maillock is based on our
copy of Berkeley Mail.  I thought it was free, but I have a suspicion
that this particular file may actually have gone through ATT.  It
might be safer to go to a version from freebsd or some other public
source.  If you take these changes I'll get you a version of maillock
that I know is unencumbered.

I've just installed Pine 3.95 and I have a suggestion. In your
documentation you should talk about how to install upgrades. I've just
spent a frustrating hour trying to get my addressbook to be seen by the
new version of pine. I had backed up the 3.94 version and finally just
copied the new version of the .exe over the old version. Now the
addressbook works fine. Is this how we are supposed to do it? 

Also, like a broken record, I am requesting the standard Windows interface
of the keyboard commands of Ctrl-C (copy) Ctrl-v (paste), etc. 

Thanks.

| Is there a feature or option to make this happen?

In 3.94, it's easy enough typing ^J (Justify) and it will automatically 
insert the "reply-indent-string" at the beginning of each quoted line. In 
3.91, you would have to do it manually.

*When* is someone gonna make the Pine FAQ? This is the one question that
has appeared at least 10 times the last week only.

Filtering is not done by Pine at all. I recommend using 'procmail' or
'filter' (filter is from the elm-package) for that purpose.

Two places where the Pine FAQs (*which are currently undergoing revision*) 
can be accessed are: 

1.) On the World Wide Web at the URL:
	http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/
    (The question "How can I filter messages into different incoming
     folders?" is covered at URL:
	http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/02/msg00002.html)

2.) On the anonymous FTP host 
	ftp.cac.washington.edu 
    in the subdirectory
	/pine/docs/faq/

Andrea,

You can currently access the FAQ files in that location (which is at the
University of Washington) using Pine by defining a folder collection in
Pine as: 

*{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/faq/[]

-- or with a WWW browser at the URL:
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/faq/

Besides the FAQ collection, additional supplemental Pine documentation can
be accessed through the "Pine Information Center" on the World Wide Web at
the URL

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/

Pine supports "distribution lists", look at the Addressbook-option of the
main menu.. (You need to create a distribution list, nicknamed as ab, and
add alice and bob to it..)

Subject: HELP w/ Pine (3.91) Mailing Lists
Date: 17 Jul 1996 12:51:56 -0400
Message-Id: <4sj5nc$doc@panix.com>

	I would greatly appreciate it if some experienced Pine user or 
administrator could help me.  I use Pine 3.91

	I run a small business primarily via e-mail.  First, I create a
list of customers' e-mail addresses under a heading (I believe you call
this an "address book").  Some of these lists are short, others run to
several hundred e-mail addresses.  I then create a catalog of my products,
send a copy to myself & then Bcc the appropriate mailing list (address
book).  I send the catalog as text w/in the e-mail, not as an attached file.
(BTW, I only send to those who request it).

	Here are my questions:
	1) I already have some customers listed in an account w/ a
different provider using Pegasus mail.  Is there any way I can transfer
these e-mail addresses to Pine w/o retyping all the names?  I can save the
names in a text file using WordPerfect.  Can I upload them to Pine's
address book?
	2) Is there a limit to how many addresses I can have in an 
address book?  Will the number of addresses in an address book in any way 
impede or affect the flow of e-mail to all recipients?  Note that I don't 
mind breaking down the mailing lists into smaller lists.
	3) Is there a way to organize (preferably alphabetically) the 
e-mail addresses in the various address books?
	4) When someone writes to me requesting my products, can I take
his/her address & automatically add it to the specific address book or do
I have to retype it by hand?
	5) Is there a way to save (or print) the e-mail addresses so that 
I can have a back-up copy?
	6) Finally, I recently Bcc'd a short note to several hundred 
people on my mailing list.  They all seemed to get it.  However, when I 
sent a long e-mail (about 40K), people didn't get it.  Is there a problem 
w/ sending this much text in the body of the e-mail?

	Thanks very much in advance for your time & effort.  Feel free to
e-mail me directly or phone if you'd prefer.

Subject: Rich Header "Default" Available?
Date: 17 Jul 1996 20:42:50 -0500
Message-Id: <4sk4qq$rpa@www.gnofn.org>

Hi,

Was just wondering...Is there a way that I can reconfigure Pine so that a 
"rich header" will appear each time I select 'c' (Compose) instead of 
having to press Ctrl-R each time?

Any suggestions would be most appreciated!

Thank you,

Brian J. Barbazon

I think it was a bug in Pine 3.91.  Pine follows (or tries to) the
IMAP definition that there is only one INBOX, and it is not case
sensitive.

Base64 is the MIME way of coding files, almost any sufficient mail program
can undecode it. (There are also some programs capable of decoding this,
mostly for UNIX..) But it also _can_ be uucoded, so you might also try
uudecode ..

Modify the Default-headers -option in the setup..

The following answers are based on the current Pine 3.95 release. 
Some do not apply to Pine 3.91...

Send yourself a message with the list of addresses in the body of the
message.  Read the message with Pine and use the TakeAddr function.

No.

Some versions of sendmail have bugs that are triggered by large lists
and there can be some delays in passing off long lists to sendmail. 
If the delays are a problem, take a look at the
enable-background-sending feature in the Setup/Config screen.

There is an addrbook-sort-rule in the Setup/Config screen to handle
this.

Use the TakeAddr function.

Yes, you can print the addressbook.

There is no Pine limitation, but there could be limitations in mail
transports or gateways that you are running into.  Check with your
system administrator for assistance.

    Please reply directly to:
dw@freenet.npiec.on.ca
    and the news group if you wish.

With Pine 3.93, Regarding:
  1) Undesired email from a know address

Can a filter be installed in PINE 3.39 BEFORE email
arrives ?  An end user customizable filter.
    OR
Is there an add-on program that works with PINE 3.93
that will achieve this?

For example, accept all email
    *.*

EXCEPT from the following addresses:
    abc123@host.domain.io
    def456@host.domain.io
    ....

This filter would not allow any undesired email:
The sender would get this kind of response ...


Mail not sent: <target@host.domain.io>... User unknown



or this kind of message ...


   ----- The following addresses had delivery problems -----
<target@host.domain.io>  (unrecoverable error)

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
550 <target@host.domain.io>... Host unknown
 (Name server: host.domain.io: host not found)



Thanks in advance for any help.
Cheers!

Uuuuh, so each time there's a new release we'd have to do that in order to
change From: ? Surely, there must be a better way to make us all happy!

I could live with a general system default setup for pine in which such
things could be defined. In that way the simple users wouldn't be able to
change From: if the admin doesn't want them to.

The DOS versions of Pine are becoming increasingly unusable. 

This is not a grumble, or a request for a bug fix, but a statement of
fact. Both the packet driver version of Pine 3.91 on desk top machines
and the LWP version of Pine 3.91 on our Novell lab network were just
usable in our environment, though there were quite a large number of
complaints because Pine tended to abort when faced with composing large
messages (it ran out of memory below 640).

The DOS versions of Pine 3.95, so far as I can see, are more or less
unusable. I have cleared out my below 640K to leave about 556K (the
necessary DOS stuff and TCPIP stack is taking up most of that the 90K
used). I can start Pine up, and read messages, but any attempt to
compose blows Pine out of the water after it copes with the To: line (ie
step 1!). 

(I'm OK, because I use OS/2 and can use either the OS/2 port or the
Windows port.)

I wonder in what environment the development team test it?

The purpose of this posting is to suggest one of three options as the
forward looking strategy:

a) To remove support for the pure DOS versions; thus from Pine 3.96 (or
maybe Pine 4.00) on there would be no DOS versions. 

b) Invest the effort in proper use of extended memory

c) Have a "lite" compile option which leaves out a number of advanced
features (newsgroups, for example) to cut down the compiled size of the
DOS versions so that the basic facilities could still be used.

(Assuming you are referring to PC versions and not unix?)
That is one way. Another is to have the address book in \PINE and the
program elsewhere, and to call the program by explicit path
eg c:\my\pine\program\pine.exe. A third way is to have the location of
the addressbook explicitly specified in pinerc (the places where pine
looks for data files such as addressbook in the absence of an explicit
setting is well explained in the Help information (release notes if I
remember rightly).

This would then make Windows pine very different to over other Pine
where cntl-C means Cancel, which would seem to be to be a big
disadvantage.

Why not standardise on the Windows conventions in all versions of Pine?
 
It would be interesting to see how Pine's use splits between platforms - I
use both PC and unix, but find the Windows version FAR more user friendly
in terms of using a mouse, cutting and pasting within and in/out of Pine
(notwithstanding the mooted standardisation) and correcting typos! But
then I come from a PC environment - not a mainframe one. 

It would be nice to see more buttons on the toolbar and also use of the
right mouse button too.  This would give it a more coherent feel for new
users I feel sure.

I've set up pine to filter messages from various lists to certain
folders without any problems but for some reason, my default inbox
got messed up. I set the default to point to ~/EMERGENCY_MBX which
works but is obviously incorrect. Any ideas?

Thanks

I can just hear the unix users howls now! They are so used to cntl-C
being cancel system-wide.

I do mot think it is possible to produce compatible unix-sympathetic and
Windows-sympathetic strategies (and unix came first!).

There is a configuration opption where you can tell pine all the
possible addresses you might be known by, just so that this won't
happen.

Greetings from San Antonio. I believe you need to go to alt-addresses in
the set-up configure screen (2nd to the last page) 

"This option provides a place for you to list alternative e-mail addresses
 you may have. If set, the option affects the behavior of the Reply 
 command and the "+" symbol in the Folder Index, which denotes that a
 message has been addressed specifically to you.
 With respect to Reply, the reply-to-all option will exclude addresses 
 listed here."

I hope I'm right and that this answers your question.

Good Luck.....Andrea

I have set up filter and have 'lost' a few messages. They save to the
folders ok, but the copy does not go to my mailbox, despite the log
saying it did. Is this the 'file locking' problem I keep hearing about?
If so, what do I need to do?

Thanks,

Thank you very much.  It is "alt-addresses" and works exactly as
advertised.

I can't get PC-Pine to attach files from directories with special "95ish"
characteristics, such as spaces in the names. When attempted, it always
complains that their is a "Problem with the attachment". 

For example, if my doc is in C:\My Documents, the attach will fail. 
(sound familiar?  This is the location all Office 95 apps want to dump
your creations!)

Is there any workaround or fix for this problem?

Thanks

I need to cancel a news posting.  I on Netscape but don't believe it's version

What exactly is Pine?  Do I need to purchase it?

Your help would be appreciated.

I never thought I would see the day that PINE would take down my solaris
server but 3.95 has done it twice. I don't know what causes it just yet,
but the process just starts eating up CPU time until the system
grinds to a halt. Has anyone else experienced this or heard about this problem
and hopefully a workaround?

Perhaps try enclosing the filename with quotation marks? (Just a

This is a very good description of the problem.  For several decades,
"Garbage In - Garbage Out" has been a mantra among programmers.  What may
seem very obvious to humans is not necessarily obvious to programs.

Pine 3.95 has some significant improvements in this area.

Pine should handle this correctly.

You should propably use the short name of the directory, if I remember
correctly (hey, haven't used windows95 for months!), the file
c:\mydocu~1\file.doc is equal to c:\my documents\file.doc .. =)

The dir-command should print out also the short names of directories..

Hi,
I'm running pine 3.91 in an xterm window on an AIX machine via

  xterm -geometry 80x35-0+0 -fg Black -cr Black -bg White -e pine &

in my xinitrc.
Somtimes using the (C)ompose key does not refresh the screen, so that
the previous screen and the edited message get completely mixed up.

Has anyone else had this problem ? And solved it ?

Any hints welcome, thanks.

Is there something like an imapclient similar to popclient? The reason
I am asking is the following: I would like to retrieve mail for
offline reading at home not from the INBOX, but from some other mail
folders, where presorted private mail ends up. My "ISP" is my
workstation at the office and I want most of my mail to stay there.

Such a thing should be relatively easy to write with the c-client
library, and maybe somebody has done it already.

I have also thought about using pine to do this by invoking it with
{my.office.machine}my/private/mailfolder as initial folder and with
the appropriate initial keystrokes to save everything locally, expunge
and exit. But I don't know whether pine will work without a terminal
and I don't know how to supply the password when I do this unattended
from cron.

Pop2 supports folders. Pop3 doesn't.

Hi-

I get a core dump when I attempt to retrieve a blank entry in my address
book.  The entry appeared only to have a full name and nickname from the
address book index.  If I highlight it, then press return, pine aborts and
leaves me a 1 meg core in my home directory.  I've since deleted the
entry.

Just thought you might like to know.

I'm compiling Pine 3.95 on AIX 4.2.  I had tried before on Pine 3.94, came
up with an error which i emailed in about.  I was told that the new version
would fix it, but it did not...
the error i get when building with a32 is in send.c, line 2905...
something about setpgid...
Is that the correct command?  i was thinking it should be like setgid or 
something...

anyone?

Subject: Transient problems with pine
Date: 19 Jul 1996 19:17:26 GMT
Message-Id: <4son06$21d@masala.cc.uh.edu>

I have recently decided to connect my Linux box to my shell account 
at my university using slirp (yes I know a ppp emulator is not very
clean). I'm using Linux 1.2.13 and pine 3.91. When I'm not connected
I'm using a simple localhost setup with no entries in /etc/resolv.conf
and just the name of the host in /etc/HOSTNAME and /etc/hosts. And 
everything works fine. When I set it up for a connection, I add the 
domain name to the host name in /etc/hosts in the format of 
testing.unimachine.edu. I add the domain to the to the /etc/resolv.conf 
along with the addresses of three of our name servers. Then I reboot the
machine. Now without establishing the ppp connection yet. Pine chokes
on any mail sent locally with addresses set with the hostname of the machine
but will deliver them if you type in localhost instead of the hostname.
Elm 2.4 and mail 5.5 don't seem to have this problem. So, my question is what
is pine trying to do? Is it sending the mail by checking with the name
servers first? The error I get is "transient problems" and mail get bounced
to root... I'm pretty sure I followed most of the howtos explicitly but 
not to idiocy. I never did connect as this has eaten up too much of my 
time and the connect scripts are getting hung by some characters sent by the
servers... something I'll fiddle with later. But I'm curious as I don't 
have the documentation to pine at hand. Setting pine to maximum debug seemed
to get the same error message. I hope I included enough information
rather than say "I have a problem...".

Subject: Removing Duplicate Addresses in Compose
Date: 18 Jul 1996 11:43:45 -0400
Message-Id: <4slm3h$l0e@blackcomb.nlm.nih.gov>

Duplicate addresses in the To: field of the Compose window have been a
thorn in my side ever since I can remember. Pine was finally fixed a
few releases ago to at least not generate an error when it detected
duplicate addresses. But I'd like it to _remove_ the duplicate
addresses altogether! My other mail program (Sun Mailtool) does this
just fine. Why can't Pine?

If you can't remove the duplicates automatically, could you at least
give me a key sequence I can enter in the Compose window to remove
duplicates?

Just to make sure we are reading from the same page, if I have
the following distribution lists

	foo		foo		(foo@foo.com, me@me.com)
	bar		bar		(bar@bar.com, me@me.com)
   foobar 	foobar	(foo, bar)

and I send mail to "foobar", it expands to

	To: foobar -- foo <foo@foo.com>, 
   	me <me@me.com>, 
   	bar <bar@bar.com>, 
   	me <me@me.com>

Why can't Pine remove the extra "me@me.com"? Could I at least
be provided with a single command to do it manually? (And I don't
mean the ^K command. :-)

Thanks so much. -Leif Neve

Hi,
is it possible to use a mouse in pico outside pine? I like the option to
move with mouseclic inside pine, and I like pico as my std editor for
posting. So I would like to use the mouse although in tin, cause I don't
like to post with pine.
Any way to realize that?
So short,

To anybody that might have an answer:

Is there any "slick" way of using pine with PGP?  That is, is there a way
of piping messages through PGP before sending them on their way?  And
vice-versa for incoming mail?  

Thanks for any replies!

	I second that!  I installed PC-pine thinking that it will support POP3
and save my messages in mailx format instead of some proprietary
format (like MS Exchange).  I was a bit disappointed to find out that
it didn't support POP3.

When I use the JUSTIFY-command for quoted text, it goes well, ie:

> word1
> word2
> word3

becomes to:

> word1 word2 word3

But when using the justify-command for multiple times quoted text, ie:

> > > word1

> > > word3

It doesn't become out so well..


So: I would suggest, that the text in previous example could be justified
as:

> > > word1 word2 word3

(Or perhaps even to: >>> word1 word2 word3 )

Hi,

I'm trying to build Pine 3.94 in Solaris/SunOS 5.5, and encounter lots of 
errors.
The command I'm using is "build sun".

Does anybody here have similar experiences?

Best Regards,

Robert

Hi, 

I use Pine at school and here, on Intac. At school, Pine works nicely. 
The unix command "mail" shows me all my new mail until I get into pine,
after which point, mail no longer shows me those letters. I noticed that
here, when I exit pine and type the unix command "mail," it 
continues to show me the entire contents of my inbox.

How can I make Pine hide my mail from the unix "mail" command once I've
read it? 

Thanks...
Mike Rusignola

Hello:

Try "build sol" (if using the sun CC compiler), or "build gso" if using
gcc.

SunOS verions 4.XX and below are vintage "SunOS", i.e.  more or less
Berkeley-like Unix, while 5.XX are System V Release 4 (AT&T SVR4), which
sun calls Solaris.  To make things more confusing, sun numbers its Solaris 
versions differently - so, e.g. Solaris 2.5 = SunOS 5.5 .

Thus, the "build sun" build script is intended for SunOS 4.XX .

I hope you find this helpful.

yes.  and when the addresses are long enough, pine puts every entry in a

Hi.

I just downoaded and compiled pine3.95.  I'm still having the problem
I reported several weeks ago -- it has been characteristic of all
versions since 3.92.  When I'm running on the inn server machine --
going through imapd or not -- and I try to post to a newsgroup I get the
following error message:

[Error posting message:441 435 Bad Message-ID]

This does not occur with 3.91 or with later versions when the access
is remote.

I'm running Linux 1.3.60, gcc 2.7.2.

I have no idea whether it's related, but during the link step for
several of the programs, the following error message is generated:

bfd assertion fail /opt/release/pub/bin/binutils/bfd/elfcode.h:4716
bfd assertion fail /opt/release/pub/bin/binutils/bfd/elf32-i386.c:624

find - doesn't find these files on my system.

Is this a problem or THE problem or unimportant???

Any clues?? -- I'd like to bring all my pines up to current release.
If you need any other system details I'd be glad to respond.

Thanks.

I use a shell script to randomize my signature with fortune every few 
minutes.  You could also get a copy of a program like Marvin if you want 
to use your own lines to randomize your sigs.

-----script I use-------

#!/bin/sh

Hi There

Does anybody know a way to allow users to create a .forward file from
within pine (something like the way they can create a .signature file)?

Thanks,

     Donal

    I have encountered this from time to time.  I really don't know
what is happening within Pine under the covers, but it always seems to
be related (at least in my case) to newsserver problems which Pine has
no control over.  Once the newsserver recovers, Pine is happy again. 
(On rare occasions I have had to exit and re-enter Pine to re-establish
the connection.)

Yeah, I also really like the ability to requote the text by JUSITY and I
also would like to see enchancements in it. If example if the document has
been already quoted using "> " and then when I try reply it it is also
additonally quoted by "->". The final result of trying to apply the Ctrl-J
is pretty disappointing.. perhaps the the justify funtion should look what
the reply-indent-string is setup to to determine what the nonstandard
quote might look like.

Thanks,
Adam

  Due to special reasons (old gateway to other mail system) we send mail
to different persons using the same username@hostname address. The gateway
uses "Comment" field to deliver mail to right person, for example the
addresses

"Alex Kogan"  <gatewayid@gatewayhost.domain>

and 

"Mike Smith" <gatewayid@gatewayhost.domain>

are different. 

When there are several addresses in such form in received message
pine 3.94 includes ONLY ONE of them during Reply-to-All !!!

Pine 3.91 correctly includes all of them during Reply-To-All.

How can we solve this problem ? 

Pine 3.94 has many advantages, but this problem is very serious in our
environment.

	Sure....

	If you have the | "pipe" command enabled you can always use
pipe any message to the following:

	echo "newwadr@foo.bar.com" > $HOME/.forward

	Normally the body of the message is used...but in this case it is
disgarded.

This assumes your mail administrator has not setup your mail configuration
file such that mail forwards are handled out of a central location (i.e.
/var/forward). Many installation look there first, and then MAYBE at the
/home/.forward file.

Well, here's a guess.  In your .pinerc, check for the news-collections
section.  You should be able to setup a list of news servers, and pick
one from the List Folders screen.  This is just a guess, as I haven't
tried it myself.

Hello,

I have installed both 3.92 and 3.94 hoping to be able to use PINE on my
system.  However, it is very unstable here.

Both versions will retrieve the mail and allow me to read a bit of it then
PINE crashes.

After the timeout period when PINE tries to check mail again I see "INBOX
Closed, error in accessing"  or words to that effect.

Sometimes when replying I get the same error.

CTL-L simply crashes with no explaination instead of refreshing the inbox.

Reading newsgroups seems to retrieve all headers each time I open a group.  It
never seems to want to "catch-up" with articles either.

As I have seen many post using PINE from OS/2, I'd like to ask for some (lots)
of assistance getting it to run properly here.

Thanks for your time.
Gary

	If you have not defined it in the .pinerc file, then it is using
the "local host".  i.e. the one pine is running on.  Of course, this 
assumes Unix pine.  With PC pine you *must* set an SMTP server.

Sure.  While you're reading the email message in pine type `R'
to reply and then while your cursor is in the headers type
`^R' (`CTRL+R') to view rich headers.  Fill in the Newsgroups
header with whatever news groups you want the message to go to.
Of course you should only post a mail message if you are 
*sure* it's ok with the person who wrote the message!

Have fun,
Nancy

Message-Id: <4suoc3$khv@panix3.panix.com>


  does anybody know of a book or tutorial on Pine for the 
complete novice?

  a few people have asked me "how to do e-mail", and it would
be helpful if there was some handy reference i could show
them. pine is pretty straight forward for computer- 
literate folks, but it can still be confusing for those not 
familiar with the unix environment, let alone computers in 
general.

  what i have in mind is something that includes a lot of screen
shots and detailed examples and explanations of what happens when
you press a key.

  i've browsed a couple of beginner's internet books, but i 
didn't find anything that dealt in-depth with using pine.

  thanks in advance.

I am having all kinds of trouble installing pine so that the arrow keys 
will work.  During the installation, the only question I was asked is 
what OS I am running (DG/UX).  I imagine it must have something to do 
with the emulation (Wyse60), but I don't know how or where to correct it. 
 Can anyone offer some suggestions?  PLEASE!

In my last post, I mentioned that I wanted to use filters to display
an HTML file sent to me via email using lynx.  The response I got was
to place text/html in my mailcap file.  The problem with this is I
want to be able to display an HTML file that is simply emailed as text
to me. mailcap doesn't see it when it is ascii/plain.

How can I make the filters work?  (see previous post for what  have
already tried)

I still can't understand why Pine can't word wrap the reply already done
when we enter Pico - which then properly would support all kinds of 3rd
party editors.

I would further like to see a way to specify the "quote prefix" appended
to all lines. It should of course be able to use parts of the From:
field.

Said before: I have a word wrap filter that works a *lot* better than the
one Pine uses when we press control-j. If such a one can't' be used
internally in Pine, I sure would like a config way to specify my filter
program to do the wrap and quote-prefix-appending before inserted in the
reply editing editor.

Of course I'd offer that little program to anyone if that feature was
added to Pine.

Following-up here, I come back to a posting of mine a few weeks ago.  This 
justifying unfortunately works only as long as one is in the REPLY mode of
the internal editor.  If I postpone a reply, and continue it later, the 
editor is NOT in reply mode.  Two things happen then:  The Ctrl-J does not 
work for quoted text at all anymore, above example results in:

> word1 > word2 > word3

and, which is not so annoying, the mail I replied to, does not get the "A" 
flag for an answered mail.  I understand that this flag is difficult to 
get in this case, but one should be able to send the editor manually into
REPLY mode, by a certain key combination.

This would also be useful when editing text while forwarding mail, if the 
forwarded text includes quoted parts.

Comments?  What do the developers think?

    I have been using Pine for quite some time now with high
satisfaction.  I use procmail to take case of my mail filtering needs. 
However, the lack of filtering/killfile tools for newsgroups has become
a bit of a problem.

    A serious sci.* newsgroup I follow has gotten caught in a
crossposting war which has now become a flaming crossposting war, all
because some careless or thoughtless people started some threads and
crossposted them irresponsibly to various marginally relevant or
irrelevant groups.  The result is that the sci.* group I follow is
getting swarmed under by irrelevant postings, some of them verging on
the malicious.  Pine's lack of killfile capability makes sorting
through the trash to find the "real" postings a chore.

    I am wondering if anyone has come up with a way around this sort of
thing (other than switching to a different reader with killfiles)? 
About all I can think of is something like a Perl or Python script
which would scan a killfile list, examine the unread postings in that
newsgroup, and massage .newsrc, although that doesn't seem like a very
clean way of doing things, and I myself am not in a position to write
such a script.  Anybody got any ideas?  Thanks.

Hi,

We recently got switched to Pine 3.94 and I wish to use Pine to read
news as well instead of running Trn.  I have gone thru the FAQ and other
docs trying to find if it is possible to set Pine for threaded news
reading, but nothing have turned up.  So is it possible?

Tx,

Very good point!

But there's also need for doing the justification later, e.g. after deleting
some sentences from the quoted text, one could re-justify the stuff...

But it would alredy be of great advantage to run the justification before
entring the editor in a reply!!!

All the best,

in 3.95 unix, I can say in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf

standard-printer=lpr -Pthis, lpr -Pthat, lpr -Pother

in order to offer three printers. So far so good. Now,
the setup printer screen looks (in part) like this
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Standard UNIX print command
      Using this option may require setting your "PRINTER" or "LPDEST"
      environment variable using the standard UNIX utilities.

The syntax is:

	standard-printer=<entry>[, <entry> ...]

(where the "[" and "...]" are not actually typed but merely used here to
represent possible repetition)

where an <entry> is:

	Descriptive name [] command string

(this time the "[]" really *is* entered).

I found this by the simple expedient of adding a custom (personal) ptimy
command using the Setup Printer screen, looking at what it had put in the
.pinerc file, and then assuming the format was the same for the standard
printer.

It's probably documented somewhere or other too (but I thought it was
easier to do it my way).

Hi,

Amoung other things I use pine to read internet news. The only problem I
have is that I can not post news. When I select compose news while running
pine I get a new screen but the whole thing is locked up. The only way I
can get out of it is to switch screens and kill the process running pine.

What is really strange is I can reply to news articles with out a
problem.

Anyone else experiance this problem?

Thanks for any help that you might render,

William

	3.90 is rather old.  It would be best to move to 3.94 and try
to duplicate the problem.  BTW, you should also indicate the platform
you are using.

At the risk of seeming pedantic, it is a bit more complicated than that.
The OS IS SunOS 4.x or SunOS 5.x.  Solaris is a combination of a given
release of SunOS with OpenWindows appropriate to that OS.  An appropriate
version of OW is 2 numbers less than the SunOS version, so Solaris 2.5
includes SunOS 5.5 and OW 3.5.  Since I converted to Solaris when it was
2.1, I have not kept all the subtleties of Solaris 1.x straight, but I think
the rules declare that Solaris 1.1 consists of SunOS 4.3.1 with OW 2.3.1 and
Solaris 1.2 is SunOS 4.4 with OW 2.4.

 >Thus, the "build sun" build script is intended for SunOS 4.XX .

We have a mail server (RedHat Linux 3.0.3) running imapd.  When 
the server is accessed via imapd by a user running pine (with
"inbox-path={<server>}inbox" in ~/.pinerc), pine reports 
"Error creating /var/spool/mail/<user>.lock.xxx: Permission denied". 

In the RedHat distribution, /var/spool/mail is writeable only by user
(root) and group (mail), and files within this directory are created with
group mail.  However /usr/sbin/imapd has owner root and group root.

Changing imapd to make it sgid to mail eliminates the error message from 
the imap client (remote pine program).  Is this a reasonable/safe solution?

The problem in a nutshell: when I look at a folder index, some messages
have bad dates, something like this:

	+    9 xxx -1 Joe Blow     (711) Re: can't parse the date

What I know at this point: the reason pine can't parse the date out of the
message is (or seems to be) that there is no "Date:" line in the message.
In other messages there is a line something like:

	Date: Thu, 18 Jul 1996 08:20:08 -0700 (PDT)

but not in the messages that pine can't parse.  Also, all these messages
come from PC's hooked to our Unix box with TCP/IP.  (They use Pronto
mail.  Sorry.)

Am I right that it's the mail server's responsibility to date and time
stamp a message?  If so, why is our mail server not stamping the mail from
our PC's?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I don't know how to program well enough to write such a program (although
I would like to learn how). If you can post the source code for yours,
along with basic explanations, I'd be willing to give it a go from there.

It's the sending program's responsibility -- the mail server doesn't
know when the message was originally sent, only when it received the
message.  But I think the mail server should add it if there isn't one
already.  (I think Sendmail usually does.)

It is not matter of Pine, but of your shell. Examine your $MAIL setting -
it should point to your mailbox. It is usually being set in $HOME/.profile
or /etc/profile.

This is a bug in RedHat.  It is caused by well-intentioned, but naive,
individuals who feel that there is more "security" by giving every email
program privileges than there is by making their /var/spool/mail work in a
secure fashion without privileges.

imapd logs itself in as the indicated user.

No, it is not at all reasonable or safe to add to the number of programs
which run with privileges.  Nor is it reasonable to require that mail
programs run with privileges, thus leaving users hostage to system
managers for their email software. 

The reasonable and safe thing to do is to make the mail spool work
without requiring privileged programs.  That is:

1) Protect /var/spool/mail 1777 -- world read/write with the sticky bit.

2) Make sure that every user has a mail file owned by the user and
   protected 600.

3) Make sure that your mail delivery program (typically /bin/mail) will
   not deliver to mail files which have links, are symbolic links, or are
   not owned by the intended recipient.  Do system security logging every
   time a violation of one of these rules is discovered.

4) Unless you intend to allow multiple people to read a mailbox, also
   force all mail files to have a protection of 600 in the mail delivery
   program.

    Unfortunately, there is probably no way to make everyone happy in
this matter.  Email on the Internet is still only a 7-bit standard, and
some people want a way to have 8-bit characters transmitted.  Q-P was
one of the ways decided on technically.  Some people, such as yourself,
may dislike it very strongly, but other people, such as me, like it,
because I can display the correct 8-bit letters at my end, translating
them out of Q-P.  (I finally got Sven Guckes' one-line Perl script
working -- thanks, Sven.)  No matter what is done, someone will be
unhappy, and unfortunately, you are one of those who are unhappy about
the decision that was made on sending 8-bit characters.  Sorry.

I have just configured IMAP and PC-PINE 3.95 here . 
Was using Unix Pine till now.

I configured sent-mail as a remote folder at the IMAP server . 
But the Folder shows me only the the first two letters of the folder name
For ex: sent-mail at Unix home directory is shown as "nt-mail" . Always ,
the first two letters are left out !
Pls help !

Hi,

I'm gonna take off for vacations tomorrow and after fiddling around 
two hours with our UNIX machine I give up and ask the gurus:

My setup: Eudora Light 1.5.4 on a Mac which connects to a UNIX box running
Linux 1.2.13. There, I have the option between the standard "mail" and
another program called "pine." I was unable to find out how to set
an auto-reply, let's say a sentence like "I'm out for vacations 'till .."
Any good pointers? Thanks.

Tom

Subject: Pine3.94 Compile Errors on Linux
Date: Sun, 21 Jul 1996 20:20:19 GMT
Message-Id: <4su3np$144@news.metamor.com>

I am trying to compile Pine3.94 on a box running MkLinux 1.2.13.  I am
getting this string of error messages during compilation.  There were
a few suggestions in the pine discussion forum regarding the way that
Linux defines iovec.  I have tried commenting the declartion of struct
iovec out of sys/uio.h, (which is actually what linux/uio.h suggests),
and pretty much every other suggestion that was offered.  This problem
appears to be pretty prevalent with Linux machines so I'm sure that
someone has successfully solved this.  Here are the messages that I am
getting...

This is because neither program is designed to do this job (indeed they
can't!).  In particular they are mail *readers* ... for reading mail AFTER
it has been delivered to you by your mail delivery software (usually
"sendmail" on a UNIX box).

Instead you must persuade this mail delivery software to generate the "I
am away" message.

Most UNIX systems include a program called "vacation" to do this.  This
includes clear instructions on how to set it up and use it: type "man
vacation" to see if it is available on your system.  If not, then ask your

Hi all, Is there a way to sort email and Usenet differently? I would like
to sort Usenet by subject and email by date. I can only seem to choose one
sort pattern for both. Thanks, also let me know if you want some art like
animals below. take care, J.

Don't know when it happened, but now when I go into addressbook the FIRST
time during a PINE session, a message flashes across the status line(?)
(down near the bottom), which says (approx)  addressbook.lu is
invalid, rebuilding.  It does that. Nothing else happens, and my
addressbook seems to work OK. What does that mean? How can I fix it?

I've asked "vnet.net" provider, but they have not been able to help.

Any suggestions?

Subject: Pcpine (Win95) in Lab environment

We would very much like to move PCPine into our campus Win95 labs. This of
course means that we can not store a login in the .pinerc file.  I would
appreciate feedback on dealing with any of the following issues:

1. After logging in initially, PCPine asks for a login and password again to
compose, and again for creating/editing folders.  This doesn't seem to be
the case if the login name is present in the .pinerc file.  How might we
avoid this?  We have considered writing a script to write this into .pinerc
each time they log into the Novell server (same login), but it seems this
could be done by PCPine itself by simply storing it into the .pinerc file
(we use revr dist between each user).

2. The .addressbook that our users have on Pine is in a format readable by
PCPine, but there doesn't seem to be a way to use it unless you copy it
over, which is of little use. 

3. Our users often rely on putting in another user's (on our system) login
on the TO: line and having pine do the user name translation and
automatically entering the user's first and last name.  This would be a
helpful option for PCPine to do the same translation there, and even moreso
to do this with the user's login so as to input the First and Last name in
the .pinerc file.  This would avoid asking the user to enter a FROM: value
every time they compose (which, here, is after they are asked to relogin again).

4. We are aware of the benefits of ACAP once finalized and in use, so I
wonder if this is in the works for PCPine.

    Compose your message outside of Pine with a text editor.  Then
enter Pine and tell it you want to compose a message.  After filling in
the headers, you will be in the area where you would otherwise compose
your message.  Press the key combination ^R (Ctrl-R  Control-R) to 
"include" your meessage.  You will see a prompt asking you for the name
of the file you want to include.  Simply type in the filename you saved
your message under.  (If it is not in the current directory, be sure to
include the full path as well as the filename.)  That is all that is
necessary.  It is not necessary to send it as an attachment.

Yes, we are currently planning to implement ACAP support when the
specification becomes more stable.

Dear Sirs:

I have just downloaded pc-pine. When I try to use it with my windows95 
TCP/IP stack I always get the message : "cannot connect to server". I 
have supplied the necessary configuration information for my SMTP 
server. I didn't find an option in the pine configuration for my mail 
server password. Could that be the reason why pine cannot connect?

Please, help

Can't you just make an executable file pinevi containingL
/usr/bin/vi -c "set nonumber" $1
and then config the alternate editor as pinevi?

I am having the same problems.  I thought it was just a problem with my set-up!
Are there any gurus out there that have solved this one or is it a bug in the OS/2 port?
I am using ver 3.94.

Hi all. This is a query about how to get rid of LONG headers when messages
are being sent to big groups. 

Sorry it's so long, but I have to explain what we are trying to
achieve.

Here at the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind in Melbourne,
Australia, we have about 170 staff divided into six Departments. 

We in the IT Dept have written a script which takes information on staff
name, extension and log in from a foxplus database and automatically
creates a new global pine address book and copies it to all sites every
time the list changes.

The global address book first has an individual listing of each staff
member - we use telephone extension numbers as nicknames and add another
symbol where two or more staff share the same extension (e.g. 455. 455_
445' etc) because pine will not work properly if any nicknames are
duplicated.

Then we create a group for each department with nicknames such as ALL_ADM,
ALL_EMP etc, and finally we create an ALL_RVIB group comprised of the
nicknames of all departments. 

Trouble is, when someone sends a message to all staff the header on the
message is a couple of screens long before the message starts.  This is
particularly annoying for our vision-impaired staff using speech adapters
etc, but we have taught people to use the W whereis command to search for
the word Subject - this works well except where people forget to give
their message a subject!

We have also designed a grep script which will strip out all this garbage
except the name of the sender when messages are printed out.

Can anyone suggest a way we can customize Pine to stop global messages
being preceded by this address garbage? I can think of a couple of kludgy
ways, but can someone suggest something elegant?

A second problem is that when you do create these very long lists you can
sometimes create a group too long for Pine to handle, and the address book
bombs out when you try to use it. 

So far we have gotten around this by creating shorter aliases for sites
e.g. calling our burwood site bwd so the addresses there can appear as
fred@bwd instead of fred@burwood, but we could still run into trouble as
the number of staff with e-mail increases (and since we have had Pine they
are using it with great enthusiasm and numbers are increasing daily!)  

Again I suppose we could kludge this by dividing the Burwood site (which
is one Department) into two or more sub-groups, but again I am looking for
the elegant solution.

Thanks for your patience if you got this far - I look forward to advice
from experienced Pine gurus.

I have dialup SLIP, and I just send all my messages (with pine, elm,
or anything else) offline by letting sendmail queue them up.  Then
when I go online I flush sendmail's queue.  I have sendmail send
everything directed outside my machine to a local SMTP server so that
it doesn't have to try to contact machines all over the world during
the short time that I'm online.

My biggest problem is that pine insists on fully qualifying my return
address, instead of letting sendmail do it.

Try building `a41' instead of `a32'.  Both of the problems I ran into when
I built 3.94 (see message ID 4qpops$srq@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu at AltaVista)
have been fixed in 3.95; it builds without incident on the 4.1 box I have
access to.

I believe there are versions of pine for all UNIX type OSes on
ftp.cac.washington.edu, in something like /pine/unix-bin or
/pine/unix-bin-compressed.

You're not clear in your message whether you get this message when you:

a) Try and start Pine/open a mail folder to read
	or
b) Try to send a message after composing it.

Only the latter makes use of SMTP; the former uses a protocol called
"IMAP".  Thus you must have access to an IMAP server running (usually on
port 143) of one of your mainframe computers (typically the mail server).

The IMAP server software (imapd) is available for a number of computers
from the same place as Pine: ftp.cac.washington.edu.  (Indeed, the imapd
source code is actually included within the Pine source code distribution
kit.)

You can only set up one _default_ sort method, which is then used for all
folder collections and folders.

However you can explicitly sort a folder (mail or News) after opening it
by typing "$" then a method code (eg, "$O" for Ordered Subject).

There was some talk back at Pine 3.91 that per-collection or per-folder
default sorting methods might be included in the future, but they haven't
appeared so far.

Personally I think that per-folder sorting methods might be more complex
than its value.  I find that on the whole I want "A" (arrival) sorting for
folders in ordinary collections, but "O" (ordered subject) for Usenet News
collections.  (Remember that it isn't possible to distinguish between a
Mail and a News folder in a non-News collection: there IS no difference as
either type of message can be saved into any folder.)

Perhaps one day...  (any Pine Feller on the Team care to comment?)

Message-Id: <Pine.SGI.3.93.960724092258.22957C-100000@tower.york.ac.uk>

Pine makes a secondary "lookup" file for each of your addressbooks.  If
this doesn't exist or, for some reason, is out of date Pine automatically
rebuilds it and warns you it is doing so.

This lookup file is placed in the same directory as the addressbook file,
and has the same name but with ".lu" appended (this is for UNIX; I can't
remember the name used for PC-Pine).

When the lookup file has been rebuilt in this way it should be fine for
the remainder of the current Pine session and for future ones.

HOWEVER if you don't have write access to the directory in which the
lookup file lives then Pine can't save the rebuilt version there.  Instead
it puts it in a temporary directory just for this session.  Subsequent
Pine sessions will detect that the lookup file still isn't correct in its
official place, and will rebuild it again (back into the temporary
directory).

The solution is to make sure you have write access to the directory in
which your addressbook files live.  For UNIX this is typically your home
directory, so it would be extremely unusual to experience this problem
(unless you've run out of disk space and the file wasn't created
properly?).

However some people use global (shared) addressbooks, and only have read
access to them and the directory they live in.  If the person who
maintains this global addressbook makes a change to the addresses but
forgets to update the lookup file then the problem you describe will
happen at every Pine startup for everyone who uses that global
addressbook.

The moral is that if you maintain a global addressbook make sure you use
the "pine -create_lu addrbook sort-option" command to update the
associated lookup file (and make sure both addressbook and lookup file are
readable by the people who use them!).  The "-create_lu" command line
option is described in Pine's manual page: "man pine".

Cheers,

Ring them up and ask them.

(Slightly longer answer: there is no reliable way.  The best you can do is
to include a special header (whose syntax I forget) that REQUESTS the
recipient's e-mail program to return an acknowledgement when it is read.
However many e-mail programs do not do this, and those that do have
probably had the feature turned off either by the individual or the system
manager, viewing it as an invasion of their privacy.)

Assuming you have a distribution list set up and are using Pine 3.93 or
later:

1.  Start composing the message.
2.  Put the cursor on a header line and type ^R to see the Rich Headers
    (all available to you).
3.  Type the distribution list's nickname into the "Lcc:" field.
    (This will automatically fill in the "To:" field with the full list
    name, and the "Bcc:" field with the list of recipients.)

When the message is sent out the recipients will only see names listed in
the "To:" and "Cc:" fields; those in the "Bcc:" field will not be
included/shown.

If you have an older version of Pine then put the distribution list alias
directly into the "Bcc:" field (the "Lcc:" field was new in Pine 3.93 (or
possibly 3.92 -- I forget)).

Ummm... I had heard that Pine could cope with distribution lists of up to
a thousands or so recipients.

Some people have reported problems when trying to send a mesage to more
than about 20 recipients.  These cases have invariably been problems not
with Pine, but with a buggy release of the system mail delivery software
(sendmail).

I think you'll need to send a message to the list with a more detailed
explanation of this problem and any error messages you are seeing (say
whether they appear when you include the distribution list, the moment you
send the message, in a message returned to you shortly after sending your
message, etc).

Cheers,

to whom it may concern....

when i am using ctrl-T for spelling it doesn't show me the right way to
spell the word. it just highlights it.
is there a way in my PINE 3.93 version to do it?

thank you.

guil.

I fear you're right.  Perhaps it could be set up for PC Pine?  Or at least
fuller toolbars could be generated?

I'm not convinced that first is necessarily best - especially if the user
base of pine is extending into less 'tecchie' users.  

Evolution or 'downskilling'? :-))

In Pine, I think all you have to do is to place the mailing list in the
bcc line of the header.  (old pine, put sender's address in To, otherwise
sendmail (?) will assume something needs to be put there)

Have you tried creating a forward file in your mail incoming directory,
e.g., /var/spool/mail.  Your global distribution script could generate
this *one-line* file (e.g., deptlist) of the form 

Forward to <addr1> <addr2> ... <addrn>

and your message would be addressed to 'deptlist.'

If you have Pine set up to check for valid local users, you would need to
set up a corresponding passwd file entry for deptlist.

I don't have sysadm privileges anymore, so I can't test this out.  But we
used to use this approach in support of a project with a very large
distribution list.

Nicole, 

Mike speaks the truth. 

We used to include a request for receipt in the message.  Something like

"Please respond by reply e-mail to acknowledge receipt.  Thank you."

Of course, if you are writing to someone working *for* you or to a spouse,
you can drop the 'thank you' or substitute 'or else.'  ;-)

If this is in the while including an original msg. in your reply, 
all yo have to do is go to the beginning of the line hit ^D to delete one

These are symptoms of an imapd that was compiled with the wrong version of
Sun directory access libraries.  I don't recall the recipe for avoiding
the problem, but you can get a precompiled imapd from
ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin/*

Mike,
Having some "per-folder" attributes is still on the list for
consideration, but I don't know when it might bubble to the top.

By default UNIX Pine uses the simple "spell" program.  This just produces
a list of words it doesn't recognise, which Pine then highlights in the
text.  "spell" doesn't offer corrected spellings, nor does it allow you to
easily add your own words to the dictionary.

Pine 3.93(?) onwards support a separate spell checker such as the GNU
"ispell".  Assuming you have ispell (or something equivalent on your
computers) you can set this "alternate speller" up in Pine's Setup
Configuration screen.

ispell does offer suggested alternarive spellings for words it doesn't
recognise, and also allows you to add words easily to a personal
dictionary that is used to supplement the main system-wide one.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

The problem of occasional failures in redrawing the screen when
composing/replying on AIX 4.1 appears to be present in pine 3.95 too. 

There has been a major clean-up for 'build a41', and pine files have been
updated to use the new version of libcurses, but the pico library is still
using tcap.c instead of tinfo.c. After modifying pico/makefile.a41 and
rebuilding the problem did not occur anymore:

49c49
<               pico.o random.o region.o search.o spell.o tcap.o window.o word.o
---
>               pico.o random.o region.o search.o spell.o tinfo.o window.o word.o
53c53
<               pico.c random.c region.c search.c spell.c tcap.c window.c word.c
---
>               pico.c random.c region.c search.c spell.c tinfo.c window.c word.c

Now a wish:
since I am building pine for eight different architectures in parallel, I
would like that the build command returned the exit status of make in case
of errors, just to make it easier to track errors when something goes
wrong.

Well, I have no problems with the OS/2 port (3.94). 
What information does the pine crash give you?

I downloaded pine-3.95, it's in 9 parts, does anyone
know what the command is to bring them together.

It's supposed to be compressed in the tar.gz format.

Thanx in advance.

When I send messages using Pine to large groups of people, the address 
of every person is listed at the top of the message.  In addition to the 
problem of giving out people's e-mail address unwittingly, there is also 
the problem that when people see 700 lines of e-mail addresses, they 
tend to stop looking for the message at the end.  Is there a way in Pine 
to have each recipient of a message only see their own address and that 
of the sender.  I would appreciate any help.  Also, since this is my 
first time using this system, if someone could please e-mail me at 
M_Ostrowski@UH.edu and explain to me how to access answers to my 
questions that would also help.  

Thanks,
Mark Ostrowski

Could you please give me some information on how, if it is possible, I 
could download pine onto my computer.  I haven't been able to find 
anything about downloading pine, just some other information.  

                            Thank-You

Is it possible to specify a 'blind copy' to recipients (i.e., a cc of a
memo to someone, where the addressee doesn't see the recipients in the cc
field)?  This kind of addressing comes in handy when you need to keep
someone posted on some exchange, but you might want to avoid having the
recipient reply to other recipients.

thanks
Chris Moore

The problem is specifically this. The long list to which I refer is in a
global addressbook built by an external utility. The error happens the
first time Pine encounters that global addressbook. I can't remember
exactly what the error message was, because we have fixed it by shortening
the addresses, but it was related to the fact that, within the global
addressbook file, the text line which represents a group containing about
fifty e-mail addresses was too long.  You say, however, that Pine should
be able to deal with groups of thousands .. and I believe you! Perhaps
when Pine is creating groups itself from user input it can start a new
"line" now and then within the same group to cope with this problem. 
Perhaps I should externally create an addressbook with a group near the
known limit, then get Pine to add more names to the group - then look at
the file to see how Pine has got over the problem?

Yes, there is a line length limit of 1000 characters.  You're idea is a
good one.  You don't have to create a huge list to see how pine wraps long
lines, though, just a list which is long enough to cause the line to be
more than 70 or 80 characters.  If you have any lists in your address book
you probably already have some that are wrapped (lines beginning with
spaces).  Thanks.

My system is Solaris 2.4 ( "SUNOS 5.4 UNIX SVR4"  ) running on X86 
platform . Where can I find the pre-compiled UNIX bin of imapd ?
I could find only the SPARC version of the binaries. 
I tried to compile the source code , but could not succeed with either
OSTYPE sol, sun, gso, gsu.

Pls help .

This is often a problem when there isn't enough space in /tmp for ar to do
all its work.  See the man page for `ar', specifically the `l' (that's an `L')
option.  This may solve your problem.

I haven't seen that before.  I just tried it on a 2100 running 3.2c and it
compiles.  If you have software support, you may want to check into getting
patches for some of the /usr/ccs tools.

Our system environment is 
Solaris 2.4 ( x86 )

We were using Pine on Unix. I have downloaded PC-PINE 3.95 and with a 
older version of IMAPD, the foll is the prob:
The remote folder by name "SENT" is seen as "NT" clipping out first 2 
letters. Saw the same problem mentioned in Pine-Info forum but could not 
know the exact solution. 

Downloaded the Pine3.95 source and tried to compile it . 
When I use gcc compiler, I get errors like "undefined symbol" errors . 
Symbols mentioned are flock, random , Strtr etc etc . 

Pls suggest what OSTYPE to be used for this system. 
Have tried gsol, gsun etc 


With the /usr/ucb/cc compiler , I get the foll error

"Optional Language Packages not installed " . Looks like all packages are 
installed . Anything to do with the Path settings etc .

Pls help .

Hi!

I tried to switch on to tenex format, and found *VERY* annoying feature:

  !! I cannot save message in tenex folder when being in mbox !!

It means, that if I get a mail in system mbox (which I wont change to
tenex for obvious reasons), I cannot save it in tenex folder. 

It it intentional design? Could it be somehow changed?

greetings

I wouldn't reinvent the wheel *if* you have access to trn on your system.
Even if you don't want to use trn for newsreading (though you should! :-) )
you can still use it for killing articles.

I thought for sure trn had some spanky command line option to allow you
to start up in a group and run your ``memorized commands'' immediately
(thereby killing articles), but I can't find it in the faq or documentation
anywhere.  No matter, we can roll our own.

Here's what you can try:

1) start up trn in the group you want to read, and set up your kill file.
Being you know what a killfile is and are sophisticated enough to filter
your email via procmail I'll assume you can figure out how to set up a trn
killfile (if not, consult the killfile & trn faqs on news.software.readers).

2) All you then need to do is start up trn and enter the group you want to
filter, then quit trn.  You can do that either manually or (if you also
have `expect' on your system) you can do it with an expect script.  The
script might look something like this:


#!/usr/local/bin/expect

#A quick hack to start up trn in the newsgroup passed as the first argument
#on the command line, run the killfile, then exit trn.  This script is not
#robust; many things could be improved.

#set newsgroup to be whatever's passed on the command line.
set newsgroup [ lindex $argv 0 ]
set timeout 30

#hide trn's output, change to `log_user 1' to watch what's happening.
log_user 0

spawn trn $newsgroup

expect {
	"*ynq] " {
		send "y\r"
	}
	timeout	{ puts "$expect_out(buffer)" ; exit }
}

expect {
	"Type space to continue]*" { send "q\r" }
	timeout { puts "$expect_out(buffer)" ; exit }
}

expect {
	"articles are selected*"	{ send "q\r" }
	"what next\? \[npq]*" 		{ send "q\r" }
	eof { exit }
}

expect {
	"End of newsgroups*" 		{ send "q\r" }
	eof { exit }
}

# one last time, just to make sure
expect {
	eof { exit }
	"End of newsgroups*" { send "q\r" }
}

log_user 1

------------end of script---------------




I'm no expect expert (so that's probably pretty terrible `expect'), but it
worked with the trn on my system.  It may work on yours too.

Once you have the script working and your killfile set up, all you would
need to do would be add the following line to your .profile or .login:


	kill.exp sci.whatever.group


By the time you get logged in, your .newsrc will be updated and you can
read news with pine.

Howdy,

I compiled a 2.0.0 kernel a few days ago and remember seeing a
reference to a kernel level file locking feature.  I would recommend
taking a look around in the Configure.help file in the "Documentation"
directory under the /usr/src/linux (or wherever you put your kernel
source) tree.


Good luck,
Rod

   I've got a major lock problem here on my system.  After upgrading to Linux
   2.0 from 1.2.13 and also swapping disks (involving the tarring and
   untarring of large volumes of files :) my user pine mailboxes (inbox AND
   all user-created boxes) have locks on them that will not go away.  I've
   checked permissions, tried find for .pine or .lock files, in short done
   just about everything I could think of, yet these locks remain.  The
   side-note is that all root mailboxes work fine.  I had the problem under
   3.91 but since upgraded to 3.94 and the problems remain.
   Please help, it's been plaguing me for days!
   Thanks!

We have noticed lately that pine 3.94 seems to hang when you try to send
a large e-mail (say several hundred lines).  It will start burning CPU
and never return from the mail sending operation.  We are using pine on
HP 9000 boxes running HP-UX 10.10 (plus all current patches).  Anybody
else seen this problem?

I've grabbed pine 3.95 and will see if the problem goes away with the new
version.  How come there is no list of changes/bug fixes anywhere in the
source code distribution?  What got fixed between 3.94 and 3.95?

One option would be to use the Bcc field for the groups, instead of
the To field.  Then the recipients don't see the list of everybody
getting the message.

Another option would be to use an external list server that remails to
everybody on the list.

I am experimenting with Pine 3.95 and when I switch back and forth 
between 3.91 and 3.95 my addressbook.lu file keeps getting rewritten, 
with pine saying the format is invalid.  Is there a change?  I am using 
public addressbooks so this is a problem.

I have more than one e-mail address.  I read my mail using a system 
called Bayou.  My address on Bayou is pols2gl@Bayou.UH.edu.  However, I 
would prefer to have messages sent to M_Ostrowski@UH.edu which then 
forwards the message to my Bayou account.  The problem is this.  When I 
use pine in Bayou, recipients of my messages see the return address of 
pols2gl@Bayou.uh.edu.  Is there a way to change the return address in 
Pine?  I would really rather that people could not even see the Bayou 
address to avoid confusion. I would greatly appreciate any help.

Yes, the format has indeed changed and the .lu files are rebuilt when
versions are switched.

Decide on which version currently is most used at your site and build .lu
files for it, then leave the remainder to rely on Pine's automatic
temporary rebuilding (whose effect only lasts the session).

Alternatively configure the different versions of Pine to use different
shared addressbooks (which will each have their own .lu file in the
appropriate format).  This relies on you being able to persuade your Pine
to either startup using a different .pinerc and/or pine.conf file (check
the man page: I think the command line option is something like "-p" or
"-P") or, like we do here, tweak the name of the systemwide pine.conf file
it uses to include a vesion number.  (For example we have had
pine.conf-3.91, pine.conf-3.93, etc) 

Cheers,

You've got all the information that it provides in the above lines.
Extremely helpful, I know.  But all that it offers.

Well, since this is comp.mail.pine and not comp.mail.pine.questions.only,
</joke>, I thought it might be in place to congradulate the PINE TEAM on
a great job! I just installed the mentioned version on my Linux 1.3.20,
and I find it better than ever, though PINE has always been my preferred
mailer ever since my first day on the net. As I use a script that invokes
popclient, I have no problems or irritations over the lacking pop3
feature, as a matter of fact I find it a relief it's not there as I can
get remote mail when it's neccessary. Ok, nuff said.. PINE is great ;)

	There are two pointers on my website

checks the keyservers if you don't have a key on your keychain. Talk

We just converted our 14,000 users from 3.91 to 3.95, primarily to take
advantage of the new upload/download features in our menued environment. A
small percentage of our users have suddenly developed screen-related
problems that appear to be terminal emulation. The symptoms are:
Disappearing screens that appear line by line as the cursor passes over
them, yet all commands work as advertised. Menus not appearing at all.
Resultant confusion and calls to our support line. 

We have long insisted upon VT-100 terminal emulation, both because of Pine
and because of other programs on our system that require it. Vt-102 and
VT-220 often work as well. We use a SUN SPARC20 on OS 4.1.4. We also cast
a jaundiced eye on "Lite" versions of software (COMit Lite, for example)
that don't REALLY have VT-100 terminal emulation, even though they claim
it. We often tell people to go get a real program and call us back. But
this problem is NOT happening with that class of user. This is happening
with people who have used Pine for a couple of years with great success
who are now asking what in heavens we did to mess them up. 

The odd thing is, it is not consistent. I use Procomm Plus for Windows.
Set to VT-100 and going through our modems, everything works fine. It
worked fine in Pine 3.89. It works fine now in 3.95. It always has. Yet
someone else using the same program set to the same settings has this
problem. I suppose it could be the users' modems themselves, but that
seems to me to be a stretch. 

If y'all have a clue, tell me. I sure don't!

Can you tell why inn doesn't like Pine's Message-Id?  Are you posting

I am running HP-UX 10 and using PC-Pine on a Windows 95 machine.  Every time 
I run PC-Pine I get two errors.  They won't go away, they repeat constantly, and
PC-Pine hangs (not responding).  I finally have to Ctrl-Alt-Delete and kill it
under Win95.

I traced the source of the problem.  I'm using and IMAP daemon written by
the folks who write Siren Mail (Siren Software, division of Vicor).  If  I 
switch to the IMAP server written by the Pine folks, the error goes away.  Any
ideas?  I'm going to follow up with Vicor, too.  They have an IMAP+ server, I
think it's like IMSP or whatever.  They use it to save user configuration
info on the server so you can have your own personal configuration regardless
of your location.

    This maybe a FAQ, but I could not find the answer there.  How does
one send email to Compuserve folk.  They have a comma in their address
which Pine does not like.

I just used pcpico, and it worked great, except:
* I can find no help on command line switches.
* When I try switches on the command line, I get some switches causing 2 
beeps, bringup the editor, but saying "[option "-??" not known]" or 
something like that.  Other times, the editor starts, with no errors, but 
with no "[new file]" message.  The only time something else happens is 
when I use "-o" on the command line.  When I do this, I get a  "unknown, 
or empty option -o", displayed on the screen, and then another dos prompt.
* there is no way to tell pcpine what spell checker to use, and the ^t 
command seys "command not known", eventhough the help file says that it 
should be there.

Can anyone tell me about any of this?
I seem to have lost the address of whoever sent me the program.

Just received our new domain name from NIC.  All mail to mycompany.com
should go into my mailbox and I can use procmail to filter who the
mail should go to.  But when various users send mail, they want their 
own name to be on the From: line like george@mycompany.com

I have found no way to edit From: or to have an addressbook-type
list of legal names to insert for From:

Any suggestions?

Thanks for thinking about that and letting me know.

Subject: BUG: tenex format doesn't handle empty body. Pine 3.95
Message-Id: <Pine.SV4.3.95.960726173738.10711A-100000@itsrm1>
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi!

I recently switched to tenex format. As it is not possible to save mail
between different format folders, I setup file ~/mail.txt on my IMAP host
to get INBOX in tenex format as well.

It all worked pretty well until I got message with empty body (it comes
among other things as delivery notification from file transfer program).
And it didn't work!!! Such a message appears as

      2                                    [ No Message Text Available ]

in index screen; if I try to read it, I get all headers shown as *message
body*. No flags etc are visible;  thanks God, I can at least delete it ;)

Note, that absolutely the same messages were treated just fine when being
in INBOX (default system mbox).

The situation is really bad. I don't like to return to mbox and I hence do
need mail.txt and I do need these empty messages.

Note, that contents of mbox *is* correct: headers + empty line. Here
*nothing* was changed. Tenex (mail.txt) is also correct, as far as I can
tell: tenex separator + headers *without empty line after*. 

Now, either IMAPd makes error when parsing such message or when moving it
form mbox - it doesn't matter for my sake.

I use Pine 3.95 and IMAPd which comes with Pine 3.95.

It is straightforward to reproduce:

1. create mail.txt in your home directory;
2. send itself a simple mail:

% sendmail -t your_user_name
From: foo
Subject: bar
^D
% 

3. and try to read it now.

Let me know if it suddenly works ;) (Don't send empty mail with Pine - it
comes as message with one empty line *in body* as opposed to null body).

greetings

I have been using the pine discussion archives at:

http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine-info

to research my interest in pine.  Does anyone know how I can do a seach 
at this site and collect all of the seach results into a single file for 
downloading.  I know that I can download an entire month of discussion 
archives from this site, however, there is a lot of stuff that I don't need.

Perhaps someone knows of a way that I can take an entire month and 
automatically cut out those things I do not wish to keep. Please help.

Hi,

I use an SMTP server option on our system.
When sending a message under a different address to my usual one (Pine
is compiled with the ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM option), I have recently found
that an associate seemed to be replying to the wrong address.

I investigated this and found that the Return-Path for the delivered
message had the original "From:" line in and not the new address, which
meant the reply went to whatever the From: line was as I entered the
Compose window.

Some mail systems are broken (like MSMail) and reply to the Return-Path
rather than the Reply-To/From/Sender lines, which means that it ends up
in the wromg mailbox. I, for example, default it to "postmaster" but
often change this to "x400-support" depending on the support mail I am
replying to.

Should this be considered a bug?

The Pine-Info archives are IMAP accessible, too; the folder collection
definition in PINE would be: 

*{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

We are currently planning to support ACAP (the successor to IMSP) in
Pine 4.x, but do not have any of it implemented yet.

I've just finished configuring PGP to work with Pine verson 3.93 for UNIX,
using the "display-filters" and "sending-filters" options in the Setup.
It works very well.     

I thought I might do the same in for a different account where I use 
PCPine 32 bit Version 3.95. Using the same principles, I should be able to
write a batch file to do the job of the shell script in UNIX. It does not
seem to work - not because the batch file doesn't work - but because Pine
does not ask if I want to apply a filter when I'm ready to send. 
Essentially it ignores the filter configuration completely.

I've looked through the release notes and all the help screen on the 
subject, and nowhere does it say that this feature does not work with 
PCPine. Am I missing something?

A second question to which I have not been able to get a clear answer: Is
it possible to point PCPine to 2 different servers (separately, at
different times) without having to run two different executables? I tried
creating two directories with different pinerc and other configuration
files in each. I thought If I created two Win95 shortcuts each starting in
its own directory, but pointing to the same executable, it should work.
But no dice, I'm afraid. 

Does any one have any ideas?


Thanks

Ari Spanos

Has anyone implemented a Pine installation on a system using MH?
If yes what is the trick to read the folders?

We have installed Pine on an OSF/1 Dec machine but we can't read our

Any help would be apprecieted..

We noticed that problem on a Solaris 2.4 machine with pine 3.94.  I
couldn't reproduce the problem on my workstation, which was then running
Digital Unix 3.2c, so it may be operating system specific.

Hi,
  I am not regularly reading this list, but there's one thing about Pine on my
machine that really annoys me. I'm using Pine 3.93 on NetBSD. The problem is
following:
 When I post a message to any newsgroup everything seems to be OK. When,
however, I see it appear on the list, instead of seeing contents of From:
field in the browser (i.e. my address & name) I see the following:
"To:foo@bar.com".
Where's the problem. Is it a bug in my version of Pine? Or am I doing anything
wrong?
It is not that I want to see my name ;-))) but it looks stupid and annoying on
the list - one doesn't know who the message came from.
Here's contents of my personal configuration file:
================================= .pinerc ==================================

# Updated by Pine(tm) 3.93, copyright 1989-1996 University of Washington.
#
# Pine configuration file -- customize as needed.
#
# This file sets the configuration options used by Pine and PC-Pine.  If you
# are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide configuration
# file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments in
# this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about
# specific settings see the section on configuration options in the Pine
# notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.
# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated
# by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a
# continuation of the previous line.  For a variable to be unset its value
# must be blank.  To set a variable to the empty string its value should
# be "".  You can override system defaults by setting a variable to the
# empty string.  Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and
# default to "no".
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Pine.

First of all can anyone see this.  If yes please somebody let me know.
Second, the question I have.  It is an interesting one.  
I believe it is called the attribution string, and I would like to change
it.  It is the thing that shows up when you include tesxt in a reply.
Something like    on %date% %name% wrote...
thing.  I would like to change that.
Thanks to all who repsond, and everyone else just for good measure.

    The general answer is ........ NO.  Some proprietary mail systems
allow this, but there is no Internet-wide standard for it, and
therefore no general way to do it.

Subject: Pine and MH
Date: 26 Jul 1996 21:55:06 GMT
Message-Id: <4tberq$j2b@post.gsfc.nasa.gov>


I'm looking for an easy-to-use text-based mail program which runs on text-based
terminals to supplement the X-windows based applications that we already use.
Since the X-windows applications use MH for the folders, the text based program
must also use MH.

I've copied over a copy of Pine, and the documentation seems to suggest that it
is capable of at least reading MH folders although it's not clear how to make
it do that.  It's also not clear whether or not Pine can also save properly to
MH folders, as well as read them.

Can anyone suggest how to proceed?  Is Pine the right software for my
application?  Please respond by email to

	thompson@orpheus.nascom.nasa.gov

as I don't usually read this newsgroup.

Thank you,

William Thompson

    True, but some of us want to read news and mail with an easy to 
use and easy to learn tool such as Pine, not spend half our lives
struggling with the tool itself.  I, for one, have better things to 
do with my life than struggle with monster learning curves.  That's
why I have stuck with Pine.  Not everybody needs to go to the grocery
store in an 18-wheel semi; sometimes a bicycle will do just fine.

When I forward a newsgroup article via e-mail from a newsreader, the
message shows up as an attachment in the resulting e-mail.  Although all
the headers of this attached message appear in the file '.incoming_mail',
they are not displayed when I read the e-mail in Pine (Unix).
Furthermore, there seems to be no way to get Pine to display those
headers; it displays only the four main header fields (Date:, From:,
Newsgroups, Subject:).  Worse, when I export the message from Pine to a
file, the file does not contain all of the attachment's headers.

Is there a way to get Pine to show (or at least to export) all the headers
that are in the attachment?

Perhaps someone can help.

unix Pine 3.91  

Worked great for 16 months posting to sci.aeronautics.airliners from my
present service which is incapable of fixing the problem. 

While Pine 3.95 is now out, that shouldn't be the problem as 3.91 has
worked fine previously. 

Recently have gotten the incomplete error message:

[Posting news.....][*Error posting message:  ?3nau
tics-airliners@moderators.uu.net... Address]

Occasionally, after the word... Address] will be... Address contains]

What might the remainder of error message say?

I can post to any other Usenet newsgroup EXCEPT the three sci.aeronautics.*
groups    sci.aeronautics
          sci.aeronautics.simulation
          sci.aeronautics.airliners

I can post to other sci.* groups, just not sci.aeronautics.*

Another customer was kind enough to try a post to
sci.aeronautics.airliners using unix Pine and received the exact same arror
message, so it isn't anything in my work directory nor is it the
newsgroups themselves. 

Thanks for your help.

I guess you cant... :-( (well, some propietary systems let you do it, but
generally speaking, its not implemented. There isn't any RFC concerning it
(as far as I know)...

Well, you can sometimes (it doesn't work quite often) finger the receiver. 
If the systems allows it, you might know at least when did he last check
his mail:

   Just received our new domain name from NIC.  All mail to mycompany.com

I take from your use of procmail that we are speaking of a Unix host.
If the user names match in both the real and fake addresses, you could
set the user-domain variable in the pine.conf global configuration file.

A mailer-independent solution would involve sendmail.  For instance, if
you have a BSD 8.x sendmail with m4-generated config files, then the
MASQUERADE_AS feature will accomplish what you need.

   I have found no way to edit From: or to have an addressbook-type
   list of legal names to insert for From:

Here it sounds like you might desire aliasing the hostname for some
addresses and not for others.  A sendmail solution is sufficient and, as
far as I know, necessary for this.  See the Multiple Domains and Virtual
Domains topics in comp.mail.sendmail for details.

Hoping this helps,

Hi. 
I would like the mail folder of incoming and outgoing messages to be in a 
different directory as where PC pine is installed. Can someone suggest 
how this can be done? Thanks.

How do I get the "folders" screen to show me just a few newsgroups ?  At
present my option(s) is(are) to place the cursor on some message which
says "press here to see the list" or something similar; which I do, and
gen appears a list of 845,917 usenet newsgroups.

All I really want to do is read form three or four of them.  I don't want
to see the gargantuan list, repeated each time I open it.  I just want to
see my little closed-minded, biggoted, prejudiced, (and whatever other
upopular adjectives may apply this month) list of a few newsgroups, and
not have to choose this menu which produces a list of twelve zillion
choices, from which I choose another choice, which then produces an\other
waiting period while pine places "-\-/|\-/|".....and so on for about 2
minutes and so on and so on.



I tried the "add" suggestion offered to another poster here earlier, and
pine just tells me that I am already subscribed to that newsgroup.

That's the problem.  I'm subscribed to  all zillion of them.

Is it really that hard to put threee or four names on the screen, and let
me choose the one I want ?

I am certain there is a faq for pine.

I have never seen/read it.

I am making a wild, totally-uninformed, totally-uneducated etc.etc. guess
with this assertion:  The faq is a zillion lines long and contains
jillions of questions.

My amazing psychic powers tell me that 90% of the questions posted here in
the newsgroup are variations on a basic pool of, say, 10 or 20 questions.

Now, I once met a graduate from the university which is credited with the
creation/promulgation of pine, and she was a pretty smart human, and I'll
betcha that most of the other folks up there in Washington are also smart.

So,,,,,,,,,

How about preparing, and posting, a list of the *-MOST-* frequently asked
questions.

The answers to the questions should follow this format.......


	Push this key and wait for the such-and-so screen to appear
	Push that key and wait for action-X to occur
	Push the other key and wait for response-Y
	etc.
	etc.
	etc.


On the other hand, maybe I should just buy some pathetically overpowered
monster-chip (e.g.pentium, sparcSomething, whatever) and load it with some
pathetically inefficient software and buy a PPP account.

My current observation on the situation is that the only software
developers who are able to....

		-1- make a guess as to what questions the user is
		    likely to ask

		-2- produce an answer composed of sentences which 
		    are structured with the subject/predicate idea 
		    which was taught back in the 6th grade in 
		    elementary school

		-3- differentiate between various parts of speech
		    such as nouns and verbs and adjectives and 
		    so on which was also taught back in the 6th 
		    grade

		-4- produce a sentence of semantic substance

		-5- use appropriate punctuation in their writing 
		    to clarify concepts when specific parts of 
		    speech (such as nouns) are used as other 
		    parts of speech (such as verbs or adjectives)

		-6- place these sentences on the screen in such 
		    a manner as to facilitate clear written 
		    communication


... are "incapable of" (polite way of saying too stupid and/or lazy)
writing software which will run on a simpler machine.


Conversely, those software writers who produce software which doesn't
require a zillion mFlops (or a gig of ram or 18 hard disks or a clock
speed of a terahertz, etc.) are "incapable of" (polite, again) producing
sentences which meet the 6 criteria above.

Therefore, I will migrate away from those packages which can't explain
their own use, and migrate toward those packs whose authors are able to
explain their use.

Just in case nobody's really following any of this,,,,,

There's a bunch of money and/or fame  to be made from all of this, and
I'm not the least bit interested today (and probably never) in entering
such a market to compete for those dollars.

But,,,,,

If somebody *-does-* have the ability to communicate with sensible
sentences with semantic substance, and that same somebody  can write
software which is not pathetically inefficient (i.e. it doesn't require
the latest fastest machine on earth to run), then,,,,,

		That software and its developer will become 
		famous, and probably make a lot of money.

Assuming, of course, that such a person/company/party did create such a
news/email/whatever package.

That will never happen.  

This post is an entire waste of my time.

The end

    I want to publicly thank Tim Mooney for his suggestions for using
trn as a preprocessor for newsgroups to implement a sort of killfile
before Pine reads the news.  I had to do a bit of kludging and it isn't
perfect, but it is a lot better than what I had (i.e., nothing, with
Pine).  I used the trnkill script off the 'net rather than Tim's Expect
script, and things are working reasonably well, so I don't have to plow
my way through a bunch of inappropriate trash on some flooded
newsgroups.  Thanks, Tim.

    (For everyone's information, this pseudo-killfile technique for
news only works on Un*x systems which also have a relatively recent
version of the newsreader trn.  Also, it takes a minute or two to get
the hank of trn killfiles.)

I believe there is no way to know if someone read an email sent
through the Internet. On private LANS, some programs do allow this
capability. Groupwise is one package that will tell you if someone has
opened your mail message.

Pine doesn't talk to the NNTP server while building the newsgroups
list.  Could you give us more details about your configuration and
anything else unusual that might be occuring at the time you see the
problem?

I've tried setting the upload command in pine to run rz but when I then
try to upload an attachment (^J,^Y) all I get is a blank screen and not
the usual zmodem **000027fed line, and my PC's zmodem does not negotiate
anything with the unix zmodem.  Download works fine with sz however from
exporting.

Get /usr/ucb out of your path.  You may have to hack the makefiles,
but the basic thing is that the libraries in /usr/ucblib are broken.
If you're linking against them, you're going to have his trouble.
Recompile when you have this corrected.

My guess is that the PC is decoding your binary just fine, but then
displaying it on the screen instead on saving it to a file.

I am not a regular reader of this newsgroup but I have a question that I

reliable mail client that supports IMSP. Has any work been done with Pine
in this area?

If you have access to tin on your system, you can subscrib and 
unsubscribe to newsgroups there.  If I am not mistaken, pine uses the 
same file that tin uses to read the available news groups.  I simply 
unsubscribed to all newsgroups using tin.  In pine, I subscribed to each 
of the ones I wanted individually.  Only those that I am subscribed to 
show up in pine.  When I want to search for a particular group, I use tin 
to accomplish this.  Hope this helps.

    You did not say what system -- Un*x, DOS, Windoozy, whatever -- you
are using Pine under, so I will use the example of Un*x.  Pine uses
your .newsrc file.  Mine is quite small -- it has only the newsgroups
to which I am subscribed.  You might try this.  First, change to your
home directory.  THEN, MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR .NEWSRC FILE IN CASE
SOMETHING GOES WRONG.  Next, with a good text editor, simply delete the
entries for all the newsgroups (i.e., nearly all of them) that you
don't want.

    You could search for the names of all the groups that you do want
and move them all to the top of the file and delete everything else
below them.  Be sure to move the entire line in which the name occurs. 
Be aware that Pine will display the newsgroups in the folder collection
in the order in which they appear in the .newsrc file.  After you edit
out the zillion groups you don't want, Pine should show you only the
few groups you do want.

    Editing the .newsrc file by hand should be done with very great
care.  That's why you should make a backup copy first so you can back
out if things get messed up.

Myron,

After you have concluded your search of the subject or full-text index at
	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
you could save the results page to a local HTML file.  Since the hyperlinks
therein will be relative (i.e., "assume" they are on the server
http://www.cac.washington.edu/), you should then load the HTML file into a
text editor that has that capability and search-and-replace all occurrences
of

	<a HREF="/pine/pine-info
with
	<a HREF="http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine-info

You then have your own customized message index that will point back to the
HTMLized messages you selected in your query, on our server.  (The URLs for
the individual messages are expected to remain stable, though we can't
guarantee that. ;-)  


If you an have IMAP-capable email client, you can also access the Pine-Info
archives in their original message (non-HTMLized) format; in Pine, by
defining a folder collection thus: 

	*{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

You would then have to search each month's message collection separately
(in Pine, with the SELECT ; function), but if you are only interested in a
time period of a few months, that would actually be easier and more direct
here than in the WWW-based archives' searchable index, where you'd have to
formulate a query like "Jun 96;bulk mail".

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Pine advisor:

My university uses Pine as its main mail delivery system.  I know pretty 
much how to use most of its functions, but have not been able to forward 
a whole folder, like inbox, sent-mail, or the like whithout having to 
download them onto my hard disk then re-address them as attachments to a 
regular mail message.  Isn't there a simpler way to do it, say just the 
same way you forward a file (message)?

I would appreciate your help.  

By the way is there a complete Pine manual somewhere on-line that I 
could download that explains such questions so that I don't have to 
bother you.

Thank you for your cooperation.

I assume you mean Pine on our unix systems, cunix.  You could attach
any mail file using the Attachment header or the attach command.  The
names of the files are "mail/" followed by the "folder" name, i.e.
the sent-mail folder is mail/sent-mail.  The one that is different is
INBOX, which will vary on different systems, but on cunix is a file
named mbox without "mail/" in front of it.  These files will attach
the same as any file.

Please send Pine questions locally to bug-pine@columbia.edu or
consultant@columbia.edu, since there are a few local peculiarities
we can help with.

Message-Id: <4tbl3f$9lj@www.gnofn.org>

I have recently learned how to create a "signature" which appears 
automatically on all of my out-going mail. There are, however, times when 
I do not want this signature to appear. Is there a quick and simple way 
of omitting it while in the "compose" mode? If not, what would be the 
easiest way to do this? Perhaps there is something in the config file 
that controls this...

Any suggestions or advice to this new user would be most appreciated.

Thank you,

I'm new to Pine and I'm still trying to work my way through it. However, 
"Help" wasn't any help when trying to print my email message.  I type "Y" 
and say yes to "attached-to-ansi", but nothing prints.  I assume 
something isn't set in my comms software.

Also, possibly related, some keystrokes are not recognized.  Such as the 
arrow keys won't allow me to scroll.

Tried changing control flow as suggested in "Help".  Please advise.

TIA

I noticed pine had  quite a few problems with our terminals, and it all was
related to XON/XOFF handshaking which pine venomously ignores. This fixed
the problem nicely.

	There is no "prompt for signature" option within pine.

	You have some choices....

1.	Always append signature and delete it when you don't want it
	sent.

2.	Never append signature and use cntrl-R function to read it in
	when needed.

3.	Get creative and use the "OPTION: Sending-Filters".  (Are 
	signatures worth the effort??)

	Regards,

I think that you can use the (;) to select all of the messages in a 
folder.  Following this use the (A) apply, followed by (F) to forward all 
of the messages as a group.  Hope this helps.

I simply use my arrow keys to move the cursor in the area of the attached 
signature.  I use the back space key to delete what I want.  If this works 
you shoud see that part of my e-mail address below is missing.

I have a problem here with PC-PINE 3.95 ( both 16 and 32 bit versions ) on
Windows 95 . 

PC-Pine 16 bit is working fine on Win 3.1 with Trumpet Winsock with the
same IMAP server . 

Whereas, PC-Pine on Win 95 client with its own TCPIP stack ( not using
Trumpet) gives the foll error on startup:

"Cannot Connect to gpnet.gpbkk.th.orgm,143: Refused (10061) "

Unix Pine works fine on Win 95 confign except for print problems. 

Pls help

From the error msg, it appears that you have typographic error in your
pinerc file in the win95 config: there should not be an "m" after "org" at
the end of the IMAP server name.  If that's not the case, pls let me know.

The printer problems with Unix Pine are expected if you are using the
terminal emulator that comes with Win 95: it does not support ANSI
escape sequences for printing.

In that case I have no clues.  I just tried configuring your IMAP server
name as my inbox path, and --using the 32bit PC-Pine on Win 95-- was able
to connect to your server without error.

A simpler solution is to edit the downloaded file and, in the
<HEAD>...</HEAD> section add the one line:

	<BASE HREF="URL">

where URL is the full URL of the document that you saved to an HTML file
(eg, http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/)

The magical thing about "BASE" is that the URL specified will be used as
the base against which relative links are resolved (instead of the URL of
the current document which, after saving to a local disk file, would be
inappropriate).

Perhaps the Keeper Of The Pine Archives could consider adding/generating a
suitable "BASE" line directly?  This would then allow people to save the
results page to local disk and use it without the need for any editing.

The (;) command will only work if you select the feature in the configuration
screen.  The feature is called enable-aggregate-command-set.  And you would
have to (;) select, (A) all, (A) apply, and then (F) forward.

Subject: TAB completion of filenames
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I am using PINE 3.92. Why does filename completion (TAB key) not work
in the matter of bash and tcsh? After completing a directory name
PINE does not add a slash automatically, but the above shells do.

Because I must hold down the Shift-key while typing the slash, it would be
fine PINE could `type' the slash for me.

Please answer my question.
Thanks.

of PINE and I wondered if you knew of anything for Netscape.

Thanks for you time.

Here at Harvard, 3.95 was made available on Friday, July 26.  One of the
first things I noticed was that the " + " symbol that used to appear in my
Inbox message list, to indicate those messages which had been sent to me
directly as opposed to from a listserv and c., no longer appeared?  I'm
wondering if this is on purpose or a glitch, as info about this feature
does still appear in the help-screen.

Thanks,

Shawn Hill

Check with your systems administrator. The "+" still appears on my
messages. I suspect it is a configuration issue.

Sorry for my silly question:
I use pine under linux. When I start pine I get the prompt, that the
mails are locked and read only ( - I cannot delete them). How can I
get rid of this lock without beeing a superuser? 
(The mailbox is updated with popclient.)

Thank you

What you do is put the list in the Bcc, Cc, or Lcc field then in the To
field put in a ":;" (a colon followed by a semi-colon) and that will do the
trick for you.  Although this will not allow each recipient to see their
address only What they will see in the To: field is To: Undisclosed
Recipients:; .  If you want to change that you can do one of two things.  in
the To: field type something in that is not an address like dept_list, :; or
in the configuration screen (type M (main menu), S (setup), C (config),
W(whereis), empty-header-message) select the empty-header-message feature and
add in what ever you want and this will replace the default.  For example I
have mine set to "A list of my favorite people", so every time I send out a

I am not sure where your account is at (either home, work, or school) so I
will give you two answers.  1.)  If you have a nntp-server where you are at in
the configuration screen add the server in the nntp-server area.  Then in the
Folder List screen tab/arrow down to the News-collection area and type A
(subscribe) and enter in the name of this newsgroup (comp.mail.pine).   2.)
It is available on the Web at news: comp.mail.pine

Pine can have be easily configured for multiple news servers, but
can it also be configured to make use of different .newsrc files
for distinct news collections?

I have asked this question before, but either there was
no answer or I missed it (or it was in a funny place [sorry, private
joke for linguists]).

Is there a way to reclaim the lock on a remote folder such as an
INBOX without having to quit and restart pine.  I am using 3.94.

I'm using Pine 3.91 under AIX 4.1.4 on an RS 6000 59H; I use vi as my
alternate editor (pico's okay for most things, but...).  I'd like to
pass vi an invocation option, so I modified the entry in my Pine configs
to look like
   editor = /usr/bin/vi -c "set nonumber" 
(and other variations on that) with no success.  Can anyone tell me if
(and how) it is possible to invoke the alternate editor with options?

Thanks, Mike Graham

I have tried it and it works.  You can have separate news collections
for which point to different news servers.

Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to get them to use separate
.newsrc's

FWIW it isn't silly. We've had trouble with just a few users using POP
mail clients that manage to lock their inboxes every single time they use
it. That means we have to go into their inbox and unlock it, and this can
be a drag after the first few dozen times. My conclusion thus far is that
it's got to be a config problem (brilliant, huh?) but I haven't found out
where.

Subject: rsh timeout in pine
Message-Id: <DvBH0p.KAu@news.hawaii.edu>
Date: Mon, 29 Jul 1996 18:07:37 GMT

I use pine 3.95 on my linux system with Secure Shell (as a replacement to rsh)
but ssh takes a long time for its RSA authentication.  Pine figures that rsh
has timed out, when it (ssh) actually hasn't.  Is there a user-defined option
that will allow pine to wait longer?

If your address is on the list in the Reply-To: it will be suppressed
when you reply.  I think our assumption was that you probably don't
want to reply to yourself.

Only the comma is required.  Any extra space will be ignored.

Could you send me a sample message that causes this crash when you try

If you already have a signature created all you need to set is a feature
called signature-at-bottom.  If you need more details let me know.

I don't think that there is a way to set it.  All I know of is to do a sort
manually using the $ (sort) option.  If there is a way to set things
differently I would like to know as well.  As for the animals, the bee was cute
but no thank you.

Not all of us replying to these messages are sirs but, I will answer your
question anyway.  What you do is put the list in the Bcc, Cc, or Lcc field
then in the To field put in a ":;" (a colon followed by a semi-colon) and that
will do the trick for you.

Thank you for reporting this problem.

Technically, it is a software bug to write a message without the blank line at
the end of the header.  The blank line is part of the header, and should be
included even if the text body is empty.  As you observed, in some formats,
this was treated as an empty header and all of the text in the text body
instead of as a header with no text body.

Although the real bug is in the delivery agent which wrote the message, we
agree that the current behavior is not very useful.  This is changed in
today's version of the imap-4 toolkit, and thus the problem will be fixed in
Pine 4.0.

You can fix your IMAP access to tenex mailboxes now, by installing the IMAP
server from
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z
You'll have to wait until Pine 4.0 to get the fix for local file access.

Use a text editor like pico to produce the signature.  Name the file 
nameoffile.signaure.  (nameoffile is your files name :-)  ) In the pine 
setup area indicate the name of this file in the place that indicates 
signature-file.  Exit and then restart pine.  Each time you start 
composing a message, the signature should appear.  
That's it.  Hope this helps.

Dear gentlemen

I have already received your document about Pine with frequently asked
questions. However, I didn't find there a description about how to attach
and, decipher a message with a binary file attachment.
Would you mine explain me the hole procedure; how can someone attach a
binary file to a message, and dicepher a message and export a binary file attached?

Thank you in advanced

Yours very sincerely

This may be a FAQ, but I've found no way to go to a particular line number
in a file with pico.  I know how to skip to the end of the file using the
Whereis command, but that appears to be about it for precise positioning
capabilities.

Is the feature there and I've just missed it, or can't it be done with the
current version of pico?   I see the `gotoline' function in pico/basic.c,
so it shouldn't be too difficult to add support for `goto line #:' capability,
if it's not already there.

If it can't be done and the pine/pico authors are watching, perhaps you 
might want to add a `line-number' option to the Whereis command of pico.

When I print from pine, chunks of the message are missing. How can I fix
this?

I have an old Tandy 1000 sx with a Tandy dot matrix printer, DMP 130A.
When I turn on the PC it says "Memory 384K". I load DOS on the A: drive
and Kermit on the B:. There is no C: drive.

I figure the very small memory is my problem. As pine down loads to my
printer it runs out of memory and thus the gaps of info in the printed 
message.

What if anything can I do? Is there some way to slow Pine or have it pace
with my meager PC and memory?

	Doesn't sound like a pine problem.

	There is most likely a problem between your PC and your printer.
Your old PC is still faster then your printer.  That is, the PC can
send information to the printer faster than the printer can print.
Generally, the printer has a "buffer" memory which will hold some of
the data as it comes in.  However, when the buffer comes close to being
full the printer needs to signal the PC to stop sending data.  This is
normally accomplished thru XON/XOFF control.  

	Sounds like your printer/PC/setup is not configured for proper
XON/XOFF.

	A way which may prove this would be to send a large text file
to the printer without the use of pine.  i.e. the normal print function
of your PC.  If it is an XON/XOFF problem then you should see similar
results.

If you name the file .signature, it should be appended automatically by
Pine.  If you have 3.92 or higher, you don't even have to use Pico to
create the file.  Just press S)etup from the main menu and select
S)ignature to edit the default signature file (.signature unless it's been
changed.  Look at the config screen to be sure).

The option that Beth mentioned about signature at bottom just controls
WHERE the signature is placed not whether it's used or not.

XON/XOFF is only used on serial connections (serial printers).  Parallel
printers use a hardware flow control.

The problem does sound like a buffer overflow problem, though.  If you are
using a modem or other direct serial connection, it could be a flow
control problem between your computer and the remote host.

  1. Pull the unix manuals for Pine and Pico.

  2. Go to your local library, read the newsreader tutorials in
     the guides published by Paul Gilster, Harley Haun, et. al.

  3. Your questions will be answered...

We are using Pico 2.7. Does anyone know whether there is any configuration
file or any command line options - or where any help script (other than
the on line help inside Pico) can be found?

For instance can one configure the delete key to act as Control D (as with
Pine) or can you prevent the user from changing the name of the file being
edited? (Eg pico fred - means you can edit fred and save result or
discard, but not change the name "fred" to anything else)

One of the Pine "Frequently Asked Questions" addresses that.  From the
homepage of the Pine Information Center at the URL

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/

select "FAQs" (under "Additional Resources"), then "Addressbook Usage and
Conversions" and then "How do I convert Elm aliases to Pine Addressbook?"
(I didn't just give the URL because the Pine FAQs are being revised and the
URLs will change.)

The URL for the link to the source of Klaus Wacker's elm-to-pine conversion
script is no longer functional (if anyone knows of a replacement, please
let me know), but the text of the script is shown in the FAQ.

Here's a fragment of my folder-collections:

        "Pine-Info Archives"	*{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[],
        "CMU Archives"		{cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/anonymous}[archive.*],
        Net-Happenings		*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/[],
        IMAP/C-Client		*{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}mail/[*_archive]

Note that I have used wild-cards inside the '[]' in a couple of them
to cut out the clutter of other stuff that I'm not interested in.

Assuming that a systemwide pine.conf has been created and set up on your
system...

Edit this file and look (down the bottom) for:

# Sets the time in seconds that Pine will attempt to open a network
# connection.  The default is 30, the minimum is 5, and the maximum is
# system defined (typically 75).
tcp-open-timeout=30

# Sets the time in seconds that Pine will attempt to open a UNIX remote
# shell connection.  The default is 15, min is 5, and max is unlimited.
# Zero disables rsh altogether.
rsh-open-timeout=30

(The values may be different on your system).

Change the values appropriately.

Cheers,

As I remember/understand things...

*  Pine can read Usenet News in two ways: using NNTP or using IMAP.  The
former requires access to a machine running an NNTP server; the latter
access to a machine running an IMAP server configured to supply news
reading as well as mail access.

*  Posting a Usenet News article from Pine always uses NNTP (hence
requiring you have access to an NNTP server which allows you to post).

*  If you use NNTP to read Usenet News the .newsrc file (which keeps track
of which newsgroups you are interested in and which articles you have
read) resides on the machine you are running Pine on.  Pine currently only
supports one such file, which is used for all news collections (even if
they are on different news servers).

*  If you use IMAP to read Usenet News it is the responsibility of the
IMAP server to maintain the list of subscribed newsgroups and read
articles, typically by creating and updating a .newsrc file on the IMAP
server computer itself.

The corollaries of this are:

1.  If you use NNTP to access multiple (different) news servers things
will work, but each news collection (server) will list ALL the subscribed
groups in your (lcocal) .newsrc file.  Not all of these groups may
actually be present on the server.

2.  If you use IMAP to access multiple (different) news servers things
will work wonderfully.

Unfortunately not many places have their IMAP servers configured to allow
Usenet News reading...

Cheers,

The problem will still be there (from what I know)  if you only use the Bcc
field.  What happens is that anyone who you put into the To field will not see
what is in the Bcc field but, anyone in the Bcc field WILL see what is in the
Bcc field. If you can tell everyone (or at least most) to do the following
when they end a message it will work.  What you do is you DO put the list in
the Bcc, Cc, or Lcc field then in the To field put in a ":;" (a colon followed
by a semi-colon) and that will do the trick for you. 

Hope this helps!

If you want to use attachments it's usefull to have files .mime.types and
.mailcap in your home directory. Prototypes are in the Pine distribution.

Edit the files for your need, e.g. in .mailcap is usefull the line for
viewing a hex-dump:

application/octet-stream;  xterm -e /any/directory/view_octet %s ;
test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

where /any/directory/view_octet e.g. holds:

#!/bin/sh

PATH=/any/directory/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
export PATH

TEMP=/tmp/launch.$$
od -bc $1 > $TEMP
EXINIT='set nonu'
export EXINIT
vi -R $TEMP
/bin/rm $TEMP

I hope, this can help you

I am currently enrolled in a class at the University of Tennessee. I have
an e-mail account which you see listed below with my signature. I also
have an account through the State of Tennessee Department of
Education which I access through pine: creasmanr@ten-nash.ten.k12.tn.us; I
have a third account through my local internet access provder:
creasman@cococo.net. To access the University of Tennessee account I have
to call long distance. Is there a way that I can have my UT mail forwarded
to one of my other accounts so that I can view my mail without toll
charges. Thany-you.

RFC822:

message     =  fields *( CRLF *text )
 
If I get it right, it means, that CRLF after headers is part of *body*.
And optional as well.

When I congigure Pine to "enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation" I am able to send
pictures in JPG format from my IBM-compatible computer to a friend with a
MAC computer, who then uses JPEGVIEW to look at the pictures. I believe
this configuration turns off the MIME encoding of the attached pictures
that the MAC could not decode. I would appreciate a description of what is
going on.

If the friend with the MAC computer sent a picture to me, should I have
the configuration set at "enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation" to keep from
MIME-decoding something that has not been MIME-encoded? Again, I would
appreciate a description of what is happening.

Best regards,

Paul Harmeier

My question is, Can the display of the '+' symbol be turned off?  I like
to tage things important '*' and all the '+' signs make it hard to see
the '*'.

In the configuration screen (type M (main menu), S (setup), C (config) the very
first entry should be personal-name (at least is is on Unix, I don't know what
system you are using).  By default the name will be who's ever account you are
using.  If you type A (add) and type in your own name then your name should
appear instead of your father's.

Hope this helps!

I can't seem to choose another string other than the default '> ' with a
space following the indent character... say '| ' or '+ '

This is true even if I try to edit the .pinerc file ...I put the space
there but it disappears later after exiting Pine.  I could do this with an
earlier 3.92 version.  Is this a bug?

I know this may not be completely related to pine:

I want to configure the system so that incoming mail from a particular 
address is automatically directed to a particular folder. I am using Pine 
3.91

Please email me personally (kapur@cbl.ncsu.edu) too as I don't read the 
newsgroup that often.

Thanks...

You can't turn this "lovely feature of Pine3.95" off, because it isn't in
Pine3.95.  This "lovely feature" is in your site's news server.  Some news
servers do this as a matter of administrative policy.

Your reaction of padding your reply with blank lines to defeat this policy
is a common one, but please resist.  It only makes things less pleasant
for everyone else.  You are also likely to annoy the site administrator
who made that policy in the first place; I won't presume to guess what
happens to you when you annoy a site adminstrator in the Navy...

Pine provides you with excellent facilities for editing out unneeded text
from the previous message; please use them.  If you really want to do so,
you could try to persuade your site administrator to turn this "lovely
feature" off in the news server.  We're the wrong people to ask.

Subject: Introduction and Reminder about the Federal Webmasters Workshop
Cc: Martha@incontext.com

Colleagues,

Introduction

Many of you have received email from me in the past, but we have  
just recently added many new addresses to this list, so let me give  
a quick background.  I am working on behalf of the Federal WWW  
Consortium, 15 Federal agencies working together related to the Web.  
 You can find more about the Consortium at  
http://skydive.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

The Consortium is using this mailing list to make announcements  
which we hope are of broad interest to the Federal webmaster  
community. Please contact me if you want to get the word out on  
something which fits that criterion. Announcements which are not of  
broad interest, or are primarily opinion, are not appropriate.

As always, if you want your name removed from this list, or have  
the address of someone who should be added, please contact me at  
lbrandt@nsf.gov. Because of the many new names on the list, you may  
receive this message twice; if so, please let me know which address  
you prefer.

Purpose of this message

Below you'll see an announcement describing the 1996 Federal  
Webmasters Workshop here in the Washington DC area. There are still  
places available so please register if you are interested, and pass  
this message along to colleagues who might be interested.  We have a  
really strong program this year.  Please note that you can register  
at http://skydive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/train/webmaster/wm96/

Also, you may be interested to know that InContext Systems has a  
new CD for Webmasters with full 30 day evaluation copies of their  
InContext Spider and InContext WebAnalyzer software.  Also on the CD  
is trialware versions of ThumbsPlus, Best Web Lite, Adobe Acrobat  
Reader, Map This, Macromedia Shockwave plug-in, and Hitachi  
ZooWorks.  If you would like a free copy of the CD, send e-mail to  
Martha@incontext.com and she will be happy to send you a copy.

========================================
Workshop Theme --

Stepping up to the Challenge -- Putting the Web to Work!

This workshop is packed with sessions that are crucial to the   
developmentand maintenance of Web Services in the Federal Sector.  
There is something in the program for management, as well as  
technical staff... for beginners as well as experts.  Each day will  
start off with an opening session with topics of broad interest,  
followed by a number of concurrent sessions which follow particular  
avenues of interest.  They are:

(100) Management, Oversight and Policy  While publishing  
information via the WWW may be an efficient and effective way to  
deliver information, there are many management and policy issues  
that must be considered.  Sessions on legal issues, privacy,  
customer service, cost recovery and preservation issues will be  
presented.

(200) The Basics  Getting started with World Wide Web Services can  
be a rather daunting proposition for someone new to the WWW.  This  
series of sessions has been designed for novice Web administrators  
and developers.

(300) Supporting Searching on the Web  The key to customer service  
is making it easy to locate relevant information via the Web.  These  
sessions will look at a number of approaches to providing search  
capabilities for users.

(400) Security and Privacy  One of the major concerns in almost every
organization is security issues.  These sessions will focus on Web  
Security Technologies and Solutions, and user buy in to the  
deployment and use of security technologies. There has been a  
specific Question and Answer Session to address participant needs in  
depth.

(500) Server Technology Where is Server Technology going? These  
sessions will examine current server technology,  explore  
integration issues, and discuss performance and platform choices.   
This is a chance for Server Administrators to ask probing questions  
of Server experts.

(600) Federal Showcase A number of Federal Web sites were nominated  
for the showcase..  These session will highlight a number of WWW  
efforts in the Federal Sector.

(700) Technology - Where are we going?  These sessions will include  
Java, Visualization techniques, Collaboration tools - including  
Habanero, Object Oriented Design issues and many other topics.

(800) General Interest Sessions The focus in these session will  
include Intranets, Information Technology Research, Virtual Agencies  
and other topics of interest to the Federal community.

(900) Vendor Product/Tutorial Sessions  A number of commercial  
products will be highlighted in these sessions.

There will also be an expanded exhibit area, scheduled  
demonstrations and Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions.

The organizing committee hopes you will share the excitement we  
found in assembling this program.  Enjoy!

I'm running under Linux Slackware 3.0, the 1.2.13 kernel, and Pine 3.95.
I was wondering if there was a way to get Pine to have mail come from
jasoneng@interl.net, even when I'm logged in as root.

I ended up having to create a 'jasoneng' account which I use only for
reading and posting mail, but I'd like to not have to do that.  I've
messed around with aliases, etc., but I haven't had any luck as of yet.

Thanks in advance,

  Jason

I'm using Pine 3.95 on BSD/OS and Pine 3.91 on Linux

Is there a version of Pine available (or forthcoming) that supports the
widely-used POP3 protocol for retrieving remote mail instead of the
apparently rarely-unused IMAP2 protocol?

If not, has anyone hacked the source to make it POP3 compatable?
If not, can I try? :)

Thanks,
Doug

PS: If you know of another terminal-based mailreader (with source code)
that does support POP3, could you drop me a line? ThanQueue

Sendmail features "don't send a copy to yourself" if you're included in
a mailing-list sort of alias (/etc/aliases) when mailing to that alias.
You can override this behavior if you can manage to specify "-om" ("me,
too") on the sendmail command line.  Not easy, since (most) users use
some friendlier mail interface such as Pine, which then passes along
your mail to sendmail.  [Is this true?]

Another Unix mail program, mailx, lets you set an internal variable
called "metoo."  Though not documented as doing so, mailx seems to pass
"-om" along to sendmail if you've set metoo (perhaps in your .mailrc
file).  Then your own address is not discarded by sendmail when it
expands the alias.

I'd like to know what Unix Pine does about this "me, too" behavior (or
lack of it).  I saw nothing about this in the setup-config screen.

Standard SMTP only supports 7bit characters. That is, ASCII 0-127. This
is because SMTP was originally written to only support plain text
messages.
ESMTP supports 8bit encoding (ASCII 0-255), but not all SMTP servers
support this feature and most people you send to will not be able to
decode the message, if they receive it at all.  8bit encoding is
strongly discouraged on the internet, with MIME being the prefered
method.

MIME encoding converts binary data (like images) into plain text. Each
enclosure or attachment is converted into readable text (usually base64)
and then transmitted as part of the message.  By enabling 8bit ESMTP,
you are disabling the encoding and storing the binary image directly in
the message.  I doubt if it's being MIME encoded when you do this.

You don't need to worry about the format he uses to send you the image.
It won't be MIME decoded unless the message specifically says it is MIME
encoded.

A better solution is for your friend using the MAC to find another email
program that supports MIME, like Netscape 2.0. If he can't do this, then
perhaps he can find a base64 decoder.

I believe Pegasus Mail has a DOS version available, but I doubt if it
works with Internet based mail. It works with LAN based email, like MHS.

DOS-based Internet access is difficult at best to set up, because there
is no standard method for programs to access TCP/IP, such as WINSOCK for
Windows.

If you want your secretary to be able to access an Internet email
account from DOS, the easiest way is to dial directly into the
provider's system (assuming your provider allows dial-in telnet access
instead of just SLIP or PPP, which you are using) using a program like
ProComm. Then, once you are logged in, you can run 'pine' to read & send
email.  You can do this with a simple 2400 baud modem (or even, god
forbid, a 300 baud).  Of course, the mail is never *downloaded* to your
secretary's PC as it is with Eudora. Instead, it stays on the provider's
system.

The way I would go about doing this is to write out a message using a text
editor (such as pico) and then saving it to a file.  Then I would put that
file name in the attachements line so that it would get forced Base64
encoding.  Hope this helps.

Thanks to one and all for the advice.

The solution was....


		rm .newsrc


Then I added the 4 newsgroups that I wanted, and poof.  El-work-o


Thanks for the advice and insight

If you were mailing from your UT account, it looks as though your system
is running Solaris or Sun.  You can easily have your Email forwarded by
putting a .forward file in your home directory.  In that file would be the
Email address where you want your Email forwarded to.  I believe the file
needs to be world readable so to achieve that type chmod 644 .forward at
your shell prompt.  Hope this helps.

On Pine version 3.91 there is a jump command.  To run it, enter the 
letter "J".  Then pine will ask you for a number.  That's it.
You can also config Pine so that if a number is entered in the index of 
a folder it will jump to that number.  Check out your Setup menu for this 
command.

Can anyone explain an inability to post to three newsgroups only(Pine 
3.91 unix) yet one can read these groups? This has only been a recent 
failure. The error message returned is:

[Posting news.....][*Error posting message:  ?3nau
tics-airliners@moderators.uu.net... Address ] 

What might the rest of the error message be saying? (something about the 
address contains...?) The three groups that fail are(another user of the 
service corroborates the failure)

sci.aeronautics
sci.aeronautics.airliners
sci.aeronautics.simulation

I got something like this

 3442 adam      28    0 3456K 1920K sleep   0:00  1.79%  1.79% pine

Is this normal for pine3.95? I ask since I'm running pretty much out of
ram/processes lately.

I think it happens after I open an folder of 9'500 messages and then go
back to folder of size of 25 messages (ie, it get closed). But neverthelss
I think it did not occur before.

It's me that started this one. I received the advice to place the cursor
on the Bcc field, then insert the nickname of the large group (60
addresses) putting nothing in the To: field. I can tell you that it DOES
work (in 3.93) at least with groups; all the recipients see is the group
nickname in the To: field, instead of three pages of addresses, and that
is what I wanted to achieve.

I installed IMAP4 and the problem with empty messages is gone. But it
introduced another one:

now after message was moved form INBOX into $HOME/mail.txt (on IMAPd
host), it is flagged as `SEEN'. Thus, I get no indication which message is
new one. 

The message in mail.txt is flagged as 021; I have no idea what 020 means -
it is not described in pine tech-notes :(

I find this problem to be more annoying as previous and appreciate
any hint about either how to (re-)configure IMAPd or how to patch it. 

The IMAPd version (as reported when telnet'ting on port 143):

* OK itsmx1 IMAP4 Service 8.3(143) at Wed, 31 Jul 1996 10:05:22 +0400
(MOW) (Report problems in this server to MRC@CAC.Washington.EDU)

(done as requested ;))

BTW I *really* would apreciate a patch; 1MB once more seems to be overkill
for what should be a couple of lines worth.

thanks in advance

Create a file in your home directory named .signature and it will
automatically be inserted by Pine.  If you are using Pine 3.92 or later,
you can go to S)etup from the main menu and choose S)ignature to create or
edit it directly from within Pine.

If you are building your own copy of Pine, you can compile it with the
option of changing the From: line in the customized headers section of the
setup.  The switch allowing that is in one of the os_xx.h files.  This is
what I do.  I have a customized header defined as 

	From: "Hiram Lester Jr." <hwlester@pobox.com>

The original sender will still appear in the X-Sender or X-X-Sender line.

To Richard Gering: Thanks for pico man pages. Saved, uncompressed,

To whoever it was who said you couldn't set pico for the delete key to
rubout rather than backspace, the man pages sent me by Richard tell me
that invoking with the -d option will do this. And it does!

Thanks all for advice. What did I ever do without this group????

It is very simple as long as you are using 3.93.  There is a feature in the
config screen called print-index-enabled.  When you select this feature and
are in an index Pine will ask if you want to print the selected message or
index.

hope this helps!

This is nothing at all to do with Pine (or any other mail reading
program).  These are for reading messages AFTER they have been delivered.

Instead you need to persuade whatever mail delivery software is used on
whatever your computer system is to redirect/refile incoming messages
appropriately.

Try finding out whether "procmail" or "filter" is installed on your
computer.  For more information about these (and indeed checking whether
they are available) consult your local support desk.

Cheers,

if you want your list to show your name in your config file at the

that should do the trick for you.

Ummmmm... The original question was about how to jump to a specific line
within the Pico editor (and hence by implication I suspect also within
Pine's internal composer).

What you suggest is simply to allow you to jump to a particular *message*
within a folder's Index screen.

Cheers,

	When you say "routers", if you mean the IP routers which control
network IP traffice....then the answer is, no.  That is because the
routers are operating at the network level and email is up in the
application level.

	If you want to see all the "hops" an email has taken then you
can go to config and  enable-full-header-cmd and then use the "h" key
to see the headers....which records the "hops".

Whilst you can't trace the actual network routing devices, hubs and so
forth your message went through (which, to be honest, you probably don't
want to know anyway) you can probably get more information about any mail
relays/gateways the message went through...

Most of these add a "Received:" header line to the message as it goes
through them.  These stay with the message, and are included when it is
delivered into your INBOX.

However most mail progams, including Pine, suppress these extraneous
headers and just show you the standard ones.

You can see all of the headers by using Pine's "H" (full headers) command
when reading a message.

Note that this command is not normally available by default: you may need
to go into Pine's Setup Configuration screen first and select the
"enable-full-header-cmd".

Cheers,

Hi!

If message is fcc'ed to some folder, it gets flagged as `UNSEEN' (or
rather, is not flagged at all:). If I work on mailing ist, and save my
messages in the list folder, I get many "new" messages, which really are
not new. It prevents me from selecting really new ones by using `;SN'; 
also Pine stops on my first message when opening such folder instead of
jumping to next come.
 
And, logically, if I have written this message, I have seen it at least
once ;-))

Now the questions:

1. Is it intentional?
2. If no, is anybody opposed to flagging such fcc'ed messages as 'SEEN'?
3. If no, I have simple one-line patch to change it. Just replace call to
   `context_append' by call to `context_appen_full' in `write_fcc'
   function.

greetings

Hi, this is probably difficult:

My local Pine accesses remote inbox on our central mailhost via imap; it
works fine. Is there a possibility to read incoming mail from my local Netscape
viewer?

Thank you for comments.

I am using Pine 3.92; I don't know whether the following steps are working
for 3.91. For 3.92:

- 1st you must have an external filter program (from elm or procmail).
  Configure it to copy or move incoming mail to a file.
- 2nd you have to edit your ~/.forward file to pipe incoming mail to the
  filter.
- 3rd configure your Pine: Go to the List Folder Screen (part Incoming
  Message Folders) and use `Add' to specify the file from above (1st) as
  additional incoming message folder.

I hope this helps.

	The Netscape mailer supports POP3.  If your central mailhost
supports POP3 (most likely) you're in....

Wrong, at least to some extend.

What you can do, is to look in the headers (press "H" etc, explained by 
others) for the name of the first machine in the header file, i.e. the
one mentioned at the end (seen from top of message), because the new 
machines are always prepended.  Then you go to your UNIX shell (this works
on SunOS, Solaris, Linux, and others (not so sure about which), and
issue the "traceroute" command.  Syntax is:

	traceroute machine.name

Replace machine.name with the correct one.  Example: My mails come from
"thu@aurora.sgo.fi", so the first machine receiving my e-mail is 
"aurora.sgo.fi" and there's a line in the header saying:

	Received at (time, date) from (somewhere) by aurora.sgo.fi ...

Then you type:

	traceroute aurora.sgo.fi

and then you see, how a telnet, ftp, WWW, mail, whatever connection would 
be routed if you would open one.  It lists your own machine, then the
gateway of your site, then the receiving gateway etc etc etc up to the
host of the sender (provided it is not a modem line or something, the sender
must be on the internet.  Otherwise take the second machine in the list etc,
until you find the first computer with internet access, then trace that.

You get a moderately long list, depending how far away the machine is.  
Finland -> US takes typically some 12 to 17 jumps.  Traceroute also gives
you the response times of those nodes.

It might be, however, that the traceroute program is not installed on your
machine, because it does not come regularly with the OS, as far as I know.
And you cannot simply compile it and run it, because it needs to run "in the
name of root", because it required hardware access (for the timing) to the 
network adapter.  But then go and speak with your admin, he will probably have
it anyway, and tell you how to use it.

Have fun, and as an exercise: trace ME!	:-)

	If you recall....the original question stated:

	"using pine"

	So, I feel "wrong" is an improper conclusion.  Maybe you could
call it "incomplete".

[snip]

> Have fun, and as an exercise: trace ME!	:-)

	You may also wish to point out that it is possible to run 2
traceroutes (one after the other...or even at the same time) and get
2 different results.  This can happen if multiple routes exist in
a network.  And, we can even talk about the data traveling the network
in packets and the fact that one packet may travel one path and other
packets travel other paths and that they can get fragmented....

	Not only that....you may also have to give consideration to
the MX records which were returned....not to mention the randomness
of IP addresses returned when a destination host is multi-homed.

	So, sometimes, you can never be sure exactly what path
some of your packets may have traveled.  :-) :-)

When I have been in newsgroups and tried to post a message, the Pico
program prompts me "do you want to post this message?" When I say yes,
there is a quick message that says "newsgroup not found" and then it exits
me out of the message I was trying to post.

Am I missing a step somewhere?
Thanks.

Hi,
I am using pine 3.91 and would like to specify a local spelling file.

From the pine man page I see that Pine uses the unix "spell" program to check 
spelling.  Spell allows you to specify a local dictionary file:

from the spell man page:
     If a +local_file  argument  is  specified, words  found  in
     local_file  are  removed from spell's output.  local_file is
     the name of a user-provided file that contains a sorted list
     of  words,  one  per  line.   With this option, the user can
     specify a set of words that are correct spellings (in  addi-
     tion to spell's own spelling list) for each job.

Is there a way to tell pine to check a local spell file?

I don't think there is a way to jump once in the editor, but if Pico is
called with a +n where n is a number, it will start with the cursor on
that line.

Actually, the 3rd step depends on personal preferences.  The faq for
procmail just shows using Pine's standard mail/ directory and placing
incoming folders in there.  If you do this, step 3 is entirely
unnecessary.

If you wish to follow step 3, there is actually a little more to it. 
First, you must enable incoming folders in the setup, THEN do the A)dd in
the L)ist folders screen.  For example, mail from this list comes into a
folder called IN.pine-info in the IN.mail/ directory.  I use A)dd folder
and at the host prompt, press return.  At the folder name, I enter
"IN.mail/IN.pine-info" and at the alias prompt I enter "IN.pine-info" 

This second procedure is slightly more complicated, but well worth it
since Pine will allow me to use the Tab key to jump to incoming folders
with new messages automatically (for the most part).

If I attempt to send an email to a nonexistent user on my local

message:

Mail not sent: <baduser@mymachine>... User unknown

Is there a way to turn this off, and force the mail to be sent
(and bounced of course)?

Thanks for any help!

I have tried to enable mouse support via enable-mouse-in-xterm.
The mouse does not allow me to select commands.  It did alter the
cut and paste, but when I hold shift and the middle button to 
select text, it selects backwards.  When I use shift and the left
button, it seems to execute a reply command.

I am running Pine 3.95 on AIX 4.1.4.  It seems to work on a
coworkers machine with the same setup (his machine is at a later
fix level of AIX).

Any ideas? 

Thanks,
Don Warren

    You did not specify in just what context you wanted to do this:
email, Web pages, an ftp library, whatever?  Therefore there cannot be
a single answer to your question.  However, if you are talking about
trying to put fancy features in *email*, PLEASE DO NOT DO IT. 
Generally speaking (unless you are restricting your mailings), you have
no control over what kind of hardware and software your mail recipient
is using.  For some combinations of hardware and software, control
codes imbedded in email can cause major problems for the recipient,
sometimes even causing him/her to lose a session.  Please stick to
ordinary, drab text in email.  If your context is something else, then
that's a different matter.

After PINE 3.95 was installed on my local UNIX server, the index list of
messages is behaving a little differently.

Messages which I originated appear in the index as (example)
"To: comp.mail.pine" instead of "Brian Bell".

What adjustment is needed to make it display the name, the original way?

My provider has just installed 3.94 and there is a new feature that keeps
me from being able to do what I used to be able to do, and am wondering if
there is a way to set something so I can do what I was doing before.

What I like to be able to do is to send someone an address from my address
book.  With 3.91, I could just put the address on the cc: line - then do a
^k - then move the cursor down into the message body and do a ^u to bring
the name and address into the body of the message.  Now - since the header
disappears once you get to the message body - I have no longer been able
to do this.  Is there a way to do what I used to be able to do - using a
different method??

  Turning on enable-8bit-esmtp-nego. doesn't make change in
encoding method of binary attachment like JPEG image. It has to be and is 
encoded in Base64. Most MUA/Pop clients for Mac including Netscape
and Eudora do understanad MIME and have no problem decoding
base64 encoded binary file as well as Binhex and MacBinary I and II.

  'enable-8bit-esmtp...' has nothing to do with what Pine does
with received mail whatever format/encoding it may be in.  If it's in proper
MIME format as it should be (pls, note that MIME(and MacMIME
for sending both data and resource fork) is the standard while
Binhex although popular among Mac users is supposed to be phased out).
You may ask your friend to send his file in (Mac)MIME instead of
Binhex. Most modern MUA/Pop/IMAP clients for Mac support (Mac)MIME,
so that your friend should not have any problem with encoding
binary files in (Mac)MIME. In case you receive BinHex file,
you can decode it after saving to a file with 'Wincode' or
'Stuffit Expander' for MS-Windows. There's a binhex decoder
for Unix as well. Try the FAQ of comp.sys.mac.comm for
whereabout of those en/decoders and various file formats
to transfer Mac files with data and resource forks.

It is now 1 August (in this part of the world) and I have answered the
question "Move sent-mail to sent-mail-jul-1996" with Yes. But now every
time I open PINE it keeps asking me "To save space delete folder
sent-mail-jul-1996". I keep saying No but it keeps asking again at the
start of each session. What's gone wrong?

MIME is interoperable throughout the world.

Raw 8bit, without MIME, is not.  Your 8bit messages in French will show up
as unreadable in Russia, Greece, Japan, China, Taiwan,...

This is because there is effectively only one 7bit system in the world,
ASCII; whereas there are many 8bit systems.  Of course, ASCII is not
suited to languages which use non-Roman scripts, or even to Roman script
language which use diacritical marks (such as French).  A secondary
problem is that not all mailers on the Internet are 8bit capable and the
standards only require 7bit capability.

That's why MIME was created.  MIME provides a framework for identifying
all of the world's languages; and it also provides a framework for passing
8bit data on a 7bit network.

There isn't any configuration needed.  A Unix pathname as the mailbox 
name -- e.g. {imap.server.com}/usr/blurdybloop/sarasoop -- works fine.
