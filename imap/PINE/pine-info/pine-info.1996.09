Hello. I'm running Pine 3.9.1 on AIX 3 for IBM risc/6000.

anyway, is there anyway way for pine to display the "Message-ID"
in the header?  

if i need that sort of information, i usually have to use regular
'mail' or "more" the mail file.

Thanks.

You might want to check out comp.lang.perl.modules .  Whether or not
you actually write the whole thing in Perl  (which looks as though it
would be an option),  I vaguely remember various modules to do many of
those things (don't know about CRON under Win3.X, though).  Perl
modules are (nearly) always provided in source code format.

Hope this helps.

I wish to use pine (3.91, linux) to access a mailbox on a remote host using

appropriately specify this for the inbox-path variable ?

Weird...

I've been using the Net for quite a few years now and have to admit that I
have never before heard of the "space after the -- in a signature"
requirement before.

I wonder how many others have?

As an aside, I would dispute Sven's suggestion that this form is a
*requirement*.  It is certainly _optional_ (messages are still delivered
if the "-- " line is not present:-) and even then I would say merely a
courtesy to others.

Cheers,

I think "DearOldDad"'s somewhat terse reply could perhaps benefit from a
small amount of elaboration...

Pine allows you to alter its behaviour in a great many (and ever
growing:-( number of ways.  These are accessed, perhaps unsurprisingly,
from a menu item called "SETUP" on the Main Menu.  After selecting this
and then "Configuration" (as against "Printer", for example) you get to
the famous but apparently little discovered "Setup Configuration" screen,
where all the innards can be controlled.

Looking through the various options available reveals one called
"signature-at-bottom" (which looks promising?).

It is at _this_ point you can put your cursor on this variable and press
"?" to see the on-line help about it.

I had the same problem with Pine 3.91. With 3.95 it seems to works, even if it asks for pwd EVERY TIME you change group, so I really can't use Pine for news. ;-(

This is probably a dumb question, but...
when I post to a newsgroup (say, for example, this one), the index shows
"To: alt.test" instead of my email address.  How do I change this so that
people can see that the post is from me?!?!

Thanks for your help.

Other people see exactly the right thing.

Pine is merely helping you (and you alone) by providing you a little more
information than could otherwise be displayed.  Instead of just saying

	Your name

as the sender (which you already know!) it displays

	"To: recipient's name"

This is ONLY done on YOUR screen when you display the folder's contents;
everyone else has seen exactly the right thing in the message/article you
sent out.

The "To:" *implies* the message is from yourself, and the extra space is
used to show who you sent the message to.  In general this extra
information is more useful than merely listing your own name and leaving
you to guess/remember who you sent this particular message to.

It's a shame that so few people appreciate it! :-)

The one thing that stops me from swapping from my slower than slow PC
driven Pegasus mail to pine on unix is the fact that I can't find a way to
get pine to automatically give me a cc of my out going e-mails. Is there
an option other than having to type my own address into the cc everytime I
send an e-mail ??

Look in Pine's Setup Configuration screen for an item called
"default-fcc".  You can read about it by putting the cursor on it and
typing "?".

You can override this default value for the fcc (File Carbon Copy) field
when composing a message by putting the cursor on a header line, typing ^R
to see the Rich Headers, and then blanking the now automatically filled in
Fcc header field value.

You can also override the default for individuals listed in your address
book by setting up an Fcc entry in there for them.

Cheers,

I have seen a few post asking about viewing pictures with pine. Never did
see any replys (probably in FAQ). But where is FAQ? How do I get there?
Other wise, how do I view with abouve set-up?

Subject: Multiple simultaneous IMAP sessions
Date: Sun, 01 Sep 1996 16:44:14 GMT
Message-Id: <3229bd23.10924463@news.interaccess.com>

I'm in a situation where multiple people need to be able to manipulate
mail for a single account simultaneously from a remote system. IMAP4
looks like its the way to go but I have a few questions. I found the
following info in the IMAP mailing list archives regarding multiple
logins considering each IMAP session starts a server(daemon) proccess:

>If the second IMAP server has read/write access to the folder, it will steal
>the access rights from the first IMAP server and send the first IMAP server a
>signal (called "kiss of death") which instructs it to consider the folder
>readonly for the remainder of the session.  The idea is that an abandoned or
>forgotten IMAP server should relinquish control to a new server; in the past,
>the first IMAP server held on to read/write access rights and would not permit
>the second IMAP server to get it.
[snip]
>The solution to this conumdrum is to use a different format, one designed to
>permit multiple simultaneous access.  The UW version 4.0 imapd supports no
>less than 5 alternative mailbox formats (3 in the version 3.6 imapd

>capability), and MX (an advanced successor to MH, with full IMAP4 capability).

My questions are as follows:

Currently, I'm running  qmail as my MTA. Is there any way to get qmail
to convert incoming mail to one of the above listed formats that will
handle multiple simultaneous access or will I need to change my MTA?
If I need to change my MDA, where can I find one that can handle any
of the above listed formats that will handle multiple simultaneous
access? Are there any IMAP clients for Windows with a "pretty
interface" for the people to use that will understand any of the above
format?  Is there possibly a better IMAPD and/or system to use
overall? My key needs in order of priority are: efficient/effective
MTA, auto-responder capabilities depending on message header/content,
multiple remote simultaneous access, and "pretty interface" mail
client.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

    I had heard of it before.  In order to be a "signature" in the
esoteric technical sense, it has to begin with two hyphens followed
by a blank, the three to be left-justified on a line by themselves. 
However, Pine will cheerfully include whatever you have in your
$HOME/.signature file, whether it meets this requirement or not.

    I suppose it may depend on what Sven means by a requirement.  I
simply consider my so-called signature to be the bottom part of my
text, conveniently and automatically added for me by Pine.  However,
some people may be using software to preprocess incoming mail.  That
preprocessing may include some kind of manipulation of the signature 
in the above technical sense.  If that is so, then "signatures" which
do not begin with '-- ' will possibly not be caught by the prepro-
cessor, rather to the frustration of the recipient.

    However, I am not aware that there is any RFC requirement that
there be a signature at all on email, and often, email generated from
Web pages have no signature in the technical sense, but they are still
delivered.

I had also "heard" if before, but when I challenged the informant for
chapter and verse, they merely told me they "knew" that this was the
rule.  So I was, and apparently we all still are, unaware of who makes
this rule and where it is documented.

Quite so.  My only real reason for following-up is in an attempt
to provoke someone into "naming their source".

Go to Setup/Config and see what the value for "composer-wrap-column" 
is.  If it's 0 or if it's set wider than what your screen can display, 
there's your problem.  A good rule of thumb, IMO, is to set it from 74 to 
78 since most users operate at a width of 80 columns.  Hope this helps!

Probably is right, but i suppose it should be covered in the FAQ.  If you
log into a friends account you will see that it does show your name.  Mail
or posts that are from you are shown in the index with the To: header.
Just look in your sent-mail folder - its the same way in there.

I have one particular problem that really bugs me.  It drives me nuts 
actually and has ever since I started with Pine.  Say I am writing a 
message, probably a few paragraphs.  So I type away.  Now I look back and 
decide I want to insert a couple lines in the middle of the first 
paragraph.  So I cursor up there and type that.  But it doesn't work.  
The line I'm typing on just insists on getting longer (with a $ at the 
end), and doesn't wrap around.  So this really gets to be a chore!

I have to cursor over to the end of the line, hit Return, and then set 
about adjusting each following line in that paragraph so that it looks 
nice and proper with ~70 char's per line.

Why does Pine do this to me?  And why can't it work like a fairly 
"half"-decent wordprocessor?  The editor I'm using is Pico.

Just edit the .signature file with your favourite editor (I use Emacs 
for instance, you may use Pico, VI or something else) writing the signature
into it as plain ASCII. All done!

Yes, there's a flag in PINE Setup (or at least it is in Pine 3.95). It is
called quell-dead-letter-on-cancel... set it to ON.

I should make a correction.  You can set the margin any width you want.  
It's just a good idea to not exceed 80 columns.  Sorry for the slight 
confusion.  Best regards.....

There is no "requirement" of the _existence_ of a signature.  However,
there is a longstanding practice, when including one, of prefacing it
with the "-- " line.

Well, MY original source was various documentation surrounding trn and
elm, but I did find some acknowledgement of this practice elsewhere.
See section 4.3.2 of "Son of RFC 1036":
  ftp://ftp.zoo.toronto.edu/pub/news.txt.Z

#	[...]
#          If  a  poster or posting agent does append a signature to an
#          article, the signature SHOULD be preceded with  a  delimiter
#          line  containing  (only)  two hyphens (ASCII 45) followed by
#          one blank (ASCII  32).
#	[...]
#                                                                A
#               standard  delimiter  line  makes  it  possible for
#               reading agents to handle signatures  specially  if
#               desired.    (This  is  unfortunately  hampered  by
#               extensive misunderstanding of, and misuse of,  the
#               delimiter.)
#
#               NOTE: The choice of delimiter is somewhat unfortu-
#               nate, since it relies on preservation of  trailing
#               white  space,  but  it  is too well-established to
#               change.
#	[...]

Note that this document is specifically written for USENET news posts,
not email, but the rationale behind the "-- " delimiter is as valid
for email as for news.

Ummm... I don't actually recall seeing such a question go by recently
(but then I confess I have been somewhat snowed under with other things).

The description below assumes you are using (the current) version 3.95 of
Pine on UNIX.  I don't use PC-Pine myself but believe things to probably
be configurable in a similar way; however filenames etc will be different.

Method 1
--------
At Pine's Main Menu type "S" (Setup) then "C" (Configuration) to get to
the Setup Configuration screen.  Look down for a variable called
"image-viewer", put your cursor on it, and type "?" to read the on-line
help about it.

Method 2 (preferred nowadays)
--------
Set up a personal "Mailcap" file (or ask your system manager to set one up
systemwide.  This file contains information on the command to use to view
an attachment of a particular MIME type.  It is more flexible than the old
"image-viewer" variable described above, as you can use different viewers
to view different formats of image.

If you need assistance setting up a mailcap file try asking your local
support desk.

> But where is FAQ? How do I get there?

The FAQ is available on the World-Wide Web at the Pine Information Centre:

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/

> Other wise, how do I view with abouve set-up?

I'm not sure what the "above setup is", as I said above.  The instructions
I summarised will work for UNIX Pine, and probably (in some shape or form)
for PC-Pine.  However if you're referring to an Amiga (in the Subject
line) then I have no specific information I can give.

Cheers,

In a fit of early morning madness I present for your delectation this
momentary diversionary tale from someone at my church.  Please forgive me
the normally unpardonable sin of wandering slightly but it is, perhaps, in
some sense relevant...

-----
A little girl had for some years watched her mother prepare the joint of
beef for their family's traditional Sunday dinner.  The girl had long
wondered why her mother always cut off an inch-wide slice from the end of
the joint and threw it away before putting the remainder in the oven.

One day she plucked up her courage and asked her mother why she did this.

Her mother stopped, looking non-plussed, and admitted that she really
didn't know why, but did it because _her_ mother had always done so.

So when they next visited the little girl's grandmother they asked her why
she had always cut the end inch off the Sunday joint.  She replied, "Back
when I got married we had a house with a very small kitchen, which had a
very small cooker.  We had to use a small roasting tin to fit in the oven,
and the joint of meat was always a little to big to fit onto it so I had
to trim the end of it off."
-----

Ummm... it sounds like there may be something funny with your setup...

Question: Are you really using Pico (the separate standalone editor
invoked either manually or automatically from Pine as the "alternate
editor"), or using Pine's built-in composer (which is Pico in disguise).

You can tell by starting to compose a message and, the cursor in the
Message Text area, looking at the header line at the top of the screen.
If this looks something like this:

PINE 3.95L   COMPOSE MESSAGE REPLY               Folder: INBOX 53 Messages

Then you're using Pine's built-in composer and I'm confused by what you
report you're seeing.  Let me elucidate...

Pine's built-in composer certainly does word-wrap if you go back and add
text to an existing line in a paragraph.  However the word-wrapping is
limited in that:

	*  Words are pushed off thee line onto a new line inserted after
	   the current one (ie, they aren't added to and rewrapped into
	   subsequent lines).

	*  Deleting words from a line does not "suck back" words from the
	   subsequent lines.

This is primarily because the composer (and standalone Pico's word wrap
mode) is a text editor, not a full-blown word processor.

Word-wrapping in this manner is the default action for both Pine's
built-in composer (Pico in disguise) and standalone Pico.  For the latter
the action can be suppressed by starting it with the "-w" command line
option, which will then give the effect you describe.

This tends to make me think that you're not using Pine's built-in
composer, but instead invoking Pico with a "pico -w" command setup either
in your own personal configuration or in your system's systemwide Pine
configuration file.  Check your Setup Configuration screen for the value
(if any) set up for the "editor" variable.

Finally... both Pico and Pine's built-in composer offer a very handy
command that justifies (re word-wraps) the current paragraph.  This is ^J
(shown in the command menu at the bottom of the screen).

Just put your cursor on the untidy paragraph and type ^J for it to be
rewrapped.  (A "paragraph" is a sequence of lines delimited either by
blank lines or a line with leading whitespcae.)

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

One way is to use a text editor (not Pine, which is a mail program) to
create a file called ".signature" in your home directory.  If you don't
know what editors are available to you, or how to use them, you will need
to ask your local support desk.

However if you are using the latest version of Pine (3.95 -- it tells you
up at the top left corner of your screen when you're within Pine) there is
a built-in signature editor...

At the Main Menu type "S" (Setup) followed by another "S" (Signature).

This action has been deliberately chosen by the Pine Team.  The reasoning
is that the text of your reply is (should be!) the "useful" part of the
message, and the quoted text of secondary nature to provide context for
the recipient if they can't remember what it is you're waffling on about
;-)  This saves the recipient having to wade through reams of included
text simply to get to your comments right at the bottom.

Therefore the default action is to let you start typing your reply in
straight away, all nicely position at the start of the message.

However for dinosaurs who really don't like the behaviour (gosh, I'm in a
funny mood today:-) or for those who prefer to intersperse their comments
after included paragraphs the action can be changed...

At Pine's Main Menu go to the Setup Configuration screen (by typing "S"
then "C") where, unsurprisingly, you can set Pine's behaviour.  Look down
the list of items for one called "signature-at-bottom" and make sure it is
selected.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

You should:

- look at the available newsgroups. c.m.pine is not the right one. Try
  comp.mail.misc instead (Followups set to it),

- look into the documentation, the mailing list is mentionned here. It was
  on Dan's announce for Qmail too I think.

Dear Sir,

This is my first try to use Email so I have confused in using Pine.  First
of all , I have some questions to use and would like you to advise me as
below :

	1.Pine is text mode only , isn't it?
	2.Can I save my inward mail to my hardisk? How to do it?
	3.What is the meaning of "Folder" in Email? and
	  How many folder can I create?

Thank you very much for your kind assistance and look forward your early
reply.

Thanks and best regards,

Well, in the true tradition of Unix help: I can't tell you the answer,
but I can tell you how to find it, and I don't think you need it.

Where does each user's pine store state between invocations?  In the
".pinerc" file (or the equivalent PC file).  That would be the place
to check.  My guess is that it's the "last-version-used" variable.
Experiment with that, and either distribute appropriately jiggered
.pinerc files, or (if it works) diddle the systemwide .pinerc file
(again, if on a Unix system).

But...  I see a more fundamental problem.  If you think your email
system may not be able to handle one message per day per user, I think
you need to rethink your email strategy, not the intro-message-mailing
strategy.  I'm not sure how useful an email system can be if it is
stressed by that load.

Good luck!

-Dean

To Pine Info members:

A few weeks ago, S.M. Masieh ul Islam posted a message asking for help in
printing email messages.  I asked him for more information, and I think he
has provided enough information that someone can answer his question.

He is running in a DOS/Windows environment with a Canon BJC-210 attached
to his PC.  He is dialing in to the Pakistan Telecommunication Corp. 
PARKNET service via modem and, presumably, Windows Terminal program, to
run Pine.

Can the Windows program be configured to recognize the print-through
commands?  Is there another Windows telecommunications program he can
buy/download that is compatible with the print through commands?  Is there
some other way he can print his messages, short of saving to a file and
downloading via xmodem, kermit, etc. 

Regards,

Don Sugarman

I've seen commercial terminal emulation apps that can do
this, but I can't remember the names of them.  Flipping
through any software mag ought to get you some candidates.
You should, of course, ask the vendor if their product
supports this behavior before buying.  Alternatively, he
should be able to use the windows terminal emulator to print
the screen, no?

Good luck.

Subject: telling PINE my PPP is down
Reply-To: luomat@nerc.com
Organization: Princeton Theological Seminary


Occasionally my PPP connection dies at times when I am running PINE  
(usually to read news off a remote NNTP machine).

Then it just hangs there for a LONG time, and finally says "Waited  
for server for X seconds, hangup?"

Where X seconds is not as long as it really has been waiting....

Anyway, where is this time-to-ask-if-pine-should-break-connection set?

Thanks

Yes, many MUAs, including elm, let you change the `From:' header.
With pine you need to recompile it so that ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM is
not commented out.

Good luck,

Hello!

Is there any "auto mail forwarding" function in pine.  If it is, then how

Hi John, There is no need to do anything I guess. I was told that everyone
else can see the name "John O. Stambaugh" <jos@gate.net>
but we can't see our own names. Take care, Jon.
PS If you want to see your own name then ask this group again but be

Tony,

One of our user services people at UW is preparing a long document
describing how to do Japanese mail reading with Pine.  It's still in
preliminary state and has known errors, so I don't know if she wants to
let it out yet.  But I've bcc'd her on this message; if she wants to send
you a copy on a "use at your own risk" basis that'd be her decision...

ISO-2022-JP is simply mixed ASCII (English) and JIS (Japanese) text in 7
bits, using ESC codes to shift back and forth between them.  Your terminal
emulator may support this encoding as "JIS7". 

Pine does not do too well with ESC codes.  Each ESC code occupies three
bytes, which Pine thinks occupies screen space even when it doesn't.  For
this reason, I usually convert the data to 8-bit code (either EUC or SJIS)
using the display-filter functionality along with the "nkf" program (if
you do serious work with Japanese on Unix, you probably have a copy of
nkf).

You may need to do some experimentation to get it working, and you should
also be sure that you're using the latest version of Pine.  Earlier
versions of Pine have known problems working with Japanese text.

For more information about Japanese encodings and the nkf program, I refer
to you to Ken Lunde's book "Understand Japanese Information Processing".

Subject: pine.conf and location of sendmail binary
Date: 22 Aug 1996 19:26:06 GMT
Message-Id: <4vic8e$ml9@mule.fhcrc.org>

I installed Pine, tried to send a message, and received an error to the
effect that Pine couldn't find /usr/lib/sendmail.  Aha! I thought, I
know what the problem is:  I've moved sendmail to /opt/local/sbin.  So
I created /opt/local/lib/pine.conf, consisting of the single line:

sendmail-path=/opt/local/sbin/sendmail

Tried sending the message again, and Pine (apparently) sent my test
message just fine.

But in fact, Pine is actually tossing mail into the bit bucket.  Copies
are saved to sent-mail, of course, but the message itself vanishes.

I've run Pine under truss and stared at the output.  I can see the call
to /opt/local/sbin/sendmail.

I hard-linked /usr/bin/sendmail to /opt/local/sbin/sendmail.  Same
problem.

I then removed /opt/local/sbin/pine.conf.  Bingo!  Things work again.

OK, so is this a bug or am I missing something?  And can anyone
describe the details of how this fails?  Clearly,
/opt/local/sbin/sendmail gets called ... but it tosses the message,
instead of sending it.  I don't understand how this can be --
sendmail's behavior at this point should be unrelated to any weirdness
on Pine's part.

Hi,
I hope there's someone out there who can give me some direction on what to
try or perhaps have had this problem...

I have the 3.95 version of Pine to install (hopefully). I have MkLinux for
Power Macintosh (running on OSF-RI MACH 3.0) Linux 1.2.13 running on my
machine. 

The build for pico stops dead with:
cc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11
make: *** [osdep.o] Error 1

and my syslog dir has this message:
error: cannot execute /usr/bin/rsmtp: No such file or directory

Ok, I know I don't have rsmtp, but I haven't seen where I'm supposed to
get that util. And I can't find in the Pine files where I can edit out
the call to that or change it as well.

Any ideas on getting around this? Get a Pico binary and edit out the build
line for it?
Thanks in advance,
Parri Gignac

We are providing an internet service to a number of vision impaired people
who dial up via modem and can access a Pine mailbox and services such as
lynx and telnet. 

I have been asked "is there an off line reader which would work with
Pine". My answer was, no I don't think so - but I thought I should ask all
you "out there" in case I'm wrong. We are running Pine 3.95 under SCO 4.2
... Clients generally use telix or procomm for terminal emulation.

    There is none in Pine.  Mail forwarding is not Pine's job.  That 
is part of the delivery process, and Pine comes into the picture only
after the mail is delivered.  Despair not, however.  If you are using
Pine on a Un*x system, you can set up a .forward file to have your mail
forwarded.  For more elaborate information, read 'man forward'.  If you
are running Pine on some other system, others more knowledgeable than I
will have to provide you with information.

Hi,

Has anyone had problems using pine (3.95) on solaris 2.5.1 x86?

Specifically when using pine to send mail via smtp, my machines
lockup and need to be rebooted.

I've tried this to no avail...it DOESN'T work!  As for DearOldDad, I 
wonder
if he has anything better to do than reply to everyone with RTFM?

Thanks for explaining the technique to me, but I already tried these 
options.

I have appreciated ;-) this feature since old version 3.05, which
I've just swapped for 3.91.  In my recently saved messages, I
still get 'To:..' but my older messages suddenly just showed 
my name as the sender.

Upon investigating, I found out that pine 3.91 is putting 
straight <lmckay@nla.gov.au> in the 'From:' of recent messages,
but the earlier version used the $NAME environment variable
which had 'L.McKay', so 'From:' had <L.McKay@nla.gov.au> (an
alias happily recognised on my system for returns).

Pine now thinks I am <lmckay@nla.gov.au>.
Consequently, Pine does not know I wrote the old messages.

I've looked at all the new configurable options, but cannot
find one that lets me customise what Pine puts in 'From: '.
I'd like to use $NAME environment variable again, but have
not yet found any documentation that the ability to use it 
ever existed.  Was it a proper feature of Pine 3.05 or would 
it have just been implemented on our site (and how)?

Thanks,
Leanne.

Yes, this is what I do.  I use .signature for most programs and .sig--
for pine.  Here's a script I use to edit my sig, which I call `editsig':


  #! /bin/sh
  # The above line means that this is a Bourne shell script.

That's something that you'd do in VMS, e.g in your LOGIN.COM or
in the system-wide counterpart, you'd add:

$ DEFINE PINE_MAIL_PROTOCOL SMTP

However, I got better results by taking the other option, and having
the PINE client send its mail by making an SMTP connection to the
SMTP server (even though it was on the same machine).  This may be 
less efficient, but it works for me.  I haven't messed with that for
a while, and my recollection is getting dim, but try 

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/vms-pine.html

for some notes I made at the time.

Hi!
	I currently use Pine to read my mails. From using Tin I know that 
it is possible to thread messages so that all the messages on a 
particular topic appear together. 
	I am teaching a course this semester and am going to teach my 
students the Pine. I was wondering if it may be possible for them to 
thread the messages using Pine. Can you please tell me if the facility 
exists in either Pine or in Netscape. Thanks.

If you decide to use my `editsig' script, this first line needs 
to start in column 1 and *not* indented like I posted it.  I.e.,
the first line should look like this:

#! /bin/sh

Sorry if the way I posted it was confusing.

Whilst Pine can't do "true threading" (by looking at articles' "Xref:"
headers and working out which articles were replies to which others) it
can approximate it (probably closely enough for your needs).

The trick is, once you open a newsgroup, to use Pine's Sort command to
order the articles by "Ordered Subject".  This sorts them first by subject
text and then, where these are the same, date and time of submission.

You do this by typing the two keystrokes:

	$ O

Note that you will have to do this for every folder you open, as it only
affects the current index display; it does not remember the sorting for
the future.

If you wish you can alter the default sort order from Arrival to Ordered
Subject in Pine's Setup Configuration screen.  However this default order
affects ALL your folders: Usenet News and ordinary (mail).  For ordinary
folders sorting by Arrival is often preferred, so you may want to think
about which folders you will be opening more often and set the default
sort order to be the best for those.  This will minimise the number of
times you have to use the "$" (Sort) command.

Cheers,

Hi!

I'm looking for compiled (I would prefer that) version of PINE 3.95 for

Any help would be very appreciated.

This is an automated response to your Pine[R] bug report.  The purpose of
this message is to: 1) acknowledge receipt of your report, 2) apologize in
advance for the fact that you may not receive any other response to it,
and 3) tell you how to get more information or help. 

Pine is now used by literally millions of people around the world, and
thousands more every day.  Not surprisingly, the number of messages sent
to our "pine-bugs" address has become enormous.  Since we receive no
funding to support anyone outside the University of Washington, it is no
longer possible to answer all of them individually.

Other sources of help:

 o In addition to Pine's context-sensitive internal help text, also read
   the Release Notes (the R command on the Main Menu.)

 o Check out the Pine Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list.  To get a
   copy by email, simply REPLY to this message, or send any message to:
        pine-faq@docserver.cac.washington.edu

 o Check with your local support staff.  If you are not sure how to
   contact them, try sending a very polite note to "postmaster"
   on your system, asking that your inquiry be directed to the help desk.

 o If you can't get any help from your local support staff (or you
   *are* the local support staff), consider sending a message to the
   world-wide "pine-info" email list at:
         pine-info@cac.washington.edu
   or post to the comp.mail.pine newsgroup (pine-info and comp.mail.pine
   are linked together, so there is no need to both send email and post).
   Your message will be seen by thousands of Pine users and system
   administrators, one of whom may have just the information you seek.

 o If you are handy with FTP or WWW tools, you may find some useful
   documentation on our Pine Information Center servers:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

 o If you really, *really* need to get in touch with the Pine development
   team directly, send a message to:
         pine@cac.washington.edu
   However: please try all the other alternatives first, and understand
   that because so many people are now sending messages to that address
   as well --many of which are inquiries that could be answered by reading
   the documentation or FAQ-- it is no longer possible for us to respond
   to all of them.


Note that we get many questions that are not actually about Pine. In case
your inquiry concerns programs such as talk, chat, or IRC, or problems
with disk space on your system, or with unknown/invalid email addresses,
please contact your local computer support staff.  However, we still
welcome actual bug reports and suggestions.

With sincere apologies for this impersonal response,

There exist separate small programs to do that. Check if your system has
the handy frm (and check 'man frm' or 'frm -h' for information on the
several command line options). It is a good idea to activate this at
login with a line in the .login -file. By the way, frm is from the elm
team...

Thank you to all who answered. That's the solution: I changed the option
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM in the file pine/osdep/os-lnx.h and then recompiled
the binaries. Then I added a proper "From:..."-header to the customized
headers. Seems to work fine.

NOT TRIVIAL AT ALL. TRY ^W THEN ^V  WILL TAKE YOU TO THE END OF THE DOC.
^W IS THE SEARCH MODE WHEN COMPOSING. WHEN READING IT SHOULD DO TO JUST
TYPE W WITHOUT THE CONTROL KEY
GOOD LUCK

^W then either ^V (to move to the end) or ^Y (to move to the top).

You can't with Pine 3.91.  In Pine 3.95, use something like

	inbox-path={server.domain/user=foo}INBOX

Another way to add a signature with "-- " prepended is to configure
the following script as a sending-filter:

=09#!/bin/csh
=09cat
=09echo "-- "
=09cat ~/.signature
=09
You will also want to unset the "signature-file" in the setup/Config
screen.  If you select the compose-send-offers-first-filter feature,
it will automatically be added by default when you send each message.
It would be trivial to extend this script to add random sigs, etc.
Note that this will always add the sig at the bottom of the message
(even forwarded messages)  regardless of the signature-at-bottom
feature setting.=20

Hiya, there've been a few notes about filter passed through here -- in
reference to kill files mostly, I'm just wondering what I have to do to
get filter to work on the mail I read with pine.

My mail is collected via a POPCLIENT script, from my ISP.

Anyone who knows how to set filter up (ie setup a rule to delete certain
messages), please get in touch :-)

Regards,

Pine does not allow composer-wrap-column to be over 80 characters
(unless you re-compile with a higher limit...)

Message-Id: <mponsfor-0409961439250001@bronte.library.uvic.ca>

I'm attempting to setup a form letter so that the subject header and main
body are predefined. I want it such that all the pine user need do is
enter the recipient email address and send it.

The main body of text is simply the signature file. No problem there. But
in trying to predefine the subject header, no luck.

I went into the configuration section of PINE 3.9.3 and tried setting a
customized-hdr value for the subject header. When I compose a new message,
the assigned value is visible in the subject header. Everything appears to
be OK, and then I send the message. Unfortunately, when the recipient
reads the email, the subject header info is blank.

Any ideas?

In Pine 3.92 or later, go to the Addressbook screen, move the cursor
to the distribution list, and Forward it.  If the recipient is using
Pine 3.92 or later, they can View the attachment, then TakeAddr to
drop the list in their addressbook...

There is a bug in Solaris 2.5 STREAMS that causes a system hang and
which Pine 3.95 can trigger.  I don't know if Sun has come out with a
fix yet, but the following Pine patch has been proposed by Bo Kullmar
<Bo.Kullmar@abc.se>.  It is reported to work for some people and not
for others...

I sometimes have the need to Export my entire addressbook instead of just
an entry at a time.  I know that I could just copy my .addressbook file
and use that, but it isn't formated in any way.  I would have to add
spaces to all my addresses when I'm in my word processor.  Is it possible
to have it output similar to how it outputs when I choose the Print
command?

I don't know too much about compilers, but perhaps you want to try a
different one? Unless I am mistaken (not unlikely, sorry to say) cc1 runs
as part of the cc compiler. Perhaps you could edit the build or makefiles
to use gcc instead...?

Is there a way to also specify the password on that line? ie,
inbox-path={mail.server/user=foo/password=bar)INBOX ?

I upgraded my Linux kernel to 2.0.x series, and along with that I
got Pine 3.93 running.  This was from a fresh Slackware re-install
from a perfectly working 1.2.13 kernel.  No when I download my 
email via popclient, my Pine shows a:

1			[ No text in this message ]

Or something similar to that, for EACH message that I receive.  No 
other users on my computer have this problem.  Incoming mail straight
through my sendmail does not do this, and neither does downloading the
email to a different computer (via same POP server).

Any ideas here?  TIA, cc's via email really appreciated..

How to set your "From:" field in pine without having ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM
set in the pine3.91/pine/osdep/os-XXX.h file? 

Postpone your e-mail, edit ~/mail/postponed-msgs to set your "From:" field
as desired and load the message back into pine. 

Will happily use the new "From:" entry. Bug or feature?

No, cc1 does "run" as part of gcc.  I would not be surprised if
cc was softlinked to gcc under MkLinux as it is under most other
Linux distributions.  

Something that may help with sig11 problems is to look at:

Dear PINE developping team and/or expert user,
is there a way in PINE to insert a file (eg, just a simple piece of text)
while composing a message, not as an attachement, but as a text in the
message itself, which can be then modified as usual in PINE???
Probably it's a very trivial thing, but I'm am quite new with PINE use 
and I appreciate greatly your help for this little problem.
Best regards,
             Marta Felcini

    Good Lord, why would you want to do this?  You might as well go ahead
and write your password on a post-it note and leave it on your monitor.
Or better, on a public terminal somewhere (don't forget your account name
and machine name too).

    The only use I could see for this (and I have wanted it for this
reason) is for anonymous IMAP login, specified as /user=anonymous and you
enter your e-mail address as password.  Otherwise, anyone could read your
password on the other system from your pinerc file.  You don't want that,
do you?

When you're composing your message/reply and have the cursor in the

I do not know 3.05 but I suppose thi sfeature was removed due to a
risc that some users might fake their From: addresses. If you upgrade to
3.95 (a few months old version -- the newest one) than you can set
alternative addresses you want to be recognized by pine as yours.

Another reason for changing to the new version is the ability to decode
RFC 1522's encoding thus seeing my name in From: properly :-)

I run Pine under unix on a remote system, to which I am connected by
telnet.  I have just discovered that if I hit Y, Pine will print the 
current message (or index), on my local printer.  That's wonderful!
Thank you.

I would run Pine locally too, on my OS/2 system, but our firewall won't
transmit IMAP packets, only ftp and telnet.  :-(  

The printing feature above makes this difficulty much more livable-with.

I am also using the ability to invoke Kermit for down/up loading of
files and messages, which is also great.  I haven't worked out how to
get Kermit to use APC calls when invoked by Pine: has anyone?

Dominik

			Hello,

	We are running unix pine 3.95 as imap client on both sunOS 4.1.3
and Solaris 2.5. Our IMAP server is a P133 under FreeBSD. We are facing
the following problem :

	We have tried the 2 following syntaxes in .pinerc on client side :

1.	inbox-path={imap.domain.fr/user=chris}inbox

2.	inbox-path={[192.45.233.7]/user=chris}inbox


	On client side under SunOS, with the first syntax, we need about
30 seconds until we get the password prompt ( message 'Opening "INBOX"' ).
With the second syntax, it's very quick ( 1 second or 2 ).

	On client side under Solaris, opening the mailbox is very slow (
about 30 seconds ) with both syntaxes in .pinerc !...

	Certainly a problem with name resolving on client and/or server
side ?... Has anyone already faced this problem ? Any idea ?...

	Thanks for your help.

Thanks to the unknown with his slow imap connections (mail lost in
excitement...).

I moved all symbolic hostnames out of my pinerc and substituted them with
internet numbers, and inbox scan is as fast as hell....

I'm trying to read the Microsoft newsgroups 
from a UNIX box where I 
have little disk space 
and less permissions.  
Pine seemed like the 
easy way to do this.  I 
downloaded the HPUX 
binary for pine (not 
IMAPD or pico yet), and 
configured pine to use 
msnews.microsoft.com 
for a nntp server per 
http://www.washington.edu/pine/secrets.html
I could subscribe to microsoft.public.internetexplorer.scripting, 
but all of the articles show "No Message Text Available."

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Bob

You can't change this without hacking the pine source code.
It's in a file called reply.c.  Unless you're willing to do
that, there isn't any way to change the message.

I am trying to configure my pine news collections setup, however the syntax I
have to use is a mystery to me.
I already figured out that the following works:
*{news.belnet.be/nntp}[sci.electronics.design}
But I want to have other groups in the same collection, e.g. comp.sys.atari.st
How should I do this?

Microsoft's news
server is broken
and doesn't give
responses needed
by Pine. This is
their own server
software, and it
doesn't work the
way that several
newsreaders want
it to.  Give up.
It's real broke.
Point to any one
of the real news
servers with the
M$ newsgroups on
them.  That will
work to read the
groups with Pine

I'm not sure what you mean by an off-line reader, and I've never tried
it, but you might want to look at PC-PINE.  You'll need an IMAP
server.

	Is there a way to get a follow-up to line among
the headers on messages I want to post (seldom, I hope)
to a group whose robomoderator requires that, short of
reconfiguring my default headers and having the  fool
thing hanging up there in the way every time I start a
message?

Sorry again... I tried your suggestion but this is what I get
at the bottom of the page while composing a message:

^G Get Help  ^X Send      ^R Rich Hdr  ^Y PrvPg/Top ^K Cut Line  ^O
Postpone
^C Cancel    ^D Del Char  ^J Attach    ^V NxtPg/End ^U UnDel Line^T To
AddrBk

so none of the proposed commands can be used for including a file.
Do you understand while my ctrl R doesn't correspond to read file?

Subject: Porting Problem -Fcc
Date: Thu, 05 Sep 1996 15:32:44 GMT
Message-Id: <50mrih$pck@news.monmouth.com>

I am porting Pine to the QNX operating system. I am able to send a
message if I don't have the Fcc folder configured (I set it as empty).


If I specify an Fcc folder, I get the following behavior. The first,
the folder is created and the message is sent without a problem. The
next time (and all subsequent messages) when I select Send for the
message, I am told that the Fcc folder doesn't exist - but it really
does. If I ask the system to create the folder, it tells me that the
folder already exists - which is true.

Does anyone have any ideas as to why in open_fcc() the program thinks
that the Fcc folder does not exist.

Thanks,
Alan Yorinks

Surely you could deny read access to the file for other users? Or are we 
talking about a shared DOS machine here?

	I believe most people missed your question.

	You want your "cursor" to be placed at a specific point.
That option does not exist.

Hello:
  We put pine 3.95 up on our AIX 4.1.4 box and it intermittently
hangs when doing either a compose or a reply.  Backing off to 3.91
still works great, except for posting a bug report to cac washington,
whose robot said they wouldn't talk to us 'til we installed 3.95, 
which hangs when we compose.  Uh-oh, I'm circular...
  Anyone else 'hanging' with 3.95 and AIX 4.1.4?  Working?

AIX4.1.4
UNIX PINE3.95

Greetings ....
We have been trying to resolve this since Late July ...

We receive calls from our clients in various situations,
that their PINE 3.95 session hangs; some indefinitely frozen,
and some intermittently get back to normal situation by doing a 
Cntrl-Z and foregorunding the process .... We have turned on 
debugging and turned SYSV style signaling flags 
on and we tried many things but we seem to be unable 
to find out why PINE3.95 freeze up on many of our clients.

I e-mailed pine-info and pine-debug several times
since August and we have not heard from them yet.

If you're a site with non-problematic usage of UNIX 
PINE 3.95 under AIX4.1.4, maybe we can compare your pre-compile
config file with those of ours and see something we have not
been able to see up to this point ...


Thanks,

Hello,

When you are in "Compose" mode, you only have to use ^R to read
an external file and insert it.

Good luck with PINE.

I'm running 3.90 - I do have an incoming-folders options, but it's blank.
I *think* it's only useful if your mail comes in multiple folders on the
POP server, or if you run procmail, or some such.

I do, however, have the following in my .pinerc -

inbox-path={pop.calweb.com}/var/spool/mail/sbuntin


Pine prompts me for username and password upon connection to the server -
It defaults to sbuntin, so I hit return, then have to manually enter the
password.  

Pine does delete msgs from the inbox, as well.

There is no direct option. But if you use 3.92-3.95, you can use
sending-filter feature (mentioned here a week ago while talking about way
of auto-adding ``-- '' separator by David L. Miller) to replace this
string by a different one by a script (using awk or so).

You can add your own custom headers to the set provided as standard by
Pine in its Setup Configuration screen....

At the Main Menu type "S" (Setup) then "C" (Configuration).  Now look
through the screen for a variable called "customized-hdrs".  If you put
your cursor on this and type "?" it will show you the online help for the
item.

Basically you can use this variable to add a list of additional (custom)
headers with (optionally) default values for each.

When you are composing a message they will not appear by default; to
see/use them put your cursor on a header line and type ^R (Rich Header) to
get the full list of headers available to you.  (Note that if you do set
up a default value for a custom header then it will be set and used even
if you don't type ^R -- this is just to let you see them or change their
value.)

If you want a particualr header to be visible in the list you see when you
compose a message (ie, without having to use ^R) you can do this in the
Setup Configuration screen too.

Cheers,

Pine uses "context sensitive menus" to offer commands relevant to the
thing you are currently trying to do/modify.

When composing a message ^R only means "Read File" when your cursor is
position in the Message Text area (the large area into which you type the
text of your message).

If your cursor is on any of the header fields (eg, "To:", "Cc:",
"Subject:", etc) then it is pretty meaningless to read the contents of a
file into that field.  So instead ^R is changed to mean "Rich Headers";
this shows you all the availabvle headers in place of the four you are
shown by default.

If you put the cursor somewhere in the Message Text area you will see the
command menu now offers you the "^R Read File" option.

Cheers,

The following may explain the effect you are seeing, and give you a way of
improving connection speed without having to resort to the time-bomb of
using numeric IP addresses...

When Pine is configured to use IMAP for mail access it can open the
connection in one of two ways: preauthenticated and unauthenticated.

The former uses a clever technique to avoid you having to enter your
username and password, but requires a small amount of configuration by the
System Manager.

Obviously the preauthenticated method is desirable to users, and so is
tried first by Pine.  If it fails (after a number of seconds) Pine then
reverts to opening an unauthenticated connection and then prompting you to
type in the authentication information.

The delay you are experiencing could well be due to Pine attempting the
preauthenticated connection, failing after timing out, and then switching
to the other sort.  (Although why changing the machine name to a numeric
IP address enclosed in square brackets changes the behaviour I confess I
don't know.)

If this is indeed your problem then there you have two choices: persuade
your System Manager to get preauthenticated connections working (which
would save you having to type in your username and password each time); or
tell Pine not to try the preauthenticated connection (which you know will
always fail) and just open an unauthenticated connection straightaway.

To allow preauthenticated connections the System Manager must, on the IMAP
server computer, create a link so that "/etc/rimapd" links to the real
imapd program.  The next thing is for users to be able to link to the IMAP
computer using the "rsh" command.  This can be done by the System Manager
for everyone by creating a "hosts.equiv" file, or by each user creating a
".rhosts" file on the IMAP computer.  Seek advice before doing either of
these, because if you get it wrong it can open up your username/system to
others.

The other alternative -- to bypass the attempt at opening a
preauthenticated connection -- is achieved very simply by slightly
altering the connection information in your Pine Setup Configuration
screen.  In the example given in the original message change

	inbox-path={imap.domain.fr/user=chris}inbox

to

	inbox-path={imap.domain.fr:143/user=chris}inbox

By supplying the IMAP port number explicitly (rather than leaving it to
the default) you are telling Pine that you ALWAYS want it to open a
connection to the (unauthenticated) IMAP service there.  It stops Pine
first trying the preauthenticated method.

This should substantially increase connection speed for you whilst
retaining the meaningful textual IP names.  However you will still have to
type in your username and password.

Cheers,

Hi,

Just move the cursor down until you are in the body of the message
(under ----- Message Text -----) and the commands at the bottom of
the screen will change.  Mine now show:

^G Get Help  ^X Send      ^R Read File ^Y Prev Pg   ^K Cut Text  
^O Postpone
^C Cancel    ^J Justify   ^W Where is  ^V Next Pg   ^U UnCut Text
^T To Spell

I recommend spending some time nosing around the Pine 'help' if 
you're new, 'cos you'll find out some more of what Pine can do.

Hope this helps.
Leanne.

Christophe

I had this problem with 3.91 and I suspect the problem is with the rsh
responses from server. If so it can can be dealt with quite easily
assuming 3.95 works the same way. (I no longer have an IMAP server to
check) 

Pine tries to make an rsh connection first and waits till thats rejected
before trying IMAP. In some configurations this can be very slow. 

To make pine go straight to imap include the port number a la

	inbox-path={imap.domain.fr:143/user=chris}inbox

The difference between the two boxes is that your SunOS box is having
difficulties resolving the IP address and you would need to look at your
NIS/NIS+ configuration to deal with that.

The microsoft* newsgroups are not officially shared with any other
site, and the report above is correct, it runs nonstandard server
software, or one could say therefore not usenet news software.  For
some reason Microsoft likes it this way.

Hi,

I'm curious if I have SAMBA sharing out mail folders from a Unix box,
would PC-Pine be able to read that inbox directly without having to deal
with IMAP or POP?

Cory

please email responses.

Thanks...I did but I get a message "400 host not recognized in the
autorization file.

Perhaps my santax is wrong

nntp = news.alterdial.uu.net

news folder = *{news.alterdial.uu.net/nntp}[]

Is that right?

For what it's worth, I also see this problem with 
PINE 3.95 running on AIX 4.1.3.

I did not build the pine, but took the pre-compiled version.
Apart from this problem, it works fine.
I also sent in a fault report to the bug reporting e-mail address,
some time in August.

Actually sometimes I think if I just waited a bit longer, my
session would come back, so more recently, if I seem to get the problem
I just am more patient, and (so far) it usually does come back.
(been doing that for about a week).

You don't.  You need to attach a binary file using Ctrl-J in the header so
that the binary file can be encoded (converted to ascii characters) for
transmission as part of a mail message.

Thanks...I did but I get a message "400 host not recognized in the
autorization file.

Perhaps my santax is wrong

nntp = news.alterdial.uu.net

news folder = *{news.alterdial.uu.net/nntp}[]

Is that right?

Hi!

Is there a way of having pine add an extra header in an e-mail and/or
usenet article. I looking for an easy way of adding the Approved: header
for moderating a mailing list. Perhaps there is a better way than using
Pine though, I don't know.

As I mentioned in a previous post, one of the things I think pine needs is
an `enable-sigdashes' option, so that when appending a signature pine
automatically places a "-- " on the line preceding the signature.

Here's the patch I came up with to add an enable-sigdashes option to pine
3.95.  I didn't spend a lot of time on it, so it could be (and probably is)
buggy.  Use at your own risk.

I tried for a couple minutes to add help text, but couldn't get the text
I had added to appear when the ? key was pressed, so I left the help text
out.

Egads, I've seen this problems with HP-UX 10.10, and I assumed it was bugs
in HP's curses library, since they seem to have made some fairly big changes
there for 10.x.  Since I had more important stuff going on from the 10.x
upgrade, and other changes, I hadn't really put any effort into looking into
this yet.  But I never thought to check the terminfo definitions...

Hey HP, you _really_ should change it back to how it was, I've had a lot of
users using PC VT100 emulation software from home complaining about emacs,
vi, pine, lynx, ncftp, etc.  I know that at least some of was fixed by my
trying this simple fix.  Not working with standard PC terminal emulators is
going to make people think that HP's quality is at fault, not the authors of
the terminal emulators.  Yes yes, I know, standards compliance and all that,
but sometimes standards are determined by what is really out there, not what
some ANSI standard document claims!

If it isn't changed, I suspect it'll become one of those things that HP admins
who know what they are doing do to systems after they are installed as a
matter of course, while less knowledgeable admins will not know why their HP
systems behave this way.  And its these sort of details that cause people to
prefer one sort of Unix system over another.

  After a week of debugging I found the problem with Pine 3.95
apparently
locking is an unitialized buffer being passed to the terminal setup
routine
in Pico.  The fix is to update Pico to use terminfo.

Steps: (in pico directory)

  1. Edit makefile.a41 change tcap.c/tcap.o entries to tinfo.c/tinfo.o

  2. Edit os_unix.h and update the following (note the added a41
define):
     /* Machine/OS definition                        */
     #if     defined(ptx) || defined(sgi) || defined(sv4) ||
defined(sco) ||
             defined(a41)
     #define TERMINFO        1               /* Use
TERMINFO               */
     #else
     #define TERMCAP         1               /* Use
TERMCAP                */
     #endif

  3. A little cleanup to tinfo.c (in routine tinfoopen()):

    if (Pmaster) {
        /*
         *              setupterm() automatically retrieves the value
         *              of the TERM variable.
         */
        int err;
        setupterm ((char *)0, 1, &err);      /* <-- Add cast */
        if (err != 1) return FALSE;
    }
    else {
        /*
         *              setupterm() issues a message and exits, if the
         *              terminfo data base is gone or the term type is
         *              unknown, if arg2 is 0.
         */
        setupterm ((char *)0, 1, (int *)0);  /* <-- Add cast */
    }

  Since these small changes Pine 3.95 has been rock solid under AIX
4.1.4
and 4.2.  Good luck.

In general, an offline reader can connect to the news server download and
store messages and then disconnect from the news server.  So you are not
accessing the news server everytime you move to at new message, the
messages are stored on  your hard disk.

I got it to work as follows:

Go to the Setup Config screen and set the option
print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt.

Now, when you use the print (Y) command, you can send the output to a
command instead of to a printer, by pressing (C) for CustomPrint.

So, from the address book do:

Y (print)
C (customprint)

The brief answer is "yes, but it's a bad idea."

It's slower, less functional, and less reliable (no locking) than IMAP.

1)  When I press CTRL-K to kill a line, pine only clears it, then deletes
it with another press.  It never used to do this.  Can this be fixed?

2)  Is it possible to turn off writing to dead-letter?

Thanks!

In trying to set the initial key strokes to take me into my inbox and open
the first message, I type in "i,CR".  For some reason, the "i" is accepted
on the proper line, but the "CR" is placed on the next line by itself.  If
I save the new .pinerc file and reboot, i get a message telling me that
there is a missing comma.

    Indeed.  It has come to the point, in my informal observation, that
so few observe this convention (if they even know about it, which many
probably do not) that for practical purposes it has ceased to be
effective or even very meaningful.  The world does change, and
sometimes even de facto standards become obsolete and therefore
unenforceable in practice.

    Indeed, again.  When I am writing running text, my preferred Un*x 
editor routinely truncates trailing blanks when writing a file, so that
even if I had "-- " in my .signature, Pine includes it automatically as
part of the editable text, and the editor would simply truncate the
blank.  The signature delimiter may be "too well-established to
change," but it collides with the reality of the tools people use.

Check to see if the following feature is enabled:

  composer-cut-from-cursor

If so, turn it off.  (Unless you want emacs-style control-K behavior,

This is the new behavior with the compose-cut-from-cursor feature
selected.  Deselect that feature and you should get the old behavior
back.

This is a FAQ.  The answer is yes.  Check out the programs `filter' (part
of the Elm distribution) or `procmail', among others.

I have been trying for sometime to duplicate the output of pine from
within a perl script. I have not been able to produce a message from
which ccMail will detach a file except by using the attach method in
pine. 

One option that should work (I know it is ugly) is to program the
desired keystrokes into a -I parameter, but I cannot embed a CR or TAB
or anything that will cause the next input to go to the next header. Can
anyone tell me how to embed a CR, or better yet, how to do this
sensibly?

	I'm using the Slakware 3.0 distribution of Linux, Pine 3.91, and
fetchpop1.9 to get my e-mail from one of the campus computer systems here
over a PPP line.  However, when I send mail, it always ends up saying it
came from root@scf.usc.edu  I'm really at ness@scf.usc.edu, or preferably
nessa@usa.net.  Is there any way that I can get PINE to send mail with
that in the From: field?

	Well, since the question was for "all" incoming mail then maybe
the .forward technique will suffice?  (On some systems you can see
"man sendmail" for details.)

From where does Pc-Pine (for Windows 16bit) get its timezone from ?

My Timezone is incorrect by 7 hours (PDT time). I assume this is a 
default time zone..

Thanks.

I am trying to set up imapd on a HP running HP-UX 10.10.
I just used the binaries for HP-UX 9 'cause I couldn't build it
from scratch.
My problem now:
On the machine is a shadow password system installed. No log in
at the imap port is accepted. 
Question: Is there a version of imapd for HP-UX available that supports
shadow passwords? Do you know where to find an already compiled version?

Thanks
Jan

One other thing -- Pine is not good about locating files, even if it says
it's looking in your home directory. You have to tell it the path
explicitly: 
	~/newfile		;if it's in your home directory or
	~/mail/newfile		;if it's in the 'mail' subdirectory.

Pine apparently 'helps' you by preventing you from MAILing a message with
the Newsgroups: header set to some value.  This then means that you can't
use pine to send mail to the mail2news gateways, which expect to receive
MAIL with a Newsgroups: line defining where to post the enclosed message.
They will also respect an enclosed References: line, to properly link follow
on messages.  This header also is not supported in Pine in regular mail.

Arrgghh!!  Does 3.95 fix this??  Isn't there any way to get 3.94 to send
the mail, and not cry about the NNTP not being set up??

For about a month we have been using Pine 3.95 successfully on our Sun
SPARC 20 under Solaris 2.3.  Rather than compile it locally, I used the
precompiled binaries from the ftp site.
 
However, there have been several occasions within the past few days when
Pine has aborted with the following message:
 
  Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
  Pine Exiting.
  Abort
 
The .pine-debug offers no useful clues, saying only this at the very end
of the file.  Aside from this, .pine-debug shows nothing unusual:
 
  about to end_tty_driver
  Pine Panic: Received abort signal
 
According to reports from our users, this only occurs while composing a
message.  The message is not preserved when Pine aborts, so the user has
to start over from scratch.  Naturally, it's always a very long message. 
:-(
 
Any ideas?

If you dont have IN-ADDR setup in DNS and your running TCP wrappers you'll
get slow response. Replacing the name with a number will solve the
symptom. Best to setup IN-ADDR as this slow response will manifest in
other aplications as well.

The mail-to-news gateway I use on occasion requires me to name the 
newsgroup in the "To: " header.

May I ask what gateway you use?

Just add the "References: " header in customized headers. It is 
supported. On the other hand, Pine does not allow you to manually enter 
information into the "In-Reply-To: " header.

Before sending the followup article, enable the full headers. Then, 
manually cut the Message ID, and paste it into the References: header. 
But, do remember to cut the other 30 unneeded headers!

This is not necessary in version later than 3.91. Just enable viewing the 
"Message-ID: " header.

> They will also respect an enclosed References: line, to properly link follow

Incidently, to those of you reading this as a followup article on Usenet, 
this message was sent to the pine-info list with the References: header 
added. The header is not always passed through upon being gated to Usenet.

I am curious to try her mail-to-news gateway, to see if it preserves more 
headers.

I have tried manually entering Message IDs into header information for 
the purpose of news-to-mail gateway. But, Pine does not allow additional 
Message IDs to be entered into the "In-Reply-To: " header, even though 
that does seems to be encouraged by the RFC!

What would be really nice would be if gateways automatically converted 
"References: " to "In-Reply-To: ", to allow for threading, so that the 
author of the reply/followup article doesn't need to.

It would also be nice if Pine threaded e-mail messages, wherever the 
"In-Reply-To: " header existed. (Many MUAs don't add that header.)

i have some extremely long mailing lists.  whenever i send something out
on them, it is very annoying to the readers because they have to wade
through pages and pages of header addresses.  is there any way for the
readers to simply see the title of the mailing list, without seeing every
single address, in pine?

please email me,
ted

The Zmodem command is usually sz to download and rz to upload:

I use procomm/pcplus on my pc, which has a configuration option to
automatically download when the host starts it.  Telix probably has the

There was annoying fact that when the number of fields in header is
variable so the "Subject:" line was usually in different place when
reading each message. So it was pain in ass to find it when reading
messages in cruise-cruse mode (N or D advances to next message), and I
usually found myself reading message, then going to index to read subject
of next message, and then going into the next message.

Here is an small fix to make subject of message being in green color
(replace the 32 w/ 7 to get inverse video modem for terminals which does
not support colors).

So now, when you _view_ each message, the subject highlighted /w cool
green color. 

Yep, there is ample room for improvement, it could be possible to add it
for config file/setup, it could ask in what color you want it highlighted,
it could detec if your terminal support color, and if not use inverse
video mode. It could colorize other parts of header. For example the
signature could be yellow, the body dark-whie, and other parts of header
(evelope) in differnet colors -- but for me it does all what I wanted to.

Well, you can do several things.  I don't think Pine will let you change your
user name from root to ness, just because that would make sending fake email
too easy.  You can however change the domain name from scf.usc.edu to whatever
by setting the user-domain option, in pine's setup menu. 

Another way to change the domain name is in sendmail.  You should have a line
in your /etc/sendmail.cf file that looks like this:
# who I masquerade as (null for no masquerading)
DM

Just add the domain you want mail to appear to come from after the DM.  This
way if you send mail with elm, mail or netscape instead of pine the domain
will still get changed.  This is how I do it.

If you want to change the username, I would suggest making a user called "ness"
and using that instead of root.  You really shouldn't use your computer as root
all the time anyway.

There is also a header field called Reply to:  for when you want email replies
to go to a different email address than the mail came from.  Mailing lists
often use it.  I'm not sure how to get pine to automatically add this.

Are you logging into the Linux machine as "ness"?  You'll need to be doing
that if you are not now.  Also, in Pine setup, you can set the domain name
so that it'll show "usa.net" after the "user@".

No, that's only necessary for default-composer-hdrs, not customized-hdrs.

i'm having problems opening my inbox.  the program reports that it can't
open it for some reason.

i also have "mm" in my directory and have been using that.

perhaps that is causing some confusion in mail directing.

please tell me what to do.

thanks

As you can see, I am running Pine 3.93 (the latest version that my
administrator will place on the server for those who want something other
than 3.91) on Solaris.

The only change I made to my default settings was to change the
user-domain part to uci.edu so that the from header shows my alias address
instead of my exact server address (which is a little more preferred by
me).  My alias is the same ID I have on this server so it works well.

Question: Why all of a sudden is pine worried about who owned the process
(which I did own anyway)? And how can I change some setting so it doesn't
have a fit over this and will not have an authentication warning line.

For bandwidth purposes, direct replies only are needed if you prefer.

Thank you,
Rasheed

Boy did I ever screw up.  Advice on the solution to this is welcome,
requested, and appreciated. 



Here's my problem.



I save various messages from various usenet newsgroups.

I use maybe 12-to-24 different files with different names to keep things
orderly.

Normal sequence for saving a message is like this

1	"S"  for save
2	"^T" takes me to the files
3	     cursor keys take me to the specific file I want
4	<Enter> key chooses that file.
5	<Enter> puts the message in that file.


Then sometimes I get fancy (or so I thought) and skip steps 2/3/4 by just
remembering the name of the desired file and putting that name in place
using my keyboard.

This, of course, puts the same-named (but logically separate) file in my
home directory instead of the ..../mail/... directory.




And the result ?  Duplicate file names on non-duplicate files located on
logically different  areas on my machine; i.e. el-confuse-o max-o



Is there a simple way to ....

	(A)	Take all of the contents of the file
		in my home directory 

	(B)	Put said contents into the file in the 
		..../mail/... sub-directory which has 
		the same name

	(C)	Delete the file in my home directory 
		which has the improperly chosen 
		duplicate name.

		...?


Thanks for any advice which is simple to understand and which also works
in real life.

Hi all,

	Sorry if this is a faq!  For some reasons, I need to read more
than one news server (eg. one local and one remote).  And I need to keep
track the news groups from each news server (in other words, I subscribe
different news groups from different news server), how I could I do that?
Maybe something like: .newsrc.local.hostname and .newsrc.remote.hostname
Thanks.

start pine with the -p flag followed by the path to the .pinerc file
	 -p <pinerc>    Use alternate .pinerc file

for more, start pine with the flag: -h

Note that filter knows about other headers besides subject -- "to" and "from"
are two other commonly searched headers.

    You could suggest to AOL and CompuServe that they get with the
program and conform their email software to a published Internet
standard! :-)

    Seriously, there was come complaint on an active and international
mailing list I am on about sending 8-bit characters (usually
ISO-8859-1).  Not long after, the list owner announced that the
software on the server (in Denmark) was being made Mime-compliant, and
that as far as he was concerned, it was up to subscribers to be able to
handle Mime-compliant email, because it is an Internet standard.  (With
Pine, of course, I have no problems. :-) )

    I know that doesn't help you with your immediate problem, but
unless outfits like AOL and CIS are pushed, they may not comply with
standards.  They seem to think that everybody wants, and is too stupid
to handle anything else but, point-and-click.

	Pine hides the e-mail headers, unfortnatuely.   At
my ISP, pine only shows the forged sender lines.  To see 
the full headers of my mail, I have to type 
"more /var/mail/username".  This shows all my mail with full 
headers.  Then I have to go into emacs and edit out everything
except the particular spam I want to look at.

	This is a royal pain in the ass and I wish I had access
to a mail reader with full headers, but at this time I do not.

	This should help you get started....

        OPTION: Customized-Headers
 
You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.

Pine is able to offer full view of headers. In setup check:

            [X]  enable-full-header-cmd                

and then use h to turn on (and off again) full-headermode when you
read the messages.

Yes.. I know about Netscape.. but sometimes I have to telnet from a 
remote location that only has terminal capabilities.. so I can only run 
pine.. but I'l check into the pop version of pine.. or maybe someone else 
can tell me about a good poper for linux??

thanks!

Subject: pine to recognize other addresses as me
Date: 9 Sep 1996 02:20:25 GMT
Message-Id: <slrn536vn9.6oo.edwalter@sigma.not.for.mail>


I am new to pine and have a question.  Is there a wayto have pine
recognize additional addresses other than the username of the system
I am on as me?  For example, I get my mail from three sites via POP3.
The addresses are edwalter@usa.net, walter@chem.wisc.edu, and
edwalter@students.wisc.edu.  Is there a way to make pine recognize
these addresses as me so that the '+' status marker works and so pine
doesn't always ask about replying to *all* addresses when there is
really only one address besides me?  Do you understand what I mean?

Currently, pine does not put any + signs because my machine
(sigma.not.for.mail) is not on the Internet full time and does not
receive any mail directly.  It is all POPed.  Also, if I reply to a
message that was sent to edwalter@usa.net, pine asks if i want my
reply sent to both the sender and edwalter@usa.net.

Any help is appreciated,
Erv Walter

I am getting annoyed at the increase of advertising email making it
into my inbox too. I've some simple filtering setup with procmail
already. If any procmail gurus have suggestions or any existing
example code to find spam I would be interested in seeing it.

You will be happy to know that pine will display any header information 
that you require! You may grant your own wish!

Go to the configuration file. From the main menu, choose (S)etup, 
(C)onfigure. Look for the enable-full-headers feature. With this feature 
enabled, you may view all of the message header information with the 
(H)eader command from the index, or while viewing a message. You will see 
the bang-path routing information that your mail took to reach your 
machine. Or, at least as much as the spammer wasn't able to hide.

While in the configuration file, you may also choose to display 
additional headers while viewing your message, in versions after 3.91.

Message-Id: <3233D254.3008@netcom.ca>

I followed all the installation instructions but PC Pine still does not
work on my computer.  Whenever I open the program, it says "No inbox!". 
:(

I've played around with the setup/configuration, but I'm lost on the
syntax of specifying folders (which I think may be the problem). 
Basically, I want Pine's folders to work in a directory on my hard drive
-- just like Pegasus Mail or Eudora Lite.

I have an internet account with Netcom that has these protocols: SMTP,
NNTP, and POP.  Is my problem related to this IMAP thingy that I keep
coming across?  (I'm not sure what it is at this moment and I'm not sure
whether my ISP provides this)

Any help would be much appreciated,

Hi,
	My PC-Pine responds with a "Out of free storage" error message whenever
I try saving a message. It is connected to a Novell network The error 
occurs while trying to access a folder, which resides on our main-frame unix 
machine.
	Is there a way to solve this problem?

Close, but not quite. Now it looks like James Del Vecchio wrote what
Clint Danbury actually did, while the part which JDV actually wrote does
not have an attribution at all.

The custom is: the attribution should have one less level of indentation
than what is quoted. This corresponds to the fact that the attribution
is usually added by the next correspondent, and so should have the
same indentation as what the next correspondent writes.

The following is how it would work:

It would be really neat to have pine able to do this ^J trick
while being sensitive of reply marks like > or :  that way
when you do the justify ^J this:


>>> Boss,

doesn't become:

>>> Boss,
>>> Bob go to .....
way out there ... show >>> them the project report


but rather

>>> Boss,
>>> Bob go to....
>>> way out there .... show them the project .....


so the reply marks don't get all mixed into the text

We are having difficulty pasting clipboards of over a very few sentences' 
length into new messages.  Pine takes the beginning couple sentences of 
the clipboard and pastes it over and over into the message until we kill 
the session.  When doing this Pine does not respond to the telnet 
abort-output, are you there, break, or interrupt process commands.

I think we are running version 3.93.  This, along with the fact that 
people can't download messages to their harddrives directly out of Pine, 
is compelling some people to migrate to Eudora when they might otherwise 
stay with Pine.  Was this second problem fixed in 3.94?  How does it work 
in that version?

Insights appreciated!

Yes I do, your question was quite clear and to the point!

And now for the good news: yes, there is a way to do this in Pine. 
Assuming that you are running the latest and greatest version of Pine
(3.95), do the following: 

From the main menu, select "Setup" followed by "Config". In the list of
configurable options that is then being displayed, look for the option
"alt-addresses" (to quickly find it, you can type "w" followed "alt-a").

Now press "a" to add one of your alternative E-Mail addresses and continue
doing this until you've added them all. Next, press "e" to exit the config
utility and save the changes. This should solve your problems with replies
and the + sign for personal mail.

Kind regards,

Try ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed/
	pico-bin-linux.gz
	pilot-bin-linux.gz
	pine-bin-linux.gz

There may be a /pub thrown in the path somewhere, but I think that's right
;-)  BTW, those are only the precompiled binaries.  I think the source
(pine3.95.tar.gz) is in the /pine directory.

I hope it's only a Setup option that I'm overlooking.

Anyway, What the problem is, is that whenever I send a message, to a
Listserv for Ex. the (who the message is from line) has (who the message
was to), instead.  Which means, that the other people on the list can't
tell that the message is from me without reading it, which (to be honest)
is a hassle when on a high-volume list.  Is there a Setup command, that
I'm missing somewhere?

I'm using Pine 3.95 for Linux and although I use a 'popper' to get my mail,
I also have my inbox on my ISP's mail server set up as an incoming folder -
just for the heck of it...


My ISP (InterLink LC)'s mail server machine is: mailhost.interl.net

in $HOME/.pinerc - with incoming folders enabled:

incoming-folders="Interlink Inbox" {mailhost.interl.net/pop3}INBOX

With the above, your INBOX will be /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME (the local
inbox) and Interlink Inbox is the remote INBOX.


If you want to change INBOX from /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME to your inbox on
the remote machine (then you won't be able to read locally delivered mail
with Pine), set this in $HOME/.pinerc

inbox-path={mailhost.interl.net/pop3}INBOX


I also use popclient to get my mail which throws it in
/var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME.  Try
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Mail/pop/popclient-3.0.tar.gz

Read the INSTALL file, follow the instructions, then create .poprc in your
home directory.  To get my mail from the same inbox as above I have the
following two lines in my $HOME/.poprc:

defaults localfolder /var/spool/mail/A
server mailhost.interl.net proto pop3 user B pass C

A = my username on the machine running Pine
B = my username on the ISP's mail server
C = my password on the ISP's mail server

Once that's set then you simply run popclient (no cmdline parameters
are necessary because of the .poprc in your home directory) to get your
mail.  ...it will then be placed in /var/spool/mail/[a] and you can then
read it on or offline using Pine by selecting your INBOX folder.

  Jason

PS - There is no 'pop version' of Pine, pop support is built in (and stable
- - for me at least - in v3.95)

In your .pinerc, add your 3 addresses to the alt-addresses= setting:

alt-addresses=edwalter@usa.net,
	walter@chem.wisc.edu,
	edwalter@students.wisc.edu

I have three addresses also, other than what I'm logged in as (otherwise
this would come from root@necro.interl.net).  I recompiled Pine to
"allow_changing_from", then set From: to the address I have from my ISP. 
You might want to do that with your edwalter@usa.net address since it's most
likely redirected to one of the other ones anyway...

...but FYI, I don't get the question from Pine asking me if I want to reply
to the sender and myself ;)

OK, Patti, you can't directly download the contents of a (pine) folder. 
You first have to save that stuff (e)xport it to a unix file, then
download the unix file from your server.  Hope that makes sense?  BYE

I believe it does, just specify your inbox, in config, like this:

{mail.server.com/pop3}

It will ask for your login name and password, then d/l the mail.
imap is better though, if you have imap access, just put in:

{mail.server.com}

imap doesn't have to d/l the entire mailbox either.  I believe pop does.

Hehehe, they say the best man for the job is the one who suggests it needs
doing. They also say RTFM. Well, having taken a little time to read
/usr/doc/pine-3.95-1/tech-notes , I've found the solution to my problem,
which will hopefully be of benefit to others...

/usr/doc/pine-3.95-1/tech-notes:
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM
    Determines whether users are allowed to modify the From line on
    outgoing mail. Even with this turned on, users will have to include
    From in their default-composer-hdrs or customized-hdrs in order to be
    able to edit the From line. Default is to not

So it seems this is an optional, compile-time restriction. A good idea,
really, just a pity it limits the decent folks. Ah well, only 30 hours to
go before my download completes. Don't you love it when your local mirrors
are down? :)

Sheldon.

Hi,

is there any TAB completion possible to be turned on for nicknames
(in the Compose form)? (Example: Lu<TAB> would expand to Lucilla if
Lucilla is in the addressbook)

  I have had reports of this too.  I called IBM support; they suggestred a
number of debugging tactics, and I asked if I would be ill-advised to
upgrade bos.rte.tty.  Tomorrow I will upgrade AIX:

	NEW				OLD
	---				---
	bos.rte.up.4.1.4.17		bos.rte.up.4.1.4.11
	bos.rte.tty.4.1.4.16		bos.rte.tty.4.1.4.4
	devices.tty.rte.4.1.4.9		devices.tty.rte.4.1.4.0

which are numerous fixes in the terminal area, and see what develops.

P.S.  I have also experienced "hangs" that were not: the screen did not
change when, for example, I pressed "C" from the folder list.  For this a
CTRL/L brought up the right screen.

I'm using PINE 3.93 and running a csh. Whenever new mail arrives, there
is a broadcast message that new mail has arrived. This message appears
in the middle of the mail that I am reading within PINE and then the
text of the new mail appears in the middle of the older message.

Do I fix this from within PINE or is there something that needs to be
fixed via the .cshrc?

Thanks,
 Jeff

	Yes, you are missing something.....

	I believe you are assuming that since the message you have sent
to the list is also being sent to you and pine is displaying it as:
"To: XXXX" that everyone is seeing it in that manner.

	This is a topic that comes up frequently on this group.
It is a "feature" of pine that shows messages that *you* sent to *you*
as "To: XXXX" since you know you sent it.  

	It is a "presentation" thing only.  Meaning, the "From:" 
header is still there for everyone else to see.  You can still use
procmail (or whatever) to filter on that header.

Yes. While viewing the message itself, press V for View attachment. An
ordinary email contains (in the view of pine) one attachment, which is the
body without headers. Then choose S for Save from the attachment index.

Mime is a big problem because whenever I send a file, program, or picture
it sends a whole ton of text that no one I know can decode.
Can this Mime thing be changed to something else that people on America
Online and CompuServe can decode?

If you would like to keep informed about new mails, maybe you try ^L every
time your screen gets confused (in pine or emacs).

You talk to your webmaster who takes care of it.  The file has to be either
somewhere within your web server's document tree, or there has to be symbolic
link from there to wherever the file is, or you have to have the web server
set up to use a public_html directory type of a setup and put the file there.
Exactly what you have to do depends on your web server setup.

You have access to a mail read with full headers: Pine!

In the Setup screen, turn on "enable-full-header-command".  Now, when
reading messages, the "H" command will work to toggle between full headers
and filtered headers.

I've seen one of the guys in the office set things up so that he can
change his From: field while composing messages...

.pinerc:
# Add these customized headers (and possible default values) when
# composing
customized-hdrs=From: Sheldon Hearn <sheldonh@iafrica.com>,
	Reply-To:

He is using FreeBSD 2.1.5STABLE and Pine 3.95 . I'm using Redhat 3.0.3
linux (with which I'm thrilled, I got a real malicious kick out of nuking
my Win95 drive for more swap space) and Pine 3.95 .

If I leave my .pinerc set up like that, I get the message "Not allowed to
modify From field" when I start composing a message. On my friend's BSD
system, it works fine.

As an aside, I realise that changing From fields is often a means of
abusing email, however the ability to do so would come in very handy for
work purposes.

Any comments would be much appreciated.

Regards,
Sheldon.

ehm, yes i was a bit too enthusiastic... running :%s/erm1/130.... on
.pinerc appeared not to be the best idea. I swapped userdomain again to
symbolic name....

In fact the problem resided on one side on the slow dns-response and on the
other side on the failed rsh attempt. On my system I use ssh with a symbolic
link named rsh, as a fallback i keeped old rsh...
while ssh doesn't produce disturbing output when summoned, old rsh does....

Now I changed my /etc/profile to work with old rsh and moved old rsh to a
new location replacing it with a link to ssh, since i like the idea of
encryption....

BTW i didn't find the compile option specifying the location of rsh...
what happens if there isn't /usr/bin/rsh?

Another question: when pine runs long time, now less than before i get
inbox access errors. Interestingly pine trys to open that box even when i
am scanning the other boxes, resulting in lots of errors. Is this behaviour
normal? (The inbox too is on my smtp server...). Other point the errors
occur only in long runs, if i close pine and start another session then no
error occur....

ciao
bboett

    I am aware of that.  That's why I wrote "Reply-to: ..." with the
colon and ellipses to show that you will probably want to fill in the
actual reply-to address.  That's why I also said to check the help

Hi,


I wonder does anyone has the same problem with me.

I am using Pine 3.95 on my Linux(2.0.0) machine. After 
successfully popping my mail from my ISP, I will invoke
Pine to read it. But the strange thing is that, with every
new message, I will have a message without any text(without subject &
from who),
an empty line, diplaying prior to every new e-mail in the Index of
incoming mails.

Any advice will be appreciated.

Pls get back by e-mail if possible.

Thanks.

Best Regards,
Edward

Insert the following command into your PC's AUTOEXEC.BAT (or CONFIG.SYS,
if you're running DOS 6 or higher):

SET TZ=<tz><off><dst>

where you replace <tz> by a 3-character timezone name, <off> by the
timezone offset (like -7 or 5 for 7 hours behind or 5 hours ahead of GMT),
and <dst> by a 3-character abbreviation for daylight savings tiem zone.

I believe PINE takes the offset wrong, so play with it until it works.

Well, you are correct.  I thought that a short answer indicating that pine
has built-in (and context sensitve) help might answer the question, but
obviously it did not.  Thank you.  G'Day.

Is there a way to keep Pine from automatically asking me if I wish to
delete messages I've saved from months past.  At the beginning of each
month I am asked if I'd like to delete this old mail.  On several
occasions I have inadvertantly replied "yes" and lost important archives.
BTW I've checked for a setup option to turn off this pine 'feature'.

Also, is it possible to perform a search of all mail folders at once
instead of sequentially?

Was there a solution to this problem?  If so, I missed it, and I'm
experiencing the same situation with a setup very similar to Masieh.

You can customize your composer headers in config/setting. I believe the
option is called custom-compose-hdrs or something equally as obvious. The
only problem is that if you choose this, you have to type in *all* headers
that you want to appear, or they will not show up.

PS--sorry to all those who are so religious about the "-- " before sig
lines. I've never used 'em and never will. No need as far as I see. If you
can't tell the difference between text and sigs, then go ahead and waste
your time.  ;^]

You simply create a file in your home directory called ".signature" and
edit it to taste. You might be creating the sig file in a different
directory, in which case you have to indicate the path in Pine's
setup/config settings.

Keep in mind that if you only type in "Reply-to", that's all that will
appear from your composer.

Hello,

I have an imap server which suport a lot of pine 3.94 remote clients.
each time a client from some remote machine is trying to connect to the
imap server its take a lot of time until the connection is established.
the message "Opening "INBOX" </>" takes about 1 minute until i got the:
"ENTER LOGIN NAME: stots" from the host,
I guess it is because some try to open a remote shell or something,
can someone tell me what should i change in the source to make the
connection more fast ?


Sincerely yours

Stots

We use a global address book that is automagically generated every night,
but we also need a way of automagically generating the .lu file.  (or
getting pine to stop complaining about not finding the global .lu file)
Does anybody have a program to do that?

Thanks

Some email programs, like Sun's 'mailtool' allow the
message to be sent to be retained after actually
sending it out.

This helps when I need to send one message to one set
of people, but need to alter a portion of the message
for another set of people, without having to rewrite
the entire email.

Right now, the only way to do it is to edit a text
file and then read (^R) it into a compose window and
edit it.

It would be easier to compose a message, send it (without
removing the compose window), edit it and send it to
the other destination(s).

Any chance of this?

Subject: Upgrading VMS Pine 3.89 to 3.95?

	I need to upgrade our current version of Pine (3.89) to the newest
which I believe is 3.95.

	I was wondering if anyone has done the same operation and would like to
spread the knowledge around.  

	I would appreciate any help that I can get.

	Thank You

Subject: Upgrading pine 3.89 for VMS.

	I am in need of some information on upgrading a VAX VMS Pine system
from 3.89 to the latest version.

	Is there a later version of Pine for the VMS or is it strictly for UNIX
and PC?  If there is a later version where is one able to download this file?

	We ftp'd to the download site and were unable to find any versions
stating that they were VMS.

I have been getting a message which flashes for a second or two as I sign
on to PINE.

[Bad initial keystroke "<no value set>" (no comma set?)

Does anyone know what this means?  I asked our computer personnel here and
got no explanation.  Thanks.

Here are some ways to do this in the current Pine 3.95 release:

1.	- Set the Fcc: to INBOX (use ^R in the headers so expose it)
	- forward each copy, making the necessary edits.

2.	- Set the Fcc: to postponed-msgs
	- The message will then be "postponed" ready to resume for the
	  next variation.

3.	- Cc: yourself and proceed like 1.

and other variations...

Probably the easiest solution is to convert the folders to MTX format
(PC-Pine's native format) before downloading them.  If you can wade
through a compile, grab

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z
AND	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

Uncompress and untar them both in the same directory, and compile
mbxcvt.  Then you can convert a folder with

	mbxcvt oldfolder mtx newfolder

Good luck!

    It means that 06:18:46 is seven hours earlier than Greenwich Mean
Time (Universal Coordinated Time), the "zero point" for time around the
world.  In other words, the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in
Greenwich, England, was 13:18:46 when you sent your message (assuming
your system's clock was accurate down to the second).

    This indicator on email and newsgroup postings is very, very
valuable.  It allows a recipient to convert the time the message was
sent into his/her own local time for comparison.  I live in the eastern
US and wanted to try to engage in a "ytalk" session with someone in SE
Australia.  From the time indicator on emails I had received from him,
I knew what the time difference between us was, so I could try to catch
him at a time when he might be home and be logged on.

	In your .pinerc file look for:

last-time-prune-questioned=96.9

	Set it =05.12 and wait for January 2006.   Hummmm...wonder if
pine is year 2000 safe.  :-) :-)

	Yes, pine.

	Type "pine -h" and you will see the option:

	 -create_lu <abook_file> <ab_sort_type>   create .lu from script

	Seems to fit the bill....(or the Matt)  :-) :-)

	It is the GMT (or is it UTC these days???) offset.  I live in
Taiwan, therefore my Timezone is GMT+0800.

I recently compiled and installed pine 3.95 on my linux Redhat
system. The old (3.91) version was setup to view the horrid
binhexed attachments that mac people send me, using external programs
to unbinhex them and extract the text from the MSWord binary and
simply output it to STDOUT. This caused it to be displayed nicely
within the pine browser.

[Aside: the mind boggles at the nonsense of all the processes that
intervene when people try to use MSWord as some kind of "standard"
for exchanging information, almost always simply text.]

The new version does not display. I get a message about displaying
attachments and a new one: "Viewer command launched" but nothing
appears. Anyone know what gives?

I had to reinstall 3.91 till I figure it out.

Ian

I don't know how this happened - somehow my INBOX is now 'readonly' and I
don't what that.  I have no idea why this happened suddenly.  This change
occurred after attempting to send a message to an invalid e-mail address.
Any suggestions?

	OK, I did that long since; but even when I have

I get complaints from better-informed subscribers that I

Yes you can.  I do it all the time.  A pine folder is simply a single text
file with a number of mail messages in it.  My saved-mail folder is
~/mail/savemail and at the end of the month I rename it to savemail.aug or
whatever and then sz savemail.aug from within the /mail subdirectory. 
Then I delete it on the unix system and start fresh in September.  You can
export if you want, but it just creates a duplicate file under a different
name.

Right, right and right!  Thanks for clarifying and simplifying.  Saving the
attachment is the way to go, though it does include a blank line at the start of
the file.

Pine takes the offset the same way that the C library does.  West of GMT
is positive, east is negative.  Not that this is the opposite of the way
that RFC 822 works.

The DOS default is PST8PDT for US west coast time, which happens to be
where Microsoft is located...[it's where we're located too, but we didn't
do it -- if we had we probably would have used GMT.]

Whether or not this is "wrong" is, of course, a matter of opinion.  What's
important is that Pine does the same thing as all other PC software that
follows Microsoft's conventions.

Heck, this seems like a good enough question to ask. If you don't have the

Contact your local Help Desk and see if they've seen the problem before, and
have any insight.

There are two situations that I'm aware of that would cause pine to treat
your inbox as readonly.

1) another pine process is accessing your inbox.  Ask your help desk to help
you search the process list of the machine you're on) and make sure that you 
don't have multiple copies of pine running.

2) you may have strange (garbage) characters in the headers of one of the
messages in your inbox.  This is especially likely being you're on an OSF
machine (we've had this happen on one of our Digital Unix machines, and
I've heard similar reports from administrators on other DU machines).

You can ask your Help Desk or system administrator to search the headers
in your inbox with a tool capable of spotting out of band characters.
Something like `od -c' or `less' should work.  Look for characters immediately
preceding the `From ' that begins each new message in your inbox.  You'll
most likely find one or more octal 377 character on one of the headers,
preceding the `From '.

If you do find any out of band characters in your inbox, your sysadmin or
Help Desk will have to delete them using an editor or other tool.  Otherwise
you can just mv your mail spool file to a new name, and a new spool file
will be created for you.  You can see the old messages in your old spool
file with a program like `more' or `less'.

Hi Ming,

Yes indeed you can,

First, set your favorite printer using "S" Setup on the main menu,
then choose the task P[Printer] and update the printer command you
expect to use (someting like lpr -Pprinter_name if you are using UNIX)..

After, when you are reading your mail, choose O (Other command) and 
Y (prYnt). Then pine will ask you "lpr -Pprinter_name "? [Yes] or [No]..
the rest is in your hands ...

Good luck

Jean

Sounds to me like you have an invalid entry in your Pine configuration.
From the Main Menu, hit S then C to configure Pine, then find the line that
starts with "initial-keystroke-list."  Hit D to delete the current value, 
then E to exit configuration and Y to save changes.

    I ran into that when I was trying to set up initial keystroke
sequences on my terminal communications program's "hot keys."  I never
could figure out what Pine was bellyaching about.  Meaningless, vague,
ambiguous, useless, or unhelpful error messages are the bane of
computers.  Pine Team?  The ball's in your court.

The -w option does not prevent word-wrap for me.

Pico version is 2.9

Anyone else have this problem?

This is under linux and NeXT (m68k).

Is there a limit to the line-length even with the -w flag?

I think there is a POP version of pine but I am not sure.
However, Netscape can retrieve mail by POP.

Hello,

the insertion of a REPLY-To Field in the header seems to me to need a big
dive into the docs, since the whole header must be constructed....

Is there any hope, that
1 the environment variable REPLYTO is tested and assimilated
2 the modification to the header could be done incrementaly? sort of
merge...

in the next pine versions?

ciao

Perhaps it is more appropriate for the System Manager in charge of
installing and setting up Pine learn how to create the header (without a
value) in Pine's systemwide configuration file?  Users should then be able
to find it and set a value in the Setup Configuration screen with little
trouble.

Cheers,

The explanation is probably this: yakima.com is a news client of UUnet,
while deehoward.com is not:

bash$ host -a deehoward.com
deehoward.com           NS      DHC1.deehoward.com
deehoward.com           NS      NS2.TEXAS.NET
bash$ host -a yakima.com

yakima.com              NS      UUCP-GW-2.PA.DEC.COM

I am using Netscape when running X and elm when logging into through
telnet. I've set them up to use the same folders. The result is that i
can use them intermixed (not at the same time of course) without losing
any mail messages.

Good question. Or is there another way to subscribe to different 
newsgroups on different NNTP servers?

Is there a method for separating incoming mail by the To: header.  I am on
a couple of mailing lists and I would like to separate the mail from each
list so that it is received into its own folder.  If anyone can help with
this please email me directly at rds3y@virginia.edu.  Thank you.

I don't know the answer to your second question, but I, too, got annoyed with
Pine's insistence on moving files at the start of each month.  You can postpone
(but apparently not turn off) this behavior by manually editing your .pinerc
file (I use pico to do this).

Near the bottom of the file .pinerc (below the line that says "## Set within or
by Pine: No need to edit below this line ##") is a line that starts out with
"last-time-prune-questioned=" and you'll see that the value is year:month.  I've
set mine to 99.12 so I won't be bothered until the year 2000.

To get my mail from my service provider to my linux box, i use this short
script that runs popclient. 

#!/bin/sh
popclient -3 -k -u username -p password -o /var/spool/mail/username 
   service.provider.com

This works well for me. Try 'man popclient'.

Hello everyone,

I am using pine in an unix environment.
I would like to have for example the "Page down" and "Page Up" keys to 
act as "+" and "-" (when reading mail), i.e scroll down/up.
Is there anyway I can do this?

Thank you, \yvan

The attached script, configured as a sending-filter, will insert your
signature, preceded by a "-- " line, wherever you specify a
pre-determined token.  Here's how to use it,

1.  save the script in ~/bin/addsig (or whever you keep scripts);=20
Make sure it is executable.=20

2.  In the Setup/Config screen, add a sending-filter like

=09sending-filters =3D ~/bin/addsig token

where "token" is a string that prefixes a signature, e.g. --DLM

3.  Delete the entry in "signature-file"

4.  (opional) Select the compose-send-offers-first-filter feature

5.  When you compose a message, include a line beginning with whatever
token you configured in 2.

Now your signature will be after the token.  If you don't want the
token included in the output, change the first line of the gawk script
from
=09=09=09{
to
=09$1 !=3D token=09{

--DLM

Most linux distributions come with a utility called
popclient.  I know Debian linux 1.1 does.  Try "man
popclient" for help.  Outside of that, you can try naming a
folder collection with standard syntax + /pop3 to denote the
protocol in pine and it should retrieve the messages.  I'm
not sure if it deletes them from the POP server though.

Good luck

    Thanks for responding.  However, I was trying to do something a
little more exotic than just just open my inbox, which I can already 
do with an initial keystroke sequence on the command line (invoked with
a "hot key").  I deliberately avoid putting initial keystroke sequences
in my configuration simply because sometimes I want to start Pine with
different parameters at different times.  That's why I put the
different sequences for starting Pine on hot keys, and it was in trying
to develop the "exotic" startups that I encountered the cryptic and
unhelpful error message that the original poster did.

Hi!

Can anyone suggest some book titles on pine? I looked at the local book
store but couldn't find any.

The above tells Pine to use IMAP, not POP to access the folder.

	Some items of note:

1.	It is considered rude to use all upper-case in emails.  It is
	taken to represent SHOUTING.

2.	If you used pine for the first time recently, then you are
	prompted if you'd like to receive additonal documentation.
	Prehaps you answered "yes" and didn't notice?

3.	You will *not* be billed by washington.edu for the document.
	If your ISP bills you for traffic and/or messages received
	then they may bill you.

	Regards,
		Ed

Subject: Pine can't find user-domain?
Date: 9 Sep 1996 16:32:23 GMT
Message-Id: <511gqn$435@nntp.Stanford.EDU>

After a recent software system upgrade, pine began to report errors on 
startup, namely:
 
>   Incomplete maildomain "plato".
>   Return address in mail you send may be incorrect.

"plato" is the name of the hostmachine and the domain is stanford.edu. 
Since pine doesn't yield these errors on one of our other machines, with the 
same system software, I suspect there is a corrupt system file somewhere. 
We are using NeXTSTEP3.3 and the precompiled version of pine 
(pine-bin.next.Z) from the archive on ftp.cac.washington.edu.
Adding the line "user-domain=stanford.edu" doesn't seem to help; pine then 
appends the return addres "user@stanford.edu" rather than 
"user@plato.stanford.edu".  But adding "user-domain=plato.stanford.edu"
yields the correct return address.  However, we haven't had to add this file 
on our other system using the same system software. 
  Does anyone know where pine looks for the domain name on unix systems?
I am sure it can find the hostname "plato" from /etc/hostconfig.  But where 
does it get the rest of the domain name?
  Thanks for your help.
Ed

Yo Pine-Central,

   Any plans to distribute UNIX pine with a GNU autoconf/configure script
in future releases, instead of the "build xxx" form used now?  I sure would
like to see it.  I didn't see any mention of this topic anywhere in the
FAQ.

After installing 3.95, but still during the configuring of Pine some users
used the program before it knew what to do with the files. We send our
mail to our ISP via
UUCP. So generally when mail is in queue for delivery it's stored in:

/usr/spool/uucp/sover

But for those 24 -30 hours nothing.

Any thoughts on where the files (mail) could be??

   I have tried to use EMACS as the alternative editor. When I hit ^_ ,
the screen blinks momentarily and then gives me the message "Alternative
editor abnormally terminated (255)". Any suggestions?

	Guessing you have a shell account....on a U*IX box running 
sendmail....

	Create a file called .forward in your home directory (making
sure it is world-readable) containing the address of the alternate
mail account, e.g. other@foo.bar.com.

	For more information concerning the features of the .forward
file you can try consulting "man sendmail" or "man forward".  Your
milage will vary depending on your system....

Standard Unix Pine with no modifications can access pop3 mailboxes.
The syntax in .pinerc is ....
incoming-folders={pop3-host.domain/pop3}Label

For instance I have used .....

incoming-folders={facstaff.wisc.edu/pop3}FacStaff Mail
where facstaff.wisc.edu is the pop3 host, and "FacStaff Mail" was the
label I picked for that mailbox.

Not from within pine, but since you appear to be using X:
If you are starting pine with the command

xterm -e pine &

you might be able to define X resources specifically for the pine
window. The syntax appears to be something like (In your X resource
file, which on my account is .Xdefaults)

pine*Translations: <Key>Down: string("+") \n <KEY>Up: string("-")

I have not tested it though, so if it doesn't quite work check out the
xterm and xmodmap manual pages. You can also use xmodmap by itself to
do key remappings.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Can you use pine to set up a kill file?  I know it will filter To: and 
From:.  How do you do it?  I am using Pine 3.90.

Is there a FAQ for this newsgroup?  Where is it?

You will almost always get what you want if you set the nntp-server
variable and clear the news-collections variable in the Setup/Config
screen, e.g. 

	nntp-server=news.belnet.be
	news-collections=

Pine will then set news-collections to an appropriate default, which
is approximately

	news-collections=*{news.belnet.be/nntp}[*]

Yes. From the Main Menu choose "S" for Setup and "C" for Configuration, then
find the "customized-hdrs" section.  Add your "Approved:" header (with an
optional default value).  To access this header when composing a message, hit
CTRL-R (for Rich Headers) while in any header field.  To have this header shown
and accessible for every message you send, edit the "default-composer-hdrs"
section in your configuration to include this *and all other* headers you want
to show for every message (To:, Subject:, etc.).

Subject: Managing Unix message folders with Windows Pine
Date: 9 Sep 1996 14:53:16 -0400
Message-Id: <ii.842295090@shellx>

I've got tons of Unix message folders that are gzipped on my Unix
hosts.  I'm downloading them to my Windows machine and gunzipping them
and using Pine to read, reply-to, and reorganize them.  When I open up
these folders they are READONLY so I can't delete messages and they
don't flag messages that I answer.  One way to solve this problem is to
select all messages in a folder and then save them all to a new folder
(using `; a a s folder.new').  Then folder.new is not READONLY.  What
I'm wondering is if anyone has any suggestions for ways to speed up
this process of turning my Unix folders into read/writable Windows
folders.  Does anyone have any scripts or conversion tools to do this?
Also, I'm thinking that it might be better to use some other folder
format, e.g., MH format, so if you have suggestions in this area,
please let me know.

Thanks,
Nancy

Perhaps things could do with clarifying a little here? ...

Pine only offers to rename (and delete old versions of):

	* The "default-fcc" folder (used to automatically keep copies
	  of messages you send;

	* Any folders listed in the "pruned-folders" configuration
	  variable.

The periodic changing of the former is definitely sensible, to prevent it
accumulating indefinitely.  (I speak from experience:-)  [I trust you're
not using the "sent-mail" folder for saving messages you receive from
others?]

The latter only occurs if you explicitly set it up.

So I presume you're disliking the pruning of the sent-mail folder?  If so,
then you can certainly fool Pine into not pruning by setting the
"last-time-prune-questioned" appropriately (this will, presumably, affect
pruning of "pruned-folders" too).

However a better way of working might be to set up an entry in your
Address Book for people you correspond with regularly along with an fcc
for the entry.  This will override the default-fcc, and save any message
sent to to this recipient (as the first-named person in the "To:" field)
into the nominated folder directly (instead of the default "sent-mail").

Any other messages you send will get filed into the "sent-mail" folder
(courtesy of the "default-fcc" variable), which would then grow
indefinitely.  The monthly rotation of this folder helps serve as a
reminder that perhaps it is time for you to sort through the old
"sent-mail" folder(s) and delete any message copies you don't need any
longer (most of them, in my case, after a month or so!).  The remainder
can be re-saved to more relevant folders or back into the (current)
sent-mail folder.

Just a thought...

Cheers,

You cannot get Pine to do this automatically.

However you can do it semi-manually...

1.  Start composing your message now and get it all ready.

2.  DON'T type ^X (which would send the message immediately) but instead
    type ^O (Postpone).  This writes your still-being-worked-on message to
    a special folder.  Note: You can have several postponed several
    messages at a time, not just one.

Whenever you use the "C" (Compose) command Pine checks if there are any
messages in the special postponed messages folder and, if so, offers you
the chance to resume editing it.  So...

3.  At a later date give the "C" (Compose) command and resume editing your
    postponed message.

4.  Make any last minute changes that are needed.

5.  Send it by typing ^X (or cancel it with ^C, or postpone it again with
    ^O).

Cheers,

In setup/configuration, see what' set under "initial-key-stroke". I put an
"i" in there to open up my inbox upon opening pine. If you delete anything
that's set under that, you shouldn't get that error message.

I can't seem to add the References: header to the set of headers in Pine 3.94.
I have successfully added other headers, including custom headers.  The
References: header seems to be ignored by pine.

This header needs to be set by hand to follow-on while posting to news

P.S.  I have just read the other articles on this topic, including the one
in which a solution was found.  I have had reports of other programs than
Pine hanging too, though neither Pine nor anything else has ever hung for me.
I guess I'll continue with the AIX changes anyway, but it's good to know
there's an alternative if/when the problem does not go away.

If you enable the "print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt" option under your
configuration, you can get what you want (assuming you're using Unix) by
"printing" the e-mail message you're interested in using the custom print
command:

	cat | tail +n > filename

where n is the number of lines you want chopped off the top of the message (the
headers plus the blank line above the message).  At least, this is how I produce
the file "filename" containing message text and no headers.

The question was slightly different. What should I do, if I want
sci.electronics.design *and* comp.sys.atari.st in *one* collection? If I
define collection as {news.host}comp.[], there is no way to put also
sci.something in there; and if I define collection as {news.host}[], then
*all* groups will be in that collection - not very handy.

I already aske the same question - how can I make alt.security.pgp *and*
comp.security.pgp.[] appear as *one* collection? Without any other group
form comp.[] or alt.[] appearing there also?

I have several dozens groups defined splitted between different collection
- but I would like to keep logically related groups together. Currently it
is just not possible.

Any idea?

Subject: Address books


     I am installing Pine v3.95 under AIX/UNIX v3.2.5 and am trying to 
     create a global address book of our users.
     
     If I use the UNIX "vi" editor to look at the .addressbook file I 
     create inside of Pine, the file contains the following characters:
          nickname TAB username TAB address NEWLINE
     
     where "TAB" is the tab key, and NEWLINE is the end of the entry.
     
     However, if I create this same file by hand in the "vi" editor, or if 
     I build it from an existing list of users, the .addressbook does NOT 
     function the same way.  Pine refuses to properly call up a given user 
     if that username is defined in the "manually-created" method.
     
     What happens inside of Pine when I select one of these addresses is 
     that the Pine screen simply redisplays without having called up the 
     address into the "TO:" field.
     
     Am I missing something?  Why won't Pine accept an addressbook file 
     that I have created myself outside of Pine?

I do not think you are right. Try the following structure:

nickname TAB username TAB address TAB fcc TAB comment NEWLINE

You may leave the last two empty but include tha TAB separators (i.e.
every line contains (at least) four TAB's.

I think it should work now (we use script creating a global addressbook
from our password file).

Hmmm...  That is a considerably tougher problem that Pine does not yet
solve...

This sounds a bit complicated in two respects: first, you can use the
attachment menu as I explained in my other message.

Secondly, rather than printing to a custom command, you can use the
pipe command (|).

I don't know if there might be some differences in the final format
between the methods.

Oh, and thirdly, I think the "cat |" part is unnecessary.

Greetings,

I think if you use the attrib -r <filename> command at the dos prompt on
them (it takes wildcards) this should fix it. I think there is also a
Windows File manager menu choice for Attributes that will do the same
thing. Essentially you just need to turn the read-only flag off at the dos
level.

        I work for the University of Colorado and we're looking into the 
possibility of using IMAP for our primary mail systems.  Right now we're 
trying to find the best cross-platform (at least Mac and Win) IMAP client 
application.  Any input would be appriciated.

I am unable to print from pine anymore.  After viewing a message if I wish
to print it, I enter "Y"; pine asks me print message text using
"attached-to-ansi"?.  If I answer yes it waits a moment then tells me
print is completed, but nothing printed.  If I answer no it tells me the
print command was cancelled.  What am I doing wrong, or not doing?  I
could print previously.  Suggestions welcomed.

It was just brought to my attention that this specific case is
solvable in Pine 3.95 (and earlier) by specifying

	news-collections=[*security.pgp*]

I had forgotten that you can have both leading and trailing '*'s
insode the []...

     Mary:
     
     What system are you on?  UNIX?  Where is your printer?  On the 
     network, or directly attached to your terminal?  "attached-to-ansi" is 
     for printers that are hanging off the back of your terminal (or PC).
     
     To see what your default printer is currently set to, get into the 
     Pine/Setup/Printer screen.  Near the top of the screen, Pine will tell 
     you what the default is:
          Default printer currently set to "HP IIIsi (upstairs)"
     
     My guess is that it's set to "attached-to-ansi".
     
     Assuming you're on UNIX and want to round printouts to a network 
     printer:
     
          1.  Move down to the "Personally selected print command" line.
          2.  Press the <enter> key to select this as your default.
          3.  If your printer is not listed, ADD a printer name.
               On AIX/UNIX, my printer command is:  lp -dhpiiisi_1
     
     Hope this helps.

Pine is sort-of 2000 safe here, but you need to set it to =105.12 to
wait until 2006 ;-)

The background-sending feature was added at the last minute and is
still pretty primitive.  I would like to stress that this is an
_experimental_ feature!

You should set:

	printer=lpr

in your ~/.pinerc file. You'll find this statement around the middle of the
.pinerc file.

Yes, the famous Unix (or any system running sendmail, really) .foward 
file will do this and more for you.  If, for example, you wanted to run a 
program that pages you whenever you receive, mail, you can get the 
.forward file to do this for you as well. 

Unfortunately, I forget the syntax used in the .forward file for more 
complex actions, and I cannot find this info with a couple hours 
searching for it.  I will go to further lengths perhaps and post back 
what I find.  However, I would suggest that this is not a Pine problem, 
and that another comp.mail.* newsgroup is more appropriate.

       I am only on 3.94, but unless version 3.95 made some catastrophic
   changes, from the Main Menu go to Setup and Config.  Scroll down to
   customized-hrs and add the  Reply-to: ...  that you want.  (When in

As in 3.94 you have to add all headers you want incl. those "standard"

Assuming you're in Unix at the shell prompt in your login directory, the command

  cat bob >> mail/bob

will add the contents of file bob in your login directory to file bob in your
mail directory.  The command

  rm bob

will then delete file bob from your home directory.

If you want to *replace* file bob in the mail directory with file bob from the
login directory (instead of adding them together), use a single ">" instead of
the double one above.

Is there any way in Pine 3.94 to compose mail to all of the entries in my
addressbook. For example, I recently changed my phone number and would
like to send one message to everybody with the new number. I can't find a
way to do this - does anyone out there have any idea? TIA

Hi, usually when I get e-mail messages I save them in a "saved mail"
folder.  When I went to view my saved mail my folder was not there.  My
saved mail folder has been established for a couple of weeks now.  I don't
understand what happened.  Could you help me or direct me to someone who
could?  Thank you for your cooperation.

Pine will not let me save my messages.  It says that it can't create a
certain mailbox because there is no such file or directory.
Please help me.

Hi,

I recently transfered overseas and (unfortunately) I now
manage a network of HP/UX 9.0.3 systems.  So, I downloaded
my favorite mail reader (precompiled for hpux9) and tried to
set up an imap connection back to NJ.  I was running Solaris
2.5 there with pine 3.94 (and associated 3.94 thingies).  I
had an imap connection set up fro home there and it worked
great (pine 3.94 client on Debian linux 1.1 over ppp).
However, the HP version kept prompting me for a passwd
everytime I did anything.  Usually this would only happen
once.  So I took the advise of another from this list and
canged the host name to the IP address, but no improvement.
I then decided to sync up the pine versions, so I upgraded
the Solaris machine to pine3.95 (and impad, etc), butthis
made things worse.  Now the HP tries to connect but never
comes back from that.  The bar just keeps twirling.
I'm now telnetting into the solaris machine from here, which
works OK, but I'd rather have a local editing session and
only have to deal with slow connectivity for folder
management, etc.  We have a 256kb connection, which is very
usable normally.  I need to get this working somewhat
reliably or I'll never be able to sell imap as a remote mail
server solution.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks.

Richard,
First thought: if the rsh to the imap server times out, it will
prompt for passwd, so maybe the rsh to the server is failing.

You can try to invoke the remote imapd manually and see what happens... 
The syntax is:  rsh host-name /etc/rimapd

	Your question is a bit cryptic.

	You don't say what platform you are using.  You don't give
any indication on your environment and you don't say exactly what
pine is telling you.

	Kind of like asking:  When I try to start my vehicle it makes
a noise, what is wrong?

Actually, qmail-pop3d works reliably over NFS. (It's dedicated to
maildir format. maildir is nice for programmers because it doesn't need
any locking beyond the kernel's automatic low-level directory locking.)

qmail-pop3d also uses no temporary files, can serve any size mailbox,
supports APOP and UIDL, imposes no limits on lines or characters, and
has a hook for your favorite authentication scheme. It's much smaller
than cucipop.

It does sound like you have the best available mbox-based POP server.

Yikes. Does it also automatically tell the users what it's doing? ``I
will irrevocably destroy your mail, before you've seen it, if your
connection drops at the wrong moment.''

A strange behaviour:

I open a news folder (e.g. comp.mail.pine) and after reading the
articles, I Delete and eXclude all of them.

The next day, when I open the folder again, Pine 3.95 (Sun OS) 
shows not only the new articles which have arrived but also the
ones I have deleted the previous day!

I've compared the contents of .newsrc before and after article
exclusion and it seems to be updated correctly:

Contents of .newsrc at folder openning
=======================================

comp.mail.pine: 1-12146, 12148-12149, 12151, 12153-12165,
12167-12177, 12179-12183,12185-12236,12238-12248,12250-12255

Contents of .newsrc after exclusion of all articles:
====================================================

comp.mail.pine: 1-12325

So, if .newsrc is updated correctly, how do the excluded articles
get resurrected the next day?

Has someone else experienced the same problem?

Well, this seems to work, but I don't know how pine handles
the fact that my username is different.  It was connecting
before though.  As far as timing out goes, I think that's
unlikely since my Debian system was working fine with pine
as an imap client of the same Solaris machine just last week
in the US over a 28.8 modem line running PPP.  That was much
slower than what I have here.

I just did a ^D to get out of this :-(

Thanks again for any help.  By the way, I tried stripping
the binaries (on both sides) but it had no effect.  I don't
have anything like trace or truss on this HP/UX
unfortunately.

WE SEEM TO BE HAVING DATE PROBLEMS IN PINE 3.87 ON UNIX 3.2.4.2.  WHEN A
USER SENDS AN E-MAIL THE PROPER DATE IS IN THE DATE SENT FIELD OF MMDF BUT
WHEN ANOTHER USER RECEIVES THE MESSAGE THE DATE FOR RECEIVED IS INCORRECT. 
USUALLY A DATE 20 YEARS AGO.

THIS CAUSES A PROBLEM IN THAT PINE 3.87 USES THE RECEIVED DATE TO DISPLAY

HAS ANYONE HAD THIS PROBLEM OR ANY IDEA OF WHERE TO BEGIN TO LOOK?

I HAVE ALREADY CHECKED THE SYSTEM DATE AND ITS IS SET TO THE CORRECT DATE

I don't know about the best but having installed and run Simeon on a
University site and done the same with Pine I would certainly recommend
the latter over the former.

Both have problems with bugs in new releases, but Pines are fixed
quickly, help is always available and its free. (Simeon is available
very very cheaply to the academic community in the UK).

The IMAP server from Washington is very robust and seems to work with
all clients. My experience of Simeon's server was not a happy one.

Unfortunately Windows users tend to prefer the Simeon style of Windows
client (that old look and feel) but if exposed to the functionality of
Pine first that problem can be avoided. 

I'm not sure if there is a port of Pine to the Mac, there are certainly
versions available for DOS, Windows, UNIX and VMS.

I guess there must be more options out there now. When you do make a
choice I'd very much like to know which way its goes and if possible the
deciding factors.

My mail repository, and pine folders, are on a DEC-Unix 3.2 machine in
Edinburgh, Scotland, which runs an IMAP server. I frequently work at CERN,
Geneva, where I use an HP workstation. The networking is not too great,
but is no worse than usual.

Both sites recently upgraded from pine 3.91 to pine 3.95. Now, when I
access my mail from CERN, the IMAP connection is dropped (by the client, I
believe, from the pine-debug file) at certain defined points. The result
is that I have to provide my login name and password each time I need a
buffer to compose a message, and twice when I complete the message -- once
to send it, and again to write it to sent-mail. There is no problem in
reading messages.

As you may imagine, this situation is a real pain. Any ideas? The CERN
computer centre refused to comment, since Edinburgh was running IMAP2bis.
So we changed to IMAP4, and as you can guess, nothing improved.

I'm afraid therer isn't a port of Pine to the Mac.

However a couple of good possibilities are:

Mail Drop -- Free, from ftp://ackmo.baylor.edu/pub/bell/Mail_Drop/
	(go for the latest beta version)

Mulberry -- commercial (but cheap, and with bulk licences available)
	Contact: Cyrus Daboo <cd102@phy.cam.ac.uk>
	A demo version is probably available.

It's worth checking out the IMAP Connection information centre at:

	http://www.imap.org/

One tip: watch out for wolf IMAP client software in sheeps clothing.  I
once tried POPmail III for the Mac as it supported POP2, POP3 and IMAP.
Howevr I found it used IMAP in a POP-like manner, using it to simply rip
all the messages off the IMAP server and transfer/access them from the
Mac's local hard disk.  This defeats the philosophy of IMAP of allowing
the messages to remain on the central server and be manipulated in situ.

Cheers,

Change the definition of your INBOX and folder collections (of everything
what is remote) so they look like

{bla.bla.bla.edinburg.uk/user=3Dimapuser}INBOX,

where imapuser is your username ay Edinburg and INBOX (in case of folder
collections) is replaced by the name of he folder collection, etc.

It should help.

I am unable to find a way to use Unix Pine 3.95 to call a remote host and
access emails from its IMAP server.  Is this operation allowed/supported?
Can you give me a clue?
 
Thanks a lot for your help!

In case it matters, I am using Pine on an SGI machine, under Irix 5.3.

Subject: Re[2]: Address books


     Thank you everyone who made suggestions on how to use the UNIX 
     /etc/passwd list of users to create an .addressbook file (especially 
     Vladim Solnick).
     
     The problem is that creating a text file with only FULLNAME and 
     ADDRESS is not enough.  A NICKNAME field must also be included.  The 
     following is the script I used to create the .addressbook file:
     
     #!/bin/sh
     # File:  pine-addressbook
     # What:  Create a new global addressbook for the Pine email system.
     echo "Creating global address list for Pine ..."
     cut -d: -f1,5 /etc/passwd | tr ' ' '_' | tr ':' ' ' | \
     awk '{ 
          print $1 "\t" $2 "\t" $1"@companyname.com" "\t" "\t"
          }' > /tmp/.addressbook.tmp
     tr '_' ' ' < /tmp/.addressbook.tmp > /tmp/.addressbook.new
     echo "1.  The new global Pine address book is:  /tmp/.addressbook.new"
     echo "2.  Be sure to edit out the 'garbage' email addresses, first."
     echo "3.  Then, move it into /usr/local/lib/.addressbook"
     ## EOF
     
     That is all there is to it.  Now, when a user presses the RETURN key on an 
     address in the addressbook, the address pops into the "TO:" field like it 
     should (all because of the NICKNAME field).

I do not think you are right. Try the following structure:

nickname TAB username TAB address TAB fcc TAB comment NEWLINE

You may leave the last two empty but include tha TAB separators (i.e.
every line contains (at least) four TAB's.

I think it should work now (we use script creating a global addressbook
from our password file).

I recently upgraded from 3.91 to 3.95 now my users' say that the
terminal emulation seems to be broken. When they read mail they
get double lines, the cursor will not be where it appears. 

Things were fine in 3.91. I installed a precompiled pine for Solaris
2.4. Ideas?

Yes.  Pine assumes that you're planning on placing your reply above the text
you're replying to, so it puts you on a blank line with a blank line to separate
your text from the original message.  If you always put your reply after
instead, go into your configuration and "x" the option that says:

		[ ]  signature-at-bottom

That should do it.  It also, obviously, puts your .signature file at the bottom
if you're having it automatically inserted.

OK, we've now seen two reports in the past 24 hours of problems with rsh
preauthentication when accessing an IMAP server from an HP workstation.  

 o Have either of you tried the suggestion of using /user= syntax?
   If it solves the problem, I won't know why, but that's OK...

 o Do either of you have any non-HP boxes you can try?

 o Once you get logged in, is everything OK? 
   (I assume if you bypass rsh, using the :143 syntax, everything
   works as expected, except the rsh preauthentication, of course.)

 o I gather it works sometimes but not other times, and that in both cases
   there is substantial distance between client and server.  This suggests
   a timing-dependent problem (as well as apparently being HP specific.)

 o If you revert to 3.91 on the HP (IMAP client), does the problem go
   away?

 o If you increase the rsh timeout (need to edit the pinerc for this)
   does it make any difference?

 o Any other HP users with useful info?  (either successes or failures?)

David, regarding Pine asking you multiple times for name/password:
please check your pinerc to make sure all references to the remote
imap server "look the same", e.g. use the same symbolic name in all cases.
If so, Pine *should* remember the name/passwd for subsequent connections
to the *same* server for the duration of the session.  But if the
hostnames (in inbox, incoming folders, folder collections) have
different forms, Pine will definitely prompt you again.

Read the help file on Distribution lists. 

Basically it's a plain text file with one address per line. Pegasus
allows you to automate the process whereby people on the list can send
messages themselves to the list without your intervention (apart from
you having to log on to collect mail).

Hope this helps a little.

Are you trying to specify that as a folder-collection?  That won't
work because POP3 only supports one folder, INBOX.  The only places it
makes sense to list a POP3 reference is in inbox-path or
incoming-folders, where you would use

	{machine.dom/pop3}INBOX

Hope that helps!

That's curious.  3.95 is primarily bug fixes from 3.94.  I can't imagine
why anyone would prefer 3.94, with known crash-type bugs (and known bugs 
in filters!), to 3.95.

I found on my HD last night 3.95 for Linux. It was the binary for it and
runs great. I don't remember where I got it tho. If you're interested, I
can make it avail via anon-ftp. Let me know if you (or anyone else) wants
the binary vers. I don't have the source code.

There are some known problems with 3.95, but the serious ones seem to be
platform-specific, so (fortunately) not everyone is seeing them.
A couple that come to mind:

 o Display problems on AIX 4.2 (this is fixed by a small change to
   the build script for pico to use terminfo instead of termcap)

 o Wedging the whole OS on Solaris.  This seems to be a bug in a
   Sun library, tickled by a zero-byte read.  A patch was posted
   to this list a while back.

Is there anyway to change the default so that the "I" - Index line is

Anyone ever encounter this.  I use Tin for news reading.  I reply to one 
post typing in a long reply.  But later checking my Pine inbox, I get a 
message referring to mail delivery problems.

So now what to do?  If the reply failed, then I might as well post the 
message to usenet.  But I don't want to go and type it in again.  Maybe 
several pages.  There ought to be a way around this.

This is working okay for me too, Harry.  There is a message that does
flash in the way that Paul described, but mine say "executing initial

Has anyone reported problems with this feature?  I set it up when I first
saw it but assume it's safer to disable it if it's still considered
"experimental."

I never had this problem when I was using Tin.  As a suggestion, accessing
the newsgroups through Pine gets better & better everytime!  There are
lots of shortcuts to switch back & forth between news & mail and the Tin
delay time in reading the .newsrc file is non-existent.

OK well from pine you go to the Main Menu "M" and then type "S" for setup. 
And then you can type "C" for change configuration.

I am new to Pine, so forgive me if this is an abvious question, but how
do I get new mail to show up right away?  Currently I have to "up arrow"
to get it to appear.

the toggle in eudora is
"ReplyAttribution=..."

to change a reply intro from "at [time/date], [user] wrote:" to something
customizable and possibly a little more annoying.

what is the toggle for pine 3.95?  i can't seem to  find one.

please email to:atsai@fas.harvard.edu

Yep. Two options.

1. Put "Reply-to:ness@scf.usc.edu" in the customised headers bar.

2. Compile pine yourself (A good chance to upgrade to 3.9.5 anyway), and
enabled ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM at compile time, then put
"From:ness@scf.usc.edu" in the custom headers option bar.

I use the latter. As an aside, such a wide crosspost was unnecessary,
since comp.mail.pine is the ideal group for this question ;)

I installed it systemwide several weeks ago, and haven't seen any
problems, and have had no complaints from users.

Yes, either get a version of Pine that isn't quite so ancient, or edit
your .pinerc to add a personal name entry.

I am using pine on MkLinux.

When I open pine, I get a message (at the inbox screen) saying that my
mailbox is opened by another process. Access is read-only.
However, of course, if I su to root and run pine, it works fine.
What can I do to restore pine to its normal functioning?

Thanks for any help

I use pine in tandem with a 'crontab' (cron is a utility to schedule
jobs) entry that has popclient in the command field.  It works fine.

Well I like Tin better.  With Pine you have to wade through many 
individual messages.  I get some delay time with either program though.  
Takes about 30 seconds to read that file when starting Tin.

My question is not about a problem with the program.  I just wish there 
was some real simple way to deal with the situation where the e-mail 
address of some person given by the news server is not correct.  I wish 
there was a simple way of posting that message once you find out there 
was a mail delivery problem, since replying by e-mail did not work.

    To the best of my knowledge, generic (i.e., not modified at the
source code level) Pine does not currently allow you to change the
reply attribution on a global basis.  You can always edit the
attribution of each message individually when you are in the message
editor.  (I occasionally do this when I am replying to a mailing list
which is not conducted in English.)

Marleigh,

I've seen several reports of trouble from your site today.  It looks
like there were problems with the upgrade to Pine 3.95.....

You should also include "pine -create_lu" call to make the .lu file. 
Otherwise all of your users will be creating temporary .lu files each
time they run Pine....

I have attempted to ask this question three times with my local support
staff but have not received a reply from them.  The server was just
upgraded to a "new" version of time--maybe do to a recent hack but I
thought that it was prior to that insident.  Anyway, prior to this
revision I was "talking" to several people in the same domain (different
than mine) without much trouble.  Every since this new pine version I
can't reach a single one of those friends via my shell account...I have to
use a specific talk program that I downloaded.  I keep getting "waiting
for invitation of caller's machine"...everytime, even when I know the
person is not online.  When I use my "talk" program then I can usually
connect to that same person right away...any suggestions on why this is
behaving this way...could it be my configuration that I need to change or
is there something that I can request be done about this??
thank you for you time

p.s. please use the signature address not the reply one...when that hack
occured the security was to make us blind to the world by using the
"gotta@guess" address.

Go into one of the preferences things (don't have a mac handy), and

The FreePine project (a now divergant Pine development stream due to
sad circumstances) is doing so, but the autoconf for it is embrionic at
the moment.  It would  be nice if UW Pine would also try to do this.

  You can export the bounced e-mail into a file. Then use a text editor to
delete all the e-mail headers, with only the message body remaining in the
file. When you enter TIN to compose your follow-up, include (or import) 
this file into your article.
  If your text editor is Pico, press ^R to import the text file; if Vi,
type ":r filename".
  Hope this helps.

You can run ps and grep for pine session and kill them.  You are only

Pine and other mailer put a file lock on /var/spool/mail/$user.mailbox

I don't think so.  But you can have it automatically do the I option by
setting 
	initial-keystrokes=i
in the configuration menu.  The syntax is not necessarily right, but close
enough so you can find it.

There is an excellent utility available from sunsite called fetchpop. This
can run as either a daemon or a command line to get mail from a specific
pop server. It stores its preferences in a file which keeps your user name
and password encrypted. Very good for security purposes. Suggest you try
it out.

Of course since it appears you are logging in as Root.  Create an
account in your username name as that of your e-mail and log in as Root
and connect. Then log in as ness.

Yes there is.  in sendmail.cf change the "masquerade" line into:
DMscf.usc.edu       OR
DMusa.net

Your messages will appear as though they are comnig from ness@usa.net or

In addition, some may find it useful to know that on slack 3.0, running
2.0.12 kernel, 3.95 will compile fine under linux. I can't speak for other
systems, but I would assume a similar situation. :)

I don't have any magic solutions, but it does sound like a problem we
need to look into.  Could get a stack trace and send it to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu?  (after a crash, run "gdb pine core" and
give the "where" command)

To avoid the rsh timeout, either explicitly specify the port when you
reference the server, e.g.

	inbox-path = {server:143}INBOX

or specify rsh-timeout=0 in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.

3.90 and 3.91 (and maybe 3.* < 3.90 too) had a bug in POP 3 code. Use 3.9=

If you're on a Unix system, another possibility is to try changing
your /etc/passwd info by using the chfn command.  I think Pine uses
this info for the default full name (does someone know if that's true?)
For some more info about customizing headers see my "Signature, Finger,
and Customized Headers FAQ," which is accessible from either of these:

Good luck,

I haven't really heard of any serious problems with background
sending, but I have no idea how many people are actually using it
either.  One thing to watch out for is that it is possible to lose a
message if Pine encounters a problem (e.g. /tmp gets full, you get
disconnected, ...) 

It is not used unless you specifically tell Pine to use it (after
pressing ^X, note the key menu), so it should be safe to enable it. 
We would also like to hear user feedback about how it works, so if you
do try it and have any problems, please let us know!

You can do this with pine.  Go into the main menu (M) then set-up (S)
then config (C) and look for default-fcc.  Use pine's help facility from
there.

I just found a great new feature of Pine:
enable-background-sending  in Configure

Then, when sending, you have the option to let the system deliver it at
its leasure.

My only question is, however, does it attempt more than once if the server
is so busy that the send command bounces back?  It doesn't seem to here,
it sends a message saying to go back to compose and resend it.  I didn't
do anything, and it never tried again for the next 5 minutes.  It would
seem to me to be true a "background" operation to continue attempting on
its own.

IMHO,

Message-Id: <516b3n$ns7@news.nstn.ca>

     We are in the process of setting up a freenet site.  One of our
concerns is disk space (of course).  Already we can see that some
members are not deleting old messages and have large mail-boxes.
One suggestion is to prevent them from sending new messages until
they reduce the disk space used for their old messages (after suitable
warnings).  We did not want to totally disable their mail or purge
their mail-boxes automatically as they could have important messages
coming in or may be saving special information.  Is there a way in
pine to disable "Compose Messages" for individual users?

Dale,
One of the things that changed after 3.91 (for *some* OS platforms)
was a switch from using the termcap database to the terminfo database.
I can't recall if Solaris is in the group that we understood would be
better served by terminfo, but I think most anything with heavy Unix
SytemV influence got that treatment.

Any chance your terminfo database is faulty for the terminal types in
question?

Have the script (or program) that builds the global addressbook issue
the following command

	pine -create_lu addressbook order

where "addressbook" is the name (or pathname) of the global
addressbook file and "order" is one of the choices listed in the
Setup/Config screen under sort-key.

Well, I was using Pine 3.95 and for some reason i deleted my
Saved-Messages folder and I can't seem to find them. I'm a student at SDSU
and I use telnet to get into the UNIX 4.0 server at school.  How do I go
about recovering this info? Any help would be appreciated.  Please

Hi,

I added the Reply-to (actually I've been trying to do that for a long
time now) and whenever I read the message in pine, the reply-to tag is
not recognized but other mailers like NetScape do recognize the same
tag. My mistake was I was always trying to read the message thru pine
and thought that I was making some mistake. 

How do I get pine to recognize pine to use the reply-to address. 

BTW, I tried an interesting expt. I sent a mail to one of my accounts
from pine and from netscape with the Reply-To tags and used pine to read
the mails. For the mail received from pine; the reply-to tag was not
recognized while for the netscape one, it was. (I saw the mail file in
vi editor and saw that both the lines had the same syntax. Then I copied
the reply-to line from the netscape part of the mail and copied it to
the mail from the pine and restarted pine. This time it recognized the
reply-to tag. Any comments??

We are using HP9000 running UNIX.  Would you tell me how to suppress all 
names in a mailing list?  It is rediculous that one sentence comes after 
2 pages of email addresses.  :-)

Since this system is just put in, our CIS personnel could not help me.  
You are my last hope.  :)

	Currently I have pc-pine 3.95 set up so that all messages I send
get copied into a SentMail folder.  What I would like to do is to be able
to save sent messages into different folders depending on what they were
about, etc.

	Is there any way I can have pine ask me which folder I would like
to copy the message to as I am sending it or something.  I know about the
Fcc field on my address book but I would rather classify them by what they
are about than by who I am sending them to.

	Any suggestions much appreciated.

	Please reply by email to S.Oldfield@nla.gov.au.

Thanks in advance
Simon Oldfield

	Wild-assed guess here, based on my own experience.  The problem
was probably caused by something your service provider did or didn't do. 
Shit happens. Somebody flips a switch.  Somebody makes an error when
reconfiguring something. Somebody falls over a wire. Somebody spills his
coffee into the works. Lightning strikes something important.  Happens all
the time, but it's just part of the game.  

	Try to repeat what you did as soon as possible.  If it burps
again, try to email or phone your provider immediately and tell him what
happened.  It's really annoying that error messages disappear so quickly.
Can your terminal software do scrollbacks?  Procomm (pcplus) can, and I'd
guess that most other software can do it too.  Really useful for LOTS of
stuff that passes by too quickly to see.

| Should I  quit using Pine ?  Is this common with pine ?

	Not common, and probably doesn't have anything to do with pine. 
I've used it on two different systems in 3 years, and like it a lot.  Easy
to use, capable, etc.  (BTW, there may be a file called something like
dead.letter in your home directory or maybe your mail directory -- pine
tries to save things for you if it can.  If it's there, copy it to some
other filename before it gets overwritten by another dead letter, and
you're back in business.) 

| What's the best way to avoid this in the future ?  Nix telnet and pay for
| a real telephone call ?  

	Don't know how to avoid it, but your provider(s) might be able to
explain what happened.  If you're writing something long, you might either
save it frequently or compose it off-line and upload it when you log in. 
(Yeah, like I do it *all* the time myself!  Like I've never lost
*anything* because I'm always soooooo careful!)

Sure. In the configuration menu, set initial-keystrokes=UP 
See the help text behind the initial-keystrokes option.

I'm using the Win32 winsock version of PC Pine.

Whenever I try to attach to a message, it seems that PC Pine has
real trouble with filenames that have spaces. The short-term
solution is to use the 8.3 filename of course, but this is
awkward because it's easier to be able to pick a file from a
list.

Are there any plans to fix this?

	I've not tried PC-Pine....but do you have any better luck if
you enclose the filename in quotes?

Check your pinerc file, there is a section in there for custom headers. 
In there, add a Reply-To: field, and put the email address you want

Perhaps you need to set some different startup flags in the setup?

Have you tried it with "enable-alternate-editor-explicitly" (or whatever)
set?  This causes it to automatically give you your preferred editor
whenever it would give you pico.  I have set jove.

Could you please repost this or give information on where to find it.  A
disk crash ate my news archives a few weeks ago.

Is the specific posted fix incorporated in future versions of pine?

Currently I have frozen GMI at 3.91 because of specific bugs in each version
since 3.91.

Thank you. In fact, I got the hint to use "{bla.bla/user=me}INBOX}" within
an hour from Vladimir Solnicky in Prague, and my problem was solved. My
login names at home (mail repository) and at CERN are different. 

By the way, if you go to the folder-list screen (command L) and type ? it
tells you about allowable specifications, *not* including "/user=".

I have a problem saving an attachment. At the end of this posting I have
appended a mail sent to myself showing the problem. The attachment is a
text file, sent to me as type application/octet stream, and it is NOT
base64 encoded. The original file has lines ending in LF characters, as
is normal for UNIX system. However, when I save or view the attachment
PINE adds CR (^M) characters! This is clearly wrong, since PINE should
never try to modify (presumably) binary files. I am running PINE 3.95 on
a SunOS Unix box. I can forward the mail exhibiting the problem to any
interested parties.

The questions: is this a bug or a feature, and how can I correct this
behaviour?

You're using Pine to post to the usenet?  Try using tin - the right
program for the right job.  Chances are you lost connection with the
newsserver if you took a long time to make a post but knowing what the
error message was would help - a whole lot.  Trying to figure out the
answer to a problem when the only clue is "It didn't work" is not that
easy. 

Also - it's very rare that the response time using my shell account is
that delayed.  It happens now and then for a few seconds but not 30-90
seconds.  If you're looking for a place to lay blame, it sounds like
something is wrong with the configuration of your comm program, modem
settings or port configuration.  I don't think those LONG delays are a
regular thing.  Is anyone else having those sort of problems?

Hello, I'm running sendmail on slackware 3.0 and everything appears to be 
working fine with the exception of one user from his provider.  I was running 
sendmail on a Sun Sparc, but after changing to linux this problem has popped 
up.   It appears that sendmail is pulling off a header or something which shows
his actual account ID from his ISP.  The mail appears to be from mail05955 
where it was showing up as preilly@isoquantic.com.  Thanks in advance.

Three points: First - since this is cross-posted to comp.mail.pine, I
should note that Mr. Danbury telnets into our system from another state,
from a disjoint network. So sluggishness/choppiness could occur anywhere
along the path from there to here and back again. 

Second: MCI issued an advisory concerning assorted routing problems across
their backbone at about the time that Mr. Danbury was experiencing
difficulties. So I would assume that that is what was causing the problems
at that time.

Third: Here's a traceroute I just ran to the site Mr. Danbury connects
from. I think there may be serious problems elsewhere...

I'm attempting to use Pine as a POP client from this freenet with Pine 
3.91, but the result seems to be that the other machines must be running 
IMAP.  Since I am not administering one of the other machines, it would 
be really nice if Pine could access the POP port directly, without this 
IMAP thing.  Is this possible?

The syntax I am using is:

{machine.dom/pop3}[]

Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, and information on where to obtain the software, can
   be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer -- whichever organization provided you with the
   email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number of
   Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users.
   
   University of Washington Pine users, please contact your departmental
   computer support staff; or send email to: help@cac.washington.edu
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   http://www.smartpages.com/faqs/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.

   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.

  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as popclient can be used to download
   email from a POP server to a local Unix account, where it can then be
   accessed with Pine. One location from which popclient can be obtained
   is:
   ftp://ftp.mal.com/pub/pop/
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

There is an archive of pine-info/comp.mail.pine at

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
or	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/

I posted the Solaris patch in question on 4 Sep.

The patch disables a sanity test that was added recently and is only
intended as a bandaid until Sun comes out with a patch to fix
STREAMS...

Could you elaborate on the bugs that are preventing your upgrade to
Pine 3.95?  Other than the above mentioned problems, we believe it to
be more stable than Pine 3.91...

I'm using pine 3.95 on SunOS 4.1.  As a rule, I use emacs as the
alternate editor when sending messages.  When emacs is launched, it's
working directory is the machine wide temporary directory /tmp .

As it often happens that I'd like to include parts of files in my
messages, this is annoying, as the emacs include-command starts
looking at /tmp, and I have to manually redirect the path to my
home-directory.

What I want is to tell emacs to start with my home-directory as
"current working directory".  Is this possible?  I've searched the
setup menues and the web pages at http://www.washington.edu/pine/ but
found nothing!

Please tell me how to accomplish this!

This may be because you are using your root account for email. Try setting up an account with your real email name, and it might work. Good luck.

it it says "Folder "Friends" does not exist".  If I try to create a

Or you can set the environment variables HOSTNAME and LOGNAME to the
correct values. You should make a .login file in your home directory
that looks like this (or the variables will be reset to their default
each time you log on):

  #/bin/csh

  setenv HOSTNAME usa.net
  setenv LOGNAME ness

Hello!

Thought I would alert you all to a possible bug.  While typing messages I
will occasionally get the following types of displays:

	ex. 1:  at[14;36H least .....
	ex. 2:  do(backspace arrow)16;52Hn't

I have also had where I type the word "there" only to find the "th" above
the "To:" prompt.  Have others had this problem?  I am wondering if it
truly IS a bug in the pine program or with my communication software.
Anyone (notice the present bug?  I typed "anyone" and an "A" stayed on the
line above.  The reason I ask if it could be my software is because I
recently changed from ProComm (old version for 286) to COMit for 286 &
Dos.  The problem I have found with both softwares though is that things
will freeze up and I can't use the backspace to delete.  I usually have to
type over an error with any letters, THEN I can backspace.

I'd be interested in any feedback you could provide.

Ingrid
 :-)

David,
Glad to hear the problem is solved.

(I hadn't thought the /user= syntax would solve it because I had
understood that the problem was intermittant; sometimes you got prompted,
sometimes not.  Glad I was wrong!) 

The /user stuff was added after the help text for folder collections was 
written; we need to update it.

This solves the problem.  sorry ;-)

Yes, solaris 2.5.  Works fine.  Debian GNU/linux 1.1 works fine too.

How is this done?

Incidentally, I can't seem to get pine to use the SMTP host
defined.  I'm registered to this host with our firewall and
need to send from it to get outside.  I seem to be sending
from the local workstation.  My SMTP line looks like this on
the HP client:

smtp-server=123.456.789.10

Of course, the real address is used.

Thanks again.

Checking "enable-alternate-editor-cmd" just allows you to use an alternate
editor if you press Ctrl-space.  You need to check
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly for it to always kick in.

I was wondering if it is possible to use the "Take Address" function (or 
something similar to add an address to a distribution list.  Pine always 
wants to add the address as an individual.  Am I missing something or is 
this just the way Pine is?  Please respond to 
"gjhickel@server.wulaw.wustl.edu" as I don't always keep up on reading 
this newsgroup.  Thanks!

    And I am using Pine 3.94 on SunOS 4.1.4, so our environments are
very close.

    I wonder if this might be a problem with emacs, which I am not
familiar with.  I use JOE 2.8 all the time as my alternate editor under
Pine (comes up automatically).  When JOE starts, such as when I began
this reply, the working directory is /tmp, just as you are saying, as
shown by the status bar displayed on the top of my screen.  However,
any command I give to or pass though JOE that involves the working
directory uses whatever was the current directory when I started Pine. 
For example, if I want to import a file without specifying a path, the
file will not be imported from /tmp but rather from whatever is the
"underlying" working directory when Pine started.

    That's why I speculate your problem may have something to do with
the connection specifically between emacs and Pine.

I realize that pine uses the mime.types file to decide on what MIME type an attachment
should be, but I'd really like to see if there is the ability to use (something like)
the "file" comand (including the "magic" file) to drive MIME types.
  
It would probably be more bullet proof than simple file extensions, esp. under Unix.

As an example, I attached a simple text file, and it came out as
"application/octet-stream" instead of "text/plain" because (a) I didn't have an
extension and (b) I didn't have any extention in the mime.types file for "text/plain".
While that's OK behaviour, and I know that "a/o-s" is fine, it would be
nice to use a "file" mechanism, which reads a few bytes, and MIME types accordingly.
Of course, it's not idiot proof (like on html files), so perhaps using the mime.types
file first, then use "file"?

Has anyone done this (or thought about this as a future enhancement) before I launch
into doing the code?

Please reply via E-mail.  I don't get much chance to read news :-(.

Yes, this can be done.  If you're in the message whose address you want to
save, select Take Address.  When prompted for the nickname to save, select
To Address Book and then scroll through until you find the name of your
list, hit return and you'll get the question about adding the name to the
list.

(Regarding: tring to attach a file that has spaces in its name)

Thanks for the response. Yes, I tried quotes, and I tried
replacing the spaces with underscores, and I tried the
combination of both. Sometimes it seems to work at first, but
when I press ^X to send, it says "problem with attachment."

However, if I enter the "alias" filename, it works.

For example, suppose I want to attach a file called "Little
Picture.gif." I press ^J and enter "c:\pictures\Little
Picture.gif" (without the quotes). Pine doesn't like it. But if I
use "c:\pictures\little~1.gif" (the 8.3 alias), it works.

When you use ^T to pop up a list of files, it uses the Win32
common dialog box (which uses long filenames). This is a problem
because if you pick a file from the list, it inserts it correctly
onto the "attachment" header line in Pine, but it won't let you
send it.

This is probably something the Pine development team will want to
fix...

Only when I telnet to shell.wco.com from work through the proxy... Delays are both 
noticeable and annoying, but it's more the proxy's fault than wco's...

Yes, I find an average savings of 12%. Of course, maildir is designed
simply to solve the reliability problems of mbox and mh for incoming
messages; long-term storage should use a completely different format,
with compressed messages and hashed indices.

Hi,

Of course, you can ,

First, set your favorite printer using "S" Setup on the main menu,
then choose the task P[Printer] and update the printer command you
expect to use (someting like lpr -Pprinter_name if you are using UNIX)..

Then, when you are reading your mail, choose O (Other command) and
Y (prYnt). Then pine will ask you "lpr -Pprinter_name "? [Yes] or [No]..

Good luck

Jean

I'm curious about your IMAP server experiences with VMS. I use the IMAP server 
of PMDF (Innosoft) and have problems with copying Email from local folders to 
the remote VMS-mail folders. It's not possible while a Unix IMAP server has no 
problems at all.

I've experienced this lately. When I use the alternate editor (PFE) after 
saving and sending the Email message I receive the error; [MAIL FOLDER "INBOX" 
CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR]. I've also noticed that this happens sometimes 
after bouncing Email. Normally I've no problems at all, my IMAP connection 
stays open all day.

PC-Pine 3.95 (obtained as PCP_PCT.ZIP) fails to connect to our IMAP
servers -- both IMAP2bis and IMAP4 -- no matter how many minutes I let
it wait.  Rolling back to 3.91 (PCPINE_F.ZIP), I am able to connect to
both servers.  Is this version of PC-Pine broken?

BTW, 3.95 displays my remote account and password at the left end of its
status line for the first 15 seconds that it tries to connect. :^(

Can I really be the only one experiencing this?

The SunOS4 code has a major bug in some pipe code somewhere. This affects
mailcap reading, use of pipe by the user. pine just hangs (forever).
I'm going back to 3.93 (having put the security patches in for mode 666 files 
myself). Removing the mailcap files gave me more stability at the loss of some 
functionality (I could live with it) but loss of a reliable pipe command is
a bit much....

I have also tried checking both the ..cmd and the ..implicitly and
indeed it kicks into the compose and then drops into emacs (my default
editor). It seems to work the same without the ..cmd checked as
well. Is there something that the added check under
enable-alternate-editor-cmd is supposed to do? It would logically seem
redundant to use both. Invoking emacs takes a little longer but pico
is so similar that it is often hard to switch languages without
stumbling.

Hi! The school just installed a new version of Pine (sorry, don't know the
version number).  Now I can't seem to get the configuration to put my name
in when I post to newsgroups - intead it says "To: ..." (see this message
in your mail index).  Before the upgrade, this was working just fine, so I
don't know if the upgrade messed up something or if I did.  Help!!!
(Thanks!)

hi
i'm installing pine on my SUN machine and having this problem. When any
user is trying to use it ,it displays an error message saying
'incomplete mail domain "hostname" return address in mail you send maybe
incorrect ' . Of course every user can get into the setup and fix that.
The question is how do I do that globally ? 
Thanks 
bye

Um, I don't think I left anything out... merely said I think the proxy at 
work slows it down. I don't allow my users modem connections (for security
reasons), and I don't do it myself, to set the example.

I am using Linux pine 3.95.  When I browse an index and mark several
messages as deleted, and start reading, or go back from reading to the
index, pine often stops and does something that requires lots of disk
accessing (maybe it is checkpointing the mailbox).  It is not swapping
pages in virtual memory, and there is no banner saying what it is doing,
but it will lock up for several seconds to a minute (the more messages the
longer), but remember keystrokes.  Expunging takes the same amount of
time, but isn't any faster after one of these apopletic seizures.

Why does it do this, and how do I make it stop.

If you use PC at home, use PC-Pine.

If you use Macintosh, MailDrop probably does it.  The alpha version works
very well on my Q650 and 6100/66 machines.  I don't like the 1.1 for lack
of features.

Pine thinks that there is no point in displaying to YOU the from
info of messages that YOU send, so for those it displays info
about who they are to.  The rest of the world sees those messages
as from Keiko (who has a signature three times as long as the
actual message sent).

So don't worry.  Pine is sending messages with the correct From info.

I believe your question was how to resend a failed message without
having to retype to message.  Particularly when the original was
sent from a news reader such as tin.

There are two questions, really:

  Q: What to do about people who post to news with bad reply-addresses?

  A: I wish I knew.  Beyond scolding them gently (and without a proper
     email for them this can be difficult), there really is nothign to do.

  Q:  When I get a bounce message, how do I resend it?

  A:  If you have a better guess at the address of where to send it, you
      can try Forward and then change the subject line (remove tthe
      "(fwd)", edit out the mailer daemon junk in the body, and send it to
      the new guess of an address.

The .lu file created by the command line option does not seem to
be acceptable to pine.  This has made setting up a global address book
very annoying to automate.

I believe that I posted a detailed account of this problem a while back.

It is the most serious bug to date.

Some limitations have severe consequences:

If the xterm features are set, but a user runs in a DXTerm on Ultrix
(and possibly OSF) it fails dramatically.  The entire DXterm window
freezes and must be killed externally.

It would be nice if the failure were more graceful, since I would love
to put the xterm features in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf .

I reported a truly minor bug about the warning messages about
dropped NNTP connections beging displayed as messages about
dropped SMTP connections.  I recieved a perfectly satisfying answer to
that and it is hard to imagine that anyone would think that that
was in anyway a reason not to upgrade

Subject: [Q] imapd problem

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I am trying to get imapd working on our new HPUX 10.01 system. I
downloaded the latest (3.95) stuff and compiled with no problems. Pine and
Pico work great. When I try to access this machine with imapd, however, I
run into problems. It asks for a login and password, thinks for a minute
and then says:
		 [Bad LOGIN user name and/or password]  
and then
		[CLOSED - Imap connection broken] (or something like that)

which to me seems like it at least gets through to the port.  I have
checked: 

1) my password IS correct (I even changed it a few times to be sure!)
2) inetd.conf IS correct (and restarted)
3) /etc/services IS correct
4) as a last resort I even did chmod 755 imapd! (to no avail)

Imapd (3.95) worked great out of the box on our 9.04 system, so I am
wondering if the different way passwords are handled on 10.01 is the
culprit. Has anyone run into this yet? Thanks for any help......

Message-Id: <51ms06$47n@news1.io.org>

Need advice on sending e-mail with file attachment from a PC platform to 
a Mac platform.  I am using a 286 with DOS.  The e-mail reaches the 
destination but not the uploaded file.  I am told I should cut and paste 
the file content into the e-mail message, but I don't think I can cut and 
paste with 286 DOS.  What about converting the file - a WordPerfect 5.1 
file - into a DOS file or TEXT file?  How would I do that?  Any other 
suggestions?

Thanks,

I am accesing the Internet from behind a firewall and my local
NNTP server for USENET news does not carry a few newsgroups that I am 
interested in.
 I know that there are tons of public access NNTP servers out there that
I can avail of but I cannot specify them in the nntp-server= variable
because I am behind a firewall.
  How do I overcome this problem? How can I tell Pine to access
a public access NNTP server through my firewall. I am accessing
'telnet' and 'ftp' through 'ptelnet' and 'pftp' i.e. through a proxy defined
on the firewall machines(s). 
 
Help.

It appears that my problems are due to our "trusted" system. Has anyone
whacked the code for imapd or popper to work with HP-UX 10.X trusted
systems? I would be forever in your debt....

Subject: New patch available to kill threads of subjects
Date: 17 Sep 96 20:43:14 GMT
Message-Id: <paulb.842992994@linda>


I asked my boss if I could release this patch I made to pine to the
world as a freebie which hopefully others will improve.  He said fine
so it is available.  It kills subject threads now and for 30 days.
Please read the disclaimer at the end of this message.  In short, if it
blows up your mailbox it's your problem.

The patch is at ftp://ftp.teleport.com/users/paulb/pine/kill-patch 
To apply it you will need gnu patch.  It is patched against pine3.95
but might work with other versions of pine.  Just go to your 
pine3.95/pine directory and type patch < kill-patch and do another
build.  Here is the announcement I sent to the employees here.

=====================================================================

Announcing the Kill command.  Are you sick of reading about particular
subjects which you have no interest in?  Press K.  This will mark the
subject deleted and hidden.  Then when you quit pine and it asks if you
want to expunge articles say yes and those messages are gone.  The
subject is also written to a kill file.  For 30 days any subject marked
with a K will be automatically deleted and hidden when you enter your
inbox.

This is all you need to know unless you hit K by mistake.  If you do,
then hit Z.  This toggles zoom (Pine's word for hiding groups of
messages).  The messages you just marked deleted will now be unhidden.
Arrow to the ones you want and press U to undelete them.

The subject you really wanted is still in your killfile.  Press # to
edit it.  Take the subject line out that you want to read in the future
by arrowing down to it and pressing Control-K to delete the line.
Press Control-X as shown on the bottom to exit.  Pico will say "Save
modified buffer?".  Answer 'y'.  Then it will say "File name to write?
: /home/yourname/.pinekill".  Press Enter.

Please let me know if you find any bugs.  On one hand I have spent a
fair amount of time trying to ensure there aren't any.  On the other
hand there are around ten pages of new code, a lot of which involve
calling pine routines, some of which I don't fully understand.

Enjoy!

I'm actually referring to traditional mbox dotlocking.  For maildir
format, this is, of course, not needed.

Undoubtedly, because it doesn't have to parse the mbox format.
There is an advantage (despite its many shortcomings) to mbox over the
maildir format, BTW, especially to your typical mailserver that has lots
of POP3 readers and not all that many shell users:  the mbox format uses
a lot less space on typical filesystems (less block slack) and fewer inodes.

It takes a reasonable stab at detecting these "wrong" moments and
tries not to delete the message currently being transferred.
But, there is a risk, yes.  In any case, the behaviour is completely
optional and definitely not the default, and of course clearly
marked in the man pages as violating RFC1939.  Nonetheless, it is useful
for some environments, which is why I included it.

As for telling the user..., it indeed displays a message of this kind
as the mail is being retrieved.  The problem is that if the user
is using a typical POP3 client, this message will, of course, not
be displayed to the user.

This would be a nice suggestion for Pine, however, you can do pretty much
the same in Unix using the following awk script.  Copy everything between the
lines into a file named:  everyone 

-------------%< clip --------------
{
    printf("everyone\tEveryone\t(");  
  
    if ( $0 ~ /\(/ )
        continue
    else
        printf("%s", $1);  

    while ( getline > 0 ) {
        if ( $0 ~ /\(/ )
            continue
        else
            printf(",%s", $1);
    }
    printf(")\n"); 
}
-------------%< clip --------------

Now, type the following exactly at the Unix prompt:

awk -f everyone < ~/.addressbook >> ~/.addressbook && echo Done.

You may wish to first copy your ~/.addressbook file to a backup file, 
before executing this command. 

If everything went well, it should say Done.  When you start Pine, there
should now be a list in your address book with the name:  everyone,
containing all of your address book nicknames (but NOT other lists).

Yep.  X'ing the setup option "enable-alternate-editor-cmd" only gets you the
*ability* to invoke an editor other than pico using the ^_ command.  If you want
to have the alternate editor be your default editor, you need to also X the
"enable-alternate-editor-implicitly" option found immediately below the first in
the setup screen.

As of now, you can pick up a new POP3-daemon that has been especially
optimised for heavy loads (e.g. your typical ISP setup).

cucipop v1.10

It can currently be picked up as:

ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/cucipop/cucipop.tar.gz

Feature summary for cucipop:
	+ It's fast (optimised for frequently polling POP3 clients)
	+ It's less filling (i.e. small)
	+ Does not use *any* temporary files (which also means that the
	  startup time is spectacularly short, and there can never be
	  any stale temporary files or doubled mailboxes)
	+ It can therefore serve *any* size mailbox without requiring
	  additional storage beyond what the file already occupies
	+ A fully compliant, all frills attached, RFC1939 implementation of
	  the POP3 protocol
	+ This means that it supports APOP *and* UIDL
	+ It includes the option to sabotage the UIDL command (to defeat
	  undesirable "Leave mail on server" clients)
	+ It also supports an optional autodelete mechanism, so that any
	  RETReived message is automatically deleted
	+ Autoadaptive, simply start it and it will know if it has been
	  started from inetd or as a standalone daemon
	+ Security conscious, i.e. the APOP support, already has hooks
	  for shadowpasswords, and defeats password guessers by an adaptive
	  verification delay
	+ Supports both BSD and SysV (Content-Length) mailbox formats
	+ Is the only popd to perform reliable mailbox locking across
	  NFS as well (it uses the same excellent and proven locking
	  algorithms as does procmail)
	+ Provides flexible logging of statistics and auditing events
	+ Does not impose *any* limits on line lengths, mail length,
	  or the use of any character (any 8-bit character, including '\0' is
	  allowed) in the mail
	+ Secure system mailbox handling
	+ Has hooks to ease moving the mailboxes to any location you'd like
	+ Has hooks for other authentication schemes (e.g. Radius)
	+ Has hooks to virtualise the popserver
	+ It runs on any POSIX and ANSI C compliant system
	+ Is clock skew immune (e.g. in the case of NFS mounted mailboxes)

Assume the spammer's address is spammer@somewhere.com, you email to
postmaster@somewhere.com and complain.  Of course, you want to make
sure you include the full headered email from the spammer as a
supporting evidence.

If the spammer uses anonymous service to email you, you can email the
anonymous service postmaster and request your address be blocked so 
that no future email will come from that service to you.  It works.
Hopefully, the spammer will run out of anonymous servers ... :-)

I am just wondering why it is that  I don't recieve all of my messages.
It appears that my mail is getting lost for some unknown reason and if
somebody could tell me why this is happening to me, or where it may be
going and how I can get it so I can reply to people I'd really appreciate
it.
                                             Thanks.

You can access an inbox in *online* mode, with reduced functionality,
via the following syntax in your pinerc:

 inbox-path={pop.server.name/pop}INBOX

However, I'm skeptical of what you were told about IMAP and security.

Could you find out more (or put us in touch with someone who knows) about
the alleged security hole?  It is possible that there is a security hole
in a particular IMAP server (and if it's ours, we want to know about it),
but there are lots of server choices now, and it is extremely unlikely
that the protocol itself is the problem.  (Indeed, in normal use, it is
better to use online access via IMAP than have repeated connections to
check for new mail via POP, as the latter scenario involves sending your
passwd over the net --usually in the clear-- many more times.)

yeah, but that sure wasn't easy to see.  (i use pop3)
btw, i gotta move fast - PINE keeps dying evertime it realizes PPP
is off (as it restarts - auto/ondemand mode)

fbsd 2.1.5 / pine 3.95 - not subscribed!

i may run into him again, i'll note your comment on fbsd's lists

had to do with csh aliasing his client as the server ... ?

Here is a simple ELM to PINE alias converter that I have written in C if
anyone cares.  Several of my people were using ELM and we have switched to
PINE.  So we needed a way to convert all the aliases. 

It will append new aliases from ~/.elm/aliases.txt to ~/.addressbook if it
exists (after warning that it already exists). 

If ~/.addressbook does not exist, it creates it and puts aliases from
~/.elm/aliases.txt in it.

If ~/.elm/aliases.txt does not exist, it prompts you for a remote computer
from which to fetch ~/.elm/aliases.txt.

The source code is attached.  Hope this helps... 

Regards,
Bob

You only need to type
   build <osname>
<osname> stands for the OS where you want pine to build.
It is a 3-letter flag of the suffixes you see by typing
             ls pine/makefile.???

Eamples:
1)           build sol
  for Solaris 2.x whith cc-compiler
2)           build gso
  for Solaris 2.x whith gcc-compiler
3)           build lnx
  for Linux

Check the terminal emulation settings.  Some terminal emulations
assign a special meaning to ctrl-X.

Try sending ESC ESC X instead of ctrl-X

Can't think of any othe rsuggestions at the mo.

	Where can I get some information on installing pine on a unix 
system?  

Can I just install it on my own dir?  Or does it have to be intall by 
the system admin?  

Thanks for any info, John

Subject: Can pine fetch remote POP accounts?
Date: 18 Sep 1996 18:13:20 GMT
Message-Id: <51pe40$mbb@herald.concentric.net>

Hi... I use pine for my work account and Eudora to fetch mail from my POP
accounts at home.

I was wondering... is it possible to use pine to fetch mail from remote
POP accounts? If so, what is the syntax? And this would be even nicer: is
it possible to get it to fetch mail but leave it on the remote POP server
so that I can still get that mail at home.

Thanks for any suggestions. If possible, please cc: a copy of your
response to my e-mail below.

It looks like you have added the text to your signature file. I could be
wrong. But a good way to check...goto Main Menu    [S] setup then [S]
signature and it will show you what's in the signature file.

And I'm tired of confirming everything before I do it. 

Actually sending out a letter is not such a monumental event that it should
require a second thought (and confirmation). When I'm done with a letter, I
want to hit ^X and be done with it. 

I know that most of the "confirm before doing" options can be turned off.
Why can't we turn off all of them?

A friend of mine has asked me recently who pays for the net (for example
who pays new connections between to countries), and I
couldn't tell him exactly, so I thought I could find it on the Web, but I
can't find anything about it there.
Could anyone tell me where I can find an article about it?

hi. i have a question about displaying pictures sent to me via email.  it
seems that i am unable to access them for some reason.  i have a macintosh
performa 637cd.  and the following is the description of the image sent:
subtype- JPEG, Encoding- BASE64, Approx.size- 12,199 bytes, display
method-unknown format.  i have no idea what any of this means, but perhaps
it will hold some significance to you. if you could help me out that would
be very much appreciated. thanks.  amy kim

Dear Sir,

I have a problem with PINE 3.95 ( I believe ) installed on Stanford
University Leland machine: when I tried to forward a msg, the original
message was not included, which is really annoying. Is there a way to fix
that by changing setting?

Thanks a lot!

Best regards,

yy

	You will *best* be served by going (from the Main Menu) to

Boy, did I really mess up today.  I was at a friend's house (a Netscape
user) and decided to try logging into my account (we share the same ISP).
Little did I know that his system is set to download all messages off the
server.

So, I go home & log into Pine as usual and, guess what??  No messages!  I
called him right away & he had all of my mail on his system, so we get the
bright idea that he could forward them to my address (which he did) but
now I've got one message with 55 attachments!!  Some I want to save,
others I don't... what are my options??  <groan>

Just a pleasant reminder of why I still access the net through a shell
account, I suppose.

|Fcc field on my address book but I would rather classify them by what they
|are about than by who I am sending them to.

I haven't found a slick way, but every once in a while I open the folder I
keep my sent mail in and (s)ave each message into a different appropriate
file.

I don't know it this is the right news group, but I'll try it once.

I have a problem printing with pine. Pine itself runs on a UNIX machine, 
to which I connect from a PC. The PC is on a network and therefore prints 
to a network printer. Now, whenever one of the PCs on the network print 
from pine, an additional page come after each printed e-mail/message. On 
each page there are always the same three characters. 
Does any body have an idea where the bug could be? By the way this thing 
just recently started happening, after upgrading the network to LANWork 5.

Thank's for any help,
Chris

every few minutes.  all my other Inet stuff is fine.

2. can't delete messages off my isp server.  is there any other way
to delete messages off my server other than telnetting in to my isp
and other than running a popclient?  nothing to just move the INBOX
off the server to my pc?

thanks.

i apologize if this is a duplicate.  pine keeps crashing on me,
can't tell if my last post was sent.

i get randomly timed messages -Problem detected "abort signal received"-
pine 3.95 / fbsd 2.1.5  my other inet stuff is ok.

also, is there no other way other than a popclient to delete messages?
isn't there someway to have pine transfer & delete my INBOX on my
isp's server?

thank you - please reply by email ...

i tried pine e-mail, just once, yesterday.  and since then i have received
221 messages from you--all the same exact message, 221 times.  since i
have logged on today i have received 11 more of the same fucking message.

stop it.
now.

i don't know if this is an accident, or if it is not your fault...either
way, i do not care. 
if you do not know how to prevent this annoying, frustrating incident from
occuring again, ask someone for help, or tell me where i can get help with
this.  

if i have not made myself very clear, let me do so now...

stop sending your messages to me.  
do not send me anything.
ever.

also, i will be sure to notify the next 10 e-mail users i see today at my
university that if they try out your pine e-mail, they may encounter the
same frustrating affair that i have encountered.

once again...just stop it.  a reply is not necessary, just stop it.

I've just tried searching the archives of this list and couldn't find an
answer to this problem.  We've created a batch of student accounts which
will be using Pine 3.93 on a RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.5.  The .profile
takes the students directly into Pine and then logs them off the system
when they type "Q" - so they're not allowed to the Unix prompt at all.
For some reason, these students are being logged off the system after 2
minutes of inactivity.  I've been looking for some sort of timeout value
in Pine's configuration, but I haven't been able to find anything so far.
I don't believe it could be at the Unix level.  However, our regular user
accounts *don't* sign off after inactive periods.  Also, some of these
student accounts don't sign off.  We've comparing every system file in the
student accounts line by line, but so far have found no differences.  Has
anyone else ever encountered this problem?

The best you can do at this point is use TAB to cycle through the incoming
folders.  It will only stop and open the folder if there are new messages.

If you go to your Config setup (Main, then "s" then "c") and go down until
you see "character-set=", you can then insert a different one there.

Aha!  Recent versions of Pine try to figure out if it is still
connected to a user by checking the parent process-id to see if it is
process 1 (init).  If it is, Pine assumes that the user was
disconnected and Pine somehow missed the SIGHUP.  This was implemented
to handle a problem of zombie Pine sessions on some systems...

The most likely cause of this is that the shell that started Pine
exited for some reason.  It is possible that the shell doesn't set up
all of the signal handlers before sourcing .profile.  It is also
possible that the shell is responding to a signal from a process that
Pine forked.

Does that give you any clues?  If not, please send a copy of your
script(s) and configuration to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.

The binary, and source, for 3.95 (linux binary, and source which compiles
fine), are on the ftp.cac.washington.edu site. :)

Switch on the "use-alternate-editor" option, and put vi in the slot for
"alternate-editor" down the bottom of the config screen? :)

specify certain incoming mail to go to certain folders?  Is this a 
feature of version 3.95 ( I'm using 3.94)?

Please respond by mail.

Thanks,

I am using Linux pine 3.95.  When I browse an index and mark several
messages as deleted, and start reading, or go back from reading to the
index, pine often stops and does something that requires lots of disk
accessing (maybe it is checkpointing the mailbox).  It is not swapping
pages in virtual memory, and there is no banner saying what it is doing,
but it will lock up for several seconds to a minute (the more messages the
longer), but remember keystrokes.  Expunging takes the same amount of
time, but isn't any faster after one of these apopletic seizures.

Why does it do this, and how do I make it stop.

Wild-assed guess:  Your .pinerc file directs that your mail be saved into
a file in a non-existent subdirectory.  I think pine defaults to someting
like ~/Mail/saved-mail.  If the subdirectory (Mail) doesn't exist, it
can't save any files into it.  Check your configuration.

Or you can set the environment variables HOSTNAME and LOGNAME to the
correct values. You should make a .login file in your home directory
that looks like this (or the variables will be reset to their default
each time you log on):

  #/bin/csh

  setenv HOSTNAME usa.net
  setenv LOGNAME ness

One way to see if Pine is doing a checkpoint is to "enable-mail-check-cue"
Then you'll see one asterisk in the upper left corner while it is checking
for new mail, and two asterisks while it is checkpointing the mailbox
state.

I'm using telnet, and so I have become accustomed to the cursor not
responding to my keystrokes.  I have also become accustomed to waiting for
actions to occur; frequently 30-to-90 seconds or so.

Tonight I just spent about 15 minutes composing a message to a newsgroup.

I gave pine the send command, and the little  "propeller" did its thing
for a long time, then told me  that something went wrong, and that was the
end of the whole thing.  

I could not receive the test of the message.  

I also could not receive the text of the error; I believe that I remember
something about the word "connection" in there.

So, anyway, did I cause this error ?  Did my service provider cause this
error ?  Did  pine cause this error ?

Should I  quit using Pine ?  Is this common with pine ?



Oh, incidentally, the subject of the article was dealing with internic,
and the  newsgroup was the thing on domains, I don't have scrolling turned
on my software here, so I can't give all the details like I want to do.

Anyway, whom is the most likely  culprit in this event, me ?  My service
provider ?  Pine ?  internic ?  Gumby and Pokey ?

What's the best way to avoid this in the future ?  Nix telnet and pay for
a real telephone call ?  


Thanks go to anyone who provides answers and advice which work in real
life.

Clint

How about just typing F for forward and then ^R for rich headers
and then type the news group name(s) in the Newsgrps header, edit
the subject so that it is what it was in the bounced message and
then edit the message so that it's what you want to post and post
it using ^X.  This is one of the many advantages of Pine being
both a mailer and news reader.

Note that this will not post the References header, which means
it won't be threaded correctly by threaded news readers, but since
it's a rare event, I say go for it!

Yes.  The default inbox is "Inbox".  If you change to
"{you@remote.com/POP3}Inbox", you access the remote host via POP3.  You
can also use IMAP if the remote host supports it (my school's server
does).  In that case, you omit the "/POP3" qualifier.

If you server does IMAP, and you access mail at home using PC/DOS/WIN,
there is PC-Pine.  If you use Mac, there is a MailDrop from Baylor Univ. 
They all can do IMAP.  PC-Pine can do POP3 also.

The best you can do at this point is use TAB to cycle through the incoming
folders.  It will only stop and open the folder if there are new messages.

Is there an option to do circle scan? I find the prompt at the end of the
scan quite annoying. I would like to specify 2 more options to the
behaviour of the scan: at end of scan return to inbox and at end of scan
stay in actual folder.

Is this already implemented?

exerpt out of my .bashrc:
LISTBOXES=`find /home/bboett/mail -type f |sed 's/\(.*\)/\1?"New mail in

since i answered the first one too:
out of my .deliver:
#!/bin/sh

SENDER=`cat $HEADER | grep "From " | cut -d' ' -f 2`
case $SENDER in
*pine*)  cat $HEADER $BODY >>/home/bboett/mail/pine_in; echo DROP;;    
*) echo $SENDER > sender; echo "$1"
esac


When using deliver You have to know, that there are 3 environment variable
defined: SENDER, where's the From: field (unsuitable for discussion lists,
therefore my redefinition...)
HEADER where's stored the header of the mail and
BODY where's the body of the mail.

Hi there, thanks for reading this.

This week I have built pine3.95 on our RS6000 ,AIX 3.2.1.

It seems to run ok, but messages like "domain name incorrect"
and "return mail address might be wrong" are displayedon the menu.

The problem :-
When sending mail CTRL X (as I remember), pine locks solid
and I have to eventually kill the process.

Any ideas, I would appriaciate help

No one on this list/newsgroup has yet agreed with me, but I think that as
Usenet users we should all voluntarily cooperate with conventions even if 
pine doesn't.

pine gives us the opportunity to customize our headers. If I use pine to 
post news, or post an article via a mail-to-news gateway, I add the 
Message ID of the article I am referencing by cutting the Message-ID into 
the References: header.

To make this easier, I add "References: " to my customized composer 
headers, and "Message-ID: " to my customized viewer headers. I wish there 
were a way to overcome pine's limitation preventing the user from adding 
additional message IDs to the "In-Reply-To: " header. Like "References: ",
the RFC implies that "In-Reply-To: " can contain the message IDs of each 
message being referenced in the reply.

(As always, I've also added my own meaningless "References: " and 
"In-Reply-To: " headers to the body of my message, as mail-to-news 
gateways do not always pass all the headers through.)

Hi there.

Somehow, since upgrading the whole linux system, I have problems with
the mail system.

Whenever somebody sends a mail, the from-field will be filled with
<user-id>@<domainname> instead of <userid>@<hostname>.<domainname>

I checked sending mail with sendmail, and that works fine...

Any suggestions?

Hiran

Corrections:
 1. Using Pine with POP3 does not result in all messages being fetched,
    with the implication that they can be viewed after disconnecting.
    (Pine does not yet support offline operation.)  However, that also
    means that nothing gets deleted from the server unless you explicitly 
    mark it deleted.
 2. PC-Pine does not yet support POP.

Bruno,
These options are not yet available.  

Question about suggestion 1: So you just want to avoid the prompt and
have "Return to INBOX?" be implicit?

Question about suggestion 2: I'm not clear on which folder you want to
stay in.  As you know, Pine stays in the last one with recent messages,
or by prompt takes you back to the inbox.  Are you saying you'd like
options equivalent to "always say yes" and "always say no" to the prompt?

exactly, should be an option as delete_without_confirm etc...

yes exactly, when scanning other inboxes, if no other new mail is found, i
am prompted if i want to return into inbox. I would then like to say
default behaviour is Yes i want or no, without beeing prompted. But for the
'no'option this would be useful only if scanning was circular...

I have been experimenting with Pine 3.95 on our HP (hpux 9.04) 
and have experienced unpredictable delays in sending messages.
This morning I noticed the following diagnostic message which 
perhpas will provide a clue regarding some of the intermittent delays.

"Can't write in directory containing .addressbook.lu, using temp file"

Can anyone tell me what this message refers to. My setup configuration has
defaults for local addressbook, and /usr/local/lib for the global
addressbook.

What do you use to filter your messages?  With procmail, you can 
use mailstat to tell you about new messages.  With filter, you
can use `filter -s'.  See my Filtering Mail FAQ for details:

Howdy All,
I've been messing with PC-Pine for quite awhile and can't seem to get to
an inbox. I've tried at least a dozen different inbox-path settings with
no luck. The best thing I get is:
([CLOSED]) imap connection broken (server response)

Is it possible to add a password to {domain.name/user=marcw}. I've heard
reference to passwords but don't know how it's set.
Anyhind, I've asked my ISP about the PC-Pine problem and haven't received
a response yet. As you can see I can read/compose news (and compose email
via news) but can't do email email. 

Any tips?
Danke,
Marc

Hi folks,

	After having used a DEC Alpha (and pine as my mail tool) for a 
while, now I'm back at home with my PC. I liked the program so I was 
interested in running it on my home computer.
	However, I just can't get it to work ok. After configuring it I 
get the following error:

No inbox!  Folder to open as inbox :

and it stops prompting for a new name.

	I'd be really thankful to anybody helping me setting up the 
first fields in the 'config' screen. These are my email account data ...

	Real name : 		Daniel Villar
	Email address : 	dvillar@jet.es
	POP3 server :		jet.es
	login : 		dvillar
	SMTP server :		correo.jet.es
	
	Is there a way of getting rid of the message and making it work?
Mail OnNet is not that bad for dealing with the mail and so far, it's 
proved to do the job, but apart from being used to pine, I never liked a 
lot those fancy GUIs with drag and drop facilities. 

	Any help please? Thanks very much in advance.

P.S.: If useful, both servers are supposed to be Linux boxes.

Thanks for your advice, Nathan, but I tried that four different ways and 
couldn't get it to work.  The best it would do is come up as "Reply:" on 
the rich text header.  I tried the following:
Reply to: <corn0060@gold.tc.umn.edu>
Replyto: <corn0060@gold.tc.umn.edu>
Replyto: Bruce Cornelius <corn0060@gold.tc.umn.edu>
Replyto:<corn0060@gold.tc.umn.edu>
The first one should have worked but it just gave me the "Reply" under 
the rich text and it never showed up on messages.  I am using PINE 
3.91, and it's on another acccount.  AARRGGH

The information you need to add is:

Reply-To: corn0060@gold.tc.umn.edu

and you can skip the angle brackets. You may not have spaces in header

Would anyone care to speculate what a detached pine process on
BSDi would be doing to consume two thousand CPU minutes?

I see several of these regularly on a system I visit.

Spamming? Junk Mailing? Some kind of hack? The amount of outbound

Any thoughts would be appreciated, particularly by E-mail.

Presumably looping on some event that is never going to happen...

Is this happening with version 3.95?

If so, please sig QUIT one of the suckers and send a stack trace

I am a real computer illiterate, but something has happened that I don't
know how to fix.  I have been using Pine for almost a year, and when
opening up a newsgroup, on the board in the "From" column, my name always
appeared next to the thread subject.  Just last week, I switched over to
the "new" Isis system, which the university is requiring us to do.  All
went well, but when I post to a ng now, instead of seeing my name, there
appears a "to. & then the name of the ng."  I went into Set-Up,
Configuration, but I don't see anything there that I can relate to in that
area.  Is there a simple way to correct this problem?  I would certainly
appreciate any help - I called our "Help Desk," but the person there
didn't have a clue, and she said someone will have to get back to me, but
it may be "quite awhile."

Thanks,

Sally

    I am trying to pass this on to the Pine Development Team as a
possible bug report.  I apologize for posting it, but I cannot use the
normal bug reporting process, because my service provider goofed and
misconfigured the bug reporting screens off the main menu.  (I reported
this to my help desk in early August and followed up on it, but they
still haven't gotten around to fixing the goof.)

    The configuration is Pine 3.94 under SunOS 4.1.4.  News is read via
an nntp server.

    It has happened several times that I will be reading Usenet news
with Pine.  When I finish with one newsgroup, I delete and expunge all
the articles and press TAB to go on to the next group listed in my
.newsrc file.  Normally there is no problem, but occasionally something
has happened in the connection with the news server.  The little task
indicator whirls and whirls, and eventually the connection suffers a
timeout with an appropriate message.  Unfortunately, instead of just
stopping at that point and doing something like returning to the folder
list screen, Pine attempts to GO ON TO THE NEXT NEWSGROUP, where the
same thing happens.  Eventually it would futilely attempt to go through
all my unread newsgroups.

    Unfortunately, I cannot find a way to break out of this deadly
situation short of crudely breaking my dialup telephone connection and
terminating my shell session by brute force.  This, of course, is a
real pain.  Is there a bug in V3.94 such that it will not recognize and
honor Ctrl-C when Pine is trying to open a newsgroup?  Is there some
other way to break out of this situation (even terminating Pine as
such) so I can get out of this kind of deadly embrace?  (If the reply
is to upgrade to 3.95, my service provider has already rejected that
on the ground that 3.95 is buggy, as I mentioned in an earlier post.)

Thanks.

    Not with Pine as such.  A 'vacation' reply is part of the mail
*delivery* process.  Pine gets into the picture as part of the mail
*reading* process after delivery is complete (skipping sending for
now).  Therefore, you need something that hooks into the delivery
process.  If you are using Pine under some flavor of Un*x operating
system then you can use 'vacation' itself (or something a little
dressier, like 'procmail').  If you are on a different system, you will
have to use some other process I am not familiar with.

    Nancy McGough has a lot of good material on her WWW pages.  I don't
remember the top URL, but I have a link in my home page.

Use a POP client (I use popclient on linux), and make it retrive your mail
box for you. My popclient call is thus:

#!/bin/sh
popclient -3 -v -uUSENAME -pPASSWORD -c 194.145.1.31 >> /var/spool/mail/root

It's a feature, for your own reference, enjoy it! <g>

Basically it means you can easily tell which posts / mails are *from*
yourself, so you can skip over them without reading them.. purely a
convenience thing. :)

Seems that there was some mention of this last month.  Apparently, there's
a unique program that's NOT part of Pine called "vacation."  What I recall
is that you need to execute it from the root directory, and not all ISPs
provide thi p[rogram.

Good luck!

I've experienced this situation as well, Paul.  The only way out for me
has been to break the line connection and log in again.

Subject: How to specify build arguments?
Date: 19 Sep 1996 21:37:17 GMT
Message-Id: <51seed$k47@listserv.rice.edu>

I'm just about to build pine on three different architectures (Sun 4,
Solaris 2.5, and Irix 5.3).  I'm trying to specify make arguments to
build, but they don't really seem to work.

Specifically, under sun if I give
'./build CC=gcc sun'  It eventually runs 'echo cc > CCTYPE' and proceeds
to run using cc.  Similar attempts to specify debugging or Cflags also
fail. 

I also tried setting the environment variable CC, but that didn't work
either. 

It seems to me I'm going to have to modify more than one makefile for
each of the builds.  Is there any way around this?  I don't mind the
work, but it's terribly hard to maintain.

When >3.95 comes out, it's much easier to leave a note saying 'for our
systems try the command "build CC=gargle FOO=megaplex WHAT=ever sun"'
than it is to mention where and how to edit makefiles.

Whenever I post a msg through Pine 3.95 to a newsgroup or to a listserv,
instead of my name appearing in the left column, I'm seeing a statement
that starts with "To: xxxxx."  Can anyone explain this?

I decided to try the "vacation" program to see if it's installed here and 
guess what?  Here's the message I received:

UX: vacation: INFO: vacation notification installed
UX: vacation: INFO: logging will go to '/home/lindae/.maillog'
UX: vacation: INFO: '/usr/share/lib/mail/std_vac_msg' will be used for the
		     connect message

OK, gurus, how do I get out of this one?  And how can I change the
standard vacation message when I am ready to use the program?

Recently, I got my own domain name and my E-Mail address is


                        Evangelos@Rigos.com


When I send an E-mail with a script, the correct address is going out.

When I send mail with my pine, pine is picking up the old address.

I can configure the second part to read Rigos.com.


How can I configure the first part to read Evangleos?


Thanks

Umm, that's either a problem with your server, or some individual is mail 
bombing you.  I've been using Pine since last year, and, other than a few 
configuration problems that were corrected, it has ran flawlessly.

Geez!  Aren't we in a bad mood!  Next time, try to remedy this problem 
with your ISP or system admin. before making childish posts like you have 
done.  If you're not absolutely sure what the problem is, it's a good 
idea to check locally (that is, with your admin.) first.  I'm judging 
that you didn't do this, or you wouldn't have made this post in the first 
place.

Precisely what you should have done before complaining with foul language 
to this newsgroup!!

How can you make yourself clear to us when you're not 100% sure why 
you're having your problems?!  Sheese!

Who are you talking about???  Most people on comp.mail.pine are totally 
confused about this.

Oh boy.  That's a good way to spend a portion of your life:  tell those 
users a problem YOU are not even sure about.  Go ahead.  Spread the 
confusion.


> once again...just stop it.  a reply is not necessary, just stop it.

Again, what the hell are you talking about?????  Get your facts straight, 
then we will have a better chance of helping you.  Obviously, you don't 
want that at the moment.  Judging by your name, I take it you're female.  
Just to be blunt since you were in your post, is it that time of the month?

i recently ftp'd pine3.95.tar.gz from ftp.cac.washington.edu
and attempted to compile it for isc (interactive unix).

i ran into the following problem:

in the pine directory, in the makefile.isc, there is a reference to 
osdep/iscextra, however this file does not exist in the tar of 3.95 or 3.94.

Can you please help? The program appears to really need this to compile :)

thank you very much

We've run into a situation in regards to printing mail messages.  They 
print fine, but they're going to the wrong printer.  We'd like for Pine 
to print to the line printer (when using "lp" from Unix), but it goes to 
our laser printer instead.  I'll tell you how our system is configured.

Users get to their accounts by using telnet from Windows and Macs.  When 
they press "Y" to print, Pine asks them if they want to print using 
"attached-to-ansi".  When they say Yes, Pine apparently sends a command 
over the telnet connection to tell the PC or the Mac to print, which 
sends the message to the laser printer.  We rather have the messages 
print to the line dot-matrix printer, which is what we thought Pine would do.
The only way around this is to export the message from Pine, then use 
"lp" to use the line printer.

Isn't there a way to change the printing location for Pine 3.93?  I went 
into Setup/Config and didn't see an option to change the location.  Does 
this have to be configured on the PCs and Macs?  Any information would 
be deeply appreciated.  Thanks for reading.

I can't tell you how much I'd love to give up trying to figure out all
these damn control-this-and-that commands. I mean control-f to move right? Come on!, I thought this was to move down a full screen! Control-b to move left.

Give me a break, I'm tired of learning non-portable editing commands for
every unix client I want to use. 

Give us Vi!

Message-Id: <51mhu1$meg@news.doit.wisc.edu>


We are running Innosoft's Pine under OpenVMS.  One of our users can't
send any messages using Pine.  It is working OK for all other users and I
can't find anything wrong.

When he enters control-X to send a message that he composes, then the screen
just freezes and no message is sent.  If he enters control-C at this point,
then he is booted out of Pine and back to an OpenVMS prompt.

Any ideas as to what is wrong?  Thanks, in advance, for your comments.

If you could please help or tell me who to talk to.

I cannot get my HP Deskjet 660Cse printer to communicate with Pine.  It is
hook up to LPT1 and that seems to function as "name", but none of the
"command" instructions I have tried work.

: Hello all,

: When I want to post a message to a newsgroup I use my personal name

This is actually only within pine.  Your actual message shows up with
"butterfly."  What you are seeing is a new feature allowing you to
easily identify messages you have sent.  The idea is that you want to
know where you sent your messages.

try

"|command"

as a .forward file. Command should better be the full path of the
command/program/script you want to execute. Now you need some script
that extracts the information from the incoming mail and accesses the
site via a http connection, freeding it with the relevant information in
a format it expects.

You could also just telnet in to your work
host and run pine on the host.  Ask your
sys admins what host to telnet into and
to recommend a good telnet client for
your system.  I'm assuming that you have a
PPP connection - is that true?

Good luck,

I'm talking about these, not the composer's editor. If I had do use Pico
for every aspect of Pine, I wouldn't be using it at all.

Hi! Some information.....I'm trying to put the automatic signature using 
pine. The signature appears on the top of my email message and when I 
uses the function "reply" it usually happens that I have the signature on 
top and the letter is on the bottom.

QUESTION: when I reply a message, how can I do to have my signature at 
the bottom of the old letter??

Thanks to everybody for reading.

Enrico

Anyone out there ever find any useful software that will allow for
multiple mailboxes on one ISP address, that will sort and deliver the
mail on an Intra-net (MS, Novell, etc) to the various users mailboxes
and allow for their replies via one "server" connection to the
internet.

We have been looking for software that will allow us to have only one
ISP address but have multiple users within our company that access the
net regularly to send or receive e-mail. The problem that we have
found is that whoever gets the mail first, presently gets all the mail
for all users in the company bvecause we only have one ISP address.

We found a program called Cmail pput out by a coimpany in the UK but
have nothing but trouble getting it set up.  Is there any other
programs ou there like Cmail and if so, where are they?

Please e-mail all replies to this article to:

All seems to be working ok now. Instead of Ctrl-space it seems to like
the Control-shift _ (underline) to invoke the editor. It is neat
in that I find that while using Pico I can copy text from another
window (either xwindow on the Sun or some editor window on a Pentium)
into a message, whereas this is not possible using emacs. I can then
use emacs, which I am more familiar with, to do the actual editing.

I tried but did not like using the implicitly option for this reason.

This problem sounds like a lockd failure on an NFS mounted filesystem. 
Would that be possible?  If so, check the health of rpc.lockd on the
server...

If "kill -9" won't kill it, then it's not a Pine bug, it's an operating
system bug which Pine is inadvertantly tickling (we don't try to tickle OS
bugs!!!).  I'm not terribly surprised that Solaris has other OS bugs, if
it has a bug that hangs the whole system because a user program does a
zero-byte read().

I'll leave it up to your own judgement whether you really want to run an
OS that has that kind of egregious bugs.  We don't run Solaris much around
here, and so I'm making an educated guess here.

By any chance, are any of these mail files accessed via NFS?  If so, you
may be bit by a well-known bug with the fcntl() locking call; when locking
over NFS, it invokes a pair of daemons called statd and lockd that are
very fragile.

Supposedly, the code in 3.95 disables fcntl() locking if NFS is involved,
but Solaris 2.5 may have cleverly broken the test that it used for NFS.

I get a lot of Chinese mail.  From time to time, I get messages

    Unfortunately, I am not sure just what you mean by "process a Mime
attachment."  Do you mean when you try to make an attachment to a piece
of outgoing mail, or when you receive something that is coming in that
already has an attachment?  I have heard the term 'metamail', but I
know nothing about it, so I cannot give you help there.  Perhaps
someone else on the newsgroup will know.

    Also, as a rule of thumb, when you request help with a failure, you
need to provide as much diagnostic information as you can (better too
much than not enough).  Many people ask, "My car's making a funny
noise.  How do I fix it?"  Probably not the best mechanic in the world
can answer an open-ended question like that.  What version of Pine are
you running?  On what version of what operating system?  How are things
configured?  What is the *exact* error message?  At precisely what
point in the process does the error message occur?  The more
information you provide, the more likely it is that somebody,
somewhere, will be able to help.

	metamail was written by one of the authors, Nathaniel Borenstein,
of the original MIME RFC.  It contains a groups of utilities which
assist in the composition and rendering of MIME messages.

	Chances are that Douglas has in his home directory a file
called .mailcap.  This file, which pine accesses, will instrust clients
(like pine) how to render specific MIME types.

	So, if you'd want to use metamail to render the message
then you need to install metamail on your system.

Is there any chance that the next version of Pine will allow me to use vi
commands when editing headers and other things within Pine? I like Pine a
lot, but I hate Pico and hate having to learn a lot of new and awkward
commands just to edit my address-book and headers and so on. I know the two
are closely related, but couldn't they take into consideration those who
prefer other editors?

Just wonderin'

Pine web page starts at:

	 http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/pine/

that should be sufficient for you.

No, you do not need to install Pine system-wide.  Any user can do his/
her own, as long as you have enough disk space, plus your platform is
covered, or you have c compiler.  On SGI, Pine 3.95 takes about 500k 
disk space.

Cheers!

I created a list in addressbook, but every time I use it it shows all the 
addresses on the list so the receiver has to scroll through the other 
names to get to the body of the message. Is there a way to hide that?

	You are using pine 3.91.  Upgrade to 3.95, go to the rich
headers, use LCC.

> Has anybody successfully ported Pine 3.95 to Linux ?

Yes and no! When i was using a Slackware based system it compiled out of 
the box with gcc-2.6.3. But after having switched to Debian-1.1.6 since 
almost two weeks i can't compile it no more. But this is due to the fact 
that Pine relies on termcap which is not supported by Debian no more. The
Debian source package of Pine-3.94 is modified to use ncurses instead and
compiles just fine. Being no programmer i don't feel capable of changing
the original Pine-3.95 sources to compile properly in the Debian Linux 
environment. Hopefully some kind soul will supply us with a Pine-3.95.deb
package some time. I'll be using Pine-3.94 in the meantime...

Well, you are not very informative here. What Linux are you using? What kind
of distribution, which kernel version and which compiler version?

I had some inconsistencies in the behaviour of Pine-3.94 which were 
resolved by upgrading to the 3.95 release. This was supposed to be a 
bugfix for 3.94!

Yes, yes, yes, this would be great!  I'm always typing jjj to try
to move up into the headers and then dd to try to delete a line.

I use 3.91 on this account, but the version in questions is the one my 
other account.  That version is 3.93, and I don't see a Printer option.
When I press 'S' from the main menu, all I see at the bottom are the 
following:

Help              Newpassword         Update
Cancel            Config              Signature

That's all I see.  Option 'Printer' does not appear.

My guess -- and that's all it is -- is that it has nothing to do with
pine, but is part of the printer configuration -- either yours, or the
general configuration file.  Ask your local network sysadmin.

Hello! I don't have sent-mail folder in my Pine. I must have deleted it or
can I still find it somewhere? I'd like to have it but I don't find it in
my folders. It should be there, right? Could a new one be created?

I would like to know if there is a way to delete newsgroup entries in
bulk.

That is, currently each entry must be marked with a D and then X to
exclude it.  With 1,000's of entries, this can be quite time consuming.

I want to know if entries can be deleted by the date of entry, etc, and if
so, HOW?

Any help is appreciated, as I have read the help screens and found nothing
pertaining to this.

Thanks in advance.

I am using PC-Pine 3.95 and he is using Eudora (1.5 ?).  Is there a way I
can convert my pine folders so that Eudora will read them ?

I just noticed (the hard way) that if you accidentally hold down the "y" 
key in various places in the pine program you can end up with many, many
copies of a particular e-mail message being dumped to the printer. Having
the same key used to trigger printing as to answer yes to the ensuing
"Print to ...?" check seems to defeat the purpose of having a check in the
first place. If there is a user interface redesign, may I suggest that you
consider reserving the "y" key for answering yes to the various "Are you
sure?"  questions, and find some other key for printing?

I upgraded to pine 3.95 and now instead of the status message saying
"folder "INBOX" opened with N messages," it now says "sorting "INBOX"
100%."  This is extremely minor but I was wondering if this was
deliberate.  I am using the pre-compiled binary for Solaris.

Certainly, although pine doesn't have special support for it, like
many other newsreaders do. (I use trn, which does.)

There are two kinds of cancels, an ordinary cancel which removes your
message, and a supersede which replaces it with a new message.

This explains how to customize the "Reply-to:" header. Would it also

scope of a mail client?

The reason that I am asking is this: At our site we have
platform-independent addresses on our business cards
(Firstname.Lastname@Domain), but the From: header that Pine inserts
looks more like "Firstname Lastname" <Userid@Host.Domain>, which has
caused people to ask me which address to really use when responding.

Sir,
I am Unix pine user. If I am using attachment option for sending my any of
ASCII file, then pine is converting it to Mime format, so receipent is
unable to get my orginal file. And if I am using insert option to sent the
same file, the receipent is getting the orginal file, I am sending the
same file to you with both options.

kindly reply me with the solution.
  
Thanks and Regards.

    That  day  I  got your phone after long back, actually  I  was
    expacting  your call on 11th but any way you was not well that
    day.Now you tell me about Sonu.  She got a major opration or a
    minor  opration and now what is the satuation, she is  feeling
    well, we hope for early recovery for the same.

    Now  you  tell me about that day (25th jan).  I am  sorry  for
    that  day.But  for  future  I will keep this  thing  in  mind.
    Actually  I was having wrong confidence about myself and  your
    parents.   Basically they were thinking the same for all,  Any
    way we can,t change them.

Dagur.

Greetings!

I am writing in hopes you can help me out with a biggie...or not.
I have been searching the net hi and lo looking for this information. 
Recently my computer was slapped by a lightening induced blackout and I 
lost several files. I did not realize a file for mIRC was missing until I 
tried to use mIRC two days ago.  I get an error message...(cannot find 
ftpcfg.dll). Can you possibly help me to find this library? I am 
assuming it goes in the system files for windows. Is my computer 
ignorance showing yet??

I would truly appreciate any help you may offer...I am at a loss as I 
don't even know what this file is.

Thank you in advance,

Terry Sizemore-Rahn

Ian,
In retrospect, it's clear that using "y" for printing (or anything other
than "yes") was a mistake.  (I remember the fateful day well... it 
"seemed like a good idea at the time".) 

Alas, with so many millions of Pine users now, it is *very* difficult to 
change key-bindings any more.  All I can say is that I'm a lot unhappier
about "y" than you are :(

Message-Id: <52665q$gj6@solaris.cc.vt.edu>

I'm experiencing a intermittent hang when sending mail.  Occasionally, 
When I send mail (from the Unix client on a NeXTstep 3.0 system), I
hang at the message Sending 100% for several minutes.  After that time,
pine returns to the index as expected.  I get the impression that it
is a file locking bug.  Is this a known problem or has someone else
solved it?  Thanks...

Would you care to tell us which versions of UNIX you are comfortable do not
have some serious bugs?

At least Sun publishes bug fixes.  You are allowing your anti-Sun
anti-Solaris bias to show here.  Whether or not you like Sun or Solaris, if
you want to offer your software to the world, you need to be aware that Sun
Solaris THE dominent commercial UNIX.  If you do not recommend that it be
run on Solaris, you need to be clear about that.

I am not a network expert, but in the past you have failed to take account
of some of the special features of the Solaris environment (old header
include kluges ~pine 3.91).  With Solaris 2.5, Sun has wisely or unwisely
gone back to including support for some older BSD interfaces (I think they
should have left them out).  Could any of those be fooling the tests you are
making for fcntl()?

It might be helpful if the original poster has access to a Solaris 2.4
machine to config and compile pine on that and see if the binary gives the
same problems as his Sol  2.5 binary.

  When you're in Pine, go to Main Menu --> Setup --> Configurations, and
check the box beside the item `Signature-at-bottom'.
  Hope this helps.

I do a similar thing using procmail to do my filtering.  To check for
incoming mail I use a program that comes with elm (can I say that in
comp.mail.pine? :) called newmail, with which you can specify a number of 
different folders and intervals to check, etc...  You should be able to find
elm in many places via archie.

Subject: Windows95 IP Stack and Imap
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello


We have recently switched to an IMAP server on one of our UNIX machines.
Which is accessed by mulitple platforms -- UNIX, VAX, Win3, Win95,
WinNT, and MAC. The new server works fine erverywhere except for on the
WIn95 and WinNT machines. With those Operating Systems everytime you
mail a message or list a folder, you receive the error [IMAP Connection
Broken-No Server Response]. 

We have done the following to diagnos the problem:

	We installed Pine 3.92 on both Win3 and Win95 boxes. Everything worked
on the Win3 machines but not on the Windows 95 ones.

	We installed Sun Soltice Mail Client on both Win3 and Win95 boxes with
the same results.

	We snooped the traffic between the client and server of various
Pine sessions.

Note: We were able to install the 32 bit applications on the Windows 3.1
machines because we have Win32apps installed. We are using the Novell
Workplace IP stack on our Win3 machines and the MS TCPIP stack on the
Windows 95 ones.

These results lead us to believe that there was a problem with the MS 
TCPIP stack. 

We are trying to use a DNS name alias to our IMAP server --namely
imap.uncg.edu. It looks as though the IP stack is incorrectly caching
the information associated with the alias. 

When a user first starts pine, the client machine sends a querry to the
UNIX name server to get the authoritative name and IP number of the IMAP
server at login. The login succeeds, but when a user tries to list
folders, the client machine fails to recognize that it is already
connected to the imap server and logs in a second time. After the
folders are listed, the client machine logs out and the broken
connection server error is recieved. 

When we use the authoritative name of the UNIX machine in place of the
alias, everything works fine.

In case there was a problem with the DHCP server we defined the Windows
95 machine's ip address locally and used the c:\windows\hosts file to
point
to the imap servers without result.

Additionally in order to test things out, we tried to connect the
Windows95 machine  to an imap server on a VMS machine and everything
worked. 

We called Microsoft Technical support and were told the Microsoft does
not support TCPIP connections to UNIX machines and thus they were unable
to help us. They said that there is some patch that we can put on our
UNIX machine to get in to work though. Does anyone know of any solutions 
or what that patch might be.

Our IMAP server is running Solaris v2.5 and is patched to current. revs.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Rachel

	Do you mean not knowing enough to read the help menus??  :-) :-)

BOUNCE
 
The bounce (B) command allows you to re-send, or "remail", a
message, as if you were never in the loop.  It is analogous to crossing
out your address on a postal letter, writing a different address on the
envelope, and putting it into the mailbox. Bounce is used primarily to
redirect email which was sent to you in error.  Also, some owners of email
lists need the bounce command to handle list traffic.
 
The presence or absence of the Bounce command is determined by the
"enable-bounce-cmd" feature-list option in your Pine configuration. Note
that Bounce may be administratively disabled by your system manager; if it
doesn't work, please check with your local help desk before reporting a
bug.

	Directly from the help......

Someone suggested that I delete the file in my home directory called
.forward in order to reverse the auto-generated vacation msg.  I tried
this and received the message that the file doesn't exist.

I've contacted the sysadmin at my ISP but he claimed that he didn't even
know the program existed!  <groan>

Any other suggestions?

Reposting article removed by rogue canceller.

Hi! Some information.....I'm trying to put the automatic signature using 
pine. The signature appears on the top of my email message and when I 
uses the function "reply" it usually happens that I have the signature on 
top and the letter is on the bottom.

QUESTION: when I reply a message, how can I do to have my signature at 
the bottom of the old letter??

Thanks to everybody for reading.

Enrico

If you are using Pine 3.95 the last step should be changed
so that instead of `! N' you arrow down to the New field and
then type `X X' to unset that flag.

Subject: how to avoid bogus X-Sender header?
Date: 24 Sep 1996 12:11:34 GMT
Message-Id: <528j5m$94e@janitor.focus.dbag.bln.DaimlerBenz.com>

Hi,

I recently tried to build pine 3.95 (first on Solaris 2.5) because elm gave 
me so much trouble. It compiled out of the box (something I never seen
with elm) but there is one annoying problem:

I compiled with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and DF_USE_ONLY_DOMAIN_NAME, then 
set the domain in the config file because pine itself couldn't figure
it out. Now every mail composed with pine gets a completely bogus 
X-Sender header which only contains username@hostname (without domain).

I did not find any setting to switch this very annoying behaviour off 
(I do not mind to set ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM to off, as long as there is
a way to specify the domainname somewhere at compile time) - is there a 
way to do this without fiddling with the source on every platform I compile
it? Unfortunately I didn't find anything in tech-notes or the pine 
information center. Any clue appreciated.

TIA
schmadde

Look in your /etc/hosts file to make sure that the complete form of host
name is listed *before* the short form.

Hi everybody,
	I'm hoping someone could help me out. Lately, I'd changed my 
read/write permissions to my account and from then on for some 
strange(and possibly unrelated reason)  reason, I'm not able to recieve 
any messages in my PINE Inbox although I know that I'm getting new 
messages everyday(which I check on Netscape). I tried playing around with 
 the Configuration within PINe but to no avail. Hope some of you can 
help,
	Thanks,

Is there any way to disable Pine's startup networking (which eventually

Does anybody know how to get PINE to run as a dos window?  I am trying to
set up a mail server where people can telnet in and check mail, but on a
Windows NT 3.51 server.  If not does anybody know of another  
full-featured text mail/POP client for NT?

Thanks

Joel Kislan

It worked fine for me...  Of course, this is assuming you have enough
quota to compile the sucker.  Pine itself doesn't need to do anything as
root.

Yes, there is.  In the Pine set-up, make sure that you have the
"enable-aggregate-command-set" and "enable-flag-cmd" options checked.  Go to
your folder index and do "; a" to select all messages, then use "a * ! n" to
flag all selected messages as "not new."  A final "; a" will unselect all
messages.

Bounce is not the same as BCC.  To see the Blind Carbon Copy header, use CTRL-R
while in the header section of the message you're composing to reveal the "rich
headers."  If you use it a lot, modify your setup option "default-composer-hdrs"
to make BCC appear automatically for each message you send.

If you don't want to use the Pico editor anymore you'll have to enable the

I dunno why the attachment shouldn't arrive, but if you want to convert the WP51
file to a straight text file, I'd suggest the following steps:

1. In WP, set your margins/font so the lines wrap before the edge of the screen.
2. Use CTRL-F5, T, S to save the text as a straight text file.

Then you can use Pine's CTRL-R command to read the file directly into the
message you're composing.

After selecting the message(s) you want, you can operate on them as a group
using the "a" (for "apply") command.  This allows you to "apply" the commands
"save," "export," "delete" and a variety of others to your selected messages.

I have pine setup on 4 of our servers, one of which is our main mail host.
Using MAPI to connect to main host. All works fine on the mail host. On
the other servers however, the message-ID is broken... it's always

	Message-ID: -100000

Anyone have this problem b4?

Absolutely. First, you need to have the enable-aggregate-command
option set in Setup/Config.

Then, you can select messages using the ; command, and delete the
selected messages with A(pply) D(elete).

To select according to date received, find the first and last message
you want to delete (say, from 1 to 850) and do a select by number:

;n1-850

Sending date requires you to do a sort by date first:

$d
;n1-850

If you use a different default sort order than Arrival in your folders,
you need to resort for the first case as well.

Selecting by text content and other things in messages is also possible:
follow the ; sub-menus.

Note that the select (;) command behaves slightly different if you
already have something selected.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

OK, I get two asterisks, so it is saving the state of the mailbox.  How
do I make it stop doing this every few minutes or so?  It is really
annoying since it will buffer keystrokes for the 10-30 seconds or more it
takes, so I may inadvertently delete messages or worse.

	If you were using pine 3.95 you could go to setup/config and
find the following "feature":

mail-check-interval      = <No Value Set: using "150">   

	You might even read the help menu and find:

        OPTION: Mail-Check-Interval
 
This options specifies, in seconds, how often Pine will check for new
mail.  If set to zero, new-mail checking is disabled.  There is a minimum
value, normally 15 seconds.

	SUPRIZE!!!!  Your header information shows.....

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.960924164958.4836B-100000@deimos.ceddec.com>

	So, guess what.....that feature is available to you!  You
just failed to do "information research".

	Regards,

		Ed

Jaclyn,
	What that usually means is that something else is trying to access
your inbox at the same time you are there.  That means someone else has
access to your acount, or you have Netscape open at the same time and it
is trying to check if you have mail.  This can go away easily, by quitting
Pine and re-entering again, you may have to do that everytime you get
that message, though.

Good Luck,
	James

I have a question.  Is it possible to change the "From" on Pine?  While 
'surfing the net' I wrote letters to a few sites, and I was able to 
choose what name i would go under, and  I was given the option of 
allowing the person who was to recieve my message of keeping my e-mail 
adress confidential. Is 
there anyway to perform this command on Pine? I appreciate your help.

I'm reading a msg in a newsgroup.  I wish to download it using Zmodem.
Is there a way to pipe it into rz/sz?

(I currently have to save it into a file, exit PINE, download it, re-enter
PINE.  Of course I lose my place where I was last reading.)

"Can't send message without an open remote folder"


How can I get rid of this error message which pops up whenever I try to
compose offline?  I have PC-Pine 3.95 running on DOS, and set up Pine to
use a file (which I manually update) on my PC as the inbox.

I have a DOS version of PICO which came with the PC-Pine package I
downloaded.  Is there a way to change the noxious blue, cyan, and orange 
colors which PICO came in?  (I was able to change it in Pine.)

Message-Id: <529t0j$o7a@net161-61.student.yale.edu>

  Some mail/news  programs including Pine(with an appropriate entry in
mailcap)  can be configured to launch a web browser to display
text/html. My ~/.mailcap contains following line, which works
with most mail client/news reader endorsing mailcap(e.g. Pine, Tin,Elm)

text/html; xterm -e lynxpipe %s

where lynxpipe is a shell script shown below.

--------------
#!/bin/sh
trap 'rm -f /tmp/$$.*; exit 1' 1 2 15
IN=$1
test  $IN || { IN=/tmp/$$.stdin ;cat >$IN; }
cp $IN $IN.html
lynx  $IN.html
/bin/rm /tmp/$IN.html
/bin/rm /tmp/$$*
-------------

  Netscape-Mail is also able to display text/html in mail message 
as it should be the case because it's a web browser. 

  Problem with Pine is that there's no way to attach HTML file
with Content-Type header text/html. Pine blindly put 'text/plain'
in "Content-Type: " whether it's html or really plain text.
I suspect it also puts 'text/plain' instead of even if it's a 
Postscript file. To solve this problem, I suggest a couple of options
be added to Pine configuration.  They are 

'Allow manual Content-Type designation when attaching' 
  and/or 
'Automatically determine Content-Type for attachment based on extension'.

  I guess what they are meant to be is obvious. Besides,
there can be a case when attached text file(text/plain, text/html)
uses character set different from other part of message as specified
in 'charset' of Pine configuration. Hence, it'd be nice to have
Pine ask for charset field when attaching 'text/*' file.

  I wish this would be cosnidered carefully and reflected in
next release of Pine.

I've searched around for a copy of the 3.95 manual but can't seem to
locate it anywhere on the system.  I thought it was under Setup, Update
but no luck.  Am I looking in the wrong place?

  When you're composing a message, move the cursor to one of the header
lines and press ^R. This keystroke enables Rich Headers, which include the
field Bcc:.
  Hope this helps.

Hi,
my name is Paolo Mattioli and I would like to know if Pine (Unix -

using sendmail. In other words I would like to delete sendmail
program, cause of security, and to receive e-mail messages from a POP3
server.

                                        Thanks for your suggestions,

Most people at our site are using PC clients such as Eudora, which are

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

TIA for any assistance that can be provided.  Not a big problem, but
annoying and makes me feel and look like the newbie that I am.

Because I like Pine and learned how to do e-mail initially with Pine, I
also use it for news groups.  This situation began with version 3.94 and
continues into version 3.95.  I think it is a configuration situation, but
my system admin says it is a "feature" that is built into Pine.

When I post to a newsgroup, in the index of the newsgroup, instead of
showing my name, the line "To:" appears.  How can I correct this?

I have read the faq, read everything that seems relevant in the Pine
homepage, but I can't figure it out.

Again, thanks for any help.

	There is *nothing* to correct.  This question pops up many
times a week.  It leads one to wonder if anyone actually reads the
replies, etc.....  

	Anyway, if you go to the I(ndex) screen and type ?(help) you
can read a bit and find...

  SENDER: The name or email address of the sender.  If you are the sender,
then the first recipient's name is shown here.  In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed. 
 
	So, it is a feature.....   *Your* pineine knows who you
are....you know who you are (we hope.... ).  So, why display that a
message was sent by you when you know your sent it???

	*MY* pine doesn't know who you are.....so *MY* pine displays
your name.

	OK???

You can do:
  1) Save the mesg to a file, and edit the header. Print the edited file.
  2) Use a tailored print cmd, which does eleminating unwanted headers.

This works for attached files with .html as suffix (pine 3.95 at linux).

I had done this.  Reading the help file does not explain why we do not see
our name in the index file nor is the change mentioned in any of the
update files.  Perhaps you have extraordinary abilities that I don't and
therefore you assume the righteousness to insult me and others.  FWIW, I

the change?

Because I expect, and would much prefer, that it display in the same
manner that the other messages are displayed

It is ok that it displays properly for you, but it is not ok that it

Ummm... agreed that the built-in help doesn't explain the "Why?" of this
feature, but you must admit that it does say "What" is done.

As for why it doesn't explain the "Why?"... well I guess they didn't feel
the need; many, many pieces of documentation explain the "what" but rarely
the "why".

Perhaps the Pine Team could consider including a bit of "why" about this
feature in the built-in help given how many times the question gets asked.

> Perhaps you have extraordinary abilities that I don't and
> therefore you assume the righteousness to insult me and others.

Hmmm... I don't think they feel they have extraordinary abilities.
Perhaps, like myself at times, they are just fed up with having this
question asked and answered half a dozen times or so each week.

Are you (jbenny) new to this mailing list/newsgroup?  If so then there is
perhaps reason for you to ask your question (although Netiquette suggests
reading past articles and "lurking" for a while before starting to post
your own).  If you have been reading the group for a while then I'm
surprised you haven't noticed how often this question goes by :-}

> FWIW, I
> think it was a stupid change.

It depends what you mean by "change" here... Pine has always -- as far as
I recall -- behaved in this way.

Sorry to disagree with you but Pine 3.91 certainly behaves in this way (I
have just checked) and, if memory serves, versions all the way back to
3.87 (the version at which I think I first encountered Pine) did likewise.

Perhaps you've only just started using Usenet News or saving outgoing
messages and so have just noticed the effect?

> Because I expect, and would much prefer, that it display in the same

OK... the current version of Pine (3.95) allows you to change this.  (Note
that this is new to 3.95 -- or possibly slightly earlier; it was
definitely missing in 3.91)

At the Main Menu type "S" (Setup) then "C" (Configuration) and look
through the options for "index-format".  Put your cursor on this entry and
type "?" to read the built-in help about it.

Assuming you are otherwise happy with the layout of the Index screen you
can change things to as you want them by noting the default value used:

    index-format=STATUS MSGNO DATE FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)

and setting a value based very closely on this:

    index-format=STATUS MSGNO DATE FROM(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)

(Note the change of FROMORTO to become FROM.)

So far from the Pine Team introducing a change which you hate, the only
change the've actually made is to let you _avoid_ the display you despise
so much :-)

Cheers,

Hello,
I've two problems/questions which I guess to be easy.
1) Is there a version of Pine for Mac OS 7.x ?
2) I've just installed pc-pine on a PC running win95, and with an
ethernet card (I'm using the resident TCP/IP stack given iwth win95). I
would like to read my mail on a Unix machine connected to this PC. But I
can't access to my MBOX! Is there someone who could tell me what I
should install on my snmtp (unix) server to read my mails on my PC ?
note: I well specified in the pine configuration the name of the snmtp
server !

Thanks a lot in advance !
Thierry

	No need to be sorry.  Just follow proper netiquette, which is
to read the past few weeks of messages before posting.  In the past
10 days this same question has been asked/answered 5X.

	No desire to "insult" but I'm not sure how clearer the extraction
from the help menu could be?  It states: "If you are the sender, then the
first recipient's name is shown here".  That's what you are seeing....
right?

	The "change" only affects the I(ndex) screen.  If you type
v(iew) you will see what everyone in the rest of the world sees.

	One reason is that you can get many messages that start out
like this:

Subject: Re: Bug in pine 3.95

	(Well.....hopefully not too many with that subject :-) )

	If I've a visual indication that I've sent this message...I
can skip over it.

	Oh, well.  Suspect you can't please all of the people all of

  Of course, it should work although I don't wanna invoke netscape to
display attached HTML. My solution, invoking much lighter lynx instead,
is preferrable to me. Anyway, that's NOT an issue,here. My posting is
NOT about viewing attached HTML file but about attaching HTML file(and
other file in plain text format but not text/plain. e.g. Postscript)  in
Pine. Pine should put 'text/html' in Content-Type header when a file one
wanna attach is 'html' file.  One easy way is determine MIME subtype by
file extension and the other is let users specify MIME type manually.

No.  However there are some alternatives (which make better use of the Mac
interface).  You may like to try out:

*  Mail Drop (free)
   See <URL:ftp://ackmo.baylor.edu/pub/bell/Mail_Drop/>
   (Get the latest development (d) or beta (b) version.)

*  Mulberry (commercial)
   See <URL:http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/cydasoft/Mulberry/Info.html>
   (Demo version available.)

A list of other IMAP clients (Mac and other platforms) can be found at The
IMAP Connection:

[Please be careful when using acronyms: SNMP is a network management
protocol; SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol!]

In order to use PC-Pine to read mail from a UNIX machine that UNIX machine
must have an IMAP server installed and properly configured.  You then set
up PC-Pine to open an IMAP connection to this server to give access to
your mail folders.

In the first instance check whether an IMAP server has been set up on your
UNIX system.  If not, then that is the first step.  If there is one there
(and it is known to work) then there is a problem with your PC-Pine
configuration (which no-one can help with unless you descibe how it is
currently configured, the name of your IMAP server, etc.)

Cheers,

There isn't a separate set of sources just for PC-Pine.  Instead the usual
Pine sources are used (they can be compiled for a nummber of UNIX
platforms plus Windows etc).

You can find the current (3.95) sources at:

    <ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu//pine/pine3.95.tar.gz>
    <ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu//pine/pine3.95.tar.Z>

The former is compressed using gzip, the latter compress (so make sure you
transfer them in binary mode in order to uncompress them successfully).

The latest version is always pointed to by:

    <ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu//pine/pine.tar.gz>
    <ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu//pine/pine.tar.Z>

    For starters, comp.mail.pine is not an email address.  It is the
name of a newsgroup.  I am not being picky -- there really is a
difference, both practically and technically.  If this were an email
address and you weren't able to send email, we could not have seen your
message, could we?  :-)

    As for your problem, we cannot help you until you provide more
information.  Just telling an auto mechanic, "My car's making a funny
noise" is insufficient data for him to be able to do very much about
fixing your car.

    The more information you can provide, the more likely it is that
someone will be able to help you.  Does your site have a help desk or
user information center?  If so, that is the first place to ask for
help.  Otherwise, diagnostic information is necessary.

    From your message header, it appears that you are using Pine
version 3.95, although it is always nice to have that confirmed.  (That
information is very important.)  I do not recognize an apparent system
designator of "GSO."  What operating system are you using?  What
version?  What kind of hardware?  What mail transfer agent is involved? 
(Sendmail?  Some other?  What version?)  Most importantly of all, when
you try to send mail, *exactly* what happens?  What kind of error
message pops up?  How do you know and why do you say that you cannot
send mail?

    I hope you won't take offense, but just saying, "It's broken. 
What's wrong?" just isn't enough information for people to be able to
help you.

The "character-set=" option marks outgoing e-mail with the appropriate header.
(If pine finds that the outgoing message contains nothing but 7-bit characters,
it will be marked US-ASCII regardless of how this variable is set.) 

The gentleman needs to describe what type of terminal he is using. The
terminal itself must be capable of displaying the character set used by
the incoming message. pine only passes the message along as-is.

I did.  But I set it to 65535, and 30000 and other numbers.
It seems to work better at 3600, but it says "mail-check" and not
folder checkpointing.  I assume this controls both?

	No, it does not control checkpointing.  Only mail-check can
be set via the config.  For checkpointing you need to modify the
os-XXX.h file and recompile.  An excerpt fromt the os-sol.h file
shows:

#define CHECK_POINT_TIME (7*60) /* Check point the mail file (write changes
                                   to disk) if more than CHECK_POINT_TIME
                                   seconds have passed since the first
                                   change was made.  Depending on what is
                                   happening, we may wait up to three times
                                   this long, since we don't want to do the
                                   slow check pointing and irritate the user. */
 
#define CHECK_POINT_FREQ   (12) /* Check point the mail file if there have been
                                   at least this many (status) changes to the
                                   current mail file.  We may wait longer if
                                   it isn't a good time to do the checkpoint. */

	Hope this is of some value....

I am having troubls with my configuration setup.  I seem to somehow have 
lost my folders and can't find them.  I asked my local administrator but 
they didn't know what to do.  So then I reported the bug to pine and they 
advised me to contact you.  Pleaswe help me as soon as possible I need to 
use my email to its fullest capacity.  Thank you.

: Hello all,
:  
: When I want to post a message to a newsgroup I use my personal name
: which is butterfly.  Usually (with the old version of pine), upon posting,
: what others see when they look at my message in the index is my personal
: name and the subject of the message.  This time, after posting, my
: personal name did not appear.  Instead, it said, "To: 'newsgroup name'"
: and the subject.

This is actually only within pine.  Your actual message shows up with
"butterfly."  What you are seeing is a new feature allowing you to
easily identify messages you have sent.  The idea is that you want to
know where you sent your messages.

Will someone send me those neat commands that I can have in my login file
that show how I can have it tell me "You have new mail." AND "You have
<number here> messages"?

Are there other quick commands like "from" which are handy to use.  I
ususally use from before entering pine to save some time.

Thanks,

Rasheed

If you're using Pine 3.91 and above.
Setup, Config, inbox-path, Change, change it to {server.goes.here/pop3}inbox

	What do I have to do to make Pine understand that I want the lok

I have this error every time I enter Pine and my mailbox is not empty:

[Error creating/var/spool/mail/misa.lock.843667486.10412.thor.infoiasi.ro:

I assume that I have to modify something in the sources and recompile

Please respond to misa@infoiasi.ro

No, I don't believe it does explain what is done to make the index file
look differently in the news groups index.

Well, again, it doesn't explain the "what" or the "why" as it pertains to
news groups.  It does explain the "what" in the index folders that are
personal to me, but not the news groups.

Yes, especially since this only began in version 3.94 and did not occur in
the previous version that I and others had been using.

It would also be helpful if the information appeared in the faq, which it
does not.

Then maybe it shouldn't have been changed?

No, but I have not subscribed for several months as Pine was working so
smoothly, I didn't really have a need to subscribe 'til now.

True, enough.  However, one would expect to find the answer in the faq or
somewhere at the Pine homepage site.  While there is an abundance of
wonderful information there, the situation at hand is not mentioned at
all.

In the 2 years that I have been using Pine to read newsgroups and do
e-mail, Pine has NOT behaved this way in the index of newsgroups.  It is
an unexpected behavior for me and apparently for others.

We must be talking about two different things, because this is just not
the case.  I don't know what version I started with, but it was prior to
version 3.93.  Using Pine as a news reader both at the university as well
as my commercial account,  I can assure you that in the index of the news
groups, my name appeared as did everyone else's name.  If Pine had always
appeared with a "To:" line in the newsgroup index, then no one would
question it.  If we were all new to using Pine, then we wouldn't know that
it is a change.

Yet another insult to our intelligence.  Perhaps we aren't talking about
the same things.  Do you use Pine as a news reader.  You are correct in
that Pine did appear in the index of "sent-mail" this way, but not in the
index of the news group.

I will attempt your suggested change and see what happens.  I appreciate
the valuable time you took to answer my inquiry.

I don't "hate" it, but it just looks stupid.  Yes, I know who wrote the
message, and I know where it was posted to, but I would much prefer that
the index of the newsgroup appear as it did before.

Are you sure that you read Rudolf's reply as clearly as he wished?
He gave you the solution in the information about the .mime.types file.
Or are you saying that you tried that and it didn't work?

Nathan,
Sorry; it wasn't immediately obvious that you had confused me with the
person who needed help.  (I know what my smtp server address should be,
and I wasn't the person who posted the original query, so I assumed your
intent was to suggest to the original inquirer that they should use one of
our smtp servers.)

	The original question concerning POP3 came from  Paolo Mattioli
<paolo@tecno.ior.it>.  You'll notice that Paolo is writing from Italy.
Even if  mx1.cac.washington.edu was willing to act as the SMTP host
for the world it would not be purdent for an individual in Italy to
point to a host on the west coast of the USA as their SMTP host.

	But Terry is 1000% correct.  Please don't point to
mx1.cac.washington.edu as your SMTP host *or* any other host outside of
your domain without the express written consent of the postmaster for
that site.  To do so may put a strain on that orgainization's facilities
and is certainly in bad form.  In addition, it may result in some unexpect
and undesireable results.  For example, if you supply underqualified
addresses it is standard practice for a site to tack-on their local
domain part.  So, if Paolo were to send a message to the person down
the hall as antony@tecno but pointed to ibm.com as the SMTP host then
it is more than likely that ibm.com will try to deliver to
antony@tecno.ibm.com.  See the problem?

	Regards,

Better still....use the Lcc: field.

Don't know what the Lcc: field is?  Maybe it is time to upgrade to the
latest
version of pine?  Maybe it is time to do "information research"?

  Thanks a lot for poingting this out. 

  I'm sorry I didn't know Pine refer to mime.types to determine what to
write in 'Content-Type:' header when sending out attachment and
accordingly didn't try adding 'text/html html' to ~/.mime.types.  As I
understands him, he wasn't talking about sending html attachment but
about receiving and displaying it, which is not my concern because I
know it works well(whether I use my script lynxpipe or netscape as he
suggested) even without the line("Content-Type: text/html" in header is
sufficient to convince Pine and other MIME-aware programs that it's html
file and .mime.types mechanism is not necessary). Anyway,I guess my
original suggestion still stands worthwhile to consider. That is, it
would not be a bad idea to add option 'Allow manual Content-Type
designation for attachment', which includes allowing 'charset'
specification different from primary charset designated in ~/.pinerc and
other configuration file.

  Another related issue(it's about viewing attached text/html) is the
way Pine handles external viewers that need to use the same tty(terminal
device : I don't  know the exact term to use here) currently under
control  of Pine.  Suppose there are following lines in ~/.mailcap where
lynxpipe is a script to hand over <datafile>(%s) to lynx with suffix
'html' added to the end of temporary file name.

--------
text/html; xterm -e lynxpipe %s; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"
text/html; lynxpipe %s
--------

  When $DISPLAY is defined(i.e. under X window), xterm is launched in
which lynx runs to display text/html and everything works fine while
under text-only terminal Pine doesn't release the control of
'tty'(terminal) to a external viewer and nothing happens except for that
the message 'External viewer is launched' is displayed. My understanding
is this is in a sense intentional for such reason as security.  I wonder
if there's any way to allow external viewers requiring control of the
current termial device to work gracefully without compromising
advantages of not doing so.

  I would be very grateful if Pine team could carefully 
consider my suggestions.

     Jungshik Shin

Well, the main reason I am GLAD that there is a confirm for sending 
messages is that ^X and ^C are right next to each other... many were the 
time when I hit a x when I meant c, or even more terrible, hitting c 
after typing in a half hour missive... I would have been extremely upset 
to see that letter cancelled...

I have a server that automatically marks every (more that 29 thousand) 
newsgroup as subscribed.  When using TIN to access newsgroups, I created 
a seperate file and used (prompt) tin -f .real (ret) to access it... Is 
there either a global Unsubscribe for pine, or a way to access only the 
newsgroups listed in .real?

Please send a copy of answers to address below, since I am having trouble 
with newsgroups at the moment, and may not be able to find it later... thanks

Uh oh.  I didn't see Printer in 3.93.  Are you sure it's in that version, 
or is it in 3.95?

Sure, I do that all the time, in an xterm window:

xterm -e pine &

I've put it in a menu as well, so I don't have to write it everytime. How
to do that depends on your window manager.

	When you upgraded to 3.95, did you read the release notes???

	Have you performed *any* type of "Information Research"?
Did you read the past 10 days worth of traffic on this group and notice
that the "Reply-To: " question has popped up several times?

	I gather not....since if you did you would have tripped over
"quell-dead-letter-on-cancel" in the config menu.  Had you performed
"Information Research" you would have typed "?" and read:

        FEATURE: quell-dead-letter-on-cancel
 
This feature affects Pine's behavior when you cancel a message being
composed.  Pine's usual behavior is to write the canceled message to
a file named "dead.letter" in your home directory (under UNIX;
"DEADLETR" under WINDOWS/DOS) overwriting any previous message. Under
some conditions (some routine), this can introduce a noticeable delay.
 
Setting this feature will cause Pine NOT to write canceled compositions
into the file called dead.letter.
 
NOTE: Enabling this feature means NO record of canceled messages is
maintained.


	If you were to be more information hungry you would have 
found "customized-Headers".  You would then have typed "?" and been
presented with exactly the information you so desire.....

        OPTION: Customized-Headers
 
You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.

	Wow....it even mentions the "Reply-To:" header by name.....

	Please folks....try a bit of "Information Research".  You'll
be glad you did.

	Regards,

		Ed

I agree with Ed ... except I think his last sentence should really read:
"_We'll_ be glad you did."  ;-)

(I also replied to your earlier note, but see that you're still in trouble.)

Make _definitely_ sure that there isn't a /home/lindae/.forward file
(try an "ls -a /home/lindae" to see all the files there).

Definitely try "man vacation" to get the documentation.

Insist on talking to a systems administrator who, if he or she doesn't
know that a program is present on the system, will research the
problem for you.

Failing that, find a supervisor at your ISP and complain vehemently.
It's a _very_ competetive market out there, and you should either
convince them to help you out, or change service providers.

See the manual page for "vacation" for details (that is, run the
command "man vacation".  If you don't get a documentation page for
"vacation", then scream loudly at your ISP that they must install the
Unix manual pages.  If they refuse, change ISP).

There is now probably a file ".vacation.msg" in your home directory
that you can edit as you see fit.

The actual invocation of vacation is controlled by the presence and
contents of a file ".forward" in your home directory containing a
single line, something like:

\lindae, "|/usr/ucb/vacation lindae"

If you delete or move that file (say, to "..forward"), then the
"vaction" function will cease.

I am sure my questions are not new, but I still haven't received
any answers on them. If somebody can help me, please send a response
directly to my mailbox.

We have a site with ~70 UNIX machines & ~90 PCs (NT and 95). All PCs have
NFS client. Our mail-server is UNIX computer (all mailboxes are resident
on its disk).  I want to configure Pine 3.95 to enable all users of the
site to use it. Two major problems: 

1. How can I share global address book between UNIXs and PCs. There
   is no problem for UNIXs. But how to export the same address book
   for PCs? I even accept a solution of different (not UNIX) but still
   a single one global address book for all PCs.

2. Any notification for new mail in Windows 95|NT, while pine is iconed.
   Without this I can't convince our PC users to use Pine.

Message-Id: <52c38o$b0o@bertrand.ccs.carleton.ca>



I have noticed a bug in pc-pine 3.95, when running it under Windows 3.1,
and I would like to find a solution.

This is how to reproduce the bug:

 - Edit the pinerc file, adding "disable-keymenu" to the feature-list.
 - Get into pine, select a message and select "Export" from the
   "Message" menu.
 - Select "To Files".
 - Then select "Cancel".
 - The error message is:

   " An error has occurred in your application.
     If you choose Ignore, you should save your work in a new file.
     If you choose Close, your application wil terminate."

 - Your choices are: "Close" or "Ignore"

I have the source code. If anyone has a clue about where to look in
the source code to fix this bug, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.
Jane

If, as you say, the program needs control of the terminal you should
specify the option "needsterminal" in your mailcap file. So, change your
entry for plain terminals into:

   text/html; lynxpipe %s; needsterminal

With this option is specified, Pine will close its tty drivers and give
complete control to the external viewer for the time that program runs. 
After the viewer has terminated, Pine will take back control of the tty.

Hope this helps!

Do you really mean "mbox files", or do you mean "mail.txt files"?
mail.txt is the native and natural format of MM.

Pine supports mail.txt files automatically.  However, Pine does
database-type access to mail.txt files (this is different from MM); it's
faster than MM and allows multiple instances of Pine to have the same file
open, but at the cost of not working over NFS.  Locking and simultaneous
read/write access does't work over NFS. 

So if your users' home directories are NFS-mounted, you should have them
use IMAP to the machine which actually holds the real disk.  NFS is not
really a filesystem, and should not be used to export mail.

	PLEASE ANSWER ME....	

	I`m a user of your program PINE. This is a good programm but I 
have had a bit problem with this the last days. I`m going to relate that.

	If you are in the LIST FOLDERS, you can create diferents folders, 
but if you have very diferents folders, sometimes could be necesary the 
creating of some folders whose contens was others folthers as directorys 
in a UNIX machine. I hope you can understand me, in this case I wish
you can answer me with the exact reason about why you don`t do this or if 
you are planing do this in the next version of PINE.

	Thanks very very very .... much.

I'm looking for a spell checker for PC-Pine 3.95.  I've tried the web
sites documented in the release notes but the links do not work.
Specifically, I've tried ftp://oak.oakland/SimTel/win3/wp and
http://clever.net/quinion/spell/Where.htm.  Does anyone know where I might
find this?

Thanks.

It's a reasonable question.  It means the message was specifically
addressed to you instead of to a list.

Hello,

I have a question. Can I make aliases for a group of friends
in address book? Why when I type their email addresses PINE
said comma is not allowed between two email addresses,  and
white space is also not allowed. Please tell me how to type
the email addresses.


Thank you in advance.

Hi,

We are running pine 3.95 on Solaris 2.5 and having a recurring problem.
One or more times a day, pine complains of an INBOX access error, which
can only be cleared by killing and restarting pine.  It started as we
moved our users over to CDE.  I have eliminated the AMD automounter as the
cause, and we have tried a number of kernel patches that we thought might
help.  Unfortunately, nothing seems to work.  Anyone else having this
problem, or does anyone have a solution?

Thanks,
Mitch

    I find this unusual, because I do not have any problems with
sending messages to multiple recipients on the From: by separating each
address with a commaa followed by a space.  (I am using version 3.94.)
But in answer to your question, yes, you can set up aliases for whole
groups of address and enter only the alias on the From:, Cc:, Bcc:, or
Lcc: lines of the message header.  Just go into the address book and
read the online help screens.  It's all explained there.

No it is not, and that seems to be due the Pine team's deliberate policy
regarding 8-bit. I asked the same question as you in a local Finnish
newgroup, and got an answer with the following material:

I recently installed pine v3.95 on our SunOS machine.  When I try to
modify the global addressbook, it is flagged as ReadOnly.  The setting in
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf is....

global-address-book=/usr/local/sun1/pine3.89/.addressbook

The file has the correct permissions (666).  Am I missing something?  Any
help would be greatly appreciated!

Pine offers several choices for sending mail to multiple recipients -
comma-delimited lists in to To:, Cc:, Bcc:, and Lcc: fields. When I am
sending out such a message, the mail system must, at some point, determine
who is going to receive a copy of this message. How is this done? I can
only imagine that Pine, or our local mailer daemon, create an 'envelope'
for every recipient, put a copy of my message into this envelope
(stripping off fields libe Bcc: or Lcc:), and send this to its
destination. The recipient's mailer daemon, on the other hand, opens the
envelope and puts the letter into the respective mailbox.

Am I wrong? (Just curious)

Thanks,
      -  Hans

	Not wrong......just close.

	pine is a UA (user agent).  It will call a program (quite often
sendmail) known as an (message transport agent) to perform the
transportation of the message.  

	You are correct that an envelope is formed.  There is no 
reall stripping however.  When pine builds the message it will 
not create a Bcc: header in the message headers.  However, when it
calls the MTA it will give the MTA a receipient list which includes
the Bcc: info.  The "header" and "envelope" receipients are generally
kept apart.

	Hope this helps....

pine is now at 3.95 and as the link promised......8bit is possible 
when ESMTP support is available....

An excerpt from the help menu (after doing "Information Reasearch"  :-) )
shows:

        FEATURE: enable-8bit-to-smtp-server
 
This feature affects Pine's behavior when sending mail.  Internet
standards
require that all electronic mail messages traversing the global Internet
consist of 7bit ASCII characters unless a pair of cooperating mail 
transfer agents explicitly agree to allow 8bit messages.  In general, 
then, exchanging messages in non-ASCII characters requires MIME encoding.
 
However, there are now Internet standards that allow for unencoded 8bit
exchange of messages between cooperating systems.  Setting this feature
tells Pine to try to negotiate unencoded 8bit transmission during the
sending process.  Should the negotiation fail, Pine will fall back to its
ordinary encoding rules. 
 
Note, this feature relies on your system's mail transport agent or
configured "smtp-server" having the negotiation mechanism introduced in
"Extended SMTP" (ESMTP) and the specific extension called "8BITMIME". 

Hope this helps.....

   Someone suggested that I delete the file in my home directory called

   even know the program existed!  <groan>

Hmm.  Look in /etc/sendmail.cf (possibly /usr/lib/sendmail.cf or even
elsewhere) for a line that starts with "OJ" or "O ForwardPath=" for
other locations where a .forward file might be living.  Specifically,
this line should give a colon-delimited list of pathnames for potential
.forward files.  Probably there are some abbreviations: $z for your home
directory, and $w for your hostname (unqualfied by its domain name -- no
dots).

If you find such a .forward file, I would suggest renaming it rather
than deleting it, e.g.

	mv .forward.myhost .forward.myhost.DISABLED

or at least to read and record its contents before deleting it.  That
way you'll know if it was really behind your autoresponses.

Hope this helps,

If you look closer at the headers of her message, it looks like it
passed through the pine-info=>comp.mail.pine gateway at psg.com.  Thus
she apparently did send her message via e-mail...

GSO is the port for Solaris using the GCC compiler (as opposed to the
Solaris compiler).

I've looked through the various FAQs, checked the man entries, but no
luck.  I hope someone on this list can help with what is probably an easy
problem.  

I'm setting up several new win95 systems, and have them all
configured.  The problem is when I try to run pine (through a Netscape
telnet connection), I get the error message "Your terminal, of type
'ansi', is lacking functions needed to run pine."

Now when I run pine through a winqvt terminal connection, everything works
just fine.  So what's wrong with my non-qvt configuration that is giving
this error?  

Thanks for any and all help.

Hi! Expert,

How can I send broadcasting emails? I have a list of my friends, I want 
to send the same email to all of them with one address on each mail 
header. What I mean is that there shouldn't be all the addresses in the 
header? Can pine do that? Thanks.

I have tried forwarding to newsgroups but don't know how. What
I usually do is reply back. If I want to take something off one
newsgroup and repost it to another group I hit reply then change
the name of the group with the name of the new group before sending.
I don't know any other way.

I've been receiving forwarded msgs that have colored and/or flashing text. I've asked everywhere, how this is done, but no one seems to know. All I know is that it has something to do with CHARACTER COMMANDS. Is there anyone out there with a list of 
commands or a suggestion as to where I could look for them?

I have a problem with pine.  I subscribed to the newsgroup alt.baldspot,
and it didn't work, so I tried it again 3 more times, and it worked the
third time.  Now I "?alt.baldspot" shows up on my screen 3 times, and I
can't delete them.  I've tried unsubscribing them, but everytime I go back
onto pine they come back.  Can you help?
Thanx,

	This is *highly* discouraged.  It is done with control characters.
The "problem" is that not all displays react the same to those control
characters.  Some will turn a person's screen into garbage which will
require a POMC (Power On Master Clear) to fix.

	So, be kind to your fellow human.

	Well, your date line showed:

Date: Thu, 26 Sep 1996 20:56:50 -0700 (MST)

	So, if you are in the Mountain Standard Timezone....and if it is
starting to get dark outside.....then you time shows 8:56PM.  Sounds
about right to me..

Try setting rich headers.
^R in the headers section.
and put the list in the bcc: field.
This will make the list invisible to the recipients.

I think he means that Bcc: is not visible in the headers.  In the header
section, hit ^R to get the rich headers.

That isn't an artifact of 3.95; every version of Pine has done that.

You shouldn't be using NFS for exporting mail from one machine to the
other.  Use IMAP instead.

try

"|command"

as a .forward file. Command should better be the full path of the
command/program/script you want to execute. Now you need some script
that extracts the information from the incoming mail and accesses the
site via a http connection, freeding it with the relevant information in
a format it expects.

Hello all,
 
When I want to post a message to a newsgroup I use my personal name
which is butterfly.  Usually (with the old version of pine), upon posting,
what others see when they look at my message in the index is my personal
name and the subject of the message.  This time, after posting, my
personal name did not appear.  Instead, it said, "To: 'newsgroup name'"
and the subject.

Could you please tell me how to configure my account so that when I post
a message my personal name appears again.

Thank you,

Helen

Bounce: re-mail message to correct recipient

The bounce (B) command allows you to re-send, or "remail", a
message, as if you were never in the loop.  It is analogous to crossing
out your address on a postal letter, writing a different address on the
envelope, and putting it into the mailbox. Bounce is used primarily to
redirect email which was sent to you in error.  Also, some owners of email
lists need the bounce command to handle list traffic.

The presence or absence of the Bounce command is determined by the
"enable-bounce-cmd" feature-list option in your Pine configuration. Note
that Bounce may be administratively disabled by your system manager; if it
doesn't work, please check with your local help desk before reporting a
bug.

The problem is (probably) at Fred Flintstone's end - his Date: header
is broken.

I seem to recall getting this behavior when replying to a French
person whose program put in _French_ month names. Clearly, pine
doesn't have a chance to understand that.

If mail is delivered directly to the mbox file (in the users' home
directory, you don't need to compile the mbox driver.  All you need to
do is include the following definition in your
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf file: 

	inbox-path=mbox

If mail is delivered to /usr/spool/mail and you want Pine to move
incoming messages to ~/mbox, build Pine as follows:

	build sol EXTRADRIVERS=mbox

Good luck!

We need more information than that.  What version of Pine are you

We read as much of the incoming mail as we can, but with 130+
messages/day coming in, we wouldn't get anything done if we answered
each one personally.

Between the online help text (press ^G) and the man page, I think the
documentation is basically complete.  Pico does not have any
"advanced" capabilities hidden away anywhere.  There are some
references to Pico in the Tech Notes, but most of that is covered in
the help text or man page...

There are also a few X options in pine's config, for things like enabling
the mouse, changing the icon (when minimized) to indicate new mail.

Hello,

I'd like send 8bit text (other languages mixed with English) in PINE
without any encode, neither base64 nor quoted-printable. But I can't
find how to config PINE to do that. Is it possible in PINE?


Thank you in advance,

Qin

The (S)ave command is what you want.  Use the (A)pply command to (S)ave the
messages to another folder.  Pine's default action is then to mark the moved
messages as deleted in the current folder.

Hallo there.  I work for my university's Information Systems department,
and we're trying to put together information packets for new students
about the unix email system.  I have been able to find plenty of info on
the web about unix commands and the vi editor we support, and even
plenty of info about pine, but next to NOTHING about pico!!

The only information about pico i can find is a basic list of commands,
which is the same list that is always displayed at the bottom of the
editing screen!  I tried the U. Washington homepage, the pine homepage,
nothing!  (you'd think that they'd have info about the program they
wrote).  I wrote email to them and got an automated reply (which also
said i would get no personal reply) (what is the point of having a way
to email them if no human ever reads it?)

Is the reason i am finding NILL on pico because it has NO advanced
capabilities, and the only commands available are the ones on the
screen? It seems there MUST be more to things than that.  Is there at
least a FAQ out there or SOMETHING?

Please help me out, or at least point me in the right direction for
finding answers.  

I dont check this newsgroup, so if you could please send any replies to
rhoffman@sph.jhu.edu i would really appreciate it.  Thanks!

Hi!

How do you change the text that appears at the top of a reply message?
Instead of "On Wed, 25 Sep ... wrote:" I would like to insert something i=
n
swedish. I run pine under Unix (if that information is needed).

Thanks,

I'm using pine in conjunction with coolmail (a substitute of xbiff),
starting it from .xinitrc (Linux) in such a way:

coolmail -geometry 95x70-0+660  -int 30 -e "xterm -T PINE -n pine -e pine" &

In the small coolmail-window new mail is flagged; then I click on the
window and the xterm with pine is opened.

Is your system Unix ?

If so, we have a lot of machines on a network
In /etc on the server we have a file called aliases
In there are alaises for users on the system, and also groups of people
EG

fredf		fredf@bedrock
betty		betty@bedrock
wilma		wilma@bedrock

flintstones	fredf,wilma,betty

So you would send mail to flintstones@server, and the aliases 
does the rest.

Hope that helps, or steers you in the right direction

coolmail comes with Linux. You can compile it for Solaris. Check prior the
definition of the spool file.

Not really.  There are various MMs but Columbia MM can do both mbox and
mail.txt, and we're using mbox format here for the mbox file.  Pine
and MM are fairly compatible if you have Pine using the mbox driver;
the main difference is how they flag messages, e.g. marking what was
seen.  Remind people to kill MM before running Pine in the same
session, or a suspended MM will yell about the file changing out from
under it, and save its version too.



The mbox driver is included in the c-client package, but is not used in the
Makefile.  Make a change something like this in Makefile:

from:
DEFAULTDRIVERS=imap nntp pop3 mh tenex mtx mmdf bezerk news phile dummy

to:
DEFAULTDRIVERS=tenex mh mbox imap bezerk nntp mtx news mmdf phile dummy

You have to get the mbox driver ahead of imap so it tries it first.
The mbox driver will be used if there is a non-empty mbox file in the
account.  If there is no mbox or an empty mbox, it will skip to the
next driver, e.g. imap.


To force use of mbox for people who only use Pine, you'd need to do 2
things.  First, bezerk.c has to accept an empty mbox as valid:

bezerk.c 141
<     if (!sbuf.st_size)errno = 0;/* empty file */
---
>     if (!sbuf.st_size) {
>       errno = 0;/* empty file */
>       ret = T;
>     }

Second, you'd have to touch mbox as Pine starts.  Shell wrapper?

Subject: specifying login name for remote folder
Date: 27 Sep 1996 09:46:40 -0400
Message-Id: <52gls0$k7v@net161-61.student.yale.edu>

  I'm wondering if there's any way to specify 'user-name'(login name)
when defining remote folder/folder-collection. I've got a few
accounts on different machines with different login-name and
Pine prompts me for login-name with default set to local
login name of mine when I try to access remote folder/folder
collection on hosts where I have login name different than
local login name. In case it's not possible as of Pine 3.95,
I suggest following scheme for remote folder/folder collection
definition.

 {loginname#password@remote.host.somewhere.net}inbox
 {loginname#password@remote.host.somewhere.net}dir/[]

  Of course, password should not be displayed literally
(instead, it should be displayed as "****") and need to
be stored encrypted. Well, I guess most of use can type password everytime
when accessing remote folder(s), so that 'password' in
folder specfication is not as necessary as login-name
specification if security could be compromised with
password. 

  Another question/suggestion is if there's any way to
avoid entering login/password when I press 'L'(Folder
List) from the main menu. Pine 3.95 prompts me for
login name/password whenever I press L with remote
folder/folder collection defined in folder list even if
I just wanna see the local folder list. I found turning off
'expanded folder collection view'  does the job(i.e.
it doesn't ask for login/password when pressing L
and ask for them only when I expand a remote folder collection).
If that's the only way, I propose next version of Pine
offer a way to turn 'expanded view of folder collection'
on and off per folder collection basis so that I can
turn off that for remote folder collection by default
and would be prompted for login/password when I expand
remote folder collection. 

    Jungshik Shin

   I would be greatly obliged to Pine team if  this would be considered 
carefully and reflected in next release of Pine.

Hello,

I've noticed that many folks seem to prefer the Unix Shell/Pine approach
for reading mail/news instead of going the PPP/SLIP route with all the
GUI interfaces.

Why this preference?  Is there something that's lacking in the GUI
readers that can be found by using a shell account with Pine?  Is there
more functionality using Pine?

Hi,

I need some help. I use distribution lists to send out mail. In the 
addressbook menu, I've listed (ungrouped) aliases for a lot of people; I've 
also created a separate (grouped) list where I use the aliases of the 
people created above. The problem is when I try to send mail to the 
grouped list, the list stops at the letter k and doesn't include email 
addresses after k.


I'll really appreciate any help.

PS: I don't have this problem if I type in the complete address in the 
grouped list.

	Ahhh....PPP/SLIP is transport related and has not much to
do with Unix shell.

	I beleive what you want to say is that the shell account is
preferred over the client/server approach.

	If you are asking the question as it relates to pine and PC-pine
the Windows version....then the answer is maturity.  If you are talking
about email in general...then I'm not sure your conclusion is accurate.

I had this same problem when accessing a global address book created with
Pine 3.95, while using Pine 3.91.  Upgrading to 3.95 cured the problem. 
You might want to check that.

Actually, you can change the "From" header even if that ability hasn't been
compiled in.  Compose your message, then *postpone* it instead of sending it.
Suspend or exit Pine, then use a text editor to edit your postponed-msgs file,
changing the line starting with "From:" as you wish.  Save the file, resume or
restart Pine.  Use "c" to continue composing your postponed message, then send
it using "CTRL-X" as usual.  The recipient sees the "From:" header you want, and
"reply" sends to that address, but full headers will show where the message
really came from.

    You can try, although there is no guarantee that you will be
successful every time, simply because worldwide Internet standards 
are still 7-bit.

    However, if your version of Pine is recent (I forget when the
feature came in), from the Main Menu go into Setup and Config.  Scroll
down to enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation and be sure to read the online
help screen.  You should also probably specify a character set other
than USASCII.  With the 8-bit feature enabled, Pine will TRY to
negotiate an unmodified 8-bit transmission.  If the negotiation is
succcessful, Pine will send your message unmodified 8-bit.  If the
negotiation fails, Pine will fall back to its standard 7-bit encodings,
such as Quoted-Printable or base64.

    Note that this depends in large measure on the receiving system and
the transmission path (possibly), so there is no assurance that it will
work every time.  (I think that successful 8-bit transmission also
requires a compatible mail transfer agent on your system.)

To who may know it,
what is the difference between shared and gobal addressbooks? I understand
the idea of these two but not how to implement shared addressbooks.
I went through the pine FAQ and the archive and there is some info about
global addressbooks. I would appreciate if someone can inform me about
shared addressbooks and how to implement them.

To who may know it,
what is the difference between shared and gobal addressbooks? I understand
the idea of these two but not how to implement shared addressbooks.
I went through the pine FAQ and the archive and there is some info about
global addressbooks. I would appreciate if someone can inform me about
shared addressbooks and how to implement them.
Greetings, Markus

The definition are actually

	{remote.host.somewhere.net/user=loginname}INBOX
	{remote.host.somewhere.net/user=loginname}dir/[]

The password cannot be specified.  This works in Pine 3.92 and later.

Pine is supposed to keep the last password you used for each server
for the duration of a session.  We will investigate this further...

We'll keep this in mind!

What is the appropriate syntax for a remote news collection via nntp when a
different user name must be specified?

I had no luck with *{news.remote.host/nntp/user=login}[] on the news
collections line, with a 2nd machine, news.remote.host, specified on the nntp
line.

Has anyone been able to successfully compile pine 3.95 in the NeXTstep FAT

machines that include the NeXT m68k boxes, hppa's and Intels.

Any help would be appreciated.

    DO NOT DO THIS!!!! 

    Many people think this is cute.  Unfortunately, you have no control
over what kind of terminal device or computer the recipient is using. 
For some recipients, control characters in the stream will do cute
things.  For other recipients, such control characters may do very
nasty things, and the recipients will curse your name to the skies.  I
suggest that you just forget it.

    (Another suggestion is that when you compose messages, you put in
some hard line-ends.  Your first list was four screens wide.  I am sure
others will appreciate it as well.)

    Yes, this is easy to do with tools such as procmail (which I use)
and filter.  You do not need any shell scripts for procmail.  Nancy
McGough has a lot of good information on how to set up mail filtering. 
If you have a WWW browser, browse my home page: I have a link to
Nancy's site (and a mirror) where you can get a lot of directions.

    a node name to automatically connect to when you start the emulator.

    Syntax:  /node=nodename

    Where:   nodename is the name of the desired node and can be up to
             32 characters. Do not put this name in quotes.

    Example: In the properties dialog box, enter the following as a
             command line:

             C:\ACADIA\APPS\VT320W.EXE /node=kronos

    This option overrides any node name specified in the Auto Connect
    field of the Setup:Communications dialog box.  If the Auto Connect
    port has been specified (with or without a Node Name), this port
    will be used for the connection.

    For Example: If you are running the DECNET version (i.e. 2.40-DD.16),
                 and if you specified CTERM as the Auto Connect Port,
                 then the /node option will use CTERM as the desired
                 port. Otherwise, if you specified LAT or None, then
                 the /node option will use LAT as the desired port.


 2. NOTABLE 2.13 ENHANCEMENTS
 ----------------------------

  - Added Private ESCape sequence to set the number of terminal lines:

    <ESC>[7;nn| where nn is the number of lines (range 24 thru 48).

    This is the equivalent of the following Emulator Command Language (ECL)
    command:

    SET TERM /LINES=nn	where nn is 24 thru 48.

  - Added VT420 ESCape sequence to set the number of terminal lines:

    <ESC>[nnt	where nn is the number of lines (range 24 thru 48).

    Note: this has been enhanced as compared to the VT420 sequence
    (which only supports nn values 24, 25, 36 and 48).  Also note that
    values of 72 and 144 are not implemented.


 3. NOTABLE 2.xx FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
 ----------------------------------------

  OPERATIONAL CHANGES
  ===================
  The following operational concepts have changed.

  -FILE TRANSFER: monitor status in minimized mode

     You can monitor the progress of file transfers even while minimized
     through a small, concise status window. This feature helps you spot
     a transfer problem immediately and/or gives you constant reassurance
     that the tranfser is proceeding normally while you're running another
     application. In previous versions, you could not monitor the file
     transfer progress while minimized.


  -FILE TRANSFER: Receive - "*.*" makes Filenames Derived from Host

     In V1.x of VT320 for Windows, when "*.*" was entered as the PC
     filename and the Host Filename was empty, the file transfer
     would ask the host for each filename that it found on the PC.

     In V2.xx of VT320 for Windows, this has been disabled.

  -FILE TRANSFER: Selecting Multiple Files

     To select multiple sequential files, click on the first file,
     drag the cursor to the last file to select, and release the mouse
     button. Another option is to click on the first file to select,
     press and hold the Shift button, then click on the last file to
     select.

     To select non-sequential files in the list, hold the Control key
     while clicking on each file. To deselect any file, click on the
     filename again, while holding the Control key.


  -MOUSE SETTINGS: Changes to the dialog box.

     The Save button has been removed from the Mouse Settings dialog box.
     The selections are now saved automatically when the OK button is
     clicked.


  -SCROLLBACK - Toggling Scrollback Mode with Right Mouse Button

     The right mouse button no longer toggles scrollback mode.


  -SCROLLBACK SCROLLBAR:

     The vertical scrollbar associated with scrollback memory can now
     appear in an alternate location when maximized. This location is
     to the upper right of the emulation window. When in this location,
     the full width of the screen is usable by text in the emulation
     window. In previous versions, the scrollbar was directly to the
     right of the emulation window, which prevented the entire screen
     width from being used for text, resulting in a smaller font.

     When maximimized, clicking the scrollback scrollbar button (to the
     right of the status line) will switch this scrollbar's location from
     the alternate location, to the normal location, and then turn it off
     (and so on).

  -TOOLBAR SETTINGS: Changes to the dialog box.

     The Save button has been removed from the Toolbar Settings dialog box.
     The selections are now saved automatically when the OK button is
     clicked.


  -WINDOW POSITION - Saving

     VT320W will now save the current window position upon exit.


  -Log File Record - Stopping a recording

     To stop a log file recording, click on File - Record Log File. The
     checkmark (indicating a log in progress) will disappear.


  -Connect - Session Name doesn't appear when COM port selected

     Because the Session name for a COM connection is not needed,
     it was removed. The Session name group only appears when
     making a network connection is selected.


  Command Language Changes
  ========================
  The following commands were changed.

  SET TERMINAL /LINES=nn     - Added: 24-48 line screens
    Where: nn - is the number of screen lines from 24 through 48.

  SET TERMINAL /NOPROTOCOL   - Deleted: Use /PROTOCOL=None

  SET TERMINAL /NOPARITY     - Deleted: Use /PARITY=None

  SET TERMINAL /[NO]PSEUDO   - Deleted: Not used anymore

  SET MESSAGE [location]     - Deleted: All messages go to status line.

  LOG /TEXT
    Records only the text and ignores the control sequences.

  READ SCREEN [row,col] Symbol-name
                             - Added: Reads information from the screen
    Where:
           row - The row of the screen to read
           col - The column of the screen to start reading. If col is not
                 specified, column 1 is used.

  Reads a specific row of text from the screen into the symbol.

    Example:

     This command will read all of the text on line 1 of screen, starting
     at column 10, into the variable text.

     READ SCREEN [1,10] TEXT


Loading Alternate Setup Files

Here is another method for loading alternate setup files.

   1. Edit the Program Item Properties for the VT320W icon.

   2. Add the name of the alternate setup file to the end of the
      current Command Line.

      Example:  C:\ACADIA\APPS\VT320W.EXE VTNEW.SET

   3. Press the OK button.

      Each time the VT320W program is run, it automatically
      loads the setup file VTNEW.SET.


List Box File Selection

  To select sequential files, click on the first file to select, then drag
  the cursor to the last file to select.  Or, click on the first file,
  press the shift key and then click on the last file.

  To select non-sequential files, hold the control key and click on the
  file.  To deselect any file, click on the filename again, while holding
  the control key.

DDEDEMO
=======

The DDEDEMO for VT320W demonstrates some of the Dynamic Data Exchange(DDE)
capabilities of the emulator. Look at the commands in the command (.ECF)
file for examples of how to write your own DDE scripts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DDEDEMO includes the following files:

  DDEDEMO.EXE - A Windows DDE Server application that provides Date/Time
                and the estimated United States population.

  DDEDEMO.ECF - A Command file

  DDEDEMO.TXT - What you are reading now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the DDE Demo:

1. Run the DDEDEMO.EXE program. The demo only runs as an ICON and cannot
   be maximized (it may appear that nothing happened after double-
   clicking it).

2. Start VT320W, if not already running.

3. Run the Command File DDEDEMO.ECF using the File|Command menu selections.

The DDE demo displays a screen that indicates the current time and US
population. This information is provided by the DDE server.

The ECF file runs for 30 seconds.

Make the signatures you need and store them in different files e.g in
you home directory and use ^R in pico to insert this files.

If the files are named something short this saves you a lot of typing!

It would be great if there were a command like T (TakeAddr)
which would present all the URLs in a message and then allow
you to pick and choose which ones to add to your ACAP-accessible
universal bookmark file.

We, too, were having a similar problem.  Although we weren't getting any junk
characters on the second page, we always got a second (blank) page printed after
each e-mail message.  We use FTP Software's On Net package to provide TCP/IP
connectivity to Windows users.

We've fixed the problem (in Pine 3.95) by setting the Pine printer to 
"attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed" using the Setup option on the Main Menu.

I am having a problem writing and sending mail. If my message is longer
then a line it has been telling me "disc quota exceeded". I have no saved
messages, and only 2 in my in-box. I also have a few addresses. This is
becoming a problem since I would like to send longer messages.

Hi please if possible, post the answer on the group, of course and email 
me because sometimes I've problems to retry the news.......thanks.

I have a signature written with "pico" (pico .signature) and when I use 
pine the sign. automatically appears on the bottom. If I don't want to 
send my signature without delete the file .signature, what can I do?

Thanks for having read the text.
Talk to you later.....

I don't think that this is fixable through the Pine application.  This
is something that BC has control over.  You could create new folders
to store the messages you want to save.  That way they will be stored
on your memory and not the school's server.

What program generates the following message & why?

"Reposting article removed by rogue canceller"

Earlier this week, there were a number of "cancelled messages" in my
inbox; then during the week I noticed a number of messages that contained
this message as the first line.  Just curious.

   Sorry, it's impossible. 8bit characters in mail header including
Subject is explicitely prohibited by RFC 1522 and STD 10/11 and
Pine strictly adheres to those standard and doesn't allow 8bit
characters in mail header without B/Q encoding as specified in
RFC 1522. You'd better ask your correspondents to get
MIME-compliant mail user agent/POP3 client like Pine,Netscape-Mail,
MS Internet Mail,MIME-enabled Elm which have no trouble decoding
B/Q encoded header.

You can do two things:

1. Create entries in your addressbook for people to whom you send mail that you
   routinely want in a folder other than sent-mail.  Using the addressbook, even
   for a user on your own system and using as the nickname the "real" username,
   allows you to specify a default Fcc folder.

2. Modify your "default-composer-hdrs" option under setup to include the "Fcc"
   header.  This way, for any outgoing message, you have an in-your-face
   reminder that you can change the default Fcc value.  (You should always be
   able to do this using the CTRL-R command to view rich headers while in the
   headers section of your outgoing message.)

It was most likely because there was another Pine session open.

   Yes.

    First, while the cursor is in the header area of your message,
press Ctrl-R to see if Bcc: is already defined in your configuration. 
If it is not, from the Main Menu go into Setup and Config.  Scroll down
to default-hdrs: and add it.

    A work of warning.  If you use Bcc:, make sure *something* (if
nothing else, your own address) is in the To: field, or the Bcc:
entries may no longer be "blind."

    Yes, it is certainly possible (a lot of us do it), but Pine itself
will not do it for you.  You need a technique which will route the mail
as part of the delivery process before Pine ever touches it.  There are
various ways to do it (often called mail filtering).  Nancy McGough has
a lot of good material on this in her WWW pages.  I never remember her
URL, but I have a link to her pages from my home page.

  An alternative is save your signature with a short file name, such as
"s" (that's what I used). Whenever you're composing and you want to
include your signature, just press ^R, s, (Enter key). These keystrokes
will import your signature file into the e-mail that you're composing.
  Hope this helps.

You are not very clear on what you did ;-( When you say you have changed
read/write permission for your account, do you mean your home directory
permissions ? You /var/spool/mail<user> (INBOX) permission ? Or something
like chmod -R <perms> . ?

A simple test will be to look at the size of your mail folder (INBOX).
Assuming you are running Unix, you could do "ls -l <path-of-INBOX>",
and see if the size is changing.

Once you see the INBOX with > 0 bytes in it, next you can see the pine
configuration (~/.pinerc) to make sure you have the right filename set
for your inbox. (variable inbox-path)

If that appears to be fine, you might want to consult your system admin,
who can throw some more light on this problem.

Later,
-Roy-

You need to change to a newer version of pine. (Current: 3.95.)
Since 3.92 there has been a Setup/Config option: newsrc-path.

The command is 
$ Mail -F ""

don't forget the double quotes at the end.  They are important ( I don't 
know why I assume it's a path thing)

Sure, it works fine, but it does take up a bit of space for those with
limited storage.

Type in a ";" while in the index. You can then select messsages in several
different ways, including by date or text. Then you can perform a single
command on the whole group by hitting "a" and selecting a command from the
menu that appears.

	Sure....

	From the m(ain) menu, go to a(ddressbook).  Then type "?" for help and do
some
"Information Research".  If, after you've done "Information Research" you
still don't understand...
then come on back.

	Hint:  While doing "information research" you will find a section
entitled "Distribution
Lists".  This may be a good section to read.

	Regards,

		Ed

Is there a way to adjust the tab size in pico?  I'm on a unix box and am

this - any suggestions?

thanks...

For Pc-Pine I don't know, but I'm using mkpgp2.1 under Linux.  It's a Perl
script so I'm sure it'll work with any flavor of Unix Pine.

ftp://ftp.rivertown.net/pub/unix/privacy/mkpgp2.1.tar.gz

...and if you're looking for some PGP-related links (or something for
PC-Pine) you might find it at http://pgp.rivertown.net/

    You don't (with any version of Pine).  Talk and chat are
independent programs that have nothing to do with Pine.  There
may be other newsgroups that deal with these activities, but 
your best bet is to inquire of your help desk.

Hi,

  I recently saw the answer to one of my questions about the login
name for the INBOX on an IMAP connection, but I still have a problem
with it.

My login name on the UNIX server I'm running is "shelton", while my login 
name for my IMAP account is: "bsshelton".

When I send mail, the from address always reads "shelton@mail.utexas.edu"
Instead of "bsshelton@mail.utexas.edu".

Is there any way to override the default lookup for the local username?

-Bryan Shelton

Hi! I am not a regular reader of this newsgroup, but I hope you can help
me anyway.

We have installed Pine 3.95 for Windows 95 on several public access
workstations. When toolbars and dialog boxes are turned on, and we try to
send a message, pine crashes with an "invalid instruction" error. If we
turn off either dialog boxes or the toolbar it works. I should mention
that Pine is running from a Novell server. However, even if it is run
from the local hard disk, the same crash occurs.

Has anyone encountered this problem? I would appreciate any feedback you
can give me.

I am moving my PINE mail to another account (both have v. 3.95), but I am
having trouble transporting the INBOX. My folders and addressbook were easy
with ftp (simply overwrite the old stuff), but there is no INBOX folder in
my home or mail directory.

Does anyone know how to move the INBOX over?

Hi, guys and gals, I was hoping to find some help.  Does anyone know
how to use PINE (if it can be used) to filter incoming mail?  I've been
recieving a lot of scam mail from the good old folks at interramp and
AOL, and I would like to put up some sort of filtering system.
So if any of you know how, please drop me a line at:

Are the INBOXes NFS mounted?  If so, you are probably running into
file locking failures.  Pine does the best it can, but over NFS it is
a no-win situation.  Converting to IMAP access for remote folders will
alleviate the locking problems.

FWIW, The last reports I've heard indicate that Sun will be
deprecating NFS access to mail in favor of IMAP in their next
generation of mail software...

    Yes, this is easy to do with tools such as procmail (which I use)
and filter.  You do not need any shell scripts for procmail.  Nancy
McGough has a lot of good information on how to set up mail filtering. 
If you have a WWW browser, browse my home page: I have a link to
Nancy's site (and a mirror) where you can get a lot of directions.

They are NFS mounted, but I don't believe that that is the problem.  We
had others using pine on other workstations with NFS mounted spools and
they did not experience the same problem I am seeing until I switched them
over to CDE, under Solaris 2.5.  Originally, we thought it might be amd
timeouts (we use amd, rather than automounter), but we disproved that one.
It may still turn out to be lock contention, but it will probably be
caused by something other than NFS (although I have been wrong before :-).
I have pine running with -d9 set and we will see if that tells us
anything.

Oh goodie.  Something else to install :-).

All global-address-book's are ReadOnly to simplify access contention
problems.  If you want to manually update a global addressbook, list
it as one of your personal addressbooks.

That specification is correct.  Have you tested the IMAP server
manually?  You can do this by telnetting to port 143 on the server. 
If you allow pre-authenticated (rsh) access, try "rsh host.wherever
/etc/rimapd".

I've never seen that problem or any reports that were even similar. 
Does the broken Message-ID appear in the copy of the message in your
sent-mail folder?  If that copy is normal, some process outside of
Pine is corrupting the Message-ID...

Yes we have it here also.  I think it's something to do with the way nfs

I solved it by having procmail deliver everything to my mail directory.
Procmail and pine seem to be very good about keeping out of eachother's
way, and honoring file locks.

No, that was not in the Date: line, that was at the end of the Path:.
There was a Date: line too, which showed 21:00:00 or something.

My wild guess at what is happening:

Your (Patricia's) Date: header is first in your message. There is an
error in whatever program generates the original "Path:" header, such
that it does not end in an end-of-line, and therefore your original
Date: header ends up on the end of the Path: line.

A little later, your message will be transfered to the server, which
will believe there is no Date: in your message, and generate its own.

Possibly the starting Path: is in a file somewhere, and someone has
used an editor which does not automatically put EOL characters at the
end of a file (I recall xedit doesn't, at least.) Ask your system
administrator to fix this.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Strange.

I suggest you try "pico .newsrc" from your UNIX prompt to edit the file
containing the list of newsgroups directly, and delete the extra lines.

Add a "From:..."-header to the customized headers. If this doesn't work
you have to recompile pine after changing the option ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM
in the file pine/osdep/os-***.h (*** stands for your operating system).

	Try not to say "no" too quickly.  It is more approriate to say
something along the lines of "that is not what I'm seeing".

	I'm telling you what I see.  I've attached the full message
from Patricia which showed up in my mail.  I don't normally read the
newsgroup but read the gatewayed email.

	So, to me, everything looks fine....and I dare say the header
show it.

	Regards,

		Ed

The answer to your question is:

You can not, because this decision is not under Pine's control.

These locks are between Pine and sendmail's delivery program (usually
/bin/mail).  The authors of /bin/mail (or whatever you used) decided that
their lock is on /var/spool/mail.  If Pine is to lock against the sendmail
delivery program, it must write the locks that the sendmail delivery
program uses.

Of course, you can modify the Pine source code, but if you don't also
modify the /bin/mail source code with corresponding changes then there is
no locking between Pine and sendmail.

"No locking between Pine and sendmail" is the situation you have now; that
is why you are getting a warning message.  In older versions of Pine, you
got no warning message.  You just didn't have locking unless your
/bin/mail respected the 4.3BSD flock() convention on /var/spool/mail (very
few systems do this today since it doesn't work over NFS), and every so
often you would get lost messages or other mail file corruption.

What you need to do is permit world write access on /var/spool/mail with
the sticky bit; that is, protection 1777.

Pine also has a separate lock against other invocations of Pine; these use
/tmp.  That's right, there are *TWO* locks.

It also leads one to wonder if it was such a good feature to add in the
first place.  Maybe it should have been a selectable option, rather than
the default.

That is a great tip from Mike, but considering the weekly number of questions
regarding this issue, it would seem that a more nature default (by which I
mean the one that people expect initially) would have been the index format 
that Mike shows in the second line, not the actual default.

Then, true power users could change their index format so that it uses the
fromorto while the newbies get the behavior they expect.

No, I'm not saying that people should be excused from reading the
documentation and I certainly don't feel there's any excuse for the FAQs
this newsgroup sees, but it does seem to be an unfortunate choice for a
default.

Message-Id: <52bt9r$8qe@unix.sri.com>

We are transitioning our MM users to pine, and we would like for
the user to be able to continue to use their existing mbox files
as INBOX. The FAQ mentions having to enable the mbox driver to
allow this, but does not mention where the driver can be found.
I've checked the tech notes and all the group archives, and I can
not find any reference to where the driver can be found. Can
someone enlighten me?

Thanks,

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

OK, this is bending my brain a bit, and I'd like some help/ideas to tell
me if what I want done can be done *cleanly* :-).

I have a machine, which has a hostname (and obviously an email domain)
which I want to keep intact for other users of the machine.

So, my machine has say, an A address of machine-1.domain.com.

Which is fine, or should be.

But I have a different email address at machine-2.domain.org, which I want
to use instead of pabooth@machine-1.domain.com.

I thought it would be possible using re-writing rules in Sendmail, which I
did, and which works fine for mail, elm and probably mush.

Trouble is, I'm using pine, and it doesn't work.

Is there any way of doing this? I'd like to keep some of the features of
pine like looking in the passwd fine to qualify addresses and such.

I know that setting:

'user-domain' = machine-2.domain.org would work but this would mean that
any unqualified mail would be made up as users@machine-2.domain.org which
isn't the local machine so is defeating the objecting. I could turn this
off using 'compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs' but I wouldn't get local
lookup then :-).

Argh. Why can't pine just let sendmail rewrite headers? :-).

Just out of interest, if I was to set 'compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs'
it would override 'quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file' wouldn't it?

Cheers for your time,

Paul.

PINE is only a mail user agent. It doesn't provide any facilities to
filter incoming mail. On UNIX platforms, try man procmail and man filter.
The latter comes with the ELM distribution.

Using IMAP doesn't bring you to your remote account. It only gives you
access to that account. Therefore, whenever you reply to a mail, your
current e-mail is given as the sender.

Make sure you have 'enable-aggregate-command-set' and
'enable-flag-command' on in the setup->config.

Then use 
	; A A * ! N

; A = Select all messages
A * = Apply flag command to selection
! N = Flag as 'not new'

	You may be right that it was an unfortunate choice....but I'm
sure the creators had their reasons.  Maybe it was to satisfy the needs
of the folks paying the bill for writing pine?  In any case, pine has
gotten so "feature rich" that it seems quite impossible to please everyone
with the default settings.  I, for one, am happy with that particular
default setting.  Maybe that is why I didn't investigate how to change
it.  (Narrow minded on my part I must say....)  But anyway, you have to
credit the pine folks for giving you plenty of features and allowing
you the flexibility to change things as you see fit.  All for the
amazing low price of *free*.

  Or the Lcc field....which may yield better results since if you forget
to put something in the To: field when you use the Bcc field you may
endup with sendmail adding an "Apparently-To:" field.

That was Chris Lewis, resurrecting as many article as possible. comp.mail.pine
(and its mirror, the pine-info mailing list) were hit by the rogue canceller.

Excerpts from his article:

Over the weekend, someone using sophisticated cancel-generating software
posted nearly 30,000 cancels forged in the name of the original posters.
The cancels purport to be legitimate spam/advisory cancellations, but,
it is clear that they weren't.  It appears that someone ran a program
that simply listened into inbound Usenet on a server, and generated
cancels for every article it saw in the groups it was listening to.  The
cancels were labeled with "tags" indicating why they were cancelled, but
these tags were simply labels assigned to the groups the program
was listening to.  If it was a alt.sex group, it got "twatcancel".
If it was a comp.* group, it got "geekcancel".

In essence, then, in the jargon of news.admin.net-abuse.misc, a Usenet-wide
UDP (cancel every article in usenet) was operating for a time.

As of this date, then, 18304 articles were resurrected from 27474 cancels.

<end excerpts>

To follow the discussion, read Chris Lewis's full article, with the subject
"Massive cancel attack report" in news.admin.net-abuse.announce or 
news.admin.net-abuse.misc. The discussion takes place in the latter newsgroup.

Safe transfer of 8bit characters is only one of the issues.
Another is the charset labelling.

Unless a sender (either naively or arrogantly) assumes that all recipients
of a message use the same charset as the sender, it must be idenitified
in the header/text.  RFC-1522 specifies how to do that, and the need for 
charset labelling makes MIME essential even if you postulate an 8bit-clean
transmission path.

  Yes, it's essential to label charset used in header. Sometimes,
however, giving users to choose what to do with 8bit chars in header
(let them decide whether or not put 8bit chars encoded or as they are)
is not a bad idea. That's even more the case for local news groups or
particular set of newsgroups in which particular language/charset is
assumed to be used. Yet Another Newswatcher for Mac let users specifiy
primary charset per newsgroup basis( i.e. For major six
hierarchies,fr.*,de.*,and many Western European groups, use ISO-8859-1,
han.* for  EUC-KR, fj.* for ISO-2022-JP, etc) , so that fonts
corresponding to predesignated charset for a particular newsgroup is
used automatically without relying on header information, which is
sometimes incorrect either due to misconfiguration by user or inability
of program and/or ignorance of programmer to put charset name other than
ISO-8859-1 in the header). This is quite a nice idea, IMHO. Of course,
those primary charsets should be overridable for particular news article.
The same mechanism can be used in Pine.  If RFC 1522 style-information
about charset is missing, assume 8bit chars in header are those in
primary charset for that news group.  Although less desirable for mail
than for news article, similar thing can be done with mail message.

  I understand it's pretty tough to decide whether to give users more
freedom or force(?) them to stick to the standard and that Pine has been
on the latter side in most cases. As far as I know, however, allowing
8bit chars in news header is not so grave a violation of the standard as
using 8bit chars in mail header mostly because standard/RFCs regarding
news article format are outdated and even some RFC-to-be(son of 1036)
states that it's permissable to use 8bit  chars in closed circle of
newsgroups(e.g. local hierarchy. han.* newsgroups have used 8bit  EUC-KR
in both header and body from the beginning without any problem).

Pine 3.95 does not currently have that capability, but Pine 4.0 will.

Sure, just open an xterm. If you mean is there an X version of Pine, I 
have no idea.

Not only pine, but all the mailers I know so far, CAN'T do this. 

The best you can do is something like this.
Send the message to YOURSELF, and put the distribution list as bcc. When it 
reaches all, they will see that mail was sent from you to you !! They won't
know, who else got a copy.

Use procmail (which may already be installed on your system).  It is not
part of Pine: Pine is a "mail user agent" (allows you to read mail and 
prepare mail for sending), not a "mail delivery agent" (which shuffles
mail into, out of, or around in your computer system).  

See <URL:http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/procmail> for information on
procmail, where to get it, and links to other mail filtering information.

Hi,
	I am on a unix system. I am now on multiple mailing lists and 
receive close to 150 mails a day. I was wondering if I may be able to 
setup a filtering system such that the mails from the listservs can be 
saved in separate folders. I understand that filtering devices such as 
Procmail, Elm filter exist. I would like to use Procmail to set it up. 
One of my friends mentioned that I may have to set up a shell script to 
do the same. I also understand that it is possible to set up filtering in 
Eudora. However I am using Pine. Has anybody faced a similar situation (I 
am sure many would have). Can anybody guide me?
Thanks.
Balaji

Don't use anything other than procmail.

If you write your own, you risk losing email to an unforseen error,
whereas procmail is already setup to check for every know possibility.

It is also free, there are vast archives of examples, and a mailing list.

Most decent ISPs already have it installed.

...or if you're using fvwm, you can add the following to
/usr/lib/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc in one of your Popup menu definitions:

    Exec   "Pine"    exec xterm -e pine &

to run Pine without going to the shell.

At my site, the mail exchanger alters the "From" line to "First.Last@UC.EDU"
and users do not have to worry about it in Pine or other mail agents.  Can
you ask your sys adm to do the same?

  I've also asked this question before, but no one replied me. Perhaps we
have to modify the source program to do that.

  It may be the case that Michael's News server doesn't carry all the
articles in Usenet (this phenomenon is common), or Paul's article arrived
late at Michael's News server.

ok

I remember (from before my provaed upgraded pine to 3.94)

that I could have remote INBOXs and i had it working, but the inboxs wernt
realy remote but made by procmail. but i abbanded it do to the fact i
couldn't get procmail installed properls.

now things have changed, we have upgraded to 3.94 and due to resent bought
of spamming from interamp.com procmail has been installed on the server
(instead of evey one that wanted to use it having to install it
 indavidualy)

now i can rember how to set up the out inboxs, 8(

I'm afraid I disagree with the suggestion that the standard index-format
be changed to use "From" instead of "Fromorto"...

Certainly for e-mail folders Pine has used "Fromorto" for as far back as I
can remember.  (Some comments made by one person seem to imply that this
behaviour has only recently been introduced for newsgroups, however.  I
can understand and appreciate the Pine Team's desire to continue their
harmonisation of mail and news reading and making this change (if,
indeed, it has changed).)

Neither I nor any of our 10,000+ users seem to have any difficulty with
the concept or its use by default. 

I would hesitate about changing from such a useful default merely because
a few voice surpise by its behaviour.  I wonder how many people are happy
with the behaviour but are silent?  (Perhaps I should ask each of our
users to send a message to this group saying how happy they are with the
current default? ;-)

My feelings are that things may be helped somewhat by slightly improved
documentation about the action (perhaps reassuring that only the Index
Screen display is affected) and perhaps a brief explanation of why the
behaviour is this way. 

Cheers,

Hi Pine users,
  I've been having trouble with Pine 3.93 with my VT100 terminal.  I run
Pine in a UNIX shell. Normally my terminal is 24 rows in height.  But
whenever I exit from Pine 3.93, my VT100 terminal becomes 25 rows in
height, instead of 24 rows. This ruins my terminal program and makes the
screen a mess. 
  I didn't have this problem with Pine 3.91, though.
  Does anyone know the solution?
  Thanks in advance.

J. Tse

Make a little script called szpipe or something with the following
contents:

cat > temp
sz temp
rm temp

Then make sure it's in your path somewhere. You can type szpipe in the
pipe field and it should work.

I have a web page that describes the use of PGP with Pine (3.92 or newer)
on Unix machines (SGI in particular).  There is a short (a dozen lines)
shell script in this scheme.  A few configuration settings in Pine.  It
is quite simple and easy.  Please check it out:

	http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html

Note it is an underline "_", not a hyphen in the filename.

Cheers!

Good question!  I have the impression that the Pine team does not have a 
plan to port it to Mac.  It is a pitty.

Alternatively, you may want to try "MailDrop" on Mac if you want to do 
IMAP.  I like the alpha version (1.2a???) a lot, but my main use is Unix
Pine.

When I send an e-mail message in Pine, my ISP defaults to show it coming
from

 meyerbos@best.com

I would like to change this to show it coming from my domain name at Best
and would like it to appear as

 rarelaw@meyerbos.com

How can I do this?

Many thanks,

Joe Luttrell

Subject: bug in pine 3.95


I am reporting a bug in the 3.95 version of pine.  Below are
two uuencoded files.  The first one is an original version of
the file, the second one is the same, but it was sent through
pine 3.95.  The last line of the second entry has the "#.H"
converted to "#..H".  Sorry for such a long listing, but we felt
that you needed the file (we removed the last 2500 lines of 
each file).  The rest of the file had the same problem.  Certain
places had the "." converted to a "..".

I am sending this with the  regular mailer, not pine to let you 
see the problem.  My OS is linux 2.0.18.

Thanks,
Mikel

1 - Change your password by typing passwd in UNIX/Linux/whatever.
2 - It's because there is another Pine session running that needs to be quit.

Contact your ISP. You can usually get a copy of any deleted files from
their backups if you're quick about it (within 24-48 hours). Aside from
that, Unix isn't very forgiving with deletes. 

Good Luck

Hi sir it is me steven.I am a blind computer user.
I am an user of the pine software that is on
my internet vendor.
Recently I have been getting an error message in
this program which is error 25.
This error tells me that I cannot send email on the internet.
How do I get rid of this error message.
I do notice that I get this message from time to time
when I am sending email on the internet 
to other people who use this ervice.
If you have any feedback on this thing
it would be helpful to me with the info.
I will look for my mail during the week.
So good by for now.
Your friend, Steven

Subject: HELP!! Can't send e-mail to Mac
Date: 17 Sep 1996 18:51:50 GMT
Message-Id: <51ms06$47n@news1.io.org>

Need advice on sending e-mail with file attachment from a PC platform to 
a Mac platform.  I am using a 286 with DOS.  The e-mail reaches the 
destination but not the uploaded file.  I am told I should cut and paste 
the file content into the e-mail message, but I don't think I can cut and 
paste with 286 DOS.  What about converting the file - a WordPerfect 5.1 
file - into a DOS file or TEXT file?  How would I do that?  Any other 
suggestions?

Thanks,
Sheldon

Dear Pine,
	I have a huge problem.  I have been using pine since last year and
I have never had any problems until now.  I have not been able to get any
of my new messages.  They aren't where they have always been.  I have been
getting mail since early September and have read and replayed to those and
now the only things in my folder are from last year.  I am not able to 
get new mail.  The system tells me that I have mail but I am unable to
find it in any of my folders.  I know that people have been sending me
stuff and I am just not getting it.  It is also not a problem of the wrong
address because everyone sending me mail gets no return messege after
sending it to me.  No one at my local support staff knows what to do.
Please help.  
				Thanks,
				Sara Hawk, Ohio University

	You need to do a bit of testing....or maybe your support staff.

	Your header information shows your are using pine3.93 on an
OSF platform.  I'm not familar with OSF....but suspect it is a variation
on U*IX.  Also, we don't know if your mail is being accessed by direct
means or via IMAP.

	In any case, your "INBOX" is normally in /usr/spool/mail, or
/var/spool/mail with the name sh247995.  Check to see if that file
exists.  Check the size of the file.  Then send yourself mail.  See
if the size of the file increases.  What are the results?

	Do you have a .forward file in your home directory?

	Does you system have quotas on disk space?  Are you over the
limit?  Are you the only person having trouble?

	Regards,

		Ed

    I would say that you are probably out of luck, although there may
be faint hope.  What system are you running Pine under?  If it is
PC-Pine under MS-DOS, I presume that Pine is using the normal DOS file
structures.  IF YOU ARE QUICK ENOUGH (!), there are MS-DOS utilities
which may be able to recover your files -- maybe.  If you are running
Pine under some flavor of Unix, about all you can do is try to sweet
talk your system administrator to try to restore your files from the
most recent backup tapes -- presuming, of course, that backup tapes
were even made relatively recently, which is frequently not the case. 
Even if tapes were made, you will probably still lose something.  As
for Pine running on other systems, I cannot speak.  Unfortunately,
overall I would not be optimistic about your prospects.  Sorry.

I would like to know if there is any way to have mail automatically
placed into folders based on the "to"  or "reply to" address.  The purpose is to
have mail from mailing lists automatically placed into the appropriate
folders before I even use Pine.

Thanks,

	Yes, and my goodness this has been asked/answered more than a
few times in the past couple of weeks.

	One of the best (but some claim not the easiest) packages to
use is called "procmail".  It may be installed on your site...it may
not be.  You can ask your sysadmin and/or type "procmail -v" to see
if it is there.  If it is...then also type "man procmail" to see if 
the man pages are available.  If no man pages....well you'd better
get them first before trying to use procmail.

	If you need to pickup the sources they can be found at:

	ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de
as (g)zipped tar file:     /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz
as compressed tar file:    /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.Z

	There may even be a newsgroup devoted to procmail.  I know there
is a mailing list.

	Regards,

		Ed

This seems to have appeared at the same time as the index-format
option appeared.

My guess is, before that there was different behavior in newsgroups
and mail, or possibly different behavior in the sent-mail folder
versus other folders. (At least I seem to recall seeing To: at certain
places in the old days.) Certainly, it makes sense to have the
sent-mail folder using To:, since there every message is from
yourself, while it does not really make sense to use To: in newsgroups.

But since the index-format option was added, every folder has to behave
the same way (otherwise, the option would have to be split or made
more complicated), and they chose the only option which does not lose
information compared to the old system.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Excuse me while I remove this foot from my mouth.. I didn't see that
the message was coming through the mailing list.

There _is_ an error though, causing the original Date: header to merge
with the news Path: header. I guess it is in the pine-info ->
comp.mail.pine gateway. It appears in your message as well.
My wild guess about a file missing the last EOL character still stands.

As for Patricia's original problem, I don't know.
