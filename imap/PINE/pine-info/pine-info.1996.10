Hello,

I am running pc-pine for Win 95, using version 3.95 of the 32 bit version.
In general the product works pretty nice.

I have a problem with the automatic pruning facilities. I configured pine
to use a remote file as the sent-mail. This allows me to look at the sent
mail regardless of the platform. Whenever the beginning of the month rolls
in, the PC-Pine version nevers prompts me to prune the sent-mail. It
updates the prune date with no problem. I then went into the configuration
and altered the prune-folders. I set it with the following configuration:

    {cie0}~/mail/sent-mail and
    {cie0}~/mail/[] sent-mail.

Both configuration does not seem to allow the automatic pruning. Am I
doing something wrong?

To fix this problem, try the following steps:

Debugging step 1:

What happens when you issue the command
	rsh server exec /etc/rimapd
(substitute your server's name for the word "server").

Did you get the 30 second delay?

Debugging step 2:

Now, try the command
	telnet server 143
Did you presently get a line starting with "* OK" with no 30 second delay?
(Type "x logout" followed by a return to quit).

Diagnostic step:

If the answer to both debugging steps is "yes", then the problem is that
your site does not have the "rimap" preauthentication capability enabled. 
Normally, this would not be a problem; rimap would just be refused and it
would fall into ordinary IMAP.

But, your site also has disabled rsh.  Unfortunately, the way that it was
disabled is one that the rsh program does not recognize.  Most Internet
protocols recognize an IP or TCP level "refused" condition as meaning "go
away", but the authors of rsh decided that "refused" means "keep on
trying" instead.  Most common methods of disabling services, such as 
router filters and TCP wrappers, use a "refused" condition and don't know
how to do rsh's own funky way of refusing ("permission denied").

Remedial step for Pine 3.95:

If you have Pine 3.95, look for the following entry in .pinerc:

# Zero disables rsh altogether.
rsh-open-timeout=15

Change that "15" (or "5" or whatever it's set to) to "0".

Remedial step for older versions of Pine:

In .pinerc, change all references to the problematic server to include
":143" after the system name.  For example,

inbox-path={myserver}INBOX

should be changed to

inbox-path={myserver:143}INBOX

Be sure to also check your folder-collections and incoming folders as
necessary.  Don't change any NNTP references (e.g. news-collections).


If this doesn't seem to be what you need to do, please write again.

I'm trying to get pine to prune folders in addition to the fcc folder. I
added:

pruned-folders=~/Mail/autosave-person1,
       ~/Mail/autosave-person2

to my .pinerc. These are folders where I have procmail save messages
from certain individuals I made need later. I wasn't asked about pruning
these folders this morning. What am I doing wrong.

Thanks

Can't with Pine.

You can do it with procmail though.  Try 'man procmail'.

	I assume you d(elete)  (mark for deletion) then x(punge).
If so, you "may" be out of luck.  If you are running PC-Pine and
Win95 they may still be in your "Recycle-Bin".  If you are on
U*IX pine maybe your sysadmin had done a file system backup.

	Good Luck

When I have the option "sort inbox by date" (vs. default of arrival)
enabled, when pine starts it leaves an annoying "Sorting inbox - 100%
complete" (or something to that affect) message on the main menu. 
Couldn't this be cleared after a second or so?  When it sends mail, and
gets 100% complete, that message doesn't stay on the screen.  Seems one
would like to be consistent.  This is unix pine compiled on DEC OSF,
etc, latest verisons, on alphas.

I do not think you can do this just with your .forward file I think you
need to look at something like procmail. check out man procmail and man
procmailex.

	All my email comes to a single logon on a unix machine at work
(lets call it fbloggs@workmachine.somedomain).  I sit at a PC, so I am
using PC-Pine to read and send mail and it all works a treat. 

	At home I have a linux machine with access to the internet via a
service provider (lets call it fred@homemachine.anotherdomain).  I have
now installed pine 3.95 on it and can also read and send email from there. 

	My PC-Pine setup asks me for a username and passwd once when I
start it up and from then on it all just works.  Unfortunately my linux
pine asks me for a username and password every time I turn around.

	Is there any way I can make it behave similarly to the PC-Pine and
just ask me the once at startup ?

	I have a number of folder collections on the email machine, and my
linux box is set up to use the email host for sending mail as well (rather
than using a local sendmail setup).

	Please reply by email to S.Oldfield@nla.gov.au.

Thanks in advance
Simon Oldfield

Try as I might, I cannot find a way of getting either Eudora Lite or

Is it possible? How please?

Can someone please suggest how I can set the default editor to jove?

I have tried combinations of

enable-alternate-editor-implicitly
editor=/usr/local/bin/jove

in my .pinerc without success.

I can get into jove using ^_ but how do I get it to come up automatically?

Sure you can look at "empty-header-message" of setup configuration.

I wish to use PC Pine to send but not receive.  My site has no IMAP

Put your list address in the "Lcc" header instead of the "To" header and your
recipients will see the list name in the "To" field rather than all the
individual addresses.  If you're using a version of Pine prior to 3.95, use the
"Bcc" header instead and put your own address in the "To" header.  Bcc and Lcc
can be revealed using CTRL-R while in the header section of your message, if
they're not already visible.

	It need not be installed in a "system" area.  You can have it
in your (for example) $HOME/bin directory.

Anonymous ftp to ftp.cac.washington.edu, cd to pine/unix-bin-compressed,
set binary mode, and mget *.sun.Z

When you get the files in your home directory, uncompress each, and chmod
+x each executable. 

You will have pine, pico, and pilot.

I think that's all you need to do.

	Your question is very broad.  Do you need to know information
about the compliation of pine or will you simply acquire pre compiled
binaries from the ftp.cac.washington.edu?

	If you acquire the pre-compiled binaries for the platform you
are using you could simply place it in a directory which is contained
in your PATH and change permissions to 555 or 111.

	If this is not sufficient to answer your request then I'm
afraid you'll have to be a bit more specific as to what type of
information you need.  BTW, if I'm not mistaken the pine source
code comes with a README file that will be of valuable assistance
if you decide to read it.

	Regards,

		Ed

    That is much too large a task to discuss briefly on this newsgroup. 
Please fetch the Pine distribution and read the documentation.

Subject: viewer-hdrs setting in .pinerc
Date: 2 Oct 1996 15:55:57 GMT
Message-Id: <52u3ad$fbv@netaxs.com>

This setting seems to ask for a list of the headers one wishes to see when
viewing messages.

Is there some way to set it to view *all* the headers, without listing
every conceivable one?  I tried "viewer-hdrs=all" and pine displayed no
headers at all - that was amusing.  The default "viewer-hdrs=" does not
show all the headers one sees by viewing the INBOX with other programs
(such as "more").

Thanks for any advice.

	Look in setup/config....

	Find:

	[X]  enable-full-header-cmd

	Read the Help on that command and see if it meets your needs.
With that command enabled you can hit "h" when vewing a message and
*all* the headers will appear.

The idea of "viewer-hdrs" is that you _explicitly_ list the headers you
want showing by default.

If you want to see _all_ of the headers of a message don't try and do it
by fiddling with "viewer-hdrs".  Instead enable the "full headers" command
in Pine's Setup Configuration screen and then give the "H" command when
viewing a message.

The change in the Setup Configuration screen remains in effect for future
Pine sessions.  The "H" command remains in effect (certainly for the
current folder, I can't remember if for subsequent folders) until you
leave Pine or toggle it off by another "H" command.

Cheers,

Even since Pine was updated (about a month or so ago at my site), I can no
longer create separate lists of addresses where I group addresses.  The
list options that was on the older version of Pine somehow is not there
anymore.  What happened and how do I create lists?  --Diana

I have a problem with incoming folders.

I am using procmail to sort incoming mail and I'm trying to use
'Incoming Message Folders' feature in Pine . I use 'A' to add a new folder,
pressing return on 'remote server' and stating a path to the
folder (ex. ~d92-msa/incoming-mail/abc_list). So far so good.
I can access all my messages but it's immpossible to use TAB to get 
to the next New message. What do I do wrong?

If this problem is solved will Pine alert me if on incoming mail in 
my extra folders?

thanks

Are there any plans to make Pine for Macintosh? 

I'm sure this is a common question, though, I haven't seen any info about
this anywhere. 

Thanks, Dara

Can someone please tell me if it is possible (and if so how in detailled 
description- step by step) if I can automatically bounce mail from a 
a particular address so I don't even ever see it in my inbox?  I'm using 
Pine 3.95 if that helps.

Please reply by email to  s441748@student.gu.edu.au
thanks

A checkpoint that takes 30 seconds is taking too long.  Rather than
increase the checkpoint interval, you would be better off fixing the
problem.

Unless your mailbox is truly enormous (say, bigger than 10 Mb) the
delay is probably caused by a mailbox that is NFS-mounted from another
machine.  This is definitely not a recommended configuration -- it will
certainly be slow; and file locking across NFS has timing problems that
increase the risk (admittedly small) of corrupting the contents of the
mailbox.

If your mailbox is really located on another host, the best solution is
to install an IMAP server on that machine and configure Pine to access
your mail via IMAP.  The Pine distribution includes such a server
(imapd) if you don't already have one.

But if you feel that you have no alternative but to increase the
checkpoint time, you can adjust that by redefining CHECK_POINT_TIME or
CHECK_POINT_FREQ and recompiling.  These symbols are defined in the
include file "pine/osdep/os-???.h" (where ??? is the appropriate code
for your operating system).

I'm using 3.95 and can't remember if 3.91 worked exactly the same, but assuming
it does...

In Pine on your other account, find the section under Config called
"customized-hdrs" and add the following:

	Bcc: maddox@mayo.edu

This will ensure that you get a Blind Carbon Copy (other recipients won't see
you as a recipient) of all outgoing messages from your other account.  If you
want to change this for a particular outgoing message, use CTRL-R (rich headers)
to view the Bcc field and change or delete the contents.  You can also add the
Bcc field to your "default-composer-hdrs" section so you'll see it each time.

In using PINE, how do I configure it such that when I respond to an
emailing, it does not ask me whether I want to be a sent a copy or 
not?

All the mail I send is being collected under "sent-mail", and so I 
don't want it to always ask me whether I wish to receive a copy of my 
response or not.  I have tried playing around with reconfiguring it . 
. . but to no avail.

Thanks a lot.  Looking forward to your response.

Yohaan John.

Global addressbooks are usually shared by several users.  Personal
addressbooks can also be shared by several users.  All you need to do
is have everyone specify the same file/path name and set the file
protections so that everyone has access to them.

Note that Pine does not implement a full multi-user locking mechanism
on addressbooks, so you could run into problems if you have several
people trying to simultaneously update the same addressbook...

In a related way, can someone help me with saving files to your own PC?  
When I log in to Telis, a menu comes up allowing me to choose Lynx or Pine 
mail.  After I get my mail, and then try to save an email message, it 
asks for my file name and/or path - everything I have tried has failed; I 
am assuming the files are being saved on my ISP, Telis.

Am I supposed to have my own copy of Pine, rather than just logging on to 
their version?  Or is there something in setup that I am missing?
If anyone can answer this I would really appreciate it.

We could tell you - but then we would have to kill you.

	As long as you've looked...that the most important thing.
Most of us have not see the forest because of the trees from time

	From your message header:

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.91........

	That your are running pine3.91 under Solaris.  (A U*IX OS).
In that case, you are correct.  The "save" command will cause the message
to be saved on the ISP's machine (a SUN).

	Please go to setup/config and learn about the:

upload-command           = <No Value Set>                             
upload-command-prefix    = <No Value Set>                            
download-command         = <No Value Set>                           
download-command-prefix  = <No Value Set>

	variables.  These will be the key to your uploading and
downloading the saved/exported messages to your PC.

	Regards,

		Ed

	You are using pine for Solaris.  My guess is that you are
using it over a dial-up link.  (I have to guess all of this since you
are not very descriptive....if you want quality "service" you have
have to give quality information.  :-) )  

	Are you have problems in other situations?  What other information
can you supply?

	I suspect that the problem lies in your communications
environment.  Comm SW configuration, modem settings, etc.  

	You should seek help from your local helpdesk staff on this
sort of problem.

	Regards,

		Ed

It comes with Pine.
You can get it at ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.gz

Just compile that, and Pico will be in there.

I have the same problem.  My solution is to:

1) save the message using (E)xport (I don't bother with view first)
2) download the file to my PC
3) use StuffIt Expander for Windows to decode the file (which for me is usually
   a Word for Macintosh document which I then open in Word for Windows)

(Send e-mail to "info@aladdinsys.com" with "winexpander" as the subject and no
message text and you'll get an automated blurb on StuffIt Expander.  It's FREE.)

In order to get around a firewall, I must telnet to my ISP and access
pine so as to read my mail. The firewall does not let mail through.
While, I could dial up the ISP, using our T1 is much quicker.  Is there
a Windows (Win95) program that can act as a graphical front end to pine?

By this I mean, a program that telnets to a pine session and then
fetches mail, and allows me to compose mail in the GUI environment? My
ISP does not give me unix shell access.

Thanks

	From your headers we have gleaned that you are using pine3.91.
(In any cry for help you should provide *much* more information about
your environment. *please*)

	I'd advise you to upgrade to pine3.95.  With pine3.95 you will
have additional capabilities.  Looking in the setup/config we find:

upload-command           = <No Value Set>                                       
upload-command-prefix    = <No Value Set>                                       
download-command         = <No Value Set>                                       
download-command-prefix  = <No Value Set>                                       

	which will make your life easier.  (IFF (meaning if-and-only-if)
you readin help menus associated with these commands  :-) )

	As for attaching files????  What seems to be the trouble?
If you put your cursor on the "Attchmnt" header and type ctrl-G (which
means "Get Help") do you find the documentation insufficient to 
perform this task?

	Regards,
		Ed

What mailers do you know of?  Every other UNIX mailer I know of and have
used (mail, mailx, Mail, elm) can do this by using it from the command line
or a shell script with redirected input.  Since pine does not accept
redirected input (its main shortcoming IMHO), it cannot.

Here is an example of a shell script that would also work from a ksh, sh, or
bash commandline:

#!/bin/sh

for f in `ls -1 /export/home` ; do
 mailx $f < file-to-mail
done

This would mail the contents of file-to-mail to every user who has a homedir
in /export/home, one at a time.

I have been trying for ages to create a filter for my forward file.
or figure out another way to accomplish this task...
I am going through an ISP who is offering me a virtual hosting system.
In turn, anything@alliedproductions.com  is funneled to one account.
I have been trying to make a filter to be able to make it so that if
it says a specific user@alliedproductions.com then it will be forwarded
to their email address...
an example of what I have tried:
if for: jan@alliedproductions.com then to: jan@anotherdomain.com
if for: dave@alliedproductions.com then to: dave@anotherdomain.com

none of which have worked... If you know the format for which this should
look, or have any information regarding this subject please send mail to:
darius@alliedproductions.com   or, post to this newsgroup...


thanks for your time....Michael Darius

Thanks for the reply!

I have already done what you suggested, but I did not have any success, 
probably because I don't know what to put in as the download command 
values; I tried local, and home and my local path, either c:\ or the 
current directory I am using (which is the comm program) I get a message 
saying I cannot use a colon, or it just doesn't work.  I thought it was a 
UNIX command I needed, but I looked through UNIX for dummies and couldn't 
find the answer.  I guess the question is too basic even for that book :)

I am setting up email and the Lynx browser for a friend of mine who is 
blind.  He needs to keep a DOS interface for his braille reader, and 
wants to download his messages so he can put them into his WordPerfect.  
I have tried downloading PINE and switching to it after I use the comm 
program to dial up and connect, but that didn't work either.  I really 
appreciate any help you can give me about this (I also tried the PINE 
mail newsgroup).

Kathleen

As far as I recall...

Originally there were no plans to do so.  However people kept asking and
the last I saw (quite a time back) was that it _may_ happen one day but
the stumbling blocks were staff time and finance.  I haven't heard
anything different; I don't think there's any active development going on
in this area.

That said, there's a very good IMAP mail client called "Mail Drop" for the
Apple Macintosh.  It's available free from: 

	ftp://ackmo.baylor.edu/pub/bell/Mail_Drop/

The current (3.95) version of Pine *does* accept redirected input.

I presume you're being asked whether or not you want a copy when you are
Replying to a message rather than when you start a new one?

If so, Pine is asking you this because it doesn't recognise your e-mail
address in amongst the addresses listed in the To: and Cc: fields.

For example, my e-mail address is "pmb1@york.ac.uk".  However a number of
other addresses also get to me.  Pine, however, only knows about the first
one.  So if one of my alternate addresses is used it doesn't recognise it
as being for me (thinking it is someone else instead it offers me the
choice of replying to it). 

To cure the problem you have to teach Pine what other addresses mail for
you might arrice as.  You do this in the Setup Configuration screen by
listing the alternative addresses as the value for the "alt-addresses"
variable.

Cheers,

  If your Shell account is on UNIX, try entering "sz filename" at the UNIX
prompt --- this command should start the transfer of the file from the
Shell account to your computer.
  Hope this helps.

	Well, your situation is best handled by your local helpdesk.
I say this since we are not aware of your environment.  We don't know
what comm SW you are using and we don't know what protocol you are using.
(xmodem, zmodem, kermit, etc)

	Sorry to leave you hanging in the wind....but if you describe
you enivrionment fully there are plenty of folks on this group with
experience in this area.  (Much more so than me...)

	Yes, pine can tell you.

	You need to do "Information Reasearch".

	From the m(ain) menu go to the a(ddressbook).  Whey you
get there type ?(help).  (Humm....wonder what that does????)
Do a bit of reading paying special attention to the section labeled
"Distribution Lists".  Sound familiar?

I really do want to upgrade my site to the latest, and this makes me want to
even more, but I get zero complaints/questions about 3.91, and I know I am
going to have questions when I do, and I do not have time to deal with them
right now.  Various things such as having to add patches that have not been
folded back into the base release to work around streams problems also make
me nervous.

trn respects the EDITOR environment variable, so you can set your editor

Hello,

I am on a Unix (Sun/Solaris) system, running X and CDE, if that
matters. I like Pine, but it has some problem : it seems to
believe I've got an US_ASCII display : it sometimes complains
about displaying ISO-8859-1 text on such a display. More over,
it refuses accentuated characters typed on the keyboard.
This looks abnormal : my others applications, even the shells,
accept accentuated characters under ISO-8859-1. There's
probably some misconfiguration somewhere, but I can't find where !?

Hi,

I have just installed pine 3.95 under AIX 4.1.4. Works fine. In some
text I have read on the possibility of using Pine to read mail on
another accounts than that I have started the program. How can I get the
mailbox on onother accounts?

    It means that the mail or news processing software at your site 
is enforcing a restriction which not all sites enforce.  (Mine, for
example, does not.)  That's why not everybody sees this error message.

    What you did, in all probability, is respond to an email or
newsgroup message.  When you replied, Pine "quoted" each line of the
original message with a less-than (>) sign to designate the original
material.  (There are ways of changing this quoting symbol,
incidentally.)  Then you added your reply.  However, the amount of your
reply was less than the amount of the original text.  Some mail agents
(or newsgroup posting agents, especially) do not permit this and refuse
your new message with the error indication you received above.  You
must redo things so that the amount of new material you add is greater
than the amount of quoted original material you are responding to. 
(I am unsure whether the criterion is line count or total character
count.)

    Even though it seems a little unfair, because some people are
subject to this restriction and some are not (depends on site policy),
it was instituted for a purpose.  How many times have we seen followup
postings on newsgroups which quote a 100-line original post in its
entirety only to add a 3-line reply at the very bottom?  It can be very
aggravating.  This restriction which you have run into forbids that
kind of nonsense.  It is not a restriction of Pine but of the software
which processes the mail or news once Pine has released it.

Date: 3 Oct 1996 12:58:50 GMT
Message-Id: <530daa$f94@newton.cc.rl.ac.uk>

I find that I can happily enter national
characters from pico 2.1 or 2.9 using
e.g. ALT-223 = ß

However, when using compose from pine 3.95 
it won't let me. (I get "unknown command").
I've looked through the setup options, and
the only thing I noticed vaguely relevant
(enable 8-bit esmpt transaction) didn't help.

I thought pine used pico as its composer editor,
so I find the difference strange. Does pine
call the external version of pico, or is the
equivalent pico code built into the pine module?
(I'm sure its the latter, so having an older version
of pico as default while using pine 3.95 should not
be the problem, or could it be?)

When I tried to add a new address, I received a message, "Address Book

"No writable address book." I had not experienced these problems until the
latest Pine update. Can someone help?

  Setting *both* of the above options works for me ...

Thank you so much Mike for addressing my problem.  I think you hit the 
nail on the head.  The only problem is that my PINE is 3.91 and I do not 
think that there is a choice of "alt-addresses" in SETUP-CONFIG.  At 
least I didn't find any.  My SETUP-CONFIG screen is this.  Do you know 
what I am supposed to do with PINE 3.91?

I am new to PINE and I was hoping someone could tell me exactly how I 
could accomplish the following:
I have an email address here and a different one on another campus. I 
read mail both places. I would like to configure PINE at my other 
address to automatically forward a copy of outgoing messages from 
there to my address here. That PINE is running on a VMS system, and 
the version number is 3.91 I believe. What exactly do I type between 
the quotation marks to accomplish this (presently no fcc is being 
used, and the null string "" is all that is there when I looked at the 
configuration program).
Thanks very much for the help.

Is there any simple way to transfer all of the files from an INTEL based 
UNIX operating system to a DOS/Windows operating system?  I know nothing 
about UNIX but I need to access the files on a UNIX machine.  Any help 
or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Message-Id: <01bbb14b$bc84bd60$1b0e8396@ufo.umt.edu>

We are having a considerable number of problems with Pine 3.93 and 3.95 on
DEC Unix 4.0 for users coming in on LAT lines.  SInce we upgraded to Pine
3.95, dial-up users (who come across LAT) and strainght LAT users have
reported that immediately after the main PNE menu appears on the screen,
their systems lock up and they have to basically crash out to regain
control of their PCs.  This of course leaves hung sessions on our UNIX box.

Is this PINE 3.93/3.94 problme wide-spread?  Any ideas on the cause?  A
fix?

Thanks....

I found the answer, indirectly, from an earlier posting

Go into "Setup",
Choose "Config"

Look for "Character-set"
Add new value: iso-8859-1

I believe this also answers David Monniau's question, which was

This does not answer the question:  old articles are available at
http://www.dejanews.com/

At many edu sites the default editor is vi (YUCHH!).  Most reasonable
software however checks the EDITOR environment variable.  Set that variable
to the editor of your choice and most real newsreaders will honor it.

No argument there!  But at many sites the person who maintains newsreaders
does not care about true threading (e.g. me), and does not have time to
maintain all the possible newsreaders.  At my site I only support nn (no
threads, but my newsreader of choice) and tin (threads, but a lot of user
interface deficiencies IMHO).

Wow it would be nice if this was better documented.

                                /* ftinode should be -1 if NFS */
  return ((!fstat (fd,&sbuf) && !ustat (sbuf.st_dev,&usbuf) &&
           !++usbuf.f_tinode) ||
          ((int) mail_parameters (NIL,GET_DISABLEFCNTLLOCK,NIL))) ? NIL :
            fcntl (fd,(operation & LOCK_NB) ? F_SETLK : F_SETLKW,&fl);


From "man ustat":

BUGS
     The NFS revision 2 protocol does not permit  the  number  of
     free  files to be provided to the client; thus, when ustat()
     is done on an NFS file system, f_tinode is always -1.

Since Solaris2.5 uses NFS V3 when it can, this test is nolonger valid.
However it concerns me that this locking is being ignored. Most vendors have
patches avaliable to fix some of the lockd/statd problems. The vendor
mailers (i.e. mailx) do not ignore these locks. Blind trust...

Subject: Compiling Pine for AIX 4.1


I'm having problems getting a successful compilation of Pine on an IBM RS/6000 
under AIX v4.1.

Some of the compile statements give the following kind of output:

        cc -g -Dunix=1 -D_BSD -DNFSKLUDGE  -c smtp.c

... and so on.

What's going on here?  If I un-tar the Pine 3.95 file and compile it on an AIX 
3.2.5 machine we've got, it installs just fine.  Am I missing something simple? 
Is it the environment or the "C" compiler that's having problems?

Any clues would be most appreciated.

I am a grad student at Gonzaga University in Spokane WA.  and have two 
email accounts.  One is on the university server and the other is with a 
commercial internet provider.  The commercial one is GUI where the 
university one is pine.  How can I forward my mail from the university 
mail account to the commercial server?

thanks,

Amazing.  It actually appears in someone's man page.  I had to determine
it by experimentation and reading kernel source code.

I heard that from SUN.  How SUN justifies returning "number of inodes"
over a protocol that is supposed to be OS-independent is beyond me.

However, SUN also claims that all the NFS locking bugs are fixed in
Solaris 2.5, so it doesn't matter that my test doesn't work (put another
way, the test does exactly the right thing, working only on systems where
NFS is broken).

That's SUN's claim, anyway.  I don't really believe it.  The entire design
of lockd/statd is bogus, and I doubt that it can ever be made to work.

The lock in question is not one that mailx would use.  This lock is the
private lock in the c-client library (called by Pine and imapd) that
guards against multiple Pines/imapds/etc. getting read/write access to the
same file at any one time.  As long as you use UNIX mbox format, it
doesn't matter that much if it fails.  The worst that will happen is that
if you run more than one Pine on the same mailbox, one of the Pines will
eventually cause the other to get an ACCESS ERROR.

If you use certain other formats (e.g. tenex format), it is a problem,
since these formats use random access and depend upon locking to work.
But we've always said, "don't use tenex format over NFS".

I have been using PC-Pine at home for over a year without problems. I dial
up to my school account and everything works fine. At my work, we finally
got a T1 line and I tried to access my mail box using PC-Pine 3.95 for Win95
(the same version as at home) but I never get a response from the IMAP
server. I can ping it just fine. I can also use Netscape, FTP and telnet
just fine. I know I can use telnet to acces my account but I like PC-Pine
better and would like to use it. Please help.

I'd like to report a bug/problem.

A user of pine3.95 reported that the screen didn't repaint when he tried
to compose a new message after being in the INBOX index screen and 
answering "no" to "Continue postponed composition". 

The user ended up with the "index" still on the screen and 
the mail headers were missing.

Below are sequences that the user typed. The user has a postponed new
message and several messages in INBOX, all were read.
 
        pine
        i               <- put in INBOX at last message
        p               <- back's up one
        c               <- prompts for create
        n               <- answer no to using postponed
        Screen will be messed up.

The user is running DECterm on a DEC3000 running OSF/1 Version 2.1. He
telneted to an AIX 4.1.4 to use pine3.95.

	Hummm......abandon pine???  Maybe you should ask your commercial
provider how to do it?  :-) :-)

	But if you really want to do it then you just have to add a
.forward file to your university account.  The contents of the
file are your address on the commercial side.

Hi guys.

I have a big trouble. My Pine-3.95 on RH linux (rembrandt) don't want to
send message Subject as 8bit plain text and does MIME encoding of Subject
before sending. When I do not set character-set=3D it does not allow me t=
o
type Russian characters at all in Subject field (says Unknown command). I=
f
I set character-set to KOI8-R pine sends subject like this:
	[KOI8-R] Test... ... ...
If I use russian characters in subject field pine converts them to MIME
encoded string and I can read this subject only on the same version of
Pine. Most users in our country use mail packages which allow to display
only 8bit plain text in Subject and message body. So how can I force Pine
to send Subject in 8bit plain text format?? And without -- [KOI8-R] at=20
begin of line??
	Please, reply to my E-mail address: alex@gil.kazan.su

Thank you in advance.

Yes ... upgrade to the current version of Pine (3.95).

It sounds like you are running on a UNIX box.  If you are using the right
shell (ksh, bash, tcsh zsh), then UNIX has the ability to pause the current
job, usually with a ^Z.  This has to be turned on in pine, either in the
system-wide pine.conf or in the users own setup.  When you get finished at
the UNIX prompt with whatever other jobs you are doing, you can type 'fg' to
get back to the background job.  If you forget the background job, or if you
have more than one, then you can see what jobs are in the bg by typing
'jobs'.  You can fg any job in the list by typing 'fg %n' where n is the
integer number returned by 'jobs'.

Back to the original Q, I am not sure recent versions of rzsz will accept
redirected input as the author CAF began altering the code in about 1988-9
to prevent that kind of usage.

If the text is onscreen, most terminal programs have a logging ability.

  Thanks a lot for this tip. I found that in this process(you
don't have to choose all messages in the folder), Pine
also applies 'display filter' and saves message(s) in local
code(code set converted by display filter), which is very nice
for Korean(and possiblely Japanese and Chinese as well) mail
which uses different charset/encoding(7bit ISO-2022-KR) from
local charset(8bit EUC-KR=KSC 5601)(For details, see RFC 1557).

We've got a seperate mail server running IMAP, and we use pine to get
our mail.  Well, this sucks because it takes almost 30 seconds to get
my login/password prompt.  WHY!!!!  Does it ALWAYS take this long, or
are we doing something wrong?  The machines are physically next to 
eachother, and we have twisted pair going right to it, and traceroute
yields a 2.0ns access time.  What's going on?  How do we fix it?

Please e-mail responses.

  If you have "snapshot" installed on your system, you can always recover
past files by going to the directory :

$HOME/.snapshot/ ...

  As a last resort, try to persuade your system administrator to recover
the lost files for you ...

  Hope this helps. :-)

I have a shell account and using pine 3.93.
I would like to know how to delete a posting that i have posted to a
forsale newsgroup?

I have seen this done a couple of times, But i forgot how to do this.
It has something to do with Control: in the subject header as I recall.

Thank You.

Hi , 
I am using 3.95 on a sun box, and i have my inbox on a remote machine.
occasionally when i login the status line which asks me for my inbox user name
and password doesnt repaint the screen properly and leaves some of the status
line blank.

The question i have is, is it possible at the beginning of a new month
for pine to auto prune folders and auto move the old ones so nothing 
is lost, and so that i dont have to go through with pine saying
delete this to save disk space?


Cheers Ian

How about replacing the current mail client with PINE?

PLEASE?!!!!!!!!!!

I just tried to upload a file using MIME and needless to say it fell over.
There can't be any reason not to have PINE, can there?

Hello.
Just a quick question about running pine on a MAC network. Printing from
pine works fine from the PowerMacs and the Mac IIci(s) but trying to
print from the Mac IIsi(s) causes a 'bomb' [error message: no FPU]. Does
the new version of pine require a FPU and if so, how can I get around this
problem without installing a FPU (emulated or otherwise).

thanks, rick...

If only the University of Minnesota (probably the largest college campus
in the US) would listen to that piece of advice were I to propose it.  :-)
I'll give it a shot though. 

Thanks a lot.

It is taking this long because Pine is attempting to establish a
"pre-authenticated IMAP connection" to your server in order to save you
having to type in your username and password.

The problem is that whoever set up the IMAP server software hasn't
installed the symbolic link (and perhaps changes to the rsh mechanism to
allow this).  Pine tries for a while, gives up, and falls back to asking
you for your username and password.

Two possible solutions:

1.  Get the IMAP server software installed properly to allow
pre-authenticated connections.  Doing so will save you and others from
having to enter their username and password each time they start Pine.

2.  Append ":143: to the hostname in the string specifying the IMAP server
in your Pine configuration file.  Do this by starting Pine and going to
its Setup Configuration screen.  Then look through all the settings and
look for those specifying your IMAP server.  Say these are to the machine
"imap.site.domain" ... they will currently look something like this:
	{imap.site.domain}INBOX
Change this to have ":143" at the end of the hostname:
	{imap.site.domain:143}INBOX

(Note: I am assuming that your IMAP server software is "talking" on the
standard IMAP port -- 143 -- if not then replace 143 with the appropriate
port number.)

Cheers,

If your ISP offers ELM's "filter" then look at my descriptions on this page:
	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/elm.filter.html

Add this rule to $HOME/.elm/filter-rules :
	if (from = address) then forward address.new

And if you want to keep a copy of it then use the action "forwardc", ie

It is a bit confusing.  How did you use Pine on a Mac?  Did you use
telnet to log into a Unix machine, and used Pine there?  Which telnet
software did you use?  NCSA Telnet?  Which version?  Which Unix did
you log into?  What version of Mac system did you use?  Is the printer
hooked to the Mac or the Unix?

What can I do to save my work when the line to the remote server breaks
down while I am composing a message? Postpone seems to need the server.

Thanks,

To remove this feature, unset the configurated value for the
read-message-folder.

I don't know whether it is possible to do this for values which are
set globally, though. (Changing the value is OK, but is removing it
altogether so?)

Mist,

Do you mean you want to add a header called "Newsgroups", as in
"Newsgroups: comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows, ..." ? If so, there is an
ExtraHeaders variable in the INI file; unfortunately, I don't think it
was available before Pro v2.2.

	Good luck,

    Since you are using an old verion of Pine, you will not be able to
use one of the nifty-swifty new features (Lcc:).

    Yes.  Enter the name of the list in the Bcc: field instead of the
To: field.  (Press Ctrl-R for Rich Headers if Bcc: is not visible.)  It
is very important that you put *something* in the To: field, or your
distribution will wind up being visible anyway.  Probably the simplest
thing to do is to put your own address in the To: field.  This way,
each recipient will only see his/her address.  (Recommendation: pester
your service provider into upgrading Pine to current level so you can
use the new Lcc: feature.)

    This one I do not know (but would like to know) myself.  Let's hope
one of the other fine people on this group will know.

I can.  Mine's set to 99.12 and I'm never bugged by those (to me)
annoying messages.  I think you can set it ahead farther than that, but
I seem to recall a reliable source posting to this group a while back that
Pine assumes we're in the 20th century; if you want to go beyond 1999, you
need to specify the century (e.g. - "2000.01" for January 2000).

i do not understand.  i have the same problem as others, that instead
of my name showing up in the newsgroup authors list, there is a
to:alt.astrology or to:starman or some such nonsense.  and it isnot
only from my list that it is not identified as my posting.  others
have also had problems finding my writings.  plus it appears that my
name isnot showing up when i reply to postings via email.  i am losing
patience with this, as i feel powerless.  what is the problem?  what
can i do to get my name to show up under the newsgroup authors list?

an interesting theory, adam, that this only happens within pine, but
others are not able to find my postings either.  i don't like this new
feature.  i need to be able to find my postings by my name and for
others to be able to find my postings by my name.  i post articles
that are of interest to others and they look for my articles by my
name.  this is important to me.  please tell me how to change this
posting name thing.

no it doesn't.

is there an option that changes this wonderful new feature to the old

	Close, to get to the year 2000 just add "1" to 1999.  

	i.e. 100=2000 so if you intend to use pine that long then
170 would bring you to 2070.  :-) :-)

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice on filtering lines in a
message header, specifically when posting a message to a newsgroup.

First a little background: I've got my computer set up so that the
newsgroups I read regularly get put into a number of ``category'' folders:
I've got one for programming, one for aus newsgroups, and so on. To
distinguish the original newsgroup, I've put a ``[-news.group.name-]'' tag
in front of the subject line.

It works really well. Until I come to reply to one of these messages and
forget to remove the [-...-] tag, and make myself look like a fool. Well,
more or less.

I can cope with mail messages, because I can (and have) changed
``sendmail'' to a batchfile.

One other thing, is there a particular reason why Pine ignores brackets
when sorting by Subject?

Thanx in advance,
aj

You should have ``formail'' if you also have procmail. formail lets you
split a mailbox up into the component messages and pass them through
another program.

Assuming you have procmail set up to handle new mail properly,

$ formail < /mail/mike -s procmail -d mike

ie ``run the command [procmail deliver to mike] for each message in
[/mail/mike]''

Sorry, but I can't help you on that one. Setting Pine's ``Sort order'' to
Date (as opposed to Arrival) gets most of it right, but odd date formats
still (used to? I upgraded to 3.95 yesterday. Maybe it works now) confuse
it.

Hope this helps,
aj

I recently upgraded our Pine from 3.91 to 3.95... the upgrade when quite
smoothly and happy with the new features.  Except that I broke something
for one of our users...  with 3.91, he was able to enter Chinese
double-byte characters, but with this version he is not able to.  I can't
seem to figure out how to enable this.  (3.91 came pre-compiled with
BSD/OS, so I don't know how that one was done.) 

Is this something that Pine itself supports, and can you help me fix it?

Thanks a lot.

Hello out there:
Suddenly my great email program seems to give me trouble. Without changing anything at the configuration the program
doesn't send email anymore. It gives me the following error message: 
-- [Mail not sent. Sending error: 451 queuename: Cannot create "qfMAA08204]
Does anybody has an idea what I could do about it?

I would appreciate your email!

My son is away at college.  He is receiving mail from me via the pine
program.  I have sent him some file attachments, but he says he does not
know how to open them.  I have never used Pine.  Can someone explain to me
so I can explain to him how to handle the attached files I sent him.  I am
using the Microsoft Explorer Mail Program.

	You are using pine3.95.  So, you are well on your way.  You
seem to work at Berkeley so with luck you won't mind a bit of
"Information Research"....

	From the m(ain) menu, type a(ddressbook).  Then type ?(help)
are read about the addressbook...which is really giving you a way
to do aliases.  Pay special attention to the section on "Distribution
List" which may come in handy when you want to sent to all 100 people
at the same time.

	Then, while composing a mail and with your cursor in the upper
portion of the screen type ^R(ich hdr).  Then put your cursor on the
Lcc: field and type ^G(help).

	Now, you should have the information you need....and you've
learned a bit more about the help features of pine.  This help feature is 
available without cost or obligation...and you don't have to be told
to use it in order for it to be of assistance.

	Regards,

		Ed

I have not had reason to try this, but I do have a suggestion. Compose a
message to yourself, with the file containing the addresses as an
'attachment'. Then, when the message arrives, use the viewer to 'view' the
attachment, which should look like the original list, and then use 'take
address' to get the addresses. The trick is to get that file into some
format that can be read by Pine.

Yours

Gregor

Q: How can I have my incoming mailing-list messages automatically put
   into appropriate folders?

This is one of the most frequently asked questions about email.  This
FAQ provides basic instructions for Unix users to set up either
procmail, mailagent, or elm's filter to filter incoming mailing-list
messages.  If you have a choice, I recommend procmail which is
powerful, robust, and is actively developed and supported.

All these mail processors can also be set up to filter other types of
incoming messages, send automated replies, etc.  For instructions see
the relevant references listed below.

Subject: 1.0 Mail Folder Strategies

It is a good idea to come up with a system for naming and reading
your mail folders.  With a good system, you will have an easier time
managing the hundreds (or thousands!) of messages you will receive.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     1.1 Naming Incoming Mail Folders

For my incoming mail folders I use names that start with `IN'.  For
example, I put mail sent to the procmail mailing list into a folder
named IN.procmail.  This way when all my folders are listed
alphabetically the incoming folders are together and near the top.
They are near the top because Unix is case sensitive and upper case
letters come before lower case letters in an ascii sort.

Of course, you can use any names you like for your mail folders!

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     1.2 Reading Incoming Mail Folders

Here are some instructions for opening a mail folder that's in the
default folder directory for some mailers and newsreaders.

         Default Folder  
 Reader   Directory      Command line command  From within reader
 ======  ==============  ====================  ==================
 elm     ~/Mail          elm -f =folder        c =folder
 pine    ~/mail          pine -if folder       G folder
 mail    ~/mail          mail -f /path/folder
 nn      ~/News          nn +folder            G +folder
 
(Please send me information for other mailers and newsreaders.)

Pine has an incoming-folder variable which you can use to list your
incoming folders in a separate section of your folder list (to view
your folder list in Pine, type `L').  Setting this variable also
allows you to use the Tab key to step through all new messages in all
your incoming folders.  For more information see the question "How
can I filter messages into different incoming folders?" in the Pine
FAQ:

  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/QandA/FAQs.html#xtocid178164


IMPORTANT NOTE 
============== 
If you are going to be editing your incoming mail folder, e.g.,
deleting messages, then your filtering program and your folder reader
should use locking schemes that work together.  Otherwise, if mail is
delivered at the same time that you are deleting a message your
folder may be corrupted.  To learn more about locking see the
question "What is folder locking and how does it work?" in the Pine
FAQ.  This is useful to read even if you don't use Pine as your
mailer.

 http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/QandA/sysadmins.html#xtocid7145

Most mailers, such as pine and elm, use lock a file named
`folder.lock' to lock the folder named `folder'.  Note that nn does
not lock folders so you probably don't want to use nn to delete
messages in a folder that is receiving incoming messages.  (Please
send me info about locking in other mailers and newsreaders.)

For more information about specific mailers and newsreaders, see the
relevant documentation, such as man pages and Web pages.  Some
pointers to documentation are listed in section 5.0.

Subject: 2.0 Procmail

Procmail is a powerful mail processor that can be used to process your
mail messages either as they arrive or after they are in a mail folder.  
To find out how to process an existing mail folder see the NOTES section
of the procmail(1) man page.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     2.1 Setting Up Procmail

To set up and test procmail, follow the ten steps given in sections
2.1.1 through 2.1.4 below.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.1.1 Is Procmail on Your System?

1]  To find out if procmail is on your system and what the full path to 
    it is, type one of the following commands:

      Shell      Command
      =====      =======
      csh        which procmail
      sh or ksh  type procmail
      various    whereis procmail
      various    where procmail

    Make a note of the full path to procmail because this is needed in
    step 5b below.  You can find out the version by typing:

      procmail -v

   The latest released version, as of 15 April 1995, is 3.10.
   Version 3.11 should be out soon.  If your system doesn't have
   procmail or doesn't have the latest version, you may want to ask
   your system administrator to install it.  The procmail package of
   tools is at:

 ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

   If your sys admin isn't able to do this, use a different mail
   processor like mailagent (described in section 3 of this FAQ) or
   filter (described in section 4).

Subject:         2.1.2 Setting Up Procmail for Testing

2a] Create ~/.procmailrc.  

     cd
     pico .procmailrc

    NOTE: Throughout this article I use pico for editing files.
          Replace `pico' with your editor.

2b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.procmailrc.
    Note that lines that begin with # are comments and are ignored by
    procmail.

     #Set on when debugging
     VERBOSE=off
 
     #Replace `mail' with your mail directory (Pine uses mail, Elm uses Mail)
     MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
     
     #Directory for storing procmail log and rc files
     PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
     
     LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.testing
     INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.maillists

3] Create the directory where you will store your procmail log and rc files 
   (this is $PMDIR that you set above).

     cd
     mkdir .procmail


4a] Create an rc (run commands) file for testing:

     cd .procmail
     pico rc.testing


4b] Enter the following in ~/.procmail/rc.testing:

      :0:
      * ^Subject:.*test
      IN.testing

    Note that the first line contains a zero (0), not the letter "oh".
    For now, don't worry about the meaning of this recipe.  It is
    explained in 2.3 "Explanation of Test Recipe."


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

     cd
     pico -w .forward



5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #nancym"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include all the quotes, both double (") and single (').
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for procmail (see step 1).
    * Replace `nancym' with your userid.  You need to put your userid in 
      your .forward so that it will be different than any other .forward file 
      on your system.
   
    * Do NOT use ~ or environment variables, like $HOME, in your .forward
      file.  If procmail resides below your home directory write out the 
      *full* path.


5c] On many systems you need to make your .forward world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.1.3 Testing

6] Send yourself two test messages: one with `test' in the subject
   and one without `test' in the subject.


7] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
   were delivered correctly.  The one with `test' in the subject
   should be in the folder $MAILDIR/IN.testing and the one without 
   `test' in the subject should be in your inbox.  

   If these were not delivered correctly, see section 2.2 on
   "Troubleshooting Procmail" section below.

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.1.4 Setting Up Procmail to Filter Mailing List Messages

8a] Once you have successfully tested procmail in steps 6 and 7, create 
     rc.maillists for filtering incoming mailing-list messages into mail 
     folders.
  
      cd
      cd .procmail
      pico rc.maillists


8b] In rc.maillists, create a recipe, like the two example recipes
    below, for each of your mailing lists.

     :0:
     * ^TOwww-talk
     IN.www-talk

     :0:
     * ^TOprocmail
     IN.procmail
     
     The first recipe filters the www-talk mailing list and the second 
     recipe filters the procmail mailing lists.  The meaning of the first 
     recipe is as follows:

     Notation      Meaning
     ========      =======
     :0            Begin a recipe
       :           Use a lock file
     *             Begin a condition 
       ^TO         Match ``To:'' ``Cc:'' or other synonyms for To at the
                   beginning of a line, followed by any or no characters,
                   followed by....
          www-talk  ``www-talk''
     IN.www-talk   If successful match, put in folder $MAILDIR/IN.www-talk

  
     IMPORTANT NOTES
     ===============
     * ^TO is not a normal regular expression; it is a special
       procmail expression that is designed to catch any destination
       specification.  For details, see the MISCELLANEOUS section of
       the procmailrc(5) man pages.

     * Do not put a space between the caret (^) and the word `TO' in
       `^TO'.

     * Do not put a space between the `^TO' and the text that you are
       matching on; it must be `^TOtext'.

     * Both letters in `TO' must be capitalized.
       

9]  Repeat steps 6 and 7 to make sure that things are still working.


10]  Comment out the rc.testing line in you .procmailrc file so that it looks 
     like this:
          
       VERBOSE=off
       MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
       PMDIR=$HOME/.procmail
       LOGFILE=$PMDIR/log
       # INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.testing
       INCLUDERC=$PMDIR/rc.maillists

     NOTE: Leaving the rc.testing line in your .procmailrc file is
           useful for future testing.

Subject:     2.2 Troubleshooting Procmail

If messages are not delivered correctly, here are steps you can use to
try to solve the problem.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:         2.2.1 General Strategies

1]    Look at your $LOGFILE (~/.procmail/log) to see if you can
      determine what the problem is.

2]    Check these three files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.procmailrc
        ~/.procmail/rc.testing

3]    Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c in "Setting up Procmail for Testing" above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x are
                       each acceptable.)
      

4]    If the above three steps do not locate the problem edit your 
      ~/.procmailrc so that it contains:

        VERBOSE=on

      Test procmail by following steps 6 and 7 again.  Look at your
      $LOGFILE (which will contain verbose messages) to see if you
      can now determine what the problem is.

      If you are still having problems see the next section on
      "Alternate .forward Files."  After you get procmail to work, 
      you probably will want to set VERBOSE back to off.

------------------------------

From: "Stephen R. van den Berg" <berg@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Subject:         2.2.2 Alternate .forward files

If the .forward template in 5b above doesn't work the following alternatives 
might be helpful:

In a perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In an almost perfect world:
	"|exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In another world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"
In a different world:
	"|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=nancym"
In a smrsh world:
	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail #nancym"

These formats can be tried in different combinations, the leading "| can
be tried as |" instead, or vice versa.

NOTE
====
If your system uses procmail as its local delivery agent, you do not
need a .forward file; simply having a .procmailrc files suffices.  To
find out if procmail is the local delivery agent, ask your system
administrator.

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     2.4 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

You can use mailstat, a useful script that is part of the procmail
package, to check your procmail log file. Check to see if it is 
on your system by typing either `which mailstat' or `type mailstat'.  
If it's on your system type:

  mailstat $HOME/.procmail/log

This displays a concise version of your log file and moves your log 
file to log.old.  You may want to put the above line in your .login so that 
each time you log in you will see a listing of how many messages you've
received since the last time you ran mailstat, and what folders these
messages were delivered to.

You can get a mailstat listing of log.old by using the -o flag:

  mailstat -o $HOME/.procmail/log


If mailstat is not on your system ask your system administrator to
install it.  The script is located with all the other procmail tools
(see 2.1.1 above for the ftp location).

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject: 3.0 Mailagent

Mailagent is a powerful mail processing package that can be used to
process your mail messages, either at arrival time via a .forward hook
or later on while they are already saved in a mail folder.

Mailagent is written in Perl and hence has all the advantages of being
interpreted, i.e. it is easy to enhance dynamically and to customize.

This version of the FAQ describes the basics of setting up mailagent to
process incoming mail messages from within a .forward. To find out about
the more advanced features of mailagent, please refer to the mailagent(1)
manual page.

------------------------------

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.1 Setting Up Mailagent

1] First, make sure mailagent is available on your system. The easiest
   way to do this is to run:

    mailagent -V

   which will print the mailagent version if it is available, or the shell
   will issue an error message "mailagent: not found" or something like it.

2a] Now you need to understand the MTA (Mail Transport Agent, the program
    that delivers the mail; usually, sendmail) will NOT deliver to mailagent
    directly, rather to an intermediate (small) filter program. Two versions
    are available: shell or C -- refer to the mailagent(1) manpage to choose,
    but I recommend you use the C version first, and move to the shell
    version if you can't run a binary from your .forward file.

2b] Locate the filter program (it will be filter or filter.sh depending on
    whether you choose the C or the shell version respectively) under some
    directory like /usr/local/lib/mailagent. From now on, we'll assume we
    use the C filter and that it is located under /usr/local/lib/mailagent.

3] Copy the file /usr/local/lib/mailagent/mailagent.cf as ~/.mailagent and
   edit it to configure your system correctly. You will see two distinct
   sections in that file and you need to set-up properly the first one, the
   "Configuration section".

   If you have a version of mailagent that is recent enough (at least 3.0 PL32)
   then you can create an initial configuration very easily and quickly by
   running the following command:

    mailagent -I

   which will set-up an almost ready-to-use ~/.mailagent file. All you
   need to do at this point is go through its configuration section
   to make sure mailagent made the right choices...

   The minimal set of variables that MUST be correctly set (i.e. for which
   you cannot rely on the default set in the file) are (# introduces comment
   in a shell-like manner, which run up to the end of the line):

    home:  # Your HOME directory, as reported by "echo $HOME", usually.
    path:  # Path to be used to locate mailagent and perl, at least.
    p_xxx: # Path to be appended to "path" above when running on machine "xxx".
    user:  # Your login name.
    name:  # Your name.
    level: # Logging level. I recommend you raise it to 20 for testing.

   The mail folder directory is ~/Mail by default, but it can be changed
   only from within your rule file by putting

    maildir = ~/mail;

   at its top, for instance, to make it ~/mail. The rule file is defined as
   the "rules" parameter, and is set to ~/.rules by default.

4] Ensure the directories configured in your ~/.mailagent under "logdir" and
   "spool" and "queue" do exist. If you use the standard setting, this
   requires the following commands:

    cd
    mkdir var
    cd var
    mkdir log mailagent
    cd mailagent
    mkdir queue

5a] Create a rule file (named ~/.rules by default) for testing:

    cd
    vi .rules

5b] Enter the following in ~/.rules

    Subject: /test/     { SAVE testing };

    The meaning of that rule should be pretty obvious: If we receive a mail
    whose subject line contains the word "test", then we save that mail in
    a folder named "testing", under the default folder directory (~/Mail).

5c] Create a ~/.forward file as follows:

    "|exec /usr/local/lib/mailagent/filter >> /export/home/ram/.bak 2>&1"

    The meaning of that line is the following: every mail should be piped
    (hence the leading "|" character) onto the filter program, and any
    output from that program (i.e. errors) are appended to some file in
    your home directory, with stderr following stdout (2>&1) in traditional
    sh syntax.

    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Your .forward is always processed by sh, regardless of your login shell.
    * Replace /export/home/ram with your proper login directory full path.
      That's a part that makes your .forward unique (for zealous optimizing
      sendmail that are dead wrong about optimizing!) and that can save
      you a lot of trouble if anything goes wrong! Just look at your ~/.bak!
    * Replace /usr/local/lib/mailagent/filter with the proper filter path
      on your machine.

5d] Note that on many systems, you need to ensure your .forward will be
    readable by everybody, and that your home directory has the "x" bit set
    for everybody (i.e. can be part of a lookup path) so that sendmail can see
    and parse your .forward file. To ensure this, type:

        cd
        chmod a+r .forward
        chmod a+x .

6] Send yourself two test messages: one with "test" in the subject, and one
   without "test" in the subject.

7a] Checkout your ~/.bak file: it should be empty!

7b] Checkout your ~/var/log/agentlog file to see what really happened to your
    messages. Watch out for any ERROR or WARNING logs. This assumes you have
    left at least the default logging level (9) in the ~/.mailagent file (the
    "level" variable). But for testing, that level should be raised to 20 to
    help you diagnose what's going on.

7c] Look out in ~/Mail/testing. You should find there the message whose Subject
    line contained the word "test". Then make sure the other message has been
    delivered to your regular mailbox. (Since no match occurred in your rule
    file, the mail is left in your mailbox by default).

7d] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If your mail was not properly delivered, please make sure your rule file
      and configuration file are correct by issuing the following command:

        mailagent -d

    * If the previous command does not output the single rule you should have
      put in ~/.rules, then please make sure step 3 and 4 above were correctly
      performed (those being the crucial steps ensuring a proper configuration).
    
    * Check the ~/.bak file for error messages.

    * Check for typos in any of these files:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.mailagent
        ~/.rules
    
    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in step
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      
    * If none of the previous hints helped you identify problem, and you can't
      figure it out from the output in ~/.bak or in the ~/var/log/agentlog file
      (or whatever file you have configured for logging within your ~/.mailagent
      file, variables "log" and "logdir"), then make sure your mail is not
      waiting in the MTA's queue: this might be the case if the agentlog file
      is empty. If you are using sendmail as MTA, you can run:

        /usr/lib/sendmail -bp
    
      to print out the queue.
    
    * As a last resort, please look at the mailagent(1) manual page under
      the section "Testing Your Installation" for more tips and things
      to look at.

8] Once you have successfully tested mailagent in steps 6 and 7 above,
   you're on! Mailagent is ready to process your mail. All you have to
   do is extend the ~/.rules file to add more rules.

   For instance:

   To Cc: www-talk      { SAVE www-talk };
   To Cc: agent-users   { SAVE agent-users };

   Those two rules filter the two mailing lists www-talk and agent-users into
   their respective folders, whether the mailing list address appear in the To
   OR Cc header.

   Since rules are not qualified as a pattern match (contrary to our test
   above), they match on logins in the address, i.e. they will match things
   like www-talk@chip.com or chip!www-talk, or a plain simple www-talk if
   this is a local alias. (This implicit matching on logins works only for
   some selectors like To, Cc or From which are know to contain addresses).

   If you wish to sort on patterns appearing in the Subject of messages for
   instance, then you must use a pattern matching syntax, as in:

   Subject: /star trek/ { SAVE star-trek; };

   to save in a folder "star-trek" all the messages whose subject contains
   the words "star trek". Case matters, but keep on reading...

9] As an advanced topic, since mailagent is written in Perl, you have all the
   power of Perl's regular expressions at your disposal. Which means you can
   write things like this:

   To Cc: agent-users                    { REJECT AGENT };
   <AGENT> Subject: /^\w*subscribe/i     { DELETE };
   <AGENT> *                             { UNIQUE -a; SAVE agent };

   The second lines makes use of that perl extended regular expression syntax:
   \w matches an alphanumeric character plus "_", while the trailing "i" option
   requests a case-insensitive match.

   You also note you have a real automaton at your disposal. You can enter
   a special state (AGENT in our example) and continue parsing by only
   scanning for rules tagged by this mode. The first match stops the automaton,
   unless you REJECT to continue processing. When not restricted by a mode list,
   a rule is always taken into account. For example, assuming the automaton
   is in the state "NEWS", it will not consider rules tagged <AGENT>, as in
   the above example. The automaton begins in mode "INITIAL".

   The "UNIQUE -a" action followed by a SAVE ensures only one copy per
   Message-ID will ever end-up in your agent folder -- no duplicates!
   Also note you can have more than one action per rule, and that the last
   one uses '*' to match anything, i.e. its action part between {} will
   always be executed in AGENT mode, when reached by the automaton.

   Also, since in Perl regular expression syntax, \b matches a word-boundary
   and \s any space or tab character, we can write our Star Trek message
   sorting into a much more robust form:

   Subject: /\bstar\s+trek\b/i  { SAVE star-trek; };

   (\s+ matches one or more white spaces, while \s* would match zero or more,
   see the Perl manual page for a complete description of regular expressions.)

   which will match on various subject strings like "Last Star Trek season"
   or "I am addicted to Star trek", but not on "Tristar treks" -- whatever
   that means :-)

   All in all, the filtering automaton syntax is pretty much intuitive and
   easy to read. You have to learn which actions are possible and what they
   mean, naturally.

Subject:     3.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail

If you are curious about what mailagent does to your mail, you have two
options:

    * Look at your "agentlog" file, with a log level set to 9.
    * Get a summary of all the actions performed by running:

        mailagent -summary

      This last option is only possible if you have initialized the statistics
      gathering process by creating a ~/var/mailagent/mailagent.st file (under
      the default setting from ~/.mailagent).

      You will get a clear picture of your processing, by seeing which rule
      match, how often, in which state, etc... You will also know how many
      times you SAVE or DELETE messages for instance.

      Actually, mailagent statistics are triggered by a simple

        mailagent -s
    
      command, the letters given after in the {u,m,a,r,y} set being options
      that alter the output given by the command.

    * Look at the ~/.bak occasionally to make sure no error is pending...

------------------------------

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.3 How Safe Mailagent Processing Is?

As soon as the filter program has taken a hold on your message, you can rest
assured the mail will get filtered one way or the other. If filter can't
queue your mail, it will exit with an exit status of 75, that status
being recognized by "sendmail" as a "deliver later on" hint, in which case
the mail message will safely wait in sendmail's queue.

So if filter gets your message, it immediately forks and exits with a 0
status for sendmail, letting it know its work is finished and releasing it
to save resources. It then calls mailagent on the queued message (in mailagent's
private queue) to actually process the message.

Only after successful processing will mailagent delete the queued message.
Hence, under an heavily loaded system, the worst that could happen would be
a duplicate processing of a message, or a bounce back when sendmail cannot
fork and exec the filter program from your .forward.

Under catastrophic conditions, filter or mailagent will simply dump the message
on stdout, for ~/.bak to catch, preceded by the reason why processing was
aborted.

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.4 Locking Under Mailagent

By default, mailagent proceeds with a fixed locking scheme (.lock extension)
plus flock() if asked to do so at Configure time. However, mailagent provides
support for NFS-secure locks and also can use non-standard locking procedures,
configurable from within ~/.mailagent (variables "nfslock" and "mboxlock").

However, it cannot support locking on a rule basis (yet!). The author is
willing to raise the priority of that item if one comes up with a legitimate
need for that feature that could not be worked-around by a PERL escape. ;-)

------------------------------

From: Raphael Manfredi <ram@hptnos02.grenoble.hp.com>
Subject:     3.5 Folder Types Supported

Mailagent can deliver mail to plain UNIX folders (also known as "mbox format"),
to MMDF folders, to MH folders (with unseen sequence update built-in and using
locks, not like rcvstore which does not!) or to directories (ala MH, but
without unseen sequence support and with alternate naming possible).

It also supports delivery to folders with the "x" bit set, in which case
mailagent interprets those as being hooks. It either pipes the message
to the "program" or further interprets the hook to do more processing.
See the manual page mailagent(1) under the section "MAIL HOOKS" for more
details.

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject: 4.0 Filter

Filter is part of the Elm package of tools.  Note that you can use filter
to filter your incoming mail even if you are not using Elm to read your mail.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
If your system has both procmail and filter installed then you should use 
procmail which is *much* more robust and powerful than filter.  This 
recommendation is almost universal; even the developers of Elm and Filter
recommend procmail over filter.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MAIL MESSAGES
WHEN USING FILTER; this is rare but it has happened.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     4.1 Setting up Filter
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

1] Find out if filter is on your system and what the full path to it is.  
   If you are using the C shell (csh) type:

     which filter

   Or, if you are using the Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne shell (sh) type:

     type filter

   If neither ``which'' nor ``type'' are on your system try ``where'' and
   ``whereis''.  If your system doesn't have filter ask your system 
   administrator to install it; or even better ask her to install procmail.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3a] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules.  (Note that throughout this article I use
    pico for editing files.  Replace ``pico'' with your editor.)

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules

  
3b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules

     if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Berkeley Mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses 
   /Mail (upper case M).
   

4] To see what the filter rule will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


5a] Create a ~/.forward file by typing the following. (Pico's -w flag tells 
    pico not to auto wrap lines.)

      cd
      pico -w .forward


5b] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:


     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"


    == IMPORTANT NOTES ==
    * Make sure you include the quotes (").
    * The vertical bar (|) is a pipe.
    * Replace /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1).
    * Replace /j/nancym with your home directory (see step 2).
   
    * Do NOT expect environment variables, like $HOME, to work in your 
      .forward file.
    * Do NOT expect ~ to mean your home directory in the .forward file.


5c] Note that on many systems you need to make your .forward is world 
    readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
    mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
      cd
      chmod 644 .forward
      chmod a+x .


6] Send yourself two test messages: one with ``test'' in the subject
   and one without ``test'' in the subject.


7a] Start your mailer (pine, elm, etc.) and check that the messages
    were delivered correctly.  The one with ``test'' in the subject
    should be in the folder IN.testing and the one without ``test'' 
    in the subject should be in your inbox.  If these were delivered 
    correctly go on to step 8.


7b] TROUBLESHOOTING
    * If the two messages were not delivered correctly look at your
      ~/.elm/filter-errors to see if you can determine what the problem 
      is.  

    * Check these two files for typos:
        ~/.forward
        ~/.elm/filter-rules

    * Check the file and directory permissions of your .forward (set in 
      5c above).

      Type...          In order to...
      -------          --------------
      cd               Go to your home directory.
      
      ls -l .forward   Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--
      
      ls -ld .         Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                       The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                       drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).
      

    * If none of these turn up the problem edit your ~/.forward so
      that filter will be verbose with it's output (use the -vo flag).

        "|/usr/local/bin/filter -vo /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

      And repeat steps 6 and 7.  After you get filter to work you 
      will probably want to change the ``-vo'' flag back to ``-o''.

   
8]  After you have successfully tested filter in steps 6 and 7, edit
    ~/.elm/filter-rules so that it contains a modified version of the
    following:

     # if (subject contains "test") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.testing"
     if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
     if (to contains "hopos-l") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.hopos"

     Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path and
     /Mail with the name of your mail directory.  Replace the mailing 
     list string (e.g., "www-talk") and the name of the mail folder
     (e.g., IN.www-talk) with text for your mailing lists.

     Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...

     Rather than deleting the test line, it's useful to just turn it
     into a comment (by preceding it with #) so that you can easily
     use it for future testing.

------------------------------

From: FAQ Editor <faq-editor@ii.com>
Subject:     4.2 Tracking Your Incoming Mail
Followup-To: comp.mail.elm

You can get a short summary of filter's activity by typing:

    filter -s

For a longer summary type:

    filter -S

Or you can look at the log file itself, ~/.elm/filterlog.

You should regularly look at ~/.elm/filter-errors to make sure things 
are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
log in by putting the following in your .login:

    tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
they don't fill up your disk space.  To get a summary of the filter log and 
clear it type:

    filter -cs

i'm very happy now that i got Pine 3.95 (bsd) mail going with a popclient
- my Isp isn't up to playing around with Imapd.

so now - my question is - what can i do about Newsgroups?
i've tried a zillion different config options, but i can't
get my nntp.isp.net to work very well with pine.

i can't get a NEWSRC file set up on my PC, after 3 hours it pops up on my 
screen, but i can't save it.  i tried many differnt news-collection
paths.  i think i need a popclient for nntp or something ... i don't know.

Subject: "Move read messages?" prompt
Message-Id: <DyoCn3.Inw@world.std.com>
Date: Thu, 3 Oct 1996 00:42:39 GMT

I've pored over all the Pine documentation I could find and skimmed both 
the current newsspool and the mailing list archives, looking for an answer
to the question I'm about to ask.  If it's an exasperatingly common one, I 
apologize for wasting your time.

Whenever I quit Pine with messages still in my inbox, I receive the prompt
asking, "Move messages to "read-messages"?"  Now I know how to configure 
Pine to move the messages without prompting; I also know how to configure 
Pine to move the messages to the folder of my choice rather than the 
default.  What I haven't been able to figure out is how to configure Pine 
either to quit prompting me altogether, or to offer the prompt with a 
default reply "no" (so I could just <Enter> through it without affecting 
my mail).

I've been a contented Pine 3.91 (Unix) user, and I just moved to a new
shell account which has 3.93.  There's nothing in my provider's pine.conf 
file that would explain it, and they don't have a pine.conf.fixed.  I 
understand they might have a vested interest in my keeping my mail in my
allotted disk space rather than their mailspool, but as far as I can tell
they're not doing this.

Is there any simple way to accomplish what I'm looking for?

I am also trying to learn how to download my mail from PINE mail.
If I click on export, it does not allow me to save it to my hard drive.  
If I go to setup, config, and enter, local instead of remote, it doesn't 
work.  The host computer (UNIX) only sees my DOS computer as an extension 
of itself.  I am trying to help a blind man who uses a braille reader and 
needs DOS.  Our ISP only has windows support, although we can log in with 
DOS (Procomm).  I looked in UNIX for Dummies but I still don't get it.

Can someone tell me what to type in the config setup to allow 
downloading/saving to my own computer?

	Well, at least you tried, right?  

> Is there any simple way to accomplish what I'm looking for?

	I'd have to check back and find if 3.93 had these features.
If 3.93 doesn't have these then you will find yourself needing to
upgrade to 3.95.  (I'm fairly certain they were in 3.93...)

	Anyway, looking at the pine config/setup menu we find:

         OPTION: Read-Message-Folder
 
By virtue of specifying a folder name here, Pine will be configured to
save all messages which you have read during a session into the designated
"read messages" folder.  This allows you to more easily distinguish
between your really new email (in your INBOX) and those which you have
already read.  Depending on how you define the "auto-move-read-messages"
setting in the "feature-list", you may or may not be asked when you quit
Pine if you want read messages to be moved to this folder.  In either
case, moving the messages means they will be deleted from your INBOX.
 
If this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for
saves.  Any valid folder specification, local or remote (via IMAP), is
allowed.  There is no default for the name of the read message folder.

	Then we also find:

        FEATURE: auto-move-read-msgs
 
This feature controls an aspect of Pine's behavior upon quitting.  If set,
and the "read-message-folder" variable is also set, then Pine will
automatically transfer all read messages to the designated folder and mark
them as deleted in the INBOX.  Messages in the INBOX marked with an "N"
(meaning New, or unseen) are not affected.
 

	FYI, I have both of these unset and never get a prompt.  This was
one of the options you indicated would be OK, right?

	Regards,

		Ed

Subject: distribution lists
Date: 29 Sep 1996 02:24:59 GMT
Message-Id: <52kmlr$kn2@hume.nmia.com>

I have been using Pine 3.91 for awhile but I am not very familiar with the 
use of the address book.  I've figured out how to make a distribution list 
within ADDRESS BOOK, and to use the name of the distribution list in 
COMPOSE MESSAGE to send a message to all within the list.  But ...

  (1) is there a way to send to (all members within) a distribution list 
without Pine printing out all of the member names into the header area? 
(I'd rather not have everyone in the group know who is in the group)
I have seen this work for some mail tools on VMS systems ...  I am currently using a UNIX system ... and Pine?

  (2) if you have a file in your directory that is a listing of e-mail 
addresses, is there a way to tell pine to use that (file) without having to 
enter all those addresses into an ADDRESS BOOK distribution list?
 
TIA

Sue Foltz

Sorry to burst the bubble!  Pine 3.95 can do it.  I am not sure about 
other versions except 3.91 cannot do it.

First, create a list/group in the address book.  E.g., I created a group,
vol, for my volunteers.

Second, in Pine, do a "c" to start the composing page.  While the cursor
is still in one of the header lines, do a "^R" to get the "rich header"
mode.  Skip the "To:" line.  Go to the "Lcc:" line and enter the list/
group name (e.g. vol, see above).  After this is entered, the "To:" line
will be automatically filled by Pine.  Pine 3.91 does not have "Lcc:" 
line in rich header mode, so you may not be able to do this trick.

Third, the rest of mail composing is done normally.

Our system recently upgraded pine (as the title would imply) - now when
I "reply to all" pine includes myself in the carbon copy.  This is
rather annoying, different than 3.91.  Is there a way to disable this?

Our provider is Telis, the California State Telemation Project; it is the 
only provider for our rural mountain area that is not long distance.  
However, they do not offer any DOS support, only Windows.  I have tried, 
and so have they, but there doesn't seem to be anyone there that 
understands this problem.  When I dial in with Procomm, I choose VT100 or 
telnet connection.  Either one gives us the Lynx or PINE choice and 
that's all.

I see other postings related to this, but I have not been able to find 
any answers so far here, or at the PINE site in Kansas.  Can part of the 
problem be the version is 3.91?  The variables Ed mentioned for 
upload/download are not available in my config screen.
Don't students use their own computers at Universities and run into this 
problem?

    I use an alternate editor (JOE) with Pine 3.94 and have no problems. 
However, I do have enable-alternate-editor-cmd set as well as the other
two.  Based on what I read in the help screens, this should really not
make a difference, but it certainly doesn't seem to hurt.  Also, it is
possible for an installation to set defaults that the user cannot
override.  I don't know that that is your case, but you could look. 
(Without checking, I think the file is named something like
.pine-conf-fixed .)  But it doesn't make much sense for an installation
to allow a user to invoke an alternate editor by command but not by
default.

Hi.
My name is kanghee Lee from University of Colorado at Boulder and I am
just starting using e-mailing.
How's the weather up there?
The weather of here, Boulder, CO, is very nice.  It's like typical fall.
Today, I just got a mail that i have attempted sending chain letter.
Unfortunatly, I completely have no idea about that.  If I had done
something illegal, probably I shouldn't have known about that, so I am
sending a question that what the chain letter is and the other sfuff
related to chain letter.
If you reply to my question, I'll be really appreciated. I'll be looking
forward your mail.  Thank you.

    One thing you need to be aware of is that, as such, the computer
running Un*x and the PC are completely independent machines which
happen to be connected to each other with a communications link of some
kind and both of which have software programs at eash end of that link
which can talk to each other, providing the interfaces to each machine.

    Now Pine, running on the Un*x machine, knows nothing about your PC. 
It has never heard about such an animal.  However, there are ways for
programs on the Un*x box to talk to similar programs on the PC box via
the communications interface in order to get a file from Un*x to PC,
and fortunately there are ways for Pine to talk to those other
programs, thus closing the loop.  Unfortunately, it is not always
immediately obvious, and depending on the version of Pine, you may
well not be able to use the Export command.

    You did not provide which version of Pine is running on the Un*x
machine.  That information is very important.  I do not recall when the
new feature came in, but I know it is present in at least 3.94, which I
am using.  There is a direct interface between Pine's Export command
and a program, such as zmodem, xmodem, or kermit, which can do the real
downloading to the PC.  Of course, you must have a compatible program
running simultantously on the PC.  Commonly, it is built in to the PC
communications software.  If your version is Pine is current, or nearly
so, go into Setup and Config and scroll down to the 'download-command'
section (or some similar name) and read the online help files.

    If your version of Pine is older, you can still transmit files
directly from Pine.  In the configuration, enable the Un*x pipe
command.  Take this shell script:

#!/bin/sh
umask 066
trap "rm -f $HOME/tmp/$$download" 0
cat > $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
sz -a $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
rm -f $HOME/tmp/download.$$$
umask 077

and put it in some directory in the PATH.  Mark it executable.  Then,
when you want to download a message from Pine, just enter the pipe
symbol (|) and answer the prompt with 'sendz'.  (This assumes that
zmodem is on the PC and can be automatically invoked.  Otherwise you
might have to adjust the script some.)  Be aware that this script
creates a file on the PC with name 'download.nnn' where 'nnn' is the
first three digits of the Un*x process number.  You might want to shell
out to the PC and rename the file if you are going to download several
in quick sequence.

    If this seems a little complicated, well, unfortunately not every
single task we sometimes want to do in life is transparently easy.

     I know, another filtering question. :(  In my defense, I have looked
at all the archives and procmail examples I could find before finally
asking here.

     Now with that out of the way...Is there any way to take one huge email
box and split it into various folders?  I've managed to get procmail going
just fine with new mail, but this old stuff just hangs out in one big blob.

     Also, since the folders already contain new email, is there a way to have
it arrange them in the right date order?  (Thought I'd ask while I was at it.)

	If you'd like you can send me a copy of what you sent out and I'll
let you know what is "wrong" with it.  

	There are two catagories you letter may fall into.  One is the
"chain-letter" type which proclaims to bring you good luck if you send out
copies to 25 of your friends.  This seems harmless but many people feel
that this can multiply and clog up the network and clutter disk space
with "useless email".

	Then there is the "fast-cash" type.  These are the ones which
are generally illegal.  They are pyramid schemes which promise to make the
receipient rich or some such nonsense.  (If people stop and think...hey if
we "all" do it we'll all be rich!...they would understand how foolish they
are to participate.)  Of course the only one with a chance of getting
"rich" is the originator.

	Regards,

		Ed

[I assume you are downloading from a Unix to a DOS system.]

Text files in Unix and DOS use different end-of-line conventions. Unix
uses a "New Line" character (same as LF in DOS). DOS (and CP/M) uses 2
characters, a Carriage Return and Line Feed at the end of each line. The
Mac uses only a CR.

If you use Z-MODEM to download and invoke it from the Unix command line,
use the -a switch to automatically change to DOS end-of-line conventions.
Thusly:

sz -a my.text.file

Yes, I have the same problem on AIX with pine 3.93.
Composing, replying is sometimes difficult. Thankfully, Ctrl-L solves
 the problem - it clears the screen.

I use pine on AIX4.1.4 using all kinds of terminals: xterm, aixterm and dtterm.
Also, when "aixterm" is in VT102 mode (allows mouse-click asa command)
Extended PC keyboard keys (End, Home, etc.) hang pine session. I have to kill 
it and continue editing it as an interrupted message.

I've had this happen to me too, and the only time it did was when I
allowed Pine to create too many .pine-debug# files.  After a fourth one
was made, Pine didn't know who I was.  I have no idea if this has anything
to do with that error message, but that's how it happened to me.  Try to
delete the .pine-debug# files to see if that helps.  I now use Pine with
the debug level off.

It looks to me as if you are do not have secure RPC credentials. When you
login your UNIX password is found but your network credentials are not,
consequently USER is not being set (if you look carefully at the screen
during the login process you will see a message on the lines of 'unable to
set USER' flash up. It may be that your secure credentials do in fact
exist but the passwords are different, most administrators will try to
keep the two synchronised so that their users are not troubled by the the
2 login processes (login and keylogin).

If you or your systems admin would like help with sorting this out I can
help and I have a bunch of scripts to handle NIS+ problems of this nature
but I guess you'd better write to me directly as its a Solaris admin issue
not a pine one. (Unless there are dozens of Pine users out there with the
same problem and want to follow the discussion).

If you are the system administrator, increase the size of the partition 
that mail resides on.  If not, delete some of your files in your 
directory, and then delete some mail.  As a system administrator myself, 
I can't stand mail pack rats!  Print it out and keep it if it is 
important!

When I keep email I do so because I want to be able to reference it later
on, which I would much rather do via the Unix file tools (ie grep etc)
than flipping through pages and pages of printed out email messages.  Who
needs more paper in their life?

Of course, I also sort my mail into various folders, and keep a minimal
amount of messages in my INBOX, so I never have to worry about that OUT OF
SPACE message.

Mark,
Did you ever get an answer to this question?
I noticed something very interesting on my AIX 4.1 box 2 weeks ago myslef.
I was originally runing Pine 3.91, 3.94 on a Linux box and will move it
over to the AIX host. Well one of the problems was regarding how the
sendmail on the Linux (1.2.13) handled headers from my Novell MHS/SMTP
gateway. Now on the AIX bow the problem just vanished.
So maybe what caused you probelms was the correction to mine.

Subject: Pine on AIX UNIX v4.1


I was finally able to get a good compile of Pine on my AIX 4.1 machine, but only
after some rather serious alteration of several Pine source files.  Somehow, I 
doubt that I should have done this, but since this is (for now at least) a test 
machine ...

Anyway, the problem appears to be related to the way comments in some source 
files are handled.  At least that's what the "C" compiler seemed to be 
complaining about.  For example, in the /pine3.95/pine/osdep/os-a41.h file, 
several comment lines appear like this:

   /* #include <sgtty.h>      /* BSD-based systems */                        

As far as I understand comment lines in "C" source code, the delimiters are the 
/* and */ sequences.  However, in many lines like the one above, two left-hand 
delimiters occur prior to a single right-hand one.  The only way I was able to 
get Pine to properly "build" (compile) was to alter these comments by removing 
the second left-hand delimiter.

After making this change, the compiles seemed to go without a problem.  However,
I noticed that the file sizes ended up dramatically different on AIX 4.1 
compared to AIX 3.2.5.  For example, after compiling all programs on AIX 3.2.5, 
the binary files created were:

     $ ls -l                                                    
     total 21768                                                
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys      1717607 Sep  8 18:34 imapd
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys      1557523 Sep  8 18:34 mtest
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys       861076 Sep  8 18:34 pico 
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys       858637 Sep  8 18:34 pilot
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys      6137198 Sep  8 18:34 pine 
     $                                                          
     
but on the AIX 4.1 system, the same binary files looked like this:

     $ ls -l                                           
     total 10936                                                
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit    1054577 Oct  5 07:42 imapd
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit    1013146 Oct  5 07:42 mtest
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit     291237 Oct  5 07:42 pico 
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit     289062 Oct  5 07:42 pilot
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit    2938894 Oct  5 07:42 pine 
     $                                                 
     
Despite the differences in file sizes, Pine on the AIX 4.1 system seems to work 
just fine.  Hmmmm.

My questions are:

1.   If alteration of the source code comment lines is NOT the proper way to
     get around the compilation failures, what is the proper method?

2.   If the resulting binary files are not the proper sizes, what happened?

Thank you for any comments you may have.

You now use the same commands to handle lists as to handle ordinary
aliases, except that you give more than one address in the (new) alias
editing screen.

Hia,

Sorry to trouble you, but I need serious help. Although this doesn't
revolve around what you specialise in, I hope you can help me.

Problem: Since installing Duke Nukem3d, Duke 2, and the build files, my
screen has gone very dark in both DOS, and Win95.
Is there a command I can use to rectify this?

Please Help.

Wow - revelation.  I see messages from others, however, as 
"From: Some Guy <someguy@bla.com>", whereas yours, butterfly's, and mine
are simply 'from' our addresses.. I'd really like to have my name
preceding my address, if that's possible.

Are there any neat solutions for having pine automatically uuencode and 
include in the text a binary file, rather than having to send it as an 
attachment to an unknown foreign mailer?

A reasonable assumption, but not always correct.  Often, I have been
able to view 8-bit characters without further ado, but I have had to
set terminal attributes in order to type them.

I assume this is due to programs following the "be conservative in what
you send, but liberal in what you accept" adage.

When I attach a file from a floppy, I am prompted to create a sentmail 
folder.  However the folder sentmail already exists.  If I answer yes, 
the message is aborted.  If I answer No, the header changes to FCC: 
sentmail.  I then delete the sentmail header and the attachment is sent 
successfully.  However, when I go to my folders, my savemail and sentmail 
folder no longer exist.  When I exit PC Pine and restart, the folders 
Inbox, savemail and sentmail are there again.

It seems that when I send attachments, my folders are erased for some 
reason.

What should I do?

Hi,

	Just want to make a note here.....

	I'm running pine3.95 under Solaris with tcsh.  I've some entries
in my .login and .cshrc files which include a couple of stty commands.
They "seem" to be needed when I'm using some telnet clients from my 
PC.  I say "seem" since I'll have to go back an recheck....

	Anyway, if an rsh is done a system on the network to the system
with my INBOX I will always get:

stty: : Invalid argument

	Whatever command I enter in the rsh will work fine.....

	So, I get the following with imapd:

hobbes[49]% rsh calvin /etc/rimapd
stty: : Invalid argument
* PREAUTH calvin.twntpe.cdc.com IMAP4 Service 8.3(140) at Tue, 8 Oct 1996
10:57:15 +0800 (GMT) (Report problems in this server to
MRC@CAC.Washington.EDU)

	This will cause pine to consider this a failure and ask me for
my username/pw.  Removing the stty commands fixes the problem.  Maybe
the pre-authentication process can be a bit more forgiving?

	Regards,

		Ed

This is because your trying to execute an stty command (via
.cshrc or .login) but there is no tty!  You should move
these stty commands into .login and wrap them in something
like:

if ($?prompt) then
 stty ...
 stty ...
endif

I'm not sure about the exact syntax because I do not use
tcsh (and the prompt may need to be caps).  This is surely
in the tcsh man page.  As far as other shells go (i.e.
POSIX-like shells), htis test should suffice:

if `tty -s`;then
  stty ...
  stty ...
fi

This breaks rdist on some systems as well, but the
rpeauthentication process doesn't need to be more forgiving,
the shell needs to be configured correctly (via .profile, or
in your case .login).

Hope this helps.

	Yes, it helps...and as time permits I'll work on fixing "my"
problem.  So, far this is the only "problem" I've had with my setup
so you can understand that there had been no incentive to find a
solution.  :-)

Dear All,
	Could someone tell me how I could configure pine3.95 in order that
all the mail that is sent includes a reply-to that contains a domain name
other than server that I'm currently using. I'm intending to use a mail
forwarding service eg. pobox.com
	I cannot change the domain name in unix pine as it has been set by
the sys admin. Is there any filter program out there that does this?
Thanks!


Just Me,
Aaron Aw

Doesn't sound unreasonable, does it?  Try emailing help@telis.org and ask
how to do it.  MAYBE they'll tell you...

Crude way is to do a screen capture with your terminal software (procomm
does this with alt-f1) while you scroll the file. Does the menu allow
this? I had to do that for about a year because the lousy provider just
couldn't set up the system to support zmodem -- WHICH IS THE STANDARD OF
THE INDUSTRY, FOR GOD'S SAKE!  

If you want to download WordPerfect files, you will have to use uuencode
(if they offer this) to translate it into printable characters, do the
scroll thing, and then uudecode (you will need the uudecode.exe program on
your hard disk -- god knows how you're going to get it unless somebody can
give it to you on diskette) it when it gets to your hard disk. 

This is obviously an awfully cumbersome way to do things.  Best thing to
do is bug your provider.  If they simply don't offer any downloading
capabilities, you might use lynx to check out http://www.thelist.com which
lists ISPs by state, area code, etc., and find somebody who is more
reasonable.  Hang in there, things *will* get better :)

    This could possibly be a result of incompatible settings in the two
different communications programs you are using for the download -- one
program running on your "host" (where your textfile is) and one on your
"desktop" (where you are trying to download to).  A lot of the *good*
dekstop communications programs have the ability to adjust the lineends
on the fly during transmission and reception.  Check your user's
manual.

	Ooooppps....you didn't do "Information Research" did you????

	Go to Setup/Config......

        OPTION: Customized-Headers
 
You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.

	Good Luck.....

	Hummmm, will "alias" work with all shells?  I think not....

When converting from elm to pine, I made an alias for elm
as "pine -i".  Worked like a charm, and it is now muscle memory
only.

As an added benefit it is shorter and faster to type :-)

In your Pine configuration, make sure that:

  1. the "read-message-folder" variable is "<No Value Set>" and
  2. the "auto-move-read-msgs" option is not checked

Exiting Pine will leave all mail, read or unread, in the inbox without asking.

Neither does a .login file (ie. bash uses .bash_profile)...  but it does

Pico doesn't seem to use character 13 for end of line.

When I download a textfile, everything is all run together.

Does anyone know how to deal with this problem other than manually 
editing the file after I download it?

My provider only lets us have Pine or Lynx through a menu, we cannot 
access the UNIX prompt.  Somehow there must be a way to get mail onto our 
own hard drives from within Pine itself?

	Dear help,

    I am trying to find a persons e-mail address at the University of
Creighton in Omaha, Nebraska.  I have tried the finger command and have 
been unsuccessful.  I was wondering if there was some sort of
compatability problem or maybe I was using the wrong command to search for
this address.  If there is some help you can give me in my search for this
e-mail address I would certainly appreciate it.

	Corey Williams

    In general, NO.  There are some proprietary mail systems which will
do this, but there simply is no way to do it across the Internet.  I'm
afraid you're out of luck.  Sorry.

First,

if you are using Procomm Plus or similar comm program then: {just download
the file using Zmodem as usual} otherwise: sz -b {filename} will start the
downloading process if you want to start at the unix shell prompt.

one thing though:

when you get these and view them in WP 5.1 for DOS {example}, you may 
have to view it and/or save the file as DOS text instead of the way they 
came downloaded as you might find a bunch of cntrl codes throughout.

I believe the authentication warning is coming from the mail daemon, not
Pine. '-bs' as an option to sendmail, etc tells it to accept a message
using SMTP protocol. Presumably the Pine mailer is invoking sendmail to
deliver the message, and something in the mailer configuration thinks this
is suspicious and adds this header.

    Automatically?  Not that I can recall.  If you are using the
alternate editor feature, some editors might have the ability to run a
command or script which you would still have to invoke but which would
uuencode the file in the current editor workspace.  If such a thing is
doable, it would depend totally on what editor you might be using.

    Unless you are talking about high volume, I have not found it all
that onerous to uuencode a file offline and then read it into the
composer or editor.

    Assuming your version of Pine is recent enough, from the Main Menu
go into Setup and Config.  Scroll down to the character-set variable
and set it to ISO-8859-1.  This will at least get rid of the annoying
message.  Whether you will actually see accented ISO letters depends on
your display hardware.  Typing in the letters should not be a problem
if you can display them.  Are you using the built-in composer?  If so,
I will have to let someone else address that.  I have been using the
alternate editor feature for so long that I have forgotten a lot about
the composer.  My editor allows me to enter accented letters, and Pine
accepts them without complaint.

    Somebody sent me the following shell script for rerunning procmail
against the Inbox.  I have never used it and cannot vouch for it.  Use
and/or adapt at your own risk.

#!/bin/sh
umask 077
lockfile -l3600 $HOME/.newmail.lock
lockfile -l3600 -ml
cat /usr/spool/mail/$LOGNAME >>$HOME/.newmail &&
cat /dev/null >/usr/mail/$LOGNAME
lockfile -mu
formail -s procmail <$HOME/.newmail
rm -f $HOME/.newmail $HOME/.newmail.lock
exit 0

    I don't know about this last one.

    (By the way, these really weren't Pine questions for this Pine
newsgroup.  There is a procmail mailing list for questions like these.)

I want to use Zmodem/rz to upload messages from my local machine
into Pine, but I don't know the proper rz command line to use for
for setting the PINE 'upload-command' and 'upload-command-prefix'
configuration options.  'Rz/sz' documentation has been elusive.

My SUN server is using PINE 3.95; I don't know the version of rz.

    Your question has nothing to do with Pine as such, which is what
this newsgroup is all about.  If you don't get any useful answers, I
would suggest that you try one of the Unix newsgroups.

]Can anyone tell me if it is possible to have pine separate out mail such
that if you subscribe to several lists, they can be sorted into separate
folders?  I know this already happens with news groups, but I was
wondering if it can be done with email.

This is one of the most frequently asked questions on the procmail
mailing list.  I suggest you look at the procmail mailing list 
archives, which are available through either of these:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/procmail/
  http://www.best.com/~ii/internet/procmail/ (mirror of above)

I think the best solution is if you can get your ISP to insert
a X-Envelope header, which you can use to filter the messages.
The problem is that when a user is Bcc'd you won't be able to
tell who it was intended for (unless the user's address shows
up in one of the Received headers but this doesn't always happen).
Good luck and please let us know if you find a good solution.

	At the moment you'd have to do a directory sync between the
X.500 directory and the global addressbook.  Currently pine does not
support LDAP, ph, or other protocols which could directly interface 
with X.500.  

	I'm not sure what the plans are....but I believe pine4.0 will
eventually support IMSP.  If I'm not mistaken...and I could be...IMSP
could be linked with an X.500 directory to provide address information.

	Regards,

Subject: source code identification
Date: 5 Oct 1996 19:57:01 GMT
Message-Id: <536eid$8it@ccshst05.uoguelph.ca>

We have a requirement to make a small local mod to the Pine3.95 code
(Unix), and I need help in identifying exactly where the mod should be
placed. When composing a message and after the To: and/or CC: or BCC: 
fields have been filled in, the user presses <enter> and these fields are
all reformatted and tidied up. We'd like to make a call to try to resolve
any unqualified local recipient addresses (i.e. nothing after the "@")
before the message is sent off to sendmail, and flash a warning in the
recipient is not a valid local user (forget about aliases for now, that's
a different story :)). So we need to know which module (pine, pico etc)
you are in at that point. Writing the mod itself is relatively trivial -
just need the location. 

The reason we need to do this - lots of users take it upon themselves to 
keep "mailing lists" of student userids. These get out of date very 
quickly as you might imagine. Passing off unresolved invalid addresses to 
sendmail causes an ugly processing overhead when it looks in NIS to 
resolve the recipients address. 

Thanks for any hints,

Scotty

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi All,

I've seen a few messages about Pine and PGP integration on this newsgroup,
and most of the solutions proferred suggest using a short shell script as
a filter or an alternate editor.

That seems somewhat of a pain to me: you either have to include your
passphrase in the script, or as an environment variable, or you have to
retype it all the time.

I've got a slightly different solution, which uses Richard Gooch's
PGPsendmail package (which is a Unix only thing, AFAIK). pgpsendmail
includes a program called pgpdaemon which sets up some named pipes and,
after you've sent it your passphrase, signs, and decrypts mail for you.

I've written some extra programs (to go with Mr Gooch's pgppipe which
decrypts mail), namely pgpsign (which clearsigns stdin to stdout) and
pgpencrypt (which encrypts and signs stdin to stdout).

With some fairly trivial filters, pine and pgp fit together transparently.
Encrypted messages get automagically decrypted, signed messages get a
validity segment stuck on the bottom, and any mail I send gets
automatically signed or encrypted.

It's a somewhat more complicated solution and it does have some minor
risks associated with it but I find that it works really well.

Cheers,
aj

use deliver or procmail. If You only want to sort out mailing lists i
recommend deliver it requires only shell programming skills...

There are two customised headers that can be added to a message which
might help Laurie. 

Return-Receipt-To: name@domain

This is not guaranteed to work but I find that most mail delivery agents
either recognise it and send confirmation of delivery or do not
recognise it and send a message saying its delivered the item but
it didn't know what to do with this header (which ends being the same
from the senders point of view). 

The other one

Read-Receipt-To: whoever@someplace

which I guess is closer to what Laurie wants, is dependent on the mail
user agent being used by the recipient to read the mail. At best (or worst
depending on how you feel about this kind of stuff) if the user agent
recognises the header it will confirm that the message has been opened for
reading. Simeon for instance will do this. Pine wont. 

Read receipts can be a very contentious issue though and you will need to
take into account that some people are very much opposed to them in
principle.

You can try www.whowhere.com. I think that's the right url. If it doesn't
work, you can also get to it via www.infoseek.com. It seems to be the best
of the email/people finding devices on the net.

To see new incoming mails, I have to logout and login again!

The mailbox normaly should be kept open constantly.

To the Fellow Old-Timers on this group:  Sigh.  We really do need some
way of handling the questions that keep coming up over and over and
over and over and over again from new people.

To Dan and Tina:  No, Pine will not do what you want, but other
techniques will.  If you have a World Wide Web browser, browse my home
page and follow the link to Nancy McGough's pages, where she has a lot
of useful and informative material on mail filtering.

Hi!

We use pine on an RS-6000 running AIX 3.2.5.  Our IBM 3151 terminals'
arrow keys work properly, but our Wyse 150 terminals do not, forcing
us to use control-P, etc.

Does anyone else had a similar problem?  What was your solution?

Hi,

I am using Solaris 2.4 on Sparc machine and I have problems with pine
3.95.

I am able to use pine with no problems. However, some of my users
getting the following error when they try to use pine:

"Who are you? (Unable to look up login name)"

What I have notice is that when I use the Unix command id I get
differenet results for the users that have the problems and for myself.
Myself I get the id as well as the user name while my users get the id
number without the username (login name). 

I would appreciate any help.

Thanks.

I'm trying to set up local newsgroups to read mail from
mailing lists with pine or tin, but can't seem to figure
out how to do it.

tin seems to want the "active" file in 
/usr/local/lib/news/active (it's not clear if active is
supposed to be a directory or a file)--

This is using FreeBSD.  Any suggestions would be 
appreciated.  I don't have any problem with pine or tin
reading news from an NNTP server.

Thanks very much--

Annelise

1.  Go into the Setup Configuration screen and make sure that
"enable-header-command" is selected.

2.  Return to index screen and view a message.  Type the (now available)
"H" command to turn on "full headers".

Cheers,

The syntax is:

For example I have in my .cshrc:

newmail -i 10


For more details refer to the online manual on newmail. At the unix prompt
type:

man newmail

I don't know why Pine is doing this.  It only does it when I send messages
to Usenet, and the message is listed as "To...." instead of with my
personal name.  I even set empty-header-value in Setup/Config to my
personal name, but that didn't work.  Is this possible to fix?

I believe it is possible to execute a script from with in the .forward 
file. I would like to run a script which parses incoming mail messages 
into separate html files as they arrive. I've tested the script and it 
works correctly but the only other way I can think of doing it is by 
running a cron process every now and then. It would be much more elegant 
though if it could be done on the fly. 

If this can be done, can anyone tell me what the correct syntax is?

Any help would be appreciated.

I've noticed that the pine composer adds double quotes around the "full name"
text (or the portion of the header text that is not the e-mail address) if one
of the characters is a ".". Could an unquoted "." misdirect message delivery?
Are there other characters that would trigger the use of double quotes?

Is there a way to mark messagese for delete *up to a certain point*?
Let's say you get half way through a newsgroup, and want to get out, and 
delete everything up to where you are?  Thanks.

I think I've fixed it.

I suspect that pine was re-writing the headers and that our sendmail
rules didn't understand them and left them un-touched.  Thus, incorrect
headers.

I played with the config and I selected no value for username and
for domainname (everything else has no value (or default) as I don't
use it).

And this works.

Hmm...

Hi. 
I'm having a problem with receiving mail from certain newsgroups.

I tried unsubscribing, then subscribing again and in all cases it read "0
messages." The newsgroups I subscibe to are "rec.arts.theatre.musicals"
which ALWAYS has hundreds of messages, "alt.music.a-cappella,"
"rec.music.a-cappella," and "alt.tv.er." 

I am getting messages from this group now, but I wondered why not the
other groups I was subscibed to. This has been going on for a few days now
and I'm very confused.

I tried posting to one of the groups and the next time I checked, my
message didn't appear.

Any explainations are greatly appreciated!

[Nothing that I had written earlier remains in your citation!]

This isn't an ASCII vs. binary transfer issue. He is making an ASCII
transfer. The trouble is the ASCII character used for the line boundary on
Unix systems (New Line, 010) is meaningless on the Mac, his home computer. 
Macs require a Carriage Return, 013.

A simple search and replace operation will solve his problem at home.

I am looking for a scripting utility of some sort that will let me send
mail to newsgroups using sendmail.. i have seen pine do this, but I have
been told it logs into port 119 and does a lot of stuff behind the
scenes.. i know you cant specify a newsgroup in sendmail and expect it
to get there... that doesnt work... i have been told there are some
scripts/utils out there that let you interface mail to news, and despite
searching tons of search engines I can find any....

any ideas?

You have to enable the tab feature in setup->config.

Subject: Corrupted addressbook
Date: 8 Oct 1996 17:46:52 GMT
Message-Id: <53e42c$ohj@dismay.ucs.indiana.edu>

I am a telephone consultant for unix at the university. Today someone 
called and said that when he typed in an addressbook nickname in the To: 
field, he got the name, and then lots of asterisks and the word "loop" 
somewhere in there. I told him to delete every entry and start over 
again.

Then I did some experimenting myself. I was unable to corrupt the file on 
my account, which I believe must have been .addressbook.lu, successfully. 
However, I did notice that if .addressbook.lu is deleted, Pine rebuilds 
it.

The question I have, then, is, is it good advice to tell people to delete 
their .addressbook.lu file if their addressbook is corrupted as described 
above?

	Please read RFC822.

Recent versions of pine support the download-command and
download-command-prefix in the config screen.  Basically it appears to be
a way to have pine start the appropriate command (sz, sx, kermit, etc)
for you automatically when you use Export.  If your ISP provides something
like Zmodem and has a recent enough version of pine you should be able to
configure pine to download email using these options.

Hi,

How do I change the From: field that Pine sends out,
or the default Reply To: that the recipient of my
messages gets. 

This is because my setup send mail out as if it
is coming from "root@my.isp's.domail" but my
real email address is "aamer@...."  I am only root
on my local machine.

Thanks a lot,
Aamer

	You can change the behaviour of pine....

	However, it sounds is if your basic problem needs solving.
If your are logging in as "aamer@foo.bar.com" then your mail should
go out as "aamer@foo.bar.com".  It should never go out as either
"root@foo.bar.com" or "root@isp.domain.com".

	You should discuss this situation with your ISP.  

	I don't know how you are connected with you ISP but I've
seen this sort of thing with mis-configured combinations of sendmail
and UUCP.

	I *strongly* suggest you fix the underlying problem rather
than maksing it with adjusting the behaviour of pine.

	Regards,

		Ed

On a related note, would it be too much for the Development Gods to allow
Pine to accept either end-of-line convention in its own files?  I just got
my wife up and running on PC-Pine, and we copied her addressbook from the
Unix box where she had been working.  PC-Pine couldn't make any sense of
it.  All I had to do was convert the end-of-line from Unix's LF to
DOS's CRLF pair, so it wasn't a big deal.  Still, this is something that
could be handled internally to Pine without too much trouble.

Out of curiosity, does PC-Pine handle Unix newlines in mail folders?  I
haven't tried copying over all her old mail folders yet.  Again, it's no
big deal to convert, but then again it would be no big deal to write Pine
to handle it itself...

We are now posting the "top 10" Pine FAQs monthly.  Do you think it
would help to post it more often?  Are there any other changes that
would make it more useful?

This message means that Pine found a loop when it tried to expand a
nickname.  Trace through the expansions and you should find the
error...

The .addressbook.lu file contains a hash table that Pine uses to speed
up searches, particularly for large addressbooks.  If Pine finds it to
be older than the .addressbook file or missing, it rebuilds the file.

Deleting the .lu file should not do anything except make Pine rebuild
it.  I would not expect it to solve the problem described above.

Pine has most of the functionality of metamail built-in.  It reads the

I have the exact same question, with the additional problem of having no
idea how to specify a 'personal name' in the first place..

Ummm.... I think I disagree with your assertion that "This isn't an ASCII
vs. binary transfer issue"...

A "binary" transfer copies over a file's content byte for byte, which is
necessary for binary data files such as images but useless for text files
unless both source and destination computer systems share the same
end-of-line conventions.

In contrast an "ascii" transfer converts the line ending used by the
source computer into a standard form (what character(s) get used for this
I admit I forget/never knew).  The receiving computer spots each of these
standard endings and converts them into its own (possibly different) line
ending.

This makes it possible to exchange files using ascii ftp transfers between
such diverse systems as:

*  UNIX (line feed only at line end)
*  Macintosh (carriage return only at line end)
*  PC (carriage return + linefeed at line end)
*  VMS (a 2-byte line length count followed by data, possibly including
   both carriage return and/or line feed characters!)

Cheers,

Two ways of doing this for Usenet News (or ordinary mail folders)...

*  The usual way is to delete the messages as you read through them (ie,
use the "D" command to "finish with" a message and advance to the next).

But if you don't do this and want to mark them "deleted"
retrospectively...

*  First make sure you have the "aggregate-command-set" feature enabled in
Pine's Setup Configuration screen.  Now open the folder and start working
through it.  At some point, when you want to break off, you can give a
series of keystrokes like this:

	; N		... Select messages based on their message number
	1-32		... Choose message whose numbers (within the
			    folder listing) are 1 to 32 inclusive.
	A D		... Apply a "Delete" command to the selected
			    messages

Cheers,

I just installed 3.95 on my sco unix machine.  I use various telent
programs to telnet to my unix server.  Some work stations can print from

software (Lanworkplace), some can print and others can't.  I have config
set at print to ansi.
Please help

If I reverse the order in my /etc/hosts file to read:

	neptune.radionics.com neptune

then refreeze and restart sendmail, mail coming into my pine keeps the
full name.  So it seems my sendmail has become very dependent on the 
state of my /etc/hosts during the freezing and I don't know why.

I wrote some interface code for Pine which allows you to query a local CSO
nameserver while in the addressbook of Pine. It's been running for over a year
with no problems. You may want to take a look at it as a prototype. Email me for 
code if you're interested. (be warned - it's "sledgehammer-grade" code :))

Subject: Pine on AIX UNIX v4.1


I was finally able to get a good compile of Pine on my AIX 4.1 machine, but only
after some rather serious alteration of several Pine source files.  Somehow, I 
doubt that I should have done this, but since this is (for now at least) a test 
machine ...

Anyway, the problem appears to be related to the way comments in some source 
files are handled.  At least that's what the "C" compiler seemed to be 
complaining about.  For example, in the /pine3.95/pine/osdep/os-a41.h file, 
several comment lines appear like this:

   /* #include <sgtty.h>      /* BSD-based systems */                        

As far as I understand comment lines in "C" source code, the delimiters are the 
/* and */ sequences.  However, in many lines like the one above, two left-hand 
delimiters occur prior to a single right-hand one.  The only way I was able to 
get Pine to properly "build" (compile) was to alter these comments by removing 
the second left-hand delimiter.

After making this change, the compiles seemed to go without a problem.  However,
I noticed that the file sizes ended up dramatically different on AIX 4.1 
compared to AIX 3.2.5.  For example, after compiling all programs on AIX 3.2.5, 
the binary files created were:

     $ ls -l                                                    
     total 21768                                                
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys      1717607 Sep  8 18:34 imapd
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys      1557523 Sep  8 18:34 mtest
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys       861076 Sep  8 18:34 pico 
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys       858637 Sep  8 18:34 pilot
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys      6137198 Sep  8 18:34 pine 
     $                                                          
     
but on the AIX 4.1 system, the same binary files looked like this:

     $ ls -l                                           
     total 10936                                                
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit    1054577 Oct  5 07:42 imapd
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit    1013146 Oct  5 07:42 mtest
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit     291237 Oct  5 07:42 pico 
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit     289062 Oct  5 07:42 pilot
     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     audit    2938894 Oct  5 07:42 pine 
     $                                                 
     
Despite the differences in file sizes, Pine on the AIX 4.1 system seems to work 
just fine.  Hmmmm.

My questions are:

1.   If alteration of the source code comment lines is NOT the proper way to
     get around the compilation failures, what is the proper method?

2.   If the resulting binary files are not the proper sizes, what happened?

Thank you for any comments you may have.

We are currently running Pine 3.91 on an IBM RS/6000 with AIX 3.2. We may 
be losing access to the IBM and are investigating the possibility of 
moving our freenet and Pine software to a Linux run PC. Is it possible to 
switch Pine from one system to another? Or does the original UNIX 
compilation make that impossible? Would we be better off getting a newer 
version and compiling it for Linux? Our tech support goes with the 
IBM, so please excuse these questions if they are obvious to you, I'm an 
administrator not a programmer.

	You are runnnig pine3.91.  The current and much better version
is pine3.95.  The binary for AIX is not compatible with LINUX.  Therefore,
you are advised to get the latest source for pine and recompile.

	Regards,

YES! I'd recommend following the lead of some other high-traffic
groups I read often (e.g. comp.lang.perl.misc and several
comp.infosystems.www... groups).  Post a relatively short document
daily (yes, daily) with the Top-10 FAQs and pointers to more
information (and a prominent request to check those sources first
before posting to the group).

Realistically, the "problem posts" don't come from people who've been
reading the group for a few weeks (and are therefore likely to have
seen a once-a-month posting).  They come from people who haven't read
the newsgroup at all.

If the post is given a "supercedes" header, no one will ever see more
than one copy of the FAQ, but it will _always_ be there in the
newsgroup.  Anyone who feels that daily posting of a FAQ list is
"wasting net bandwidth" should consider that if such a posting
squelches only two queries per day, it has already paid for its
passage.

Thanks very much.  Timothy Luoma and Michael Seibel jumped right on the
problem and pointed me right at the cause.

I had not looked at /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed--thinking "fixed"
meant "repaired".

On the machines where "pine" works, that file (....fixed) had a
line that pointed "smtp-server" (through a CNAME) to our mail machine.

On the machine where "pine" did not work, the "pine" wizard had entered a
line that pointed to the machine it was on.

I made it look like the others, and "pine" now seems to be its normal
useful self.

You folks may not be able to fully appreciate just how grateful I am.

Hmmmm... I was considering writing something similar myself (getting
awfully tired of retyping my passphrase for every single outgoing
email, and not thrilled about that passphrase going unencrypted across
our network here).  But if you've done the work, I'd be delighted to
parasitize it.  

Care to post the code, or a pointer to it?  

Thanks!

Hello everyone.

Our system uses a set of aliases for internal users. When the  message 
comes to the user's system address (like sklydm@ipc.org) it has a + mark 
indicating the message addressed personally to that user; but when the 
message comes to the alias address (like DmitriySklyar@ipc.org), which is 
an alias to the system address, the + mark is not present. Is there any 
way to have + mark for both system and alias address?

Thank you in advance.

Any help would be greatly appreciated..

I expect this is a stupid question, but how can I tailor the "Reply-to:" 
field of my outgoing email headers?  

I'm using Pine 3.95.  I've searched the docs, honest!

Thanks very much Joseph.  Thi is exactly what I was looking for.
My .pinerc file does not contain a user-id field, that's why I 
never figured this out.  I tried adding "user" and "user-name"
obviously with no luck.

Thanks again,
-aamer

The compiler or preprocesser will WARN you about "/* /* */"  constructs
but that should not cause the compile to fail.  The message should begin
with (W) which stands for warning which rhymes with ignore ;-)  Sometimes
you might start writing a comment in your code with a /* but forget to end
the comment with a */.  The compiler suspects that's what happened here
and is warning you.

This happened a few days ago, and neither I or my ISP have no idea what
causes it.  Our network at cmr.fsu.edu was isolated from the outside world
for awhile.  Though we couldn't telnet/ftp/etc. out from our site,
everything still worked.  However, Pine decides to freeze when sending a
message, even if it's to a user on our site.  Elm continued to work fine,
and it put messages that were to be sent out from our site into a queue,
which would deliver them later once the network was re-establishedl;
Messages that were sent to users locally were delivered immediately.  As
for Pine......FREEZE!  ????????  Could someone tell me why this is
the case?  Is this a Pine configuration that needs to be set?

Hi,

Solaris 2.5 SPARC. /var/mail is NFS mounted on a dedicated mail
server.

Problem: About every 10 minutes or whenever I need to write to my
inbox (new mail comes in or deleteing mail) there are error messages
regarding the INBOX and pine aborts and asks to quit and restart. The
error messages include "INBOX length 0 aborting..".."invalid mailbox
format".." unknown error consult an expert".. They all relate to
the inbox and it appears the inbox is being written too when it should not
be.

I have tried:

o Diffrent versions of pine
o removing all .pinerc, .pine-conf, .pine-debug? and restarting
o removing sent-mail
o running pine directly on the mail server (no NFS)
o deleteing the INBOX to 0 length
o running from a bare shell (no .login .profile .csh)
0 creating a new account and forwarding mail to that account. the new
  account works on so the mail headers are fine.
0 watching the creation of /usr/mail/stephen.lock is created and deleted
  when the inbox is needed to be written too. verified ok.

Im at a loss. This problem is not effecting anyone else but me. What other
files does pine open/use? Any help appreciated.

On Unix you create a ".forward" file in your home directory.  It has
nothing to do with Pine as far as I know.  Pine is a UI (MUA) to your
mail, other programs are used to control the other aspects of mail.
The ".forward" file simply contains the address to forward to.  

I just did "man mail" and there is a section on forwarding mail.

If you want to get fancy you can use your ".forward" file to call
"procmail" and filter your mail into different Pine inboxes, forward
to another address, or dump into "/dev/null".

Hope that helps.

Finger is included even on many PC TCP/IP stacks, plus it is on every UNIX I
have seen, and on most VMS stacks.  In a window environment it frequently
has to be run from a shell window.

 >that others cannot finger their account.  Third, and most importantly,

How does a user setup their account so that people cannot finger her?

finger on Solaris 2.x of ellis@gmi.edu  provides the following info:

1. A particular model year of car wouldn't be available until after that
   year instead of before it.
...

Note the "Mail last read Thu Oct 10 16:56:36 1996", which is about as good
as the info gets, but it does allow a user to infer that I have not checked
my mailbox in about 30 minutes, even though the xterm with pine in it is
always open in the bottom right corner of my display.  If the user sent the
mail yesterday they would be within their rights to assume I was ignoring
their mail and could mail me enquiring if I got it, which might make me feel
guilty enough to respond.

What are the rules for using the "attached-to-ansi" printer
while using a terminal emulator from a PC

1) does ANSI.SYS need to be loaded ?
2) do parallel printers work ?

thanks

Just don't use a mailreader as a newsreader.

	You searched the setup/config settings and "customized-headers"
didn't smack you in the face?  :-)

        OPTION: Customized-Headers

You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.

    I have never tried this, because I want people to be able to finger
my account, but according to the user manual from my service provider:

        cd $HOME
        touch .nofinger
        chmod 711 .
        chmod 755 .nofinger

	What version of pine are you running?

	With luck it is version 3.95.  

	Do some "Information Research" on the Bcc: and Lcc: headers.

    My service provider has been having news hiccups lately, so I don't
recall even having seen such a "top 10" FAQs.  (There could be various
posts I have missed.) I think it is a very good idea.  As for its
contents or format I cannot say, not having seen it, but I would
suggest that in addition to posting it at least monthly, posting a
pointer to it every two weeks (if not every week) at least would be a
good idea, too.  A lot of newcomers could get on comp.mail.pine just
after the most recent posting, not know about it, and wind up asking
the same old questions all over again.  (Of course, their questions are
legitimate quests for useful information.)  A brief and judiciously
worded notice, with a URL, posted on a regular basis might give new
people occasion to check a FAQ first.

ASS/U/MEing?

I'm using a Commodore 128 with Desterm 2.0.  It uses 13/10 pairs (the 10 
usually added automatically)

Maybe I'll just leave well enough alone.

Surely there must be a way to send mail to every alias in your address
book.  I've tried typing "all" in the TO field, but that's just wishful
thinking.  Does anyone know how to do this?

Thanks,

I've put together a couple distribution lists, and, following the Pine help
instructions, inserted the distribution list "nick" in the "Lcc" header. 

According to the help menu, the "name" of the distribution list should
appear in the "To:" area (e.g.: "Name.of.list": ;). But what I get
appearing is the name of the list *plus* the name of the first person on
the list (e.g.: "Name.of.list"Joe.Smith: ;).

The whole point of using Lcc is to hide the names on the list. Furthermore,
it would be confusing for a John Smith to get a message apparently mailed
to Joe Smith. I've put myself on the list also, so I know that what shows
up at the destinations is this same nick plus first name on list thing.  

Anyone know why this happens and how to prevent it?

I ran into similar problems when we moved from VMS Mail to Unix Pine.  I've had
success in getting messages to stay in proper order, without changing the
default sort option of "arrival," by:

 opening the folder (we'll call it "bob") I want to re-sort
 using "$d" to sort the messages (for this session only) by date
 using ";aastemp" to select all messages and move them all to a folder called
   "temp" - They are copied into the temp folder in the current sort order.
 using "gtemp" to go to temp
 using ";aasbob" to move the messages out of temp and back to bob, where they
   now show up in proper date order

I've had no problems with funky date formats from older messages, but I've read
here that others have.  Can't help with that, unless you want to manually edit
the mail file and "fix" the date headers so they're standardized!

Same problem here. Someone has to know why. I've got wy-30 termcaps file
going, but it still doesn't enable the arrows.

Hello,
I am a student at WVNCC in New Martinsville, WV.  We are currnetly using
pine for our Interent Research class and I have what I hope is a simple
question.  I know that I can expunge in Pine but is there a way to compress
our mail also.  I thought perhaps expunge would do it but when I exit pine
I still have to go in and compress my mail seperatley.  Is there any way to
compress in pine? If so please tell me how.  Thank you for taking the time
to read and answer this post.

Thank you for the good advice; I have used the log capture in ProComm.  
But, I am trying to set this up for a man who is using a Braille reader, 
and is not used to switching between programs or Internet protocols.  Our 
provider only supports Windows, and Netscape just downloads your mail for 
you automatically.  I've been going over there and downloading his stuff 
for him in Windows and saving to his hard drive.  He wants to be 
independent, though...

In pine, type ^R while your cursor is in the headers to show
rich headers, which includes the Newsgroups header.  If you
have specified a nntp-server in your .pinerc, you can just
post from Pine.  If you haven't specified a nntp-server, I don't
know if Pine will let you mail that header to your mail2news
gateway - does anyone know?

The problem of the message compmaining about the possibly incorrect
character set has been addressed in previous answers. The problem of
keyboard may be in incorectly set locale variables. Try to set the LANG
environment variable to your language code (consult the man pages for
appropriate values). But it _may_ only be a solution.

Do note that (I forget which implementation of "finger" I know of that
does indeed support what you've described) only certain implementations of
"finger" support this--and I'm not sure that most even support it at that.

  Perhaps the permission on your ~/.addressbook and ~/.addressbook.lu
aren't set probably.

  Try this :

chmod u+rwx ~/.addressbook ~/.addressbook.lu

  Hope this helps.

A common warning I have seen about /etc/hosts is:

Always make sure that the fully qualified name of any machine is listed
first.

I've tidied it up a little, so it should be close to usable for others 
now.

If you've got web access, point your browser at:
	http://student.uq.edu.au/~s343676/pgpdaemon

A warning, though: it's beta software, and I didn't take _that_ much
care to make sure it's robust, reliable, or secure. It *should* be,
but no promises.

If you don't have web access (really? Wow. I *am* impressed), mail me,  
and we'll work something out.

As was Richard Gooch's original, it's GPLed and hence freely 
redistributable. I'm not quite game to advertise it too widely yet,
though. :) 

Cheers,
aj

I know of only two self moderated newsgroups, alt.hackers and
alt.sysadmin.recovery (According to hearsay. I haven't read either for
quite some time.) In both of those the purpose of the self moderation
is to avoid people who are unable to find out such things themselves.

Yes, this is elitism, but in the case of alt.hackers this is all that
prevents it from become the cesspool which alt.hacker is. (This, too,
according to hearsay.)

Just to get you started: All the information you need is in pine + an
average article in the newsgroup in question.

Ørjan.

Subject: Re[2]: Pine on AIX UNIX v4.1


     Thank you to everyone (especially Tim Cheney) who made suggestions on 
     compiling Pine on an AIX UNIX v4.1 box.  Tim was correct:  the "C" 
     compiler does issue warnings (not fatal errors) as a result of the 
     double-left-delimiter entries in certain Pine source code files.  
     However, everything compiles just fine.
     
     Thanks again.
     
     - Michael
     
     P.S.  May we all have a brief case of neophyte-itis at least once --
           and may we learn from that experience!   :)

The compiler or preprocesser will WARN you about "/* /* */"  constructs
but that should not cause the compile to fail.  The message should begin
with (W) which stands for warning which rhymes with ignore ;-)  Sometimes
you might start writing a comment in your code with a /* but forget to end
the comment with a */.  The compiler suspects that's what happened here
and is warning you.

Save them as files with the (E)xport command, then while composing (with
pico) ^R (control + r) to "read in" those files, then ^K to cut out what
you do NOT want.  Maybe someone else has a simpler way, but that works for

I wonder if you can help me. I can not access my inbox, as the screen
always reads "file not open", and it altermatically returns to the menu
page. I can send out messages still. I have used pine successfully for
over a year, and have never had this problem.....any ideas appreciated,
        thankyou, Clare

One possibility might be to use an anonymous IMAP server and
one of their public folders as your fake INBOX.  Does anyone
know if this will work?  Does PC-Pine require an IMAP connection
to be able to send messages?

Thanks,

You might want to take a look at mkpgp 2.1 also...  It's a csh script, and
if I remember correctly, the author included some sort of a daemon-type
script to pass along your passphrase to pgp.  I believe it's called pph and
it's in the archive's Ancillaries directory.  I'm not using it though (the
daemon), so sorry about the lack of detail.

# List of SMTP servers for sending mail. If blank: Unix Pine uses sendmail.
smtp-server=

This is just a stab in the dark, but does the above field (from .pinerc) have
anything defined in it?  If so, that might be the problem...  Try leaving it
blank, then it'll use sendmail which will queue the message for delivery
when the network comes back up.

Hi,
 I am familiar with the MH mail program (which is what I use at work),
but at home on my Linux system, I use pine 3.91 (soon to upgrade to
3.95).  The problem I'm having is that I subscribe to a digestified
mailing list and have not found a way to break the digest appart into
individual messages.  With MH, there is a "burst" command to perform
this action.  Is there a way to do this with pine?

Thanks
 Frank

Stephen:

  Just an idea...the last time you restarted sendmail on the server did
you login as root, su from your personal account, or sudo?  I recommend
you make sure you do it the first way.


Hope this hilft,

Tim

Hi there,

Is there a possibility to thread news messages in pine, without threading
my mail messages in my mailbox?

I find it very disappointing to see how pine does the news reading. Can I
make this something more useable?

Regards,
Koen.

After getting enough complaints from users about AIX Pine 3.95 hanging
when starting the compose function, I decided to look at the Pine source
code to see if I could determine the problem.  The problem is that Pine
itself is compiled using terminfo support, while the pico module is
compiled using termcap support, and when switching from Pine to Pico it
gets confused (thanks to bill@nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu who also
spent the time to independently discover this problem).

To fix, you need to have Pine and Pico be consistant in using either
termcap or terminfo, but not both. Since terminfo is better supported for
AIX, I picked terminfo. In the pico directory:

Modify either makefile.a41 or makefile.a32, depending on which
version of AIX you are using, by changing tcap.o to tinfo.o and tcap.c to
tinfo.c.

In os_unix.h, change the line just above "#defined TERMINFO 1" by
appending " || defined(a32) || defined(a41)". This is line 94 in the 3.95
release, but don't rely on the line # for other versions.

bill@nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu also mentioned a fix to tinfo.c by changing the
following lines:

original line: setupterm (0, 1, &err);
modified line: setupterm((char *)0, 1, &err);

original line: setupterm(0, 1, 0);
modified line: setupterm((char *)0, 1, (int *)0);

I sent a bug report about the os_unix.h and makefile fixes, and I hope
that the Pine folks incorporate these changes in the next release, since
the fix is included in the bug report (don't they wish all bug reports
included their own fixes!).

When we see stuff like that around here it is usually caused by the user=20
(for some reason) running both POP3 and IMAP at the same time.

You shouldn't for some reason have tried using the Netscape Navigator
Mail facilities?  That is the usual cause here (except we don't have=20
the mail NFS mounted, so the users have to set it up to the POP3 server
first).

Give Netscape brainsurgery and tell it to forget all about your mail!

Subject: Cannot receive messages in Pine


     After installing Pine v3.95 on an IBM AIX v3.2.5 machine, every user 
     but one is sending and receiving mail without problems.
     
     Configuration:
          UNIX host running Pine v3.95 and sendmail, on AIX 3.2.5
          SMTPLINK product by cc:Mail, running on a PC gateway
          cc:Mail for Windows for most users
          Pine v3.95 on UNIX for other users
          (Used to have WordPerfect Office email for UNIX)
     
     One particular user has always been able to send/receive email without 
     problems.  After installation, however, this one user cannot receive 
     any messages.  Also, most messages this user sends are not getting 
     sent to their recipients (some work fine).
     
     The user has a /u/username/.forward file that points to the SMTPLINK 
     gateway.  The entry in .forward is of the format:
          username@smtplink
     SMTPLINK is defined as a valid hostname in /etc/hosts.
     
     The aliases file has been reprocessed (with newaliases).  The sendmail 
     daemon has been reloaded.  The WordPerfect Office daemon has been 
     removed.
     
     When I send an email to any other Pine mail recipient, the outbound 
     message gets properly copied into the /usr/spool/mqueue directory and 
     awaits handling by sendmail.  When the mail arrives for most users, 
     the inbound file is properly appended to the /usr/spool/mail/username 
     file.  Not so for this one user.  Regardless of who sends the message, 
     this one user's /usr/spool/mail/username file ever gets appended with 
     the new email message.
     
     I cannot determine why, all of a sudden following the Pine email 
     installation, this one user fails to send/receive messages properly.  
     No doubt, it's due to something simple, but darned if I can see it ...
     
     Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.   :)

    I'm on version 3.94, not 3.95, but I suspect the configuration
option is the same in both: mail-check-interval.

I had this problem with my Wyse-60 terminals, and someone posted a 
response about this that went something like this.  You can add the 
option -DTERMCAP_WINS to the STDCFLAGS option in the makefiles in the 
pine and pico directories.  This will disable the ctrl function 
associated to arrow key, but it will make the arrow keys work.  Be sure 
to do a build clean and delete the existing executables before 
recompiling.

I am having trouble compiling Pine for my new Intel DG Aviion.  I 
compiled using the d-g params, but that was no help.  I know this is a 
fairly new system, but can anybody give me any help with this?

You can set up a distribution list. Go to the addressbook and type (a)dd.
Put the "nicks" of all the people you want to send to in the "Addresses"
field and put the name of the mailing list ("all" will work) in the
"Nickname" field. 

Compose a letter and type "all" (or whatever the Nickname is) in the "To"
field. Pine will put all the appropriate addresses in for you.

    This could be very difficult, to put it mildly.  First, many
people could be using Pine with terminals or terminal emulators that
have no ANSI graphics capabilities.  What about them?  What happens
when message streams with ANSI control characters hit their terminals? 
One possibility is havoc and a lot of swearing at whoever sent such a 
*&$#@!*?* message.

    And just what are "extended DOS Ascii characters"?  My guess is
that you are referring to characters represented by values 128 - 255 on
DOS code page 437.  I don't have figures, but my hunch is that this is
meaningless to the overwhelming majority of Pine users, probably most
of whom don't even use DOS at all.  Of those who do, many may use code
pages other than 437, such as 850 or 819, which do not have those
nifty-swifty symbols from CP 437.  I'm afraid your suggestion won't fly
very far in Pine's real world.

Subject: sent-mail folder displays wrong in pine 3.93
Date: Mon, 07 Oct 1996 14:44:11 GMT
Message-Id: <53b4u7$7e4@news.pinc.com>

Good day all.  We have recently installed pine 3.93 over 3.91 on a
Linux system and have incurred the following problem.

A user dials in using Telix 3.15 and sends mail using extended
characters to communicate in French. When we were using pine 3.91 this

user could view his sent-mail folder and still see the message as it
was entered.  Now, with pine 3.93, he sees DOS extended characters -
you know, the ones that make lines and boxes under DOS - when trying
to view the sent-mail folder.

He composes his mail off-line, uploads it and uses pine's ^R to read
in the file.  At this point he can view the message as it was typed.
Incoming mail can be viewed correctly.

Anyone know how we can help this user view his sent-mail folder?

    Thanks,
          Dave

All global-address-book's are ReadOnly to simplify access contention
problems.  If you want to manually update a global addressbook, list
it as one of your personal addressbooks.

Hey guys,
 I'm having a little bit of a problem with PINE version 3.95...  My
service provider, who is running Linux, installed v3.95 tonight.  Whenever
I load Pine, get a message across the bottom of the screen (on the
line right above the keying options) that says:

"error creating/var/spool/mail/maverick.locl.845103665.13224.server.martek.net"

Please tell me what this is and how I can fix it...  

Other than this, I love version 3.95!

Thanks alot,
 Matt Coleman

That specification is correct.  Have you tested the IMAP server
manually?  You can do this by telnetting to port 143 on the server. 
If you allow pre-authenticated (rsh) access, try "rsh host.wherever
/etc/rimapd".

1. I assume you changed the user domain.
2. Try localhost as the smtp server (yes -- type localhost in the config
space -- it may not mean anything different, but it will probably get rid
of the problem).

Since 3.92 pine supports external filters which allow to realize PGP
support.  You will find souch filters at

Pine allows one to use PGP as a filter for en-/de-cryption.  I have
written a web page for this purpose:

	http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html

It is not too hard to do.  You can see the prompts for passphrase
and error messages if applicable.

There are a few other approaches for doing PGP in Pine.  If you do 
a web search (e.g. webcrawler), you'll find them.

Cheers!

	Is there a limit on the length of the value of the Fcc field for
addresses in PC-Pine 3.95 ?

	I have set up an address and selected a folder for mail to that
address to be Fcc'd to.  This all works a treat but when I go to save mail
FROM THAT ADDRESS the folder name is truncated (at about 64 characters I
think).

	Please reply by email to S.Oldfield@nla.gov.au

Thanks in advance

Yes, PC-Pine insists on having an IMAP folder open before it will send a
message.  It puts some info derived from the validated IMAP login into the
outgoing message so that faked email can be traced.

Offline support in PC-Pine is planned, but not yet available.

Subject: Re[2]: Pine & Wyse Terminals


On an RS/6000 under AIX 3.2.5, I made the following changes:

   In the ./pine/makefile.a32 file, added the "-DTERMCAP_WINS" entry:
     STDCFLAGS= -Dconst= -DA32 -DSYSTYPE=\"A32\" -DMOUSE -DTERMCAP_WINS

   And in the ../pico/makefile.a32 file, added the "-DTERMCAP_WINS" entry:
     STDCFLAGS= -D_ALL_SOURCE -Da32 -DJOB_CONTROL -DPOSIX -DMOUSE -DTERMCAP_WINS

After doing a "./build clean" and a "./build a32" to recompile, the function 
keys now work great on our Wyse-50 terminals.  Also tried this same change on an
RS/6000 running AIX 4.1.4.  It works fine.

Thanks for the tip!

and mather@pop.erols.com responded:
I had this problem with my Wyse-60 terminals, and someone posted a 
response about this that went something like this.  You can add the 
option -DTERMCAP_WINS to the STDCFLAGS option in the makefiles in the 
pine and pico directories.  This will disable the ctrl function 
associated to arrow key, but it will make the arrow keys work.  Be sure 
to do a build clean and delete the existing executables before 
recompiling.

Ah, but you may do this now. In your configuration, use
enable-alternate-editor-cmd. In the composer, while in the body of the
message, you will be able to use the command ^_. You will then be asked if
you wish to use the editor defined with your $EDITOR variable, or you may
specify another option. This will allow you to compose messages without
wordwrap using pico -w.

The other 2 editor configuration settings,
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly and define editor, are not useful for
your purpose. You wouldn't wish to use this feature for all composing tasks.

If you're using vi, you can use ":r <file>" from the edit mode to insert
entire files into the text. Just edit a file to you're liking before
mailing, and insert the whole file. 

If you aren't using Vi, you're really missing out.

This occurs when trying to run Pine as root.  I believe I have enough
free space on my partition.  Pine runs ok under other UID's.  I am
running Pine on Linux BTW.

THanks for any help or pointers to documentation.

    Have you looked at the Configuration options and read the online
help screens?  If so, you would have found that if you toggle on the 
enable-full-header-cmd, then when you are viewing a message just press
the 'H' key to see the headers in all their gory details.  This setting
will stay in place at least until the end of your session unless you
press 'H' again to turn full headers off.

    Pine comes with a wealth of online documentation, especially for
configuration options, but it does not read itself for you.

So you're on a Mac? As I said earlier, the end-of-line convention is CR. 
Since you can do search and replace already, simply substitute CR for NL.

Message-Id: <53q5f6$snh@xmission.xmission.com>

    I have a great many received messages, saved in a number of different
folders.  To reduce my use of disk space on my host, I want to download
these (which seem to be ordinary text files, basically) to my Linux box at
home, then use PINE to view/sort/extract these on my own disk.  

    However, when I've tried to do this, I have been unable to make PINE
see them as valid folders.  Any suggestions or pointers for further
reading?  TIA, Richard Ebling

  If all you want to change is only your name, you can go to the Setup
Configuration menu from the Main Menu by pressing "s", "c".
  The first field should be "personal-name". You can modify it.
  Hope this helps.

I'M NOT JOKING THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
BUT, DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT JUST TRY IT.  IT ONLY TAKES
A FEW MINUTES.

  I saw an article in an internet newsgroup telling me I could make
$50,000 within a month for an investment of only $5.

 I thought it  was a huge joke. I spoke  to my other college friends,
and
they all agreed it  was some kind of scam. I  can't stand scams, because 
usually someone gets burned, and I didn't want it to be me. Of course, I
rejected the idea at  first. after a short period of  about two weeks, 
I
thought  : "I have already  heard of such things.  But on the Internet
?!?!? ". I decided  that even if I had to throw $5 into the fire, I
wouldn't  mind it that much, and gave it a try.  After all I needed a
LOT
more than five dollars.


  One week later,  I began receiving money  -- every day!  I could not
believe it! Soon, hundreds,  and then thousands of dollars began to 
roll
in. Within 6 weeks, I  had received a total of $47,326!  It came from
everywhere in  the world. My bank account has changed its "-"  into a
big
"+" (++++)!!!


  If you follow the three steps  below, there is no reason why the  same
shouldn't  happen  to you!  This  is a  legitimate investment 
opportunity. You  invest $5,  and you  receive a return on  your
investment. So  does the next  investor. NOT ILLEGAL, NOT A CHAIN
LETTER-
PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE.

  If  you  are not  interested,  then  don't participate,  but please
print this article and pass  it on to someone who may be interested, so
they can take advantage.

  The  procedure is  simple:  1)  Write your name and address, an 
e-mail
address,  and the name of the newsgroup where you learned of this on 5
sheets of paper.  Below that, write the words, "Please add me to  your
list." Fold  $1 note  or bank draft or money order  in each  piece of
paper and  send them to the following 5 addresses.:

 

1. Landon
    #1 Lakeway Drive
    Conroe, Texas 77304  USA
2. Beyond Technology
    5641 Apgar Street
    Houston, Texas 77032  USA
3. Daniel DeKonty
    Lee College #88
    1120 N. Ocoee Street
    Cleveland,  TN  37320  USA
4. Don Noel
    222 NE Dogwood St #C103
    Issaquah, WA 98027 USA
5. Ryan Levine
    P.O. Box 576 
    Waterford CT 06385 USA
         
   2) Now remove the top name from the list, and move the other four
names
up. In other words,  #5 becomes #4 and so on. Put your name as the 
fifth
one on the list.   Use a simple text editor such as  Notepad,  in your  
"accessories" window (If you have  MS-Windows),or DOS  editor.   In
fact, 
any editor will do.
 
   3) Post  the article to at  least 200 newsgroups.  There are17,000,
so 
it shouldn't  be hard  to find  that many.   Try posting to as  many 
newsgroups as you can,   and the bigger the newsgroup is,  the more 
people are to see your message!
 
   You  are now  in  the an order services business, and should start
seeing returns within a week or two.   Of course,  the more newsgroups
you
post to, the greater your return is.  If you  wish to remain anonymous,
you may use a psuedonym, call yourself  "The Manager", "The Boss", 
whatever but make sure your address is correct.
 
   Now, here is why the system works:
 
   -Of every  200 posts  I made, I  received 5  responses. Yes,  only 5.
You make $5 for every 200 posts with your name at #5.
 
   -Each person who  sent you $1 now also  makes 200 additional postings
with your name at #4. ie. 1000 postings. On average therefore, 50 people
will send you  $1 with your name at #4.  $50.
 
   -Your 50 new agents make 200 postings each with your name at #3 or 
10,000 postings.  Average return  500 people  = $500.  They make  200
postings  each with  your name  at #2=100,000 postings=5000 return at $1
each=$5000.
 
   -Finally, 5,000 people  make 200 postings with  your name at #1 and 
you get a return  of $50,000 before your  name drops off the list. AND
THATS IF  EVERYONE DOWN THE LINE MAKES 200 POSTINGS! Total income in one
cycle=$55,000.
 
  From time to  time, when you see your name  no longer on the list, 
you 
take the  latest  posting  that appears  in  the newsgroups, and  send
out
another $5,  and put your  name at #5, and start posting again.
Remember, 
200 postings is only a guideline. the more you post, the greater the
return.
 
   Lets review  why  you should do this.  THE ONLY COST IS  $5.  Anyone
can afford $5  for such an effortless investment with such SPECTACULAR
RETURNS.
 
   Some people have said to me,  "what happens if the scheme is played
out
and no one sends me any money?  "Big Deal, so you lose $5-but what are
the
chances of that happening ?? Do you Realize that  NOBODY cares for  the
LEGAL chance  of winning such  a BIG  money as  50,000.00  $$$$ ???? 
and 
all for  a microscopic investment of five  separate dollars? just think
of
all  of the new  Internet users that  join the  net every day!!!
 
   There are  millions of internet  users, and millions  of new net
surfers every  month !!!  This is the  great plus of the Internet, 
people
all over the world can hear you and listen carefully if you  talk
reasonably.  Everyone  will take that chance !  I agree,  If  it wasn't
the  Internet,  and  was a small circle  of people,  the chance 
wouldn't
have  been so small.  the amount of money had to be 200 times bigger, 
and
the chances were zero.  It wouldn't succeed.
 
   But here, on the Internet, it is a giant village,  where new
thousands
of members join in every day ! you CAN'T lose !!!!
 
   Remember- read the instructions  carefully, and play fairly.  That's
the  only way this will  work. Get a printout  so you can refer back to
this article easily.
 
   Try to  keep a  list of  everyone that  sends you  money and always
keep an eye on the  postings to make sure everyone is playing fairly.
You
know where your name should be.
 
   REMEMBER-HONESTY IS  THE BEST  POLICY.  YOU  DO NOT  NEED TO CHEAT
THIS  IDEA TO  MAKE MONEY!!   BESIDES,NOT  PLAYING THE GAME  FAIRLY  IS
ILLEGAL.SO  LET'S  BE  REASONABLE AND  PLAY FAIRLY,SO WE CAN ALL ENJOY
THE
INTERNET GOLD MINE.

GOOD LUCK  FOR YOU ALL, And  remember, play fair  and you'll win,  I
don't
want to mention what might happen to those who won't.   AND  AGAIN,SEE 
YOU NEXT  TIME  WITH SOMETHING  YOU WANTED FOR A LONG TIME !!!

In the tradition of Usenet, where newcomers should receive the benefit
of some personal training as they enter, I'll hand out a couple of
gratuitous suggestions before addressing your question.

Your subject is... a bit harsh, and a bit uninformative.  I'm scanning
over hundreds of subjects as I read through Usenet news.  You
"require" assistance from me?  I don't think so.  Feel free to request
it, but don't require it.  More importantly, it is crucial to put
the... uh... subject of your request into the "Subject:" line.  99% of
the time I won't even read a posting whose Subject line doesn't give
me a lead on what it contains.  A far more useful subject line could
have been: Subject: Help with failure to reset password

Next (and this is why I won't be able to answer your question): we
need to know the details of the platform you're using.  Pine is
available for a bewildering array of machines and operating systems,
each of which is likely to have a different password-setting
mechanism.  Are you running on a Unix host?  Are you running PC Pine?
Are you running on a VAX?  Also important, what version of Pine are
you using?  It's entirely possible that you've stumbled across a known
bug - we'll never know if we can't tell what you're using.  There is
simply no way that we could address your question without knowing
that.

OK, sorry if that all seemed a bit pointed, but a bit of community
ettiquette training should happen to all newcomers at some point.  The
main things to keep in mind when posting a question on Usenet are that
you are _requesting_ help from a community where politeness is valued,
and that community inhabits every sort of computing system in the
world.  You must provide enough information about your own system and
your own problem to let the appropriate people know how to help you.

Best of luck, and welcome to Usenet.

-Dean

Heres an option I would like to see added to pine  -w
which will make the editing behave like pico, no wrap at all.

I find that the wrap often causes problems when subscribing to
listservers, in that the persons name gets wrapped to the next line
then the listserver complains that no name was given on the subscribe

	Hello there! I'm having trouble with my account. My address is:
c673565@showme.missouri.edued before.  I've had this
account since last year
and on Friday it all of a sudden started doing this. I looked to see if
there was a help address and this is what I found. 
	Not only can I not save but it also says that there is a problem
with the disk quota when I'm trying to compose a message. I thought maybe
it was because I had too many files. I decided to go through and delete
some. I deleted about 50+ messages and even some entire files but it still
won't stop. Is there something I'm missing? Could it just be "showme" is
undergoing routine maintenance? I asked other people and nobody has any
clue as to why it is happening.   HELP ME!!!!!

Hello,

Our current confign:

We have an Internet setup with some Personal E-mail Boxes as well as Group
E-mail boxes . 
We have installed PC-PINE 3.94 here, accessing Internet E-Mail  thru a
Solaris Unix box running IMAP .

For Group E-mail boxes , the foll is the confign :

1. HOME=F:\IMAIL           ( Default FCC is in Novell F: drive ) 

For PC-Pine clients, the incoming folder collections include all the
group Inboxes . 

F:\IMAIL dir contains the the folder called "OUTBOX.MTX" contains copy of
all outgoing messages . 

PROBLEM:

1.The folder OUTBOX.MTX on F:\imail seem to be getting corrupted very
often . That means, it can be seen/opened as a TXT file under WIndows but
cannot be recognised as folder by PC-PINE . 
The OUTBOX.MTX is made shareable and delete inhibit . But still , the
individual messages can be deleted . 

2.The Incoming folders need to be made read-only so that nobody (except root)  
can delete messages . 

Tried to search Pine-Information but could not get any solutions. 
Help in any form would be appreciated . 

Thanks & Regds,
Harish

#
# Pine configuration file -- customize as needed.
#
# This file sets the configuration options used by Pine and PC-Pine.  If you
# are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide configuration
# file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments in
# this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about
# specific settings see the section on configuration options in the Pine
# notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.
# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated
# by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a
# continuation of the previous line.  For a variable to be unset its value
# must be blank.  To set a variable to the empty string its value should
# be "".  You can override system defaults by setting a variable to the
# empty string.  Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and
# default to "no".
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Pine.

Date: 14 Oct 1996 05:15:29 GMT
Message-Id: <53si9h$j5p@news4.digex.net>


Colleagues have warned me to limit a Pine distribution list to
100 addresses--I'm told that more than about 100 can result in "problems."
I was wondering, could I create a "superlist" consisting
of three 100-address lists?  Hmmm.  Well, I know I *could*
create such a list, what I need to know is whether it will
work properly if I place the name of the superlist on
the Lcc: line?  Thus getting around the problem of 100
names per list?   :)  Not knowing exactly what is the problem 
with a 100+ name list, it's kind of hard for me to figure
whether a superlist with 300 names would work.

What limitations do I need to be aware of in using Pine
addressbook distribution lists?

Thanks to all.

 First, I gave her the following address:ybaworow@du.edu  but no message

: Do you know of any utility to convert the PINE addressbook into the
: MailDrop addressbook format? (MailConverter 2.2 does this for PINE to
: Eudora, but Eudora doesn't connect to IMAP)

I have since learned that the Mulberry IMAP e-mail client imports a PINE
addressbook, but would still be interested to hear of a stand-alone
utilitya for PINE to Mail Drop.

	The best solution I've seen is mkpgp. There is a link to it on my
PGP-Users Mailing List page (http://pgp.rivertown.net). Once you get this
going, you won't have to bother with pgpsendmail or filters or anything
else. Its Unix only. But have you seen another integration program that, if
it doesn't have a public key for someone will, at your option,
automatically invoke lynx and go to the keyserver to lookup the key and
offer to add it to your keyring? And of course, it free.

  While viewing an e-mail or an article, press "h" to display the full
header.
  Hope this helps.

Hello!

I've seen that problem as well.  I discovered I could avoid it by
being very careful to enter ^r first and then inserting the nickname
on the Lcc: line next--the result is that only the listname appears in the
received mail.

The problem seemed to occur when I first inserted the nickname in
the To: line and then moved it to the Lcc: line.  So when I realize
I've done that, I cancel the message and then carefully insert the
nickname in the Lcc: line, avoiding the To: line altogether.

Hope this helps!

What version of Pine are you using?  There have been bugs in some
older versions that caused failures like this....

The "Out of free storage" message does not have anything to do with
disk usage.  It is triggered when malloc() is unable to allocate more
memory...

    Your request probably cannot be fulfilled.  There is no central
registry of users of Pine (in any country) to begin with.  Also, it is
unclear what you mean by "information of users."  Do you mean
information about individual computer stites which have installed Pine? 
There are probably thousands of them.  Do you mean information about
individual end users of Pine?  There may be possibly hundreds of
thousands of them, and individual information about them may be
considered confidential.

    Perhaps you can give us more specific information on what your
needs are.

Wotcher!

I'm rather fond of Pine and I have a request (or if this already exists,
please tell me how to turn it on):

Should the connection between me and the server misfire, I'd like Pine to
be smart enough to know this and try to re-establish a connection after
the usual 2.5 mins. Right now I seem to have to quit and then log back in
again.

Normally this isn't a problem if I catch it but if I go away from my desk
and then return, I don't always know that the connection has been broken.
Not being able to nuzzle up against the email teat leaves me somewhat sad.

I'm using Pine 3.95 Beta July 15th.

Cheers,
Jules

 Hi,

I try to setup PC-Pine (3.95) and I have a very stupid question:
How can I change the password for the imap-server? The pine.pwd file 
should be encrypted and the Newpassword should work only in UNIX.

My second problem might be the result from no/wrong password.
The INBOX-Folder can't be opened and I get the following error-messages:

Can't connect to sys82,143: Refused (10061)

Find of mailbox outside context

Any help appreciated.

Viktor Groth

There is an option in Pine to change the length of the lines before
word-wrapping. Can you not simply change this to a large number, and then
change it back afterwards?

Our project is looking at using an X.500 server to simplify sending
email (easy to find a user over several different lans etc.)
 
I was wondering how a pine user would take advantage of the availabilty
of the X.500 server?  
 
Would the global addressbook be re-loaded from the server, or can
searching an addressbook (^T) in compose mode quickly access such
a service?

Many thanks - any & all info appreciated.

I am not 100% sure what you mean by this.  pine is a 'command line'
program, but it is run through different screens and whatnot.

I'm guessing you mean can you automatically send a message using pine in a
manner such as this:

cat file | pine -s "The Subject" someone@somewhere.com

or

pine -s "The Subject" -b File_with_the_message.txt someone@somewhere.com

The answer to that is no.

If you want to send files via MIME from the commandline, checkout 'mpack'
(a search in Lycos should point you to it, http://www.lycos.com)

If I want to add a new newsgroup to my list of news folders in pine, what
do I do?  I don't see any kind of function that allows me to see an
expanded list with newsgroups that I am not subscribed to.

Thanks,

     If you are on a UNIX system, simply create a .forward file in your 
     directory that contains the e-mail address of the person to whom your 
     message should be forwarded.  This way, UNIX will forward your 
     regardless of whether or not Pine is running.  I am not sure if Pine 
     can do the forwarding for you.

Is anyone aware of commands to configure pine to automatically forward

Since pine approaches the newsgroups addition question opposite to rn,
in that it only adds newsgroups users tell it to add, some users might
think
pine is more difficult to use than rn.  Not true.  Provided you use a
little strategy.
The effective strategy I found is to think about the topic I'm interested
in reading about.  Next pick one word to describe that topic.
Third, go into newsgroups folder and hit the a to subscribe to a
newsgroup.
Fourth, enter only that single word.  This is done deliberately.
Pine will rightly complain since no newsgroup consists of only one word.
That's great that pine complains, because sometimes it pays to make
mistakes and this is one time you want to do it.
Fifth, hit ^x and tell pine to search for all related newsgroups.
If any are found, just move up and down the list and make your pick.

	Ahhhh.....this is the pine newsgroup.  We don't talk about things
like Eudora.  How are you going to download Eudora anyway?  Isn't she the
mother of Samantha one that old TV show "Bewitched"?  ;-) :-)

Currently you would need to construct a global addressbook from the
X.500 directory.  A conversion script run from cron should work
adequately.  Don't forget to run "pine -create_lu ..." as part of the
conversion procedure.

Yes, we are currently planning to support ACAP in Pine 4.x.  We are
also considering support for LDAP or some other directory service...

I just grabbed the new version of pine and was attempting to upgrade my 
system, but I keep getting errors like this...

[ROOT@tower][/usr/local/src/pine3.95][133]:## build clean
cannot open clean.s.
[ROOT@tower][/usr/local/src/pine3.95][134]:## build lnx
cannot open lnx.s.
[ROOT@tower][/usr/local/src/pine3.95][135]:## 

Where is it looking for clean.s and lnx.s and what are these files?  I 
tried...

[ROOT@tower][/usr/local/src/pine3.95][135]:## touch lnx.s
[ROOT@tower][/usr/local/src/pine3.95][136]:## build lnx

^C
[ROOT@tower][/usr/local/src/pine3.95][137]:##


and build ran for about 20 minutes before I killed the process.

Subject: WARNING: HPUX patch PHSS_8584 breaks pine 3.95
Date: 10 Oct 1996 19:42:47 GMT
Message-Id: <53jjjn$qld@host-04.colby.edu>

Y'all,

   I installed PHSS_8584 (dld.sl cumulative patch, 10.10 s700_800) on my
systems this morning, and I quickly found out that it breaks pine 3.95
on series 700 boxes *only*.  It does not seem to give pine any problems
on s800 boxes.
   The symptoms are thus:  you go into pine, compose a message, and hit
^X to send it.  You then get a complaint about stack overflow and pine
then core dumps.  Analysis of the core dump shows that it croaks at line
6932 of send.c.  Pine is doing a STREAMS operation at that point.
   I would guess that PHSS_8584 may adversely affect other STREAMS code.
I have backed this patch out of all my systems, including the 800 series.
I've reported the problem to HP...

This is from sendmail.  You are not a trusted user according to=20
/etc/sendmail.cf, so the friendly sendmail lets the recipients know
that the sender was changed with an option.

You must talk to the mail administrators to fix this.

    Pine itself will not automatically forward mail for you.  You must
use some task which will process the mail before Pine does anything
with it.  On Un*x systems, this is most commonly done by means of a
.forward file in your home directory.  (I cannot speak about other
operating systems.)

  When you're in the "expanded list" of News Groups (i.e. when you can see
the names of all the News Groups that you've subscribed to), press "a",
which stands for "subscribe to a News Group".
  Then you can enter the keyword that you wanted to search for from the
names of all News Groups carried by your News server. For example,
entering "comp" will list all the News Groups that have the string "comp"
in their names. Then you can subscribe to them.
  Hope this helps.

Followup to my prior post ... "paste" is called (U)ncut in pico, the

    By "compress the mail" I am supposing that you mean mail and/or
news stored in folders after it has already been read.  Correct me if
I am wrong.  (It is possible to filter incoming mail out of the INBOX
and into folders, such as with procmail, but it might be awkward to 
compress these folders when the incoming mail filter process is
potentially always running in the background, so that a folder could
wind up a mixture of compressed and uncompressed.)

    I am not aware of any way to make Pine compress its mail folders
directly.  However, I once saw a script -- which I did not save --
which one would invoke in place of Pine.  It would first uncompress the
folders and then run Pine for you.  After you exited Pine, it would
recompress the folders.  Such a script would have to allow for the
possibility of folders deleted and created during the Pine session.
That script might have been posted on comp.mail.pine, in which case
somebody might be able to provide it.  As I recall, though, it was a
Un*x shell script, and you did not say what operating system you are
using Pine under.  Also, if you're running short of disk space, which
is why you want to compress the folders, be aware that with a script
like this,. for the duration of the time that Pine is running, the
folders would exist in all their expanded glory.

	I just found out how to configure Pine 3.92 for OS/2.  After I 
type in my userid and password to login to the smtp server via Pine I get 
that same error too.

	Let me know what to change so that it doesn't show that error.

In general you can't, because a non-mime-aware mail client will mangle
the headers.

However, if the mail server itself doesn't mangle the headers (internet
mailers normally don't, but if you are behind an X400 gateway or
something then all bets are off), then you just want to leave your
non-compliant mail client out of the game and connect up to the mail
server with a MIME compliant one instead.  Remember, PINE likes IMAP but
it can also play POP.  Those are the Internet standard dialogs between
a mail client (user agent) and a mail server.

When you play POP, you may need to move the offending item back into
your incoming mail folder if it has already been processed and moved
into some other folder.  POP normally only accesses the incoming mail
folder, whereas IMAP can access any mail folder.

Try to keep a clear distinction between the mail server (MTA in the
jargon) and the mail client app.  Many PINE users get confused about
this because they execute PINE on the same host where the server runs,
and they imagine the whole thing (including .forward, and vacation,
and all that stuff) somehow happens inside PINE itself.  Not so.

QUite a few of my users still run VMS MAIL under VMS.  When they get
a MIME mail they tend to rush to me for assistance, and are quite
surprised when I execute PINE on another system and connect it to
their VMS system's mail server to retrieve their mail item.  It's
chiefly a matter of developing the right mental model of what's
going on.  I do my best to explain it to them, but mostly they are
so convinced that the mailing system is all one humungous whole that
then can't see the wood for the trees.  (PINE, geddit?  ;-)

I recently installed Pine on a SCO-Unix system.  It runs fine from
the console port and a telnet connection.

It does run from dumb terminals connected to a Stallion Serial I/O box.
I get the message
Bug in Pine detected: "Select error: Invalid argument"

I am at a loss of what to fix or change.  Any ideas?

	If you "really" want that behaviour you can change the definition
of "#define MAX_FILLCOL     80" in the os.h file.

	What makes you feel anything needs to be converted with binhex?
I saw nothing to indicate that in what you sent.

	If you are wondering about Application/APPLEFILE, and you are
on a PC or UnixBox...then don't worry about it as this is the 
"resource fork" for use on a MAC.

	BTW, in answer to "WHY?"....there are *no* locks on the 7-11

To try to find out what is wrong, it would help if you could let us know:

- Which version of Pine you are using.
- If you compiled Pine yourself on the same SCO system or if you obtained
  a pre-compiled binary.
- The release of SCO you are using (uname -X).
- Exactly which Stallion boxes and host cards you are using.
  Presumably SI, but could also be XIO or RIO (hwconfig).
- Which version of the Specialix drivers you have installed (swconfig).

Maybe this information can be used to provide you with a solution.

Always remember to supply as much information as you can, since the cause
of a problem can come from a seemingly unrelated source. 

Regards,

I have a couple messages in my saved folder. I want to cut sections out of

I've already done that. Pine just says 'Checking for new messages' and
even if there are new ones (marked N) it won't tab to it.

Hi, 

Please help me with a simple problem: how to set the beep/flash for

I am on solaris. Is there any system files can be configured for beeping 
the incoming mails? I can't find configuration about this in pine

  I don't think it's possible.
  If you want to know whether your e-mail has reached the recipient's
server, try the header "Reply-To:".
  If what you suggest is possible, isn't it an invasion of privacy? ;)

Hi,

I am using Pine on a multiuser Unix system. Any email I send with pine
automatically has my email address on the Unix system as the From: address
in the email. Does anyone know if it is possible to change the email
address shown in the From: field to something I choose myself.

Hi pine users,
I installed PCPine 3.95 (winsock version) at our network. We are using
Pathworks 5.0,
windows 3.11 and DEC station 5000/240 (Ultrix 4.3) as file and mail
server. I changed the sendmail version of this Unix machine with 8.7.5 and
it works fine.
I installed pine 3.95 for ultrix from the bin distribution and imapd from
the same version/distribution too.
Pine for Ultrix works fine, but PCPine doesnt send mail and stay at the
moment when it sending. I only can close PCPine with Ctrl-Alt-Del. I saw
that there was an imap process coresponding of my session and there was
sendmail process which tried to get message. Sometimes PCPine stay with
message "waiting 29 seconds for sending" or something about.

Where can be the problem (pcpine, imapd, sendmail), and how can I solve
it?
If someone have the same problems?

Regards

Hi,

Solaris 2.5 SPARC. /var/mail is NFS mounted on a dedicated mail
server.

Problem: About every 10 minutes or whenever I need to write to my
inbox (new mail comes in or deleteing mail) there are error messages
regarding the INBOX and pine aborts and asks to quit and restart. The
error messages include "INBOX length 0 aborting..".."invalid mailbox
format".." unknown error consult an expert".. They all relate to
the inbox and it appears the inbox is being written too when it should not
be.

I have tried:

o Diffrent versions of pine
o removing all .pinerc, .pine-conf, .pine-debug? and restarting
o removing sent-mail and .addressbook*
o running pine directly on the mail server (no NFS)
o deleteing the INBOX to 0 length
o running from a bare shell (no .login .profile .csh)
0 creating a new account and forwarding mail to that account. the new
  account works on so the mail headers are fine.
0 watching the creation of /usr/mail/stephen.lock is created and deleted
  when the inbox is needed to be written too. verified ok.

Im at a loss. This problem is not effecting anyone else but me. What other
files does pine open/use? Any help appreciated.

I have used pine for 4 years and support a network of 6000 users using
pine and have never seen this problem before. I have looked at it for 3
days to no avail, it is effecting my personal account only.

Well, sorry about the suggestion. I was replying from home, where I
don't have access to the pine help file. Silly me, I know. It is nice to
know that I was getting close, though.

But, does this mean that even if one can invoke "pico -w" as an
alternative editor, pine will still restrict the line length to 80 or less
characters after composing, unless the program is reconfigured 
(recompiled?). I would try these, if I could, but unfortunately I don't
have access to do so, and PCPine won't let me use an alternate editor.

Yours

Hi there,

I have a problem with sending email in pine. For some reason, some email
addresses take a very long time (sometimes 1 or 2 minutes) to send a
message to. I press ^X, en it says "sending email", and I have to wait for
1 minute before I can proceed. The messages are not long, that doesn't
matter.

Does anybody know how I can let pine do this in the background?? So that I
can read/send other email?

Regards,
Koen.

I presume you mean "I    INDEX LIST"...

You can do this by making pine have a single initial key stroke, which
should be a single up arrow. The code for this keystroke is "UP" (lower
case "up" also seems to work. Either go to "setup" "configure" and look
for "initial-keystroke-list". Make the entry there just read "UP" (or
"up"; both without the quotation marks). Alternatively, start pine with
the following command: 

	pine -I up

Both work with PCPine, I haven't tried with other versions.

PS: The information available in the help for "initial-keystroke-list" was
how I discovered the above.

Yours

Most definitely not, that is the same as always answering Yes.

You want read-message-folder.

  It seems that you're running 2 copies of Pine simultaneously. That
usually results in the error message you mentioned.
  Try to quit all Pine instances and start 1 copy of Pine.
  Hope this helps.

Hi,

I wonder whether there's a way to have a hierarchical folder tree for
pine (in unix) ? Using a flat file scheme, where all the folders are
in one directory (eg: $HOME/mail) complicates the task of somehow
controlling and organzing these folders.

I was trying to Following-Up to a news article and got the following:

[Error posting message: 441 Article not posted -- more included text than
new text]

I understand what this means, but it doesn't seem right. Isn't it
reasonable that sometimes a follow-up would be shorter than the original
text. Do other news tools enforce the same restriction ?  Is there any way
of turning this off in Pine ?

	This has already been asked/answered a few times this past week
or two.  On U*IX systems the .forward file is the method of choice.
Try "man forward" or "man sendmail" for more information.

	In some private email we had....you asked about forwarding from
a VAX.  The email I sent you bounced since your .forward file on the
above account must have been set incorrectly.  (I didn't save the error).
I don't speak VAX...but maybe others on the list do?

To set up mail forwarding for a VAX/VMS system (so that arriving mail gets
redirected elsewhere)...

1.  Login to the VAX.
2.  Start MAIL.
3.  Give the mail program the command:
	SET FORWARD=xxxxx
    where xxxxx is the e-mail address you want mail redirecting to
4.  EXIT to get out of mail

Other useful mail commands:
	SHOW FORWARD
	SET NOFORWARD

(All this is actually descibed within VAX MAIL if you type "HELP"!)

Word of caution: VAX/VMS systems usually _don't_ use standard Internet
addresses for e-mail addresses.  I am presuming you know how to use such
addresses on your system.  If not you will need to ask advice locally, as
it depends what mail gateway software has been installed on the computer.

Cheers,

This may be true.

Note however that the message is not referring simply to the size of your
reply article compared with the original article, but is actually
referring to the proportion of "new" text _within_ your reply article
compared with the amount of "old" text you included and quoted.

> Do other news tools enforce the same restriction ?

This check is not performed by Pine or any other news reading program that
I'm aware of.

Instead it is an option of the news server that you are connecting to.

The news reading program (in this case Pine) is simply reporting to you
the error message returned to it by the news server software as it
attempted to post your article.

> Is there any way
> of turning this off in Pine ?

No (it isn't Pine; see above).  Instead you will have to try beating your
News Administrator over the head with a wet kipper and see if they can be
persuaded to turn the check off on the news server software itself.

Again.....kindly consult your man pages about the .forward facility
of sendmail.....

You will find the .forward file can contain:

This isn't Pine's task. Use a pipe in your ~/.forward file (on Un*x) to
forward your mail. If you have different conditions for delivering mail
then use the procmail package and call procmail in your ~/.forward file.
Then your mail handling conditions can be written in descriptive form in
a file named ~/.procmailrc

Hope this helps.

Hi,

In my former school I use the elm and the pine program for reading my
mail.
But now I can only read mail in the elm and not in the pine.
I could only send mail in pine. How does that come? What should I
do if I want to read mail and get the mail in pine?

thanks

Message-Id: <3264e1f6.216459@nnrp.usc.edu>

Is there a way to change the default newgroup header columns so that
instead of displaying msg number, date, author and subject I could
transpose author and subject? My goal is to get more of the subject
line
and less information on the author.

Thanks. I have searched the archives of this newsgroup and also the
FAQ
but cannot find an answer to this question.

There is certainly a way (in Pine 3.95) of changing the format of the
Index screens.  However be warned that it will affect all your Index
screens, including those of your INBOX and mail folders.

To read about/do it...

1.  At Pine's Main Menu type "S" then "C" to go to the Setup Configuration
    screen.

2.  Look down the list of configurable options for "index-format" (down
    near the bottom).

3.  Put your cursor on this line and type "?" to see the built-in help for
    this item.

This should get you started.

Cheers,

Hi,
 I am a freshman at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois,
and I am wondering if there is any way you can search for addresses of
people who attend other colleges including those in other states. If
anyone has an answer to this, e-mail me at: awyant@sun.iwu.edu. I would
greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

Hello,

I just built and installed Pine 3.95 on a MkLinux machine.  (MkLinux, for
those that aren't familiar, is a native Linux port to PowerPC Macs, but for
all intensive purposes of this question, treat it as an x86 Linux
equivalent)

When any user runs Pine, it gives the following message:
   [Mailbox is open by another process, access is readonly]
But there is no obvious process contention present.

The permissions for /var/spool/mail are drwxrwxrwt, and each user owns
their own spool file.    I'm running sendmail 8.7.4 in daemon mode. (-bd)

The funny thing is that other mail programs, namely elm, work absolutely
fine.  So does popper, even clearing the spool when finished.

Help!

Many thanks,
Enrico

There has been at least one other similar request recently. However,
Pine does not have a straightforward way of doing this. What you need
to do is look at each of those messages and export them into a file,
and then, when composing the new message, read in the file and use
mark (ctrl^ to set a mark followed by cursor movement to mark text)
and cut to remove those parts you do not want, or mark and paste to
move those parts that you want to move. A nice sophistication is to
'view' the message first before export (save). This way you will not
save the headers, if you do not want to subsequently have to remove
them.

Yours

Gregor

It is.  It just isn't a GOOD one.  Great for mail, though.  And pico is a
fine text editor.  Try tin for news.

Hi,

once again the same question: how can I read the mail of another user in
the same system? I run the AIX 4.1, and I have three accounts. I would
like to read mail from all the accounts starting single Pine.

Perhaps there is a problem with NFS locking.
Generally, it is not a very good idea to have a mailbox imported via NFS.
Do other users have similar problem?

It is not usually possible to change the From: field. This appears to be
generally considered to be good for reasons of security and propriety. In
any case, why do you want to change it? What are you trying to hide? I can
think of no (legitimate) reason to do so. Would you send a letter and
write a false return address on it? If you were to receive snail mail with
an obviously or not so obviously false address, would you do more than
puzzle at it? In any case, even if you could change it, it might not do
much good. At this site, at least, the From: field is stripped by sendmail
_after_ Pine has dealt with it, so that the address conforms to
user@domain. There are obvious security considerations here. 
 
I am aware that some (but not me) would insist on the possibility of
anonymity, but I ask you again: what would you do if you receive an
anonymous letter? (... on the other hand, there is a tradition in England
of sending anonymous love letters on Saint Valentine's day ...). 

What about taking somebody's mail to the Post Office and putting it in the
mailbox? Well, it apears that you can't do that with Pine either. But,
what you can do is ask your recipient(s) to reply to someone else, or

Subject: Fonts under PC-Pine??
Date: 16 Oct 1996 14:00:50 GMT
Message-Id: <01bbbb6a$e9fcffe0$243f0298@newton>

Hello,
I've recently started using PC-Pine 3.95 under NT 4.0.  I like the client,
but I can't seem to get the program to see more than a few fonts (Courier,
Fixedsys, Lucida Console), none of which look very good.

Could someone explain why this happens and (hopefully) how to get more
fonts to show up?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!

Chris

	Of course the "messages off" has nothing to do with email
messages.  It has to do with the ability of another user on the
system using "write" to "talk" to their termial.

	Check your setup/config for the state of the "allow-talk" option.
Reading the help is a good lesson as well.

	In addition, it is possible that the account is set such that
messages are turned off by default.  Check the man page on the "mesg"
command.  Issue the "mesg" command from the command line.  If messages
are turned off...you can enable them with the same command.  You can
add the command to your .profile, .login, or .cshrc....or whatever
startup file makes sense.

	Regards,

		Ed

I'm a diehard pine fan since '94. So, whenever pine comes
put with a new verison I download it and build it on my Linux pc.

Now for some reason, I can't seem to get pine 3.95 to build on 
my system. The funny thing is, Pico and Pilot always compile
perfectly when I try to build it from these new sources!

At first, I thought it wanted to be built as an ELF binary by
an ELF compiler and so forth BUT if that ere true, why would 
Pico and Pilot always compile perfectly????

I'm currently running a DX4100 pc with 20 megs-o-ram! I intend
to upgrade to a Pentium 133 or 166 with 32 megs in about a week
or so. And I really wanted to have pine 3.95 for my new sys.

Can anyone please help??

Signed,

JED the pine fanatic!

**BTW, If this is a dumb question, please excuse the fact that I may
**have overlooked something obvious, ok?

Date: 16 Oct 1996 21:37:44 GMT
Message-Id: <543kj8$5s1@vixen.cso.uiuc.edu>

Hi there... I have a slight problem... actually more of an annoyance.

Is there any way to change the from field within pine to something else.
I realize why this has been made difficult to change, but here is my situation.

My host name is tri0002.urh.uiuc.edu. But it isn't mine to keep. It may change
at any given moment. Most likely it won't, but regardless, I use a email
redirector at uiuc.edu that resloves to my email address at my computer.

Basically, my mail then looks like this:
From: kolak@tri0002.urh.uiuc.edu
Reply-To: kolak@uiuc.edu

While this works, there are mailers that don't respect the Reply-To field, and
then it is still up to the people to chose to use the reply-to field.

Any help is appreciated.

Ryan

Do you mind to recompile?

Find the pine/osdep/os-xxx.h file of you choice and look for:

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Define this if you want to allow the users to change their From header
   line when they send out mail.  The users will still have to configure
   either default-composer-hdrs or customized-hdrs to get at the From
   header, even if this is set.
 ----*/
/* #define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM  /* comment out to not allow changing From
*/

Hi , Thank you very much for your Email , I guess i didn't explain my self
good in my first email , so i understand your reply , and the way you
talked about Hide, anonymous ,security etc...

well i'll Explain now .

I am a SysAdmin in a Big ISP Internet provider (netvision.net.il) , in my
department we support customers using Email.
well i am responsible about these issues - bigmail , bigftp, news,system,
So when i want to send mail to a customer i can't every time to login to
other mailbox and send the mail from there , for example
i want to send mail to a customer that have a bigmail in his mailbox 
so i send it as bigmail@netvision.net.il ...
and if i want to send it as news support , so i send using
news@netvision.net.il , and all the other mail support are the same.
I hope that you understand me now , this problem with Pine is not My only
problem all my department suffer from this issue.
becouse when i send a message using my computer , the client send back the
email " using my address ", my private email.
the truth is that my friend using now elm becouse there is an option Group
reply , and you can send the mail using any Mail List You want.
I tried to add the Reply-to option but the customers keep sending mail to
my private Name .!!
I Hope now i explained my problem and you understand that i am not a Kid
who want to make Fun and send anonymous emails.
Please if there any program or special way to solve this issue . We need
IT.

Thanks again for your Email. And i hope our problem can be solved.

Why don't you add .forward file in your multi-accounts so that all
emails will finally go to only one account?

Good luck.

Since your user name stays the same, you could consider changing your
user-domain in the configuration screen. Putting the value "uiuc.edu" in
user-domain will effectively change the From: header to "kolak@uiuc.edu".

You will notice that an extra header will be added to your message: 
"X-Sender: kolak@tri0002.urh.uiuc.edu". The original sender therefore
remains preserved, but the change in From: should give you what you want. 

Be aware that this option will also effect all unqualified addresses! 
That is, a message plainly sent to "root" will no longer go to the root
account on your local system, but to "root@uiuc.edu" instead!

Hope this helps.

Yes, I am in essentially the same situation.  Is there some way to instruct 
PINE to use a different "From:" address?

I have noticed two changes while using Pine lately:
a) Mac Control-C is no longer effective for cancelling messages.  Someone
already told me to use esc-esc-C (which works).

b) I have not been able to successfully receive/download a document that
is  created in MSW for Mac and sent as an attachcment from an account in
AOL. For months I had no problem.  Now when I download using Eudora I get
the message in five parts, nothing in the attachement directory.

Also, I saved the message into a Pine folder when it came in for the
fourth time and the saved message shows no attachement and does not
contain any text other than the cover note.  The sender insists nothing
has "changed" at his end.  Since the message I saved in Pine (and then
undeleted) was the one I used this morning to get my latest five part
message in Eudora I am mystcfied as to what saving the message did to all
that data that I got when I opened it using Eudora.

The only thing I can think of at this end is that I remember a notice
about Pine being "upgraded" recently at CNC.  I understand from reading
the FAQ sheet posted in the Pine Update server that there is strategy
for combining the 5 e-mails which have ended up in my Eudora In Box.

BUT, that seems to be going backwards in terms of compatability across
platforms, etc.

Also, the two changes I have noticed at this end, one totally unrelated to
MIME, etc. makes me think the "problem" is at this end.  I hope the
problem is not totally " between my ears."

Any particular reason you're asking this in the Pine mailer newsgroup,
rather than comp.mail.eudora.mac or comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows?

You might want to try <URL:http://www.eudora.com>.

Recently my college changed to pine, and I have approximately 20 folders
with mail messages in the previous system.  Is there any way to transfer a
complete folder with its messages to my pine account, or must I mail
myself each message individually, one folder at a time, and create a new
folder in pine?

E-mail wouldn't be very secure if you could read other's e-mail ... but what 
you can do is, once you log into one account, type

        su username

assuming AIX works the same as other UNIX flavors.  You'll have to give the 
other user's password.  But then you'll be able read that user's mail in pine.

Hi to you all. I am wondering how I would find out the e-mail addresses 
of some of my friends in other states.  If someone could explain...please 
e-mail me.  Thanks a ton!

Hello all: Help

In all outgoing mail pine includes Message-ID into the header and (for
Mime-encoded attachments) Content-ID into the header and attachment.
E.g.
  Content_ID: <Pine.LNX.3.95.961017144020.19036A-101000@lvb04.ife-le.de> 
where lvb04 is the hostname.

We want to delete all hostname information from mails.

Deleting such lines from header can be done by sendmail, but Content-ID
from attachments?

Is it possible to configure or compile Pine so that Pine does'nt include
the ID-lines?

Rudolf

It has been suggested here that you first export the two messages and
then read in them into a third, and cut what you don't want. Can be a
mess, if the messages in question are long and the wanted sections are
rather short...
I prefer to use the screen capture function in my terminal program. I
append marked regions one by one to a file in my PC hard-disk, and then
read in that file to the new message. Check your terminal program for
this useful function.

Another option is to select the messages of interest and then do "afn"
(apply-forward-no), then edit you the pieces you don't want.

Hallo,
how can I send the same message again without rewriting the text after
failing of the transmission because of a wrong address.

I have a number of users who use pc pine on there workstations here on campus,
then go home and use unix pine from there, and some even have laptops with 
pc-pine.  Is there anyway to synchronize users data like the personal addressbook?

Hi,

I am starting a moderated mailing list using majordomo. At the moment all
the messages are coming in with a BOUNCE subject line. I have to manually
strip the old headers and add an approved line. 
Is there anyone with any experience on this out there? I could really use
a smart send filter to do this for me.

Thanks,

Simon.

One quick way to access the INBOX of different accounts you have (whether
they are on the same host or on different hosts) is to "GOTO folder" and
then specify

	{hostname}

where hostname is the name of the host the account is on; so, for example:

	{info.wcss.wroc.pl}

Each time (in my experience ;) you will be prompted for your username and
password, so you can access different accounts even on the same host. 

You can also set up multiple incoming folders, which is handy if you do
this repeatedly; see the help screen for enable-incoming-folders in Pine's
SETUP CONFIGURATION screen.

One thing to remember when accessing mailboxes on other accounts/hosts,
however, is that -- if you reply to or forward messages stored there --
that email will still be "From" the account you used to start Pine.

	Two ways have been suggested in the past:

1.	Go to the outbox and use the "forward" function.  You need to
	edit appears on the screen to change the appearence so it
	doesn't look like a forwared message...and then send it.

2.	Got to the outbox and save the message to the postponed folder.
	Then, when you type c, pine will ask if you want to continue
	postponed message.  Say yes, fix the address, and send.

Not yet, unless you have the ability to mount your Unix home directory
as a PC drive (e.g. via NFS or SMB).

But better support for this is planned.

Since Pine does not make it easy to add an Approved header line to
selected messages on the fly, probably you want to use the method
where the first line of text has the Approved command.

Majordomo ("resend" actually) expects the forwarded headers to be the
next nonblank line under the Approved command.  Pine however puts in
this extra line:

---------- Forwarded message ----------

It would be sufficient to remove that, and then Majordomo will pick up
the headers off the original message.  You don't need to remove them.

You can also make a small change in the resend file.  Line 145 is
where it ignores blank lines until it gets to the headers:

           if (/^\s*$/) {

You could change it to :

           if (/^\s*$/ || /.*-----.*/) {

and then resend will also ignore a line with 5 hyphens in a row.  I
did it this way because another mail program we use also puts in some
hyphens and this takes care of both.  Then all you have to do is
forward the message with the Approved command in the first line, and
leave the rest as is.

Hmmm... looks like we need to update that section to include the 
(semi-recent) addition of /user= syntax, e.g. 

  {info.wcss.wroc.pl/user=joe}inbox

Particularly handy when defining an incoming-folder list.

We recently upgraded to Pine 3.95 from 3.93 on SCO 3.2v4.2.

Before, when we are e-mailing, if we typed in a wrong user name, it would
popped out an error about the username not correct or something like that.
But I just noticed that if I typed in anything that is not in the
addressbooks now, it would append our domain name to the end and attempt
to send it.

I looked through the tech-notes and found this
"compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs" which looks like what I need to use.
But it was there already in our pine.conf.fixed, but it is not catching
the wrong usernames.

Am I looking at the correct feature or is there somewhere else that I have
to set to catch the wrong usernames?

TIA,

Johnny

Maybe you could post some detailed information such as what make and/or the
compiler reported when it wouldn't build.  FWIW, I had no problems compiling
pine, pico, or pilot under Linux 2.0.0 (Slackware 3.1) on a 486dx2/66 with 4
megabytes of RAM.

Subject: Another IMAP client (not PINE) ?
Date: 17 Oct 1996 19:39:20 GMT
Message-Id: <546218$14qd@zeus.ucab.edu.ve>


	Here in the UCAB, we have 2 mail servers; a RS/6000 running
AIX with PINE as mail client, and a PC server with Lotus cc:Mail. The
multiples disavantages of having 2 mail systems (mainly, trying to
maintain a coherent list of users in both systems, the
incompatibilities, like cc:Mail not supporting MIME, etc.) have
decided us to move to a unified UNIX enviroment for mail. Given the
nature of the service we offer (big "computer laboratories" for public
use, not a stable user-machine relation), we found an IMAP mail system
a good alternative. Problem is, switching all cc:Mail users to PC-Pine
will seem to them like a downgrade (they find even cc:Mail interface
"complex and difficult"). There is a good Windows IMAP
client with a graphical interface? Something that don't leave

This assumes that the host is running IMAP service and that
pre-authenticated (rsh) connections are not used.  If you have
configured /etc/rimapd as a link to the imapd executable and have
.rhosts configured in each account, you can open the INBOX for user
foo with

	{hostname/user=foo}INBOX

An IMAP server is included in the Pine source distribution, or you can
get source from

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

If everything is on one system, you may get some performance benefit
using

	{localhost/user=foo}INBOX

Good luck!

Every time I press Q to quit Pine, Pine asks me if I want to move all read
messages to another folder.  If I don't press N then, it does that, and
sets all the messages in my inbox as deleted.

This drives me nuts.  I keep on coming close to deleting all my messages.
I have investigated the Pine setup/config screen, and I can't find what is
causing this.  Any help?

I'm guessing that what you're trying to do is save yourself a keystroke, so you
can just hit ENTER to see the index of your INBOX.  If I'm right, then you can
do the same thing from the Main Menu by just hitting "i" regardless of where the
pointer is located.  There's another, even better step-saver:  Go into
Setup/Config, find the option that says "initial-keystroke-list" and add the
value "i" to the right of the equals sign.  Now when you start Pine you'll
bypass the Main Menu all together, and be placed directly in the INBOX.

Subject: Named pipe for .sig ignored?
Date: 13 Oct 1996 15:34:31 GMT
Message-Id: <53r267$n7h@NNTP.MsState.Edu>

I am trying to play some tricks with my .signature file by making it
a named pipe in order to generate a new .sig each time.  (I am trying
to use the "planner" package I picked off the net.)

For some reason, pine seems to be refusing to read the .signature file
if it is a named pipe.  It works just fine (i.e., a new signature is
fed in each time the .signature is read) with other mail progs such
as 'mail', 'elm', and all others I tried.

I will appreciate if anyone could tell me how to get around this
problem.  BTW, please feel free to flame me if this has been asked plenty
many times before; our news server stores only about 200 latest articles :(

					Thanks.

Hello, I really like using pico and I want it on my machine; however, due
to the fact that sendmail has been kinda flimsy --but works now- I dont
want to mess with it in any way by installing another mailer...Can I just
install pico? If yes, how?

Thank you

Date: Fri, 18 Oct 1996 11:44:14 +0900
From: Jonathan Berman <berman@u-aizu.ac.jp>

Hello,

I am now located in Japan and my account here does not have PICO.  I always 
liked that editor, its small, easy, quick, and does exactly what I want it to 
do.  

Is it possible for me to get a copy of PICO and install it onto my own 
personal account for my personal use (I am referring to copyright concerns).  
I am pretty familiar with UNIX and think I can install it with no problems.  
I've been searching for a copy of PICO for two days now, if possible can I get 
the address where I can FTP it.  

Thank you,



Jon

	Yes, you can install you own personal copy.

	You want source, compiled binaries???

	ftp ftp.cac.wasington.edu

	cd pine

	cd unix-bin

Try this ... not sure if it will help but some ***ix servers are fussy
about case sensitive context: 

When I queried your server for your address it told me you were:

yu105816@yorku.ca  ... Not ...

yu105816@Yorku.CA

Mayhaps not the cause of your problem, but one never knows.  Hope this

It looks like "build" on your system invokes some other program that deals
with assembly language(?) files.  Try "./build" instead.

Hmmm... Well done for looking at the Setup Configuration screen.

However it's a shame you didn't spot the two variables which I think are
causing your difficulties; they are listed in the first few lines of the
screen:

read-message-folder      = <No Value Set>       <----
	...
feature-list             =
            Set        Feature Name
            ---   ----------------------
            [ ]  allow-talk
            [ ]  assume-slow-link
            [ ]  auto-move-read-msgs            <----

If "read-message-folder" is set to a folder name then Pine will *ask* you
whether you want all read messages moving to it as you close the INBOX (by
quitting Pine).

If you want this to happen *without* being asked then you need to turn on
the "auto-move-read-msgs" feature.

If you don't want this to happen at all (and so leave your read messages
sitting in your INBOX) then make sure that "read-message-folder" is unset
(or set to "" if your System Administrator has set up a systemwide default
folder name).

The actions of both variables are describd in Pine's built-in help which
you can see by putting the cursor on the variable name and typing "?".

Cheers,

	From the m(ain) menu....go to the i(ndex)....and type
?(help).  And *read*.

	This is called "Information Research".  

	Look at the bottom of your screen.  You will either find ?(help)
or ^G(Get help).

In the Index screen (where you see these letters) type a "?" to get to
Pine's built-in help.  Have a read of this, particularly the section a
little way down which starts:

  STATUS: The markings on the left side of the message tell you about its
  status.  You may see one or more of the following codes on any given
  message:

Cheers,

I have a question to ask.  Please humor me.  How do you transfer messages
that you have already received to the "saved-messages" box in the Folder

This is not a bug-report. I just want to find out means to configure 
my PINE settings in a particular way.

Q.   Is there any way to let PINE use user-name other than the one from
     the /etc/passwd file ?

o    When I compose any e-mail using PINE, it automatically takes the user
     name from the "/etc/passwd" file and appends @ followed by the domain
     name specified under "user-domain"to form the "From" field of the
     e-mail.

o    I understand that the "Reply-To" field can be used for that purpose.
     But when the mail bounces back due to any reason it bounces back to
     the "From" address instead of the "Reply-To" address.

o    Please e-mail the solution to sbhandarkar@mcimail.com

Thanks
Suresh

Subject: Pine 3.95 has trouble creating lock file
Message-Id: <Pine.LNX.3.95.961018223916.229A-100000@obgyn.mssm.edu>
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi.  I upgraded from Pine 3.91 to Pine 3.95 on a Linux system tonight.
I installed the pre-compiled Linux/ELF versions of Pine 3.95, Pico 2.9,
and imapd 7.8(100) from the washington.edu ftp site.

Pine 3.95 *seems* to work, except that when it is invoked by a user other
than root, it briefly displays an error message on starting: "Error
creating /var/spool/mail/goofy.845962142.184.obgyn.mssm.edu: permission
denied".

Pine 3.91 didn't (and still doesn't -- I kept a copy) have this problem.

The directory /var/spool/mail is owned by root:mail, mode 775.

I can't figure out why Pine 3.95 should have trouble creating a lock file
in this directory, especially since Pine 3.91 doesn't have.  I can't find
any reference to this problem in any of the documentation I've been able
to get my hands on.

Can anybody help?

Thanks,
-jon

Yes, Mark Crispin could.  His reply to my message the Pine support team
followed the robot-generated
"we'll-do-our-best-but-don't-count-on-a-reply-in-the-near-future" message
by about two minutes -- not *quite* fast enough to catch me before I
posted my problem here.

A simple 'chmod 1777 /var/spool/mail' did the trick.  (Evidently, Pine
3.91 also couldn't create the lock file, but it didn't bother reporting
it.)

It is near the top. I just checked and it appears to be in 3.91
which you are using, although that is now an old version.

Delete the setting and things should hopefully get better..

I don't use Pine for news reading, but I think the "index-format" option under
Setup/Config will prove helpful.  Scroll down to that option and hit "?" for
extensive, useful information.  I don't know if there's a way to set a different
index format for newgroups vs. mail folders.

Dear Pine Users:

Does Pine has a "receipt" function which enables you to check 
if your email recipient has received your email?  If so, 
please tell me how to set up.  If not, is there any way to 
emulate this?  TIA.

If you're using Pine 3.95, check out the Setup/Config option called
"alt-addresses."  It does just what you want; each user should enter his/her
alias as an "alt-address" to have Pine recognize it as a valid address for
him/her.

You want the "Return-Reciept-To:" line in the header of your out-going
mails.  You can add such lines in the setup configuration (s, c) under
"customized-hdrs".  I have two such lines:

	Return-Receipt-To:
	Reply-To:

You can do it!

This doesn't work for me. The only thing I can do to prevent the first
person on the list from appearing in the "To" field is to go in and edit
the field manually. This is a pain. I think it's a bug in Pine. Anyone else
have this problem?

Yep, I finally found it.  Unfortuately by the value it says "Value is 
fixed".  Try to change it and it says "Can't add to sys-admin defined value".

Hello, 

couple questions

please direct me to info on 'enable background sending' & 'compose send
offers first filter'

I'd like to set up a file similar to signature, but that does some
auto-reply work ... such as "thanks for your message/mail, i'll reply
soon" etc.  or similar to the 'vacation forwarding' but on a daily basis.

I'm guessing the above is a possible choice???

I have noticed some problems with 3.95 when upgrading from 3.94,

Sometimes pine comes up with Access Error, closing mail box.. and Error
reading mail box, closing.

Does anyone get this on the Solaris 2.5 binary/platform or on any other OS?

I use few accounts in order to separate email regarding different
aspects of my work. E.g. one of my accounts is for administering
listservers only, the onother one for all the stuff regarding contacts
with my supercomputer users etc.

    There should be online help screens for these.  Have you checked
them?

    No.  Pine cannot do this in its current incarnation.  You really
seem to be folding two things into one -- auto-reply and a variable
signature.  They are not the same thing at all.  Pine cannot do either,
but under Un*x and Un*x-like systems, something like procmail can do
auto-reply.  (You have to be careful setting it up, though.)  Variable
signature is a whole different kettle of fish.

Try ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed/pico-bin.ostype.Z

where ostype is linux, solaris, sun, etc.  ...or download /pine/pine.tar.gz
and only compile pico.

people without giving the original addressees the same message again. Is
this possible? Thanks...Norm

Is it possible to set Pine up so that wherever I am online (ie. telnet) 
there is notification of new mail (ie. a beep or a notice flashed on the

	Two ways have been suggested in the past:

1.	Go to the outbox and use the "forward" function.  You need to
	edit appears on the screen to change the appearence so it
	doesn't look like a forwared message...and then send it.

2.	Got to the outbox and save the message to the postponed folder.
	Then, when you type c, pine will ask if you want to continue
	postponed message.  Say yes, fix the address, and send.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi All,

I asked this question (or a similar) a while ago, but got no response.

I use pine for reading news, at least at the moment. I also currently
sign all my postings. I'd like to be able to automatically stop it
from doing this for a couple of groups, either as part of my default
filter, or possibly in an external script (such as the sendmail.sh
script I currently using for mail).

(All I _really_ need is someway to get at the message _with_ its
headers, or at least to modify the body knowing which newsgroups it's
going to)

Has anyone any suggestions about this?

I'm running Linux (and hence Unix pine, 3.95), FWIW.

Cheers,
aj

	If you are running a single telnet session to a host and your are
not running pine then pine is not running.  i.e. it is not capable of
telling you that new mail has arrived.

	If you have a shell account and/or depending on how your are
connected there may be ways to accomplish what you seek.  However, without
telling folks more about your environment it would be difficult to
speculate.

Note: Please relpy to me directly also so I do not have to read this intier
list for several days. (sorry too much mail).

I have 10 ultra-sparcs that are used for remote dialin services. There are
upwards of 900 people logged in to these machines during the day.  They seem
to have a propensity for logging off by shuting down their serial
connection. When this happens while in pine it dumps core, usually somewhere
in ttyin.c. I saw a couple select() errors and lots of pine-debug? files
with this:
....
    ---- MAIN_MENU_SCREEN ----
about to end_tty_driver
Pine Panic: Select error: Invalid argument

So after removing 15 gigs of core files (40,000 users) it seemed prudent
to turn off deliberate core dumping in pine to try and maintain some free
disk space....

I tried to compile without -DDEBUG as that is what your coredump() routine
is wrapped in, but pine would then not run when started as "xterm -e pine".
The errors flash by too quick to see before the xterm vanishes.

Anyhow I changed #ifdef DEBUG to #ifdef DEBUG_CORE around that call to the
coredump routine with out any problems.

Does "The Team" have any feel on where the "#ifdef DEBUG" is blowing up?
Or if there are known problems in ttyin.c?

Thanks,
Randall

I am a student at UW and therefore have a Pine account and access all of
my E-Mail through tinalew@u.washington.edu

Iv'e noticed that I also have Netscape Mail from the software I obtained
through school.  Is there a way that I can set up Netscape mail to send
pages to my E-Mail account?

When I try now I get a message that says "Netscape is unable to lacate
the server:  pop the server does not have a DNS entry.  Check the server
name in the loacation {URL} and try again."

Do you have any advice for me?

I am running PC-Pine 3.95 on my home computer (Win95). I can print messages

my addressbook. Any suggestions? Is this an isolated problem on my machine
or has someone else experienced this.

I tried this. Doesn't work. I am running 3.95 now. and I get the error
message that says that I can't change the field. You mentioned that the
system admin may have changed this option. well, I am the sys admin of my
own machine and would make the change. I could hack the code, but I would
have to find time. Anybody know if is possible?

True.  Real viruses apart, I guess we now have to contend with 
"meta-viruses" such as these.  Cool, we now have a new buzzword!

Exactly.  I checked in my Setup/config screen in Pine, and the above=20
option was not checked off, so it couldn't be causing any effect.

Unfortunately I can't find such an option on the config screen.  It is=20
nowhere to be found.  Nothing on that screen in fact explains my=20
problem.  So I don't know where to look to see what is causing the=20
behaviour.  All I know is that all other accounts I've used, Pine has=20
never acted this way.

Where did you save it?  Did you save it inside Pine (in a folder)?  Or did
you extract the mail into a file?

There is not enough information to address kermit here.  What happened and
what didn't happen?  What error message, if any, did you have?  What a
connection did you have?  What terminal emulation software did you use?

Oops. I forgot that in pine, this method works only when the sections to
be captured are less than one screenful in extension. This is because in
pine, the text does not continuosly flow from top-of-screen into the
terminal program's screen memory buffer (or whatever this is called).
What if you want to capture more? You can export your files, and scroll
them on screen (cat, in unix). Or switch to elm.

In order to allow changing the From field as described below, you have to 
modify some include file before compiling pine (it is the OS dependend file 
for your system).

BTW, more detailed information on this issue can be found somewhere in the 
documentation ;-) In case you cannot find it, drop me an e-mail.

cd into pine3.95/pine/osdep/ then edit os-XXX.h where XXX is your os type
(ie. I use Linux, so it would be os-lnx.h) and enable ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM.

I'm logged in as root on my own system right now, using an e-mail account
through my ISP, so here's your proof.  Once you recompile, you will be able
to add a "From: whoever@wherever.com" to custom headers.

If the VMS system is running an IMAP server, you can install the
imapmove/imapcopy program on your Unix system and pull the messages
over that way.  See ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

That's the right feature...  Check your .pine-debug1 file to verify that
Pine is seeing the pine.conf.fixed file.

You can also use Pine's PIPE "|" command in conjunction with the "free
output" suboption to pass a message to "cat" or whatever.

I subscribed to a newsgroup using pine 3.93. The menu says to use "D" for
delete to unsubscribe. When I did that, pine says I have unsubscribed and
the newsgroup disappears from my list of newsgroups in pine. When I go
away and then come back, the unwanted newsgroup has reappeared with all of
its 400+ messages. How can I get that newsgroup to stay unsubsribed?

Go to setup configuration and set it (s, c).  Do a "?" if doubt.  You are
using Pine, aren't you?   ... :-)

Hi...

I have a question about the "reply-to" feature in pine.
When I opt to include the original message in my
e-mail it starts right below the "Message Text" bar.

This is very annoying as then I have to manually insert
lines so I can type in my reply above the original message.

I'm using crosstalk for windows to access the shell.  Not
running PPP using telnet to access pine.   Pretty cut and
dried.

I'm thinking that there would be some sort of environmental
variable I could set in the .pinerc or in the Pine setup/
config that I could modify to address this issue.

Thank you all for any assistance in advance.

Kathleen

I added /usr/local/nuglops/bin/pine and went from 3.91 to 3.95.
I changed the inbx-path=~/.mailbox/inbox.

However, after logging out and back into Pine, I am back at version 3.91.
What else do I need to change to make 3.95 stable.

It would be graet if you could issue a step by step guidelines. As it is,
the information you put out is often incomplete. Remember, some of us are
new to all this....

	Hello.
	I just installed both binary and source distribution of Pine 3.95
on my Linux machine running 1.2.8 and connected to the internet with
ethernet. Neither one of them give me news reader option. Is pine for linux
not supporting news? I look at the misc. docs and FAQ's but couldn't find
an answer. Thanks for your time.

: You want the "Return-Reciept-To:" line in the header of your out-going

Well, this does it, but it adds these headers to _every_ message I send. I
definitely do not want every message confirmed when read/delivered.

*Hint to the authors*

It would be an excellent feature if one could toggle this when composing a
message! (Pegasus Mail under DOS/Windows does it...)

	Hummm....information incomplete, huh?  You forgot to tell us what
platform you are using for running pine.  But, that's OK...we figured it
out from your headers.  Also, who is "you"?  I'm sure you are talking
about the kind folks at netcom, right?  But, read on....

	Anyway, from what you have written it sounds as if you have two
copies of pine on your system.  On is 3.91 and the other is 3.95.  Your
problem is that when you login an environment variable get set called
"PATH".  This will tell your shell what directories to look into to find
executables.  It is searched in consecutive order.  So, your system will
execute the first instance of pine that it finds.  You have several
choices.  You could rearrange your PATH variable so that the directory
/usr/local/nuglops/bin comes first...or nearly first...or you could name
pine something like mypine.  The chances of finding "mypine" in your path
sounds a bit unlikely.

	Your email is not "pine".  Pine is a User Agent (UA) which helps
you to read/compose/etc. your email using a varity of protocols.  For
accessing your mailbox it either uses the "direct" method or a protocol
known as IMAP.  (It may also be forced to use POP3....but that's a 
different matter.  :-) )  Netscape has a built in email UA which uses POP3
as the protocol to access your mailbox.  So, it *may* be possible for you
to use Netscape to access your mailbox from a different location.
However, much of that depends on the network layer allowing this and if
your service provider supports POP3.  Chances are they support POP3.
However, the network level may not allow connections from a "different"
place.  It all depends on what you mean by different place.

	I'd suggest you check with your service provider as they should be
best equiped to answer this question.  Certainly they know more about your
situation than the 10's of thousands of pine users all over the world.

	Regards,

		Ed

The general idea is that Pine by default starts your new message _above_
the included text.  This is because the "new" text of your reply is
(hopefully!) more important than the "old" text of the original message
(which the sender already knows about/others have already read).

By putting your reply above the included text Pine helps the recipient
find and read it easily, without having to first wade through lots of old
text.

I'm a little confused about what you're actually trying to achieve...

Most people encountering this behaviour for the first time ask about
getting their new message text put below the included stuff.  However you
seem to imply that you're happy with having your new message above, but
dislike having to "manually insert lines so [you] can type in [your]
reply".

If you really mean this then you shouldn't be having a problem: as you
type and fill up a line Pine will automatically start a new one whenever
it is needed.

However if you really _are_ asking about how to put your new text beneath
the included stuff then go to Pine's Setup Configuration screen and check
out the "signature-at-bottom" setting.

Cheers,

RE: PC Pine Version 3.95 Beta July 15, 1996, running under WINDOWS 3.1,
on an Intel 486DX33 with 8MB Ram.

I have almost completed the installation process, but am not sure if I
am on the right track: 

I am converting from Eudora Light and my Eudora settings are:
        POP Account: jcham@mail.yesic.com       
        SMTP: mail.yesic.com
        Return Address: jcham@yesic.com

I have used the following Settings in PINE:
        Userid: jcham   
        Host/Domain: mail.yesic.com
        SMTP Server: mail.yesic.com
        INBOX: {mail.yesic.com}INBOX 
                        
I get the following ERROR message when I open up PINE (I am connected to
the Internet when I do this - my Internet Provider has provided me with
Trumpet Winsock  2.0 Revision B):
        "Can't connect to mail.yesic.com,143 Refused 10061"
(I should also mention that I am not asked for my Mail Password (and I
don't believe I have set a mail password in Pine yet) when this error
occurs. When I use Eudora, I AM prompted for my Mail password before I
can do any any mail functions.)

I took another shot at it & changed my INBOX setting
to:                 	{mail.yesic.com/pop3}INBOX
as I understand it will use POP instead of IMAP if you specify this.
The result is this error message: "invalid remote specification".

Any idea where I might have gone wrong?

Thank you.

James

Dear Mike:

I went into Setup and Config and found the signature-at-bottom
feature and unset it.  Worked like a charm.  Thank you for
your assistance.  It's wonderful!

Kathleen

I am using PINE 3.95 on a university system (unix-based) for mail and
newsgroup reading. I am satisfied with its performance for both functions
but would love to have a kill file for some of the trash in the 
newsgroups I read.

Is there a way to create a kill file for PINE and how? 

I sure appreciate any help.

    No.  At present, Pine does not support killfiles.  I have heard
a rumor that some day, in the great somewhen, a future release of Pine
may support killfiles, but we'll just have to wait.

    In the meantime, if you are on a Un*x system that has trn
installed, there is a way you can sort of kludge together a killfille
mechanism.  It ain't pretty, but it sort of works.  Email me for
details.

There's some windows software called MFERRET.EXE (can't remember anything

It's actually there, just not as simple of a toggle.  Make sure that in
setup/config you have the "Return-Receipt-To" header *without* a
pre-filled return address.  

Then, when you are composing a new message and want a return-receipt,
use <ctrl>-R to bring up the rich headers.  Simply fill in the mail
address you want the receipt sent to in the Return-Receipt-To field.

Alas, PC-Pine does not yet support POP.  Perhaps you can persuade
yesic.com to run an imapd as well as a pop3d?

	I have some troubles to open properly my "folder collection". 
I can't open the expanded list without opening the "news collection" one 
at first. Otherwise, the only folder I can access is the INBOX one.  The
problem is annoying when it's time to work in the folders. That particular
problem occured after doing changes by accident in the setup.
	I hope I am clear enough.

	Thanks for your help,

	Jean Theberge

Hi All,

	I received a mail with part of the body as

	APPLICATION/octet-stream; name="good.tar.gz"

How do I retrieve the the body part of the mail to be good.tar.gz so that
I can uncompress, view the tar contents.

Do I need additional tools to do that.

Thanks in Advance,
Ramesh

Well, we got imap4(beta) and pine 3.95 working the other day.  However, 
we noticed an odd bit of behavior as we were testing it and are 
wondering if what we were trying to do is beyond what pine/imap are 
supposed to be able to do.  Here's the scenario:

If we start pine on one machine, everything is fine.  Then, with this 
instance of pine running, we start pine on another machine as the same 
user.  After a short period of time, the first instance of pine 
relinquishes the folder lock to the second instance running on the other 
machine.  However, if the second instance on the other machine is shut 
down, the first instance never gets the folder lock back, so it can no 
longer process mail unless it, too, is shut down and restarted.  In 
fact, regardless of whether the second instance is shut down or not, the 
first instance apparently can not recover the folder lock.

Our question is, should pine/imap be able to "pass the folder lock" back 
and forth as we thought, or are we pushing it too far?  And, if it 
should be able to do this, what do we need to change/set in order for it 
to work?

Pine for Linux does support news.  Check your pine setup and make sure that
you have 'nntp-server' set to whatever machine that the newsgroups are
stored on.  If they are stored on your ISP's machine, then this will be
something like news.yourisp.com (ask them to make sure).

If you use INN or something similar to get the news and put it into
/usr/spool/news on your machine, then you can set this to your machine's
name.

If you want to edit your ~/.pinerc directly, this is the option:

# NNTP server for posting news. Also sets news-collections for news reading.
nntp-server=

I hate when this happens.  I'm pretty sure this question hit
the list recently, but if it did the answer didn't stick in
my brain...
I checked Pine/Setup/Config and .pinerc, and don't see where
I can turn *off* the 'reply-to-all-recipients' feature in
Pine Reply.  We've got client who thinks it's an annoyance
rather than a feature and wants to know how to turn it
off...
Ed?  You seem to be the help-page guru - any idea where I
could look?

Much appreciated...

The brief answer to your question is "No".

You misunderstand the purpose of the lock.  It isn't just a "permission to
write this folder" lock.  It is also a "I know where all the messages are
located in the folder, I know the sizes of all messages, and nobody else
may change things" lock.  Once this lock is lost, it can not be regained. 
The only way is to reparse the entire folder, which is done by closing the
folder in Pine (quitting in the case of INBOX) and opening it again.

This is because of the way that UNIX mbox format works.  The act of
changing flags (not to mention assigning UIDs) changes the size of a
message.

In certain other formats, e.g. tenex, it is possible to change flags
in place without changing the sizes of messages.  These formats permit
multiple simultaneous read/write access, and only forbid expunge when
someone else has it open too.

Which field are you trying to change the name of?  I have set the following
in pine.conf:

# user-domain specifies the domain part of your return address on outgoing
# email and is also used as the default domain for email composed to a
# local user.  If unset, Unix Pine will obtain the domain from the system.
user-domain=gmi.edu

This makes all outgoing mail for users on my site put "username@gmi.edu".  I
have been trying for years to get all users to quit using the explicit name
of the main mail host and to tell people their addresses are user@gmi.edu
and pine's config here is a big help.

If the sysadmin wants to freeze this, create a pine.conf.fixed I believe.

 >cd into pine3.95/pine/osdep/ then edit os-XXX.h where XXX is your os type
 >(ie. I use Linux, so it would be os-lnx.h) and enable ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM.

Both of the previous 2 posters were simply wishing to change the domain part
of their address to match an MX record for the domain rather than a host.  I
am not sure the advice given by Jason addresses the issue.  Both of them
have the right name, but the wrong domain.

	That is not a configurable option at the current level of
pine.  

	Question, what does you client want?

a.	Never to be asked, but include *all* in replies?

b.	Never to be asked, but *not* include *all* in replies?

	Just curious....

When the message is displayed, press 'V' to view the attachment index.
One of the items in the index will be ' APPLICATION/octet-stream;
name="good.tar.gz" '. Press 'S' to save it to a file, and give the file
a name like <whatever>.tar.gz. You can then process the file to gunzip,
untar, etc...

Cheers.

Hi,

	Here's an interesting one that happens once in a while.....
The senario goes like this.....

1.	I'm reading messages in a folder.

2.	I hit tab move to next folder but no mail so I'm prompted about
	INBOX.

3.	I respond "yes".

4.	While moving to the INBOX new mail arrives.

5.	I see this:

+   203 Oct 22 Liwei Feng          (2,381) Re[2]: Mail*Hub HScc gateway for Chin
    204 Oct 22 Philipp Schaumann   (2,138) Re: White Pages features with GDS500 
+ N 205 Oct 22 Daisuke Mitarai     (5,405) If you have spare time around AOEMA m

6.	The "beep" hasn't come and pine hasn't informed me of new mail.
	However, my pointer is at 204 and I hit tab to go to 205.

7.	Pine doesn't move to or detect new mail at 205 but cycles through
	my inbound folder list.  When it returns I see this:

+   203 Oct 22 Liwei Feng          (2,381) Re[2]: Mail*Hub HScc gateway for Chin
    204 Oct 22 Philipp Schaumann   (2,138) Re: White Pages features with GDS500 
  N 205 Oct 22 Philipp Schaumann   (2,138) Re: White Pages features with GDS500

	and my pointer is at 205.

8.	When I hit v.  See the text from the "real" 205.

	I'm running pine3.95 on Solaris.  It was compiled with the
SparcWorks compiler.

9.	I must move from the INBOX to another folder and back to "fix" the
	display.

	Ed

Our newsgroup server has changed its name.  I have tried changing it in 
.pinerc, pine.conf or pine.conf.fixed, it still doesnot work.  I get the 
error message " Can't connect to----,143:Connection refused.  But if I 
type in "export TERM=NNRP.SERVER.COM, and use tin, it works fine.  Also, 
if in just type in tin without exporting term, it automatically connects 
to the old name NNTP.SERVER.COM.  Which makes me believe, that this name 
was set at the compile time.  Should I recompile pine with the new name, 
and if so, how can I do that, Please write in detail.  BTW, we are 
running 3.90 on AIX 3.2.5

Thanks,

How do I print the Pine manual if the print function isn't working from
within Procomm Plus?  (Normally, to print a msg, I'm required to save the
msg to a file, download the file, run the file through an editor & then
print.) 

Merci beaucoup!

A word of caution... be very careful as to how the other user is set up in
Netscape.  I tried to check my mail from a friend's system not knowing
that he had configured Netscape to download all msgs to his system, so all
of my mail was deleted from the server.  We ended up forwarding more than
50 msgs one by one to my mail address.

Go into Setup/Config and select customized-hdrs.  Hit 'A' for add, then
type in the following:

From: jra@aguillon.com

Since you have your own domain, this should work for you perfectly.
Normally, most system admins don't allow this field to change, which the
reason should be pretty obvious.  If Pine tells you this:

                   [Not allowed to change header "From"]

Then you'll have to change a setting in pine.conf, but I can't remember
which one it is.  I'm sure the documentation will tell you.  Good luck!

Go into Setup/Config, and read the online help for download-command and
download-command-prefix.  That should tell you everything on how to set
up message downloading.  Good luck!

Go to Setup/Config and select customized-hdrs.  Type 'A', then type in the
following:

From: kolak@uiuc.edu

That will change your From: field.  Of course, your system admin may not
allow this.  A good test is to set that field anyway, and if Pine gives
you this error:

                     [Not allowed to change header "From"]

you're pretty much out of luck except to use .forward, though I'm
uncertain if this is what you want to do ultimately if the From: field
fails.  Good luck!

Hi!

As you can see I have some problems with my Pine 3.95 setup. It always
sends the name of the newsgroup I'm posting to as the "from" header. How
can I put in my name & email instead?

No flames please even if this is propably a silly question...

Thanks,
	Hanno

Is it possible to have several adressbooks in PINE?

Allow me to elaborate:
I happen to know many people in both Greenland and Denmark. Some are
students and some are not. As my adressbook has grown, it it has become
less well-arranged. I would like to be able to load e.g. four different
adressbooks.

How do you guys/girls out there manage huge adressbooks?

	You need to define "better".  What I would consider "better" is
not likely to be "better" for you.

    Try pressing Ctrl-Q.  I cannot guarantee that that will unfreeze
your screen, but it's worth a try.  Some systems use the Ctrl-S/Ctrl-Q
pair to stop/start communications.  Not all do but some do, and that is
why Pine itself does not use either of these key-combinations for its
own use.  Consequently, it sounds as if your problem may actually be
outside of Pine.

Hello!

You probably have already noticed that my real name is missing when I'm
posting to newsgroups. Pine puts to:<newsgroup> in place of my real name.
BTW: I did set my real name in the configs altough this should not be
necessary since I'm working on unix (that is AIX 4.1.4).

Does anyone know how to fix this problem?

Thanks in advance for any replies!

Ah, just another one:
How do I tell pine insert a Reply-To Header with my name and email
address when posting? I added Reply-To to the customized-headers and
Reply-To shows up with Rich-Headers as it is supposed to but it is quite
annoying to insert my name and email address by hand every time.

As above, thanks for any replies.

Please mail me a copy if you're going to reply to the newsgroup. 
I'm not subscribed to comp.mail.pine. More thanks.

Hi Pine users,
  I'm on UNIX and in my $HOME directory I have the file
"~/.addressbook.lu", which contains just a lot of numbers.
  Does anyone know what these numbers are for? Can I safely delete this
file?
  Thanks for any help.

J.Y.E.

	Well...not quite true.  Everyone in the entire world sees 

	From: Haidinger Walter <e9225662@stud1.tuwien.ac.at>

	Please go to the i(ndex) screen and type ?(help).  Do a bit of
"Information Research" and find the following section:

  SENDER: The name or email address of the sender.  If you are the sender,
then the first recipient's name is shown here.  In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed.

> Does anyone know how to fix this problem?

	It is not a "problem"...but you can change the behaviour of pine.

	Go to m(ain), s(etup), c(onfigure).  Find "index-format", type
?(help).  Do more "Information Research" and pay special attention to this
section...

The token FROM is like FROMORTO, except that it always shows the From
address, even if it is you.  TO always shows the first address from the
TO line, or the first newsgroup if there is no To.  SENDER can be used
to show the Sender of the message, as opposed to what is in the From line.
 
> Thanks in advance for any replies!

	Oh...I was hoping for a special thank you for typing so much...
:-)  However, I think I will save this response since this question gets
asked/answered over and over and over again.  I've done such a nice job of
cutting and pasting the help items it seem a waste to not save it....

	You can delete it....but pine will just recreate it.

	It is a "hash" of the .addressbook file.  Pine uses it to speed
things up.

	Its not such a huge file that deleting it will free up so much
space.  So, just leave it be.

The ".addressbook.lu" file is the "quick lookup file" associated with your
address book.

Assuming you are going to continue using Pine and its addressbook leave
this lookup file in place (otherwise Pine will just recreate it next time
it is run, slowing you down a little).

Cheers,

There is no problem -- only your own Index screen shows this, not messages
you send out.

This is because Pine is attempting to be very helpful and squeeze the
maximum amount of information into a small space.  The presence of "To:"
in an Index screen entry *implies* that the message was sent out by you.
Given that you now know this the rest of the space is used to remind you
who/which group the message was sent *to*.

This is invaluable when you keep sequences of messages (including your own
replies) in folders.

Go back to the Setup Configuration screen and put the cursor back on the
customized-headers variable.  Typing a "?" will disply the built-in help
(see this command in the menu at the bottom of the screen?).

Amongst the rest of the help for this variable is this sentence:

	Each header you specify here must include the header tag
	(Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.) and may optionally include a value
	for that header.

This implies that you simply need to change the custom header you added
from:

	Reply-to:

to:

	Reply-to: Your Name <e-mail@address.site.wherever>

The custom header will then have its value set to this value by default
for every message you send.

Perhaps you should consider subscribing?  Your first question is asked
(and ansered) several times a week :-}  In return you may then be able to
help others with similar problems.

1.	Fix your script to be "MIME aware".

2.	Don't try to use pine for non MIME messages.

	If I remember correctly, the RFCs urge implementors of MIME 
compliant UA to include this indication.

Hello,

Our current Internet/PC-PINE confign:

We have an Internet setup with some Personal E-mail Boxes as well as Group
E-mail boxes . 
We have installed PC-PINE 3.94 here, accessing Internet E-Mail  thru a
Solaris Unix box running IMAP .

For Group E-mail boxes , the foll is the confign :

1. HOME=F:\IMAIL           ( Default FCC is in Novell F: drive ) 

For PC-Pine clients, the incoming folder collections include all the
group Inboxes . 

F:\IMAIL dir contains the the folder called "OUTBOX.MTX" contains copy of
all outgoing messages . 

PROBLEM:

1.The folder OUTBOX.MTX on F:\imail seem to be getting corrupted very
often . That means, it can be seen/opened as a TXT file under WIndows but
cannot be recognised as folder by PC-PINE . 
The OUTBOX.MTX is made shareable and delete inhibit . But still , the
individual messages can be deleted . 

2.The Incoming folders need to be made read-only so that nobody (except root)  
can delete messages . 

Tried to search Pine-Information but could not get any solutions. 
Help in any form would be appreciated . 

Thanks & Regds,
Harish

# This file sets the configuration options used by Pine and PC-Pine.  If you
# are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide configuration
# file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments in
# this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about

# notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.
# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated
# by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a
# continuation of the previous line.  For a variable to be unset its value
# must be blank.  To set a variable to the empty string its value should

If ^S freezes the screen, a ^Q should unfreeze it.  I don't know why you say
you are losing things.  There is a pine setting
"preserve-start-stop-characters" that may need to be changed if you want to
disable this.  I do not mess with that, so I am not sure what turning it off
and on does.  It also has to do with how every computer, modem, or other
communications device in your connection is set.

I had to quit and start Pine again. It was the only possibility to

So far it *might* be a pine question.

All of a sudden it is *not* a pine question.

At the risk of starting a war, netscape is worse as a mail reader than pine
is as a newsreader.

 >Do you have any advice for me?

My advice would be to keep using pine as your mail reader.  It is possible
to run netscape and a telnet window with pine in it at the same time.  That
is what I do from my home PC, a SPARC running Solaris 2.5.

If you really want to run netscape as your mail agent you will have to
configure it.  If they are passing out netscape, they may or may not have a
suggested configuration for netscape.  Right now it is trying to use the
default value of looking for a machine named pop.

If you are using IMAP (which I never have), I thought you could have
multiple inboxes, either on different machines, or, I thought, on the same
machine with different usernames.  You probably will have to authenticate
for each different account.

	Well, I use a User Agent called (oddly enough) "pine".

	You mean UAs other than pine?

	However, if you use another UA which is not MIME aware,
other than doing the "right thing" by switching to a MIME aware
UA there are other tools.  One is called mupack....but I don't
have the location information (sorry).  Others may know...or there
is always Archie and/or AltaVista.

Our environment is AIX 4.1.3 with PINE 3.95.

Some of our users are reporting garbled screens after they enter the
"c" command for compose.

It seems the "c" shows up in the upper left-hand side of the screen and
the rest of the screen is garbled and they cannot enter their message.

It takes a "^C" to get out of it.

Thanks in advance for your help.

If I may also ask a question, We are running 3.90 version on AIX 3.2.5.  
Everything has been working good so far, till until Internet provider 
changed the newsserver name from "nntp.crl.com" to "nnrp.crl.com".  Now 
even after changing the name in .pinerc, I get the error  message, Can't 
connect to nnrp.crl.com,146: connection refused. I have checked putting 
this name one by one in pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed, but no result.  
Also, on typing tin, it automatically seems to connect to the old name 
:nntp.crl.com.  BUT, when I specify "export NNTPSERVER=nnrp.crl.com", 
then it connects fine for tin.  I believe, this was configured during 
compile time.  I will appreciate for some ideas, and if you think it does 
need to be recomplied, how exactly do I do that, because I have never 
installed pine myself before.

Thanks a lot for an early response,

This isn't specifically a Pine problem, but I thought somehow here might
know a workaround.  When people cut and paste text from Microsoft word
into their email program, it's often filled with ^R characters.  The
weirdest thing about them is that if you forward the message to yourself,
they disappear from the composing screen -- but once the message arrives,
there they are again.  Does anyone know how the senders can avoid sending
them, or how us receivers can remove them?  They aren't impossible to read
around, just a bit annoying.

Any and all help appreciated,

Michael

This implies that Unix pine and PC-Pine will be generous wrt
CR/LF and LF in address books.  Is that true.

Also would it be possible to use the same global addressbook across
systems (where they have to share the same .lu file).

Please keep us informed.

David,

Thanks for the information about alternate folder formats as a possible
solution to a folder lock problem with pine.  We'll definitely look into
them.

Also, my apologies to all for posting my original question 3 (!) times.
This was my first posting to the usenet using Netscape's news
reader/editor/poster and it obviously did something I didn't expect. <g>

<SNIP>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you could re-open your INBOX (as of
3.95) by going back to the folder list and selecting it again.  It works for
me...

He asked if he could change the from field.  The error message he saw was
because pine was compiled in the default way, which is set to NOT allow
changing that particular field.  So, in order to change the from field, he
needs to recompile pine by editing that particular file, and changing that
setting.  

True, custom headers may have been set in pine.conf.fixed as blank, but I
highly doubt it, as he is the sysadmin of that system.

If he had asked how to change all but the username for _everyone_ on his
system, I would've instructed him to modify /etc/sendmail.cf  ...or to set
the domain name in pine.conf.fixed  Neither solution would help him if he
were to try to send mail from his root account (or any other), because the
From: header would show root@thefakedom.ain

I've seen once or twice my pine icon in win 3.11 remain red even when I've 
looked at all the new messages. In 3.94 it always went green again

I've not yet tracked down all the symptoms, so if anyone can suggest
any changes it would be appreciated

Get a "active" or a "newsgroups" file and grep for "unix", "bsd",

Subject: opening folder in current directory?
Message-Id: <1996Oct22.095312.17141@paramount.nikhefk.nikhef.nl>
Date: Tue, 22 Oct 1996 09:53:12 GMT

I asked this before, but unfortunately got no response. I would like
to know how to open a mailfolder in the current directory, ie. something
along the lines of 'pine -f mail_from_somebody'. I tried changing
the setup to include an extra folder directory like this: 
 
        folder-collections       = mail/[]   
                                   ./[]  
 
I then tried to access the folder with the -c flag:
 
        pine -c 2 -f myfolder
 
But this doesn't work. Pine interprets ./[] as my home directory.

Anybody?

I am currently running vms pine 3.91.  Whenever I bring up the folder list, the

this?  Thanks.

	From the m(ain) menu, type a(ddressbook), ?(help).  Do some
"Information Research" and find the section on "Distribution Lists".

	Since your email address contains .edu you may consider reading
the help screen as an "education".  I suggest you go "wild" and type
?(help) or when necessary ^G.  You may even learn some niffty features
along the way. :-O  :-)

	While viewing the message type v(iew) and then select appropriate
"attachment".  If there is only the body then there is only one possible
selection.  You will then see the message only without headers.  At that
point type y(print).

The above text is only included in messages that include attachments,
in which case you no longer have "simple ASCII email."

Do you have control over the script, or would the script maintainer be
willing to accept suggestions?  If so, reply with a copy and maybe
someone can give you some hints to fix it...

Ed's suggestion (included below) is the best way for sending mail to a
group of people you correspond with regularly.

However if you were just asking how to send a message to more then one
person (and aren't likely to be needing the same distribution list of
people regularly in the future) then the answer is much simpler:

In the "To:" field put in a list of e-mail addresses with commas in
between them.

To echo Ed's suggestion about "Information Research", the above is
described by putting your cursor on the "To:" field of the message you are
sending and typing ^G (Get Help - it's in the Command Menu at the bottom
of the screen) to see the information about the "To:" field and e-mail
addresses.

Cheers,

    My service provider is running SunOS 4.1.4 and Pine 3.94.  The
technical staff have deliberately and publicly refused to upgrade Pine
to 3.95 on the grounds that it is buggier and worse than 3.94.  A
supervisor has repeated this on an in-house newsgroup.  Unfortunately,
they have not said what they consider the unacceptable bugs in 3.95 to
be.

Hi,

I have a question regarding a command in PINE.  The command is Ctrl-S. 
I would sometimes accidentally press it, and then my screen would
freeze.  I would lose my entire message.  I get frustrated when that
happens because a 3-page message turns out to be a redo message.  If
anyone has any idea of how I can reverse the Ctrl-S command, I would
very much appreciate your response.  Thank you.  :^)

Hope to here from you soon.  :=)

Always,

Linh

    I am not familiar with AIX, but assuming it works more or less like
most Unices, probably the simplest thing to do would be to put .forward
files in the home directories of two of the accounts to forward all
mail to the third.  Just how such forwarded mails will appear to Pine I
cannot say, as I have never had reason (or opportunity) to try this. 
As such, Pine itself cannot wander all over the system reading mail here
and there.

I suddenly cannot print an e-mail message from my pine shell account

I was able to print OK, then in the past. I have not made any changes
that should change my print configuration.
Does anyone have any idea where I might look to trace the problem.

How can I really use my old MH folders?\

All the MH folders are in ~user/Mail.


The example is:
    o A folder name beginning with "#mh/" is an mh format folder.
Examples:  #mh/mail/sep-1994, {rembrandt.art.nowhere.edu}#mh/mail/sep-1994


I tried to add a new folder :
 #mh/Mail    or
 #mh/Mail/mail

but the result was "can't create mailbox #mh/Mail/mail: mailbox already
exist.

Another way I tried to define folder collection Mail/mail/[] and it
interpreted messages which are in the particular files as folders.

Any ideas?

No.  That's what the 1000 bit (the sticky bit) prevents.

Well, you can't really get a definite answer.  Your question is asking
for an opinion, not a fact.  In any event, I do find Pine to be the best
program to use for e-mail and Usenet.  I can read my e-mail, read
newsgroup postings, see all my folders listed at once, and shell out to
the operating system when necessary - all done with the same program.
Pine is quite convenient for me, and it does a good job with Usenet
newsgroups (specifying OrderSubj sorting works great IMO).  Before I knew
about Pine, I used Elm for e-mail and tin for Usenet.  Yeah, this is
finicky, but I like it when I can do both e-mail and Usenet with the same
program.

Just opinions.....

i receive my mail on a pop server, and i configured pine to what i
understood to be enabled new mail notification (an asterisc in upper left
corner?). however, it does not seem to work, i never see new messages in
my folders. to get them, i end up having to quit and restart pine. i know
that pine periodically connects to the server because when the server goes
off line or there's a network glitch pine complains about not being able
to connect (i forget the exact message wording).

is there something that needs to be enabled or disabled to get this
behaviour? or should i complain to the server admins? this are the
cuurent feature setting in mine .pinerc:

	The "secret"?  "Information Research".  :-)

	Remember, it doesn't acutally replace anything.  If you were
to examine the contents of the "outbox" or whatever the source is
you will actually see:  From: yourname@foo.bar.com or whatever.  It
is just how pine is configured to "display" this information.

	In the default configuration pine with compare the "From:"
field in the message with the "From:" field it would have generated.
If they match, then the To: field is displayed.  Pine will also
compare the contents of the list "alt-addresses" in your .pinerc
file.

	Hummmm....doing "Information Research" on that "alt-addresses"
field may be of value.  Think I'll check it out after I say....

	Regards,

		Ed

Hi!

Just a simple question: Why does pine 3.95 keep a MIME attach from a
mail in the reply I send?

Concrete example:
I got a mail written with exmh, which uses the MIME multipart
feature.  Both parts were text/plain and the first part keeps the
message, the second one the signature.  So long so good.
But when I reply to this message the second part isn't quoted or
simply ignored, but it is attached to my reply.

IMHO this does not make much sense but the risk to overlook this
unwanted Attachment is big...

Is there any choice to disable this "feature"?

Ciao

        Roland

Hey!  Thanks a bunch for your reply on comp.mail.pine.  I've had the same
problem myself, but now you've given me some reading to do so that I can
cure this minor dilemma.  Thanks again.

	Using pine3.95, huh?

	Did you perform *any* type of "Information Research"?  Did you
go to m(ain), s(etup), c(onfig)??  Did you look around?  Did you
find:

         FEATURE: include-attachments-in-reply
 
This feature controls an aspect of Pine's Reply command. If set, any MIME
attachments that were part of the original message will automatically be
included in the Reply.

	Looks like I found it for you....  :-) :-)

Subject: Re: PINE 3.95/Compose


If I may also ask a question, We are running 3.90 version on AIX 3.2.5.  
Everything has been working good so far, till until Internet provider 
changed the newsserver name from "nntp.crl.com" to "nnrp.crl.com".  Now 
even after changing the name in .pinerc, I get the error  message, Can't 
connect to nnrp.crl.com,146: connection refused. I have checked putting 
this name one by one in pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed, but no result.  
Also, on typing tin, it automatically seems to connect to the old name 
:nntp.crl.com.  BUT, when I specify "export NNTPSERVER=nnrp.crl.com", 
then it connects fine for tin.  I believe, this was configured during 
compile time.  I will appreciate for some ideas, and if you think it does 
need to be recomplied, how exactly do I do that, because I have never 
installed pine myself before.

Thanks a lot for an early response,

You didn't say *where* you had made the name change.  I suspect it wasn't
to the "nntp-server=" variable.

Go to Pine's setup (then select config) and unset
preserve-start-stop-characters, that should get rid of the problem.  After
that you should get a message at the bottom of the screen saying something
to the effect of "XOFF command received, see setup ...".  For more
information about it, do some of Ed's information research ;-) and hit ?
when you move down to preserve-start-stop-characters.

If you do have nttp-server set to:

  nnrp.crl.com

make sure that news-collections is set to:

  *{nnrp.crl.com/nntp}[]

Don't quote me on this, but I'm thinking that if Pine is trying to connect
to nnrp.crl.com,146 that means at port 146.  On my system that isn't
anything (according to my /etc/services), but nntp is at port 119.

This is actually a different cut and paste question. I'd like to send my
resume via Pine e-mail in ASCII. I have the resume on disc, use MS
Works/Windows 3.1, and need to transfer the resume from my disc to Pine
compose message. How do I do this??? Please explain in really simple-to
understand language and assume little basic knowledge on my part. Thanks.

I think ctrl-q will un"freeze" the screen for you.

Hi,

I'd like to change the following behaviour in PINE:
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE

I'd like to have this 8-BIT. Is there a configuration option to change this?

Thanks for any hints...

To Mike (I think):  We tried to duplicate the cut-and-paste
from MS-Word to Pine problem here (in a networked
environment, both machines with Win95, Pine 3.93) and it
didn't happen...
???  Is there maybe something specific in your environment
that is causing the CTRL-R characters to appear?

Subject: PC-Pine: trouble defining folder-collections

I've found that adding remote folder collections to the folder-collections
entry in the configure menu causes pine to ignore my local collection.

I have folder-collections defined to

$HOME/mail/[]
{my.remote.host}~/mail/[]

but only the second, remote collection is available from the folder list
menu.  The local collection is available when it is the only entry in
folder-collections.

On-line documentation says the first entry in the list is the
default for saves, which is what I want.  But changing the order doesn't
help anyway.  ANy ideas?

thanks,
Michael Smart

PC-Pine appears to be very unforgiving if you tell it to use a directory
that doesn't exist. Is your $HOME variable set incorrectly? Does that
subdirectory /mail/ exist? A way around a problem here is to give the full
pathname. Also, the remote collection definition can be simplified. Here
is my collection from my PINERC file, which works fine. Perhaps it will
give you some ideas. 

folder-collections=Local-Mail C:\PINE\MAIL\[],
	Remote-Mail {acs-mail.bu.edu}Mail/[],
	Archived Mail B:\[]

PS: If you are setting these by editing PINERC, the commas appear to be
important.

Simple workaround: forward it to yourself, and cut the offending list of
names.  Then print.

Are you running Yehavi Bourvine's port of PINE, from HUJI?

There can be a problem with identifying the RFC822 headers in 
the mail.  If the mail starts with an RFC822 header that isn't
in his list, his prog's inclined to act as if there weren't any 
RFC822 headers and try to get the date from the VMS MAIL headers.

I think if you review my notes at

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html

you'll find something relevant.   Hope that helps, but if you
are dealing with some other port of PINE to VMS, then it probably
won't  ;-)

    This is what *you* see.  We see your real name normally.  Pine does
this on purpose on the assumption that in your own folders, you already
know what your own name is, so Pine instead reminds you whom you sent the
message to.  Pine is working the way it is supposed to.  We see your
name correctly.  You are the only one who sees to:<newsgroup>.

    There is no problem to fix.  Pine is not broken.  This is the way
it works.

    When you add the Reply-To: header in customized-headers, you can
also insert the value you want there in the configuration file so that
it will already be present when you start to compose a message.  You do
not have to fill it in every time.

Don't you get something like what is at the begining of this
message when you reply.

First, do you really want the reply to precede the original.  I
find it convenient to put my replying comments after the relevant
bits of text.  It saves people have to scroll down to see what
the original message was.  I hate answers that say "yes" while leaving
the whole of long quoted email message for me to read to
see what the question was.

Also, you shouldn't really need to inset line.  If you go to
the begining of the message body and start typing things should work.

I hope that this helps.

Nice to meet you.
I have a question about the plan of PINE.
Do you have any plan to develop Intranet based PINE mail having
following architecture ?
  - HTML based User Interface or Java
  - Web server : Solaris 2.x
  - Web based mailing service using in individual organization compling
    SMTP, MIME protocol
If you have any information about that please send mail to me.
Thank you.

  Try "comp.unix.*", for example, "comp.unix.questions".

Nice to meet you.
I have a question about the plan of PINE.
Do you have any plan to develop Intranet based PINE mail having
following architecture ?
  - HTML based User Interface or Java
  - Web server : Solaris 2.x
  - Web based mailing service using in individual organization compling
    SMTP, MIME protocol
If you have any information about that please send mail to me.
Thank you.

Conversely, I hate having to scroll down through reams of text I already
know (having seen before, or even sent out) just to reach "Yes".

For a lot of my replies I use the "reply before included text" format.
That said I do use the "intersperse reply text within in included text"
when appropriate, and with judicious editing of the included text.

In my view having a default of "included text before reply" is too easy to
"misuse" and just tack one's reply onto the end without any editing down
of the original message text.

Cheers,

Well, we got imap4(beta) and pine 3.95 working the other day.  However, 
we noticed an odd bit of behavior as we were testing it and are 
wondering if what we were trying to do is beyond what pine/imap are 
supposed to be able to do.  Here's the scenario:

If we start pine on one machine, everything is fine.  Then, with this 
instance of pine running, we start pine on another machine as the same 
user.  After a short period of time, the first instance of pine 
relinquishes the folder lock to the second instance running on the other 
machine.  However, if the second instance on the other machine is shut 
down, the first instance never gets the folder lock back, so it can no 
longer process mail unless it, too, is shut down and restarted.  In 
fact, regardless of whether the second instance is shut down or not, the 
first instance apparently can not recover the folder lock.

Our question is, should pine/imap be able to "pass the folder lock" back 
and forth as we thought, or are we pushing it too far?  And, if it 
should be able to do this, what do we need to change/set in order for it 
to work?

There is no mechanism in the IMAP protocol to pass locks between
sessions.  The specific behavior you are seeing is an artifact of the
old Unix (bezerk) mailbox format.  It is not possible to get a lock
back without reopening a folder, but Pine doesn't usually close and
reopen the INBOX, which causes the problems you see. 

This problem caqn be averted by using one of the more robust folder
formats supported by Pine and imapd.  If you are using Pine to access
folders as local files, your best bet is probably Tenex format.  If
access is strictly via IMAP, you might also investigate the newer MBX
or MX folder formats.  For details on Tenex, see

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/low-level.html#format

To set up mail delivery directly to an alternate format, see the tmail
program, available in

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

Hi All,

	How do you convert a mime formatted mail that u received
	back to the original format like ascii or binary.

	Are there any tools to do this and where do I get them.

Thanks in advance.

The SCO crypt supplement (lng225b) will provide you with the international
crypt-only function you need, but the library in which this function is
placed is called "crypt_i" instead of "crypt". Needless to say, this is
not the place where a regular program such as Pine would look for it.

To fix the problem, you can execute:

   ln /usr/lib/libcrypt_i.a /usr/lib/libcrypt.a 

That ought to do the trick!  Works for me :-)

Of course that is worse than "yes" followed by entirity of original
text.  Basically, if people don't edit or interpolate, then reply before
text is better.  But it is best to get people to edit.  reply before
text encourges people not to.

Furthermore, replies to replies to replies are more readable if they
all include the text before the reply than if the all do it after.
(And if they mix, it is a nightmare).

there is that danger, but "reply before include test" makes it much easier
for people to not edit the include text at all.  I suppose that only
experience will tell.

I forgot how this whole thing began.  I can see a case for having
include text after reply as an option, although I don't
think I would make use of it.

  If I see a lot of message of the type you
describe, I will reset pine.conf here.  So far, I haven't seen too
many unedited include texts before replies.

Hello,

we use pine version 3.93
It has very annoying feature:

when you send mail outside our domain
it always adds our own domain address
to receiver's field.
For example when you want to send message to
msiiskon@hornet.pspt.fi and type msiiskon@
to To-field it makes the address like
msiiskon@khro.fi and i have to edit the
address backwards to correct it.

Can somebody please help me.
I haven't found anything concerning this
from Config Setup

Mika

	The pine group doesn't do "chat".

	Your questions are a bit too general.  

	You need to describe your environment for people to supply you
will valuable advice.

	But, basically, there is no difference where you install pine.
Just put the executable in your home directory and set the permissions
accordingly.

	Regards,

	Question:  How do your expect pine to guess that user msiiskon
is at hornet.pspt.fi?  Why not at mit.edu or sgi.com?  Just typing
msiiskon@ or msiiskon is considered an underqualified address.  It is
quite standard proceedure to append the local domain to that type
of address.

	Or, maybe I'm not understanding your question...

	Regards,

		Ed

No Ed you didn't but it may be because of my bad english ;-))

What i am trying to say is that i don't have any chance to
write the rest of the address (for example hornet.pspt.fi)
because when i have typed msiiskon@ pine makes the rest of
the address automatically (that is msiiskon@khro.fi).

After that it jumps to Cc-field and writes @-mark there and
the cursor blinks in Cc-field too.

Now if i want to correct this i have to delete @-mark from
Cc-field, then go to To-field and edit the rest of the address
by deleting khro.fi and retyping hornet.pspt.fi

	I *fully* understand now!

	OK, this appears not to be a pine problem.  You should
*not* be getting the @ sign in any of the fields without your
typing it yourself.  I suspect there is something amiss with
your "stty" settings or your TERM settings.

	Can you tell us more about your environment?  Like the
platform you are running on, etc?

	I'm not an expert in stty settings and the like...but
you may want to type "stty -a" at your shell prompt and post
it to the group.  Someone may see something.  I've had a problem
in the past where typing a @ character acted as a "kill".

	Anyway, I don't believe pine is to blame...otherwise
not many people would be using it.  :-)

	Ed

Hi and think you for the use of Pine.  Your constant up-grading is
appreciated as are you welcomed suggestions.

I had noticed that with previos versions of Pine, that when call waiting
would interupt an e-mail session, that Pine would save the message and
there would be the ability to continue the message at a later time.  WIth
this new version (3.95), that does not seem to be the case.  At times,
I have composed a rather long letter and due to call waiting and being
bummed off line, found my self having to re type the entire thing, often
forgetting what I had written.  Is it possible to replace this feature???


Thanks

I'm not sure if this is a Pine or a sendmail problem, so I'm posting it to
both groups in the hope that someone can help. 

I have Pine 3.95 and I have sendmail 8.7.6 both running on a Solaris 2.5.1
system. I compiled the sendmail myself using gcc and I generated the
sendmail.cf from the .mc files. 

In my global pine.conf file I have
'sendmail-path=/usr/local/bin/sendit.sh'. The sendit.sh script calls
sendmail with the options '-oi -oem -t'. 

Our connection to the Internet only operates during working hours, so
overnight I run sendmail in 'delay' mode (sendmail -bd -odd) so that all
mail is queued. However, it still appears to be trying to deliver mail
when it is sent using Pine. Is this something to do with the way that Pine
is using sendmail?

All suggestions welcome! Thanks in advance,

 Tim Porter

I have noticed some bugs in the new pine. 
When I am reading my mail the top paragraph or two are cut off unless i
maxamize my window. 
It carries parts of pages over, when you go to a new screen, so you are
seeing your current doc, and part of your old one.
Sometimes it doesn't list all the commands at the bottom of the screen. 
When you scroll down it messes up you doc for when you scroll back up. 


I do however, like the speed of the new pine, It sends mail, creates
folder lists, and logs off much faster.

I'm using Pine on a Mac in a university network.

Control C is ineffective. To make it effective, I have to first pull down
Sessions from the menu bar, click on Set-up keys and then in "Interupt
Process" chance the default ^C shown, to ^Z. Every time I open Pine.

Is there a way ^Z can be set as default?

PS the pc's on the network do not have this problem.

	Sounds like you are using a MAC.  

	I'm not a MACer....but the problem is most likely with your
telnet SW.  Are you using the NCSA telnet by any chance?  I've heard
there are ways to "fix" your problem....but not being a MACer.

	Does this fit the description of your problem?

	First, pine will save it your your "home directory".  What that is
will vary depending the platform you are using.  You are running on an
RS6000 machine.  So, that would indicate you are accessing pine via
a shell account.  With "luck" you are not accessing pine through a menu
driven shell account.

	Anyway, the attachment should be saved in your home directory.
Now, the trick is "what is" the attachment.  It shows up as "octet-stream"
which is a "catch-all" type.  It would have been nice if the sender could
have told you what the attachment is or sent it in such a way that the
MIME headers told you.  

	If the attachment is an MS-Word or whatever....then you'll need
to xfer it your PC to view it.

	Other wise....you can try, your your shell account, typing 
something like "more filename"

	Hope this helps....

Hi,

	Does someone know how to configure and force Pine to use
ISO-8859-1 character set to display incoming mails, even though it's
indicated within the mails US-ASCII is being used as character set? and
how to force Pine to "think" the encoding is QUOTED-PRINTABLE?

		Thanks

Lin

Pine is stictly MIME and ESMTP RFC compliant. First, you have to enable
esmtp 8bit negotiation in pine setup.
However, your sendmail (of a sender) and sedmails of all recipients must be 
able to handle 8bit ESMTP mail, otherwise it will be converted to 
QUOTED-PRINTABLE.

To check this, telnet to your mail host, port 25 and type:

EHLO my-host

If you got a response containing:
 
250-8BITMIME

then your sendmail accepts 8 bit mail. If not, you may need to recompile it.
However, with MIME compliant mail utility, like pine, you should get 
QUOTED-PRINTABLE encoding converted back top eight bit, so you shouldn't 
worry.

	Well, it sometimes depends on the platform.  Running U*IX, VMS?
Anyway I'll just assume you are on a U*IX system.....and I'll assume
you have a shell account....

	Create a file in your home directory.  Make sure it is world
readable.  The file must be named .forward.  The contents of the file
should be:

newaccount@host.someplace.edu  (you get the picture?)

	On some systems you can type "man forward" or "man sendmail"
and it will give you additional info....

I added Return-Receipt-To: and Reply-To: to my default composer headers
but they woin't show. To the opposite, now only default default headers
show up, not even (while composing to a newsgroup) the To: line which is
in my default-composer-headers list. Is this list by some means limited?

I have a related gripe, which makes me all the more want to turn off reply-
to-all-recipients permanently, till it is fixed.

Pine 3.95 seems to have a logical error during reply if I say yes to reply
to all recipients, I get (for example) the following error in the composer
screen.

Cc      : HUTCH@CMOD2.PFC.MIT.EDUhutch,
          UNEXPECTED_DATA_AFTER_ADDRESS@.SYNTAX-ERROR.,
          hutch@VENUS.PFC.MIT.EDUHUTCH

The header of the message I am replying to is

Date: Thu, 24 Oct 1996 14:30:43 +0100

The different addresses arise because of forwarding of my mail from
remote machines.
 This happens with all messages, but there is no error if I say no to
reply to all recipients.

Does anyone know how to fix this problem?

Well, the subject is true but I couldn't actually use a subject
pertaining to my question as I would get needlessly flamed. So, on to
the question, shall we?

Yep, you guessed it. FILTERING. I want to know how to filter a
message. Wait, hold on, I've read the FAQ, and I know what procmail is
(and use it daily on my unix machines)! So how could I possibly have a
question about filtering?

I use Windows NT 4.0. I run PC Pine for Windows 3.95. The IMAP server
is also on a WIndows NT 4 system. There is no ELM, nor an ELM filter
program, for NT. Thre is no procmail for NT either.

What kind person out there can tell me how to filter my incoming
messages?

Much oblidged!

-Christian

    Ummm, just a refinement, Ed.  I believe that should be "current
directory."  Probably for the great many Un*x Pine users, their home
directory _is_ their current directory, but it doesn't have to be. 
For example, I have a directory $HOME/tmp, and I always make that my
current directory (usually via my login) before I start Pine.  All
exports, attachment saves, and what-not always go into that directory,
not my home directory.  I do this deliberately to avoid the risk of
cluttering up my home directory.

	I can't....

	But your subject should have been "Filtering email on an 
NT machine"!!

	Ahhh...well a further refinement...it will be "current directory" 
iff you have " use-current-dir " set in your configuration.  Otherwise
it will be your "home directory".  I suspect you have " use-current-dir"
check but just forgot about it.  :-) :-)

    I stand refined on my refinement to you :-) .  It has been so long
since I did anything with that part of my configuration that I had
forgotten about it.  However, even the help screen for that option
could use a little refinement.

    For inclusion and attachment of files (I have not tried the latter
lately) one may merely specify the filename and get the file from the
current directory (or home, as the case may be).  But what the help
screen does not tell you is that you can give an explicit path and
fetch a file from anyplace on the system that you have read permission
for, not just the current (or home) directory.  (I am speaking of Un*x
Pine here.)  I have used that undocumented feature many, many times.

I use Windows NT 4.0. I run PC Pine for Windows 3.95. The IMAP server
is also on a Windows NT 4 system. There is no ELM, nor an ELM filter
program, for NT. There is no procmail for NT either.

What kind person out there can tell me how to filter my incoming
messages?

Much oblidged!

As he mentions, *if* you are using the Vi editor. If you aren't, you

    Actually, Pine mostly just takes the raw characters and passes them
unchanged to the display, which may, of course, be on the other end of
a communications link.  It is up to the display device actually to
convert the bit patterns of the input into properly displayed
characters.

    For example, I use a DOS desktop computer dialed in to a Un*x
server.  It is my computer's current code page which actually
determines what I see, not Pine.  I can, and occasionally do, change
code pages on one and the same message and see different things.

    Notice that I said "Pine mostly...".  If the headers say that the
message is in Quoted-Printable format and Pine finds =xx in the
message, it will convert it to the corresponding 8-bit pattern and then
pass that through.  Again, what you actually see for such a character
depends on your display device, as Pine is no longer in the picture at
that point.

    I'm not sure what you mean by forcing Pine to "think" the encoding
is Quoted-Printable.  Do you mean that there are Quoted-Printable forms
in the message but no header to tell Pine so (as can happen if the
headers get mashed), so that you are seeing =xx instead of a character?

    1)  If this is so, 2) if you are using Pine on a Un*x system, and 3)
if Perl 5 is installed on the system, then you can do the following:

a)  Put the following one-line Perl 5 program in a directory in your
    $PATH:

perl5 -pe 's/\=([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})/chr(hex($1))/ge; s/\=\n//;'

b)  Make it executable and do a rehash;

c)  In your Pine configuration, make sure the pipe command is enabled;

d)  When you see =xx Quoted-Printable forms that you want the "real"
    characters for, invoke the pipe command (|) and use the name of
    the Perl 5 program above; it will convert the Quoted-Printable
    forms into the "real" characters, which will be up to your display
    to show correctly;

e)  Be sure to exit from the Piped Message screen before you try to do
    anything else with the message.

The above looks ok, but you need to ask your service provider if they are
running the IMAP daemon service.  Your error msg looks like they are not.
Without them running IMAPd you will not be able to use PC-Pine.  Also you
should double check the host addresses for SMTP, etc with your provider.

>I took another shot at it & changed my INBOX setting
>to:                 	{mail.yesic.com/pop3}INBOX

PC-Pine does not support the POP3 option.  Only Unix Pine does.  PC-Pine
may support it in a future version but not yet and not soon.  If your
service provider does not support IMAPd then it probably supports only
POP3 and you will have to get/use another mailer pgm.

Is it possible to configure Pine to request acknowledgement that a

Go to Setup/Config and make sure you have enable-aggregate-command-set
checked (or X'ed in this case) in feature-list.  Then go back to your mail
folder and list the index of the messages on your screen.  Then tap ; A A
D in that order.  Of course, this will mark all your messages 'delete'.
If there are specific ones you'd like to keep, you'll need to Undelete
those individually.  Hope this helps!

Hello,

We're in the process of implementing an IMAP based email solution for
our institution, but in order to address the needs of machines incapable
of running windows/mac clients, we're trying to get PC-Pine 3.95 to
work.

The problem seems to be that no matter how far we strip down the system
and what drivers are loaded and so on that PC-Pine 3.95 will only do the
most basic of functions and then seize up with memory problems.  I'm not
the person doing the PC testing, but the person who is says that she had
to reduce the machine to almost no functionality to be able to compose
just a simple message, folders and collections were almost out of the
question.

Is this typical?  It seems that it wants about 500k or more to do what
it needs to do.  For now we're sticking with pine 3.91, but it seems odd
that such a glaring error made it to 3.95...

Ideas?

Scott

Chances are pine can read the existing folders as they are.  You
don't give enough information, but here we have pine reading
mbox's and MH folders happily as well as incoming mail on IMAP and
POP3 servers.  Pine is THE tool for reading mail on multiple systems
and in multiple formats.

You don't give enough information about your old system for me
to give details, but with luck your sysadms will have figured
out what needs to be done.  They should set up a default pine.conf
which allows you to read folders created by your previous set up.

Subject: Any more info on problems with pine 3.95 and Solaris 2.x?
Date: 27 Oct 1996 15:59:11 GMT
Message-Id: <5500sf$h25@news.eecs.umich.edu>

In addition to being the webmaster of GMI, I am responsible for the
installation of almost all the free software on our Sun systems, including
netscape, pine, elm, nn and tin among hundreds of others.

It seems like once a week someone posts with a problem using pine 3.95 with
Solaris 2.x, where x usually equals 5.  The only constructive suggestions I
have seen are the patch that was posted here, with some caveats, on Sept.
4.  There have been enough statements about 2.x where x<5 that I have been
nervous about upgrading from Pine 3.91, about which I get zero complaints
from hundreds of daily users, to 3.95 which has some additional
functionality that I would like to have (only one user has explicitly
requested that I upgrade).  Up to now it has not been much of an issue
because most of our public use SPARCs run Sol 2.4, but we are staging to
upgrade our 4/690 server running Sol 2.4, where most of the users run pine,
and when the UltraSPARC server comes in we will install the latest version
of Solaris (probably 2.5.1 Web) on it and on all the public use
SPARCstations except for a few SS10's that have the EOL framebuffers in them.

I really need more information than has been forthcoming about the problem.
I really hate to stay down rev on pine, but at least the few zombies I get
are not unkillable as has been reported with 3.95 on Sol 2.5.  Mark Crispin
I believe has said something about it being a bug in the Solaris 2.5 streams
code, but aside from the very unofficial patch of 9/4/96, and some
discussion about changed includes and system calls in 2.5, there have been no
constructive discussions.

Since some questions have not been answered in the newsgroup, I almost get
the impression they are being handled offline and out of sight.  What is the
state of understanding and workarounds or patches?

Could you please advise how one can access the phone directory listed by

I know that my parents phone number is listed and don't know how to access
it.

I once saw this with someone's terminal software/setting here: the @ key
first moves forward one word and then @ appears, as if you had pressed
^-space @. That gives exactly the symptoms you are seeing.  Try pressing
@ in the body of your message (inside some text.)

Hi there,

I have a problem with sending email in pine. For some reason, some email
addresses take a very long time (sometimes 1 or 2 minutes) to send a
message to. I press ^X, en it says "sending email", and I have to wait for
1 minute before I can proceed. The messages are not long, that doesn't
matter.

Does anybody know how I can let pine do this in the background?? So that I
can read/send other email?

Regards,
Koen.

     The header says it all...  Right now, if your sysadmin hasn't set
up rimapd correctly, you are screwed.  I have to type my login and 
password in every few seconds!  I don't mind doing once per session,
but the way things are set up now is a real pain.  If you are reading
this and are a pine developer, please do something!  =)  Thank you!

    Interesting question.  However, it does not seem to have anything
that I can tell to do with Pine, which is what this newsgroup is all
about, so please do not be disappointed if you don't get an answer. 
(You might or you might not.  This is not a general anything-about-
the-Internet resource newsgroup.)

    I take it that you want a copy of your message stored in a
particular folder.  If you check the online help, you will find that
there are two ways to do this.  For any one message, when you use the
Compose function, there is an Fcc: field in the headers specifying
where that particular message is to be stored.  You may specify 
anything you want.  If you send to the same address over and over, you
may specify in your addressbook where you want the copy to be stored. 
Check the online help screens.  There is a wealth of useful information
there (ALL NECOMERS TO THE GROUP, PLEASE NOTE).

    If there is such a way, I am not aware of it.  Perhaps someone else
will know.  One thing you could do would be to export the message to an
external file and edit that to remove the names.  However, you would
then have to have a way of printing that file outside of Pine.

    (By the way, it is considered better practice on the Usenet to give
your post a more informative Subject: line than just "Question.")

    If Pine tells you that there is an attachment to your email --
which is what I suppose you are referring to by "mime formatted mail"
-- it will usually tell you whether the file can be viewed or not.  If
not, you will have the option of saving the attachment in a file.  Pine
should take care of the conversion for you automatically.  (This
assumes the attachment was sent in base64 encoding the way Pine itself
does it.)  If your situation is different, you may need to provide more
details.

Scott,
You haven't said which version of PC-Pine you are testing.
There are huge differences in memory management among the DOS, Win16, and
Win32 versions.

The DOS version of PC-Pine is the most problematic.  Between 3.91 and 3.95
lots of stuff was added, with a corresponding increase in code size.  It
needs about 15K more than 3.91, at least 500K.  We hope to improve on
that in the future, but it ain't easy...

I am a user of unix pine. Every time I try to reply to all when my
address appears under the cc: portion, I end up replying to myself as
well.

Is there any way to change this so that I will only reply to everyone
else without having to delete off my own address each time?

Also, whenever I decide to break up a paragraph in to two by pressing the
return key, I find
myself having to realign the remaining parts of the
paragraph or it will turn out some thing like this. Is there a way so that
I do not have to manually realign the rest of the mail line by line?

(By the way, in this case, the return key was pressed after the word
"find" and before the word "myself")

Many Thanks!

To make additional header available you must add them to the
"customized-hdrs" variable in Pine's Setup Configuration screen.

You can then see/alter these when composing a message by putting your
cursor on any header line and typing ^R (Rich Headers).

If you want some headers to appear *by default* in the Composer (instead
of typing ^R to get to them) then _also_ add them to the
"default-composer-hdrs" variable.

Note that if you set a value for the "default-composer-hdrs" variable it
*replaces* the default set of headers with (just) the ones you specify.
To include the "standard" headers then you need to include them also in
the "default-composer-hdrs" variable's value.

You may like to check the built-in help for both of these variables in the
Setup Configuration screen whilst you're there.

Cheers,

Your "reply to self" problems are stemming from Pine not recognising your
e-mail address in received messages (probably in their "To:" line) as
being your own.  Because of this it thinks it belongs to someone else, and
hence includes it in a "reply to all".

You need to persuade Pine that this other e-mail address really is you
too...

Make an exact note of the your address as it is appears in a message you
receive.  Now go to Pine's Setup Configuration screen (S then C at the
Main Menu) and look down the settings for "alt-addresses".  Put your
cursor on this variable and type ? to read the built-in help about it.
When you have done that you should understand what it's for and how to use
it to add the e-mail address you noted down as an alternative for "you".

As for word-wrapping... Pine's composer will happily start new lines
whenever the current line is full as you type.  However it will not
automatically re-word-wrap text if you split paragraphs as you describe.
(Remember that it is a simple text editor, not a word processor.)

However all is not lost: the ^J (Justify) command will re-word-wrap the
current paragraph and even out all the line lengths for you.

(Note that a paragraph is bounded by blank lines, or ones that are
indented.)

Cheers,

[Tut, tut, Ed ... you're slipping :-)
He actually said in his message he was using a Mac, and also that he knew
hot to fix it for the current session. :-]

John -

The problem you describe is nothing to do with Pine per se, but is to do
with your communictaions program's settings.

Your description of a fix suggests you are using NCSA Telnet (it would
have helped if you had said explicitly!).

If so then you have two possible solutions, one more general than the
other but relies on you being able to change NCSA Telnet's permanent
settings preferences file (or persuading your System Administrator to do
it).

General Method:
--------------
Select Edit menu -> Preferences -> Sessions
Select and change the session you use (possibly "<Default>").
Alter the keys defined there to meet your wishes.
	(eg, I actually set Interrupt Process to be empty as it will then
	get passed to the host for handling, rather than Telnet remapping
	it to an interrupt command within the Telnet protocol)
Save the settings.
Start a new session to your host and try things out.

(The settings in the "Sessions" preferences dialog form the default values
which you can subsequently modify for a connected session using Setup menu
-> Setup Keys...)

These changed settings get stored in NCSA Telnet's own preferences file in
your System Folder.  If you can't change this, or it gets reset
periodically (eg when the Mac is restarted) then you can't use this method
yourself (but may be able to persuade the Systems Manager to make the
necessary changes).

Host-Specific Method:
--------------------
Alternatively, try connecting to the host you use and configuring the
session's keys appropriately (using Session menu -> Setup Keys...).
Now use File menu -> Save set... to save these as a "settings document".
Quit Telnet.
Now launch Telnet *not* by double-clicking the application, but instead
double-clicking the settings document you saved.

This should connect you straight to your host ready for you to login with
your username and password.

It *may* have also saved the changes to the keys as well (check by
looking in the Session menu -> Setup Keys... dislog box).  [I haven't
tried this myself so can't say for certain, but it _may_ work ... it
depends on what gets saved in your settings document.]

If this works, keep the settings document somewhere convenient and always
use that to connect to your host, rather than just docule-clicking the
Telnet application.


Cheers

Yes.  Add a line to your signature file saying something like:

Hello,

It is possible to get unix Pine to trace how it sends the mails..

e.g. the route they were sent?

Just curious...

If you can help give me a mail!

Thanks

Do a control-J (^j) while the cursor is in a paragraph will "fill"
that paragraph, and the cursor will move to the beginning of the
next paragraph.  It is very handy (this works Pico also).

First, I remember that PC-Pine does not do POP3 yet.  You can use other
applications for POP3.  Some are freeware.  Pine is good for IMAP.

Second, Pine does not do incoming mail sorting (some people call it
filtering), at the time being.  I am not sure if it ever will.

	OK....I'll stop trying to answer questions from hotel rooms in
Japan where the dialup charges cause a "rush to judgement".  See you

I've got TZ set to EST5EDT on both Unix:

 setenv TZ EST5EDT

and DOS:

 set TZ=EST5EDT

But on both systems my messages are being sent out as EDT.
How do I specify that it's now EST?

Thanks,

    Sorry, but you have not given us anywhere near enough information
to work from.  There are many, many variables, and they all add up to
different solutions depending on what your configuration is.  My first
recommendation is to ask a Help Desk or User Information Center, if one
is available to you.  If one is not, you will need to provide us with
fairly complete inforation on your configuration before we can help
you.  (Too much information is better than too little.)

I don't think it's possible in 16-bit PC-Pine but I would love it
if it were!

Hello

Preliminary info only.  I obtained three solutions to Ctrl C ineffective
on Mac, Pine on Telnet NTSC. Two are temporary solutions. One may be
permanent but not yet checked out. I'll post all  solutions after checked
out. Thanks a lot.

Is this a discusssion group?  I'd appreciate subscribing details please.
Again, thanks a lot.

It's great to see the Pine FAQ posted to the *.answers groups so
it will be archived on all the FAQ servers.  I have a few comments.

* How about including `FAQ' in the subject - that way people will
  be able to easily tell that it's the FAQ.  A possibility is:

	The recent update of pine system in my university had made it
unable for me to read or write email on my computer. All emails are
converted into machine fonts - including the pine manual. I cannot get
assistance from my university computer center because students are not on
the priority list but I need excess to email urgently. Please advice. My
computer terminal is a power Macintosh 6200.
	Thank You.

Sincerely

Pek Lan, Foong

Hello,
     Please tell me, I'm using Pine 3.93 and created a distribuuution list
in address book. Now when i send an e-mail to distribution list it add all
the addresses to To: field. What i want is to shortened the to field and
send the e-mail to all useeers also. I want to short the to fieeld because
it is a very large list and 3 to 4 pages are wasted with to field.

    Go into your addressbook screen and read the online help about
distribution lists.  This will allow you to send a single email to as
many people as you want with a single entry on the  To:  line when you
compose a message.  You only need to set up a distribution list once in
order to use it over and over.  However, when you compose your message,
you may include multiple recipients just by typing in all the addresses
separated by commas.

I need to install Pine as a mail client on a "sealed" system.  By
"sealed", I mean that there will be no user accounts and access to
Pine will be via a captive login account.  Access to a user's mail will
be made with IMAP on a Cyrus IMAP server.

I would appreciate any suggestions as to how to best accomplish this.
Reading through the pine-info archives, there has been mention of this,
but never a description of how to accomplish it.  I know that I can't
be the first person to do this, so any assistance would be appreciated.

Please note the heavy cross-posting that I have done.  You may want
to edit where you reply to to avoid unnecessary clutter.  Please reply
directly to me since I do NOT actually subscribe to all of these lists.
If anyone feels a summary is appropriate, I would be more than happy to
summarize the responses I receive.

Thanks,

Bill Larson (wllarso@sandia.gov)

Date: 28 Oct 1996 21:51:05 -0500
Message-Id: <553rep$99k@panix3.panix.com>


  Is there any way to send Rich Text Format files as a MIME attachment
that is NOT in type TEXT/PLAIN? I'm trying to send an RTF file to an AOL user. 
What happens is that the TEXT/PLAIN attachment simply gets viewed in-line, and
the other person can't download it as a separate RTF file.

  What I'd like to do is force my e-mailer to attach it as "type
APPLICATION/octet-stream". I assume this would make things more
straight forward on the AOL end--the person could simply download
the attachment as a regular file.

  I am using pine, and I can't figure out how to change the default
"format guessing" that gets used with MIME attachments. I also have
the option to use elm or Eudora for Win, though I ran into the same
problems with both.

  With the net being so convenient in many ways, it's weird to find that
a simple file transfer can be a major headache. Please e-mail or reply
in the NG if you have some pointers. Thanks.

	I am trying to print messages from PC-Pine 3.95 (Win 3.11) to an
IBM "Lexmark 4039" LaserPrinter.  I have set the
Print-Formfeed-Between-Messages option from the configuration screen, but
when I print more than one message they come out on the same page.  There
is a small "." type character in between the messages so it looks as
though the printer doesn't understand what pine is outputting as a
formfeed.

	Any ideas ?

	Please reply by email to S.Oldfield@nla.gov.au.

Thanks in advance

I've been putting off this question, hoping to resolve the problem on my
own, but I haven't had any luck.  Whenever I attempt to print a message
using ^Y (attached-to-ansi set in config file), everything cooks along
just fine, my software (Procomm Plus/Windows) indicates that it's
operating in "dedicated print mode", but just when the job is about to
print, I get an HP msg indicating a printer port problem.  When I look at
Print Manager, I see that the printer (HP DeskJet 540) is in "pause" mode
& to resume the print job only sends up the same port problem message
again.

Some info that might be helpful:

I'm using Pine 3.94 (didn't have this problem with the previous version),
my comm port is COM2 & my printer is LPT1.

Any suggestions would be most appreciated.  I've already tried disabling
Print Manager but ended up with the same problem.

Many, many thanks!

OK guys

Just want to thank you bothed and Mike.

As I said in an earlier mail, I've got some solutuinbs and I'll post to
the list and to Pine.


I worked in Japan and travelled there from Australia frequently over a
periof of about 15 years.  Have you tried the Imperial hotel, Ed?  Not one
of the newest, but certainly one of the top. Big rooms, reasonable rates
and very  comfortable. In Japanese: Teikoku hotel. ot convenient to
subway, but near Ginsa so you can waddle back to the hoteel after a night
of eating and drinking (-:

Hi, how do I view attachments that my friends have sent me through
their emails...I have a lot of pictures and images that I can't view
becuase my viewer always says - can't view, save to be view later, but 
I'm a user of Odin and by just looking at the program for odin, I don't
see how you would be able to view anything anyway, it's seems to me to 
be only for emails....

help.....

Yes, this is a discussion group.  You can read/participate in it in either
of two ways:

*  By joining a mailing list (Pine-Info), or
*  By reading a Usenet News group (comp.mail.pine)

The two are equivalent because a bi-directional gateway sends copies of
messages sent to one across to the other.

If you don't mind being bombarded by messages the Pine-Info mailing list
may well provide the most rapid response, whereas the vagaries of Usenet
News may mean that articles take a while to reach you.  However Usenet
News has the advantage that if you are busy or away for a while your
mailbox doesn't grow huge! :-)

If you wish to join the Pine-Info mailing list you can find out more ab
out it at the Pine Information Centre on the Web:

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/

In particular, how to join is explained at:

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/subscribing.html

An archive of past messages (which is searchable) is also available there.
This is a useful place to start a search for information if you have a
prticular problem or question.

The comp.mail.pine newsgroup should be available on most sites' Usenet
News servers.  If it is then you can use your favourite newsreading
program (Pine?) to join in.

Cheers,

--

The best way of using distribution lists is to:

...start composing your message
...put your cursor on a header line and then type ^R to see the Rich
   Headers
...put the distribution list's nickname onto the "Lcc:" field
...enter a Subject and the Message Text before sending the message.

Note that you don't need to put anything into the "To:" field; filling in
the "Lcc:: field will put the descriptive name of the distribution list in
there automatically in a special way.

However I can't recall whether the "Lcc:" field was rpesent in the (old)
version 3.93 of Pine.  (The current version is 3.95; you may like to
upgrade as it has many new features and some bug-fixes.)

If "Lcc:" isn't present in your version of Pine put the distribution list
nickname into the "Cc:" field instead.  However in this case you will need
to put in a value for the "To:" field by hand.  Set this to a short
description followed by ":;" (eg, "List of recipients:;")

It sounds like you haven't got Pine configured to use NNTP, but are using
the default IMAP protocol.

The simplest way to set up a news server with an NNTP type connection is:

*  Set the "nntp-server" variable to the IP address of your news server.

*  DON'T set the "news-collections" variable to anything (or set it to an
   empty string if your System Administrator has set a systemwide default
   for it).  [A news collection is _implicitly_ defined by setting the
   nntp-server variable but leaving the news-collections one unset.]

If you do want/have to set a news-collections value make sure you incluide
the /nntp switch to tell Pine to use NNTP rather than IMAP.

Check the built-in help or documentation which accompanies Pine for more
details.

Cheers,

When I try opening a newsgroup using pine, it gives the message:

"No permission to talk. Goodbye."

and doesnot open the newsgroup.

What change do I need to make in the .pinerc file. Please give the
required information and oblige.

I miss your fantastic show.
I was thinking of asking you for some advise.
I don't want to go deeply into it yet,but 
because your a Greek Cypriot like myself I 
think that you might be able to relate to my 
current tricky situation and give me some 
advise.
I would appreciate ti so much if you could 
reply to me so I know your thre before I tell 
you my problem.
If your not interested because you get these 
sort of emails all the time, then please at 
least write me a short message telling me to 
piss off..........but I'd rather you reply.  I 
can't phone you now, and this is the only way 
I can contact you...please help Ceaser!!
From a real fan, fellow Greek Cypriot and 
fellow Spurs supporter.

Basically you need to use another news server.
Or ask the administrator of the news server you are currently using to
give your machine access to it.

At the moment the news server software is configured to not allow your
machine to read or post articles.  The error message you quote is actually
not from Pine itself, but from the News Server software (and Pine is
merely reporting to you the error message it received).

cheers,

I have set up the auto-save-read-messages to a single folder
without problems. Does anybody know if I can set the
read-messages default folder to a variable ie. the same as my
saved messages which is "by-from"?(sorts received mail by who
it is from). I have tried this directly and it asks to create
folder "by-from".

Is this possible? I am using (Unix) Pine 3.93.

Many thanks for any help in advance.

Did you read my previous reply?  I said that many mainframe and PC packages
offer this privacy invading feature, but that it is not part of the Internet
standard.

Dear friend,

I am having trouble exporting from pine.  I am working on a MAC Centris
650 computer.  I select a file I would like to export by moving the
cursor to highlight it, type the "E" command, and fill in the name of the
file into which to export the e-mail message.  I have done this
several times, and so in subsequent times the program informs me that
the file with the name I designated already exists and it asks whether I
want to overwrite or append to it.  But then when I use the "Retrieve
it" program to search for the string corresponding to the name of the
file that I assigned, whether I have it search among file names only, or
in all file names, data and resources, it finds no such string.

Needless to say, ability to the use the export command would greatly
increase the efficiency of operations in our office.

I hope that I have not misdirected this inquiry.  If I have, please
accept my apology and send a brief reply to that effect.  Otherwise, I
will look forward to receiving any information you may have to help me in
this matter.

We just went onto PINE 3.95 today, and I am missing one lovely feature:
the plus-sign that flagged incoming mail.
Within a given folder, this feature gives a very valuable quick-view of
the volume of mail that has been received versus sent-out (within that
folder.) 
Can someone tell me if there is any way of getting that feature back??
It's sad when "upgrading" includes the loss of a feature a lot of people
may enjoy--while adding lots of features that some of us can't even
apprehend, let alone USE.  (Maybe users should VOTE!!!) 
HOW I MISS THOSE PLUS-SIGNS!!
AM I THE ONLY ONE???

I'm very happy runing Pine under Linux, but I was wondering if there might
be a future version of Pine compiled for XFree86.  True, Pine in an Xterm
works wonderfully, but what about a pretty version of that?  ;-)

I have no need to do this, so I am unsure of the details, but I'm sure you
could figure something out with that by checking your sendmail.cf or on a
user level, maybe you could have procmail or elm's filter look through each
inbound message for a certain tag like return-request-reciept or whatever
it's called.

I remember having this as a built in part of Pegasus Mail for Windows when
I was using it.

Try leaving the smtp-server setting in your Pine setup blank.  This will
tell pine to pass the message off to the system's mail delivery agent
(probably sendmail), and sendmail will take care of it as you continue
reading/writing.

I don't know of a way to get pine to show this information, but if you leave
the smtp-server setting blank, which would tell pine to pass each outgoing
message to the system's mail-delivery-agent (probably sendmail), then you
could view /var/log/messages to find out where the message was delivered to. 
This is assuming that you would have access to that file, and that
/etc/syslog.conf has the following line (or something similar) in it:

*.=info;*.=notice				/usr/adm/messages

Then you might want to try using a util like dig to "dig theaddressyoufound"
to find out the path your system uses (might be different each time
depending on network situations) to get to that address - if it doesn't go
there directly.

Then again, sendmail might be configured to send all mail to a designated
system (your ISP for example), in which case it went there and only there.

BTW, you can also increase the output that sendmail shows to include
DETAILED smtp negotiations, etc. which I'm assuming would also go in
/var/log/messages (/usr/adm/messages, /usr/log/messages, whatever it's
called).

I don't know why your address doesn't have a plus with 3.95, but it did with
whatever previous version you were using, but you're looking for the
alt-addresses setting.

I'm assuming that you're talking about UNIX Pine (because you didn't say
otherwise, and that's what I'm using :) ).

- From the main menu hit S, then C, then move down to alt-addresses.  Add your
e-mail address(es) there.

I have three e-mail addresses, I put them in there and all mails addressed
to me have the +

By "central unit", you must have meant the mainframe computer
where your account is.  If so, you are right.  The files will
stay on the HD on that machine for a while.  How long they 
remain there depends on many factors.  If the disk is mostly
empty, the files can stay for very long time before they are 
overwritten.  However, system backups may not carry them 
since they are marked as deleted in the HD directory.

Hopefully, the system security is good enough so that your
emails are not read by others.

Just my 2c.

Hi!

Looks like a bug in Pine 3.95. Two scenario:

I. I have alt.security.pgp and comp.security.pgp* in my .newsrc. I want to
create *one* collection with these groups. So I go in setup and define
collection:
  PGP *.security.pgp*[]

(Note, that I *must* add [] otherweise Pine loudly complaints).

After restarting Pine I have PGP collection O.K.; if I enter it, I see all
my groups in there. Now I try to eneter news group
comp.security.pgp.announce; after a while Pine tells "[411 No such
group]"!!!

II. Probably, this explains, why group doesn't exist.

I *don't* have above groups in my .newsrc. I define collection as above,
restart Pine, enter collection - Pine tells me, I have to subscribe. Well,
I hit A,^T and am presented with list of above groups in full form - that
is, alt.security.pgp, comp.security.pgp.announce and so on. I go in List
mode, select all groups, subscribe - O.K. I try to enter any group - and
get the same message. And when I look into .newsrc - I have entries like

  *.security.pgp*alt.security.pgp:                                                
  *.security.pgp*comp.security.pgp.announce:                                      
  *.security.pgp*comp.security.pgp.discuss:                                       
  *.security.pgp*comp.security.pgp.resources:                                     
  *.security.pgp*comp.security.pgp.tech:                                          
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi Pine fanatics!

Do you know how to indicate if the newsgroups has no message? Basically I would
like to see the number of post in the index

	<nb_of_post> comp.mail.pine

Best would be that pine index only the newsgroups with messages? Possible or
not? 

Thanks for your time.

I think you aren't using the correct syntax for the collection name.

You don't want:
	*.security.pgp*[]
but:
	[*.security.pgp*]

To be honest I would have expected this to be more of the form:
	PGP *{news.your.site}[*.security.pgp*]
if you are accessing your News over an IMAP connection, or
	PGP *{news.your.site/nntp}[*.security.pgp*]
if you are using NNTP instead.

However I may be wrong on the latter if a host gets use implicitly (or
perhaps you are reading direct from a local news spool area rather than
using IMAP or NNTP?).

Anyway, try the "[*.security.pgp*]" syntax instead of "[]".

Cheers,

Hi !

I've got pine configured so that it uses another host as default save
folder. (due to disk quotas on this host)

This works quite fine except for one thing:

Pine keeps nagging about my username and password on the remote host.

If I press "S" to save a message, then I get asked for username and
password. Then pine opens the remote folder and tells me "folder XYZ
does not exist, create?) I press Y and get asked for username and
password _again_.

It's worky to have to supply both username and password up to two
times to save one message. Is there any way to avoid this ?


Please reply by email and I will summarize and post any replies.


Sincerely,
	Eivind

Thanks! It works.

Now, could anybody explain difference between [comp.os.linux.*] and
comp.os.linux.[] ?

To whom it may concern

The previous version of pine had a facility which allowed inbox messages
to be expunged when quitting pine. This facility seems to have been
removed with the new version. Short of having to delete each single entry,
the inbox therefore quickly gets clogged up with new messages.

How about reinstating the 'Expunge read messages?' facility when quitting
pine?

The only way I've found to do it is to choose Forward.  Then take out the
old headers and the "(fwd)" out of the subject line.  I'm not sure, though,
if the headers include any info regarding the forward.

What computers and OS is Panix running?  Wasn't Panix one of the ISPs that
got hit by the SYN denial of service attack a couple of months ago?

As it is now, you can quite easily export your whole folder, and
thereby get it QP-decoded, with the command series: ;aae (means:
select - all - apply - export). This works in pine 3.95, I don't know
about earlier versions.

I have tried to use the options to fix this, but to no avail. I am trying to find a way for the mail I send 
not to include the address I am writing from, but an alternate address. I don't want, for example, 
replies to personal mail sent to my office when they are written from my office account.  I know that there is 
the reply-to header, but for people who do not pay attention, this does not work. The system administration 
has fixed my domain, so I can't chamge that in the configuration. If you could help me with this, it would be 
greatly apriciated. 

Also, is there a way to set the reply-to header, so I do not have to type in the return address every time I 
send mail?

Thank you very much,

Adam

That syntax is incorrect.  The correct syntax is:
incoming-folders= INBOX {oak.ait.fredonia.edu/pop3}

Note that the brackets are very different.

Additionally, you should strongly consider using pine 3.92 or later
for pop3 mailbox access.  There bugs in the Pine 3.91 pop3 code.

I enable "incoming folders" in pine and use `procmail' as a filter to 
distribute new mail into an appropriate folder.

Stuff that needs regular attention (e.g cron output from daily sysadmin 
tasks, notification of firewall issues, postmaster related stuff) goes into 
its own `incoming folder'; stuff that is of interest when I get around to it 
goes straight to a regular folder (non-incoming) and I check it over morning 
coffee etc.

Thus, a .forward in your other accounts could feed mail to your favourite 
account where procmail could distribute and filter it.

You're in luck today.  You've just run into a guy who does this every day
of his life.  I hope you're on a UNIX machine.

Pine includes the pipe feature which allows you to pipe the current
message to a UNIX program.  Included with majordomo is a program called
"approve" which will automatically approve any message that is piped to it
by puttin approve header in its correct spot.  These two features combined
allow you to approve messages on the fly in Pine by piping them to the
"approve" script supplied with majordomo.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Sincerely,

    I do not remember in which version the Lcc: field came in, so I do
not recall whether you have it in version 3.93.  One thing you can do
is put the name of your distribution list in the Bcc: field.  (Press ^R
if necessary to get Rich Headers.)  Then be sure to put _something_ in
the To: field, such as your own email address.  (Throw away the copy
you receive, if you wish.)  This way, each recipient will only see his
own name on the copy he receives and not the entire long list.

    Check to see if the Lcc: header field is available in your version
of Pine.  If so, please read the online help material about it.  It is
easier to use than the technique I mentioned above.

       I've just patched pine ver 3.95 to work better with terminfo database.
Now keys like PgDn, PgUp, Home, End, Backspace, Delete and Insert should
work in pine, pico and pilot . Patch was tested on Linux and Solaris 2.5.1
system. Available as :

 ftp://ftp.pg.gda.pl/pub/software/services/mail/pine3.95L01at.diff.gz
 
 For those who use Redhat Linux on Intel platform there are also .rpm's done by
my friend T. Kloczek (kloczek@pg.gda.pl) :

 RPM:
 ftp://ftp.pg.gda.pl/pub/OS/Linux/xtras-PG/kloczek/RPMS/pine-3.95-3.i386.rpm

 SRPM:

This message, I am sure, will have the text "To: comp.mail.pine" in the
"From:" field of the index page.  Just what exactly did I do when I
fine-tuned my configuration to cause such an horrendous thing to happen?
Heck, I'm not ashamed, I *want* people to know that it's me posting.
Maybe I should be ashamed, though, 'cos I bet this is a really dumb
mistake on my part, but I have been over and over the configuration
options and I can't find one that seems to help.

Anyone?

As long as you have not exited your Pine session, you can go to the folder
where the deleted message resides and undelete it with the "u" command. 
Once the session has been exited, though, the message will be gone.

[I'm presuming you're new to this newsgroup/mailing-list?  This is a very
frequently asked and answered question.]

Don't worry... there is nothing wrong, and your messages are going out and
appearing exactly right.  The "To:" prefix only affects your own Index
screen.  This is mentioned in Pine's built-in help for the Index screen
(type a "?" at that screen to see it) ...

-----
  SENDER: The name or email address of the sender.  If you are the sender,
then the first recipient's name is shown here.  In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed.
-----

The reason for this behaviour is to try and help you be giving you as much
information as possible: the "To:" *implies* the message from you, and the
remaining space is used to remind you who/where it went to.  This is very
useful at times, especially in folders of saved messages.

Folks, rather than keep on answering this particular question perhaps we
could usefully have some discussion about how best to avoid it being asked
in the dirst place?  (I remember the days when Pine-Info did this sort of
thing, before being gatewayed to comp.mail.pine :-(

How is Pine/its documentation/help falling down here?  Is the description
in the help not sufficiently clear (perhaps including the reason for the
behaviour would be helpful?)?  Are people even finding the built-in help?

Can we come up with any suggestions for the Pine Team over how to help
people in this matter?

Cheers,

Subject: Is this a good idea ?


Good morning,		(UK time 10:00)

	Firstly, may I say what a great EMAIL tool PINE is proving to
be.
	I had written a Mickey-Mouse chunk of UNIX script to enable
our in-house, non-technical users to send/receive EMAIL and, although
it works OK, there is room for (much) improvement.

	PINE is it.

	There are, however, two minor points that I seem unable to
address :-
	1) Many of our users have 100's of messages in their folders.
	   Is it possible to set the 'initial keystroke list' such
that only the last 20 are shown in the index and

	2) After you '^X' to send a message, why does she prompt you
to ask if you want to send it ?  I should like to turn this feature
off, if possible.

Weather here is overcast but mild.

Have a good day.

Cheers,

First of all, this isn't really a PINE question. A little peek into the
"Save file" portion of the HELP file on MS Works will probably help. You
also don't say what platform you're running PINE on. The more information
you give about your problem, the easier it is to find a solution.

Open your file in MS Works, and click "File", then click "Save As". In the
"Save As" file dialog box for MS Works, there should be options for file
format. Choose the "Text Only" option, and save your file, changing the
file name so you don't overwrite your original MS Works file.

How you get your new ASCII file into a PINE compose window depends on what
platform PINE runs on. If you're using PC PINE, Control-R (^R) in the
message test portion of the Compose window will prompt you for a file
name, and you just type the file name, press return, and there it is! 
You'll probably have to reformat the file so it looks good; you can do
this before you import the file to PINE. 

If you're using PINE on a remote system that you telnet or dial into,
first you'll have to upload your file to the remote system using kermit,
or sz or FTP.  (There are other newsgroups that can tell you how to
use these utilities to upload your file.) Then you open PINE,
and insert the file into the compose window as above.

Koen,

I had this problem when I upgraded from 3.91 to 3.95. The problem is that
beginning with Pine 3.92 Pine attempts to send mail to an SMTP server
using SMTP commands, rather than by calling sendmail as a child process.

I solved this by setting the sendmail-path variable in our global
pine.conf file to point to 'sendit.sh', a shell script which sends the
mail using the old method. You can find this script in the contrib/utils
directory of the Pine distribution.

Here is an extract from the release notes which explains this:

 "SENDING STRATEGY
 
 Beginning with 3.92, Pine sends messages in a different way.
 Previously, Pine created a temp file containing the message to be
 sent, and invoked sendmail in a way that would cause it to derive
 the SMTP envelope information from the message headers.  This had
 several disadvantages, including the inability to support ESMTP
 options such as 8BITMIME.  So now Pine, by default, invokes sendmail
 such that it can directly interact via SMTP commands.  However,
 the direct interaction has caused undesirable side effects at some
 sites.  For example:
 
  o If your sendmail is configured to do address validation, it may
    take significantly longer for sendmail to accept the message
    than it used to.  The user sees this delay in Pine.
 
  o Some sendmails are configured to generate X-Authentication-Warning
    (see below for more information on this warning) headers when directly
    invoked by Pine.
 
 If you experience sending difficulties, the first thing to try is
 setting the following configuration variable:  smtp-server=localhost
 
 If that doesn't help, it's possible to revert to Pine's previous method
 of sending via a temporary file.  In the contrib/utils directory of the
 distribution, there is a shell script named \"sendit.sh\"
 
 To revert to the previous sending-method, install this script and set the
 sendmail-path variable to its path".


Hope this helps,

  Tim

Hi,
have anyone compiled Pine on Windows95 Plattform?
I just want know this, therefore I give no detailled information.

I have try it with 'build wnt' and 'build win' without success. I know
that I must copy the c-client directory to the toplevel of the Pine95 dir.

 
On my windows NT machine there are no problems.

TIA
Gerhard

    As a onetime professional VM systems programmer, I can
categorically state that the receipt you can get back with CMS Notes (a
type of VM email system) and PROFS or OfficeVision/VM, if they ever put
it in the latter two, was strictly an IBM artefact that has nothing to
do with email delivered via the Internet.  Pine has NO such capability,
and return receipts, to the best of my knowledge, are not even defined
by Internet standards.  (Although there might be something on this that
I am not aware of.)

    You can, in your Pine configuration, add the customized header

Return-Receipt-To: {your_email_address}

Some receiving email systems will honor it and send you back a receipt,
and some will not.  There is no way you can force them to, so just
because you do not get a receipt back does not mean your mail went
astray.  And it does NOT mean the recipient has actually read your
message.  It only means that it was delivered to the inbox.  It says
nothing about what might have happened to the message after that.

When defining a folder I can do stuff like:

mail/[*txt] 

To get only the folder names ending in txt. I was wondering if pine
recognized any more advanced patternmatching. 

For instance all the people I write most often have defined fcc's that
sare their surname.

Basically I'd like to be able to set up a collection containing _only_
those folders starting with a capital, and another with the rest.

mail/[[A-Z]*] obviously doesn't work.

    Yes.  Please read the online help information about aggregate
commands.  You can forward a collection of emails (from the same
folder) as an aggregate to a single address.

Hi.

I hope you can help me. I'm using a Mac and I want to export email onto my
desktop. I know I can hit "Export file" and put in name of home directory,
but what do I hit to actually send it there before I quit?? Please answer
to Rabi'a Neeno at timneeno address. Thankyou.

Hi all,

I have a user at my site who uses Pine 3.95 running under OS/2 3.0.  He
gets his mail via POP from our Unix mail server.  I've attached the
user's pinerc file below as a text file.

I have two main problems:

1) The user can download messages via POP just fine.  But, he cannot
save them.  When he tries to save a message to a folder, it says that
"Folder C:\MAIL\SAVEMAIL doesn't exist.  Create [Y/N]?".  If he tries Y,
it tells him that it cannot save the message because it cannot create
the folder file.  We've tried not using a folder file (letting pine
create it), and that failed with the same message.  Then we tried
creating the file folder manually, as C:\MAIL\SAVEMAIL.MTX.  This got
exactly the same result.  I'm stumped.  Is this some sort of IMAP
problem (we're not running an IMAP server, but we can if need be).

2) The user cannot send mail.  I'm guessing this is because his OS/2
system doesn't know how to send mail.  I saw in an earlier posting that
PC-Pine can only send mail via IMAP.  Do I need to be using IMAP rather
than POP?

Any help would be appreciated.

#

# Pine configuration file -- customize as needed.

#

# This file sets the configuration options used by Pine and PC-Pine.  If you

# are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide configuration

# file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments in

# this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about

# specific settings see the section on configuration options in the Pine

# notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.

# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated

# by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a

# continuation of the previous line.  For a variable to be unset its value

# must be blank.  To set a variable to the empty string its value should

# be "".  You can override system defaults by setting a variable to the

# empty string.  Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and

# default to "no".

# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Pine.
