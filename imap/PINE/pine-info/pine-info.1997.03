Not as far as I know, but you can set it up to access imap using rsh.
Thats what I did.  You'll have to get the people that administer the
server to make some changes though...

You just need a symlink in /etc/rimapd to the actually imapd binary.  Then
setup your .rhosts for normal rlogin operation.  Pine will automatically
rsh rimapd (no password neceasry if setup properly), if it can.  The only
problem I found with that is it I sometimes get timeouts, and it reverts
to normal imap mode.  There is more on this in the documentation...

Hope this helps,
		Rick

It is working correctly from my POV. When you forward a message to someone,
you place your comments at the top and there is where the sig will be, just
above the forward message and below your comments.

Having the sig at the bottom of the forward message makes it seem that the
sig is part of the forward message and not from you.

Take care,

    Good luck.  I don't think Pine was ever designed to be used in a
batch mode.  I suspect it was deliberately designed to be used only
interactively, for good or for ill.  I have never heard of anyone being
able to do what you want to do.  (If it has been done, I would be
curious as to how, myself.)  Because some people do want to do it, and
it would make Pine even more useful, I think at least limited batch
mode capability would be a Good Thing.

Hello:

You can delete the addressbook.lu (lookup file) in your home directory,
but Pine will rebuild it if it sees it missing.  The file is used as an
index to large addressbooks to speed up searches for nicknames you supply
and matching the address.

The Pine-debug# files are used to troubleshoot your Pine sessions if
necessary.  They store all the information about your sessions.  You can
delete them if you want, but again, Pine will continue to generate them
unless you tell it not to.  Check with the Pine Configuration Utility (in
Main Menu, press "s" then "c" ) to read more about these options.

Hope this helps!!!

I tried this and you would of thought that Lynx was going to go completely
nuts.

This was tried from within Pine, then later after quiting Pine and Lynx
by itself.

CRASH n' BURNned here.

The odd thing is if you just blindly reply to the message/post, Pine will
place the contents into pico. But I was tolds that it just takes whatever
is in the buffer and dumps it into Pico. If it happens to be ASCII all the
better and you can read it.

I still looking for a good way to use the original idea so I can invoke
Lynx the next time I see one of these silly useless HTML posts/E-Mail.

C-Ya,

There is no need for the same message to be posted twice (worse since HTML

You should be able to get the vacation program to do this for you. On our
school system you proceed as follows, (yours may differ slightly - you'll have
to look into this locally):

Start by creating a vacation.msg file containing the message you want to
disply to folks who send you email, and place this in your home directory. At
a command prompt, type vacation -I (that's a capital i, not a small L). This
will create a couple of files in your directory which the vacation program
will use. Last, create a .forward file containing:

\user_id, "| /path/to/vacation user_id"

Then test it to be sure it works. You will find more info than I can give with
man vacation. Also to find out what to put in place of /path/to/vacation, try
where vacation, which will tell you where it finds the executable file named
vacation.

Hope that helps...

Ha! What if we want to remap the pine command keys to make it like elm?

No kidding.  You know, vi has been around for 30 years, and it is way
superior to any existing editor on the market these days.  Ok, well,
maybe not way superior, but it sure beats the hell out of anything else
that I would ever use over a dumb terminal.   10 keys.  I can control the
world with 10 keys.   I can browse the Internet with 10 keys (because
lynx has a vi mapping).   I can edit passwd files, write perl scripts,
construct a lyric poem, ALL WITH 10 KEYS!   So why doesn't Pine have
a vi key mapping for its basic command functions? 

Excerpts from "Secrets of Pine":
* If some control characters don't work in Pine (or Pico), it is
       probably because the communication or operating system software
       you are using is intercepting those characters before they get to
       Pine. Some that are more likely to be intercepted include ^C, ^J,
       ^O, ^^, and ^_ . If you are unable to reconfigure your
communication software to correct this, a work-around is to press
       the ESCAPE key twice followed by the desired control key. For
       example, ^C would be simulated by pressing "ESC ESC C" and "^^"
       would be "ESC ESC ^".

You know what?  With vi, CONTROL CHARACTERS DON'T MATTER!!!! You
can edit an entire file without any control characters, so no 
matter how screwed up your terminal is, it doesn't matter!
I can edit files without even looking at them.  I can compose
and edit files in vi WITH MY EYES CLOSED!
If anyone knows of a way to gain a vi mapping, please send an e-mail.  
Otherwise, I will be downloading the pine source shortly,
and wreaking havoc on it.

Subject: inmail filtering?
Date: 28 Feb 1997 14:27:33 +0100
Message-ID: <5f6mg5$8bu@nidi.ifi.uio.no>


I use Pine 3.91 on a UNIX workstation, and I was wondering if there is some way to
filter incoming email, I'm member of a few mailinglists and since I also have a copy
sent to my Cellular phone with sender and subject it's quite annoying to read thru all 
mailinglist mails also, and since the phone can hold just 5 messages at any time, it's 
pain in the ...

So please if someone can help, please!

BTW: Please send replies to me personally since I dont frequent this list.


On beofrehand thanks,

Subject: Cursor not moving with overlap set to 0
Date: 2 Mar 1997 16:15:08 GMT
Message-ID: <5fc92c$hmu$3@mhafn.production.compuserve.com>

Several weeks ago it was suggested that I set the
overlap to #0 so it would not re-read any of the previous screen.
This is great, however, now my cursor sits on the dateline
of the message and will not move.
I am using speech, and it is helpful to read the current line.
Is their any way to fix this relatively new problem?
Also, when switching from folder-folder, I still 
hear the last item then the current one.
Is their another change I need to make in Pine395
to only hear the current item?
Thank you much for any and all suggestions!

Well, not easily, that is for sure. The relevant options are missing.

I thought maybe tricking pine into using .rnhead as postponed-folder 
and using some initial keystrokes would do. But no, it does not 
recognise it as a proper folder. And how to make sure pine quits when 
you are done?

If you would be satisfied with having to press 'q' after you have sent 
the message, then I think the rest can be done with a surrounding 
script.

Ørjan.

Together?  If you're using Pine, there's no need to use fetchmail.

Check your mail directory (probably ~/Mail) for a file called
	sent-mail-jan-1997
You ought to have been asked whether your old mail should be stored in that
folder. If not, talk to your sysadmin to have that option tagged.

Message-ID: <5f7gtm$1m5q$1@news.missouri.edu>

when we were at aix 414 and pine395, we fixed a problem
where people left looping pine sessions when they signed
off their telnet session improperly. now that we are at
aix 415 and pine395q we have a couple of hundred looping
sessions per day that are expensive to leave running and
expensive to kill (overhead of ps command in kill script).

we can't find the fix we applied -- can anybody help us...

Yes. Metamail (another MIME program) complains, but still shows the message.

Apparently it is due to a slight error in the main Content-Type
field of the error message.

Content-Type: multipart/mixed;;
                Boundary="===========================_ _= 9470520(272)"

There should only be one semicolon at the end of the first line. After fixing 
this both metamail and pine worked fine.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Couldn't this be a proposal for a further release for the
pine/pico-development-team to take care about unexpected systemcrashs in
pico, so that I don't need to change the editor?

Hi-

I wanted to get a quote on the following system:

Intel P166 256K Cache Motherboard and Triton Chipset
HDD Western Digital 2..0 GB
32 MB Ram/Dram
12X CD Rom
1.44 Floppy Drive (panasonic, NEC, TEAC)
Creative Labs Plug and Play Sound Card 64 bit
3-D 64 bit video card with 2MB 

33.6 modem/fax int.
USR
midtower case 250 watts

Monitor - Goldstar Studioworks 78i .26  (17'')

Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard
WIN 95


Could you give me a quote for each part separately as well as the total
system.  I am a student at the University of Washington looking for a
fast solid system with a bunch of memory and great graphics.

I do not want to spend over $1700.
I have gotten a quote for $1695 here in Seattle (not including set up
and tax) Can you beat this quote?

Please let me know

Hello,

Can anyone please explain to me in a step by step manner as to how to use
the block delete commands?  I have tried and failed.

I really appreciate it.

Thanks, Dinesh.

If I got to this URL and select 3.96 I get:

   * Incorporates 3.95 patch
   * Fixes security hole in imapd and ipopd daemons

And if I go to "Pine Release Chronology" and select "Patch for Pine 3.95"
I get:

   A patch for version 3.95 of Pine was made available on 14 Jan. 1997.
   It has been incorporated into Pine 3.96.

Pretty informative ;-)

Probably some description of bugs fixed (and securitiy holes as well)
would still be fine. Also, does IMAP 4.0/4.1 have these securitiy bugs?

I'm not sure about the future plans for including "true" threading, but
you can approximate it at present by sorting your folder into "Ordered
Subject" ordering by typing:

	$ O

when in the Index screen.

If it doesn't work, check to it that you have enabled the necessary
commands in your Pine configuration.

I've been given to understand that Netscape 4 will have client support
for IMAP.  As yet I've seen no reports of success.  Has anyone tried
the NS beta against one of the IMAPDs from the PINE folks?

Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 06:24:45 -0800
X-Priority: 1
X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.0.1457.3)

Hello,

I am looking for a POP3 client for character-based Unix terminals. It
looks like PINE can help me, but I don't understand what is exactly
meant with the below remarks, from the PINE FAQ:

		Pine for Unix can be configured to access the message
INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax
		        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX
		where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. 

==>> However, this method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode,
not in offline mode, which POP was designed for. ==>>Accessing the inbox
on a POP3 server with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags
(New, Answered, Deleted, etc.) between sessions. 

Does that simply mean that PINE requires a permanent TCP/IP connection,
or does it mean it will constantly poll the postoffice ?
Can you please provide some more details ?

thank you

Umm.. sorry to dissapoint you, but I think this is simply not possible in Pine
3.95! In fact, if I am not mistaken, I dont think this 'feature', as it were,
it available in any email MUA out there.

Anyone?

Hello:

An ISP that I use for USENet tells me that their news spool "resides on a
local volume, not on an nntp server."  They further told me that Pine
looks for mail on an nntp server.  Thus, I have to use trn or tin to read
the news.  And, I not as fond of those as I am of Pine.  :)  Is there a
way to get Pine to look for news spools locally and not remotely?

Thanks for the help!

I heard that Pine does not allow this so as to prevent flooding a mail
server with (possibly) hundreds or thousands of messages for a single
user, or for a whole mailing list.  This would obviously create an
administrative nightmare for the recipient(s), and possibly system
administrators, if done maliciously.  On the other hand, some mail servers
will simply reject a piece of mail that is over a certain quota or size
limit, or contains a rather large attachment.  So, forwarding a contiguous
block of mail may not have desirable results either.

I think most mail clients do not allow this so as to protect everyone's
common interests on the 'Net.

Any other thoughts??

It's not currently possible to use IMAP or the syntax used for remote
folders to access remote address books. If you have access to the
addressbook files through a remote filesystem between the systems then you
should be able to use the same file for both.

If you have show-cursor turned on and overlap set to zero, then when you
page forward using SPACE in a long message there should be no repeated
lines and the cursor should be positioned on the first line of text on the
screen. That line will probably be the Date for the first page of the
message but not for subsequent pages.

Under UNIX...

You could try creating a .forward file.
Do something like "man sendmail" for more
info...

Hi,all:

I found pine could not "recognize" some type of e-mails: eg I forward some
e-mail by netscape without attachment but pine think there is attachment.
In fact she just copies the whole e-mail as attachment. It will just
double the length of the e-mail and waste the space.

Thank you.

I think you might get this done by using the apply command and then simply
using the B for bounce command.  I've done this, it works great.

Yeah, really, that's pure gibberish. Damn the bastards who put this on the
net!!! Listen up, you pine devvies! You *really* ought to incorporate a
POP-wizard... With videos, if possible, and Active-X.

POP3 client ... POP3client ... pop3client ... popclient (oi !)

How do I do a "rescan" of a newsgroup, i.e check if new messages has
arrived since I looked last. Now I have to go to another newsgroup and
then back.

My email account has been returning "Disk space Exceeded" statements despite 
the fact I reduced my messages in my inbox from over 500 to just 75.  Is 
this an accurate message or is something else system-wide happening?  I have 
been having progressively more trouble over a three week period.

Thanks for the info Steve.

I was just looking on the IMAP home page and noticed mention of ACAP,
which looks to be exactly what I need to implement the use of remote
addressbooks.  Any idea what sort of schedule there is for
implementation of ACAP in Pine, or if it is planned at all?  The ACAP
home page mentions something about the UW possibly developing their own
implementation of ACAP.

When you refer to a "remote filesystem" are you talking about mounting a
filesystem?  Since I use a local ISP here in Seattle I doubt they'd let
me do that for security reasons.  Or are you referring to something
else?

thanks again,
martin

These "quota"-related question seem to occur at least twice a week.
Shouldn't there be some kind of hint in the FAQ? I couldn't find one.

What you describe as an "email account" is, of course, a directory on a u*ix
system. As a matter of fact, you probably don't just do email with it, but
also ftp, www etc. Therefore, all files you download onto your account (i.e.
onto the part of the hdd that hosts your home directory) affect the amount
of disk space available to you.

Your sysadmin has decided to limit the amount of disk space available to you
to x MB, using a program like quota. The message you're getting doesn't say
"delete emails like hell", but simply tells you that there isn't any space
left in your home directory.

Now, the first thing to do for you is to check your quota. Try man quota for
further info (or whatever "quota" program you're running).
You'll then want to try 

	cd 	#This gets you to you to the top of your home dir
	df	#This tells you how much free space there is right now
	du	#This shows you which dirs take how much space

The last command is especially interesting, since e.g. Netcrap tends to pile
up huge amounts of cached data in a hidden dir ".netscape". Consequently,
you'll want to remove those files/dirs that you don't need and that take
the most space.

Well, since u*ix is an OS (as opposed to DOS, which is just a bunch of
%&(/%!"), you're in for some nasty surprises if you toy around with the rm
(remove) command without reading the instructions first. There is *no*
undelete function. So "man rm" before you decide to do some major pruning.
Be especially cautious about things like
	rm -rf 
unless you intend to start from scratch :-)

You might also nag your sysadmin into re-compiling pine with    

	USE_QUOTAS
          Determines whether quotas are checked on startup. Default is to
          not check the quota.

Robin

This is listed in the online help (and the FAQ?).

I am not sure myself of the exact syntax, but go into Setup/Config, arrow 
down to the news-collections line, and press ^G.

And read to your hearts content.

Now, that's pretty serious. I guess, "fisc quota" is a typo. As a matter of
fact, this phenomenon is usually called a "fish quota", which means that you
have too many fish in your computer. You need to talk to your sysadmin who
will tell you how to get rid of them.

In the meantime, the first thing to do for you is to check your quota. Try
man quota for further info. You'll then want to try

        cd      #This gets you to you to the top of your home dir
        df      #This tells you how much free space there is right now
        du      #This shows you which dirs take how much space

It's pretty easy. All you need is Windows 95, Photoshop, a colour printer, a
sheet of paper and an envelope. As an alternative, you can use a brush and
some paint. On the other hand, you might consider using your mouse-chord to
hang yourself.

Ansi control sequences will CRASH text terminals. Email is *not* intended to

  >How does one use PINE as a POP client?

By reading the manual:

  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
     As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
     Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
     message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax
           
                   {pop3server/pop3}INBOX
                   
     where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
     method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
     mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
     with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
     Deleted, etc.) between sessions.

Robin

first tests are fine.
There is one thing I don't understand:

When selecting the remote folder collection I see a "folder" Mail/
However this is the folders sub directory on the server.
When I try to open I get the error message:

SELECT failed: Can't open mailbox Mail/Mail/: no such folder

Is this a configuration error?

TIA

Hi,

I would like to know if there is daemon one could run to retrieve the
messages from a Unix system, without the need to use inetd. I mean,: is
there a POP3 server that I can run from the command line?

Cool!  Does anyone know if the MS Windows version of pico does
this?  Also, how does pico behave when it's being run as a
standalone program and it's interrupted -- does it auto save the
msg?  A couple suggestions:

 * Have pine send an email message telling the user about
   .pine-interrupted-mail whenever it's created.  This is
   what vi does.

 * Rename .pine-interrupted-mail to .pine-interrupted-msg (or
   .pico-interrupted-msg) since you might be in the midst of 
   composing a news article rather than a mail message.  This
   might help convert people to thinking of Pine as an Internet
   News and Email user agent rather than just an MUA!

Thanks,
Nancy

I'm using Pine 3.95 on an AIX 3.2.5 box.  This works fine most of the
time.  However, there's one apparent bug I've encountered, which I've
reported to the Pine development team (and received an automated response
several weeks ago, nothing else).  I was wondering if anyone here knows a
good solution, or at least a workaround, for this problem.

My news server authenticates users by requesting a Login name/password
pair whenever posting (gawd how I wish more news servers would do this!). 
Thanks to the Pine dev team for including support for this somewhere
between 3.91 and 3.95.  

Anyway, the first time I post to a newsgroup in a given session, all goes
well.  However, usually on second or later posts within a session, when
Pine prompts me for the Login Name, the space is filled with dozens or
hundreds of characters, usually appearing to be a part of post to which I
have responded (it looks pretty garbled in the small "window" made for the
Login Name).  If I hit Ctrl-A (beginning of line) Ctrl-K (kill to end of
line) I can wipe it out and type in my Login Name <enter>, and get a
Password prompt, enter password <enter> and away goes the post just fine.

I've noticed on a small minority of occasions (have not yet identified
what I do that makes these instances different) Pine does *not* insert all
those characters, and instead has my Login Name -- and nothing else --
inserted in the correct place, so I just have to hit enter.

Anyone else experienced this and/or know of a solution or better
workaround??

Thanks.  Email and replies to the group are equally welcome.  I'll
summarize any useful email replies that don't appear in the ng.

-Ken

My folders are not working, and am not able to use pine much at all.

I think the problem stemms from not having my configuration

Any help is appreciated...if I'm even making any sense.

It is still planned but there is no schedule and no work has been done on
it yet. The ACAP spec is still a moving target.

That's right, I was talking about a general purpose remote filesystem. In
your situation there is probably no way to do a remote addressbook with
the current pine.

I have been trying to get PC-Pine to work as a mail client for a Win95 
user.  The user has a PPP / SLIP / Shell account with a local ISP.  I 
have been using PINE on his account through TELNET just fine. (The ISP 
uses a UNIX host)  I have downloaded PC-Pine 16 and 32 bit versions.  I 
have it running just fine as a news reader.  I can't use the e-mail 
portion as it won't attach to the e-mail server at the ISP. Other E-mail 
packages (MS Internet Mail, Eudora, Pegasus, Free Agent, etc.) get in 
just fine.  I am hoping to get PINE working as my user is blind and his 
speech output works best with text oriented programs.

If not PINE, any suggestions?

We have installed Pine 3.96 which claims to have fixed the security hole
in imapd and ipopd daemons.  In the Secure Networks, Inc. advisory, it
states that the problem is with the server_login() routine which is in
log_xxx.c.  The advisory also includes the corrected code.

After building 3.96, I checked log_std.c code, and it appears to be the
same as what SNI calls the flawed code.  Has the security hole been fixed
in some other way such as increasing the size of the username buffer?

Thanks.

    There are some unanswered questions here as to the nature of the
configuration, but I will respond that I do not have this problem, and
I, too, get interrupted sessions from time to time (hangs, glitches in
local power supply that knocksdown my PC, whatever).  I think the
secret to my success is that I do NOT use the Pine built-in composer.

    I use my PC to dial in to a Un*x shell account, where Pine runs. 
In my personal Pine configuration, I have specified an alternate
editor.  (In my case it is an editor called JOE, but other good editors
will have the same capability.)  When something happens to interrupt my
session, Un*x has the good grace to send JOE a signal before blowing
everything away, and JOE writes out the workspace to my current
directory under a reserved filename, preserving my work until I can get
logged back in a recover things.

    Just what Ximena Cearley's configuration is we are not told, but
using a more sophisticated editor may provide recovery capability.

Hi Folks,

I'd like my Pine to fire up Lynx whenever I attempt to view an attached
content-type Text/HTML.  I have entered the following line in ~/.mailcap: 

Text/HTML; lynx %s

Pine just displays the message "[Displaying attachment]" for an instant
then displays the message "[VIEWER command launched]", but it does not
actually launch anything, nor does it let me view the attachment.

What else should I modify to have pine run the external program, in this
case Lynx, and leave it running until I exit that program, and only then
return me to pine?

Thank you in advance.

Joe

Hi, I've been having a problem for weeks, it seems I've tried everything
but nothing works. Here it is:  Whenever I use PINE, the text of one
screen gets written over the text from the previous one, with lines of
text only partly covering the lines that were there before. Also the two
lines of commands, which are supposed to remain at the bottom of the
screen,move up with the rest of the text when I press the space bar to go
to the next page. After three pages I lose any hope of reading what's on
the screen. Even when I type ^L to rewrite the screen, it doesn't work
properly. 
I have tried to check and uncheck different boxes in my computer
but nothing seems to be making any difference. By the way, I use a
Macintosh Performa with 16 megs of Ram, and ZTerm as a modem interface.
Please tell me how to solve this!  Sincerely, 
Sophie Voillot

I was wondering if you know what is wrong with my e-mail.  I haven't
received a message since March 1, and I know several people have e-mailed
me since then.  Do you think that the letters got jammed.  If so will I
ever receive them.  Please let me know if you have any ideas.  Thanks.

Yes.  Instead of changing the flawed code, there is a booby trap in 3.96
to catch people who try to exploit it.  Attempts to trigger the security
hole will never get to the flawed code, but will cause a "Crack attempt"
syslog alert.  Also, the advertised banner did not change in 3.96, to make
it difficult for a bad guy to tell the difference between a vulnerable
3.95 server and a non-vulnerable 3.96 server. 

Perhaps knowledge this might deter bad guys from trying to exploit this
bug.  Then again, those of us who have a life have a hard time in
fathoming the thought processes of those who do not. 

In the as-yet unreleased Pine 4.0 (and the current released imap-4.1
toolkit), the banners changed, so there seemed to be no point in having
the booby trap.  The flawed code is gone entirely in this version.

Unless you have a special reason to continue to run IMAP2bis based 
servers, I recommend that you run the servers in the imap-4.1 toolkit:
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z
since this version supports IMAP4rev1 and POP3 with UIDL.

What happened to the SunOS version of the Pine 3.96
executables?

They are not in the directory like the README file
says they should.

If you are on a Unix host, delete (remove) the .pinerc file in your home
directory, then start pine to create another one with all "facotry"
settings.  If you are on a VMS machine, delete the pine.pinerc file. 

Hope this helps.

Hi there!
	After using Xemacs to read mail, all mail messages which was kept 
	in Pine's inbox  will dispear.  But when go back use Xemacs you can
	see they are still there. It sounds to me that xemacs has marked 
	all message a different way so that Pine could not read them.

	Any help will be appreciated.

	Thanks.

You have probably deleted your 'sent-mail-jan-1997' the first time you 
started pine in February or March. You were asked if you wanted to remove 
that folder to save disk space.

The only way to get it back is to restore it from a backup made back then.

Hello, I have a Mac Color Classic and a 14,400 external modem attached
to it. I am able to dial-in to the University server from home but once
I launch Pine - I have all sort of formatting problems.

The format picks up parts of other messages and retains them and when
reading the mail, doesn't give all of it.

When replying and posting a message, I will be able to type about three
lines then the cursor goes flying several lines above or below and types
till you use the space bar and then it returns to the current typing
line but tabbed about five spaces.

Also when typing all of a sudden it will appear up a few lines and
typing over all ready typed lines.

Also it will automatically highlight section even when you have accessed
that function.

My question is does Pine support a Mac Color Classic dial-in.

I previously was able to use this modem on a Mac SE and it worked out
fine. I'm using the exact same settings and disks on the Classic.

HELP!!!!! If anyone has witnessed this and knows what the cause and
correction is -- PLEASE EMAIL ME PRIVATELY AT namiller@umich.edu

I am at a loss and seriously considering heaving the whole setup out a
third story window - it's so frustrating.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Nancy

Yeeks! Please try not to shout, I can "read" you just fine on this side of the
ocean.  :-)

Seriously, I think this is a question you'll have to take up with the
sys-admins at your site. It appears as though your id on the machine is
hg1b3255, but the program is looking for your mail in hgib3255? (maybe that's
just a typo?)

In any case, check in Setup|Configuration for a value for your inbox-path. It
should point to where your inbox really is. The comment in the .pinerc gives
examples:

# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).
inbox-path=

Hope that helps...

Hi.  I just checked the archive so hopefully my question isn't redundant.

I've lost access to my account here on campus, but my mail address still works. 
A friend of mine lets me use his account, but using Netscape mail is a real
hassle.  What I want to know is if there is a way to access my mailbox from his
account through pine without screwing up his pine access.

I've played around a bit with setup/config and a separate config-file with the
pine -P command, but with no success.

Any help would be appreciated.  Please CC responses to me as well as the
newsgroup.

Hi to the list!

I have a "general" mail address (shown in my .sig) which I forward to my
account in a Unix domain. I do this via a MIME gateway, and after that,
attachments of type Text/PLAIN are not shown. This is somehow troublesome,
because such an attachment usually is the mail text itself, and I always
have to "V"iew (and select) this attachment, and for returning to the
INBOX I must "E"xit the viewer plus "E"xit the index ...

Is this a problem of
1) the mailer (HP Open Mail/MS Mail)
2) the MIME gateway
3) Pine ?

Cheers & TIA

Not much, but don't let that bother you.

There are two alternatives for you:

1. Learn to understand pine. You've made it to the setup --> config menu;
from there, it's only one more step to the help screen. Besides, information
about pine can be obtained from:
	http://www.washington.edu/pine

2. Kick your sysadmin. Unless you've screwed up your menu manually, there's
no reason for pine not to work except wrong default settings by the admin.

Robin

... to continue my most recent mail concerning Text/PLAIN attachments:
I just realized that those mails with "Not shown" attachments are passed
through our "shar" gateway. The ones that are passed correctly through the
MIME gateway have attachments of Text/PLAIN that are always shown. So this
seems to be a mailer and/or gateway problem -- and you all (i.e. Pine users)
need not solve this problem ...

What's that question to do with pine?

Check fetchpop - client to retrieve mail from pop3 server.

	DESCRIPTION
	The  fetchpop  program  retrieves  mail from a remote host using the
	POP3 mail transfer protocol as described in RFC1225 and RFC1081.

Subject: Applications in Pine
Date: 4 Mar 1997 20:57:58 GMT
Message-ID: <5fi2cm$98o$1@apakabar.cc.columbia.edu>

Is it possible to have Pine recognize one type of application as something
else?  In particular, I am being sent PGP files from an exmh user, and they
come to me as type APPLICATION/PGP, which Pine does not recognize.  I
currently have Pine set up to scan text files for the words "-----BEGIN
PGP", in which case it starts the PGP program and decodes them.  But
because it does not recognize the mail that I am being sent as text, it
does not attempt to decode these messages.  So if there is some way that
I could get Pine to recognize these files as text, this problem would be
solved.  Is there some way to do this?  Thanks,

Melissa

Well done for trying!  (It _is_ actually quite a frequently asked/answer

You need to include a "/user=yourusername" switch within the IMAP
specification(s) you are using.  This changes an entry looking like:

	{monet.art.nowhere.edu}INBOX

to:

	{monet.art.nowhere.edu/user=yourusername}INBOX

You may like to consider setting up a "folder-collection" along these
lines to point to your non-INBOX folders, and an additional "incoming
folder" to include your INBOX.  See the Setup Configuration screen's
built-in help for each of the "folder-collections" and
"enable-incoming-folders" variables for more details.

Cheers,

I'd like to know how this is working. You lost your account, but you can
access to your incoming-mailbox from another account. That's very
interesting, so you could get access to every incoming-mailbox on this
cumputer?

Why do you lost your account? And why is your email-address still working?
I mean isn't this something, which is very close together? At least on the
mashines where 've been and I still am is the access to my inbox only
possible for me and the superuser and of course the mailer.

I'd like to know how this is working.

All the best

Heinrich

Helo,
yes, I am running pcpine3.95 (32 bit) on my NT 4.0. It's easy to install
and a have no problems with it. But pcpine is only an online client --
some one may correct me -- and
surely you are intersted to an offline client. 
I have write an disconnected client for windows nt based an pine3.95,
named MobilPine. And
if you are interested, I can ftp you the program. But there may be some
Bugs, and I have it not test on other computers than my homecomputer.

Is it me, I'm not following this. You say that you can't use the backspace
key on you keyboard to delete the offending character?

You can't press ^H or ^D (depending where the cursor is in relationship to
the offending character) to delete it?

Your cursor keys on your keyboard don't move the cursor to the offending
character?

You can't press ^T to invoke the spell checker? 

Pico is the default composer, so whatever your problem is, it is not with
Pine per say.

Perhaps you need to give me more information as I just don't get this.

Sorry,

I usually save one message out to a file, then 
work on the second message (using vi as my alternate
editor) and then read in the file I saved.

    Pine will not do this.  It is not designed to do so.  However, on a
Un*x system there may be more than one way, depending on whether or not
you still have an account on the original system.  For a task like
this, I would recommend that you check with your help desk (if it
exists) or system administrator.

Subject: terminal problems
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am experiencing intermittent difficulties logging onto pine from my home 
computer, a MacII with an older version of MicroPhone, the software that came 
with my SupraFAX v.32bis modem.

A couple of days ago, I received the following message when I typed "pine"
at the prompt:

Your terminal, of type "dumb", is lacking functions needed to run pine.

I was unable to open pine at that point. Hanging up and redialing a couple of 
times, I was able to get into pine as usual.  I have been using pine for three years 
and this is the first time I have seen this message. The terminal settings in my
software are set to VT102/ANSI, which is the closest to VT100 it gets.
Nothing has been changed on my system since I started using pine for the first 
time, except that I  have been using a different service provider for about four 
months. They are unable to help, however.

Can you suggest a course of action?

Thanks

That is ok.

Can you send me email when the executables have bin placed
in the directories so that I do not have to FTP over and
check everyday?

Thanks.

Is or is not the newsrc files portable from PCPine to Unix Pine? I'm
currently having problems sharing them, it makes messages deleted in Unix
Pine showing up as non-deleted in PCPine, which is a bit annoying.

Okay, here's the pertinent section of our local .pinerc file with the 
changes I've used (to no avail).


########################### Essential Parameters ###########################

personal-name=GodfatherofSoul

user-domain=yeager@ksu.edu

smtp-server=(didn't put anything here, but ours is mailhost.ksu.edu or 
localhost).  Speaking of which, what is the difference?  Does local mean 
my friends account, or anywhere here on campus?

nntp-server=

# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).
inbox-path={mailhost.ksu.edu/usr=yeager}INBOX


For all the collection files, I've used paths to a directory marvmail to 
separate my messages from my friends mail directory messages.

So, where is my error?

Hello all,
	My apologies if this is old hat.  I login to my unix account from 
a Macintosh using NCSA Telnet.  I always found that use of CTRL-C in PINE 
caused it to stop running, and returned me to the unix shell.  This was 
particularly frustrating on those occasions when I was aiming for CTRL-X, 
and missed!
	Anyway, the good news is that I discovered how to make CTRL-C 
behave in the expected fashion.  In the Session pulldown menu for Telnet, 
go to Setup Keys; and blank the box labelled "Interrupt Process".
	The thing I have not yet figured out is how to make this change 
permaent.  At present, I have to do it each time I run Telnet.  Anyone 
have any suggestions?

Cheers,

When I get an error message from a mailer daemon which sends it in MIME,
this message is sometimes impossible to read in pine. Try to send a test
mail to somebody@eyi.cz (or something like that - nonsence@eyi.cz, for
example), and you'll see that you don't see the body in pine.. I'm trying
to include such a message as an attachement to this post, if you export
this attachement to a file and then run pine -f on that file, you'll
hopefully get what I get here..

I reported this bug once before, but nobody replied. :-(

You should have created a "Session" to log into a particular Unix box.
Along with that Session, are the parameter options you mentioned. There
should be a Save Preferences or Save Sessions or Save Terminal Options
somewhere inside of NCSA Telnet (I should know because I've done it
before)...

Good luck from a fellow Macintosh user,
Andrew Le

 am trying to use emacs as my alternate editor in pine.
What I get is the message "Invoking Alternate Editor..."
then nothing.
If I stop the process, I can see that an emacs process was indeed
started.  If I kill that process, then pine comes back.

Any thoughts on getting this to work????

Hi, I am a student at a college university working in conjunction with 
the director of computer services.  We are looking for a way to create 
a global addressbook for users of Unix Pine.  We want this addressbook 
to have every user on the system, however, we want to be able to allow 
the students/users to keep their existing addressbook. Is there a way 
to do this???

Thanks,

Hi, I use folders in pine and filter my incoming messages directly to my
folders. Since I have started doing this I don't get beeped any more on
the arrival of new incoming messages to my folder.

However, I do get beeped when I get messages coming into my INBOX when
they are not filtered to any of my folders.

Also, I do get a visual notification through the mail icon about
messages that have arrived in my folder or INBOX.

Does anyone know how I can enable audio notification as well for
messages coming into folders ? I run version 3.91 on HP-UX 9.05 on
HP9000 model 715/33
Thanks,

'Owdy Piners...

I'm running Pine 3.95 (and I just tried it with 3.96, with the 
same results) on a couple unix boxen connected to a Unix box
running IMAP4 from washington..

Things seem to be working AOK, but I can't see a listing of my
folders.  INBOX is okay, but my 'folder-collection' window is
empty, saying "*** Empty List ***   Select here to try
re-expanding"  (which does nothing).

If I change, in my pine/setup/config screen, my 'folder-collections'
path to a local dir (mail/[]), I see the whole list (it's NFS
mounted from this particular workstation).  But if I change
it to {my.mail.server.com}mail/[], i don't see anything.

Whaddamidoinwrong?

Message-ID: <5feq89$ibj$1@brachio.zrz.TU-Berlin.DE>

I've just compiled pine 3.96 on Linux 2.0 (actually a Slackware 3.1
distribution). Now when I start the binary I get the following error
message:

[Error saving configuration in file "/home/schwarz/.pinerc": Unknown
error]

virtually every time I do something with pine (launch, quit,...)

/home/schwarz has the following permissions:

helena schwarz 559 (~/pine3.96): ls -lad ~
drwx------  20 schwarz  users        3072 Mar  3 16:13 /home/schwarz/

There is still enough disk space.
~/.pinerc does not exist (and is not created by pine, probably due to that
error).

On IRIX 5.3 and Ultrix 4.2, where I've also compiled pine 3.96, everything
seems to work fine, as does pine 3.95 on Linux.

Any ideas what could be the reason?

Another way is to select the two messages with the ; (semi-colon) 
command, then apply with the a (letter a) key any action you want 
(export, forward, save, etc.)

I have a problem, and I'm not sure if any of you can help me.  I'm not
actually on the list, so if you have any suggestions, please e-mail them
to me personally.

I've created a distribution list that contains over 3000 addresses.  But,
when I try to compose a message, only the first 160 or so addresses show
up on my screen.  I haven't had a chance to try actually sending the
message.  Will the message go out to all 3000 even though only 160 show up
on my screen?  Or, will it only go to 160?  How do I get the message to go
out to everyone on the list?  Is this a limitation of pine or is it a
limitation of the system?

I appreciate any help...  Thanks you very much.

Dom,

There certainly is.  In the global .pinerc file (I can't remember where 
this is located), set the value global-addressbook=<pathname>.

I presume the director of computer services knows where the global

I am having a problem getting the "clouds" screen to stay intact on thw
Win95 opening screen.  It does not save properly and when I reboot it is
gone.  Any ideas as to what could be the problem?

I'm not sure what is going on. I have used that before to re-scan the group
and it now appears that it isn't working for me either.

Oddly, the last time I used this, it showed all the old deleted messages
for the group (nearly 1700+ old deleted posts) and now it just shows what
has been left as read.

Any one have any ideas?

Thanks,

Try looking in your Preferences -> Sessions menu item and edit the
settings for the session you are using (probably "<Default>").

The error seems to be either a mis-reading or a mis-typing...  I said that
the switch was
	"/user=yourusername"
whereas you seem to have entered
	"/usr=yourusername"

Pine is not an interactive two-way chat program; for that you need to use
a separate program.  On most UNIX systems this other program is called
"talk".

The "allow-talk" option in Pine's Setup Configuration screen controls
whether other people can contact you using the "talk" program whilst you
are running Pine.

By default Pine makes sure these talk-requests are turned off so that its
screen displays aren't messed up by unexpected characters arriving.  If
you turn on the "allow-talk" option you are indicating you are happy to
allow others to request a "talk" session with you and are prepared to have
your screen messed up should they do so.

However to actually accept the connection and communicate with them you
will need to quit out of Pine and use the "talk" command to accept their
talk-request.

All of this is, of course, explained in Pine's own built-in help for the
"allow-talk" option.  If you had bothered to ask it for help (by typing
"?" whilst your cursor was on the "allow-talk" variable name) you would
have seen it for yourself.  :-}

Cheers,

Well, OK, now we know that the header is wrong, but many MTAs send it - as
a listowner I have several of these messages unreadable to pine from time
to time.. I think it pine should make a warning, but display the message
anyway. Or ignore the MIME and display it as if it wasn't in MIME..

The best pop-3, pop-2, IMAP, apop mail collection program I've found is
called 'fetchmail'. It collects the mail from a remote mailbox and puts 
it into a local mailbox or file so it's language is irrelevent.

You can easily fetch the latest version of fetchmail via FTP from:

        ftp://ftp.ccil.org/pub/esr/fetchmail-2.2.tar.gz

Or you can get it from Eric's home page:

        http://www.ccil.org/~esr

It has been pointed out that my analysis was faulty and that Pine does
indeed go into an infinite recursion under the above conditions.  This
bug will be fixed in Pine 4.00.

I'm sorry if this has caused any unnecessary confusion.

1. Check if you have talk installed on your system:
	which talk

2. Check if you have the following. 
	/etc/hosts     to find the recipient's machine
	/var/run/utmp  to find the recipient's tty

3. Talk to your sysadmin or helpdesk, or read the talk man page
	man talk


Enjoy.

Yeah. Start an X session before running emacs or invoke it with the -nw
option.

BTW, it took me 5 minutes to figure it out how to leave that (/%$$%/ program
after I couldn't kill the process. I positively hate you this morning.

Subject: some criticism about pine distribution
Date: 3 Mar 1997 22:35:15 GMT
Message-ID: <5ffjn3$hu6$1@brachio.zrz.TU-Berlin.DE>

While pine definitely is a nice, powerful mailer that, unlike many others,
can handle a lot of encodings correctly, I'd like to take the opportunity
of the new version being just released to voice some criticism regarding
the distribution (intended to be constructive):

- why is the pine source distributed which the debug compiler options
(-g) set?

- when I try to change some compiler options (use -O2 instead of -O) I
have to change no less than four Makefiles. (and first find out where they
are :-)) Isn't it possible to use one "top level" Makefile and pass on the
options to the others?

Hi, I am running Linux on a system with dialup-access to my ISP.
Because of this, my machine has no real Internet-adress, or
registered domain-name. Also, my username on my local machine is of
course not similar to the one at my ISP.

How does one fix the "From:" header in outgoing mail and news to be
correct? (I know I can set "Reply-To:" but it isn't very satisfying
for obvious reasons).

Apparently the terminal type is not being exchanged. I have that 
problem with some terminal software. Presumably the Unix server has 
changed from assuming vt100 by default to assuming dumb.

Alternatively, it does not recognize vt102 as a variant of vt100 any 
more.

>Can you suggest a course of action?

1) Check whether your terminal program has an option somewhat like 
"announce self as VT102" and change that into VT100. This might be 
independent of what type it is actually emulating.

2) If that doesn't work, insert one of the following in your login 
file (both the name of the file, and which command to use, depends on 
your login shell)

setenv TERM vt100
export TERM=vt100

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Ok here's what I did, I took the contents of one folder selected them
all and then copied them to a new folder.  Now the new folder won't
sort the way I have it set up in the config.  I tried sorting using
the '$' command, this works fine, but is only temporary.  As soon as I
quit and start again the sort is screwed up again.  Any help greatly
appreciated. 

Thanks

Sorry, I dont have an answer to your question, but I am just curious, Why,
exactly, are you running Pine in a rxvt? Pine 3.95 does not support colour,
right? So why not just run it in a plain-vanilla 'xterm'?

I use rxvt to run 'slrn', my newsreader which can display different text in
different colours, as per my specifications. i.e. color-support is the *only*
reason I use rxvt. What about you?

    You cannot talk to your friend by Pine.  A talk function is
different from handling email and news, which are the functions of
Pine.  The online help for the allow-talk option explains things very
well.  Turning on this option allows you to be notified if someone
wants to talk to you.  You must then suspend or quit Pine and use
whatever talk program is installed on your system.  At this point you
are no longer using Pine and therefore no longer dealing with the
subject of this nerwsgroup.  Try entering   man talk   or    man ytalk
for further information.

Is it possible using pine, to subscribe to more than one news server. I

Thanks in advance,

This is what I put in our /etc/mailcap - it pulls up lynx whenever one
tries to view an html attachment:

text/html; lynx -force_html %s; needsterminal

The next trick is to have it figure out how to pull up netscape, but
I'll do that in my "spare" time.

Subject: transfering a folder to another local user

Message-ID: <5fo5ee$a37@nr1.toronto.istar.net>

 
Hi folks, This may be trivial, but I don't want to lose the 
mail, so I thought I'd better ask.
I  want to transfer a folder from one user to another user, 
without forwarding each message individually.  This is a 
one shot deal to forward some mail for my girlfreind, 
(whom I've convinced to try using pine to read her mail)


Can I just (as root) mv the files over?  Or will it play 
havoc with my setup? I use pine under Linux and Smail.
Fetchmail grabs our mail and passes it to Smail, 
which sends it to me.  (I'll use procmail, when I get 
more time to read the docs)
Thanks for any help you can offer.

You are correct; I am in error. I made an (unwarranted) assumption regarding
how Pine worked; seems I've made a fool out of myself again! Oh, well.   :/

I *knew* THAT! I was simply indicating that I can't find any other options
that might affect the situation that was described in the original post. I
figured it might be a side-effect of the quell-dead-letter... setting.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I have read the vi[m] and pine FAQs and have not seen this 
particular proglem before.

I would like to pass these (or any other) command-line args to 
my alternate editor:

vi -c "set wm=10"
or
vi "+set wm=10"


Note vi[m] needs the ""s around the whitespace-containing
argument.

I can't figure out how to pass this info off to vi[m] 
from pine. I wouldn't mind setting up another .exrc for 
pine's vi[m], but I can't tell vi[m] where to look for the 
new .exrc without passing it /that/ information.  Square one.

It looks as if pine grunges the handoff and vi[m] thinks there
are multiple files to edit.  :(


Is anyone successfully passing commandline info to vi[m]
(or any other editor) from within pine?

Please email as well as follow-up if possible, as my newsfeed
is tragically unreliable (~30% missing posts compared to 
dejanews).

Thanks.

as I understand it, pine must be compiled to allow you changing the From:
header. The settings the source comes with do not do so. So if you compile
pine out of the box without any adjustments you cannot change From:, if
I'm not mistaken.

The easiest way of finding these out is to read Pine's release notes for
yourself: start Pine (the latest version is 3.96) and, at its Main Menu
screen, give the "R" (Release notes) command.

> Also, is there a 'Auto-reply' facility in Pine?

No... this is a function of the system software responsible for actually
delivering arriving messages into your INBOX, not for mail clients (such
as Pine) which are for reading the e-mail *after* it has been deliverd.

Try checking if there is a program called "vacation" on your system
(assuming you are using a UNIX computer): you should be able to see its
online manual page by typing "man vacation" at your UNIX command prompt.

Cheers,

Hi,

I'm looking for a way to send outgoing mail with an attachment,
all this done through a script which runs automatically through
the Unix cron mechanism.

Is it possible to do it with Pine ?

If yes, what are the command-line options I should use ?

Thanks in advance.

I encountered this myself and have come up with a fix for it (reported and
sent to the Pine Team).

If you're still having problems let me know privately and I'll try and
separate out the changes I made.

   I'm completely unfamiliar with Pine.  My friend would like to know how
   to send attachments.  Does she need to go into Set-Up and configure it
   to find the files in her ClarisWorks program?  Any help would be
   appreciated.  

Just hit ^J while in the header of the message you'll send.

BTW: Read the online help screens, they will give you quite a few hints!

I'm guessing you mean from within pico? It really isn't very hard. The ^6
[Ctrl-6] key combination sets and unsets the mark, (the "start" of the block).
Then you move your cursor to the "end" of the block you wish to work with.
Press ^K [Ctrl-K] to delete the block, and ^U [Ctrl-U] to undelete it.

If you only wanted to copy a block, without deleting it, you would procede as
follows:

- Mark the start of the block.
- move the cursor to the end of the block, (pico highlights the block as you
  go).
- Press ^K, then immediately press ^U.
- Move the cursor to the point where you want to insert the copied text.
- Press ^U.

You can keep pressing ^U as many times as you want and it will keep inserting
the last text that was deleted.

Hope that helps you...

Vim has what are called autocommands that are executed for specific
file-patterns *and* specifific events. Look up :help :au. Here is what I have
in my .vimrc

autocmd! BufRead /tmp/pico.* set fo=tcq2 mls=0
autocmd BufRead /tmp/pico.* nmap i :unmap i<CR>:g/^>[ >	]*$/s//<CR>1GOp<CR><Esc>{dp
autocmd BufRead /tmp/pico.* norm i

As you can see, I 'set' certain options for /tmp/pico.* files which is what
Pine launches when replying/composing a mail. Also, I do some manipulation to
the text-buffer before it is read in to make is easier to edit the reply. For
a new-mail, it does nothing since it is operating on a empty buffer.

I went to help, but there was no info available.  My computer will not
allow me into the INDEX box, although the others can be accessed.  Today
is the first time this has happened, and I am not sure where to go from
here.

Thanks for any help.

The only problem here, I noticed, is that you start a lynx session for
every message read. For example, I replaced lynx with my netscape
browser, but I don't feel like running ump-teen Netscape sessions.
Anyone have any suggestion on working around this? Any way I can get the
document to the already-running copy of Netscape?

Anyone?

Thanks to David Miller, the problem appears to be sendmail dumping core,
causing pine to go into and endless loop and dump core (the endless loop
problem he reports will be fixed in 4.0). Now, to find out why sendmail
is dying...

That's why quoting was invented.  ;-)

Seriously, if you don't make the forwarded mail an attachment,
and if you do not use either quoting or extra line delimiters
then even the forwarded mail will be part of your signature.
And that's even worse.  YMMV.

Personally, I put my sig at the bottom and keep it McQ (up to four lines).
I also avoid forwarding whenever I can.  And when I do, I quote the stuff.

I think there was at least one release of Pine that didn't properly
suppress blank headers.  The current Pine 3.96 release should...

Hi,
	My name is Minh and for some reason I cannot access any of the
newsgroups.  Whenever I try to open a newsgroup it will say "no such
host". I don't know why this is happening.  I used to be able to access
them fine.  This is really confusing- my brother's account works fine and
we are under the same server (the university of Calgary). Can you help
me?? I would appreciated it.

In PC-Pine you define the name in the userid part, and the domain in
user-domain. You don't need to change the From name.

Just make sure that the inbox is defined with a user if the name and login
id are different.

	user-id=dat95pkn
	user-domain=mds.mdh.se
	inbox-path={legolas.mdh.se/user=dat95pkn}INBOX

is what I have.

It should be perfectly safe to strip an application.  The stripped app 
does not generate debugging information if a crash occurs, but most 
users don't debug programs any way.

I doubt that this is a problem with Pine, but maybe someone in this
group has run across it.

Since we upgraded our Sun server to SunOS 5.4, our Pine (3.87) users
have been unable to get mail through to users at aol.com, prodigy.com,
and a couple of junior colleges.  As a workaround, we've told them to
send mail to the name servers that we found with nslookup (e.g.
dns-01.aol.com)  which works okay, but I think we must have clobbered
something during our upgrade.

Any UNIX gurus have helpful ideas for an old mainframe dinosaur?
Reply to newsgroup or either e-addy below (if this question is too
boring for group consumption.)

Thanks.

Try an alias.

alias myeditor='vi -c set wm=10'
and point pine/etc... to myeditor

Think this should work.

Actually, we've set this up and run into a sporadic problem.  We have a
perl script built to rebuild the global addressbook and the .lu file, (and
then copy it to all of our campus hosts) and have it in a
globally-readable but not writeable directory (so far so good).  However,
some (most?) users get a message from pine, after entering an address in
the To: field of the composer, to the effect that they don't have
write-access to the directory of .globaladdressbook.lu, and so it's
rebuilding it in /tmp for them.

WHY?

Since the global addressbook is, by definition, read-only, and the
tech-notes advise us to rebuild the .lu file when the addressbook is
built, why does pine want to rebuild it *every time*?

Very frustrating.

Personally, I never see it, 'cuz I own the .global addressbook, but I have
to answer the questions.... ;(

Greetings

I have a question regarding Pine

Since last night, I have been unable to access any newsgroups while using
the Pine system.  Whenever I use the view command it states "421 SMTP
connection went away!".  What does this mean, and how can it be fixed?

Thank You

Howard Donn

PCPine doesn't support either pop2 or pop3 protocols to retrieve mail.

If you spent more time reading the mailcap manual instead of whining about
some crappy toy like Netcrap not working properly, you would have found this
for lynx:

	test=test -z "$DISPLAY" -a -z "$LYNX_VERSION"; needsterminal

How about working over it with
	sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/netscape
for example.

Sure: www.netscape.com and the mailcap man page.

Hello,

I just installed pine 3.96 on my Sun unsing sunos and noticed the
following problem:

vi is my alternate editor, when piping text from it to other commands
like fmt I get the following error message:

shell-init: could not get current directory: getwd: can't stat .

Also I would like to see an option to set sigdashes.

Best regards

Some places shut down accounts by changing the login shell to 
something like "nologin" without changing anything else.  In other 
words, the password is still there.  Certain server programs, perhaps 
POP and IMAP servers, would not perform a real shell login for the 
user, just check the password, and so could still be used. Ftp too, 
maybe.

Subject: sending mail to pesky compuserve addresses
Date: 7 Mar 1997 16:18:03 GMT
Message-ID: <5fpf3r$g8o@news.bu.edu>

Hi --- I checked info sources and FAQs, but couldn't
find info on this problem:

How does one get around the "," character in Compuserve
e-mail addresses?

If I want to send to xxxxx,yyyy@compuserve.com, Pine
interprets this as a send to xxxxx@<mydomain> and to
yyyy@compuserve.com.  I've tried enclosing it in various
combinations of angle brackets, single- and double-quotes,
all to no avail!

(I seem to remember something about replacing the ","
with a ".", but that's pretty foggy in my memory...)

Thanks for any help you can give, and my apologies
if this is an "old-hat" question.

When I'm using vi to compose a message, I regularly save a
temporary copy of the message using:

 ESCAPE
 :w tmp

Is there any way to do something similar in pico?  The only
possibility seems to be ^O but that postpones the message and
throws you out of compose mode.

Thanks,
Nancy, who has lost messages in the midst of composing them

Does anyone know how to do this in PC Pine for Windows 95?  For
example, I'd like to have the From header of this very message be:

What is the best way to cancel a news message that I posted with
Pine?  The last time I looked into this, you had to construct the
cancel headers yourself -- is that still the case?  If so, what
exactly do I need to put in the headers.  Does anyone know if I can
use another news reader to cancel a message that I posted with
Pine?

Thanks,
Nancy

Subject: PINE insists on "CC"ing me... and I know why!
Message-ID: <oirahrb64n.fsf@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca>
Date: Sat, 8 Mar 1997 00:05:12 GMT


When I'm replying to a message Pine asks me:

"Include original message in Reply?"

which is OK, but _then_ it asks me:

"Reply to all recipients?"

which is not, since this happens with all
messages (even the ones which were only
sent to me). If I respond "y" it CC's me
a copy, otherwise it only sends an email
to the original sender.

How do I tell Pine to stop asking me the
second question when I'm the only one in
the "To:" field?

I just _know_ this is some dumb thing I've
overlooked, but I can't seem to find a way to
fix it...

Specs: Pine 3.96 under IRIX 5.3.

Ooops, OK, I found out! But I think I'll
post this anyway because it took me a while
to figure out and it may help other people:

I'm not sure how the mail thingie is set up,
but I will receive email which is sent to
marco@chinook.physics.utoronto.ca
or
marco@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca

Now, in the configuration I had:
user-domain              = marco@chinook.physics.utoronto.ca

and when answering to email and responding
"y" to "Reply to all recipients?" Pine CC'd
a copy of the message to:
marco@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca

Thus, I changed the config to:
user-domain              = marco@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca

and now Pine behaves as expected (i.e.
it doesn't ask if I want to CC myself).

One thing is that apparently the "Reply-To:"
is set to marco@atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca,
so that Pine thought there was a third person
involved (given that the user-domain had the
chinook address). _However_, all the above had
been the same for a while now (the chinook/
atmosp dichotomy) and Pine behaved "normally".
What happened? Well, all this began when I
upgraded to 3.96, so methinks there lies the
source of this new phenomenon.

O.K., perhaps you'll now call me "master of the
obvious", but I didn't think so at the time :)

Cheers!

Judging from the symptoms you're describing, I suspect that it's either the
CIA or the Mossad. You might complain to the President of your country,
that's the normal way. 
As for the suspected alteration: the German Secret Service makes use of the
full moon phase, when they employ moonlight driven laser beams to intercept
the email messages of law abiding citizens.

Add ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM among the compile-time options in
pine/makefile.lnx, and then re-compile.

CFLAGS=      $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) $(EXTRACFLAGS) $(STDCFLAGS) -DALLOW_CHANGING_FROM

is what I changed, and here it works (From is dat95pkn@idt.mdh.se, Sender

Hi:

If I have selected several messages with ";" and then want to print them
out, they all run together.

How can I get each message to begin at the top of a page in such as
aggregate operation?

TIA for any help.

It's already there.  From the main menu, go into Setup/Config.  Find
the option "signature-at-bottom" and turn it on.  Exit and save the
configuration.

Does anyone know how to find that screen?

    It means just what it says.  The SMTP connection went away.  That
has nothing to do with Pine, but without the connection Pine cannot
read newsgroups if it is hooked in via an SMTP connection.  About all
you can do is wait until somebody fixes it.  If they don't already know
about it, try notifying your help desk, operations center, or system
administrator.  Most likely, it is not something you can fix by
yourself.

Yes, just enter the name(s) in the Bcc field and leave the To field blank.

Create a filed called ".signature" (not including the quotation marks) in
your home directory on the machine you are reading your mail, and it will
be automatically included in all the messages you write with Pine.

This is the most obnoxiously, irresponsible, and childish response to a
generally benign post that anyone could image.

If you have enough free time to respond, maybe you should take a minute to
actually help.

Something must have changed between Pine 3.91 and 3.95 (for the worse).
I run zmailer 2.99.43 on my Linux system (kernel 2.0.29, libc 5.2.18,
ncurses 3.0), and have tried both pine 3.95 and 3.96, and they both
hang (stay at 0%) whenever I *send* mail.  (Reading mail works fine.)
I have yet to take a real look in the sources at what it really does
when sending mail.

Has anyone successfully used Pine 3.95+ on a system running zmailer?

Does the .pine-debug1 file shed any additional light on the problem? 
It should include some additional information, like the full pathname
of the file it was trying to open...

I suppose you are using ms-windows, or mac?!
if you are using Unix from school, probably get the lab consultent to
help

if you are using "netscape navigator" under "option", "mail&news
preferance", "servers", check the entry on your "news server name"
should be "news.calgary.edu" , or "news.calgary.ca"somthing like
that.......

The command is:

	text/html; netscape -remote 'openfile('%s')';

and it took me exactly 7 minutes to figure it out. Here's how:

	1) netscape -h tells you:
		-remote <remote-command>  
		to execute a command in an already-running Netscape process.
		For more info, see
		http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html

	2) got x-remote.html (see above a) )

	3) *read* it

	4) cursed the morons at netscape.com for their gibberish

	5) toyed with /etc/mailcap for 2 minutes (see above b) )

	6) done.

So, dear Luis Hernandez, instead of whining publicly, why didn't you go
ahead and found that out yourself. Get a life---this is the pine user list,
not the netrape loser list.


Cheers,
Robin

We run both the Unix and VMS versions of Pine here. The previous version
(3.91) worked fine on both systems. When we upgraded to 3.95, we
discovered a problem: the VMS Pine refuses to allow a dollar-sign
character ($) in the printer setup string. (We send VMS Pine output to a
Unix printqueue.) 

Is there a configuration item within or without Pine that will allow this
character within the setup string?

Thanks for help anyone con provide!

First start by going into "Compose".

THEN go to your addressbook.

Hit "L" for ListMode and those [ ] that you're looking for should appear.

Message-ID: <5fn756$4i4@hobbes.cc.uga.edu>

	I'm having problems getting VMS Pine to run.  I'm using VMS Pine
V3-91_Beta11 from Andy Harper in the UK.  I'm trying to run it on a DEC 3000/400
Alpha running VMS V6.2, UCX V4.1 ECO2 & MX V4.2.  The build went fine with
no compile or link errors.  I'm trying to run PINE from the system account
and get the following error:

the end of the .pine-crash file has the following:

I haven't heard of any cancel command in pine yet.
If I remember correctly the headers are:

Control: cancel <old-message-id>
Subject: cmsg <old-message-id>

If you want to replace the message, you should also be able to use

Supersedes: <old-message-id>

(In fact I thought of this after originally posting so this message 
will contain that header.)

I am pretty sure you can, just as long as the sender address is the same.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

	Don't leave the To: field blank!  If you do so there is a good
chance the MTA will add the line "Apparently-To:" and place all the
names from the Bcc: list on that line.

	The "best" thing to do is upgrade to pine3.96 and use the 
Lcc: line.  (There are other options....but the upgrade to 3.96 has
other benifits as well).

When I attempt to use the "-r#" command line option in Pico

Since it is my understanding that this option was added a 
year or so ago, I wonder if the Pico Version 2.5 that my 
ISP is running predates the addition of this option.

Could anyone tell me the current PICO version number?

Thanks.

My friend uses Pine which I'm completely unfamiliar with. She is trying

does not find a file.  Does she need to do something in her Set-up for
Pine to find the file? Thanks for the help

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection

Hi all,

I like to use pine as my mail reader (it is so much nicer than Sun's
mailtool :-)

Anyway, when people send me attachments (e.g. frame maker files)
it is no problem for me to pipe the mail to uuexplode and extract the
file(s).

However, the difficulty is that if I send attachments from within 
pine (which is MIME compliant) then people using Sun's mailtool
have difficulty reading them :-(

Does anyone know of a fix/patch/solution for me to send attachments
from within pine, so that people using Sun's mailtool can easily
read them ?

Oh, I am using Pine 3.90, on a Sun Sparc, with Solaris 2.4
and the version on Sun's mailtool is ver 3.4

Thanks,

/Mike B.

Good idea.

I made the alias, then tested the alias from the command 
line.  Started pine and made the change to myeditor, saved,
and re-started pine.

Pine chokes and says "Alternate editor abnormally terminated (255)".
I searched for this errormessage in the newsgroups and found
no other references for it.


Anyone know of a workaround?

Well, then, what you have to do then is to recompile the program, with
that flag turned on. Then you will be able to do just that.

What shell is the computer you log into running?
If you don't know, try:
echo $SHELL
or use finger:
finger nbro
and look under "Shell:".

If you are using "sh" try:
TERM=vt100
for "csh" try:
setenv TERM vt100
for "bash" try:
export TERM=vt100

For other shells try "man yourshell" (e.g. man bash)
and check out how you can set the TERM environmental
variable...

I am using Telemate in DOS as my e-mail handler.

How do I send a file from the "A" drive to where my reader is on 
the "C" drive?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Is it possible for me to send a mail to a group of people
such that the recipient list is suppressed?
i.e., none of the recipients should know the other recipients?

Help will be appreciated.

    That is *exactly* what you do -- replace the comma with a period.

Or make ~/bin/myeditor the shell script

Remember to chmod +x ~/bin/myeditor
Also, $HOME/bin needs to be in your $PATH.

Yep, presumably everyone who posted lately. I sent a message to 
siemens.co.at and cac.washington.edu about it.

As usual, I got a nice response back from the latter, but I appear to 
have sent it to the wrong place.  Who is the maintainer of pine-info 
really?

I seem to recall that owner-pine-info bounced when I tried it.

Does anyone know a work around for PC-Pine to receive email from a backend
that doesn't have imap?  My ISP (IDT at 201 928 1000   www.idt.net) says
they don't have IMAP of any kind, but do have POP.  Does anyone know of a
work around? 

Thank you

Yes, that's it. It's the Pine/PC-Pine sources (they are the same).

  I tried it against IMAP2bis, and that didn't work. 
  
  Communicator expects IMAP4, and so alot of "BAD Bogus attribute list
  in FETCH" dialogs appear, and you get to play whack-a-mole.

How could a second inbox, "IN-B", which was made in my Incoming Message
Folders area, be deleted and stay deleted?  So that it does not reappear
next time I start PINE? 

Thanks in advance.

I have created my own mess, but I hope some of you experienced Pine
users can help me.
 
I set up several Distribution lists in my adderssbook but since I am
always taking the easy way, I used nicknames in setting them up.
 
Now I need to list the people on several distribution lists.
for the club officers, like on the Rich view.
 
Is it possible to create a file of the Rich view, or will I have to
reenter the full addresses on the Dist Lists?.

Somebody complained about the Message-IDs of my mails and news articles

I have seen complete pine Message-IDs from other sites:

How does pine compose the Message-ID? Which (environment) variables are

to interfere with the system administration?

If you are using PC-Pine then this has an option to remember your password
(in a file on disk) for use in the future.  You should only use this
option if access to your disk store is secure, as the stored password is
only lightly encrypted (if at all) if memory serves.

If you are using the UNIX version of Pine then there is no option to
remember your password.  Instead you must ask your Systems Administrator
if they have/are willing to set up a "pre-authenticated version of the
IMAP server software".  This is straightforward to do in most cases (the
creation of one symbolic link on the IMAP server machine, provided the
SysAdmin is happy that there are no security issues involved.

If you want to print several messages in one go (using the Select and
Apply aggregate commands) with formfeeds between you first need to set a
couple of things in the Setup Configuration screen:

1.  Request a formfeed between the messages by setting the variable
    called:

	print-formfeed-between-message

2.  Now mutter under your breath about an obscure bug in Pine 3.95 and
    also turn on this variable:

	print-includes-from-line

In Pine 3.95 you need to set *both* of these variables, even though the
first is _apparently_ all you need to set.  This is due to a small buglet
in the source code.

This problem was reported a while back and will apparently be fixed in
Pine 4.0, when setting the first variable will suffice.  It *may* be fixed
in 3.96 (I don't know as I'm not running it here yet; if anyone knows one
way or the other perhaps they could say?) 

Cheers,

I think the latter should actually read:

Subject: cmsg cancel <old-message-id>

In fact I've found that the Subject line is sufficient (at least, it is
for our INN-based server).

Aaarrgghhh!!  It really isn't wise setting the suer-domain variable to
your e-mail address; an extract from the built-in help for user-domain
says:

    This value specifies the domain part (right-hand side) of your return
    address on outgoing email and is also used as the default domain for
    email composed to a local user.

That is, it is intended to hold your *machine name* (the bit to the right
of the "@" sign.

I *strongly* suggest you change this back to what it used to be, and then
use the correct way of telling Pine about your alternative e-mail
addresses....

You're getting asked whether you want to "reply to all" because Pine isn't
recognising your e-mail address in amongst those listed in the headers of
the message you received.  In particular it has no way of knowing that the
same username on your chinook and atmosp computers are both you (and
probably end up in the same mailbox).

So what you need to do is tell Pine that their are other addresses which
people can use to e-mail you and will arrive in your INBOX.  This is what
the "alt-addresses" variable is for.

Find alt-addresses in the Setup Configuration screen, then have a read of
its built-in help by putting your cursor on it and then typing "?".

Cheers,

I have recently got an Internet Shell account and am enjoying using PINE 


for e-mail. 

                               My Problem

                               ----------

In the COMPOSE screen instead of typing the text, I use the SEND command 

to  transfer text which I have written off line using Word Star.  I save 

the letter in non-document mode to get the ASCII format.


Now  for some reason Pine inserts a blank at every line.  So a  30  line 

email becomes 60. I use the ^N & ^K to remove the blank lines.


Can you tell me what mistake I am making and how do I avoid getting  the 

blank lines.


I use Comit communication program under Win-95.


Thanks and best wishes. Arup Bose

P.S. I have not removed the blanks

Sendmail doesn't necessarily have to be dumping core for this to happen.
If it doesn't do the -bs option this will happen, even if it prints a nice
error message and exits cleanly. It should be easy to work around this
problem by setting pine's smtp-server to localhost or to some other host
running an smtp server. In those cases sendmail does not get called
directly.

Vim has what are called autocommands that are executed for specific
file-patterns *and* specifific events. Look up :help :au. Here is what I have
in my .vimrc

autocmd! BufRead /tmp/pico.* set fo=tcq2 mls=0
autocmd BufRead /tmp/pico.* nmap i :unmap i<CR>:g/^>[ >	]*$/s//<CR>1GOp<CR><Esc>{dp
autocmd BufRead /tmp/pico.* norm i

As you can see, I 'set' certain options for /tmp/pico.* files which is what
Pine launches when replying/composing a mail. Also, I do some manipulation to
the text-buffer before it is read in to make is easier to edit the reply. For
a new-mail, it does nothing since it is operating on a empty buffer.

You wont be sorry. Vim is a truly superb editor with full-Vi-compatibility!

I was just writing to ask if, when I send out a msg to my list, can I do
anything about the display of the address so it will only display the
addresses of the recipients and their full names will not be displayed
therefore making it quicker for the recipients to get to the msg instead
of scrolling down a couple of pages of addresses?

Tell her to start Pine, select setup, select config, and set the
user-domain value to whatever should appear after the "@" in the email
address.

That's all I needed when I had the opposite problem.

It might save time, though, to tell her that it's normal for most of the
items found on the config screen to have no value set.

Our mail system at work is built around Microsoft Exchange.  It uses a
SMTP server on a NT machine.  Everybody hates the Exchange mail program.
I use Pine on my personal net account, and love it.

Is it possible to run PC-Pine under Win 95 and Exchange?  I tried
installing it, but am at a loss as to what to do when it wants the IMAP
stuff for the inbox.

Thanks in advance for any help.

I have a randomizer written in perl to pick a random signature file
and print it to the screen.  Is there a way I could set the "Signature
file" in the Setup/Config for Pine to run this program and save the
output to the signature of the Composed mail message?

IMAP support is required for PC-Pine at this time, and while IMAP support
is under development for the Exchange server, it is not yet available...

You can configure your needs. Type 'S','C' in the main screen and see HELP
on items 'sending-filters' and 'compose-send-offers-first-filter'.
Sending filters are commands, e.g. your randomizer. 

sending-filters=~/bin/randomizer  _TMPFILE_  _RESULTFILE_

Hope, this could help.

When I use pine on my personal linux environment to send a message (even
to other users on my machine), Pine waits till my PPP session
automatically starts up and gets established before it passes it off to
sendmail which is running locally.  BTW, nothing gets sent over the link
till sendmail does its job a couple of seconds later as expected.  I have
smtp-server set to "" in my pine.conf file and I get the same results if i
leave it undefined, as it was by default.  At present, I am using the
default network time outvalue; I am wondering now what would happen if I
set it to five seconds, the minimum value.  Keep in mind, I am not using a
remote mail server to post outgoing mail.  I am using sendmail with a
complete set of rules for normal unix mail operation.  

My PPP session automatically starts up when the dynamic modules for TCP/IP
and PPP are accessed by any program; it is quite apparent that Pine is
engaging these modules prior to sendmail.  I would figure that sendmail
would do this on its own and pine shouldn't even concern itself with
establishment of a network connection at this point.  Further proof of
this is shown by the status line showing 0% and that sits there till the
connection is setup and my PPP session is completely started and then it
is immediately handed off to sendmail successfully.  Yes, my logs show
that sendmail handled the mail.

Does anyone have any ideas? Might I be missing something?

I could attach the config files for pine, but I'm not sure if that's such
a good idea on a list.  Let me know if anyone wants to see them, and I
will gladly send them individually.
I'm not currently subscribed to the list, so cc'ing to me would be
appreciated.  Thank you for the help,
<Steve> Holmes (local system administrator)

I'v noticed on PINE 3.95q, that the tab
completion works when reading a file into the
message body (^R), but not when attaching files
(^J)

Is this an oversight?

I have tried three times to send a message to: cici@nature.berkeley.edu
and somehow the address has been changed to cic@nature.berkeley.edu which
is a non-existent address.  Can you correct the problem?  Thank you.  Gwen

Dear Sir,

I am a new user of Internet and I am having trouble sending E-mail.
Most of my E-mail are returned with the following transcript :

        554 rewrite : map @ not found

Can anyone tell me what can be the cause for this error?

Please mail me individually as I have not yet subscribed to the list.

I am trying to build a realistic test for when our system is running slow. 
Since pine accounts for about 75% of the system use, I thought a simple
pine run would be an excellent thing to time.  I attempted to use pine
(3.95) via -I from a perl script being run by cron from an account with 4
or more messages in its inbox. It produced the following mail:

  Your "cron" job

  /usr/local/bin/pine -I i,j,4,CR,v,q,y,CR

  produced the following output:

  Can't access terminal or input is not a terminal. Redirection of 
  standard input is not allowed. For example "pine < file" doesn't work.

Is there anyway to get around pine's strong desire to have a real tty?

I have been using pine heavily for quite some time on OSF1/3.2 and
so have a lot of users here.  I haven't seen this problem at all.

Do those users have something in their .login, .cshrc, .profile, etc.
files that causes output to happen when the command
	rsh serverhost /etc/rimapd
is done?  99 times out of 100, that's the explanation.

Sigh.  Do it one way, people complain; do it the other way, other people
complain.

By default, the mbox driver is enabled in imap-4.1.  If you have a file
called "mbox" on the home directory, the mbox driver will move mail from
the mail spool to that file.  To disable this behavior, delete mbox from
DRIVERS in the c-client makefile (imap-4.1/src/osdep/unix/Makefile)

We are preparing to move the pine-info mailing list to a different
server.  When this move happens, there will be a slight change in the
headers generated by the list management software.  If you are using
procmail, filter, or some other delivery filter, please check your
configuration to see if it depends on the pine-info@cac.washington.edu
address.  These will be changing to pine-info@u.washington.edu.  You
can continue sending messages to pine-info@cac.washington.edu as they
will be routed to pine-info@u.washington.edu. 

Future subscribe and unsubscribe requests should be directed to
listproc@u.washington.edu rather than majordomo@cac.washington.edu.
All current subscriptions will be moved automatically, so you do not
need to do anything to be moved. 

We do not expect comp.mail.pine readers to be affected by this change.

Please send any questions or concerns to
owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu.  

Thanks!

Please help !

I am trying to get the sco unix version of pine.  While I am moderately 
conversant with sco unix, i'm not a unix ace by any means.  I can't
figure out where or whether the source or binaries are on the washington
site.  I am ready willing and anxious to compensate somebody who knows
the ropes and can get me over the hump.  please refer this message as
necessary.

Thanks much...it makes me ecstatic! Hmm, I wonder where it generated the 
97.3 and whether it will be replaced on April fools day! We will see 
after I perform the surgery you suggest...I wonder how they will handle 
the year 2000 problem also! (I plan to edit to make it 99.9!)

When addressing a message to an addressbook list, is it possible to
suppress the addresses that appear in the To: field, such that the
recipients only see the addressbook list name and not all of the addresses
that the message is sent to?

Here's my humble wish list, after using Pine 3.95 for about four months
now (good product):

1. Kill feature + killfiles, so I could kill a whole email (or news)
thread.
2. Notification of how many emails are in a folder, so I know it's worth
opening it or not. The INBOX should also automatically update the list.
3. Rearrangement of the folders, so I could place the most accesed ones,
including newsgroups, on the top, and tab would take me through them in
the right order.
4. More non-mode states, if I want to delete all the files marked for
deletion, I should not need to use the Y/N dialog, this is mostly for
expert users. Or a combination key, such as shift-X would just kill all
the files without the dialogue.
5. Anything that makes it faster to read/scan/respond to files. This is
another case where when I want to respond, I have to go through another
dialogue that asks for all kinds of things. If possible I want to bypass
this all together, using my own default values.
6. The Address book should be able to handle alias names with spaces
between, style John Doe instead of John_Doe.
7. When I import files, the automatic indentation of pico is mostly a
nuisance, it should be not default when importing.
8. Better clipboard support, it's pretty tough just now to copy and paste
together emails from various mailboxes, unless I use another window for
this.
9. In pico, bind the selection point to the classical meta-space, the
current binding just confuses anyone who is used to xemacs/gnu emacs.



Hope this helps, Kent

Nope, it is quite general Unix: & commands don't get the parent's 
standard input.  Otherwise they would lock up the terminal in normal 
use, just the opposite of their purpose.

Pine cannot continue with anything until it has written the entire 
message into the pipe, since it is not multithreaded. (With the 
exception of the experimental background-sending.) So I don't see how 
what you are trying can work even if you can grab the input. You 
cannot reduce the time needed to cat.

However, if what you really want is to do something else with the 
file, you can pipe into a script like the following:

----
#!/bin/sh
cat > file.txt
myheavydutycommand file.txt &
----

Then at least you can continue after the cat.

Now if someone could make pine multithreaded so we could avoid 
those long pauses at mailbox update..

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Me too.  This is a pretty big project though and we have several big
projects ahead of it on our to-do list :-(

For mail, I suggest procmail, filter, or some other delivery filter...

The last time we tested something like this it was horrendously slow. 
Recent changes in the c-client library (driven by IMAP protocol
changes) may make this more feasible now...

It would be nice to have it a little easier to rearrange your
incoming-folders list.  Right now you have to manually edit your
.pinerc file...

Check the expunge-without-confirm feature in the Setup/Config screen.

Not sure what you are referring to here.  Again, check the
Setup/Config screen.

Are you referring to line wrapping?

Are you using Unix Pine or PC-Pine?

David, thanks for the quick response.

I'm using procmail all the time, but the issue is to kill a thread in the
mailbox that I don't want to read. There was some code floating around
with a killfile implementation, but I tried installing it, and it causes a
crashes, so it was not that well-done. I could send you the pointer if you
are interested.

OK, I see. Just having an N flag in front of the folder would be nice, or
have the folder name highlighted by vt100 bold settings or such.

OK, will do, with the exception of .newsrc and .pinerc, sometimes I would
like to mix-and-match the entries so that the tab-order goes through the
most accessed mailboxes and newsgroups.

I'm mostly talking about all kinds of dialogues asking me about really

No, more to the fact that I can't save address book entries with a space.
That's also flagged by the UI.

I'm actually using both, but I was talking about UNIX Pine. Best would be
a way to have two mail entries open at the same time.
 
Here are a couple of other ones I forgot about:
10. Global search via grep and mailfolders.
11. directories in the mail directory with valid mailboxes could be
scanned and marked as real mailboxes, to avoid a cluttered/flat mail
directory.


Thx! --Kent

Hi !

How can I tell Pine to use the ISO-8859-1 Charset and 8-Bit 
Encoding, instead of US-ASCII and 7 bits ??

"character-set=iso-8859-1" in .pinerc doesn't work, and
the manual can't tell me more than setting the "character-set"
option.

Greetinx, Heinz.

    Go into your configuration and read the online help for the
print-formfeed-between-messages option and see if this is what 
you're looking for.  (I've never used it myself.)

    A signature is a small file which is automatically included in your
mail (or newsgroup postings) to sign your message.  Some people think
they should draw cutesy-pie signature files, but other people think
this is bad taste.  With Pine (not necessarily so with other mailers),
the signature file is included in the message you are composing in such
a way that you can edit it like any other part of your message if you
want.  A signature file is merely a plain text file composed with a text
editor (like Pico).

    On Un*x systems, the signature file is customarily named .signature
(note carefully the leading period) and located in your home directory
by default.  (I am not accustomed to other systems.)  Go into your
personal configuration and read the online help for the entries
personal-signature (I think it is called) and signature-at-bottom to
see whether you want or need to make use of these options.

I'm new to the group and did not have access to all the posts on the
"From:-" discussion, so please bear with me.

I'm running Pine 3.93 on a Digital Unix system. I have a similiar problem
with the news portion on Pine when I create a post; The To: field has:

3 Mar  5 To: alt.test.my                 is the "To" corrected
4 Mar  5 To: alt.test.my                 Re: this is the subject line
5 Mar  4 To: alt.test.my                 this is the subject line

The email/name does not appear in the From: field like:

52 Mar  5 Ross Toth                      one more test
53 Mar  5 ross toth                      test
54 Mar  3 Richard P Johnson              Ignore

This only occurs with news, mail works fine. It also only occurs to the
author of the post in Pine, reading the news using another news
reader (like Netscape) or as another user shows the correct name/email
address.

Do I have the same problem and therefore have to recompile using the
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM option?? 

Or is this a different problem.

Thanks in advance,
DCS

We have some groups using SSL to improve the authentication of the
r-services, and provide encrypted sessions as well.  I would be
interested to hear any horror (or success :-) stories with this
approach.

I saw your message about using an imagewriter on a PC.  Where did you
get the drivers to do that, and are there problems besides not being
able to print in color?
thanks rollin

You might try to check under Setup/Config whether nntp-server is set 
to the correct host. It should probably be news.ucalgary.ca (which I 
just checked exists.)

If not, then maybe you have a nameserver problem. Just here the other 
day the nameserver program on my login host died and I had the same 
problem as you did.

If that is the case, you can temporarily do as I did and put the IP 
number as nntp-server: 136.159.200.201.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

It receives the environment, but only as much as environment
variables.  Aliases are often not carried through when executing a
second shell: pine neither gets them nor would know what to do with
them if it did.

Depending on whether pine uses exec or system, it could even require
that the editor be a script or executable.

For all he knew, maybe you didn't _want_ to receive your email.  After
all, the number of people who munge all email addresses in their
postings grows every day.

It's saying this becasue you have exceeded your disk quota, i.e the amount
of data you are allowed to save on the disk where your home directory
resides. Remove some of the files in your home directory, and you should
be able to store more data.

It's not a problem with Pine.

Please note that the original suggestion of setting the
"last-time-prune-questioned" to 99.12 is actually _later_ then your
amended version of 99.9 ... "99.12" means "the 12th month of 1999"
(December), whereas "99.9" is only "the 9th month of 1999" (September).

As for year 2000 concerns I believe there is no need to worry.  Most
people (myself included at one point) assume that the "99" comes from the
last two digits of the year number, and hence will wrap around to "00" in
the year 2000.  This would indeed suffer from the so-called Millenium Bug.

However I now understand that the year figure Pine uses is actually
plucked out of the time structures supplied by UNIX (I can't speak for
PC-Pine).  The year field of the "tm" structure is certainly documented as
being:

	int  tm_year;  /* years since 1900 */

In other words, in the year 2000 it will return the value "100".  Thus
Pine's "last-time-prune-questioned" will continue on from "99.12" to
"100.01" and not suffer the Millenium Bug.

[Disclaimer: The above is just information I've gathered from the previous
times this question has been asked and answered here, and from UNIX man
pages. :-]

Cheers,

(Most of us on this list wish we had a pind/dollar/unit-of-local-currency
for every time this question has been asked and answered! :-)

The "To: newsgroupname" and "To: recipientaddress" is only visible to you
in _your_ index screen.  Everyone else sees the message as being from you,
with your details in place.

Pine is trying to be helpful.  It assumes that you know your own name, and
hence that it can merely *imply* the message originates from you by the
presence of the word "To:".  The remainder of the space is then used to
show the details of the first recipient (for e-mailed messages) or the
newsgroup name (for messages sent only to a newsgroup).

This is actually described in the built-in help for the Folder Index
screen.  Try typing a "?" whilst on that screen to see this, and look for
a description of the "SENDER" column.

The feature is fantastically useful if you keep copies of the messages in
folders, along with any replies you recieve.  For example in my "Pine"
folder I can quickly spot in the Index any messages I have sent to other
people.

If you really can't live with this feature then it _is_ possible to alter
it.  Try investingating the "index-format" variable in the Setup
Configuration screen.  It, too, has built-in help; this should be
sufficient to let you work out what needs to be done.

If you _aren't_ seeing this effect then the e-mail address Pine thinks "is
you" may not be exactly matching your address in received messages.  Try
adding any such alternative addresses to the "alt-addresses" variable,
also in the Setup Configuration screen.

Cheers,

Assuming you are using Pine 3.95 or later...

1.  Start your message by giving the Compose command, but _don't_ put
    anything in the "To:" field.

2.  Put your cursor on a header line.

3.  Give the Rich Headers (^R) command to see all the available headers.

4.  Give the e-mail address(es) in the "Bcc:" field.  If you are using a
    Distribution List from your Pine address book type its name into the
    "Lcc:" field instead.

5.  Carry on with a Subject line and the message text as usual, then send
    the message.

Note: In earlier versions of Pine (eg, 3.91) the Bcc field existed, but
not the Lcc field.  There was also a problem with some mail delivery
software if the "To:" field was left empty: they would still reveal the
recipients by converting the "Bcc" list to "Apparently-to" header lines
(sigh).  Pine 3.95 onwards fix this by inserting "Undisclosed recipients"
in the "To" field if it is left empty.

Cheers,

Hi, I just thought I would throw out a selfish request for more
Pine and Lynx interoperability in their Unix implementations.
For example, it'd be really cool to be reading a message with a
URL in pine, and then be able to hit "J" for jump (or whatever)
and have pine present you with a list of every URL in the message
the same way that it extracts addresses with the "Take" command.


Then you could select the URL if there were more than one, and
Pine would automatically spawn Lynx.  Oila!

Of course, ideally (for my own selfish self) I'd like to see some
interface consistency between Pine, Lynx, and Tin, at least as
far as cursor key navigation is concerned.


For what it's worth,

Please, consider my feature requests also

1. Separate .newsrc files for different nntp-servers/news-collections
	If the same group is accessible from the different nntp
	servers, the different articles' numeration confuses pine.
	I want to be subscribed to the group only at one of the
	servers.

2. More control on the text encoding. Ability to explicitly 
   cancel BASE64 encoding separately for the body of the
   message and some fields, namely "Subject: " and "From: "
	Only one third of the world use the Latin alphabet.
	For the rest of them, e.g in Russia and China, Israel and
	Arab countries, most of Indian states, the forced encoding
	causes the incompatibility between the different software.
	If some user asks for the cancelling of the encoding, he
	knows what he is doing, because that is the problem he
	encounters every time he is sending a letter in his native
	language.

3. Ability to change the value of the "charset=XXXX" in the value
   of "Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=....
	Currently I can't put "Content-Type: " in the list of the
	customised headers, because it is automatically determined
	by character-set=XXXX in .pinerc, and I use ISO-8859-1,
	ISO-8859-8 and KOI8-R. The latter may be critical for me,
	because some local news nodes do recoding between KOI8-R
	and CP-1251 or ISO-8859-5 depending on the local standards.

 From the Holy Land, with respect

We are using PCPINE (16-bit winsock version 3.95 & we've tried 3.96) on
PC's running Dos 6.x and Windows 3.11.  Currently, we are trying to 
run the program from a VINES server on a network mounted drive and
we do at this time have full write access to that directory.

When we access our global addressbook file it will load, but it's
R E A L  S L O W to react to keyboard commands once it has expanded.

When the file is small it works okay, but when it's expanded to our
complete global address book with about 4,500 entries, it takes
a windows machine logged in and running about 80 to 90 seconds to
respond to one keystroke in the, "AddressBook" screen.

Are there any ways to speed this situation up?  (We are migrating
from VINES mail off of a Vines network that has a streettalk
database and its mail listing or global addressbook, comes up in
a flash and responds quickly.  We are wanting to address this problem
in order to stave down the phone calls that we're having nightmares
about receiving from the people we support as they call and
compare PCPine to Vines Mail)

Thanks for any help!!

My provider uses PINE 3.96 for my shell account. I have been unable to
find out how to download an e-mail message from the INBOX to my own
hard disk although the E)xport feature is supposed to offer this
option. Any help?

Export will save the mail message into a file that your provider's
Unix box... After that happens, you need to bring up FTP on your
Mac or PC and log into that Unix box and ftp it down to your local
Mac or PC box...

Good luck,

    Yes, it is certainly possible, provided that your version of Pine
is recent enough.  (I do not remember exactly with which version the
feature came it, and you did not post from Pine, so I could not tell
which version you are using.)  The feature you want is the Lcc: header
field.  If you don't see it, press Control-R when the cursor is in the
header area.  Even with current Pine, I do not recall whether you
actually have to add it to your personal configuration, but current
Pine has just what you need in the Lcc: field.  Put the nickname of the
addressbook list name there.

Please Help-

I am a student at the University of New England working with the 
director of Computer Services to change the E-Mail system  a bit!

What we want to do is create one addressbook, that all e-mail users 
(students) can have access to but still add their own addresses to.  
However, the addresses change every day, and we need a script or 
something that will change the global addressbook, and then append it 
to everyone's addressbook, without deleting their own customized 
addresses.  We use Unix, and Pine 3.89.  Please send me any 
suggestions you may have. Thank You Very Much

Here's some features I'd like to see in next version of pine:

1. move the compile-time option ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM into a runtime
configuration option (which could be set in pine.conf.fixed, thus
still allowing sysadmins to enforce whatever policy they like).

2. add an option auto-delete-news which makes pine work more like a
traditional newsreader when reading news (instead of mail).

3. popup some dialog when there's no configured viewer for a
mime-attachment, and allow the user to type in the name of a program
to use. Optionally add this info to ~/.mailcap and ~/.mime-types.

Hi,

I have read the FAQ and the help file but to no avail.

My inbox is locked and I cannot find a lock file.  I have rebooted my
machine but the inbox is still locked.  I have checked the permissions on
the mail directory, and it is correct (1777).

Any suggestions as to why my INBOX is locked and read-only?

Thanks
Santosh Krishnan

I can send mail to the following address using PINE:

<firstname=initial.=lastname%PAO%DFCI@EYE.DFCI.HARVARD.EDU>

However, when I send to the same address using any Windows based email
program, I get an error.  I believe it doesn't like the "=".  

How can I send to this address successfully using my Windows app?  (ie. 
Does pine parse the address into something sendable, whereas my windows
apps don't?)

Thank You!!

Hi! Dear representatives:

	I currently study at the University of Central Oklahoma for my 
master degree. I got a lot of interest in e-mail. However, I have met 
sort of difficulties about print-out methods of the "pine" and "pico" 
systems. May I ask you how to print out the texts of my files in "pico" 
system, and how to print out the message I compose before sending it to 
somebody? Thanks for taking so much time to view my questions. I really 
need to figure these problems out as soon as possible. If you receive my 
message, would you please give my your reply? Thanks and appreciate for 
your thoughtfulness. Have a nice day!!!!

							Sincerely,
								
								I-Liang Bau

Is it possible to change automatically the 'Reply-to' field when
creating an email? I know that mailx in SOF can do it (mailx -r ....).

Thank you.

Hi.
I have been using pine from Uni for som time now and have just hooked up a
modem on my home PC. I was wondering if there is a way that I can foward
mail to my home address but also have a copy of it stay at my Uni address.
If anyone knows of a way to do this or of a web site I could visit to
obtain this information I would be eternaly greatful.

Can anyone tell me what the "PMDF" in "PMDF Pine" stands for?

Thanks....John

Mike,
The "mystery message" is a feature of many IMAP4 servers that use standard
Unix mailbox format.  In your case, I'm guessing its appearance is
actually a side-effect of upgrading an IMAP server from IMAP2bis to IMAP4
level.  But it's only visible in specific situations.  In particular, it
should not be visible to PC-Pine users, or in any other IMAP clients. 

Unlike the earlier IMAP2bis specification, IMAP4 supports the concept of
unique message IDs that persist across sessions.  These can be used for,
among other things, folder resynchronization in disconnected operation. 
Recent versions of POP have a similar concept (UIDL).  The IMAP4 UID info
has to persist across sessions, and part of it relates to an entire
mailbox, rather than an individual message.  Soooo, where to store it?  In
the case of the normal Unix mailbox format, that's a problem.  Answer: put
a "fake" message at the beginning of the mailbox, and put the necessary
info somewhere in that message. 

Here are the key points:

 o Some mailbox formats provide other places to put this info, but the
   normal Unix mailbox format doesn't provide many options; hence, the
   mystery msg at the beginning of the mailbox.

 o Mail clients accessing the mailstore via IMAP or POP will never see it,
   assuming the IMAP and POP servers share the same discipline.

 o Mail clients that directly access the mailstore (local disk or via NFS)
   *will* see it and display it, unless they have been taught to ignore
   it.

 o Deleting the message won't help... it will just come back again.

 o Pine 4.xx will not display it even when accessing the mail store
   locally, (and Pine 4 will be bundled with an IMAP4rev1 server rather
   than the IMAP2bis server that is part of the current Pine
   distributions.) 

If (and only if) you have mail clients directly accessing a Unix-style
mailstore that is also exported via IMAP or POP, then you have a dilemma,
at least until Pine 4.00 is available, since users will probably find the
mystery msg disconcerting if it is displayed.  In general, using the
latest IMAP4 server is recommended, but in these cases it may be better to
continue using an IMAP2bis server for a bit longer.  (The IMAP2bis server
that is part of the new Pine 3.96 distribution has all known security
holes plugged, as does the UW IMAP4rev1 server in our IMAP toolkit
distribution. )

Distribution of received mail into seperate folders dependent on
header-content is'nt Pine's task.
I'm using procmail, and it works fine for me (Un*x only).

I suspect you're already half way there if you have a "Reply-to:" header;
one isn't included by default in Pine so I presume you must have already
found the "customized-hdrs" variable in Pine's Setup Configuration screen
in order to add it?

All you need do is to change this slightly to include a default value
after the "Reply-to:" header you've set there.  From:

    customized-hdrs          = Reply-to:

to something like

    customized-hdrs          = Reply-to: Patrick Lenders <pat@une.edu.au>

Cheers,

This newsgroup is unmoderated.

In unmoderated newsgroups it is generally the reader's job to ensure 
(s)he doesn't read uninteresting messages, usually by putting unwanted 
posters and subjects in a killfile.

Given that it is unmoderated, comp.mail.pine is actually remarkably 
civilized. Which is a good thing since pine doesn't have a killfile.

On the other hand, if this was a really flame-infested newsgroup then 
maybe killfiles for pine would get a little higher priority..

Greetings,
Ørjan.

To answer your question - according to a post here some time ago, when 
2000 comes around, the last-time-prune-questioned value will just keep 
going up - ie 100.3 would be March 2000.

I figure that I should have either graduated or run out of money by then, 
so hopefully I won't be at University anymore!

Under Unix pine 3.95:

If you pipe/print a message using: "cat - > file.txt", it works fine.  But
if you use "cat - > file.txt &", you get a file with zero byte count.  Why
is this so? Is this a SunOS problem? Are there alternative ways to
accomplish this? 

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

Recently I compiled pine3.96 on AIX 4.14 operating system.  It seems to
run fine.  We are considering purchasing an new IBM with AIX 4.15 to use
as our e-mail server running pine 3.96.  Before this very expensive
purchase I wanted to ask you if you know if this works well, any expected
limitations, or bugs?  Also, where can I get info on running news with
this?

Thank your for your help.

Lynn Burdick

Hi,
  I am currently using this e-mail system.It is very easy and helpful.I
want to know how to forward the incomming mail to my account at work which
uses a private internet service provider.I went to the on-line pine help
and found that each message could be forwarded individually.But I need to
forward every mail that comes to my university account without forwarding 
individually.
  Thanks.

I've been using Pine for three or four years now, but have never
discovered an easy way to indent text.  I would like to indent
quotations in a similar manner to ^J.  Anybody have a way to do this
other than booting off to another editor or entering spaces by hand?

If there is no way of doing this, please add it to the 4.0 wish
list.  :-)

Thanks,

I am amazed that everybody forgot about the nifty feature in pine 3.92 or 
later.  It is called download command.  If you go into setup/config and 
see this option, you can set it to the name of a file transfering 
program.  So, if you wanted to be able to download files straight from 
pine without exiting and you have zmodem, define a "download command" of 
"sz -a."  No period.  Now when you press e to export a message, you will 
be able to press control-V to download straight to your PC.  The only 
draw-back is that the file gets a stupid temporary name.  If you are 
really good, you can also define an upload command too.  If you are going 
to try that, bee sure and read the help text on it because it isn't 
nearly as easy.

Dear Ms. Juanita Fischer,
        I have received a message on my mailing system (I usePower
Macintosh 8500/150) which requires UUDECODE software. Browsing through the
list I found your address.
        I would like to know where I can obtain this software. Can I
download ? If so then please let me know the site. I am using Eudora
J1.3.8.5 software for e-mail.
        Thanking you very much and hope to hear from you at your earliest.
        Cordially,
        Abhay

UUDECODE (or UUENCODE) is a program available for Power Macintosh.

It is on many Macintosh web sites, including www.shareware.com.

Check it out there...

Good luck,

Pine's built-in editor (pico) doesn't do that too well. You might consider

Pine insists on connecting to a working mailbox before sending mail, 
as an anti-forgery feature.

I guess it will check the inbox listed in inbox-path, so maybe you 
could try to make sure that it is not a remote one, and put your 
remote one(s) as an extra incoming-folder.

Greetings,

Pine (but not PC-Pine) attempts to use the "rsh" mechanism to connect to
your IMAP server in case your Systems Administrator has set up a
"pre-authenticated" version of the IMAP server software.

This is done very simply (setting up a symbolic link from one filename to
another), and then gives users access to the IMAP server without them
having to type in their username and password to Pine eash session.  This
is possible because the rsh mecnahmism allows the IMAP server to determine
the username that the person has already authenticated under.

So the ideal solution (from your, the user's, point of view) is to ask
your Systems Administrator to consider setting up the pre-authenticated
server.

If they don't want to then you _can_ disable the rsh attempt.

One way, which works on a per-host basis, is to add ":143" after the IMAP
server host name in your Pine Setup Configuration screen.  Thus

=09{imap.site.domain}INBOX

would be changed to

=09{imap.site.domain:143}INBOX

The presence of the ":143" means that Pine will not try the rsh mechanism,
but instead open an unauthenticated connection to the IMAP server straight
away and prompt you to enter your username and password.

Alternatively, you can set the "rsh-open-timeout" to 0 in your .pinerc
file, which disables rsh attempts for _all_ the IMAP servers you specify.
As this is something users are not normally expected to tamper with there
is no "pretty" interface in the Setup Configuration screen to do this; you
will need to edit your .pinerc file with your favourite text editor.

Cheers,

Pine cannot be used to automatically forward copies of incoming messages
to another e-mail address.  Pine, like all other mail reading programs, is
for presenting messages *after* they have been delivered into your mail
folder; it has nothing to do with the actual delivery process which writes
them into the folder.

Instead you need to persuade your computer's mail delivery software to
send a copy elsewhere.  For UNIX systems running the "sendmail" delivery
software this is done by setting up a file called ".forward" in your home
directory.

To *redirect* a copy elsewhere (without getting a copy yourself) you
simply put the e-mail address in to it:

	someone@somewhere.site.domain

If you want to keep a copy for yourself as well you put your username
preceded by a backslash in there too:

	\yourusername
	someone@somewhere.site.domain

Check the manual page for "sendmail" for more details and/or your local
support desk.

Cheers,

You need sendmail on your system and a file called .forward, containing only
the address you want the mail sent to, in your home directory.

Check the forwar man page for some background information.

No, export will save the file to your home directory (or other
preconfigured directory, I guess) on the box on which you're running PINE.
Then you can use xmodem or zmodem or whatever you prefer to download the
file from your shell account to your own computer.

The MH namespace (specified by #MH) is relative to the path specified
in your .mh_profile configuration file.  Thus, you probably want to
specify

	#MH/[]

If you have sub-folders, you will need to specify them as separate
collections (until Pine 4.00 comes out), e.g. 

	#MH/foo/[]

Good luck!

	[!]- Suggestion -[!]
I'd like to be able to save to 2+ Fcc: folders.

	[!]- Suggestion -[!]
It should be easier to "mount" other archived email directories.
(ex. A folder isn't in mail/ or incoming/, & instead in ~/bin/)

The system that I am using is being attacked by an e-mail bomber... if
you know of any filtering or cut-off programs that would stop this crap,
i would be forever in you debt, and I will send the title of the product
to my web owners.

Thank you

Has anyone out there attempted a port to DG/UX 4.11 on the Intel =
platform. The "d-g" port does not compile on this platform and I thought =
I would check before attempting the port myself.

Hello,
Is there a decent way of getting pine to show the full headers (if they exist 
and some clients can send them) in this MIME bodypart.

pine3.96 (and I assume earlier ones) can be persuaded to do this by piping the 
bodypart to cat. Is there a better way?

How about:

alias pine "autosig.pl; pine"

where autosig.pl is a Perl script that copies a file randomly from a 
number of candidate files to .sig4pine, and a setting in Pine to use
.sig4pine as the signature file?  This should work if you need to 
change the signature file once per Pine session.

Another way would be to use a Perl script as a sending-filter in Pine
and in this script, you append a file from a number of candidates at
the end of the email message.

I have not done either script, but I think they should work.

Just my 2c.

	While everything you said is correct, there are other options
these days.  While fearing to sound like a heretic, there are some very
good IMAP4 UAs on the market with the ability to define "rules" (much like
procmail) to operate on incoming mail.  (Yes, I know the mail has already
been "delivered".)  A particular UA which I'm familiar with, can be
instructed to (based on content) forward the email to a specified address,
reply with a canned message, copy the message to a local or host folder,
move the message to a local or host folder, or any combination of the
above.  (BTW, the same rules can be applied to outgoing mails too.)

	This is a good option for folks who don't know how to use
procmail, don't have access to procmail, etc.

	Of course, the downside to the UA approach is that the UA *must*
be running and processing the inbox.  So, it will *not* work for those who
simply wish to forward all of their emails to a second/alternate email
account.  Also, this approach may not be the best for those using dialup
links where the cost of connect time may be an issue.  The extra time the
UA needs to stay connected to perform the operations may be extensive if
you receive large amounts of emails.

	Just thought I'd throw in an alternative perspective.  Although,
for my money pine is still the best UA on the market.  I just can't use it
in all situations.  :-( :-(

Hi,

While I am logged on the POP server to check my mail, incoming mail does
not arrive into the INBOX folder even though I have this option
'mail-check-interval=20' in my .pinerc. I have to quit pine and rerun it
to check my mail again.

Anybody knows how to handle this?

Thank you.

Raoul

Is it possible to use sortmail to first first sort some mail to different mailboxes, and then send the rest to both the default folder and forward to another address?

For what purpose(s)?

If you are launching mail into a system that only guarantees 7-bit
integrity, it isn't a good idea to try to use straight 8-bit
characters. 

Look at the feature list of the version of PINE that you are using. 
Find the ones called enable-8bit-blah-blah.  If it hasn't got them, then
upgrade.  But if you're only talking to a 7-bit SMTP server, it still
won't be able to use 8-bit data, so PINE still may need to use QP
encoding to guarantee the integrity of your data.

Sure, we all know that... But, there's Microsoft and wysiwyg and Netcrap
Mail and whatever else, and people are using them like they're using their
textprocessors and then Germans tend to get control characters instead of
=E4=F6=FC, etc. ... and that sucks :-) Though I don't actively use ISO-8859=
-1, I
have it set to avoid seeing what you're seeing in the line above.

So, Heinz, edit your .pinerc in the following way:

# Typical alternatives include ISO-8859-x, (x is a number between 1 and 9).
character-set=3Diso-8859-1

That's all.

Cheers,
Robin

You don't seem to have considered answering my question.  If you re-read
the original posting, I think you will be able to reach two conclusions:

1. Heinz wanted to send 8-bit characters over the 'net

2. Heinz had already discovered the character-set=iso-8859-1
parameter, whose purpose is clearly documented in the .pinerc
comments, and had discovered that it didn't control what is sent
out over the 'net.  Which is of course true.

Yeah, yeah, now let's actually address the question, shall we?

What am I seeing in the line above???  Or rather, what do you imagine
I am seeing.  "control characters"?  _Which_ control characters, and 
why?

> So, Heinz, edit your .pinerc in the following way:

He said he had already done that, and it doesn't affect what is sent to
the 'net.  And he is right, it really doesn't affect what is sent to the
'net.  Not for usenet news, and not for mail. 

> That's all.

         Wirklich?

As I said, I believe that enable-8bit-nntp-posting and
enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation are what the questioner is looking for. 
But they are only available in recent versions of PINE, _and_ they still
won't be useful if PINE is working to a 7-bit protocol mail server, in
which case it will still have to use quoted-printable encoding.

And please note:

# character-set should reflect the capabilities of the display you have.

The display that _you_ have, OK?  Not the capabilities of the mail
transfer agent, not the capabilities of the display that your
addressee has, but the capabilities of the display that _you_ have.

This parameter controls the way that the PINE client presents mail onto
_your_ terminal display.  Not how it encodes it for sending it over the
'net.

To the pine mailing list:

1.  Would someone please send me instructions for joining this list, and
until then please cc: me in any replies or I won't see them 8-(

2.  My ISP doesn't know the answer to this and I don't find it in the pine
help and man systems:  How can I switch to the European character set
Latin-8 or ISO 8859-1 in my UNIX shell account or in pine (running version
3.95q).  I've been fudging Spanish using ascii for years but am now on a
project where I really need to write it correctly in the body of E-mail
messages (MIME attachments are no problem). 

So how do I switch to that character set, either on the fly or
permanently? 

3.  If someone can tell me the answer to that question, please also tell
me the pine keystrokes I would use to access the non-ascii characters -
for Spanish that would be the accented (acute) lowercase vowels, u with
dieresis (umlaut), n and N with tilde (~), and opening ? and !. 

Might as well send the whole set since I do messages occasionally in other
languages and we can also pass it along to the whole CAIS community.

Thanks for any help.

You forgot the ME TOO!!!, but the massive use of exclamation marks makes
good for that. Nice personal touch...

No need to stress your ignorance. One is quite aware of it... BTW, who
taught you to spell the word "mail bomb" correctly? Or did you copy it off
the latest PC-magazine?
  
  > if there is a way to bomb them back or prevent them from bombing me

The best thing to do in this case is to take your modem chord and a hook,
fix the latter firmly to your ceiling, attach the former to the latter and
hang yourself.

Parents? I thought things like you grew on trees.

*Very* nice piece of irony.  

  >premo 4

What's that? "Kick me" in Italian?

Get a life and read the Netiquette. You won't find it and probably wouldn't
understand it, anyway, cause there are too many words in it, but that's ok.
It would spoil your personal style of writing emails...

If you ever get a real mail-bombing (answer this post and you could get one
FREE, NOW!!!), consult with the people at n.a.n.a.

How do I set up pine to print using 'cat'?  I don't have lpr set up on my
system, and I usually just print plain text files using 'cat filename >
/dev/lp1'.  Is there any way I can get pine to do this?

(Using Linux Pine 3.95.)

Subject: Bug (ID 02290): Lost text


	Earlier today I was composing a lengthy text in the COMPOSE 
folder and was suddenly unable to give commands to the screen. I was left 
with the window of my text showing and the cursor blinking, but I could 
not move the cursor nor use any control command to save or postpone my 
message.  I assumed that my connection to the carrier at Mt. Holyoke had 
been disrupted, so I closed down the windows of my application (Kermit) 
and tried to re-establish the connection by redialing.  I was able to 
dial on my modem, but after the connection was made, my usual local prompt 
to the MHC communications computer (c mhc) would not go through (the 
message "Service in use" or something to that effect appeared each time I 
tried to log on.  I assumed that some problem or servicing was keeping 
the system down and shut my computer/modem off.

     As a result I have lost a text that took a great deal of time to 
compose.  Is there any possibility that the text could have been saved 
(in some default folder?) at the time of the interruption of my 
connection to the carrier?  If so, is there any way I could retrieve the 
text now?

Hi all!

I have the following curious situation:

I have two accounts, on different systems. I use pine on post.smu.edu. I 
have set up my configuration so that I can access my Inbox on 
blue.austinc.edu as an incoming folder. When I press TAB at the end of my 
SMU Inbox, Pine initiates a connection to blue.austinc.edu to get my mail 
from there. So far so good.

Here's where the funny part starts. Pine then asks me for my username and 
password. It does not matter if I have put USER:dgriswold in the 
configuration, following the syntax frequently provided on this 
newsgroup. But hey, I could live with that. Except: if there is indeed 
mail for me located on the server at blue.austinc.edu, then pine asks me 
for my username and password AGAIN!

Does anybody have any idea why this is happening? I imagine it may be a 
configuration "feature" either at smu.edu or at austinc.edu, but I would 
like to narrow the sphere before I start rattling cages. Of course, maybe 
I didn't config properly in the first place. But asked for that data twice?

I appreciate any help any of you gurus can give.

Thanks,

Dan Griswold

I sent an email from PINE today and forgot to put an 
address in the To: field. PINE didn't give me an
error message. Did the email get sent anywhere ??
Can you set PINE up so that it requires a To:
field entry ?

Thanks....

In the S(etup), C(onfig) screen, set the character-set to iso-8859-1.

On your unix account, type

	man ascii

and

	man latin1

If you want to take those home, try

	man xy > file (e.g. man ascii > ascii.table).
	
The exact procedures of actually mapping your keyboard cannot be discussed
in brief form. Your ISP should know how to do that, and you can also find
the Linux Keyboard-HOWTO on the internet. If you're working under X, you
should take a look at Xkeycaps, a program that lets you modify your
keymappings quite easily.

Enjoy. If you have further questions concerning 8bit-nntp-posting and
8bit-esmtp-negotiation, please turn to Alan J. Flavell
<flavell@mail.cern.ch>, because he's much smarter at at that than I am.

I am afraid you cannot do that without changing the source code and 
recompiling; I believe the X-Sender header is pine's modest 
contribution to prevent forging of email.

Why wouldn't it ? Pine can read (almost) any folder, so I guess this will 
work with sortmail. I've never heard of it, but it works with procmail 
just fine here.

I got a message about how to report a bug when I typed in pine at the
dollar sign.  I never realized that I had a bug but I guess that I do.  I
used to be able to save my messages in folders but then they got filled
and now I can't save or delete anything--I have 643 messages in Inbox.
Whenever I start my E-mail I get a message asking me if I want new Pine
information and whether or not I want to save my Mail in Feb-97, but I
can't save or delete anything and when I try I get some message with
7's,0's,X's and E's.  I would appriciate it if you can help me--thank you,
Erin Allard

You're right.  It is asked often, but we've all got to start
somewhere. 

The answer to this question is dependant upon which operating system
you are using.  Since most Pine users are on Unix boxes, I'll go
with that assumption.

Get procmail and learn how to use it by reading all the man pages.
Yes, it's a tedious process, and the program is not overly
user-friendly, but it is *very* powerful.  With it you can easily
sort out people on mailing lists that are not worth reading.  You
can send them directly to /dev/null (the UNIX trashcan).

I am also using Pine ver 3.96 with Windows 95. To download a message to the
harddisk I tell Pine which drive and subdirectory to export the message to.
It works without any problems. Maybe it has to do with your configuration
file? 
What I have not been able to find out is how to export several messages at
the same time. The export commands expects you to give your message a file
name.
BTW: Are you using Pine with Dialog Boxes? (Config menu).

I seem to recall someone once complaining about pine treating the 
entries in .mailcap as case sensitive. So it may be that you have 
rediscovered a bug in pine.

Pine or procmail? To set up pine, you'd need something like this in your
.pinerc:

# List of incoming msg folders besides INBOX, e.g. ={host2}inbox,
# {host3}inbox Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-host-name}folder-path
incoming-folders="Robin" 	~/Mail/IN.robin,
                 "Pine"         ~/Mail/IN.pine,
                 "Procmail"     ~/Mail/IN.procmail

This will get you a new "folder collection" with these files from your
Mail-dir. You'd have to create them first, though. At the same time, you
should cook up some script to store them later on, as they do not get pruned
by pine and can become quite large. (A dirty hack would be something like
	cat IN.pine >> ./OLD/IN.pine | rm IN.pine | touch IN.pine
No comments on this, it ugly and clumsy, but it'll work in the beginning.
                        
Setting up procmail is an entirely different matter, and I strongly suggest
getting some kind of FAQ before starting on it, even before reading the man
pages. A good starting point would be Nancy McGoughs "filtering FAQ", which
also has some references to further in-depth information.

There  exists  a mailinglist for questions relating to any program in the
procmail package:
<procmail@informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
	for submitting questions/answers.
<procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
	for subscription requests.
                                   
Enjoy.

No product, just a little bit of your time, and the problem will be taken care
of. What I do is trace the source of such a message, (usually just a simple
examination of message headers, occasionally some deeper investigation
afterwards), and forward it right back to them, with a Cc: to their
postmaster. In the forward message, I include a polite request for the sender
to stop sending me these messages, and for the postmaster to administer
his/her sight responsibly.

If that fails, I send the next one in a similar fashion, indicating that
subsequent messages will simply be sent to the site's provider without further
warning, (I use traceroute to find the site's provider). That hasn't yet failed.

As an alternative, (if the sender is really obnoxious to begin with), you could
simply bounce the messages right to their postmaster without any intervention
on your part. The more obnoxious the sender, the quicker it will get taken
care of...

If you want automatic processing of these, look into procmail. You'll have to
write a simple procmail script, (I'm not sure how to use procmail, but I know
it will be able to handle this), which will handle the messages in whatever
way you see fit.

Hope that helps...

	I'd like to learn how to edit enclosed messages when I reply to my
mail. I get to the stage where I'm ready to type my reply, with the
insertion point between the header and the enclosed message, which appears
with a column of  > signs in the left margin. Ideally (and I've seen this
done by plenty of folks out there) I would enclose selected lines and
insert my comments between those lines.

As an administrator, I have but one wish for pine:

Make it as memory efficient as elm.

It's just nuts to read the entire spool into memory. My system has a
half-a gig of ram in it, so it's not a catastrophe when someone opens a
mailbox with a 34meg file attachment on one of the messages. 

But it's certainly not pretty, and it's not appreciated when the system is
already very busy. Pine however is the shell-based mailer of choice. Hey -
*I* use it. But I know enough to keep my inbox as small as possible, my
customers don't give a damn about that (and of course, it's not their
responsibility to do so).

elm is just as responsive as pine, yet it's able to do what it does
without chewing up gobs of memory.

Why can't pine?

man procmail
man procmailrc
man procmailex
man procmailsc

should tell you what you need to know.

That said, here's a simple recipe for routing messages from a specfic
person (bagbiter@spamsite.com) to /dev/null.

#
# billd's procmail file
#

# much deleted, obviously.

:0
*From.bagbiter@spamsite.com
/dev/null



Needless to say, it's useful to do some sort of logging.  Also, procmail
recipes often take some tinkering before they're right.  Route copies of
stuff you want to trash to a folder at first instead, so that you don't
inadvertently trash mail you want to keep.

Well, there are two basic options:

	1: Stick with pine's built-in editor pico. Then you need ^K (strg+k)
	to cut the lines you don't want, and ^J to justify the paragraphs
	that have become to long to fit in one line.
	
	2: For advanced editing, you need to specify an external editor in
	pine's S(etup), C(onfig) screen. Talk to your sysadmin which ones
	you have. Personally, I favour joe, because it's small and simple,
	but there is also vim (vi improved [contradiction in terms]).
	Finally, there's emacs, the editor of Gods. As a matter of fact, it
	comes with its own mailer and it is loud as hell, but it does have
	supercite (if you've seen stuff like ""R.S.S" = Robin S. Socha
	wrote", that was probably done with emacs.

Now, since you don't seem to know too much about email, yet, why don't you
go ahead and grab some email-faq off the internet. Check

	www.metacrawler.com

Hello everybody,

Does anyone know how to set pine (3.96) so that I can view japanese
characters on a unix machine?
I have set the character-set to ISO-2022-JP in .pinerc, I am using kterm
and the LANG variable is set to 'japanese'. But still all the japanese
characters appear blank.

Thank for any help.

Assuming the original Compuserve user ID is "74051,3471", then the correct
way to address Internet e-mail is "74051.3471@compuserve.com".  (Note that
the comma in the user ID has to be converted to a dot.)
 
If that is what you did, and if Compuserve sent it back with a "user
unknown" error message, that means there is no user known as "74051,3471"
on Compuserve.  You need to get the correct Compuserve user ID by some
other means, then try again.
 
By the way, if you are sending your mail from AOL, then you really should
be asking AOL's tech support staff for assistance.  This is a mailing
list/newsgroup for support of the Pine mail program, not a general e-mail
support group.

I normally do not refer to FAQ's, but as you probably don't have any idea
where to start, I will this time.

The mail filtering FAQ can be obtained through:

First, bombing them back will not resolve the situation.  If anything, it
will only provoke them to mail bomb you again, whether they were kidding
or not.  Mailbombs are heavily frowned upon because they waste bandwidth
and, if applicable (which it is in most cases), disk space.

The best way, I feel, is to tell them to stop mail bombing you.  If they
still persist, contact their ISP with a copy of the mail bomb and all its 
message headers.  With proper evidence, the abuser's account will be shut
down in a hurry.  If the person bombing you is from AOL (like you), the
account to contact is "abuse@aol.com".  I picked AOL because I know they
have a specific account to deal with abuse.  Other places generally have
"root" and/or "postmaster".  If they're site is VMS, it's generally
"POSTMASTER" and/or "SYSTEM".  Whatever site, it's best to only contact
"postmaster".

It's not surprising that your parents are getting upset.  Most people do
when they receive mail bombs.  They contain merely garbage, take up disk
space, and waste bandwidth.  Don't repeat the same blunder the bomber has
done to you.  That can only make matters worse.  I hope things work out
for the best.  Regards....

Is it possible to set pine (unix version 3.96) up to auto reply to
messages with a set piece of text.  If this is possible could someone
kindly let me know how it may be done.

My parents used to have a Toshiba microwave oven. If that's what you're
trying to convert those files "onto", just turn the big knob on the right.

Otherwise, go to yahoo

Dear all,

last week I changed the IMAP server from IMAP2.2bis to IMAP4rev1 from UW. 
After that the performance was so bad (time to open a not too big IMAP
folder: some minutes, time to write the sent copy to an IMAP folder up to
15 minutes) that I had to switch back to IMAP2.2bis. 

These delays mainly occured with pine 3.91 clients. 
Is there an explanation for this behaviour? 
Does it depend from the client version?
Did anybody else experience this loss of performance when switching to
IMAP4?

TIA

Hello,

  Can someone please tell me the file I need to create so pine will
automatically enter my username and password when it connects to the mail
server.  I'm using PC-Pine 3.96.  I had it working with an older version
and now have forgotten how to do it.

Thanks in advance, Gar Wells

Yes, I've been wondering about that, too... Personally, I wish Reagan had
nuked Moscow, but that's my personal opinion. Then again, Reagan couldn't
act, either...

Seriously now: Dear Toader POP, this is the *wrong* place to discuss these
matters. You shouldn't even answer this mail. Have someone explain to you
how newsgroups work and check the alt. section. 

	alt.politics.usa.misc
	alt.religion.kibology
	
seem good starting points to me. There are also mailing lists related to
this field, so check a search engine (http://www.metacrawler.com) for those.

Two basic options:

	vacation 
will reply to any mail automatically

	procmail or some other filterin program
will let you set up specific conditions for filtering mail and attaching
texts to the reply.

Best thing to do imo would be to get Nancy McGough's filtering-faq

   	http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/
   		filtering-faq/faq.html
   	http://www.smartpages.com/faqs/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html
   	ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   	ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
               
a) This is a faq, b) there's the apropos command on your system.

Enjoy.

If you would have read some of the articles in this newsgroup you would 
have known, that Pine does not have a feature like that. You will have to 
use an external program like procmail to do that. Off course Pine can be 
used to view the contents of the mail split into subfolders by procmail 
or anything alike.

This would be a nice theory, but look at what the Help entry for
character-set says:

This clearly indicates that it affects the marking of outgoing mail.
It says nothing about the display of incoming mail on your display.
The situation for PC-Pine is more complicated, as the character-set
variable may affect translations:

Now, my particular problem is that I cannot get any of this to work
with OS/2 Pine (any version, including 3.95).  Even with character-set
set to ISO-8859-1, OS/2 Pine will not translate incoming e-mail from
ISO-8859-1 to CP850.  It seems to correctly translate outgoing e-mail
from CP850 to ISO-8859-1, however.

Does anyone understand what is going on, and how I can persuade OS/2
Pine to translate incoming e-mail correctly?

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to pine-info@u.washington.edu weekly to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

   The most
   
Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, Questions & Answers, and information on where to
   obtain the software, can be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer, ... -- whichever organization provided you with
   the email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number
   of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users at other
   organizations.
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
     * If you are posting a question to the Pine Discussion Forum but do
       not subscribe to it, request in your message that replies be sent
       directly to you, with a copy to the forum. (Conversely, if you are
       answering a question in the Pine Discussion Forum, be sure to
       include the inquirer's email address in your reply, since s/he may
       not be a subscriber and will otherwise not see your answer).

  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does my message index show From: instead of To:?
  
   Applies to Pine for Unix only
   
   A number of Pine 3.95 users have reported seeing their own name,
   rather than the name of the recipient, in folder index listings of
   messages they have sent. This occurs when Pine detects the specific
   hostname of the computer on which it is running in the From: header.
   To avoid this from happening, set use-only-domain-name in Pine's SETUP
   CONFIGURATION menu to Yes; this strips the name of the specific host
   from your From: address. Alternatively, specify your domain name in
   user-domain (be sure you enter it correctly, otherwise all your
   outgoing messages will have an invalid return address! Ask your local
   computing support people if in doubt). When setting either of these
   options, also read the help screen for
   quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file to see whether you should enable that
   feature too.
   
   Administrators of systems where Pine exhibits this behavior should
   also check the /etc/hosts file for invalid entries; as an example, it
   should read:

  123.456.78.90   hostname.domain    hostname

   not just
  123.456.78.90   hostname

   -- otherwise, users' setting of use-only-domain-name to Yes will not
   have the intended effect.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as fetchmail (which supercedes
   popclient) can be used to download email from a POP server to a local
   Unix account, where it can then be accessed with Pine. fetchmail can
   be obtained from:
   http://locke.ccil.org:80/~esr/esr-freeware.html#fetchmail
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

    There is more to displaying _any_ particular set of characters than
just setting something in Pine.  That is important, yes, but whatever
type of computer terminal you use which does the actual display has to
have the physical capability of showing the characters completely apart
from whatever settings are given to Pine.  I am not familiar with
'kterm' (I don't even know whether it is hardware or software), so I
cannot say specifically what your difficulty is.

    I am only remarking that several hardware and software settings may
have to come together at once for you to be able to see what you want. 
Sometimes you may be ahead to try to find someone locally who can help
you on the spot.  (I once tried to help someone 5000 km. away with a
complex problem, and it required many, many emails, whereas I suspect a
knowledgeable local person might have been able to resolve it in 15
minutes.)

When composing a message press ^R in the header section and you will get 
some more headers to edit, including BCC.

If you want to BCC your outgoing e-mail to someone by default then go to 
the Config section from Setup and fill in Bcc: bla@bla.com on the 
customized hdrs line.

I have no idea is this possible and how, but I was hoping someone of you
would know and tell me.

My signature isn't exactly what I'd like it to be. I would want to have
one that has the same three-line-signature (address, phone, email,
www-address) and then a one-liner quotation above it. The quotation would
be randomized from a file I would have. Is that possible in any way? or do
I have to randomize the whole signature? (I think I know that can be
done, but I don't know how.) I think it needs a program of some sort,
doesn't it? So, what I'm asking for is the program, and precise
instructions on how to use it. Preferably I would like the one that
randomizes only the one-liner.

So you did.  However, thanks to the magic of usenet your answer hadn't
reached here at the time I suggested to look for the
enable-8bit-blah-blah options that you had already pointed out.

That's true.  (Not that this is the only time that a deceased equine
has ever been flagellated on usenet.)

I'm afraid I did get rather carried away when I saw the questioner being
advised to use the very option (Character-set) that he had already
pointed out didn't do what he wanted.  I apologise for the ferocity of
my reaction.

Yes, this qualifies as on the fly.  Unfortunately the distributed
version of PC-Pine doesn't have this ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM feature.
Does anyone know where I can find a version of PC-Pine for Windows
95 that was compiled with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM?

Thanks much,

    It all depends.  I couldn't tell from the headers on your message
for sure what kind of system you are using.  However, probably the
majority of Pine installations are on some kind of Un*x system, and on
those systems, probably the most common cause of getting an INBOX in
read-only is starting a second Pine session, usually without realizing
it, and thinking that that second session is "Pine," whereas a prior
Pine session is running in the background with a lock on the INBOX. 

    Resolving such a situation is usually simple but *does* require
rudimentary Un*x knowledge, and I'm not in a position to provide a Un*x
tutorial this afternoon.  Try simply quitting from Pine, and then
completely logging off from your server.  Wait a minute or two and log
back on to see if the problem is cleared.  (If you know some Un*x, you
don't have to go through these gyrations.)

I have a question.  When you send an e-mail, is there a special function
that allows you to see if the party who you sent the mail to has read the

Every morning when I start Pine and go through the evenings mail I have
a repeating frustration reading mail sent to various groups with the address
inconsistantly on either the To: or the Cc: lines.

I continually do the following to read these groups.
; T T somegroup
; T C somegroup
Of course this way the ordering of messages is wrong also. 
The existing alternative, ": T A somegroup", is slower and often picks up
lots of other junk.

I have made a patch that will allow one to search recipients in both the
To: and the Cc: lines at one time, thus keeping the order correct.

This is a really cool patch for those who do this all the time.
I would hope something similar makes it into the next release.    

Now instead of:
; T T mailer-daemon A D ; A ; T C mailer-daemon A D
You can just:
: T R mailer-daemon A D

I hope this patch is well recieved by the "Pine Team".
It was made against my pine3.95.patch-1 source tree, and should work with   
the recent pine3.96 as well.

Enjoy!

Randall

one way is to use a "registered mail" service of mail forwarding service.
Mail forwarding service are like pobox.com, post1.com etc...

Hi gurus,

I have a file containing 3636 addresses and want to send a mail to
all the people of this list. I create, using perl, an .addressbook
but, even I split them in 2 .addressbooks, Pine complains about
a too long file. Is something to do (of course not by hand) ??

TIA

JEAN

The latest WinZip can handle UUENCODE and UUDECODE (as well as lots
of other Unix-type archive formats). It's available at: 

  http://www.winzip.com

Good luck,
Nancy

Hello.  A while ago I hit something somewhere.  Since then, my problems
are:
1.  I always have to answer- which alternate editor?/usr/local/bin/pico
    which I do not know how to answer so I have to cancel

2. Then I always get a message that flashes"no room for file: no such file
	directory "

3.  In addition, I must always type "unlimit filesize" before calling up
pine even though i have very limited mail and folder usage.  I have
cleared it all out, but still type 'unlimit etc.

I know I did something, I just do not know how to undo what I did.  Thanks
for any help.  If I try and contact my local man, my mail gets bounced
back.

    Sorry, but your questions are almost unanswerable due to lack of
data.  There are many, many, many different kinds of attachments, which
may require many, many different kinds of viewers.  You did not tell us
what kind of attachment you are talking about, so it is unlikely that
anyone will be able to answer your first question in any blanket way.

    As for the second, the answer is, maybe, depending.  You posted
using TIN, so I am _guessing_ that you are talking about Pine running
on a Un*x system.  For some kinds of attachments, if you have a program
to read/view them, you can put an entry in the .mailcap file so Pine
will know what program to call so that you can see them.  There are as
many answers as there are kinds of attachments.  Also, in any case,
whatever the attachment is, your terminal (or desktop computer used as
a terminal) has to be physically capable of displaying the type of
attachment.  For example, if the attachment is a graphic file and you
are using a VT100 terminal or VT100 emulation, you cannot readily view
it.  It all depends.......

Talk to your sysadmin. In short:

ad 1. You have to set up your config in order to invoke the alternate editor
implicitly.

ad 2. Either you've exceeded your quota or you're trying to write into a
"broken" directory. Try invoking ed as your alternate editor and try to
change your temp directory to ~/tmp

ad 3. Seems like a quota problem, too.

2. and 3. are local problems for which you consult your sysadmin.

Cheers,
Robin

It's definitely the common problem.
2/3 of the planet Earth population do not use the Latin alphabet.
I have taken the Russian patches and have applied them to 
the pine-3.95. That enables a new option 
        dont-encode-8bit-text-and-subject,
which should be turned on in the configuration file.


Look at:
ftp://mail.sagantec.co.il/pub/russian/pine-with-koi8.txt
Or get the patched sources
ftp://mail.sagantec.co.il/pub/russian/pine3.95.with-8-th-bit.tar.gz
or just pick the compiled source for some platforms from
ftp://mail.sagantec.co.il/pub/russian/

Hi Michael,
	I found some good uuencode/uudecode utilities that run under DOS 
at the following website:

		http://www.acs.oakland.edu/oak/

I'm sure there will be Windoze versions too, plus a lot of other good 
stuff.  Check it out.

Hello all,
I was sent an attachment and I saved it on my unix account.  How do I view
it?  Was there a way to view it in pine?
Thank you

That's what it says (in .pinerc), and I'd say it's true.

Now, here I certainly got carried away [embarrassed shuffling] and
you rightly call me to account for it.

Actually [trying desperately to redeem himself] I think both statements
are true.  The character-set configuration is in effect a declaration of
the character-code that's used in your local environment, and this is
effective both for display of incoming messages and for creation of
outgoing messages.

PINE (the unix version, the one I'm familiar with) makes no attempt
to convert or adapt between different codes: if the incoming message
mis-matches the local setting then PINE will present an alert, but it
won't do anything to resolve the situation.  It's up to the reader to
select iso-2022-jp or koi8-r or whatever in their terminal environment 
if they want to see the message correctly.

This is indeed a useful feature.  Often (when reading mail composed with
some client other than PINE) I find myself being presented an alert that
the incoming message is in iso-irv-111 , iso-2022-kr or whatever, making
me nervous of what I'm about to see, when in fact the mail contains
nothing more than plain ascii.  However, this is an aside from the main
discussion... 

> This clearly indicates that it affects the marking of outgoing mail.

You are right...

> It says nothing about the display of incoming mail on your display.

It may not say it, but if you configure a character-set that does not
agree with what your terminal emulation is actually doing, then the 
incoming mail won't (in general) display correctly.

(and then you ask about OS/2 PINE)

This is an area that I'm unfamiliar with, so I'll resist the temptation
to pontificate. 

all the best!

Pl. tell why my Word program cannot open a Word Document which I have
received from a friend who sent it as an attachment using his shell
account.

His email to me which had the document as an attachment, I saved to my
home directory on the server and then transferred to my computer using
Kermit and also tried it with the sz -be filename zmodem protocol.

When I try to open the file my Word program says " Cannot open
Document".

Where am I going wrong?

Pl. help me.

Greetings
  I am wondering if there is a way to have Pine run my
outgoing filters automatically, without presenting me
with an option to run them and/or choose which ones to run
each time. It is very distracting, since I only have one
filter that I want to run all the time and I don't
need all the added hassle.

Thank you in advance

That depends... If metamail is installed on your system, you can specify
certain applications to be launched by pine with the view command. Here's an
example: For text/html attachments, you can set up lynx (a text-browser)
like this in your mailcap:

	test=test -z "$DISPLAY" -a -z "$LYNX_VERSION";
	text/html; lynx  -force_html %s; needsterminal;

This will launch lynx inside pine when you V(iew) that attachment.

So, check which applications you have that can display attachments and set
up your mailcap accordingly.

Cheers,
Robin

Sure there is. But first, here's some antagonistic criticism...

1.      See if there is a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for a group.
        Veteran members get annoyed when they see the same questions every
        few weeks, or at the start of each semester.

	From the PINE-faq: 
	
	Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
	other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent."
	For details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
	Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough).
	
	http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
	faq.html

2. From the netiquette: 

	When you join a list, monitor the messages for a few days to get a
	feel for what common questions are asked, and what topics are deemed
	off-limits. This is commonly referred to as lurking. When you feel
	comfortable with the group, then start posting.
                                               
3. A personal remark:

	Neither bouncing nor rejecting is wanted behaviour on the Net.
	Normally, there is a certain reason for someone getting. Why don't
	you talk to the sender and tell him to stop his postings? If that
	doesn't help, check the net-abuse faq.

Cheers,
Robin

Quite a few options here... Since word is a *very* advanced program, well
renowned for its user-friendliness and downward-combatibility, you may need
to upgrade to an even more sophisticated version of word. Check with your
friend which version he's using. Did I say "use"? *argl*

Other options include not using ftp,  not setting ftp to binary mode,
transmission errors and use of Microsoftware. Check with your help-desk.

Cheers,
Robin

today, out of the clear blue, I got this error message from pine:

--
Problem detected: "Out of free storage".
Pine Exiting.
--

doing a df reveals that there is indeed more than enough disk space.

And the error message only comes up when I am running fetchmail in
daemon mode! (with the -d switch).

what could cause this?? has anyone seen this happen before?

I have two (at least) problems.  Sometimes when I begin pine and lynx my

Second,  I keep getting a "bad data packet" message when I try to download

Several times, but only with the DOS version of Pine (it comes up after
having it run for a while, I think there is a memory leakage somewhere, or
something like that). I've never gotten that error message with any other
version I used (Win3, WinNT, Linux, Sun).

Hi

What I've been missing in Pine 3 all since I started using it is a very
minor detail:

In the address book, when you create a list, why aren't the "members"
of the list ordinary address book entries?

What if I have three lists in which I have my friend 'alpha' in (who
I also frequently send personal mails) and one day he changes his
address. As I see it, it would be a very easy fix to let a list merely
refer to a real 'personal' entry in the address book and then I could
change Alpha's address in one place and see it changed in all lists.

*AND* I could enter real name, comment, fcc etc for single persons in
a list...

This way, the lists would be more like 'groups' and you could put any
person into any group (yes, very much like the user system in unix)...

Subject: How to view html attachments from PC-Pine?
X-To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,

I have spent the last couple of hours digging through the Pine discussion
list archive, Dejanews, Netscape technical support, and Microsoft technical
support web pages. I have diddled mailcap and shortcut files until I am
blue in the face. I am finally reduced to a humble plea...

What is the magic invocation in the PC-Pine mailcap file to view an html
attachment in Internet Explorer? (3.01)

  text/html;c:\mumble\iexplore.exe %s

and

  text/html;c:\mumble\iexplore.exe file://%s

fail because Explorer automatically prepends http: to the argument.

  text/html;c:\mumble\iexplore.exe -f %s

and

  text/html;c:\mumble\iexplore.exe -f file://%s

fail because IE downloads the file then immediately exits, instead of
showing it.

Any usage of double quotes I can think of also fails.

I suppose I could invoke Netscape instead, but, presumably, there is no
parallel to the "-remote" option on Unix Netscape, so it would start
another copy, right? If I am wrong--that is, if there _is_ a way to pass a
command to Win95 Netscape to go to a new url, please let me know. That
would be even better than invoking IE.

Any clues to share?

Thanks,

    Pine cannot do it.  What you want done is part of the mail delivery
process, and Pine comes into play only after the fact in the mail
reading process.  However, for Un*x systems, there are programs
available which hook into the mail delivery process to do all sorts of
amazing things (if you know how to use them).  Two of the most common
are procmail and filter.  See if they are on your system.  procmail is
incredibly powerful, but it isn't the easiest program to use for its
super-duper features beyond basic mail filtering.  (For more
information, if you have a WWW browser, browse my home page and follow
the links.)

Ummm.... I don't understand your question, as I think Pine already does
exactly what you are asking.  It is quite legitimate to put the nickname
of another address book entry (individual entry, or even that of another
list) in as a member of a list.

Indeed, here's an extract from the Address Book's built-in help explicitly
stating this.  In particular note the last sentence.

	Pine entries can be simple cases of aliases (a single nickname is
	linked to a single email address) or distribution lists (a single
	nickname pointing at more than one email address).  Each
	distribution list has a nickname, a full name and a list of
	addresses. The addresses may be actual addresses or they may be
	other nicknames in your address book. They may even refer to other
	distribution lists.

Isn't this what you're after?

Cheers,

We encountered a small problem after installing UW's IMAP4rev1 server that
caused significant delays while opening folders with IMAP clients other
than pine.  In env_init() (within the file env_unix.c) calls are made to
getpwnam() to get the home directories for the accounts ftp, imappublic,
and imapshared.  We don't have those accounts on our system, but because
our /etc/passwd file is fairly large, it takes a while to search it only
to return nil.  I commented out the following code...

/*
   if (!ftpHome && (pw = getpwnam ("ftp")))
      ftpHome = cpystr (pw->pw_dir);
   if (!publicHome && (pw = getpwnam ("imappublic")))
      publicHome = cpystr (pw->pw_dir);
   if (!sharedHome && (pw = getpwnam ("imapshared")))
      sharedHome = cpystr (pw->pw_dir);
*/

...and things seem to be working ok.  Note that doing so might cause problems
elsewhere. (I haven't taken the time to really look into into it.)  A better
solution would probably be to create those accounts and make sure that they
are somewhere at the top of /etc/passwd.

You can't get it to automatically enter the password (unless you patch the
source code, that is), but you can get it to automatically enter the
username by adding

	/username=yourname

to the INBOX specification (inside the braces).

I'm having trouble deleting news messages ... here's the story:

I'm running Pine 3.96 under Linux.

To read news, I run Pine with the command:

   pine -c 2 -f comp.theory -i

(the "-c 2" gets me to my news folder-collection,
 and the "-f comp.theory" gets me to the first newsgroup,
 which in my case is comp.theory)

As I read the messages, I delete them with the "D" key.
I do this for all the news groups, and then exit from Pine.

At that stage, my ".newsrc" is updated to reflect these deletions
for all newgroups, EXCEPT the first one, comp.theory, and so
when I go to read news the next time, all the previously-read messages
are still there.  This lack of deletion applies only to the FIRST
of the newsgroups which I read.

"They stab it with their steely knives / But they just can't kill the beast!"

Any ideas, anyone?  I'm kinda new to Pine, so please pardon my newbie woes.

Thanks! -- Joseph

Yes, it is.

I'm very sorry and I feel ashamed for contributing to the constant stream of
RTFM related questions and requests. I will now starve myself a few days as
punishment for my stupidity =)

Forgive my ignorance and please continue.

On Pungenday, the 5th day of Discord in the YOLD 3163, AGKB Celebrated
Mojoday by writing:

  >I can't figure out how to check my e-mail from home or other off campus
  >sites. Can you help?
  
Three basic options:

1. Post your password and username to the list and we'll print out your
mails and send them to you.

2. Call the aol hotline and tell them your problem. They won't understand
you, but they'll be friendly and comforting.

3. RTFM, UTSL, and post to the right group
(alt.online-service.america-online). Your question isn't pine-related, in
fact doesn't have to do much with email at all. Do you have to undergo a
lobotomy these days to get an aol-account?

    Gentlemen, I answered the original question with suggestions for
Pine settings.  The questioner emailed me back that they worked just
fine and everything was OK.  You're flogging a dead horse.

You do have to get back to your unix prompt to run the talk program. But
you do not necessarily need to quit pine. You could simply suspend pine.
You would do this by means of the ctrl-Z key sequence. When you do this,
pine is suspended, and you are returned to the unix prompt. You then could
run the talk command. When you are done with talk, entering fg will return
you to pine, indeed, to the very place in pine you had left.

Is there a way to use pine, from the command line, to send a message

Hello:

To answer you best, we'll need a little more information about your
school's information systems.  Specifically:  

	a)  Do they allow internet mail?  (most likely)
	b)  What kind of mail servers are they running?  (UNIX, NT, other)
	c)  Are they accessible over the Internet?
	d)  If so, by what protocol?  (POP3 most likely or IMAP)
	e)  If the host is UNIX based, can you telnet to it, or, dial up
	    to it?
	f)  If its UNIX based, do they have a mail reader, like Pine?  (I
 	    assume they do, since you're making a request to this list)
	g)  If not, do you have some POP3 client (like Eudora) that can
            access it?

If you can answer these questions, you'll probably find your answer in the
course of finding out this information.  Regardless, you probably can't
access or use any method to retrieve your school mail on AOL.  You'll need
to use an ISP for internet access to your mail (above), or have
communications software on your PC (like Windows Terminal or
HyperTerminal) to dial up to a regualr node in your school's system (if
they allow this).

Start with the Information Systems or Technology department in your
school.  If you're not sure who or where to ask, go to any computer lab
and start asking questions.  Hopefully, they'll steer you in the right
direction, or answer you.

Good luck!!!

How do I get the select command to work in pine.  I can not figure it out.
It keeps telling me that the command is not supported.

This will only work if you have pine configured to honor the ctrl-z
sequence and suspend.  Check your .pinerc file...

We are trying to get Pine 3.96 or 3.95 working on AIX 4.2. I've loaded
the ptf U443976 that was suppose to fix the Pine/sendmail issue (locks
up when you try to send thru Pine). Now when I compose a message it
looks like Pine sends it but the it's never received. I'm not getting
any error messages back either. Anybody ever run across this before? Any
help/ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

   I just installed pine-3.96 .

   The Ctrl-Space stopped working. Instead it acts up -- jumps to the end
of the file instead to the next word.

   How can I fix this bug ? Or has it been fixed yet ?


        Thanx,

              Jan

First, enter "s" then "c" and find "enable-agrigate-command-set" and set 
it by pressing "x."

Is there any plan to implement message sorting in future releases of pine?
It would be really helpful if messages could be sorted as they come in
(similar to Eudora's filtering features) to different mailboxes.

Any information available would be great, thanks :)

Subject: (Q) Parse PGP attachments
X-To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've got a simple problem that most likely has a simple solution, but I
don't currently have the cycles to look into it - I'm hoping someone here
has already done the homework.

I'm currently able to read PGP messages when the PGP text is in the message.
However, PGP attachments don't get parsed.  My /etc/mailcap doesn't have
the correct (any?) setting for application/pgp.  Plugging in a correct value
for application/pgp should allow me to pipe the attachment through PGP, correct?

If anyone has a quick answer, I'd sure appreciate it!

I need some help regarding Pine. What if I want to change the server of 
my newsgroup, how would I do this? Ok, I did change my server at the 
SETUP and I chose CONFIG, then I changed the nntp-server to another 
server, but when I opened my newsgroup it always had an error. Why is 
that? Please help me about this. And one more question, how can I access 
news, what is the address of news? (e.g. gopher, http, ftp etc)

You have to go to setup and check "enable-aggregate-command-set" then try
the semicolon to select.

You could do this with "mapping tables":
 <http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/low-level.html#char-set>

The package  pinetab2.zip
  <http://www.coast.net/SimTel/msdos/network.html>
  <http://www.simtel.net/simtel.net/msdos/mailnews.html>
includes many such mapping tables although none for cp850.
>From what you write, it might be a good idea to include also tables
"iso-8859-1 -> cp850" and "iso-8859-1 <- cp850".
According to the Pine manual, that would be unnecessary because they
claim that Pine for MS-DOS and OS/2 will do such a translation
without special tables.

Your looking for something that handles signatures in the same way
that tin does with .sigfixed file and .Sig directory.  I would be
interested in this myself.  The only way I could see getting it to
work would be using a filter to append the file from the .Sig
directory after the signature...

Alas, it looked like more hassle than it was worth...  Anyone else?

You can ask your local sysadmin (if you're on a Unix system) to add your
aliases to the aliases file - in Sendmail something like 

<alias>: include:/home/luser/alias.list

You would then send mail to <alias>@<localhost> and it would send the
e-mail to every person on your list. The file with the list in it has to
be world-readable and in a world-executable directory but you can change
this file as needs be. Hope this solves your problem.

Hi all,

We are working in an experience of Internationalization and Localization
of Pine. It is not an easy job, because Pine was written with english
in mind. However, the experiment is going to succeed, so we would like 
to make it available for everybody and keep it in synch with pine development
(or give the code to the University of Washington to incorporate it
to the mainstream).  From the legal notices I read:

      Although the above trademark and copyright restrictions do not
      convey the right to redistribute derivative works, the University of
      Washington encourages unrestricted distribution of patch files which
      can be applied to the University of Washington Pine distribution.

This seems to mean that the distribution of modified sources or binaries
is forbidden. Is it true?

I have recently recieved an attachment to an e-mail of the type
"ms-tnef."  I am unable to produce any recognizable text or images from
this file. I noticed you sent in a question regarding a similar
occurance last November. Have you figured out what to do with these
ms-tnef files? I would appreciate any info you have obtained on how to
view them.

Thanks,
Brian Brocker

Don't bother it's MS-****, the data in there is normally things like
font changes, bold, italic and similar stuff. Just tell whomever sent
it that if they send a message like it to a mailing list they're likely
to feel like they've been mailbombed!

That file was produced with Microsoft's latest OS, TN 5.0. You need a copy
of that and the service--pack of 4th March, patchlevel 1.4.97.

Best thing to do is to write a message to Microsoft and tell them that you
need those files urgently. They'll certainly be more than helpful.

Enjoy,
Robin

I'm not so good at pine, but wouldn't it be possible to create a program and

Oh, programming is allways a lot more fun when it's something that is not
too usefull...

UP is considered a function key. However, you can use ^P.

But why don't you use

pine -Il,SPACE,CR

instead?

(expanded-view-of-folders must not be set, but you don't seem to be 
using it)

I am using Pine 3.95q on Unix system (Sun Solaris 2.5.1).

I have found that very occasionally when I or another user sends a
message, it just disappears. Sendmail normally records all mail in our
syslog file, but in these cases there is no entry at all. 

I suspect that it may have something to do with my sendmail-path variable. 
This is set to /usr/local/bin/sendit.sh in the pine.conf file. sendit.sh
is a script supplied with Pine. I use it rather than calling sendmail
directly because I found that this was causing lengthly delays when
sending messages. 

I would stress that 99% of our mail goes through with no problem, so this
problem is very intermittent.

Has anyone else encountered this problem? And does anyone know a
solution?

By the way, I am running sendmail 8.7.6.


Many thanks,

  Tim

I found it in the tech-notes file, which is probably the most complete 
documentation about pine.


initial-keystroke-list
       This is a comma-separated list of keystrokes which Pine
       executes on startup. Items in the list are usually just
       characters, but there are some special values. SPACE, TAB, and
       CR mean a space character, tab character, and a carriage
       return, respectively. F1 through F12 stand for the twelve
       function keys. UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT stand for the arrow
       keys. Control characters are represented with ^<char>. A
       restriction is that you can't mix function keys and character
       keys in this list even though you can, in some cases, mix them
       when running Pine. A user can always use only character keys in
       the startup list even if he or she is using function keys
       normally, or vice versa.


I guess it has something to do with these keystrokes being sent as 
combinations of others (usually ESC+something) and so they are handled 
another way.  It doesn't sound like a very sensible restriction, 
anyhow.

OK, I had another idea in mind but erased it when I thought of the 
above. What about:

pine -l -Il,w,m,y,.,f,i,r,s,t,.,n,e,w,s,g,r,o,u,p,CR

I would assume the number of rows would change a bit more often than 
the first newsgroup.

I was just writing to suggest/ask if, when I send out a msg to my list, 
can I do anything about the display of the address so it will only display
the addresses of the recipients and their full names will not be displayed
therefore making it quicker for the recipients to get to the msg instead
of scrolling down a couple of pages of addresses?

    I can't think of any way to do it _automatically_.  However, you
can certainly change it manually for every message if you want. 
Assuming you have defined Reply-To: in your personal configuration,
just edit it the way you would any other header field.  (Depending on 
how you have things set up, you might need to press Control-R to bring
up Rich Headers when editing the header fields.)  When you update your
configuration, you can put in a default value for the field or just
leave it blank.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

    Environment: Pine 3.96 under SunOS 4.1.4, dialin to shell account
(CShell) from DOS via ProComm Plus v2/DOS with VT100 emulation.

    I usually start Pine in one of several ways with an initial
keystroke list.  I am getting the same (anomalous) results whether I
enter the command from the shell prompt or whether I use a PCPlus
programmable keystroke string.  I have two folder collections, the
"lower" (on the screen) of which is the news collection.  I am trying
to come up with an initial keystroke string which will locate the
cursor/highlight on the first newsgroup in the collection.  One way
would be to display the folder collections, SPACE to go to the last
line of the second collection, and then cursor up.  However, I have run
into a problem.

    pine -l -Il,SPACE

will start Pine and locate the cursor/highlight on the last line of the
second (news) folder collection.  However,

    pine -l -Il,SPACE,UP,UP,UP

draws this error messsage:

[Mixed characters and function keys in "initial-keystroke-list", skipping!]

Unless I have overlooked something in the online documentation, this
second string ought to work, but it doesn't.  A query to my ISP's help
desk has gone unanswered.  Anybody with a similar experience or
suggestions?

Thanks very much.

    ^P (actual caret-P) does work.  Thanks for the tip.  I was going by
the online documentation for initial keystrokes, and it lists strokes
that would seem to work (unless I completely misunderstood) but
apparently don't, inasmuch as I do not recall anything in the help file
about mixing character and function keys and that UP is a function key. 
Nor does that particular help screen, as I recall, refer to using
control-keys in the initial keystroke list.  Perhaps the Pine folks
could clarify the documentation here a bit.

    If you will notice, I *am* using expanded view, and I most
certainly want to continue doing so for my personal operating style. 
Therefore, pine -Il,SPACE,CR produces unacceptable (to me) results.

Thanks again.

Sure, it's simple. Follow these easy instructions:

1. Download the source code (it's freely available). Make changes in it so
that it e-mails all the passwords to mustang21@worldnet.att.net. You may
need to know C++ programming to do this but don't let that discourage you.
You should be able to master C++ in a couple of evenings.

2. Break into the server you want to steal passwords from and install your
new pine. You're on your own here. Fast computers, brilliant minds and
delusions of grandeur are useful in this situation. Failing that, maybe
you could just send an e-mail to the administrator of that server asking
"anyone know how to hack this server?" 

3. Wait. And while you're waiting, maybe you could consider growing up.

I have downloaded and Mac Telnet program from the internet, NCSA Telnet 2.7b4
and it asks me to assign it a window but I'm not sure what it wants.  It
 errors out by saying the domain name is invalid.  Can you help me?

Thanks,

Not with the usual mail processors.  If your message is not returned
to you for faulty address for example, you can be ceertain it got
there.  Have a little faith in the electrons doing their daiily stint
between sites no matter across town or to Tierra Del Fuego.

Of course in this day and age, and with the blizzard of messages on
all nets, it may be impossible for your recipient to extend courtesy
by replying.  Then again he/she doesn't give a duck about replying.

So make your choice, or invent other reasons for lack of courtesy.

How do you attach a file that is on a floppy disk?  When I specify
"A:syllabus" for the file to be attached, Pine considered A: as part of
the filename of a file in my home directory and failed to find it.

We would be very interested to see how you have done the
Internationalization.  We have this on our list of projects to do, but
your contributions might make the job much easier (and get it done
quicker)...

Yes.  We encourage you to distribute a set of patches, but please do
not distribute a complete set of modified sources without prior
approval.  We may grant permission on a case by case basis (I don't
recall any request that has been denied).  Contact
pine@cac.washington.edu for further information.  This is in part to
assure the quality of products derived from Pine and partly to satisfy
the legal requirements that we maintain control over changes to
protect the Pine trademark.

I would prefer to use PINE 3.96 to VAX-VMS mail.
The VAX is running a POP server so I set up PINE (on DEC/OSF 1 v2.0 and
SGI IRIX 6.2) to use POP to get my mail from the VAX 
(inbox-path = {xray/pop3}INBOX).
When PINE starts everything works fine - it opens my inbox etc. But new
incoming messages don't seem to be detected (although I use
mail-check-interval = 60) - I need to quit and restart PINE to see if
there
are any new messages.

Does anyone have a clue?

Sure. The domain name is invalid. Assign it a window with the correct

Deleting should do the trick. You could of course try to set up pine
differently, so that you can X(punge) those messages directly. Be careful,
though, they will be lost forever.

I you cannot delete those messages at all, you should talk to your
sys-admin.

Cheers,
Robin

Good idea not to tell us what OS you're using, that *really* makes your
question a lot easier to answer.

Assuming you're using some flavour of u*ix, there is no "drive a:" or
similar nonsense. Try /dev/hd0 or copy the file to your home--dir first. If
for some reason you don't know how to do that, check if you have the mtools
installed on your system and try "mcopy a:*.* .".

Enjoy,
Robin

[Yet again...]

1.  Start composing a message.

2.  With the cursor on any of its header lines, type ^R (Rich Header
    command).

3.  Admire newly revealed additional headers.

4.  Put cursor on "Bcc:" header.

5.  Type ^G (Get Help) and read built-in help.

Why not writing within a file (with a text processor or not) and
attaching this file to the mail you send ?

Hi David,

The person working on it is not here now, but I guess we can write
a report for you in the first days of April. We would like better to
give our results to the University of Washington and maintain only the
localization.  As an advance, I can say that:

- We are working in version 3.95 and only on Linux
  (we tried to use MS/DOS and Windows, but we never succeded with
   the compilation).

- However we have translated the help for 3.91 into spanish, but
  needs revision.

- Internationalization of short messages and menus is almost done trough
  GNU gettext. Localization to Spanish too.

- Internationalization of the help should be done with messages
  in a file, not in the code, perhaps thru the same mechanism
  used in MS/DOS. We think this is not inefficient in modern unixes.

- Menu routines had to be changed: they were too english oriented.

- Other internationalization issues will be done with standard 
  POSIX locale libraries (mainly the presentation of dates).

- We use GNU libc features of printf, allowing to reorder the printout
  of arguments.

- The use of international dictionaries for spell checking is
  being integrated (there exist an ispell dictionary for spanish).

- We have not handled the problem of the handling of multiple
  charsets nor Unicode, but we would like.

- We have not made work on pico nor pilot yet.

Regards,


Joaquin

Again I call upon this group for help.  My computer was turned off while
in the middle of a PINE session.  The folder that was open at the time was
called "peace."  That folder is now locked, and it says that it is empty.
Instead, next to the folder name it now says:

peace.lock.85887851.27110.rsrch1    

rsrch1 is the name of the machine.

How can I open this folder?

Please e-mail directly.

TIA,

Josh

Howdy!

How do I force Pine to use a different config-file than it usually uses.
I want to use an other outgoing mailserver than the system uses for the
moment.

*argl* It's even in the man--page :-/

- -p config-file	Use config-file as the  personal  configuration file instead
                of the default pinerc.

Sorry for the follow--up to my own message, but I took some time to delve
into the docs and found this:

   The file to be attached must be on the same system as Pine. If you use
   Pine on a Unix machine but have files on a PC or Macintosh, the files
   must be transferred to the Unix system running Pine before they can be
   attached to the message being composed. Please ask your local consultants
   about the correct way to transfer a file to your Pine system as the
   method will vary from site to site.

I don't really get this... What does "on the same system as Pine" mean? Same
file--system? I have several non--u*ix file systems mounted and can attach
files from the alright. Attaching files from a mounted floppy doesn't seem
to be a problem, either.

Or is this supposed to be a practical joke? ^T, /myhome/mydosbox/c:/files ?

TIA,
Robin

What he means is "on the same system" is that if you have to run PINE from
a unix machine while in your UNIX account, then you'll have to have the
files on the system.  If the file system is mounted and "visible" through
that system that PINE is currently running, then you can "technically"
attach those files.

But if you're running PINE say on a UNIX system and you're using a
terminal program to obtain access to your UNIX account/shell, then you'll
need to upload that file to your UNIX directory before you can attach it.
If the system can't see the "drive/file/directory" where your file is on,
then you'll have to move it to where it is visible by the file system
that's running PINE.

That doesn't make sense to me... If I want to attach a file, it has to be
"on the system" independent of the OS I'm using. That's nothing to do with
u*ix or WinDos.

Sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with the OS, either. Ok, if I
wanted to do that with a Win95 file, I'd have to glue a floppy to a brick
and throw it into the computer pool, but that doesn't count, does it?

What's more, there's always a chance of mounting my home system via NFS. I
don't get the "If you use Pine on a Unix machine but have files on a PC or
Macintosh"--part. As a regular user on, say, a university remote system, I
always have to ftp my files to that account, even with u*ix running at home.


Well, forget it... Noone's gonna read the user guide, anyway :-)

Have a nice weekend, yall!

Cheers,
Robin

The Pine-Announce and Pine-Info mailing lists have been moved to a
different server, running different list management software.  These
changes are not expected to affect comp.mail.pine subscribers.  We
apologize if this causes anyone any inconvenience.  

There are a few changes you may want to make note of (optional items
are in "[]"): 

Subscription address was:  Majordomo@CAC.Washington.EDU
New subscription address:  ListProc@U.Washington.EDU

Command to subscribe was:  SUBSCRIBE listname [alt-email-addr]
New command to subscribe:  SUBSCRIBE listname [FOR alt-email-addr] Your Name

Command to unsubscribe was:  UNSUBSCRIBE listname [alt-email-addr]
New command to unsubscribe:  SIGNOFF listname [FOR alt-email-addr]

Further information about listproc can be obtained by sending a
message to ListProc@u.washington.edu with a blank subject and a body
consisting of the single word "HELP".

All current subscriptions have automatically been moved to the new
server.  There is no need to unsubscribe.  Messages to the old
addresses will also be forwarded to the new lists.

Thanks for your interest in Pine!

The Internet system for addressing mail allows for something called 
mail exchange records. For example, there is no machine called 
washington.edu, but there is an MX record for washington.edu which 
says that mail to there is to be sent via the machine 
mx1.cac.washington.edu or mx2.cac.washington.edu.

This is necessary for sites that want to be able to receive mail 
through more than one machine, but it is used in other cases as well.

What you need to do is to find the address of the machine which your 
sister is actually logged into. It may be the same as the mail 
machine, but if it is a large site with a dedicated mail server, then 
that is unlikely. I suggest you send her mail and ask.

There are two Unix programs, nslookup and host, that can be used to 
find out information about the names of machines and various records.  
host is the one I find the most friendly to use. For example, to get a 
list of the mail machines for washington.edu I used the command

host -t mx washington.edu

host washington.edu would tell what machine has that as its real name 
(in this case, none)

Disclaimer: There are many things that can go wrong and it might be 
that your problem is something else entirely. You might try to have 
your sister use "talk" to reach you instead, then if she gets contact, 
the correct command to reply with should be shown.

At some sites, you can use "finger" to find out what machine someone 
is logged into. You have to first find out which machine accepts 
finger requests, of course.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

This is a less serious inquiry...

A few years ago, I recieved an email from a colleague that was actually
animated for PINE. At the beginning of the email, it instructed you to
push the spacebar and it automatically (and quickly!) scrolled through
an exploding cow animation.  I've also seen some type of Thanksgiving
animation, too.  Do those things still exist?

I'm no expert, but I use Pine, and I think this means you have to transfer
the file to your Internet Provider's host machine (i.e., the file and the
Pine program must be on the same machine).

Once its there, I suppose you can point Pine to it.

You can use AOL to check, but it's a bit of work.
What you have to do is connect to AOL, then run a Telnet program.
When the program asks what system to connect to, enter the address for
your home server. Once your there, you'll probably have to login your
account.  If your server has pine, you just type in pine at the
prompt.

Of course, to do this, you need a good Telnet program and the address
for your server.

Yep, they had a copy of that at work but I've lost my copy.  If anyone 
has a copy of it out there, I'd love to get another.

I am using RedHat 4.0, I always have "localdomain incomplete" error msg
whenever I start pine if sendmail is running. My system is a standalone 
system
Does any one know any clue about it ?

I upgraded to WinNT recently, and am trying to make Pine 32bit work with a
PPP connection. I observed the following problem. This problem had been
present some time ago, under Pine 16bit, and I cannot remember the
solution... :-(

Whenever I press the space bar during composing a message, no space is
inserted, but rather, the cursor advances to the next word or line.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
       -  Hans

I am having a problem viewing my attatchments sent from Netscape e-mail 
on a PC, to my Pine account on a Mac, all i get when i try to view them 
are a bunch of wierd characters? Do i have some kind of configuration 
problem, or is my PC's POP3mail via netscape just not able to talk to my 
MAC's Pine program? I realize this is not very detailed, please forgive 
me, im still a rookie. If someone can help me resolve this problem, 
please respond. Thank you :)


Jeff

Does it say exactly that? Or does it say: "user-domain"? Check your .pinerc
for that...

What kind of "wierd characters" Weird as in "binary file" or weird as in
HTML document? If it's a binary, you don't have an application to view the
attachment (i.e. e.g. Word to view a Word document). If it's HTML, you have
to feed it to your Web Browser. Check the extension of the attachment and
get the appropriate application.

Have a nice weekend.

Would anyone be able to tell me how to suppress my address on outgoing
mail it is mainly because several people in my course are having there
names slandered by people who use their alias to send offensive email.
I know it is a stupid question but I have to ask anyway.

Thanks

It's not a stupid question, it's just a bad idea... 

There are several precautions one can take against spam/uce, all of which
can be looked up in the netabuse and spam faqs. For a start, check:

	URL: http://digital.net/~gandalf/spamfaq.html
	
, which is quite canonical. You might also turn to the following newsgroups:

   alt.2600
   alt.spam
   alt.current-events.net-abuse
   news.admin.net-abuse.misc
   alt.hackers
   alt.answers
   news.answers
         
especially if your address has been forged already. Messing with the address
will not stop a criminal, but it will make it unnecessary cumbersome to
reply to your mails.

You might also check procmail to filter out unwanted mails (perhaps to do
something "nice" with them later >;-> ). There are some good anti-spam
recipes available and the people on the procmail list are very friendly and
helpful.

Have a nice weekend.

Later,
Robin

Depends... You can a) telnet your university and read the mail there or b)
make a slip/ppp connection to get the mail home.

ad a)

1. See if you have a telnet program.

2. Check what terminal emulation you have to use to connect.

3. Connect, login, launch pine...

ad b)

1. Talk to the people at your university's help--desk and get the ppp--package
   that they should have.

2. Follow the instructions.


You question is not pine related. Check the correct news group (e.g.
comp.protocols.xy ...)

pine -p config-file

see the Pine manual page.

For your specific case you might just want to use

pine -smtp-server=whatever.fi

You can also change this in Setup Config within pine.

However, if your administrators have made this a _fixed_ config 
option, you will not be able to override it with either method; the 
global config.fixed file always takes precedence.

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

This is incorrect.  If Pine crashes while it is reading the folder or
performing an update, a lock file will be left behind.  That is the only
time.  The lock files are created only when an actual file access is
done,
and are removed immediately afterwards.

Lock files should be timed out (and ignored) by Pine and other mail
software after they are 5 minutes old.

If this is not happening, then something is wrong on your system and it
needs to be investigated and/or reported to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.

My question is: Is "MAIL DROP LOCK" Different from "Lock files" ?

I see that you are not running PC-Pine, so that's not that strange that
you get the error messages you're reporting. When running Pine under a
Unix system, there is no "A:" drive, there are no drives at all! There are
two ways to do this, depending on what your setup is:

	a) you have Unix on your computer, then see Robin's reply on
	   how to do it

	b) you're running Unix on another computer (via Telnet or equal),
	   then you need to send the file from your computer to the one
	   where you read mail, preferrably using a ftp program.

    You cannot *force* another system to provide you with a return
receipt, but you can request it.  Whether or not you will get a receipt
will depend on whether or not the receiving systems honors your request
-- some do and some don't.  Because return receipts are _not_ an
Internet standard, it is sort of pot luck.  The fact that you do not
get a receipt back tells you approximately nothing.  Also, please
understand that even if you do get a return receipt, that tells you
nothing about whether or not the actual recipient has really _read_ 
the message.  It only tells you that your message got there and was
delivered to the recipient's mailbox.

    Anyway, go into your Pine configuration and add the customized
header

        Return-Receipt-To: _your_email_address_

I have a POP3 mailbox that I access over a PPP dialup connection. Ican
get my mail fine with fetchmail but I also want to be able to send mail
from my Linux box with Pine and have the "From" address appearing in the
message to be my POP3 mail address.  Problem is that Pine places
something like root@bogus_name.domain.ca in the field instead of the
desired address. I suppose I could just make an acount with the same
username and call my non-networked machine by the same name as the POP3
server, but I don't really want to do that. Any ideas

Thanks,
Patrick Griffiths

Just add this in your configuration 

customized-hdrs          = Return-Receipt-To:

and fill in the header with your address whenever you want it.

NB: This will work or not, depending on the remote system ...
but that's all you can do, as far as I know, apart from giving 
a phone call. Apart from the way of configuring the mail agent, 
this is independent of Pine.

Subject: problem posting NEWS
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello,
    The installation of pine here refuses to post news.  The 
following diagnostic is (briefly) displayed:

   [Error posting message: 441 from: address not in Internet syntax]

I tried to get some debugging output with the -d option,
(-d 1,  -d 9,  -d9) but -d does not seem to work either.

Pine version: apparently 3.91  (from the global config file)
OS version  : solaris 2.5

I don't know who compiled it, or how, since Solaris is not
supported by the pine folks.  "xrn" posts news just fine, so
the problem is not evidently, in the news server.

Hi, 
my question, is there a place on the web that I can find more info on
how to edit the headers on Pine, what rules I need to follow, what type of 
headers, etc. Like 
Reply-To:
Return-Receipt-To:
X-password:
I'm not familiar with it and I want to know what rules to follow, like
why Reply-To: Reply need to be capitalized and To, or what the X- means
thanks

      We were experiencing problems with someone trying to dial in
to a DG 4.11 MU02 system for a second or subsequent time.

I ran into something similar on R3.10MU02 which turned out to be a
batch process left behind (intentionally) that was associated with the
login device file. Try using "fuser -u /dev/tty999" to check if this might
be the case for you.

I was wondering how when you use the finger command in unix you can get
the screen to stop scrolling in order to read the names.  If anyone could
help me with this it would be great! Thanks!

Hi Jeanette:

The easiest thing to do is to pipe the output to the "more" program.  To
do this you just type "finger | more" at your prompt.  That vertical line
you see is called a pipe (just in case you didn't know) and it usually is
on the same key as your backslash.

This works also for any command that causes output to continuously scroll
off the screen.  Once you're scrolling using more, you can usually hit the
space bar to scroll another length of the screen.  If you need to stop it
entirely, just hit control-c, or whatever the escape sequence is in the
shell you're using. 

Hope this helps!!!

You don't. Pine is used to *read* the mail. You can, however, set up a
.forward file in your home directory with the address(es) where you want the
mail to be forwarded to. The mail delivery system will use this file to send
the messages to the appropriate place.

Subject: PC-PINE Window size
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I have my window size set the way I want it for PC-Pine, and it will
remember it from session to session as long as I close PC-Pine while
that window is on the screen.  If I close PC-Pine from the icon, it
loses the window size settings!  I found where the information is
stored at the end of the PINERC file.  Is there any way of 'freezing'
the settings so it will remember the window size no matter how I close
the program?

Well, there is PCpine at:
	http://www.washington.edu/pine
but pine as such doesn't have anything to do with irc. You need another
program for that. Check
	http://www.yahoo.com
for that. There are a couple of free irc-clients there.

Dear sir
    During the using of Pine I found a bug in the PINE, I don=B4t know how
it happened.
    The problem happens when I use the command [add] to add a new folder
or use [save] to transport a file from one folder to another folder, if I
give the new folder a name like a: or k: then I can=B4t find the new folder
any more and the file is also lost.=20
    I would be very thankful if you can give me a satisfactory answer,
because I lost some importmant files.

=09I=B4m looking forward to you reply

      regards

=09=09=09=09=09Your sincerely=20

Hello everyone!

I just saw the messages asking about pgp in Pine 4.0... has there been any
thought as to incorporating S/MIME into 4.0?  PGP would be find by me
though...

Is there a 4.0 release date? FAQ??

Karl,
Regarding PGP/MIME and S/MIME, the limitation is that current versions of
Pine don't let you get at entire multipart objects, as is needed for
multipart/signed processing.  Pine 4.00 will let you define mailcap
entries for multipart entities. 

As with current PGP processing, the real PGP or S/MIME work would be done
by external processes, but unlike now, where PGP handlers are invoked via
Pine's filter mechanism, with PGP/MIME and S/MIME, the handlers would be
invoked via mailcap entries. 

Sorry, we don't have a release date yet, but work is progressing.

I don't know why the updatews folder is missing.  The way our system
is set up, I put the files into a staging area on our development
system, then issue a command to do some behind-the-scenes-magic to
update the files on the production servers.  I've checked the staging
area and it looks good, but for some reason the data is not getting
copied to the production servers.  I've notified our system gurus, so
the updates should be back soon.

Sorry about the inconvenience!

Great answer!

May I ask another question?  Are the files /usr/mail/userid and
/usr/mail/.userid.pop in the same format?  I have to assume that they are
according to your answer.  This is what I missed.  Had I known they are
the same, I might have thought of copying it over ... :-)

Cheers!

I'm using 32-bit PC-Pine 3.96 on Windows 95, attempting to
print to a Unix printer queue via Hummingbird Maestro.

Worked fine with 3.95, but with 3.96 I get the select printer
dialogue box but when I click on OK I get:

	Error starting print job: Can't start document

Any ideas?

    To be honest, this question is actually irrelevant to this
newsgroup, which is not a tutorial for Un*x.  However, you can 
do either of two things:

        finger _so_and_so_ | more

        finger _so_and_so_ > junk

The first will show you the output screen at a time.  The second will
put the output in a file called "junk" in the current directory.

Subject: Amiga Pine Problem
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I download pine 3.93 for the Amiga and was amazed at how much
nicer it was than 3.91.  Anyway, when I put the server names in
the .pinerc file and try to check my mail I get a 'no such host'
error.  When I ping the hosts they are there.  The server 
name seems to be correct in the error message. e.g.
pop01.ny.us.ibm.net.   Also I get a message like 'can't file
>NIL:'  which is really strange.

I am using AmiTCP 4.0 demo, and the UUCP stuff.

Any hints?

Just compiled 3.96 and when I choose Setup and then Update
I get the following error message:

[SELECT failed: Can't open mailbox #news.updates.pine396: no such folder]

I tried it in 3.95 and in that version it works fine.  Did somebody
forget to copy some files on the update server for 3.96?

Is there a way to find out if anyone is
"fingering" my user name?  Are there records
kept of this?  Are there automatic records kept?

If someone "fingers" my user name, say, 20 times,
will i get a notification of this fact?  200 times?

I am using Pine.

Thanks.

(Please respond via email)

Subject: global alt-addresses?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Greetings,

I am running 3.9.5 on Sol 2.5.1.

Due to a hardware upgrade, our global fixed user-domain changed from
system-a to system-b.  Now all sent-mail folders when viewed in index mode
show the sender ($USER@system-a) instead of the recipient.

I know each user can change alt-addresses to theiraccount@system-a to fix
this problem.  What I am curious about is whether I can add some entry
to the global pine.conf to fix it for all users?  Something like

	alt-addresses=system-a

	or 

	alt-addresses=$USER@system-a

both of which I have tried and do not work.  Any thoughts?  Would 3.96 
possibly support this?

	-Dave

Dear Knowledgeable Person,

   When I'm composing e mail messages, I see a message on the bottom of
the screen -- "error closing file"  What is that? What shall I do about
it? (I'm seeing it as I write this.)

   I have one idea. Sometimes when I send a message, and it says Y? I push 
"Y" twice, and the computer then takes it as a command to PRINT the
message I've just answered, and I don't know where that goes, but that
file must be very full now and since its all a mistake- I don't want
anything printed -- I'd like to get rid of it.

  I'd appreciate any help!   Best wishes,

                    Professor Arlie Hochschild

Hello, my name is Levon.  One of my friends from Europe has 
send me some decoded pictures of him and his family.  I really 
would like to undecode the pictures, however i don't know how
to make this work.  Here is what my friend told me.

1.  First,  He said that he has made three photos in a format.jpg.
2. Second,  He then decoded them in one file( the achiever arj.exe).
3.  Then he has coded a file .arj in ASC2-FORMAT  by using the
     uuencode.exe and broke the file in to seven sections.  The 
     lenght of each section was 30KB.     

To undecode the files he told me to:

1.  Decode files from a format.uue in to a format.arj with the 
     programm called uudecode.exe.
2.  Decode a file photo.arj in a format.jpg by the achiever Orj.exe
3.  Overlook the files on any graphic editor.  

My problem is that:

1.  I don't have the uudecode programm.( how to download?)
2.  I have WIN 95 and I am not sure if the program would work without
     the reall dos.
3.  I can't understand what is the "achiever Orj.exe"

I have spend enormous time triyng to figure this out, however I still 
can't understand how to get an undecoding programm from the net and 
how to make it work.  I would be more than thankfull to you if you could 
help me with my problem.   Thank-you very much and
                                                                  Sorry for taking your time.

Greetings everyone,

	I'm running FreeBSD 2.2 Release and just upgraded to pine 3.96.
For some reason, it kept saying earth is a incomplete mail domain while it
works fine on mercury.  I typed hostname and it showed earth.GAIANET.NET
while domain showed GAIANET.NET.  Any ideas what's going on?  Thanks.

Hi:

I am using PINE 3.94 on a Power Macintosh with a UNIX server.  I am having
printing problems with certain email senders.

When I try to print their particular messages, the screen freezes and I
have to reboot the computer.  The messages are perfectly readable on the
screen.  If I forward the messages to myself, the message appears on the
screen with "$" signs at the end of some lines.  If I manually edit the
message by putting in hard returns at each "$" sign and then send the
message I can print the message.

Obviously whatever mailing program the person or persons are using allows
the text lines to be too long.  Is there an easier way to correct this.
Is their a setup command or something of the sort in PINE that will fix
this?

Any help would be much appreciated!

Mary Jane Pattillo

If I am not mistaken, from shell...

cd /usr/mail/                                = Change to mail directory.

ls -l /usr/mail/userid /usr/mail/.userid*    = Check status of mail box.

cat /usr/mail/.userid.pop >>/usr/mail/userid = Copy backup file to mail 
                                               box.

cp /dev/null /usr/mail/.userid.pop           = Clean out POP backup.

This should fix the inbox that the POP client failed to restore. If I have
missed the point completely, sorry.

C-ya,

hello

I am trying to retrieve an email of mine from pine. My objective is to
save my mail to a directory in my PC. I wonder if that is possible  and
how it could be done. 

The e-mail is a computer program in fortran. I want to retieve it as a
fortran file. Any feed back on this is greatly appreciated. 

my e-mail address is:    bmekalle@acs.ucalgary.ca

thanks

Bahaa

Take your webbrowser and go to:

Check the computer/tools/archivers section or thereabouts...

Man, you *do* have real Dos. Win95 is Dos 7.0 plus a &"$/& GUI... There is
an arj version that comes with a GUI, too... All you need is a mouse and a
lobotomy.

  >3.  I can't understand what is the "achiever Orj.exe"

It's a tool that (un)compresses files. It also allows you to create "spanned
archives", i.e. break up large files into manageable chunks to send via
email.

So here's what you do:

	1. Save the attachments into a directory (preferrably \tmp).

	2. Get uudecode and arj off the internet.

	3. Put those in your search path. \windows\command would be a good
	   choice.

	4. Say uudecode *.uue.

	5. Say arj x -vy *.arj (this will glue the spanned archives
	   together).

	6. View those files. In case you don't have an image viewer, either, 
	   Netscape can view them. Otherwise grab lview or vueprint off
	   yahoo, too.

Well, while you're at yahoo, get the internet faq... You'll be amazed how
easy all of this is once you know _how_ and _where_ to search for
information.

Did I say that I hate MS?

Well, afaik you shouldn't be able to mess with the inbox as a user, but

	mv /usr/mail/.userid.pop ~/foo.mail 

might be a "cleaner" solution, anyway.

	cp /dev/null /usr/mail/.userid.pop 

will copy /dev/null to /usr/mail/.userid.pop. Not that it would work, 
though :-)

	more ~/foo.mail 

will let you read the file. (Hey, Lea, I didn't say "less"... >:-> )

Later,
Robin

Hmmm... What exactly do you mean by "retrieve"? Since you're using Mozilla
*argl*, I think you're running pine at your university and don't have a
modem at home...

1. V(iew) the attachment.
2. S(ave) the file to your home dir.
3. Check if you have mtools. If so, you can simply say:
	mcopy ~/filename a:
4. If you don't have mtools, you need to check if a floppy drive is mounted
   and accessible on your system. You might want to try:
   	cp ~/filename /dev/fd0 or
   	cp ~/filename /floppy.

If you have a modem, you can ftp the file to your home computer. Ask your
local help-desk for further information..

Later
Robin

       On the package it said: "Requires MS Windows 3.11 or better"  
	       			      ...  so I got myself Linux. 

How's that for a start?

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.

I don't see why not, if you have a program like Eudora crash, how else 
would you restore you inbox when your not connected by PPP?
        
I offered the advice, if anything, you have misdirected this E-Mail. It    
should have been sent to Jie Yuan.

: 	mv /usr/mail/.userid.pop ~/foo.mail 
: 
: might be a "cleaner" solution, anyway.

The mail was not in his home directory, but instead in /usr/mail/. I don't
see what is wrong with repairing the problem where the problem was located.

: 	cp /dev/null /usr/mail/.userid.pop 
: 
: will copy /dev/null to /usr/mail/.userid.pop. Not that it would work, 
: though :-)

The point was to clean the pop mail inbox after it contents was put back
where it belonged. 

: 	more ~/foo.mail 
: 
: will let you read the file. (Hey, Lea, I didn't say "less"... >:-> )

Again, check the original message, this is not the location that the
original poster said it was located.

C-ya,

   $$$YOU WILL NOT REGRET READING THIS$$$

Please take five minutes to read this article: it will change your life,

just like it did mine. It's true!! You can make up to or over $40,000 in
4
to 6 weeks, maybe sooner! I swear I'm not lying to you, and this is not
a scam! If you're interested read further: if not, then don't choose to
participate. However, please download and print this article and give it

to someone else who may wish to take advantage of the chance of a
lifetime.

It's a true story and it goes something like this:

A little while back, I was browsing through the newsgroups and came
across an article similar to this, that said you could make thousands of

dollars in a few weeks with only an initial investment of $5. So I
thought, "Yeah right, no way, it must be a scam." But I kept seeing the
article in many newsgroups, so I was curious. Anyway, it said to send $1

to each of the 5 (five) names and addresses listed in the article. You
then place your name and address at the bottom of the list in the fifth
position, and then post the amended article in at least 200 newsgroups
or
send mail to 200 people (there are thousands). "No catch, that was it."

Mailing 200+ people may take a good while, but if you download a nice
little mass mailer such as: Mass Mailer v1.0 coded by H and D it will
automatically get as many names as you want (up to 99,999) and send a
specified letter or text file to all of those random people. Think about

the rate of return for doing just that? :) It's very simple to obtain,
ask
around or hang out in the lobby for awhile, it's a great program.

---

So after thinking it over and talking to a few of my friends, I tried
it.

I figured what have I got to lose except 5 stamps, 5 envelopes and a
mere
$5.00. Right??

Well guess what . . . within 7 days, I started getting some responses in

the mail! I was shocked!! I still figured it would not amount to
anything,
and didn't give it another thought. But then the money kept coming in,
tripling in size and multiplying by 10 - 20 times the amount that I got
in
the first week!! In my first week I made $25. But by the end of the
second
week, I had a total of over $1000!! In the third week I had over
$10,000,
and it was still growing. This is now my forth week, it's incredible,
I've
made close to $42,000 and the mail is still pouring in. --- Let me tell
you
how this works and more importantly, WHY IT WORKS . . . If you are still

reading this then stop and PRINT a copy of this NOW, so you can get
information from it, and begin earning money today. The process is very
simple, and it consists of just 3 (three) easy steps:

$$$ STEP #1 $$$

On 5 separate pieces of paper write the following words: "PLEASE ADD ME
TO
YOUR MAILING LIST." In this way you are not just sending a dollar to
someone, you are paying for a ligitimate service. You are being added to
a
mailing list for whatever service they chose to provide you...??? BE
SURE
TO INCLUDE YOUR NAME AND COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS since you will be
added
to their mailing list. This is all legal because you are paying for a
service. You can check title 18, section 1302 and 1342 of the US postal
and lottery laws.

NOW get five $1 or five $5 or five $10 bills and place ONE inside each
piece of paper that you just wrote on so that the bill will not be seen,

place one in all five envelopes and seal them. That is: five envelopes,
each with one piece of paper that you wrote on (be sure that you wrote
the
above phrase on the paper, this is what makes it legal), plus a $1 bill
hidden inside (this is the minimum fee for the Mailing list service). It

is a good Idea to also include the position number of the person to
facilitate their book keeping and so that they can gauge the progress of

the article. What YOU are doing is creating a mailing list for yourself,

or your business, etc... which is perfectly legal and the fee is to
cover
any cost that you incur. It's that simple.

Note: $1 is the minimum, that will insure you that they will send it to
200 people or newsgroups. However, the more you send the more people
they
will mail or post the list to. 200 people for the first dollar and 450
people for each additional dollar. So for just $25 you could have each
of
the five people sending to 2000 people or newsgroups each. That's 10,000

plus the 200+ people that you send it to. It is your decision, but the
more the better.

FYI, you are "mailing" the following five people the $1 and note but you

are "e-mailing" 200+ or posting in 200+ newsgroups this letter with your

name in position # 5:

$$$$$ 1  GREG THOMPSON
         3133 Woodland Ridge Blvd.
         Baton Rouge, LA 70816 USA

$$$$$ 2  LEIF SANONESS
         870 E. El Camino Real #96
         Mountian View. CA 94040 USA

$$$$$ 3  MICHAEL REKAS
         608 Austin Lane
         Herndon, VA 20170 USA

$$$$$ 4  DOUG FOGGIN
         #902 - 1005 Jervis Street
         Vancouver, BC V6E 3T1 CANADA

$$$$$ 5  ERIC ARMSTRONG
         1868-E McKelvey Hill Dr.
         Maryland Heights, MO 63043 USA

VERY IMPORTANT: When you send your letter with the $1 bill in the
envelope
DO NOT SEND A COPY OF THIS LETTER. Only send the letter with the phrase
"PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST..." etc.!!!

$$$ STEP #2 $$$

Now take the #1 name off of the above list and move the other four names

up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc...) and put YOUR NAME in the #5
position on the list. You can do this by simply retyping this article,
adding your name and making any other editing changes that you need to.
Don't change the article too much however so as to not change the
essence
of it's contents.

$$$ STEP #3 $$$

POST your amended article (with your name at the #5 position) to at
least
200 newsgroups or e-mail it to 200 people. Two hundred is the minimum to

make it work, but the more - the better because you will increase the
exposure of the article to alot more people. The more people that see it

means more people will choose to participate. All you need is to recieve
a
good foundation of returns.

AND THAT'S IT!!! JUST THREE EASY STEPS!!!  You are now in the mail order

business and will start recieving your $1 envelopes from various people
all over the world within just a few days. REMEMBER! The more that you
post this letter with your name on it, the more the chances of receiving
a
higher return on your $5 investment in your new mail order business. You

may want to rent a P.O. Box to facilitate the high volume of mail you
are
about to recieve.

----

LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS PROGRAM WORKS AND IT'S POTENTIAL!

Out of of every 200 postings, let's say you only recieve 5 replies,
which
is very VERY low. So you make $5 with your name in position #5. You
haven't
lost anything, have you? Now then, each person who just sent you a $1
envelope makes their minimum 200 postings (a total of 1000) with your
name
now at position #4. Using the above same reply return on their efforts,
you now recieve 50 (fifty) $1 envelopes. Now you have made $50. Your 50
new agents post their 200 each with your name at position #3 for a total

of 10,000 postings and I think you are starting to get the picture,
Right?
Now you just recieved $500 in the mail. Your name at position #2 means
500
people post their 200 postings equaling 100,000 postings for a return of

$5000.  Your name at position #1 has 5000 people post their 200
postings
and before your name drops off the list you get a return of over
$50,000.
And that's if everybody down the line makes only 200 postings and only 5

responses. Remember the more you post the greater the return.

Estimates are that there are 20,000 to 50,000 new users coming online
EVERDAY!!! Remember, play FAIR and HONEST and THIS WILL WORK, I PROMISE
YOU!!! Make sure that you print off a copy of this article RIGHT NOW!!!
It could change your life. Once you begin recieving money be sure to
record (keep) every name of those that sent you an envelope. You are,
after all, compiling a mailing list of people. Keep good records, pay
your
taxes and always keep an eye on the postings to be sure that everyone is

playing fairly. You know where your name should be!

REMEMBER - HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. WHAT IS $5 TO YOU? IF YOU ARE
LIKE MOST PEOPLE YOU SPEND THAT MUCH ON LOTTERIES EVERY WEEK! WHY NOT
TRY
SOMETHING THAT HAS HIGH POTENTIAL FOR RETURNS. YOU DON'T NEED TO CHEAT
THIS IDEA TO MAKE MONEY. SO PLEASE, PLAY FAIR AND REAP AN HONEST REWARD
FOR
YOUR EFFORTS.

If you try to deceive people by posting the messages with your name
on the list without sending money to the five people already on the list

you will not get much.

Someone who tried it made $150 and that was after 7 - 8 weeks. Then
they sent five $1 and posted it 200 more times, people added them to
their
lists and in 4 - 5 weeks he had an honest return of $10,000. Someone
else
who had some money sent $20 to each of the five people on the list and
he
recieved over $150,000 in a period of just 3 months.  The system really
works! I've already made a large sum of money! Any and everybody can
benefit from this.

That's it!!! Just follow the directions correctly and IT WILL WORK FOR
YOU TOO!!!

What is there in PINE/COMPOSE that when a message is completed,
and you've manually signed your name, pressing the spacebar
results in being taken offline?

	1/ PINE doesn't like spacebar input?

	2/ Improperly installed PINE?

	3/ LNM [line noise monster]?

Subject: File locking problem
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I use Pine 3.95 on Amiga Linux and I have a problem when quiting
Pine.  It wants to move and save messages etc. in the normal 
fashion , however I get messages: 'unable to create lock
/mail/saved-message/lock.xxxxyxyyxy' (not an exact quote:))
I note that the path seems to start from the root directory,
which is not a good thing.  Does anyone know how I fix this?

Subject: Xbiff does not work with pine
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm using xbiff with Pine 3.96 and I can't get the flag to stay-up with
new mail!

If new mail comes in, the flag goes up for about 1.5 mins then lowers
without the new mail being read.  It appears that as soon as pine (or elm)
discovers the message, and adds it as a new message, the flag lowers.

If I have no mailers running the flag will not lower (which is correct).

I am also using procmail for filtering which might contribute to the
problem.

I have tried reading (and understanding [;)]) faqs, mans of: procmail,
pine, comsat, and so on with no avail. 


Anyone have any ideas?


Thanks,

You must create the file .forward (using, for example pico) in which you
place your forwarding address.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi!

I found couple of things that really annoies me about pine.

I like the idea of "dead.letter" and "dead.article", but I
don't like their names or where they are placed, so I was
wondering if you can set a global $VARIABLE that Pine will
read the file name from (with full path). ie: 
setenv DEADLETTER $HOME/doc/.dead.letter
or something like that. I've read the enitre pinerc and I
couldn't find anything.

Also while composing a message once (and having umask 022),
I found that Pine created a tmp file in ~/#pine.20556# and
it was world-readable, so anybody could've read my message
while composing it! :(
Was that a bug? I couldn't re-produce the problem, and I
don't remember on what architecture it was.

Also, I found the `-k' option for `pico' to be extremely
useful. Can I apply this to pine? Is there something I have
to set?

I would really appreciate if you can reply back by e-mail as
well.

Thanks a lot,

Hussam

The documentation for internet message and news formats starts with 'rfc822'
(Request For Comments) and gets more complex.

As for your specific questions, the capitalization is just convention, no
mail software is allowed to depend on a particular type. The X- marks that
this header line is _not_ defined in any of the normal standards, it's
either for human consumption or for use with specific software.
So if you want to add something different use X-Something: eg...

Well, normally you have to get a uudecode some other way, but this is a 
very neat hack. BTW: I'm assuming you're using MSDOS.

You'll have to stick the 5 parts of the message together manually, normally
a uuencoded file looks like this:

begin 644 filename
M5&AI<R!I<R!A;B!%6$5#551!0DQ%($%30TE)('9E<G-I;VX@;V8@555$14-/
M1$4N0T]-(&9O<B!$3U,A("`H268@>6]U"G-A=F4@=&AE(&QI;F5S(&)E;&]W
M(&EN=&\@82!$3U,@9FEL92!N86UE9"!5541%0T]$12Y#3TTL('EO=2!C86X@
M<G5N"FET(&%S(&ES+"!O<B!S96YD(&ET('9I82!E+6UA:6P@=VET:"!N;R!E
M;F-O9&EN9RXI("!4:&4@9FEL92!C<F5A=&5D"G-H;W5L9"!B92`T,"!L:6YE
?<R!L;VYG(&%N9"!C;VYT86EN(#(U.30@8GET97,N"G5L
`
end

Notice all the lines except the 'begin' and the last 3 begin with an 'M'
and are the same length. This is how the uuencoded file you pass to the
uudecode should look.

Good luck.

This is an EXECUTABLE ASCII version of UUDECODE.COM for DOS!  (If you
save the lines below into a DOS file named UUDECODE.COM, you can run
it as is, or send it via e-mail with no encoding.)  The file created
should be 40 lines long and contain 2594 bytes.

Some users have reported that this program locks up their system.  This
is usually because the text editor does not write a CRLF to each line of
the file.  If you have this problem, request "uudecode.bas" by sending
e-mail to listserv@SimTel.coast.net with the command "get uudecode.bas"
in the BODY of the note.  This BASIC program will create a UUDECODE.COM
when run with the command: QBASIC /RUN UUDECODE.BAS

Everytime I download pine3.96gz or Z from the Univ. of Wash,
gzip -d complains that it can't decompress the file.

This has been going on for awhile now.

Where else can I get that version?

Since noone has uttered this request before, you might UTSL. From a quick
glance at the source, it looks like a pretty straight-forward thing.

We've had this "problem" before and didn't come up with a solution within
pine. You might alter umask in your .<shell>rc, you might alter permissions
on your dirs, or (probably the easiest solution) use another editor.
Pico isn't _the_ editor, anyway.

I don't have -k for pico:

Syntax
       pico [-f] [+n] [-nn] [-t] [-v] [-w] [-z] [file]
       
What does it do?

       -k     Causes "Cut Text" command to remove characters from

              than remove the entire line.

Hi,

I have been looking in the setup in Pine 3.95 for a way to turn off...

"Posted message may go to thousands of readers. Really post?"

...without turning off the "Send message?" prompt without confirm.

I don't see why I need only one confirm when sending E-Mail and two when
posting to UseNet. I would prefer one for both.

Does this option exsist?

Thanks for taking the time,


Michael (shotgun@best.com)

When I have multiple instances of PC Pine running and try to update
my address book from one of the instances, I get this message:

  [Error updating address book: File exists]

And no update happens.  Does anyone know if there's any way to
update your address book while multiple instances of pine are

Thanks,

Pine does not support address

"user%domain.name@thro.host.one@thro.host.two"

where mail is sent to user@domain.name thro' the hosts (or servers)
host.two and host.one


Is there any work around to use address like this. (Other than setting the
SMTP server in configuration). Can this feature be added in future
releases of pine ?

        Yes, I know VSNL and the network connections are not so good.  But,
let me give you a tip.  When you use UPPERCASE it is taken to meaning
shouting.  When you connect with VSNL I can understand your shouting....but
best to use lower case.  :-)

        You are using pine in a shell account as you say.  At the present time
PC-Pine does not support "disconnected" mode.  So, you need to talk to the
folks at VSNL and arrange for a POP account.  (I don't think VSNL supports
IMAP.)

Erpin:

I haven't compiled 3.96 yet -- we're using 3.95 on DG/UX 5.4R11 on an 8500
as well. 3.95 needs a small patch to work correctly at R11.  If you
would like I can send you the patch, or if you prefer the binaries. 

For 3.96 it might be worth checking with the dg-users list.  You can
subscribe by sending email to majordomo@ilinx.com with

subscribe dg-users

Can anyone help me with this problem:

When I reply to a long post with only a short reply, I get an error saying
that the new text is less than the quoted text and it won't post.

I have learned that, if I change the > that marks each line of the quoted
text to another character like : , I can post my short answer along with
the long quote.

If the quote is several pages long, however, it can get tedious changing
every > on every line to : . Is there a way in pine which I can change all
>'s on a page to :  ??

Is this doable??

Thanks for any help!!

Greg

HELP!

I'm really getting tired of the Pine spell checker telling me my name is
misspelled. :> Also as a classicist, I have to write a lot of names that 
of course don't appear in the standard word list.  Is there a way to add
words to the list as I can with most word processors?

		Thank-you,

			Geordi Byron

For your own replies, putting this in your .pinerc will do the trick:

# Specifies the string to insert when replying to  message.
reply-indent-string=":"

However, if you want to change all replies in a message, you'd better get
another editor or go for emacs' supercite package right away.

Later,

There is a limit on the length of a single line in the address book. It's
1000 characters. Might that be the limit you're running into? If so you
just need to use continuation lines in the long list. After one of the
comma's separating the list addresses start a new line with a space and
then continue the list. Look at one of the addressbook files that pine
makes to see an example.

we are trying to setup a form to send to our pine users... when trying to 
do this if we use a form in excel and use word as our outlook email editor 
this works but adds many unneeded steps, when trying to use a form ( in 
outlook or excel ) the pine users get a blank message, is there anything 
that can be done to remedy this?

You seem to be using pine for Linux. So you're using ispell. Ispell is
pretty neat, but you have to read some man pages...

Try man ispell for a start, that should get you going. You'll also want to
toy with buildhash (no, not what you're thinking...). Comparing ispell to
the lame stuff that comes with most word processors is a sacrilege, btw.

Later,

Here's something from the netiquette for you, first:

- -    When you join a list, monitor the messages for a few days to get a feel
     for what common questions are asked, and what topics are deemed
     off-limits. This is commonly referred to as lurking. When you feel
     comfortable with the group, then start posting.

- -    See if there is a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for a group that you
     are interested in joining. Veteran members get annoyed when they see
     the same questions every few weeks, or at the start of each semester.


...and now for your "question" on "how to spam people with binaries for
Payless Cashways (aka Brainless Cashews)"...

Yeah, sure... "your" pine users...

You could stick your sorry little heads up a dead pig for a start. But you
could also try the following:

1. Read the f* pine manual.
2. Read the f* mime specs.
3. Apply what you've learned from 1 and 2 to your f* UCE.
4. Get a life.

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.

OK.

Where I used cp was to clean out the .userid.pop file, by placing the
contents of the null device (0=zero) in the file. It works over here.

The reason the two redirects were use, was because it would append the file
and not clobber the file. This was necessary, because in the meantime it
would of been still possible to have received mail in the inbox. So this
would have joined (appened) the two files together. So no mail was lost.

Ownership of your files in the mail box are yours and yours alone if set up
correctly. None of what I wrote gets around that. I can understand if other
ISPs don't like that, but still, you own thoughs files with your userid on
there. 

: Please let us stop this nonsense!

I have no problem with that, the original poster has his mail back and
that, after all, is what matters.

C-ya,

Subject: 3.96: Incorrect error msg?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Under 3.96 or 3.95 when I try to connect to a news server that's not
running (i.e., connection refused) I get the error message

	421 SMTP connection went away!

Shouldn't the error be something like "connection refused by news
server..."?  The current message is rather cryptic and technical
sounding and I dont't see why this condition would have anything to do
with SMTP so the message is misleading.  (Our news collection is set to
"Subscribed *{newsserver/nntp}[]".)

It seems like some code used for SMTP has been reused or is being
shared for NNTP and the message isn't tailored for both.  I did a
little searching in the code but couldn't trace down exactly where this
is happening.

Thanks.

The PINE IMAPD server, as any other IMAP servers, could be used from 
Netscape Mail v4.0 mail agent (included in Netscape 4.0 beta for Windown NT)

However we tested it and still has some problems in handling correctly
the folders.

Pine by itself is a User Agent, thus it cannot be used froma browser.

If you're on a u*ix system, make sure you have your path to the mailcap file
set correctly. Afterwards, assign the program you need to certain mime types
(e.g. lynx to text/html), and that's that.

Later,
Robin

Dear Michael,

here's something from the netiquette for you:

       -    It is considered extremely rude to forward personal email to
            mailing lists or Usenet without the original author's
            permission.

But that's ok, I don't care, anyhow, but:

        -    Keep your questions and comments relevant to the focus of
	     the discussion group.

So, shut up, please, will you? Your way of handling this was *unclean* and
partly *wrong*. If if worked -- fine. But there's no reason to keep telling
the entire world how to abuse a u*ix system, not to mention the syntactical
errors.

Can you please post a sample mailcap entry for handling PGP/MIME

        Why do you think there is a command?  And why do you think you
need to set it up from a command line?

Dear Ed:

I use the shell account primarily.  I like to 
check my mail from other shell accounts without
having to leave the service I'm currently logged
onto.  It's really neat because you can see
if there is anything you to want to respond to and
then continue to work.  It's done like so at the
bash:

pine -f {whatever your mailhost is}

I've already set up IMAP in my account.  It's just
that a friend of mine also uses the shell for
convenience and wants to do the same thing I
can.  I don't remember I did it the first time.  
Next time I'll write it down.

I happened to find someone in tech support that day who
who knew the command.  He was very knowledeable 
and knew exactly what to do....it was very simple.  
He had me type a command at the bash and it was done.  
It's just that I can't remember what the command was
or locate the person that had that expertise.  It
took seconds and there is a little e-mail that
is produced and it stays in your inbox (it contains
configuration information and there is a warning
not to delete it.

The current people in tech support don't know what
the command is...I thought someone out there
in pineland would know.

Regards

Kathleen

To any one who can help;
I ma very new in this world of internet. And there are many things i Don't
understand. I have pine in my home computer but my office uses another
system of E-mailing Brainnet. The problem is that when I ask my office to
send me files on my pc they attach them as binary files, and i have not
been able to figure out how to dettach them and turn them into text? Also
how can I send a binary file to my office if the file is in one of the
word processing programmes?
All help will be appreciated

You first say "let us stop this nonsense"! Which I say "I have no problem

You just don't want to give this up do you. I tried to, I even agreed with

that wasn't good enough for you apparently.

You should see a message saying:

Parts/attachments:
   
   1 Shown   25 lines  Text
   2         28 KB     Application, ""

at the top of your mail, and:

  [Part 2, ""  Application/OCTET-STREAM (Name: ".tkmandatabase.gz")  38KB]
  [Cannot display this part. Press "V" then "S" to save in a file]

at the bottom. Save the message, launch the appropriate application (fdisk
for Winword documents, for example...), and you're there.          

  >Also how can I send a binary file to my office if the file is in one of

Q: How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
A: Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand" Pine's
   attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment does not
   have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save the
   attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available program
   which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie Mellon. It
   is available at:
   
	ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack

As for the rest: Type either say
	
	strg+g

in the Attchmnt-field of your message, or read the pine FAQ, from which
I've drawn the above QandA. It's available from:

	Pine Information Center:  http://www.washington.edu/pine
	       
Later,
Robin

Subject: Where is the news collection?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I am using pine 3.95 now. I wonder where pine puts its news group list in.
When I used netsape, I put one new newsgroup in. But then I open pine news 
reader the new added news group is already there. Why? Does it mean they are 
using the same news group list? But where is this list? I searched all the 
home directory, but I didn't find something like news News directory.

Subject: SPAM procmail filter for Bcc?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

It appears that many of the more recent spammers may be using Bcc to send
me their e-mail drivel.  In order to combat this, I am trying to add a
procmail filter which will send any e-mail with my username in the Bcc
field to a default folder.  This is what I've put into my .procmailrc
file: 

:0:
* ^Bcc.*smachol
IN.testing

However, when I've tested this by Bcc'ing myself from another account, the
mail is getting through just fine and nothing shows up in my IN.testing
folder.

I would appreciate any help I can get in finding a way to use a procmail
filter on the Bcc field.

Does anyone know where the proper place to get information on how the

I need to know where and how the default mail spool is defined.  Is this a
function of sendmail or the server?

It's a file called ".newsrc". The "." means it's invisible. Check your
.pinerc for the appropriate settings. Since you don't seem to be overly
familiar with u*ix systems, you'd better ask your local help desk for
further information.

*Don't* just mess with these files.

You need a filtering program. As can be read in the FAQ, the on-line help
and any other documentation on pine, pine is an email program, not an email
filtering program. Try procmail:

SOURCE
This program is part of the procmail mail-processing-pack- age (v3.11pre4
1995/10/29) available at your nearest USENET comp.sources.misc archive, or
at ftp.infor- matik.rwth-aachen.de as pub/packages/procmail/proc-
mail.tar.gz.
              
MAILINGLIST
There  exists  a mailinglist for questions relating to any program in the
procmail package: <procmail@informatik.rwth-aachen.de> for submitting
questions/answers. <procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de>

Subject: win32 console-mode pine?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm interested in trying pine out on my Windows NT system - for mail and
news of course.  But one of my main motivations here is that I want a
clean, basic CONSOLE MODE WIN32 application.  The version of "PC" pine
that I got a hold of uses the Windows GUI.  This is not what I was
looking for.  The display looks kind of yucky to me - the text is very
small at my display resolution.  Anyway, I'd like to be able to telnet
into the machine and run pine from a nearby DOS box (which is not
connected to the internet).

Is there a version of pine available for win32 that is console mode
only, just like the classic Unix stuff?

Dear Sirs: 
     I'm glad to tell you that I regularly use Pine program for sending
and receiving E-mail messages, and I enjoy it. At the same time I'd like
to ask you to do me a little favor. 
     I began to work in Internet just a few weeks ago, and I'm not
experienced user yet. A month ago I received a file from your organization
which describes the last changes in Pine program. I'm very pleased to you
for it, but unfortunately, I don't know all Pine features which existed
before. In order to get complex imagination and knowledge of Pine3.9, I'd
like to ask you to send me the whole manual of the program. It would help
me very much in accomplishing Internet generally, and particularly in
using E-mail. 
     I'll be very grateful if you supply me with materials which I
requested. I'm looking forward to hear from you. 
                              Sincerely yours,
                              Maxim Chardymsky

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Subject: Configure Pine to retrieve ISP mail??
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am using linux on a PC and would like to use pine to retrieve my email from 
my ISP.  I read somewhere that it is possible to configure pine to retrieve 
mail without having smail or sendmail daemons running on my linux machine.  
Does anyone know if this is possible and what I need to do to configure pine?

Thanks 
Robert

I am in awe of the game between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid , which i saw
on Spanish tv channel last night 10.00pm.....i live in new jersey, usa

At half time the score was 0-3 to Atletico......then it all happened !!!!!!!

Barcelona score 2 quick goals to make it 2-3, then straight after Barcelona
scored their 2nd goal, Atletico scored immediately to make it 2-4.

Ronaldo is a fantastic player...........then the final score was 5-4
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What a game what an atmosphere.............I have never seen a come back from
0-3 by a team and win by 5-4.............it was an amzaing game and i was so
lucky to see it.....albeit, delayed recording from which day i dont know,
because i dont understand spanish.........anyway.........I am british and
support Man Utd, who are in the semi finals of the Champions cup versus
Borussia Dortmund.....Juventus play Ajaz in the other..............Spanish
football is great if this what happens every week !!!!

    Well, for starters, your question has *nothing* to do with Pine,
although you posted it on the Pine newsgroup.  It would be appropriate
for the Procmail mailing list rather than comp.mail.pine.

    However.......  One scheme that I have found that works somewhat
well is to check whether the incoming mail has a To:-like field with my
email address in it.  If it does not, there is a good chance it is
spam, and I have procmail deliver it to a special folder where I can
check it out later, just in the off chance that it could be legitimate
mail (as has happened once).

    My recipe looks like this:

Greetings:

I just wanted to share something with the group.  I
don't know if this has been posted already so I
apologize for the duplication.

The University of Washington has a wonderful
page on IMAP.  The URL is:

http://www.imap.org

It's been really helpful to me and a wonderous
source of information and I've been seeing many
questions on the list about IMAP so I just
wanteed to share it with in the hope that it
could be helpful.

Sorry if its old news.

Kathleen

Subject: Configuring Pine for ISP use
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: Text/Plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi there:
I would like to configure pine running under Linux to be able to retrieve and 
send mail via my ISP.  1)  how do I map my username on my linux machine to my 
email name on the ISP so that it shows up correctly in the From: field?
2) How do I configure pine to read the mailbox on my ISP.  I've tried using 
IMAP but I don't think my ISP provides this, can I use POP and if so how?

Thanks

Robert

Thanks Felixx, but wouldn't this then force me to know know ahead of
time where the spam is coming from?  What about spam from such sites
as AOL or Netcom?  I don;t want to trash all messages from users on
these sites just because of a few bad apples. 

The point of my question was - how do I filter on the "Bcc:" field?
If I could do this, then I can effectively eliminate any spam sent to
me usinf Bcc.

Another idea occurs to me.  How about automatically filtering any
email that does NOT have my address in the "To:" field?  Obviously,
this isn't perfect, but I would at least like to know how to do this
with procmail.

Hello, Steve?

Here's what the FAQ *hinthint*

Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of other
programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For details on
selection and configuration of such programs, see the Filtering Mail FAQ (by
Nancy McGough) at one of the following locations:

ad 1.:
Domain Names

Domain names are used to uniquely name each host on the Internet. A domain
name has a number of parts separated by periods. Each label represents a
level in the hierarchy. An example of a name is:
              olive.cac.washington.edu
In this domain name the top-level label is edu, indicating it is at an
educational institution, the second-level label is washington, indicating
the University of Washington. cac is a specific department within the
University of Washington, and olive is the host name.
The top-level names are assigned by Internet organizations, and other names
are assigned at the appropriate level. The Domain Name Service, DNS, is the
distributed database used to look up these names. Pine relies on domain
names in multiple places. A domain name is embedded into the message-id line
generated for each piece of email. A domain name is needed to contact an
IMAP server to get access to remote INBOXes and folders. Most importantly,
domain names are needed to construct the From: line of your outgoing
messages so that people on the Internet will be able to get email back to
you.
On UNIX systems, you can set the domain via the user-domain variable in the
Pine configuration file, or rely on the file /etc/hosts which usually sets
the name of the local host. While Pine can often deliver email without the
domain name being properly configured, it is best to have this set right.
Problems can usually be solved by adjusting the system's entry in the
/etc/hosts file. The fully-qualified name should be listed before any
abbreviations.
        128.95.112.99 olive.cac.washington.edu olive
is preferred over
	128.95.112.99 olive olive.cac.washington.edu
                
(From the Pine FAQ)

ad 2.:
Can Pine be used with a POP server?

As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office Protocol)
server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the message INBOX on a
POP3 server using the folder definition syntax
	{pop3server/pop3}INBOX
where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this method
accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline mode, which POP
was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server with Pine does not
preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered, Deleted, etc.) between
sessions.
As an alternative, a program such as popclient can be used to download email
from a POP server to a local Unix account, where it can then be accessed
with Pine. One location from which popclient can be obtained is:
         ftp://ftp.mal.com/pub/pop/
         
(From the Pine QandA)

Thanks Robin.  Yes, I saw Paul's message and responded to him
directly.  I had seen other message about procmail on the pine
newsgroup so I inadvertantly thought mine would be ok too.

And thanks for the mailing list addresses, butI didn't want to have to
subscribe to a whole mailing list just to get the answer to one
question.

You're right, but unfortunately, that'll affect other users.
Or I might do it specificly for me, "hqasem" == $USER then
put it wherever I want to! :)

I prefer to keep my umask as 022, but would like to know
more about the problem, and when does it occur.

Someone had followed this message with an answer, but here
it is again:
     -k   Causes "Cut Text" command to remove characters from the
          cursor  position  to  the  end  of the line rather than
          remove the entire line.

In fact, I found it in pine! I needed to add
"compose-cut-from-cursor" to my feature-list.

Thanks a lot!

Get the source, hack it and put pine in ~/bin. Or do I get sth wrong?

I just spent all day writing an assigment for my economics class.  The
moment I finished and went to proofread, the cursor froze and the words 
NO CARRIER
appeared on the screen.  I was forced to quit the program.  I reconnected
and found that my paper had been completely lost. This has happened
before, usually it asks if I want to continue with my interrupted message.
What I wrote was very good, I don't want nor have the time to do it again.
Can you please help me to find my lost message?  The method I used for the
address was to pull up an old letter and simply press 'R' for reply - if
that information helps at all.  the address was
Widerqui@fasecon.econ.nyu.edu.  Please help me.

Come to think of it, Bcc means Blind Carbon Copy... There is no Bcc field in
the header, at least none I can find. Wouldn't make sense, anyway, would it?

The BCC line is in the header when it leaves the sender, but at the
receiving end it is stripped off by Sendmail (or whatever MTA your local
system uses) before the message is delivered to your local MDA and
then to your Inbox.

	Sorry, your message is lost.  

	There is another message in its place, however.  That message is
something everyone should know.  *Never* type in a long (or even short)
important email over a dialup connection.  No matter how much effort is
put into making the systems fault tolerant your message is bound to get
lost at the most inopportune time.  (I think a guy named Murphy would
have said it better.  :-) :-) )  You should always compose important
messages offline and upload them when it is time to send.

	Our sympathies....

	*Not* always true.  It is only true in the case of a badly
designed UA.  Most UA's will not put the Bcc: header there, they will
simply call sendmail (or whatever) to deliver the mail with a complete
list of receipients (sendmail makes no distiction between To: and Cc:)
and only have To: and Cc: fields in the header portion.  They do this
since they can't rely on a particular version of sendmail or other
MTA to strip out the Bcc: header.  Remember, the Text you see in the
headers are generally not used by the MTAs.  They are used only by
the UAs.  The MTAs use envelope information which is conveyed via a
different channel.

Subject: pgppine - decrypt problem
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


	Using Pine v3.95-2 in conjunction with pgppine on
a linux box I've run into a problem with decryption of messages
sent from pgp-aware mailers running under DOS/Win.  Messages
from other Unix boxes are fine.

	Decryption fails due to incorrect line lengths, which
I believe stems from the DOS cr/lf.  Command line decryption
of these same messages works flawlessly, so I believe I've
overlooked some setting in Pine to deal with the conversion.

	Is anyone aware of a method to deal with this problem?
Thanks for any suggestions.

Mike

...USING PINE'S COMPOSER, that is.

A more fully featured editor like Emacs would be saving to disk as you
go along, and thus at worst you would lose the last few lines.

Pine's composer could have been designed to do this, but was not,
reflecting its writers' belief that it is for short email messages
only, although Pine's users may not realize this.  By now, I think
we'd have to call this a bug.


> You should always compose important messages offline and upload them

Argh!  Saving to ascii and uploading and inserting/attaching is a
miserable experience.  If people have to compose offline they might as
well use PC mail software.

Subject: Changing outbound address for some users
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I am not sure if this is best approached through sendmail or pine:

For some users, I would like outgoing mail to be addressed as if coming 
from an entirely different address - rather than coming from 
host.subdomain.domain.org, I want it to come from domain.org.
Also the user name will be different because the mail forwarder on 
domain.org expects full names rather than userids.

To put it another way, say my real email address on this machine is 
"mcruz@fnord.yale.edu" but I would like my outgoing mail headers say it
is "miguel.cruz@yale.edu". 

Pine lets me change the user-domain but not the userid. In sendmail.cf 
I see where I could change the domain as well, but that would apply
to all rather than some users.

Is it possible to do this selectively?

No, it doesn't. But never mind that...

Are you seriously claiming that you were writing an assignment in pine? If
so, and if you've been using the vanilla version, there is is file 

	dead.letter

in your home dir. Try saying:

	more ~/dead.letter

from you CLI. But since pine (?) didn't ask you for it, it's likely lost.
Ask your help desk, this doesn't look like a pine problem. Also ask them how
to use another editor, one that allows you to make backup copies.

BTW, there's this pretty neat field in your header... "Subject" --- make
sure to fill in something sensible, please, will you?

Later,
Robin

You need to talk to the author of the script, Roland Rosenfeld, who is a
very friendly and helpful guy. By the way, if you're tired of typing your
password every time, check the hacked pgp-pine "papp" by Aldo Valente.

In most cases, emacs takes longer to start up than I need to type the
message. Besides, it has its own mailers, which are better than pine but far
too heavy for most people. And where do you think a dead.letter comes from?

"We" = you, one should think. Reading the FAQ will tell you that you can
invoke another editor implicitly and if you like, you can invoke emacs.

                               ^^^^^^^^^

Notice the restriction? Not always, but only for important messages.

Well, whatever...

There is no perfect method for detecting spam.  Either you will be to 
restrictive, and lose non-spam mail or let some spam in.  

However, there are several places on the web that list the domains where 
spam is all that is sent.  Make a filter from such a list.  

Another thing to do, is read the headers of the spam you get.  A lot of 
spammers use the generic spam mailers (i.e. Floodgate), and you can kill 
this sort of stuff off like so:

:0
*^X-mailer:.*floodgate
/dev/null

:0
*!(To|Cc):.*smachol@
/dev/null

make sure you filter your any mailing lists you are subbed to, before 
doing this though.  

And when filtering mailing lists, you are best off filtering on something 
the list puts into the headers.  Not the site where the list came from.

You cannot kill time without injuring eternity.

	Well, 99 out of 100 times you will be able to continue composing
email with pine after a communications interrupt.  (Happens in India "all" 
of the time...  :-) :-) )  Not all people care to learn Emacs or other
"full featured" editors since the term "full featured" often implies "more
complex".

	I suspect you are assuming someone is using a Word Processor of
the MS-Word varity such that they would have to choose "save to ascii".
I dare say many folks still use "notepad".  And, as noted, I only
suggest doing this for important emails...so I doubt it will burden 
the average person all that much.

	As for using PC mail SW....yes that is an option.  Of course the
SW has to support disconnected mode.

   	    	     *** W A R N I N G !!! ***
		
		
If you would hate to see a bad thing happen to any of YOUR friends, please
read this important message we received from out Corporate Headquarters !!!

			** High Priority **

		Please read and heed this message:

    *** A new virus that is being transmitted via Internet!!! ***

There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet.  If you
receive an e-mail message with the subject line "Better Times," DO NOT read
the message, DELETE it immediately. Some miscreant is sending e-mail under
the title "Better Times" worldwide. If you get anything like this,

		***  DON'T DOWN LOAD THE FILE! ***

The FCC released a warning last Wednesday concerning a matter of major
importance to any regular user of the Internet. Apparently a new computer
virus has been engineered by a user of GERMAN TELEKOM that is unparalleled
in its destructive capability. Other more well-known viruses such as
"Socha", "Airwolf", and "Michaelangelo" pale in comparison to the prospects
of this newest creation by a warped mentality. What makes this virus so
terrifying, said the FCC, is the fact that no program needs to be exchanged
for a new computer to be affected and spread through the existing e-mail
systems of the Internet.

Once a computer is infected, one of several things can happen.  If the
computer contains a hard drive, that will most likely be destroyed. If the
program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed in an
ms-nt-4.0-complexity infinite binary loop - which can severely damage the
processor if left running that way too long.

Not only that, but it will scramble any disks that are even close to your
computer. It will recalibrate your refrigerator's coolness setting so all
your ice cream goes melty. It will demagnetize the strips on all your credit
cards, screw up the tracking on your television and use subspace field
harmonics to scratch any CD's you try to play.

It will give your ex-girlfriend your new phone number.. It will mix Kool-aid
into your fishtank. It will drink all your beer and leave its socks out on
the coffee table when there's company coming over. It will put a dead kitten
in the back pocket of your good suit pants and hide your car keys when you
are late for work.

"Better Times" will make you fall in love with a penguin. It will give you
nightmares about circus midgets. It will pour sugar in your gas tank and
shave off both your eyebrows while dating your current girlfriend behind
your back and billing the dinner and hotel room to your Visa card.

It moves your car randomly around parking lots so you can't find it. It will
kick your dog. It will leave libidinous messages on your boss's voice mail
in your voice! It is insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to
behold. It is also a rather interesting shade of mauve.

"Better Times" will give you Dutch Elm disease. It will leave the toilet
seat up. It will make a batch of Methamphetamine in your bathtub and then
leave bacon cooking on the stove while it goes out to chase gradeschoolers
with your new snowblower.

It always travels to new computers the same way, in a text e-mail message
with the subject line reading "Better Times." Avoiding infection is easy
once the file has been received simply by NOT READING IT! The act of loading
the file into the mail servers ASCII buffer causes the "Better Times"
mainline program to initialize and execute. The program is highly
intelligent - it will send copies of itself to everyone whose e-mail address
is contained in a receive-mail file or a sent-mail file, if it can find one.
It will then proceed to trash the computer it is running on.

The bottom line is:   If you receive a file with the subject line "Better
Times," delete it immediately! Do not read it. Rest assured that whoever's
name was on the "From" line was surely struck by the virus. Unfortunately,
most novice computer users will not realize what is happening until it is
far too late. Luckily, there is one sure means of detecting what is now
known as the "Better Times" virus. Don't warn your friends and local system
users of this newest threat to the Internet! It could save them a lot of
time and money.

 DON'T PASS THIS WARNING ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW -- DON'T DO IT NOW !!!!!

Subject: How to include text from 'fortune'?

I was wondering if it was possible to append output from the Unix
'fortune' command at the end of every mail message sent out from my

Thanks.

For an example (now slightly better documented) of lots of scoring
rules applied at once in perl, see my version of Johnbob's jmdigest.
His is availible at <URL:http://www.io.com/~johnbob/jm/>. My stuff
is availible at <URL:ftp://ftp.netusa.net/users/eli/jmdigest>
and <URL:ftp://ftp.netusa.net/users/eli/jmdrc>. It has a large
number of header checks and a very large collection of 'scam'
regular expressions.

It can be used from a procmailrc but I am still working out a
sample recipe for it.

Sample of my jmdigest RE scam checks applied to subject and body.
Each one of these ups the score by one. (I generally use a cutoff
value of 3, YMMV.) Long lines folded at 75 columns.

# Try to catch any price followed by an additional price for postage.
+/\b(\$\s*\d+.*){2}(p(ost(age)?)?(\s*(and|\+|\&)\s*h(andling)?)?|ship)/i

# Match such constructs as "You can change your life if you take five
# minutes to read this" or "5 minutes to read this and it could change
# your life". Note that order of phrases is not important. Will also
# catch weird stuff like "Read this now read this now read this now".
+/(((5|five)\s+minutes|read\s+this|change\s+your\s+life)\b(\s*\S+\s+){0,3}
){3}/i

# Next two catch many of the 'free' cd-rom offers.
+/\bfree\s+(nude\s+)?(adult|teen|xxx|celebrit(y|ies)|gay)s?\s+cd[-\s]*r[o0
]m/i
+/\b(nude\s+)?(adult|teen|xxx|celebrit(y|ies)|gay)s?\s+free\s+cd[-\s]*r[o0
]m/i

# From "free usage at our homepage" to "free admittence to the website"
+/\bfree\s+(entrance|admit+[ea]nce|access|usage)\s+(at|to)\s+(our|the)\s+(
(web)?site|(home|web)?page)/i

my jmdigest is under constant refinement for better aim.

Another useful method is to use scoring.  Have procmail score your mail 
based upon it meeting certian criteria that is common to lots of spam.  
Some examples are:

Dollar signs in the subject
Hair loss comments.
making money
Lots of urls.

Your milage may vary.
