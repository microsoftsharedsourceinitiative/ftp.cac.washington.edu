That's because VI is a very powerful TEXT editor and can do a lot more
than PICO.  VI can search and replace all instances in a text.  VI can
import unix shell output (e.g. :r !ls -FL) text onto its message body.
EMACS is comparable to VI.

Could you give me some direction how to get news from e-mail.I tried to
set the news file in the way it is said in "Help" section,but failed.
And I can not get what does  "[Can't change sys-admin defined value]".
What should I do if this phrase appears?

For the past two months I have been having a problem with the reminder for
moving the previous month's sent mail to the sent-mail-april folder even
after I have done this procedure on the initial logon.  This happened
through the entire month of April and now is continuing in May.  How do I
get it to stop sending me the reminder? 

Also when I typed "B" to report this bug I was unable to get out that
screen.  I had to suspend Pine with ^Z and then kill the job.

I am runnig Pine 3.93 on an IBM R6000.  

Best wishes

 Tom

Thanks for all your reply. I know how to it in script. I was wondering
if this should be another feature in the feature release of all mail
programs. The mail programs should provide ways to encrypt folds or
mails to make it a Pretty Good Mail  :-)

I've been having a problem with the new month folder moving feature 
where it prompts me each time I start up pine to move sent-mail
to x-month-sent-mail

How can I get it to stop this, ie not disable the feature, but let it ask
just once at the beginning of each month?


Thanks

Subject: Can Pine notify web site of incoming e-mail ?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I wonder if anyone knows whether you can set up Pine so that it
automatically notifies a web site of incoming e-mail messages.

Seiko Message Watch have a web site where they can page me automatically if
I enter a specific URL designation.  I wonder whether Pine can be setup
such that the URL will be "hit" everytime I receive an incomng e-mail.

If anyone has any ideas I would be very grateful.

There is no way you can find all email addresses.
And it would not be a good idea, either.  RTFFAQ!

I suggest you contact your friend the usual way
(ie phone, letter) and ask him for his address.

Some people prefer power over ease-of-use.  I use both pico or vi
depending on the circumstance.

So far, so good.

Bzzzt...wrong.  Thank you for playing.  pico is the pencil.  vi is a
drafting set.  emacs is an engineering firm and artists colony rolled into
one.

vi and emacs are only comparable in the sense that comparisons can be made
between them.  But you can make comparisons between virtually any two
editors, so that's not what you meant.  You meant that they have similar
functionality.  That is way, way, way off.

My mistake.  The extent of use I've seen with EMACS was simply used as a
text editor for programming.  I stand corrected. :)

Well, now, since you seem to be in the mood for yet another boring holy war,
let's lay out sensible rules first:

1. There is no such thing as vi.
2. There is no such thing as emacs.

How's that?

Well, there's vi, vim, viper, elvis... And there's emacs, XEmacs, jemacs,
microemacs, jove...

  >vi and emacs are only comparable in the sense that comparisons can be
  >made between them. But you can make comparisons between virtually any two

As for the value of comparisons in general: IMAO, you can compare anything,
but most of these comparisons aren't very fruitful (being a political
scientist, I may draw your attention to the heated debates that arose over
the theory of totalitarianism vs. theories of fascism...).
Therefore, while you may well compare, say, vi to jove, comparing vi to
XEmacs certainly doesn't make much sense.

Yet, since almost anyone these days owns a computer that launches even emacs
within 1--2 seconds, the comparison might yet be sensible because emacs has
some very sensible features which pine in general and even with pico as its
alternate editor lacks. Compare pine to gnus and you'll find that is is
inferior in almost any respect. But then again, who needs all those
features?

Therefore, I'd suggest burying this thread, if I may, because it's been all
over the net for years, and there doesn't seem to be a solution.

And just how should it even begin to do that? Pine is an email program...

There are some kluges I could think of, all of them involving cron jobs
that somehow monitor your inbox (time-stamp would be an idea, like asmail or
xbiff) and upon alteration launch lynx and kill it immediately.

You could, of course, also abuse procmail for this purpose, but I couldn't
figure out how to assign a terminal to lynx right now :-)

I agree mostly.  In each case there is "one true" one and many variants.
(And I'm not saying that the variant is in someway lacking since I use
variants in each case.)  But referring to "something that descended from
and/or remains somewahat similar to vi" simply as "vi" seems to be an
appropriate and wise expedient.

I need those features.  Something that was smarter about justification of
quoted blocks would save me ten minutes per week.  Having an addressbook
that has better functionality built in would save me more time than that.
The beauty of pine is that these features can be added, but off-by-default
for those users that don't want them.  To be honest, I'd like to see us
embed perl (or some lisp) in pine with lots of hooks that would allow
functions to be called for certain events.  This would make having a
personal signature generator easier.  In fact, building a pine-compatible
email program in perl might be a good thing.  Pine provides a very good
user interface and is very stable, but "culturally" it encourages
minimalism while supporting a number of "expert" features.  Hmmmm....
perl needs some more free "applications".  :-)

As it relates to the future of pine I don't intend to "bury" it.  As it
relates to editor religion, I have no intention of continuing given that
my original point about the incomparability of emacs and vi has been
thoroughly made.

How do I make pine include a reply-to line in the header of outgoing mail?

By doing what we all did when we didn't know pine --- reading the docu?


customized-hdrs 
   
   Add these custom headers when composing. Also possible to add default
values to these custom headers or to any of the standard headers. This is a
list variable. Each entry in the list is a header name (the actual header
name that will appear in the message) followed by an optional colon and
value. For example, if a Reply-to header was needed because it was different
from the From address, that could be accomplished with:
          
customized-hdrs=Reply-to: fred_flintstone@bedrock.net

Hello. 

I am new at using pine, and I really want to know if there is any way to
download my incoming messages (all together) into a file that I can open
with Microsoft word. 

I have searched forever for a 'capture' or 'download' command, but I'm
lost. Can anyone help? 

Thanks!

Yes, but there are a couple of things you need to specify first:

1. You seem to working on BSDi, so: Are you familiar with ftp? Can your
   windows do it?

2. Have you set a path for your read messages in the setup? If so, you can
   use this file. If not, you need to check where your inbox is and use that
   file.
   
3. Are you aware of the fact that email messages look kinda strange? You
   should consider piping the file through printmail before raping it with
   word. (This won't work with the procedure I'm suggesting below)

4. Why on earth do you want to "postprocess" *giggle* your email messages
   with word?

While 1-3 are somewhat essential, 4 is not that important :-)

  >I have searched forever for a 'capture' or 'download' command, but I'm
  >lost.

Oh yeah? Although I do like "capture", try saying something like this next
time...

	grep -i download Read_Me/Pine-docu/*

which will tell you this...

	download-command
This option affects the behavior of the Export command. It specifies a Unix
program name, and any necessary command line arguments, that Pine can use to
transfer the exported message to your personal computer's disk.

	download-command-prefix 
This option is used in conjunction with the Download-command option. It
defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via standard output)
immediately prior to starting the download command. This is useful for
integrated serial line file transfer agents that permit command passing
(e.g., Kermit's APC method).
                    
  
I didn't bother trying what those do, but I could imagine that using this in
connection with the aggregate-command stuff might also lead to a result.
Which result exactly, I cannot say...

[1 minute later...]
Yup, that's what you want. Enable aggregate-command in the setup, too, then
say:

	;      a          a     e

i.e.:	select select All Apply Export

Now, you need to tweak the download commands according to your needs and
you're there.


  >kguida@freedomhouse.org
Is that your reply-to address? Then you should put it in the header...

What's wrong with that? Personally, I found "growing up" with pine quite
refreshing. I found that it doesn't cover all of my needs anymore, so I
might move to Gnus in the end, but I like the idea of having a program that
is foolproof in vanilla-mode but quite powerful when modified.

Let's put it this way: If it wasn't for its poor yanking, pico would cover
99% of everybody's needs as an editor in pine. 

And there's this, too:

	109448 Dec 20  1995 /usr/bin/pico*
	172716 Aug 10  1995 /usr/bin/joe* (or jpico...)
	315772 Oct 22  1996 /usr/bin/vim*

Yes I can.  Bud I'd rather say it in perl so it wouldn't sound so overly

It is quite powerful, but it lacks the flexibility and easy modifiability
of something like gnus or a perl-based MUA.

But showing off is so fun and can be quite useful.

The other 1% are those of who are supporting the other 99%.  The 1% are
the ones who have to install this stuff.  If you can make the 1% happier
and not annoyt the 99% much then you'll have a more popular product.

And the perl binary itself is probably on the same size as emacs.  That's
life.  Big doesn't have to be unfriendly.

I've been sending lists using BCC for a long time now, and it works just
fine -- so long as I put something in the to line (an appropriate alias
with my address), every one the mail, but not the list of addresses.

Does the new "lcc:" improve on this procedure in any way?  All comments
appreciated.

Definately, agreed!  Once you're used to vi, you'll never go back
to pico.  Pico is great for non-UNIX-geeks, but is extraordinarily
primative in terms of its capabilities.  Ever try to do something
moderately complicated, say, take a UNIX /etc/passwd file, and strip
out everything but the list of usernames (i.e. delete everything after
the first ':' in each line) in pico?  You'd have to go through each
line individually...with vi (or sed), it's one simple regular expression,
that's maybe ten or fewer characters long.

Have you tried:

Subject: mapping menus to different keys?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Is there any way to map menu keys to those I prefer? I find it very
inconsistent to navigate across folder lists/email lists/etc. by
using different keys depending on where you are.

I like the way tin newsreader or lynx web browser uses, for example,
where the same keys are used for entering/exiting a list or a message
or a link, especially structuring everything as a hierarchy where you
move up and down the level.

pine seems to not structure things the same way. You have to know
where you want to specifically go, such as 'M' for main menu, 'L'
for folder list (except for 'E' to exit help), etc.

I rather have left arrow key to get where I was before, and right
arrow to get into a selected item, no matter what the item is or
what item I'm looking at.

Truth is, you really don't want Pine to remember your password. It would pose
a serious security threat, since someone could use your saved password to gain
access to the remote machine, and maybe exhibit nasty behaviour with your
userid.

As for SMTP, I'm not sure you even need to enter your password for this, but
then I have sendmail handle outgoing mail on my machine...

If you really don't want to have to type in your password to get your mail,
consider a package like fetchmail, or some such, but as always, be aware of
the security implications...

Would you put something there about making pine multi-threaded so it

This is a bug which should be gone once and for all in Pine 4.00.  The
most common cause is NULs in messages; Pine 3.xx is not NUL-safe.

The error message occurs when the calculated header + text size is less
than the reported "full RFC 822 size".  The lower levels (imap-3.6
toolkit) know the true size of the data, but Pine's upper levels has no
way to find it out other than by strlen() which terminates on NULs. 

We are trying to make Pine 4.00 fully NUL-safe and eliminate strlen() 
calls.  As of the imap-4 tookit, the lower levels pass up the true size of
the data to the upper levels.  Pine 4.00 uses the imap-4.1 tookit.

Regrettably, it is not possible to build Pine 3.9x with the imap-4.1
toolkit; you'll have to wait for Pine 4.00 to come out.  We're working on
it as fast as we can!

Good but not very flexible. Probably better: Check if you have metamail (you
probably will). Have a look at the mailcap file (should be /etc/mailcap) and
add a line like: 

     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------
# the test line specifies that this viewer should only be used if
# the display variable is set.
image/jpeg; xv %s;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# The following sends all other image subtypes to xloadimage
image/*; xloadimage %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"
     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------

That in itself isn't all that superior to Bussiga's solution, but there
should be some explanatory notes on further uses in connection with image
viewers in the mailcap file. Take for instance a situation in which Notscape
is already running. You could check for this and save yourself the time of
starting a new viewer. You could also take a CLI jpeg--viewer and launch X
viewers only for other images. Blablabla... ;-)

HTH,
Robin

Subject: Changing the From: field
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm sorry for the (maybe) FAQ but I've been 10 days looking for the answer
without finding anything!

I'm using pine 3.91 and I'm tryng to change the From: address but I cannot,
I can only change the domain part of my email, not the user id. I've tried
customizing the From: header but pine tells me it's impossible... d'u have
some clue on how to do it? Or do I have to use the reply-to?

TIA and sorry for the FAQ,

Andrea

Much in the way that a Jaguar XK8 is comparable to a Gremlin - they're
both cars.

I disagree.  When I'm writing e-mail, I want all of the word
processing frills, like word wrap, easy navigation (w/o having to
switch modes), etc.  For that, I used Pico.

When I need an editor for quick-and-dirty shell-script editing, or
something similar, I use vi.  Vi is better IMHO for editing when
appearance doesn't count.

When I'm doing real coding, I use XEmacs.

It's all a matter of using the right tool for the right job...

Just as soon as you rewrite it in lisp. =)

BBDB stands for the Insidious Big Brother Database, a wonderful
package that functions as sort of a rolodex on steroids.  It has all
of the functionality of the Pine addressbook, but it also supports
user-defined fields, it can automagically build database entries by
scanning your mail messages, and it can (with Gnus, don't know about
other mailers), tag messages from people for whom you have BBDB entries.

Which is why I do so love the lisp subdirectory (or site-lisp) found
in *Emacs installations.

I fully agree. XEmacs rules, Gnus's better than pine. Objections anyone?
But can you use Gnus on your CLI without refcard? Would you give it to an
inexperienced user? =8-} Would you moderate the mailing list for it?

However, I still cannot quite see where this thread is leading to. While in
general, I share your views on expandability and customization, I think that
you're aiming at the wrong target. IMAO, a user that needs the features
you're asking for doesn't need pine anymore, but is better off using Gnus
instead, anyway. 

I mean, the spirit of u*ix (correct me if I'm wrong again) is to combine
several tools to achieve various goals: in this sense, I don't see XEmacs as
an editor, but rather as an environment for basically everything I need for
my work (programming, email, news, www, making coffee [does anyone remember
the name of that .el which lets you hook up electric gadgets?). 

You seem to be thinking along the same lines, so your suggestions might miss
the target, because pine is a specialised tool. Its purpose is emails and
news, not a full-fledged database (BBDB), filtering (procmail), fancy
yanking (supercite), or even encryption (those filter-scripts are nice, but
mailcrypt is ultimately better).

All _I_ want is better yanking in pico, and maybe pgp within pine (which
cannot be done for reasons of US legislation). If you could come up with a
Deluxe version of pine that turns into a pizza with a large Coke at
midnight, everybody would love you.

So here we are, deploring the world's injustice, dreaming of a better world
in which Alphas come at $500 and everyone has a 300MB Ramdisk... *sigh* I
guess it's one of those lonely Saturday evenings... >:->

Have a nice weekend,
Robin

Hy there!

I'm new in this section and would like to know from any "prof" if there
is
any possibility to:
	* copy incoming mails and redirect this copies to an other eMail 		   	
address (home-address), as a background task...
	* send the complete INBOX as one eMail/File to an other eMail	
		address (home-address), eg. twice a day.
	  (even if one is not logged on)
Are there any programs who do this? Any hints, suggestions are very
welcome!!!

Thanx!

Antony

Suggestion:

try

man forward

This should be able to do the closest thing you're looking for. Also, as 
far as sending an INBOX, find out where the inbox is stored..like 
/var/mail/username or something, and read

man at

or 

man cron

and tell at or cron <whichever> to send the file at a certain time by 
doing this:

cat mailfile | mail recipient@host.dom

You might use cron. It's easier. You use the crontab command. If you use 
at, type

at time1 'cat mailfile | mail user;at time1 cat mailfile | mail user'
at time2 'cat mailfile | mail user;at time2 cat mailfile | mail user'

the second at is to tell at to run the command again, as once it runs it, 
it'll just forget it.

cron on the other hand remembers...but some systems won't let normal 
users use cron... :)

hope this helps.

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

I would like to extend my utmost apologies for any inconvenience,
insult or offence I may have caused to the users of this newsgroup
by my posting of Big Bucks 2 on May 3, 1997.

I am a new user to the newsgroups and did not realize that 
I was doing anything wrong.

Again I apologize for this matter.

C. Blackmore.

Several quick questions.

(1)  In MAILCAP.SAM there are two examples for specifying an application to 
process a MIME attachment.  Is the semicolon, ";". a part of the syntax?  Or, 
is it there to have the remainder of the line treated as a comment?

(2)  If there is an entry in MAILCAP for a specific MIME type, does there need 
to be a corresponding entry in MIMETYPE?

(3)  If MAILCAP exists, must MIMETYPE also exist?

As a long time user of pine, I'm familiar with messages that pine spits
out, like these:

Move current "sent-mail" to "sent-mail-apr-1997"?

and

Move current "read-messages" to "read-messages-apr-1997"?

My current problem is that I can't get these to stop coming up.  I've
never had a use for this "feature" anyway, but I've ingored it in the past
because it only came up once a month.  Is there anyway I can turn it off,
now that it's decided to ask me every single last time?

Use your favourite editor to edit pinerc (setup config cannot do the
following).

Look for the line

last-time-prune-questioned=97.5
(the last numbers will be the last year and month)

Set the final number to something very large (i have 999.99), eg:

last-time-prune-questioned=999.99

You will never see the messages again....!

HI!!!
I have just found out that it is possible to take info from INTERNET via
Email. However, I do not know whether it is possible to access sound,
picture, actions, etc. or not.
Do you have any idea about that? REPLY!!!
By the way send http, ftp addresses(cool stuff!).

Can anybody who is using Windows95 to access Pine (via Telnet, of course)
please get in touch with me!  I'm finding it impossible to print messages
and wondering at this point if it's even possible to print using Win95...

Thanks alot!

I would do so if I didn't have to read all posts in all newsgroups
so I catch someone suggesting it in some subthread.  ;-)
Read:  Send me an email about it and I'll see about adding it.

control codes that are passed when you "print-from-ansi".  You need a
different emulator.  Here are two I suggest, both free, and work great:

http://www.lysator.liu.se/~zander/ewan.html	EWAN Terminal Emulator
Not much of a looker, but a great, dependable product. (I'm using it now!)

http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html		HyperTerminal Upgrade
This company wrote the HyperTerminal applet that shipped with Win95, but
as it stands, it doesn't support Telnet.  This upgrade does, and has some
other cool enhancements. It's called the HyperTerminal Private Edition.

*Both* of the above support printer control codes and print great.  My
preference is for the HyperTerminal upgrade.  I find it easier to format
the page for printing, and you can set margins, etc. (much like a word
processor).  But, try 'em both out.  Both downloads are less than 1 meg, I
believe, and both are good products for different reasons.  Try and
decide.

Hope this helps!  Regards,

You don't mind giving his address, do you?
And before you post a snail mail address - this is
an electronic medium, so give an email address, ok?!

Yes, I have changed the Subject: line - hopefully showing
that this is possible and also that the body of a request
should state what the request is all about.

HTH.

Greg --

Been there. Done that.  Works OK.  Right now, I am telnetted to my email
system (via EWAN).  I can print locally or to a system printer.

Also, I have the 32-bit version of PINE operational -- can do printing to
both locally attached and system printers.

You can contact me via email or land line (630 844 5290).

I'm being forced to do that, and I don't mind, because I need more features
than pico offers.

Granted, joe's almost twice as big as pico, but it has the features I need,
while IMNSHO maintaining all of pico's ease of use.

Granted, too, that vim is *much* better than joe, but I find it utterly
cryptic, even compared to emacs (ymmv). It's just not something I would give
to inexperienced users, unless they had touched my computer. >:->

However, there is a middle ground between "simple" (one might say
patronizingly primitive) and "complicated" a.k.a. badly documented. Joe has
a nice help screen that could be customized for pine to reflect all features
that are currently available in pico. Furthermore, when run in jpico mode,
there are no differences between joe and pico as far as keyboard shortcuts
are concerned. Now, if you wanted more features than offered initially, you
could still use them, because they would be explained in additional and
easily accessible help screens. Simply put: ^J remains ^J, but now does
proper yanking of this:

Not too bad, right?

If you want to use any flavour of emacs, you have to have been born with
these abilities. BTW, comp.religion alone will do. Emacs is, after all, the
editor of gods. =8-}

Yes, it's possible. No, this is not the right forum for your request. And
NO!!!, it's not polite to use aol (c) style syntax in a serious discussion
group. Had you read the netiquette, you'd know that...

  >By the way send http, ftp addresses(cool stuff!).

Definitly not, and the same goes true for all the other freenet.uz guys out
there. Just because you've been given pine as your email program doesn't
mean that you can spew your requests into this mailing list. It's being read
by quite a few people out there, and many of them get a *lot* of emails a
day. Unrelated, irrelevant and generally meaningless mails like yours here
cause a lot of distress among those people who want to actually help others
with, in this case, pine.

Cheers,
Robin

Anyone know why I'm getting this error in syslog?

May  5 10:59:00 loompa.ns.itd.umich.edu sendmail[20396]: KAA20396:

It only happens when using pine.

To whom it may concern,
	Today was the worst day of my life. For the first time in months I
was expecting to hear from my brother, who lives in the Caribbean, by
E-Mail. Back there it is so costly that he can only afford to login once a
week. In any event, I was unable to get his letter because not only did I
have to login twice, I also lost ALL my messages. On my first login this
so-called new wave of technology stated that I had mail and after telling
me that it could not connect me to PINE; upon logging in for the umpteenth
time, to my utter dismay, "0 Messages" appeared at the top of my screen. 
	I am regretting ever succumbing to this piece of rubbish. I should
have gone with my every instinct and supported the USPS by buying a stamp
in the first place. 
"New wave of technology my FOOT!!!!"

Yours most angrily,
Disappointed user.

Due to negligence, Fayola C. Trim let this slip into my inbox of terror on
Setting Orange, the 52nd day of Discord in the YOLD 3163:

  >	Today was the worst day of my life. 

So you thought you needed a lot of people share your self-afflicted anger?
Get a life... Your mail was insultive, utterly meaningless and didn't
apparently have *any*thing to do with pine whatsoever...

[snipped some ridiculous nonsense about some third world island]  

  >In any event, I was unable to get his letter because not only did I have

Why? Doesn't happen unless enforced by user [you]

Why? Either it's there or it isn't. If it isn't there it isn't there. So
it's not a pine problem you're whining about.

  >upon logging in for the umpteenth time, 
  
Why?  c.f. above... [you]
  
  >to my utter dismay, "0 Messages" appeared at the top of my screen.

Impossible, unless you manually deleted them [you]

  >	I am regretting ever succumbing to this piece of rubbish. 

Did anyone force you to do that? Don't think so... [you]

  >I should have gone with my every instinct and supported the USPS by
  >buying a stamp in the first place.

No. Should have taken your mouse chord and hung yourself. As an alternative,
you might consider learning the basics of using a computer. All the symptoms
you described can be traced back to *utter*, *total*, *criminal* ignorance
on your behalf. 

How about this: Get a gun, shoot yourself and try whining that it didn't
tell you bullets are lethal afterwards. A computer is a tool, not a toy
(though MS sometimes leads one to believe people wish it were).
  
  >"New wave of technology my FOOT!!!!"

Why don't you do it yourself? Can you not even do that on your own?

  >Yours most angrily,

Whiner.  
  
  >Disappointed user.

Luser. You're running pine on a local SGI --- anyone important enough to
gain access to such a machine should have enough common sense to Read The F*
Manual before he starts insulting people that devote their time and energy
to offer a marvellous little program for free.

	    Free Software: Contribute nothing, expect nothing

Write a better mailer (if you can use it, it can be considered idiot--proof)
and make the world a lot happier. Otherwise go [censored] yourself.

Cheers,
Robin

Has anyone compiled PC-Pine for WindowsNT on the DEC Alpha platform?

If so, I'd appreciate to get a copy of the executable.
If not, I'd be willing to try. Is the source code publicly available? 
(It wasn't in the PC-Pine for Win32 package.)

Data for email has to be encoded and decoded - you don't want that.
If you want WWW then get a WWW browser and install it.
And please give your messages a meaningful Subject: line -
"Untitled" is not very descriptive.

Ok, let's see... You probably mean upload from your account or download to
your local system, not ftp'ing files you've exported to your remote home
dir, right? Then this should help:

     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------
   download-command

This option affects the behavior of the Export command. It specifies a Unix
program name, and any necessary command line arguments, that Pine can use to
transfer the exported message to your personal computer's disk.

   download-command-prefix

This option is used in conjunction with the Download-command option. It
defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via standard output)
immediately prior to starting the download command. This is useful for
integrated serial line file transfer agents that permit command passing
(e.g., Kermit's APC method).
     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------

If that doesn't help, come back with the tech-spex of your two systems, that
might make helping you a little easier .-)

Later,
Robin

Dear Pine experts,

	I run a network of DEC 3000's running DU v4.0.  My users have
had persistent problems with Pine, which frequently spends 10 minutes
or more trying to write "Fcc".  It appears that the problem has to do
with file locking as I get many lock files created in a very short
interval of time in affected user directories relative to "sent-mail"
and "interrupted-mail" (the latter probably due to frustrated users).
The user directories are NFS-distributed (this is a college);
/var/spool/mail is NOT NFS-distributed.

	Call #1 to DEC Support (late February) revealed a patch for
lockd in version 4.0 .  I installed it; the problem persists and in
fact is now getting worse.  In desperation I called again; DEC Support
suggested that pine and procmail (which was installed very recently)
should have lockf locking enabled to handle NFS (I'm not an expert on
file locking mechanisms and I wouldn't have trusted myself to choose
one).  procmail seems to be doing this anyways, but I reconfigured to
force lockf: no help.  For the life of me, I can't find any way to
configure Pine to use lockf or indeed any particular locking
mechanism.  We are using Pine v3.96.

	Any suggestions?  Am I barking up the wrong tree?  Can Pine be
made to use lockf?  Help, my mail box was loaded with student
complaints this morning!

						Larry

I'm new to Unix, but if you have access to the mail file. Rename the
file on your server. Rename on target computer, FTP to yourself, rename
back to mail. Would that not count as untracable EMAIL forwarding??

If the above worked. You could always cut out what you wanted and put
the file back. Let me know if this works or not.

    Have you tried it?  If not, why are you asking before trying it

    Not that I have ever heard of, but there may be things others know

    The rest is a little academic.  However, this seems like the long
way around to filter incoming mail.  You posted with tin, so I am
presuming that you are talking about Pine running under a flavor of
Un*x.  In that case, there are specialized tools, such as procmail and
filter, which will do just what you want without a lot of gyrations
Pine may not even be able to perform.  After all, sorting incoming mail
is part of the mail delivery process, and Pine is not designed or
intended to be part of that process.  procmail and filter, however,
are.

Does anyone know if there is a Windows 95 vi or vi clone that has
something analagous to pico's ^J to justify an already-written
paragraph?  I know that in Unix vi you can send a paragraph through
fmt but I'm wondering how to do this type of thing in the Windows
95 world.

Thanks much,
Nancy

The guidelines that people just gave should work for Berkeley
format mail folders BUT there are many folder formats that include
information about the size of each message.  If your folder is in
one of these formats then editing the subject will trash the folder
(unless your new subject happens to be the same size as the old
subject).  Note that the PC-Pine folder format includes info on
message size. 

Good luck,
Nancy

Sure. Quit using an outdated version of Netrape and Dos95 or write to one of
their lists, then get yourself a cope of uudecode from yahoo
<http://www.yahoo.com>, say uudecode <file>, kick the file into a fitting
application (.doc to Word or something), done.

Later,
Robin

Hi,
   I have recently logged onto a unix server at uni. It is running pine
3.93 under unix (ibm) and i am not recieving mail. I have tried sending
mail to my account from my home address and it just isn't getting through.
I can however send mail from pine. Does anyone have any ideas as to why
this is happening.

Thanx in advance.
Mel

Hi folks -- 

Every night pine 3.96 dumps core at 00:45.  I cannot figure out
what is causing it --

Could my cron that cleans /tmp be causing the problem?

mario@panther:/duac/home/mario> gdb -c core

Core was generated by `/duac/home/mario/bin/pine'.
Program terminated with signal 6, Aborted.
#0  0xef674340 in ?? ()

I would do more debugging, but I am not a guru at gdb.

My question really is -- who is sending the signal 6, Abort?

pine itself?

Anyway -- thanks.

		Mario

Melissa:

If you get this message :) the best place to start asking questions is
with your school's help desk or system administrator.  There are several
things or reasons that could account for this, and as far as *we* can see,
Pine is working fine.  I'd ask them if everything is configured right on
your system, if you're using the right address, and detail the problems
you're having to them.

That's probably your best bet to start off with.

Good luck,

Voodoo? Hehehe...

Unless pine doesn't lock its files properly: no.

...however ... >:-> 

Pruning /tmp with a cron job might not be the best of ideas, anyway. Either
do it manually, or do it on startup. Properly programmed apps clean their
tmp files, anyway. Since it it's "your" cron job (i.e. you're the
supervisor), you might as well consider using a local tmp file.

Furthermore, you'd best use LSEW (low space early warning) in your cron job,
thereby rendering the cron prune superfluous. After all, it really doesn't
matter how big your /tmp dir is, as long as it doesn't affect the system
performance.

Amen,
Robin

Hi:

Is there any way to re-open the INBOX after another pine process was
started? I understand that the default is for the Mailbox lock to be
owned by the latest process. If that process no longer exists, can an
earlier process regain the lock?

I'm not sure if pine-info is a mailing list, hence please send replies
to sameer@qualcomm.com.

TIA
Sameer

PC Pine-32 under NT Workstation 4.0, using PMDF IMAP server on VAX/VMS
system, when sending mail, says it's writing fcc to NEWMAIL folder, but it
doesn't ever get there!

Also, when adding a new folder in the Folder List screen, it appears, but
no message is inside. Previously, I remember that it would put the
standard IMAP placeholder message there.

Any ideas?

To answer one's own question may help other's in the case below. Found in
the file .pinerc a setting concerning the pruning of the sent-mail and it
was set to 97-4, so every time I entered pine it tried to save sent-mail 
in another location. Permissions on the .pinerc would not allow me, as a
ordinary user to edit file. Make sure that the .pinerc file is owned by
you so that you can enter setup and make necessary and usefull changes.
Luckily having su I could correct error in permissions otherwise would
have to contact my sysadm ..... Hope this helps anyone with same
condition.

Hi there,

Correct me if I'm wrong, but is there really no way to move through folder
collections via the tab key? If so, is there any reason for that? I use a
primitive means of checking whether new mail has arrived from certain lists
(i.e. procmail them into an own folder-collection and delete afterwards to
see if new mail has arrived in any of them), but the "feature" of jumping to
the last unread message in that folder doesn't make moving there any easier
.-)

I'd be grateful if anyone could come up with a hint what to do.

TIA,
Robin

I usually read my mail with Pine.  However, the other day, I accidentally
clicked the mailbox icon in Netscape and my my >200 messages were read by
Netscape.  Is there any easy way I could get read those messages in Pine
again?  Thanks for any help.

Ok,if I have mail from q230948@host.onramp.com, I obviously
want something easier to remember. Maybe John.

Pine lets me do this. I can set up a nickname for john, and
it will fill the ithe address with John's real address.

And I can set it up so that any outgoing mail to John goes
into FCC folder john.

But how to I get incoming mail from q230948 when I hit s to save
to go to John?

I am really unhappy to get a mail from s.b., who repeats his mail several
times a day (automatically ?) .

Is there any possibility to say to the system, that I don't want to get
mails from certain persons?

Kind regards

We are using Pine 3.91 on SunOS4.1.3
I am trying to set up a folder to be used as a bulletin board for all 
our staff to read.
I have set up the message as a file named 1 in directory 
/home/var/spool/news/staff readonly by anyone, and I can read this
successfully as an additional incoming folder, but obviously can't delete
or eXpunge it, as it is read only, so I get it every pine session.
When I precede the folder name with a * to indicate treat it as a bulletin
board I get the message Can't open mailbox, no such bboard

I have also tried to set this up as a local news collection.
news-collections=*[]
news-spool-dir=/home/var/spool/news
I have a file /usr/lib/news/active which lists /home/var/spool/news/staff
When I try to read the news with this setup, I get an empty list 
message, and have no lists to subscribe to.
I have searched through the context-sensitive help, the technical guide,
the Faq, etc., and can't find anything else to do.
Please can anyone tell me what I have missed, or done wrong.
Thanks.

Please,

mails that are within the folders of the pine in Eudora (since it only
picks the ones in the inbox and ignore the rest).
	Thanks a lot.k

    Then it would need to be a user option.  I detest horizontal
scrolling about as much as I detest the clods who write overlength
lines in the first place.  (A lot of them are probably using kiddy 
toys like Nut$crape and don't even realize what they're doing.)

Three things to do.

1. Try to talk to that person.

2. Talk to his postmaster if that fails, so he can void the account.

3. Use a filtering system to get rid of the mail and, possibly, retaliate.
   A good system is procmail. Check Nancy McGough's filtering faq for
   further info.

Later,

When reading newsgrps in Pine, is it possible to configure it
so that it will group replies into one area, such as 'tin' does?

As it is currently, I can't seem to get it to do this.

Thanks

Hi,

I'm sending 8-bit ASCII file (KOI-8 chatacters) with PINE 3.96 and do not
want text to be encoded. I have all features like "8-bit .." enable and
inclide ASCII text in a mail body using ^R command. Everything is ok
for rather small messages, I do not have any encoding and everything is ok.
But when I send rather large text, PINE automatically BASE64 encode it.
Can I avaid such an encoding? Thanks.    

                                   Vladimir

Hopefully, someone will know the answer to the following problems:

A bunch of us here at work are using Pine (v3.95) on SunOS 4.1.4.
Other people here at work are using Microsoft Exchange for their
email.

When people on Microsoft Exchange send email to us Pine users,
we get this WINMAIL.DAT uudecoded text at the bottom of each
email. Also a server id is embedded in the email address in
the "From:" field in the header.

We Pine users cannot respond directly to these Microsoft Exchange
users because the email bounces unless we remove the server id.

For example, if I was a Microsoft Exchange user, my id would
appear as follows to Pine users:

   sf3@po1.ElSegundoCa.NCR.COM
       ^^^

The "po1" is some sort of server id.

Yet another group of people use Sun's "mailtool" for their email.
Users of "mailtool" do not get the WINMAIL.DAT text at the bottom
of their emails, nor do they get the server id in the header and
they *can* respond directly to the email.

Questions:

1) Is there a way to suppress the inclusion of the WINMAIL.DAT
   text at the bottom of the email?

2) Is there a reason why the server id is being embedded in the
   email address?

3) Is there a way to respond to Microsoft Exchange users without
   having to edit the email address everytime?

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!!

Subject: PC-Pine Deletes Temporary File Before Spawning Viewer Application
Content-Type: Text/Plain; charset=US-ASCII
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Under Windows95, PC-Pine will spawn a viewer application for an attachment if a 
MAILCAP file is defined.  This seems to work correctly when the sample MAILCAP 
file is used and the attachment is MIME type, Application/msword.  (Well, it 
works if you overlook the fact that Word for Windows 6.0 can't open a file in 
the IM-123456.xxx format used for temporary files.)

If you add another MIME type such as Application/WordPerfect5.1,  PC-Pine does 
decode the Base64 attachment.  It creates the temporary file.  It spawns the 
designated application but unfortunately deletes the file before the 
application can open the file.

Is there any way to prevent this from happening?  Application/MSWORD files are 
for some reason not deleted.

Subject: PC-Pine Creates Temporary Files witn Long File Names
Content-Type: Text/Plain; charset=US-ASCII
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

On a Windows95 system, PC-Pine creates temporary files with long file names 
like IM-123456.xxx where xxx is the file extension defined for the MIME type.  
The principal problem with this is that older Windows 3.x applications that can 
run under Windows95 cannot open the temporary file.

Is there a configuration option that forces PC-Pine to generate 8.3 file names 
that can be opened by all applications that can run under Windows95?

Yup. Sendmail can do this. qmail can do it even better. 

All you need is a .qmail (with qmail) which contains
/home/user
mail@another.user

I would omit the sending of the complete INBOX, but instead
forward it.

Hello! A rookie's question. I would like sometimes to print my composition 
for proofreading or consultation before sending but there seems to be no
command for this in PINE. Is it possible? Thanks in advance. Bob Allan

Subject: E-mail paging in UK
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hi,
I don't know if this is the correct newsgroup, but does anyone know of a company in the UK,
that I can get to page me when I send an e-mail there. I am sysadmin of a server, and a friend
has set up his server to check if mine is down. If it goes down, then he is paged. However,
he lives in America. I would like for his computer to e-mail a company that would page me here
in the UK. I have a British Telecom pager. I would be very grateful if anyone could either
give me some info, or point me to the correct place to post. Apologies in advance for
cross-topic postings.
TIA,
-Aled Treharne

What's your point concerning pine?  That is not an editor.

 >(yes, they're all stripped)

Are they all dynamically linked?  (still beside the point)

So you are comparing an MUA to an editor that includes a complete
implementation of lisp.  What does that have to do with the size of joe or
pico or vi?  On my SPARC running Solaris 2.5.1, here are the sizes of some
editors:

-r-xr-xr-x   5 bin      bin       236328 May  3  1996 /bin/vi
-rwxr-xr-x   5 root     faculty   221008 Jul 11  1995 joe2.8
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     faculty   676312 Jul  6  1995 jove
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     other     176536 Jul  6  1995 pico

vi and joe are stripped, while jove and pico are not.

 >Given the extra functionality you get with xemacs (ignoring the 16M
 >lisp directory), I'd say they were pretty well matched.

Neither joe nor jove requires any external resources.

Colleagues,

	Greetings from the UK.

	We've recently changed our clocks from GMT to BST. The time
field on the 'Date:' line in PINE's outgoing EMAIL shows the time as
one hour slow.

	Any suggestions, please ?  We're running under UNIX on a SUN
SPARC-2000.

Cheers,

To whom it may concern:

	While I was reading an old e-mail from Norway, a bug report
flashed on the screen.  I had no trouble with the message earlier.  I plan
to delete it.

Strangely enough, afaics, pico in pine doesn't support spell. *hmpf* It
doesn't support piped commands either. To say the least, this suxx.

Easiest (and imao best) thing to do is use an alternate editor. It can be
set in M(ain), S(etup), C(onfig). emacs would be a nice choice. Otherwise,
I'd suggest using an alternate editor that supports spellchecking.

Quite easy: All you need is a felt pen, a sharp knife and a round sheet of
paper, about 3.5' in diameter. Maybe a mousechord, too... A glass might come
handy too...

Apart from that:

Check if you have mtools on your system.

Dear Robin and Discussion Group
	Thanks for your quick response to my query. I have earlier to-day
responded to Joe Young as follows: I mentioned this problem to a
graduate student in our chemistry program who came up with a good, simple,
solution that might be of interest.

	It is possible when in COMPOSE to POSTPONE the piece, go to MAIN,
then to POSTPONED MESSAGES and finally to PRINT. It works fine!
 Thanks, Bob Allan.

Subject: Spell checker not working
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

We having a problem with the spell check not working in Pine 3.96.

I can run pico in standalone mode an turn on an alternative spell check,
ispell, via the environment variable SPELL.  Setting SPELL does not turn
this on within Pine.

I tried to change the Pine configuration variable spell to use ispell, but
that just hung up, ispell was not invoked and I was stuck.

This pine was built as a part of Debian Linux.  Other than this issue, all
seems to be fine and we have a number of users beating on it all the time.

Any tips would be appreciated.

Subject: message interrupts
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

One  of  the  features I really like about Pine is that  if a call is  
interrupted, the message I'm composing  is saved. ''' Or is it? 
Well, sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't! 
I have Pine set to send postponed messages to the  postponed-message
folder, and deadletter quelled. 

Sometimes, upon re-entering the composer, the entire message is there, 
waiting for me to proceed. 
At other times, when connecting  to Pine, it tells me there's an 
interrupted message, c will ask if I want to continue it (no won't erase
it), but when I try to continue, i get an "empty folder" prompt. 
Is there any way I can setup Pine to: 
1. be consistent; 
2. always have the interrupted message available  to  continue. 
(I've also tried this with dead.letter on, but  it seems to work the  
same). 
Any ideas? 
All advice from  Pine  experts welcome!

1. Put a decent subject on your mails.

2. State the OS you're working with.

3. State the version of pine you're working with.

Apart from that (and I presume you're using pine on linux):

1. Easy: If you have mtool, say this in the shell:

	mcopy a:<path\filename> ~/
	
2. A little trickier:
	
	mount /dev/fd0 /floppy  #provided fd0 is you floppy and /floppy
				exists, otherwise say
	mkdir /floppy 		#or alternately try /mnt instead, then say:
	
	cp /floppy/<filename> ~/

3. Impossible:

	If you're not Ruth and don't have mtools, talk to your sysadmin.
	
HTH,
Robin

When you are looking at a message you can just hit "H" to toggle the full
header mode.  If this doesn't work then you may need to go into the
configuration to enable that.

   From the Main menu, type "S" (setup), then "C" (config).  Type "W"
(wheris) and enter "head".  This should take you to the
"enable-full-header-command" where you can put in an "X" to enable it.
Hit "E" to exit and "Y" to save and you should be done.  "O"  "K" ;)

Did you try putting in the full path to ispell in your pine configuration?

For example: From the Main menu, do S (setup) C (Config).

At the setting "Speller" you may need to put in something like:

	speller = /usr/local/bin/ispell

Your full path may vary!

Hope that helps.

No.

When I addressed this problem to a developer
asking for a notification I got this answer:

	Quoting myself:
	> And still there is no indication the body of the text sent by that
	> tells me whether this response has been posted or not.  Will this
	> change with Pine-4?

	Quoting developer:
	If you mean an automatic addition of text to that effect, no.
	If you see both a Newsgroup header and To: filled in, you can
	already tell, however, unless a news/mail gateway subverts that.  

So we will have to live with Pine not giving us info about "mail or post".
If only Pine would include an X-Mailer or X-Newsreader to identify itself!
Then you could add whatever to your favourite mailer and let it say
"this was sent with Pine as a MAILER" or even "this was posted with PINE, too".

Well, that's my top wish for Pine-4.  That's why it is in the wishlist I keep:

Given the pine display filter config

   _BEGINNING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED")_ /home/david/pine-filter-bug

and the shell program pine-filter-bug which contains the two lines

    #!/bin/sh
    head -1 </dev/tty

then when trying to display a message that triggers the filter, pine will
continuously burn CPU time until the filter finishes, e.g. while the
filter is waiting for human input.  (This is a simplified case for
debugging purposes -- a customer used up much of his monthly computing
quota when he got distracted with a phone call while my PGP-integration
filter was prompting him to enter his PGP Pass Phrase.) 

I've duplicated this behavior using pine 3.96 on Linux and pine 3.95 on
AIX 4.1.5

This is a bad thing on a multi-user system, especially one which tracks
resource usage (like ours).

Excuse me, Heather, but this is probably the sweetest and most innocent
thing I've ever heard :-)

Apart from that, there's nothing much to say. Without physical contact with
your hardware, there's not telling what's wrong. Talk to your local help
desk, or, if you're talking about a pc at home, talk to your local hardware
salesman.

Sweet, sure.  But I'm wondering how she "reprograms" her printer.  :-)

Most areas have 'consultants' that will do house calls if need-be.

    Because you mention procmail, I am assuming you are using some sort
of Un*x system.  Therefore, for general interest, I will repeat the
post I made some time ago about a kludge for using killfiles _ahead_ of
starting Pine to read newsgroups.

    Procmail does not filter news.  It only deals with mail.  I was
the one who suggested running trnkill before reading news with Pine. 
It is a short Un*x script, and I will append it below my signature. 
There are several aspects that are necessary to know about using it.

1)  Obviously, it only works on Un*x systems.

2)  trn must be installed on your system and in your $PATH.

3)  You must have killfiles.  That is a small subject in itself which I
    won't go into here, although they are not too difficult to set up
    for basic operations.  man trn  can supply some information.

4)  There is one minor glitch in the interface with Pine.  Suppose at
    the moment, the highest-numbered message on your system for
    newsgroup soc.culture.junk.trash is 12345.  It just so happens 
    that that article meets a killfile criterion, so trnkill updates
    your .newsrc to mark 12345 as read.  Now you are going from
    newsgroup to newsgroup in Pine with the <tab> key.  If the next
    group you tab to is soc.culture.junk.trash, Pine sees that the
    highest-numbered article in the group right now is the same as the
    highest-numbered article marked as read in .newsrc, so it skips the
    whole newsgroup.  Pine does not notice that there are some
    intermediate numbers which have not been marked as read.  However,
    you can manually go back to the folder display, highlight the
    group, and open it "by hand."  This glitch is more a nuisance than
    a real bug.

    Pine itself has no concept of "public" or "private" replies.  Just
incoming emails and newsgroup postings.  Public and private largely
depend on the medium of transmission employed by the sender, which Pine
has no control over.  See reply after third paragraph.  (Of course, in
email there can be encryption for privacy, but that's a different
matter.)

    It is possible for a sender to transmit a message as an email and
in the same process send it to a newsgroup.  If an incoming email also
has a newsgroup header, Pine can detect that and query you.  It is up
to you to decide whether you want your secondary reply to go out by
email, by the newsgroup, or both.  Pine is just passively reporting on
what is presented to it.  It is the sender on the other end who
controls things for the message you receive, not Pine on your end.

> Anyone know if there's a way to set pine so that it will recognize or 
> notify whether a newsgroup reply was posted publicly or not?

    This seems a little confused to me.  If a reply (technically called
a followup) is posted to a newsgroup at all, then almost by definition
it is public, whatever the sender's intentions may have been.  Private
replies should go by email.  It is really up to the sender to get the
difference straight, not Pine, which is passive in thic case on the
receiving end.  Once again, Pine has no concept of "public" or
"private."

    In situations like this, a little attention, intelligence, and
knowing how things work go a long way.  Before sending a reply, ALWAYS
CHECK THE HEADERS.  Even experienced users have tripped over their own
feet by not checking the headers closely enough.  No matter how good
software is, at some point some things are up to the user.

I don't remember if this is in the FAQ or where, but Ispell doesn't
work well with pine.  (Has this been fixed yet?  Is it going to be?)

In order to use Ispell you need to set it up as an alternate editor.
Then you would invoke it with ^_.

Good luck.

What's a "house call"? You get to pay $500 /h for the repair, but the sex is
free?

BTW, Heather is using an Apple dinosaur, the second most pathetic of all
computers (well, there's NT running on Alphas...), so that buries all hope
of actully helping.

Sex?  There's sex involved?  I'll book a flight, now.  The $500 will cover
the plane fare.

Seriously, techies with basic PC knowledge will often work for $25/hour to
help users out.  If you can find a decent consultant its usually cheaper
than dealing with computer stores and a lot less trouble.

An apple dinosaur... I guess that an Apple II.  Wow.  But anyway, I
thought NT on a MIPS was worse. The Alpha actually has enough power that
the high end alpha's running NT can almost do as much as a 386 running 
linux.

Subject: Deferred news postings with pine ??
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hi,

is there any chance to tell pine to keep the newspostings just like it did
it when the smpt - server value isn't set ??

I mean to keep the postings until the connection will be established and
the 'sendmail -q' (I know this isn't a nice way to deliver mail but 
it works) command is started ?

Is there a general chance to write several articles offline and deliver
them (up to now I only use a PPP line that's why) the same way I deliver
mail at the moment ??

Thank you.

Heiko

BTW: Please could you send me a mail too - I didn't always read this
newsgroup - cu

To whom it may concern:

While I was reading an post from smith.edu today, a stupid sentence flashed on

You could alternally use a better editor or the program "screen"
(which allows to switch between programs on the terminal)
and simply start whatever program in another window.

	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/screen/

Right now one "window" runs my shell (zsh), another has my editor (vim),
one more has my newsreader (slrn) and in another I run my mailer (mutt).
And if I should need a printout of some file then I switch to my shell
and let "a2ps" do some magic on the file and hand it over to "lpr".  :-)

I've started receiving mail containing two parts.  The first part is
usually a few lines of ASCII text.  The second part is about 2.9KB
long and PINE 3.91 identifies it as application/MS-TNEF.  The only
thing I can do with the second part is save it to a file but it is made
as an html file,so when i tried to open it from my one of the browsers
ive got(netscape 3.01 and Explorer 3.02)it shows me extrange text... 
.  I asked someone who
sent me such a message what he was doing,and he answered me that he was
using Internet exchange and after I warned him about this application/ms
tnef which appared in each e-mail it he told me:it must be happening
that the exchange is not going well(?),and he was going to change the
e-mail application client.He didn't indicate he had done anything
different
when sending the mail without the attachment.

So, what is the MS-TNEF attachment?  Why is it called an application?
What causes it to be sent?  Is it necessary?  If not, how can it be
avoided?

pico seeps to support spell on the school's general access system, at

ok - for mail, procmail works fine.

When composing mail, I would like pine to show longer headers so that
I can see the complete names of some custom headers I have set up.  Is
this possible?  How is it done?


Thanks,

Take this up with your provider. In simple terms it means you're over quota.

I don't think I know the right answer, but you might want to try playing
with the setting
 
last-time-prune-questioned=97.5
 
to something high. So assuming that is year.month it asked you last,
I would try setting it to say 98.1 (98 Jan or something ...).

Hi!
We use Pine 3.93 on our UNIX network and I was wondering if Pine can send
enriched text msgs. And if so, how does one compose such a msg? I know that
Pine 3.93 can interpret enriched text because it shows the <bold> text
brighter and the underlined text underlined and so on..
Anybody got a clue?

I use it all the time. I think it just puts the list name on the To line.
So what everyone sees is in fact a non-reply'able expression. I strongly
support LCC option.

How do you log-in, if, like me, you access through terminal emulation
software, there is no reason AFAIK that you couldn't create a macro there
for typing all those key-strokes, and use one of the alt-(PC), cmd-(MAC)
keys for that sequence.

	Hi,

	I have a question.
	I want to attach a file to my e-mails. But the same file is going
to be attached to all e-mails. Is there a way to attach it by default?
	Otherwise I have to choose "To files" option and select the file
each time. 
	Thanks,
	
	Baris

Just today, I was farting around with M$ 'outlook express', the mail
client that comes with new version of Internet Explorer. I sent myself
a piece of mail, and retrieved it using AK-Mail, another win95 mail
client. To my surprise, right under my test message text there appeared
some html tags with the same message. I did it again, but this time
picked up the mail with Netscape (version 4.0 pr#4), and the html tags
did not appear, only the test message. Netscape mail, though, is html
aware, so I came to the conclusion that M$'s mail utils are sending
html mail, but with plain text as a default. For non-html aware clients,
such as Pine (and my AK-Mail), I suppose that M$ is inserting a boundary
between the plain text and the html enabled mail text.

Anyway, after you save the attachment, have you looked at it with just
a plain old file viewer? Since you're using Pine, you must have Pilot,
just load it up there and see if it's the same message between html
tags.

recently I noticed the following mail in my inbox for the first time:

| Date: Tue, 6 May 1997 18:11:39 +0200 (MET DST)
| From: Mail System Internal Data <MAILER-DAEMON@localhost>
| Subject: DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE -- FOLDER INTERNAL DATA
|
| This text is part of the internal format of your mail folder, and is not
| a real message.  It is created automatically by the mail system software.
| If deleted, important folder data will be lost, and it will be re-created
| with the data reset to initial values.

Can anybody shed some light on this? Who put it in the inbox, is it
something sendmail 8.8.5 (I upgraded recently) does or does it belong
to PINE? I don't want this message in my inbox. If it needs to be
there, it should at least hide itself so that it doesn't confuse the
MUA.

Why, when I enter Setup, then select Options, do I get only the message "No

this...  

Can anyone give me a pointer here??  I'm a Pine newbie <g>.

    When all else fails, have you read the instructions before
inquiring?  I would suggest looking in the configuration for something
that seems to deal with headers, as well as all the online help
available both for each configuration item and for Pine as a whole 
(from the Main Menu).

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Hi there,

just go in your pine.conf or .pinerc, find the entry which says
'customized-hdrs', and enter

    If the header on your post is any indication, you are using an old
and obsolete version of Pine, so old that I don't even know whether
this answer will apply to you.

    As Pine comes out of the box, no, it cannot do what you want.  You
can change the domain name portion of your address, but not the userid. 
However, you may set whatever personal name you want.  At the same
time, modern versions of Pine may be compiled by a system administrator
to allow changing the From: line entirely.  This is a special option
which many installations avoid deliberately.  Still -- and I am not
certain about this -- it is conceivable that somebody with enough
expertise could divine your email address from the message envelope.

    P.S.  People would appreciate it if next time you would use a more
descriptive subject on your message than just "help."

The message is put there by the University of Washington POP3 and IMAP
servers, ipop3d and imapd.  If you delete it, the POP3 and IMAP servers
may serve messages you've already seen (but nothing bad will happen).
Have you recently accessed your mailbox using Eudora, Netscape Navigator,
or some other POP3 or IMAP client?  If so, that's what resulted in
the message.

	Okay, this is an easy one.  What is the command to delete say
messages numbered from 1 to 400 without typing d for every single one
of the 400 messages?

    From the message-id alone, I would surmise that you probably can't.

    I just made a check both with my memory and in a spot check of
saved message folders.  All newsgroup postings I could see or recall
which I viewed with Pine have a  Newsgroups:  header, including Sven's,
which he apparently posted with slrn.  I'm not sure just what process
puts this header in, but it is already there in some form or other
before Pine ever gets into the picture as a newsreader.  I run trn in a
sort of batch mode to run killfiles, and I can and do use Newsgroups:
as a kill criterion.  So the Newsgroups: header is not an artifact of
Pine reading the post.  I have also received mail with both a To:
header and a Newsgroups: header, but I presume one knows whether s/he
is reading mail or news.

    I really am rather confused by the original poster's distinction
between "private" and "public" in this arena.  Pine knows of no such
things.  It only knows of mail and news, and news by definition is a
public medium, whether or not Pine even existed.  If you want private,
go to encrypted email.  To be honest, I fail even to see what the real
issue is here.  Is it a question of HOW TO USE PINE to get the results
you want when replying?  That's mostly a matter of paying attention to
what you're doing, watching the headers, and reading the prompts.  As
it now is, Pine's design assumes you can take at least a minimum amount
of responsibility for what you are doing.

Thanks.  Wouldn't it be nice if Pine's context-sensitive help for
download-command gave "sz -a" as an example or recommendation?

Does download-command-prefix help with this problem in Zmodem?

Here I also missed a good example in the help text.  The most
intuitive choice "rz" doesn't seem to work because "rz" doesn't accept
any filename arguments from the command line.  However the "rx"  for
Xmodem receives does fine.  With upload-command=rx you can easily
press ^R(ead File) ^Y(upload) and then Alt-S(end) X(modem).

Yeah, that's an easy on alright... If you want to get rid of your mail rsn,
just say this:

	for name in ~/Mail/[a-zA-Z]* ; do rm -rf $name ; done

As a "UNIX Administrator & Web Master", you should be aware that (as someone
pointed out some time ago), rm means "read mail" and the -rf option means
"real fast". It is somewhat related to yamc, ie rtfm. But being a true
professional, you knew that, oc.

BTW, I *really* do like your signature. It's too long, too wide, and
contains obviously counterfactual claims about your profession. What kind of
"UNIX" are you administering --- Windows?

Robin

P.S. The answer is "aggregate commands", but being a "UNIX Administrator &
Web Master", you were probably just joking in the first place...

1.  For general help about starting Pine see its manual page.  Assuming
you are on a UNIX system this is usually shown by giving the command:
	man pine

2.  Use Pine's built-in help to learn about its many commands and
features.  The Ctrl/G command will always display these help screens (and
"?" will also do so unless it could legitimately be entered as a part of
the field your cursor is currently on).  Pine's help is
"context-sensitive"; it tells you about the thing you are currently
doing/your cursor is on.  So don't assume that what you first see is all
that there is!

3.  Check the Pine home page on the World-Wide Web:
	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/

Cheers,

The message "disk quota exceeded" is not being caused by Pine per se.
Instead it is coming from your operating system, and Pine is merely
passing the message on to you.

In particular "disk quota exceeded" means that you have exceeded your disk
quota(!).  That is, you are using up too much disk space with files and/or
messages.

You need to release some space by deleting any files you no longer need. 
At some sites each message you keep in a folder may use up some of your
disk quota too, so you may also need to delete any messages you no long
want to keep.  Contact your local help desk for advice.

Cheers,

It would have been a BIG help if you had bothered to say if you are using
(UNIX) Pine or PC-Pine, and what version number you are using (it's
usually shown up in the top-left corner of the Pine display).

The configuration screen was introduced in (I think) version 3.90 or 3.91
of Pine.  It has been enhanced, expanded and developed in more recent
versions.

The current version of Pine is 3.96.  It sounds as if you are using a
really old version.  Check, and if you are, then look at upgrading to the
current version.  This is available by anonymous ftp from
ftp.cac.washington.edu.

Cheers,

0.  Check your Setup Configuration screen and make sure that
"enable-aggregate command-set" is selected.  Whilst there, put your cursor
on this option and read its built-in help by typing "?".

1.  Return to the Index screen.

2.  Use the ; (Select) command to choose some messages according to some
criteria, following the menu at the bottom of the screen.  For example:

	; N 1-400

3.  Apply a command to the selected messages.  For example:

	A D

Keep watching the command menu at the bottom of the screen as you work
through these: that way you'll see what other selection criteria are
available, and what other commands can be applied to selected messages.

Cheers,

Subject: Don't expand newsgroups
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Actually I have a few pine questions. I've checked the FAQ.

How do I get pine to not expand the newsgroup fold but still expand the 
mail folders?  I'm using pine 3.90.

What is the latest version of pine?  3.96?  What was the release date?  
My ISP claims pine isn't being supported any more and is "old".  Where is 
the official site to retrieve the latest version?

I really like pine. I rather telnet to my ISP to use pine rather than 
using Endura (or Pegasus Mail) via POP3.

Thanks,
Steven

Hi.  I was recently informed by the computer that my disc quota has been
exceeded, and therefore with numerous beeps, it told me I could no longer
save anything.  Neither can I append new addresses to my address book.  I
consequently deleted a large number of files, but this seems to have made
no difference.  Help?
Thanks,
Paula Rand

You can't do this in any version of Pine.  The default is either to expand
collections or to not expand them.  (I think there have been rumours of
more per-folder and/or per-collection control in a future release but am
not sure.)

3.96 is indeed the current version of Pine.

I don't know if there's an official release of dates past versions were
released anywhere, but going off the date-stamps of the old versions'
distribution files:

	3.87	< 23 Aug 1994
	3.88	< 23 Aug 1994
	3.89	< 23 Aug 1994
	3.90	26 Aug 1994
	3.91	11 Oct 1994
	3.92	18 Mar 1996
	3.93	11 Apr 1996
	3.94	12 Jun 1996
	3.95	15 Jul 1996
	3.96	28 Feb 1996

Version 4.00 is being developed by the Pine Team even now.

Perhaps what your ISP is _really_ saying is that _they_ don't support Pine
any more?!

> Where is the official site to retrieve the latest version? 

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/

You can get the source code kit and compile it yourself, or pull a
pre-compiled binary for a number of platforms.

If you have a PC running Windows *and* your ISP provides an IMAP server
then you may like to investigate PC-Pine (which runs on your PC).
Available from the same place.

Cheers,

Why?  Because your "disc quota has been exceeded"!

Most sites limit the amount of information each user can store on their
computers.  "Information" may be files that you have created as part of
your work, and may also include messages you have stored in folders.

The solution is to release some of your disc quota by deleting any files
and/or messages you no longer need to keep.

Please contact your local help desk for furhter advice... you sent you
message to a world-wide list of people who discuss the Pine mail program;
we do not have access to your computers and cannot advise further on what
you should delete or how to do it.

Cheers,

After some minor hacking with makefiles and ucbcc program bits i have managed
to get most of the pine suite compiled.

pico/pilot/imap/c-client etc.

But cannot for the hell get pine compiled. If fails on the first C file.

addrbook.c

Anyone any ideas ?

To the growing list of posters who are getting 'disk quota
exceeded' messages:  if you're looking ONLY in your Pine folders
for files to delete, start looking elsewhere.  In my experience
with clients, the most likely place to find large files (or large
numbers of small files) is the home directory of your unix
account.  Next most likely would be your News or .tin
subdirectories, if either applies to your installation.  If you
need keystroke-specific command help, talk to your provider.

Mike Brudenell responded:

I think what Steve's ISP or admin is saying is:  Gee, I can't really
figure out how to use anything besides a graphical client (like Eudora,
etc.), therefore anything I don't understand is "old" and not used.  I had
an experience with an ISP who told me the same thing when I was discussing
a Pine issue with them.  I cancelled my account the next day.  It was
painfully obvious they had no clue how to use Pine, or BSD Mail, or any
text-based client, much less any intention of supporting one.  

A friend told me this when we were discussing the fate of Pine and other
UNIX based mailers:  "The techs and code-geeks (his words, and he's one of
them :) will always have to provide solutions to those who refuse to type,
stretch their minds, or generally have to think.  We like text based mail,
and generally the rest of the Internet how *we* designed it.  That way,
it'll still be usable by intelligent people, and the GUI's will keep the
money, popularity, and content increasing and flowing."

Yeah... he's a little pretentious, but I think he has interesting point.

As Mike suggested, see if your ISP supports IMAP and get a copy of
PC-Pine.  Don't worry:  Pine's here to stay.  That is, until they develop
a GUI mailer that can allow thousands of University students to read,
store, and compose mail without getting a computing lab machine's
configuration and resources all screwed up.  GUI clients are just starting
to allow access to multiple mailboxes over IMAP.  Pine's WAY ahead of the
game for this purpose.

OK, I'm off of my soapbox now... :)

Good point, Lea.  I hear a lot of complaints about quotas exceeded by the
same users who love to leave several proceses running and just exit their
telnet client without logging off their shell, letting core dumps pile up
in their accounts.  These users should look for these files (any file with
"core" usually in the name) and delete them. 

Just another suggestion....

I think it would also be a big help if the version string included the OS, eg:

	DOS-PINE-3.96
	UNIX-PINE-4.01
	Linux-PINE-4.2

How about this for the next release?

There are newsreaders which you can run to apply the killfile automatically
on the newsrc.  You don't have to use them for reading only, see?  ;-)

The killfile part is easy:

	"PINE does not have a killfile.  Period."

That was easy.  Next!!

	$EDITOR $MAIL

On my system here this wille expand to

	vim /var/spool/mail/guckes

If your system writes the mailbox with Content-Length
then you can be quite in trouble as editing will almost
certainly change the length of the messages.

Therefore you should delete the lines before calling your mailer on this folder:

	:g/^Content-Length: /d

But there are even more ways to screw it up,
so don't do it unless you know what you do!
You have been warned!  ;-)

Probably in the wrong house but need to talk with a higher form of life.
Someone who knows how to get the software up and running. All I can get is
a empty screen that has a feww commands across the bottom that do not

Using pine3.91 on SunOS4.1.3

Please can anyone tell me what should be in the active file for 
local newsgroups. Is it a list of newsgroup pathnames and if so
should it be the full path or relative to news-spool-directory.
I know how to tell pine where to look for the active file, it's what it
actually is I can't find any instructions for. I can't get local news
to work.

SunOS4.1.3
Is pine 3.96 more particular about permissions?
I have compiled and installed 3.96 in the same way as I did 3.91 - the
ownership and execute permissions are exactly the same.
When I try to send a message with 3.96 I get a sendmail message cannot
write the queue file - permission denied and a coredump.
Any ideas?

Hi,

Is it possible to use or transform a large text file (in some
arbitrary format with about 2000 mail-adresses) as your personal
adressbook. Are there any tools to do this conversion ? The idea
is to offer a campus-wide adressbook to our university.

Angeles:

As ashamed as I am to admit it, I do have familiarity with America Online.
:)  America Online is not an internet service provider, they are an
online service provider.  This means that they do have access to internet
resources, but the majority of their content is proprietary (they design
it, and it's not available elsewhere).  The chat and buddy list features
your friend has are proprietary to America Online (actually they're bad
imitations of IRC the *real* internet chat), so you can't use them on the
internet.  "Talk" is a UNIX daemon (program) that allows two users to chat
in real time on their telnet terminals.  Again, AOL does not have this.  

But!  I *think* that new versions of AOL (not sure about international
versions) have a true TCP/IP stack, so you could use an IRC client to chat
with him/her in that way.  To use "talk", both you and your friend would
have to have a UNIX shell account.  

Best advide though:  get your friend to use a *real* ISP, not AOL.  Your
possibilities are ten-fold then.

Hope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions!

Maurice:

There is software (or a script) that will do this for you, but I've been
able to do it using Microsoft Excel, actually!

If you can import your data into Excel (on Windows, probably), the import
wizard will help you parse your text into columns.  Your column order
needs to be: Nickname, Fullname, Address, Fcc, Comment

Save the parsed data without any header in "Text (Tab delimited)" format
in Excel.  Then FTP this file up to where you want the global addressbook. 
The .addressbook.lu should be rebuilt when it's accessed. 

This did work for me.  Hopefully it'll work for you.  I've seen tools that
will do this, but I can't remember where I saw them / heard of them.

Good luck,

I'm really confused about this one, Terry. A Unix Admin/Web Master and
wanting to know that?

Uh, I use PINE 3.96 and select using ";" and then "N" for number and the
range of numbers. Seems pretty simple--hope it wasn't a trick question. :)

I ended up turning off expanded-view-of-folders and setting up a initical
key sequence of l,CR.  It gives the same affect.  The reason I wanted to
do this is it was taking a long time to do a folder list becasue it has to
expand the newsgroup every time.  My provider supplies 28,000+ newsgroups
through his newsfeed.  I normally don't use pine for news.  But there 
have been occasions I had to use Pine to read certain binary posts.

I am trying to port PICO 2.9 and ELM to my HP9000 G40 
running HP-UX 10.01.  We are running WYSE60 terminals (24 line 
display).  Everything works fine EXCEPT the arrow keys.
Without this feature my users (100+) will be clueless on 
how to use the editor.  Can you give me some ideas on this ?
Thanks in advance.

Make them clueful - arrow keys are not required to do work.
Btw, you misspelt "mutt" and "vim".  Hope this helps.  ;-)

Seriously - what do these terminals say about arrow codes?

To whom this may concern,

It's my first time to use the pine program, and I would like to inquire if
I can gain access to specific e-mail addresses.  Are they (e-mail
addresses) kept confidential or otherwise ?  Is there such a thing as a
"phone book" for e-mail addresses?

Thank you and God bless.

Sincerely,

    From the Main Menu, go into Setup and then Config.  Scroll down
until you come to a field called customized-hdrs:.  There will be
online help available at this point.  You can add your customized
Reply-to: header here.  Either fill in the actual address to which you
want the reply to be sent, and it will be included with every message,
or leave it blank, in which case you can fill it in or not for each
message individually.  (You may have to use Rich Headers, Control-R, 
in this latter case.)

    I have never tried this, so I do not know how it would work. 
Perhaps someone else on the newsgroup can help you with it.

Does anybody know how "display-filters" and "sending-filters" works?  Can
I use these to solve my problem?

When I [E] Export and then [^T] To Files via the Browser I can see the
files I want but I don't know how to select and/or download them.  I seem
to be stuck working with the email message I was looking at when I used
the export command.  Any help would be appreciated.

Robin Socha, it's obvious why you subscribe to this forum, if you didn't,
nobody would write to you.  Please don't bother replying, I don't need the

Subject: PC Pine, or even OS/2 Pine?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've been using Pine for years through my shell account. I love it. I've
finally got my ppp connection set up, though, so I'd like to reap the benefits
of a local mailer.

Help files keep talking about PC-Pine. Does anybody know about such a beast?
I don't suppose there's an OS/2 version of Pine available form anywhere, is
there? I can run Windoze 3.1 software, is there a version for it?

Thanks,
MikZ.

How about seperate kinds of ids for private/public responses?

Well, your posts may be saved like this in your "sent folder" - but I
don't think that Pine adds the Newsgroups line for copies of posts.
It would be very good if Pine *did* add the Newsgroups line!

> I really am rather confused by the original poster's distinction between

Well, posts do have a Newsgroups line in the header -
so when you "reply" to a message including this line
then it will post it, ie hand it over to, say, "inews".
So why can't Pine be so smart as to add *some* note
to indicate that it was a *public* reply?

Well, not everybody enjoys reading through the header looking for clues.
It's about time that Pine showed whether you are reading public or private text.

> As it now is, Pine's design assumes you can take at least
> a minimum amount of responsibility for what you are doing.

It would be nice if Pine helped taking care of that by showing you
whether you are seeing a public response or a private one.

I hate messages from Pine just for that -
you never know whether to reply or followup.

Personally I dunno how they work, I assume it just pipes the message through the filter
program, and send what it prints on stdout. One possibility is to have write a program that
triggers on something like "<lang:xxx>", and interts the apropriate information there.

These people deserve to live with it!  (No, seriously.)

A book on Unix usually explains about core files and how to handle them.
The Shells csh, tcsh, and zsh allow to limit the size of a core dump with a
variable, usually names "coredumpsize".  Set to zero and - no more coredumps.

I do something similar in a cron job reading a list of users from an Oracle

As far as I can tell you have to compose the text/enriched message outside 
of Pine, and then send it as an attachment.  You also need to have an entry 
in your .mime.types file that maps whatever file extension you use on the 
file to the MIME type/subtype text/enriched.

On Unix systems, Pine does the following search for .mime.types files.  
(The following is excerpted from the .mime-types that is distributed with 
Pine).

# Pine first looks for "~/.mime.types", then adds
# any unbound MIME types found in "/etc/mime.types"
# and "/usr/local/lib/mime.types".

Robert:

What you basically need is a bridge between your UNIX account on the
remote server, and your (home?) machine.  This bridge is called FTP (File
Transfer Protocol). FTP is basically used to move data between machines
that are connected via the Internet.  UNIX to UNIX, UNIX to PC, UNIX to
Mac, etc.... 

Assuming you're using your home machine, perhaps a PC, you can use your
web browser to go to the following page: 
	
http://www.ipswitch.com/Products/WS_FTP/pd_wsftp_eu_license.html

This is Ipswitch's download page for their "WS_FTP LE" FTP client for
Windows.  Their home page is www.ipswitch.com.  It's the most widely used
Windows FTP client (I think) and it's FREE to individuals!  

If you're using a Mac, I believe "Fetch" is the rumored best Mac FTP
client.  It's at: 

http://www.dartmouth.edu/pages/softdev/fetch.html

Either of these come with great documentation and help, and you'll be
downloading those files in no time.

Good luck,

Thank you, sir, for your complete and accurate reply. ;)  If you thought I
was looking for the rich headers command, that is not correct.  I have
set some custom headers up.  When I hit ^R pine shows these headers,
but it only shows the first 8 characters of the headers.  I would like
to see more than the first 8 characters of the header.

I have looked in all the documentation available to me and have not
found anything referencing this problem.

I do apologize if the original post was unclear.

  Wrong attitude :-) Try saying: My knowledge is growing with every day :-)

The answer to the question at hand is this:

customized-hdrs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Add these custom headers when composing. Also possible to add default values
to these custom headers or to any of the standard headers. This is a list
variable. Each entry in the list is a header name (the actual header name
that will appear in the message) followed by an optional colon and value.
For example, if a Reply-to header was needed because it was different from
the From address, that could be accomplished with:
          
              customized-hdrs=Reply-to: fred_flintstone@bedrock.net
              
But generally, you might find it helpful to read the documentation that
comes with pine (at least the "Getting Started" part), or a good email-faq
(can be obtained from www.yahoo.com).

I don't quite get this part, honestly :-), but the above should do the
trick.

Depends on how you define "outside". It'll do to invoke an external editor
in pine. XEmacs 19.15 (I know that's ridiculous:_) but at least it's easier
than manually attaching a file... ) could do that, and so could the editor
that comes with the Andrew Toolkit (but that one is GUI only afaik).
  
Just my $.02

1) See to it, that you have some ftp protocol on both your machines. If you
don't have one, get it from e.g. www.yahoo.com.

2) Make up your mind if you want to Export files from pine or ftp files from
your remote computer. There's a slight difference involved, mainly
concerning flexibility and some nifty tech-specs you wouldn't be interested
in, judging from the attitude you display towards the end of your message.

3) Provided your remote host runs some flavr of u*ix, then to make the
Export function work the way you want, you have to do the following:

Goto M(ain), S(etup), C(onfig) and set the following commands:

	download-command
   
	This option affects the behavior of the Export command. It specifies
	a Unix program name, and any necessary command line arguments, that
	Pine can use to transfer the exported message to your personal
	computer's disk.

	download-command-prefix

	This option is used in conjunction with the Download-command option.
	It defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via standard
	output) immediately prior to starting the download command. This is
	useful for integrated serial line file transfer agents that permit
	command passing (e.g., Kermit's APC method).

Robert Sylvester, it's obvious why you subscribe to this forum, if you
didn't, nobody would read your pathetic whining. Please read the mails I've
written in response to EXACTLY the same question *quite* a few times before.

AND...

If you can stand sarcasm, you'll have to live with outright rudeness:
Robert Sylvester, you're a quarrelsome luser:

	grep -i download /READ_ME/Pine/* | less

... and I didn't even have to be rude to my computer to give me the
answer...

Robin

    I would suggest that the first thing you do is try to get some
local help from an experienced person to try to find out what the
would-be mail bomber's real address is.  Most organizations which
provide email service (schools, government agencies, commercial
providers) take such a dim view of mail bombing that they will simply
give a mail bomber the boot.  But you have to know the individual's
real address so you can send a complaint to
postmaster@_mail_bomber's_address_domain_.

    Failing that, from your message headers it appears that you are on
some kind of Un*x system.  If so, you can use a mail filtering tool
such as procmail to discard mail from that person as fast as it comes
in -- and also to log it for proof of what he is doing!  If you have a
WWW browser, browse my home page, follow the link to Nancy McGough's
pages, and go a couple of links in to all of her good information on
mail filtering.  procmail is not always the easiest tool to use for
newcomers, but it is extremely powerful.

    Good luck.

Hi,

The incoming messages as well as the files I have created have reversed
order, in terms of the messages being organized in descending order
instead of ascending. This had just changed one time when I logged on. I
tried to change commands in the setup command, but wasn't sure which
command(s) need to be changed. I'm also wondering if it's not a program
error, because I'm pretty sure I didn't change any of the settings.
Anyway, it's pretty annoying since the highlighted message in the inbox is
now the oldest message instead of the newest. If you have any helpful
suggestions it would be appreciated. Thank you.

This variable sets up the default index sorting. The default is to sort by
arrival order. It has the same functionality as the -sort command line
argument and the $ command in the folder index. If a sort-key is set, then
all folders open during the session will have that as the default sort
order.

In your pinerc, this looks like this:
# Sets presentation order of messages in Index. Choices:
# subject, from, arrival, date, size. Default: "arrival".
sort-key=

Just change that, and you're there.

i have a problem.  i added an address to my addressbook, and now i can't
access any of the saved addresses i had.  i type in a nickname in the
"To:" header when composing messages, and it's not recognized.  i can't
even get into my addressbook to delete some of them.  when i do, it says
"permission denied".  i need help.  i think i added one too many addresses
to my book, and i fear i may have wiped them all out or something.  if you
can help, i'd really appreciate it.  thanx.

sincerely,
chris b.

Just curious... :-\

Has anyone else complained about the global addressbook feature
in the 16-but version of PC-Pine 3.96?  I keep getting a general
protection fault when pine attempts to expand an address from the 
global addressbook.

Any ideas?

I'm using bash, but I have no .bashrc file. I set TMPDIR in my .profile,
TMP is allready set to /tmp/mydir. This made ELM/JOE to write its snd files
into mydir. TMPDIR doesnt help for neither for PINE/JOE nor when I use PICO
to edit a text file. pico files still end up in /tmp. 
I created a .bashrc with export TMPDIR ...
Don't work either... 
Yes, I did log in again to make the changes work.

Why does PINE create a pico file anyway when I use JOE? Probably its just
a name for the tmp file needed for attaching my sig file...

Ciao,
Christian.

I have a strange problem with pine. First the configuration, I am running
pine 3.96 on a Linux box. 

The complaint from the users is that control-c does not work. I have tried
several time to re-create the error on the machines I use all the time. I
cannot get control-c to fail. I HAVE gotten it to fail on other machines. 
We are running for Telnet either Windows 95 telnet or NCSA telnet 2.6 or
2.7.  Most of these machines are Macs. We have check to be sure contrl-c 
is not configured as a "hot key". It makes no difference. 

Do any of you have an idea where else I can look?

	Several installations here of 3.96 have experience the error message:
Error starting print job:  Can't start document

In some instances it will print the doc on the first attempt but if I
attempt a second print of the same message the error message appears. 
If I then change to another msg it will print on the first try but fail
on the second.
	This occurs on direct connected and networked printers as well.

You don't... Pine is a "Mail User Agent" (MUA): a program for reading mail
_aftter_ it has been delivered to you.

Instead you are wanting to persuade the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) which
does the actualt _delivery_ to send back an automatic reply.  If you are
using a (reasonably standard) UNIX system this is usually done using a
".forward" file and a program called "vacation".  Try reading the manual
page for vacation for further help: man vacation.

Altyernatively ask someone at your local Help Desk.

Cheers,

Hi -

I reported this problem to the Pine Team a little while back.  Included
below is their reply.  If you don't fancy waiting for 4.00 or
modifying/recompiling 3.96 you might like to know that we have found no
problems so far with 3.95.

Cheers,

Reply from the Pine Team to my earlier Bug Report...

Date: Thu, 1 May 1997 16:53:19 -0700 (PDT)
From: Michael Seibel <mikes@cac.washington.edu>
To: Mike Brudenell <pmb1@york.ac.uk>
Subject: Re: Bug (ID KR15U): Problems printing from PC-Pine 3.96 to
networked printers (fwd)

Mike, Apologies for the late response!  Turns out the problem has to do
with initialization of the structure passed to the StartDOC library call. 

It appears the Win32 implementation is pretty sensitive to uninitialized
fields (in spite of the fact the documentation indicates that, for our
use, only some fields, which we initialize, are referenced).  The Win16
implementation wasn't as sensitive so we never had such failure. 

We'll certainly have it fixed in the Pine 4.00 release.  In the mean time,
if you can re-build from 3.96 sources, the fix is to edit the file
pine3.96/pico/mswin.c adding the statement: 

        memset(&di, 0, sizeof(DOCINFO));

just before the structure's cbSize and lpszDocName fields are initialized. 
It should be right around line 6110.

Sorry for the problems, and thanks for the report!

Is debug possibly on in the .pinerc file? May pay to check there first.

Robert: if you pay attention to this forum enough to know about Robin's
replies, then why did you open yourself up like that?  Sheesh.  He doesn't
reply to over half the stuff that appears here.  You just made yourself a
target.  All that people like Robin (and I) expect is for people to read
the manual (which is available on the web) and ask there local support.  A
lot of people do that.  Those that are too lazy deserve vituperation. 
Problems that aren't covered by the manual or the web or local people are
more than welcome here.  If people indicate they've /tried/ to read the
FAQ and the manual without luck we will probably be nice to them.  Even
people we vituperate get a useful answer.

Robin: aren't there some group therapy groups for people who can't cope
with sarcasm?  Maybe we should these people to alt.warez or some other
group therapy?  Sheesh.

One of these days when I have some time I'm going to make an
animated gif of a person carrying a sign that says "I CAN'T
RTFM!!"  
Robin and I have had off-list discussions about this before...the
line between lazy and newbie is sometimes pretty blurry.  Robin
leans to the former and I lean toward the latter :-)  
Maybe it's time to reassess what we can do to try and head off
some of the basic questions.  I don't read the newsgroup;  for
those that do, is the feed to the mailing list direct?  What if
we turned it off and let the two exist independently of each
other? That way, if a user first had to sub to the list in order
to post, they'd get a welcome message.  We could rethink the
welcome message and try to structure it such that the information
we want the new user to 'get' - look here for basics, look there
for tutorials, if any of the following are happening to you go
see your sysadmin, here's the basic info we need from you if
you're posting a problem to the list...stuff like that...would be
right there. We could include a warning or disclaimer or whatever
that the person MUST read and follow these list 'rules'.  Then
we could point people back at the 'rules' if they posted
something off or minor...
Anyhow, just random thoughts.  Feel free to rearrange as desired
to suit your personal decor.

Lea

There's this *huge* therapy group... I think it's called reality or
something. People are different, and some will never learn. I wasn't being
sarcastic for the fun of it, but because I felt the original poster was
negligent in a way that was offensive to his readers. Finding the answer in
the on-line help wouldn't have been such a big deal, and formulating a more
specific question wouldn't have been, either.

However, gatewaying alt.flamewar into the list for a couple of hours might
be a refreshing experience for the more touchy people >;-> Hello, Mr
list-admin, do you copy?

Just kidding. It's all a matter of netiquette. I find it quite remarkable
that, during the last two weeks, I couldn't find a single new user who had
read some copy of it. I guess that explains a lot.

Later,
Robin

It already exists. It's a blueish sky with a flying banner saying DOS95 or
something.

Which is perfectly alright imao. Nobody can be expected to know everything
about all u*ix programs, and I personally find myself stuck at least 4-5
times a day. Reading the fine manual doesn't always help either, so making a
question public is a) an intelligent thing to do, b) an honour for the
programmer, because he can see that people are pushing his program to the
limits, and c) an incentive for all readers to learn more about certain
nifty tex-spex. However, an rtfm-bait question is a nuissance, and an insult
to the intellect of those who have to suffer it.

In the case of the original poster, I saw a clear-cut case of "why didn't
those programmers make everything idiot-proof?", so I added a little
incentive for him to readjust his expectations and reevaluate his
cooperativeness at once. The internet is a two-sided "thing" in which one
has to give back what on receives. The original post seemed to be a case of
mere taking ("Where's the button I need to press for my specific needs?"),
so ...

Not good. Sending the faq with every subscription would be a nice thing,
though, because then we could flame every luser to hell in pursuit of a
righteous cause. Hehehe...

No necessary. Pine has everything on board. The help is more than exhaustive
for the vast majority of users. Even the command in question in the original
post was in it. Nuff said. Some people just can't read --- they need others
to spread the Holy Word.  
  
  >We could include a warning or disclaimer or whatever that the person MUST
  >read and follow these list 'rules'. Then we could point people back at

See above. Besides, most users aren't stupid, they're simply lost.
Especially for non-natives (both of English and Computerese), *putting* the
question is the hardest part. Rethink all the "how can I make a reply-to
appear"--questions of the last days. Without grep, you're pretty stuck
sometimes, and even that doesn't cover all problems. How about "aggregate
commands"? Probably the most stupid term a German could think of. I couldn't
find it but indirectly through an answer on the list.

Blablabla... 

Ahh, yes, and there's this, too: Your page is on the internet. It's all
people would need. They don't find it, either because they cannot or they
don't want to. Laziness is a common factor in interpersonal exchange, and on
the internet, it's even worse many times. Guess we'll have to live with it,
won't we?

Heavens, what a day!

Hi...

	I've just gone through the archives looking for any reference to
using Pine/Sendmail/Userdb to rewrite outgoing addresses, and found
stuff relating to Pine 3.91 and pre-8.8.x Sendmail, including suggested
Rules for sendmail.cf to work around the problem...none of which seem to
work with current releases of both.

	Now, I don't know if its a change in 3.96 or 8.8.5 that is causing
the problem, but its gotten to be quite annoying, since Pine seems to be the
only mailer I can't get this to work with :(

	Has anyone been successful in getting this to work with current
releases of both pine and sendmail?

	Pretty much any/all suggestions will be most appreciated, and tried...
I'm getting tired of using Elm :(

Hi Pine gurus,

I'm running Pine 3.95 on Solaris 2.4.  I'd like to disable the feature
that asks at the initiation of Pine, 'To save space, do you want to delete
sent-mail-<month>'.  Does anyone know how to do that?

TIA,
Craig

Hi,
this is about a third time I report this bug.. Noone seems to care. :-( 

As a listowner, I get lots of MIME error messages from the listserv, like
the one I inculde. The trouble is, that pine cannot display them, it says
just something like:

 PINE 3.96   MESSAGE TEXT                    <mail/[]> ll  Msg 1 of 1 ALL      

Date: Wed, 14 May 1997 19:56:45 +0200

To: xmedh02@alfa.vse.cz
Subject: Error Condition Re: Mail System Error - Returned Mail

And that's all. There's probably some kind of bug in the multiple MIME
messages parsing.. When you export the message I have attached to a
folder, run a pine -f on it, you should get the effect I describe, though
the attachement is visible when just viewed. This happens to almost all
MIME error messages from the mailer daemon. (We use listproc 6.0c and
sendmail 8.8.5/IDA-1.6.)

You cannot do this from the Setup Configuration screen within Pine.

However you _can_ if you edit its settings file by hand ($HOME/.pinerc in
the case of UNIX Pine).

In particular look for the "last-time-prune-questioned" variable.  It
currently probably has a value of something like "97.5".  The format is
"yy.mm" where "yy" is the number of years since 1900 and "mm" is the month
number (1-12).

You can fool Pine into not asking you by setting this value into the
future.

And before you ask...

PLEASE NOTE that "yy" is _not_ limited to 2 digits; there is _no_
"Millenium Bug" lurking here.  December 1999 will be 99.12, and January
2000 will be 100.01.  It's amazing how many people have fallen into the
trap of assuming that the year figure is just the last two digits of the
year; I had done so myself before I saw previous answers on this list and
re-read the "localtime" man page!

Cheers,

Contact your local/ISP's Help Desk for assistance.  They can actually
login to your system (we, random people around the world, can't) and see
what is going on.

When you contact them you should also report any error messages that are
being displayed.  Simply saying "it doesn't work" isn't going to give them
much of a toe-hold on the problem!

Cheers,

Forgot to include that if you ask what type file the inbox is using the
following command and the response is ascii file then it is hammered:

	type /var/mail/sinclair

The response s/b "mail folder"

In the sent-mail folder, does an "N" in the column to the left of a
message in the listing of messages indicate that the message has been
read/opened by its recipient?  *Is* there a way to tell if messages have
been read/opened or at least received?

Thanks!

No, it indicates that you haven't looked at the copy in the folder
yet.

No.

No... it is merely indicating that you have not yet read the contents of
the copy of the message stored in the folder.

Not reliably, apart from asking the recipient (eg, ringing them on the
phone).

Not exactly: As pointed out in numerous discussions of this topic before,
there are some servers that acknowledge your mail. You'd have to check that.
Otherwise, you can use a mail filter to set up an autoresponder for the
other party (provided he's not using the other "OS"). However, this solution
is not everybody's cup of tea and should be used as a last resort for really
urgent deliveries only.

Later,
Robin

I loaded a Java Development Kit on our Unix Dec Alpha 4.0 server. It calls
for a few environment variables to be set in my .login file. I have a line
in my .login file that is somehow conflicting with my ability to send mail
from Pine. The line is as follows:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/bin/java/lib

If I comment this line out, I can send mail from Pine. If I don't comment
out this line, when I hit ctrl-x to send my composed message, I get the
following error:

Stack overflow: pid 22203, proc pine, addr 0x11fdffff0, pc 0x1200f52c8

I'm using Pine 3.96. I'll also attach a copy of my .login file just in
case.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Fwd'g upon suggestion of automated response.

Subject: Sug (ID VI8GY): pine address book to NETSCAPE format. 

DEAR SIRS:

I have a user who asked about importing a PINE address book
and mailing lists with aliases for our organization to NETSCAPE mail
utility on his pc where he would like to do his composing and editing.  
The PINE list is maintained by one of our secretaries and used in
a UNIX networked environment to facilitate it being shared.

Do ya'll know of anything that will facilitate or accomodate this person's
request.  I am currently looking a Major Domo for other features.

			Thanks,

			Matt Naiman

I'm using pine with the option

		{pop3server/pop3}INBOX

all is working well but I have a problem, when I enter to a new session
always I get the "N" status on all messages eventhought I read it. How
Can I get the right status? Is there a solution?

Thank you.

Juan Jose Davila D.

PINE does a default level of 4.  You can set the debug level to zero,
which will prevent PINE from making debug files.  The command is "pine -d
0" (that's zero, not the letter "o", in case your terminal emulation makes
it confusing).

  I believe it's a feature, done on purpose, to tell clearly which
  posts (or e-mails) are FOR you and which are FROM you.
  To have the same look-and-feel for e-mail and news.
  I like it.

  The fact your post appears as "To: newsgroup" on YOUR screen does
  not mean it does on everybody else's screen in the world. They do

Subject: Experience with premail .45 and pine 3.95
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Can anyone provide examples of how to use premail .45 with pine 3.95 or
later?  I'm principally interested in working with the nym.alias.net
nymserver.

I keep getting a pipe error when specifying "/usr/local/bin/premail -oem -t
-oi" 
as the sending-filters parameter.  I have also tried specifying
"/usr/local/bin/premail -oem -t -oi" as the sendmail-path parameter in the
.pinerc file.  How do the sending-filters and sendmail-path parameters
work?

In addition, how do you use the rich header, "Chain:"?  Do you then specify
the number of remailers in this header?  How would you use "Sign:" to do a
similar thing?  Should you be using these at all?

Finally, just knowing how to manually use premail without any mailer (Pine
or Netscape etc. would be a big help in determining where the errors come
from.)

Thanks and please respond to patton@eece.maine.edu

Hi,

=09I usually receive messages in Portuguese, and after some changes in=20
the configuration I managed to make Pine write words with special=20
characters (like "liga=E7=F5es", for instance) in an understandable way.=20
However, if words like that come in the subject (which is rather common),=
=20
nothing works anymore. Even with the iso-8859 character set configurated,=
=20
I get stuff like =3D?iso-8859-1?Q?Eha=3DED?=3D in my messages. Any hint of =
how=20
to fix this? I run Pine 3.91 on Unix.

=09Best regards,=20

Usually this is caused by the telnet intercepting control-c for its own
use. A work around is to use ESC-ESC-C instead (Pine always interprets
ESC-ESC-character as control-character).

The mailbox you enclosed contained a broken MIME message. The Content-Type
header had a mime multipart/mixed identifier but didn't have the required
'boundry=' parameter. In addition the first part of the message (before the
first boundry line) is ignored by true MIME clients, this appears to be
useful text in this message so it's in the wrong place.

The problem isn't with Pine but is with the software that created the message.

Having said that, it would be nice if Pine could notice the fact it's
broken and do something (Like pretending it's not a MIME message)

Can the "pine -d 0" be placed in the .pinerc file or must it be done
each time pine is accessed. Could not find where default was set in
.pinerc and would like to have it automated instead of having to doit
every time I access.

Ok, while you still have access to the internet, start your web-browser and
go to 
	http://www.yahoo.com
and check for the internet section. There are *many* good documents. In
particular, look for anything that says email and faq (frequently asked
questions) or tutorial.

  >	How will an institution like University get registered for e-mail
  >& Internet?

Basically, you only need one *big* computer, a phone line, and a few
terminals. With the big computer, make a connection to a so-called internet
servive provider (ISP), who is permanently on-line. That's the simplest
solution I could think of (I've no idea how things look like in Nigeria, so
I'll assume we're not talking a million $ a month for a *real* solution).
With this setup, you could give about fifty students on-line access without
having to pay a penny for the software. This could all be done with Linux,
the free u*ix for almost all computer platforms (if anyone out there's
running Linux on an Alpha, I'd like to talk to him, pls :-) ). If you gave
your students email access only, the following setup would do:
	1. Server: 			$5000
	2. Terminals (used 386ers)	$250 apiece
	3. Networking stuff		$2500
That'd be all for a start. :-)

  >	All the information is as regard to Nigeria.

Hmmm, I hope I didn't fall into some information trap, but from what I've
seen on tv, Nigeria has certain smaller deficits as far as
tele-communication goes :-) if that's what you mean. The above system could
be run by sending email once an hour or so. So that shouldn't be a problem
either.

  >This informations needs urgent attention.

Hope this helps. There are other, far more competent people than I on this
list, and on the net in general. Check the related newsgroups for further
information.
	alt.education.email-project
Sounds like something... There is a German project that roughly translates
"get those schools on the net". They've written some very decent software
for schools. I'm sure something similar exists in other countries to. Check
for that, too --- why re-invent the wheel, right?

HTH,
Robin

The trouble is, that many mailer daemons produce these - I guess a vast
majority of those that use MIME, at least from what I get.. :-(

They say elm/metamail display these messages with a warning. I would
really like to see pine doing the same thing..

Ok, this has nothing to with pine as such. You need a package called
metamail.

       The  metamail  program reads a "mailcap" file to determine how to
       display non-text at the local site. Every mail- reading interface
       needs to call metamail whenever non-text mail is being viewed, unless
       the mail is of a type that is already understood by the mail-reading
       program. Metamail consults the mailcap file(s) to determine what
       program to use to show the message to the user.
       
Try saying "which metamail" to check if you have it. If so, gain root
permissions and edit /etc/mailcap. I haven't checked this, but something
like the following should do the trick:

	application/pdf ; xpdf %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

Robin

To bad, that there is no hint in the FAQ or in the area around, on the
other hand, this isn't a pine-only related problem. You don't need to run
pine as your mailer to use this behavior of your mail.

if you want to keep a local copy of your mail, just add your local
account-name and a heading slash in your .forward-file.
i.e.:
\lacst20, your_other@mail.somewhere.else

Hope this works.

A comma as a seperator for more than one address should work. Put them in
one line, like the example above.

Hi,
	I've installed Pine ver. 3.96 on my pc, running win 3.11. For some
reason, when pine copies messages from our mail server to the local disk
it removes it from the server.
	Can anything be done about it? I checked the configuration setup, but
failed to located a relevan option.

Looks like these characters will need "iso-8859-1" - not "iso-8859".  ;-)

Upgrade!  Pine-3.96 has been out for a while!

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Hmmm, I haven't come across the problem myself, but until (if) they make
the change in Pine I expect your best bet would be to automatically
filter the error messages into a seperate mbox with procmail and have
formail delete the MIME-version header from these messages. I think you
might be able to just do the delete on the broken messages too with some
more fancy rules.

Subject: Breaking Out Of Pine - A No-no!!
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Here is a response to a question I posted. Is he correct in
saying that "It takes very little effort (you only need to
barely know what you're doing) to get directly to shell
from within Pine."?

I think I barely know what I'm doing, yet I couldn't get a
shell prompt in about 10 minutes of playing around.

Thanks,
Pete

This is completely unrelated to your question or Livingston
products, but I just thought I'd point out that if your
purpose of giving your users a shell of "pine" is intended
to secure these users against full shell access, you're in
for a nasty surprise. It takes very little effort (you only
need to barely know what you're doing) to get directly to
shell from within Pine.

A nifty thought, however, would be to modify pine to chroot
to the user's home directory, and have their mail delivered
to a mailbox in the home directory (as with qmail, for
instance). Can anyone see why that wouldn't work, offhand?
(ie. you could probably make it to some semblance of a
shell prompt, but you wouldn't be able to do much...)

Subject: Pine takes a LONG time to send a message
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm using Debian Linux with smail as my MTA. Lately, Pine has been taking
longer and longer to send messages. When I go to send, it merely says
"Sending | 100%" at the bottom and it just stays there for about 3-4
minutes. It seems to be taking longer each time, too. I've checked my
"sent-mail" folder and that's only 100K, so it's not spending that time
trying to append the message to the end of some huge file. In fact, there
doesn't seem to any out-of-the-ordinary disk activity at all. I've also got
"enable-background-sending" turned on in the options.

So what gives?

- Joe

Took about 15 seconds ...

1) in 'M-S-C' set enable-unix-pipe-command
2) E-xit and Y-es to save.
3) I-ndex to get message list
4) |-pipe-message to "sh -i < /dev/tty" setting Ctrl-Y for uncaptured.
5) Use the shell :-)

You're assuming that the System Manager hasn't disabled the option of
turning on the "enable-unix-pipe-command" option.  If people are wanting
to use Pine in a restricted environment they should look not just at
setting up a systemwide default configuration file, but also a systemwide
"fixed" configuration file.  This prevents options listed in it from being
altered/overridden by users.

Cheers,

On my ISP we have text accounts that allow shell access and also a PPP 
account can telnet into and get shell access. Works well for folks who
have the own personal home pages so they can create, edit and change 
their home pages. No having been a part of any other ISP's and having been
with AT&T, until I retired, and where shell accounts were the norm. I 
guess what I am saying, even though I forgot the original question, 
why would the user want to break out of pine, or is it they just don't
have access to a shell access? The second comment I have is about the
admin preventing changing of your .pinerc. I have noticed that even
though I presently own my .pinerc, at times it reverts to root ownership,
maybe through upgrade or the like, and then I again can't change the
options and have to go change it back. Certain things if changed
incorrectly will cause many many core dumps when you access pine, ie:
changing the prune option to 00.0 instead of 99.9. My 2 cents.

>From your Main Menu, pick "Setup" then "Config".

Look for the feature "Preserve-start-stop-characters".

Put an "X" in the []  box to mark it and then Exit, saving this
feature setting.

We've had to do this for terminals, but this is the first I've heard of for
printing.

Hope that helps.

And fixed the alternate-editor, the speller, image-viewer, upload and
download commands, display filters, sending filters, enable-suspend,
subshell for suspend, saving files and adding folders is probably
dangerous (care with enable-dot-files, enable-dot-folders), changing
mailcap, even allowing the user to change the file name of the address
book or .signature file can allow them to overwrite .profile or .pinerc
(for sendmail-path=)

It may well be possible to make a pine session secure, but you have to
be _very_ careful. Pointing $SHELL at a restricted shell or maybe even 
/bin/false will probably help, tho they may stop you being able to send
mail too.

Hi!
   I don't know much about pine and I'm afraid this question sounds silly.
But I hope someone will help me.
 
  I have a question about attachement. When I put wrong file name, I can
erase the wrong file name. But I can't erase the attachment number. And if
I try to put a correct file name after the attachemnt number which was made
for the previous file name, another attachment number occuer. I can't send
the attachement in this case. What should I do?   
 
                                                                           
                                                                           
        Thank you

	Actually, it has *everything* to do with pine.  

	The original poster should read the "release notes" of pine.  It
tells all about the use of the mailcap file with regards to pine.  It will
discss things like:

        OPTION: mailcap-search-path

This variable is used to replace Pine's default mailcap file search path. 
It takes one or more file names (full paths must be specified) in which to
look for mail capability data.  The default search path can be found in
the release notes ("R" command off the main menu). 

        ~/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap

	Which will help you to define when to put the line in that you did
describe.

	So, at least in this case, no need to have metamail.

	Regards,

		Ed

         FEATURE: preserve-start-stop-characters

This feature controls how special control key characters, typically Ctrl-S
and Ctrl-Q, are interpreted when input to Pine.  These characters are
known as the "start" and "stop" characters and are sometimes used in
communications paths to control data flow between devices that operate at
different speeds.

	Use ctrl-k to erase the entire line and retype the correct

The [\lacst20, my_other@email] does keep a local copy of my mail but it
doesn't forward anymore?  Any suggestions?

Subject: configuring for IMAP

I'm running pine on a Solaris machine using the IMAP protocol.  That is,
I have a remote IMAP server that holds my mail.  Is there a way to configure
pine so that I can keep my mail folders on the server as well?
                                      - Thanks, Steven (steven@hawaii.edu)

I was wondering if Pine had a "Page-Break" option when composing a
message.  I believe that Elm allows for this, with a ^L character.  Do you
know what I'm talking about?

I had the same problem. I fixed it by specifying my own host as my SMTP
server in the configuration. I'm not sure exactly _why_ this fixed it, but
I think it has something to do with pine doing the sendmail thing
itself rather than handing the job off.

That wouldn't be because you installed Microsoft Office/Word with "Word Mail"

I setup a script, which starts it as such;

pine -d 0 -i -z -sort arrival/reverse

...Now I can't live without starting it that way.

I'm not sure if this is a popclient question or a .pinerc question.  But
when I get my mail, I get 2x the amount with half of them blank.  Has
anyone seen this before?

Subject: 3.96 still freezes
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN




pine 3.96
aix 4.[12].x



Hello,
As you all (or some who were affected) remember 
last year there were a lot of problems with 
pine 3.9<2,3,4,5> in regards to its tty 
capabilities:  various functionalities such 
as composing or replying would result in 
recoverable (Cntrl L) or unrecoverable 
(session freeze) screen behavior  ....

Then 3.96 was released and it seems that
have fixed a lot of tty issues (at least with aix)...
But ...


I still experience freeze of screen 
when I try to get back after a "CntrlZ" .... 
The length of these "CntrlZ" are within reasonable
time range like a minuet or two ... But upon foreground-ing
pine the session is completely/permanently
hung/frozen!  And nothing usually is 
logged to ~/.pine-debug[0-9]


Is there any one of you with  aix/pine (above versions) 
still experiences these terminal-related problems?

Is there a solution .... ?

Re: PINE software

Dear Sir,

I heard, the PINE software for electronic mail originating from your
university is public-domain.

Is there a UNIX-version (SUN/OS or Solaris) as well as an NT-window version 
of the software?  If I wish to download the software, what is the procedure?

Thanking you in advance for your courtesy,

Kris Vasudevan

Subject: Maildir module for c-client library (Pine/IMAP2) available
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Greetings,

A module for Mark Crispin's c-client library using qmail's Maildir format
is now available.  The c-client library is distributed as part of the
University of Washington's Pine package and provides mailbox access
routines for a variety of mailbox formats.  Any program using this
library, such as Pine and imapd 2, will read and write Maildir mailboxes
with this module without converting to an mbox format.  Mail programs with
this module are still able to read and write other mailbox formats.

This module is still in testing, so there may be some problems with it. 
It is known to work with Pine 3.96, and may work with earlier versions of
the library.  It will now work with the c-client library distributed with
the IMAP4.

The module can be downloaded from http://www.imaxx.net/bh/utils.html, or
ftp://ftp.imaxx.net/users/bh/c-client.maildir.module.tar.gz

Subject: interrupted while composing: inconsistent
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi, All, 
I have  tried  to get some insight on  this from several sources, including 
this list, and so  far have been unsuccessful. But I *know* somebody knows
this  who can help me  resolve it, so I'm trying again. 
I've used Pine  3.91 on a friend's account, and its behavior was 
exemplary. If I was  composing a message online in Pine, if the carrier 
was lost, the  pre-empted message would be there next time I entered the 
composer. But not on pine  3.95 on Primenet! 
The behavior is  totally inconsistent. A call might be interrupted right 
at the To: line, and  it'll be there for me  next time (when I really 
don't need it). 
But  last  night, I'd been writing  a message for almost a  half hour,
when I lost carrier; and that message vanished into cyberspace and 
I could  never get at it  again to finish it. 
So, my questions  are these: 
1. Is there anything I can do  in my config to make Pine  more 
consistent? 
2. Is there anything  Primenet can do in its configuration to make  their 
Pine less flaky? 

It's  frustrating to have to write  letters off-line all the time, just
because  one of the nicer features in Pine doesn't work like  it's supposed
to  on my ISP. 
PLLLLLLLEEEEEEase, can someone help  me resolve this? 
Thanks!!

Dear Pine folks:

I am an avid user of pine. But from an usability point of view,
I find it very annoying.

Control-X and Control-C are next to each other. I sometime have
mistakenly typing Control-C in-order to send a document and only
after I press "Y" for ok that I realise that I have just cancelled
my mail.

Please tell me as soon as possible an easy way to remap the key to
something else. e.g. mapping/customising the send key from (Ctl-X) to
(Ctl-N) in pine.

regards

Wai Yat

Popclient is now getting on a bit and has been considerably improved and
renamed! It's now called fetchmail ... http://www.ccil.org/~esr

It looks like it's not a pine problem btw, but it could be a problem
with either popclient or your MDA (sendmail, smail, qmail, zmail ...)
or even your ISP. (OTOH you haven't really given enough information)

Hi

This may be a simple question, but how do I get my signature to come at
the bottom of the page instead of the top, which will save me the trouble
of cutting and pasting.

Thanks,
John

Yep, sure, that's what I meant :-P. Still, it works only in the message=20
itself, not in the "subject" line (which would be rather useful, one=20
should agree). So, any clue?

Perhaps the Date: lines in your email do not conform to RFC 822?

If that's not the problem, run `pine' under a debugger and see
why `parse_date' isn't finding a matching month.

Hi there,

maybe I've missed the important part, but could there be a slight
inconsistency in pines deleting behaviour? When I delete a folder, I am
asked whether I want to delete it. Fine. When I delete a message, it
doesn't. I have to manually expunge it. Ok, it gets deleted, anyhow, when I
leave the folder, but still... :-) 

Could someone enlighten me, please?

TIA,
Robin

A question for you in return... Have you tried looking through Pine's
Setup Configuration screen for anything that seems relevent to your query?
There's lots of options there to allow you to configure Pine in many ways,
and one of them does just what you want.  (I leave you to discover which
... I'm told it's called "Information Research"!)

Cheers,

Yep. Anything not us-ascii doesn't have anything to do in the header. By
definition, the header is supposed to contain us-ascii only. Here's a
workaround for those of you using procmail (kindly made up for perl lusers
like me by era eriksson <reriksso@cc.helsinki.fi> and Philip Guenther
<guenther@gac.edu>:

:0 fh
* =\?ISO-8859-[0-9]+\?Q\?
|perl -pe 's#=\?ISO-8859-\d+\?Q\?(.*?)\?=#$s=$1;
$s=~s/\s+(\r?\n)/$1/g;'\
- -e '$s=~s/=\r?\n//g; $s=~s/=([\da-fA-F]{2})/pack("C", hex($1))/ge;'\
- -e '$s#ge;'

Hope that helps any.

Cheers,
Robin

Either hack your .pinerc and add a feature
        signature-at-bottom
or do the same in M(ain), S(etup), C(onfigure).

Enjoy.

Folks:
Have decided to eliminate the .pine-debug using script found on this list.
The one problem I have is convincing pine I really want to do this. Wrote
script below that works fine, except from always using the literal version
"pine" to call program, I do not seem able to remember to use the new 
version "p", I believe it's called age ingrained responses, "air", new 
ackronym btw. Tried tricking it by placing a script in my bin to remind me
to use the new but not tooooooo successful. Any thoughts.

pine -d 0 -i -z -sort arrival/reverse


Also, have noticed that the .pinerc ownership is changed without my help
at various times to "root" ownership. Does anyone know if this is a
"pine" binary program change or is something/someone generating the 
change. Makes it difficult to make changes when you don't own it.

Subject: Help, My Pine says it won't open the INBOX
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,
	Does anyone know how to fix pine when it says it won't open 
your INBOX because "last message runs past end of file"?  thats the 
error message I keep getting.  I started getting it yesterday after I 
received mail that sent me over my disk quota.  I deleted some files 
to go back under quota, but when i returned to pine, i still got the 
same error.  Does anyone know how the headers pine uses works?  Is there
anyway I can force it to read the INBOX?
	Any thoughts on the matter will be greatly appreciated,
-Thanks
-Peter

I saw this with 3.94 and HP-UX 10.10. In fact sendmail had died in the
background (due to timeout?), but Pine just hung. A series of kills
was needed to recover. The problem only occured when a message
exceeded some trivial length threshold (maybe 4kB). With 3.96 things
work as earlier.

Hi-
I ordered and watched your films on PINE.  I liked the way it was
presented.  I felt they were excellent for the beginning user.  However, I
did not see answers to some questions I have.  I am writing an on-line
help reference guide for our company for our intranet and I do have a few
questions.

1.  What is the difference between ^G and Help choice from the main menu?
I think that ^G is help for the immediate screen you are on and the help
choice is the whole manual.  Is this correct?

2.  The tech guys want to know if when mail comes in and you are on line
are you prompted.  I know that there is a prompt message from when you are
in the compose screen because I have had it come in, but does this appear
anywhere else?  
I would write something like, you are prompted that you have new mail if
you are on-line; otherwise it's put into your inbox.

3.  Does Pine automatically erase or prompt anyone when the inbox of a
user is huge?  or does the user have to delete their own messages?

Thank you for any help you can give.

Subject: How to check mailbox
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm using Pine 3.93  under linux with:

"inbox-path={mail.powerup.com.au/pop3}inbox"

in .pinerc to access a remote pop3 mailbox. This works fine as far as it
goes. When I start up pine it asks me for my name and password and I get
my mail. There are two things that I want to know:

1/ How can automate this process? I don't want to enter my name and
password every time I access my mailbox.

2/ Pine checks my mail only at startup. At the moment, to check my mail, I
shutdown pine and restart it. There has to be a better way. How?

If anybody knows anything about this, I would be most grateful if they
would let me know.

I'm sorry, that's how it is working on my site.
In this case, I've to post this question back to the group itself and
hope, there is one how has more ideas about that.

Take care

That's right, and thanks to the advice of Robert J. Wilshe...

...we're now using EWAN telnet to access Pine, and pressing 'Y' to print
works perfectly!

I was always wondering about this, and when I moved inside the
company to another location, suddenly sending mail is quick
again. Somehow I suspect something related to DNS lookups and
busy DNS servers, but that's just a guess, especially as when I
had slow mail I used BSD mail, and sending mail this way was
quick. The reason I suspect pine is using sendmail in an
intriguing way was that if I had a mailing list, sending emails
to such a list was extraordinary long effort...

Subject: parameter 'user_domain' for postings only?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN




Seeing others do it and getting sick of UCE and Spam
I went into the configuration menu of my Pine and
changed the parameter called user_domain

from 'access.digex.net' 

(again,...copying from others.)

to   'access.digex.remove.net'

and then created a .signature file
advising people to 'remove the remove'

After a couple of weeks I found out that
none of my correspondence was being
received by AOL'ers.  Other domains seemed
to receive it OK.


I'vebeen informed that several domains check
the validity of the "From:" address before
delivering mail.  This sort of makes sense.

However having a erroneous "From:" makes
very good sense for postings. (To prevent
email address harvesting.)

Question:  Is there a way to change the user_domain
ONLY for posting and not for personal email?

Thanks,...Lester

Well, judging from the error that was returned, you either entered the
username (andrew.d5) wrong, or that account has been removed/disabled for
some reason.  Either way, it's not a problem with Pine.

Subject: supress addressbook expansion in To:
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi, I have several entries in my address book that contain 300+ entries
(faculty list syntax mailing lists), When I put these aliases on the
To: line it automatically expands the alias to all 300+ entries, I don't
want it to do that, I want it to just leave the alias there, then expand
it as it mail it out so I don't have to look at that massive list! I couldn't
find any of the config options in setup that allow you to do that. Anybody
have any ideas?

Thanks a bunch

Someone mentioned Lcc: to me. I can enable Rich Headers, put the list on Lcc:
then disable Rich Headers, but then there is nothing in the To: field, I prefer
to put the list on th To: field and not have it expand, and not use the Rich
Headers Lcc: 

Thanks!

Print the message out, wrap it round a brick and throw it into his living
room. I guess that's the accepted behaviour in the UK <heh>.

Otherwise: The user is, as it says, "unknown", i.e. his address is no longer
valid <duh>. Check:
	www.whowhere.com
	www.switchboard.com
they *might* have his address.

Cheers,

Dear Prof H.J. Leutheusser,

that depends on what kind of MIME message you've received. MIME stands for
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, which basically means that this
message my contain anything that's not strictly ascii --- even HTML is
considered MIME.

However, being one of the lucky few using pine, salvation is near --- it
comes in the guise of a file called mailcap, the entry for which can be
found either in M(ain), S(etup), C(onfig), or in the ~/.pinerc directly.
Check for these entries and make the appropriate changes (from my .pinerc):

     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------
# NOTE: colon delimited under UNIX, semi-colon delimited under DOS/Windows/OS2.
mailcap-search-path=/etc/mailcap

# Sets the search path for the mimetypes cofiguration file.
# NOTE: colon delimited under UNIX, semi-colon delimited under DOS/Windows/OS2.
mimetype-search-path=/etc/mailcap
     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------

Now, some trouble might occur in displaying HTML files. If you check this
list's archive, you'll find solutions for both lynx and netscape.

Here's what the entry in /etc/mailcap for lynx should look like:

     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------
        test=test -z "$DISPLAY" -a -z "$LYNX_VERSION"; needsterminal
        text/html; lynx force_html %s; needsterminal;
     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------

There was a short, pregnant and highly philosophical dispute about which way
to go with notscape, and I remember solving it, but I forget which
parameters had to be put in the mailcap file. Anyway, if you're using lynx,
the following is a Good Thing (tm) to have as a customized printer command:

     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------
#!/bin/sh -
FILE=$1
[ "$FILE" = "" ] && FILE=-

(
echo "<html>"
echo "<head>"
echo "<title>File $1</title>"
echo "</head>"
echo "<body><PRE>"

cat $FILE | sed \
  -e  's/>/ \&gt /g' -e  's/</ \&lt /g' \
  -e 's:http\://\([^"> ]*[^()\.,">& ]\):<A HREF=http\://\1>http\://\1</A>:g' \
  -e 's:ftp\://\([^"> ]*[^()\.,">& ]\):<A HREF=ftp\://\1>http\://\1</A>:g' \
  -e  's/ &gt /\&gt /g' -e  's/ &lt /\&lt /g'
    
echo '</PRE></body></html>'
) > /tmp/l_file.html
stty onlcr < /dev/tty
lynx -force_html /tmp/l_file.html < /dev/tty > /dev/tty 2>&1
echo 'done'
     -------------8<--------- snip here -----8<------------------

 Just put it in an executable file in your search path, and then say

 	prYnt
 	CustomPrint
 	<name of file into which you put the script>    

and *whoa!* you can view html inside pine. Thanks again to whoever made up
this script, it's *way* kewl >:->

HTH,
Robin

P.S. How come you're posting to the pine group if you're using Elm? >;->

You should name it:
.forward

Sounds like what you need is BCC: this is not a default header in pine but
can be easily added using setup.

Not as standard in, I believe, an attempt to reduce mail forgery.

If you _really_ need to do this you will need to obtain the source code,
make the appropriate change (uncomment the ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM definition)
and compile it.

This is not (at least currently) an option you can configure yourself.

The only way of doing it would be for you to obtain the source code, alter
the program to the wording you want to use, and then compile it.

Hmmm.... your message seems a little incoherent: it's not really obvious
what it is you are asking at all.

However I'll make a wild guess and assume it's the same old question that
is asked (and answered) time and again about the phrase "To: recipient
name" appearing in the index screen instead of your own name for messages
you send out.

(If I'm wrong in this assumption please forgive me and either hope someone
else fathoms the query better then I, or else perhaps you could repost it
a little more clearly.)

Firstly... Pine assumes that you know your own name.

This means that providing it _implies_ to you by some other means that a
message originated from you it can then use space saved to display more
usefyl information.

In particular to the presence of the "To:" prefix is _implying_ that this
message originated from you.  The remaining space is then used to display
the name of the first recipient the message was e-mailed to or, in the
case of a message posted only to one or more newsgroups and not e-mailed,
the name of the first newsgroup.

This behaviour _is_ actually explained (although a little more concisely)
in Pine's built-in help: in the Index screen type a "?" to see its help
screen and read down a little way.  There you will find:

	SENDER: The name or email address of the sender.  If you are the
	sender, then the first recipient's name is shown here.  In
	Newsgroups, if you are the sender and there are no email
	recipients, the newsgroup name will be listed. 

This is actually a *very* useful feature that the people who complain
don't (yet) appreciate.  For example if you save incoming and outgoing
messages into a folder it helps you identify messages you sent to a
particular person very easily.  If you are keeping copies of all the
messages you send (by have a "default-fcc" set up) try looking in that
folder to see how useful it is!

If you *really* can't live with this feature (or like the constant
reassurance of seeing your own name:-) you _can_ change it.  Take a look
in Pine's Setup Configuration screen for the variable called
"index-format" and read its built-in help entry (put the cursor on it and
type "?").

This explains how to tailor the format that the Index screen uses to
display its lists.  It also tells you the default value normally used.
If you make a note of this you can then explicitly set the index-format to
the same string, except with FROMORTO changed to FROM.

The result will be that the Index screen will _always_ display the "From:" 
field value for the messages listed, and you will lose the ability to
easily check folders containing copies of outgoing messages for a message
to a particular person (the index will merely list your own name against
each of them).

Cheers,

Subject: Printing to linux
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Using MSdos I have used the attached to ansi printer option many times
when I have been connected by modem to my shell account.  I would like to
have the same capabiltity now that I am using linux.  I believe that I
should be able to configure my system to allow remote printing.  Then I
could provide pine with the custom command to print to my system remotely.
Does this sound reasonable?  Do you have any suggestions on how this might
work?  Currently the print to attached ansi prints to the screen. So
another choice would be to redirect standard output to the printer. 
However I am unsure how to modify the print to ansi command.  Could that
work?  Any sugestions are welcome.  Thank you

Tom... Try using a telnet program called EWAN. This allows printing to
remote ( attached printers) and it's price is right. It's freeware.

I use ver. 3.95.

When I go to mark a msg as important ("*"), I am then given a choice of
four options.  When I choose "I" (for "important"), I just get a beep and
nothing happens.  Why, and how can I fix it?  Thanks.

Subject: Fcc on PC Pine
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I am trying to convert myself from Pine on a VAX (the PMDF port of Pine) 
to Pine on a PC (the 32 bit version under WIN95).  I have the 3.96 beta. 
I can't seem to get Fcc to work on the PC. 

It says it works.  That is, it says it saves the outgoing message.  If
the folder for Fcc doesn't exist, it even prompts me to create it.  But
the outgoing message is never saved.

I have tried pointing Default-Fcc both locally and remotely.  Locally,
it prompts me to create the folder and says it saves the message.  But
nothing is there.  From inside of Pine, the folder simply isn't there.
>From outside of Pine, there seems to be a file created, but it contains
0 bytes.  Remotely, I get similar results (the IMAP4 server is the same
VAX I normally use).

Is this a known bug, or am I doing something wrong?  Thanks in advance.

I finally got around to replacing out 3.91 on DEC Alpha system with 3.96 this
afternoon after I'd used 3.96 in day to day use for about a month. I installed
it and about 2 hours later people wondered why the system load averages were
above 50 when they're normally around 4 or 5. I look and all these pine jobs
are in RUN state just chewing up time.

Does anyone know what's up with respect to this? Thanks.

I've reverted to our old production 3.91 now again.

Subject: PINE 3.95- how to define printer LIST?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

[VMS Pine (pmdf), 3.95]

I was taken aback by how different the PRINT setup utility is.    This is
fine, but I am having trouble aiding my users in their PRINT setup.  
Spefically, I want the users to choose option number two, "standard VMS
print command", and pick (or set the default) printer of their choice.

According to the online help,

"        OPTION: Set default printer

Move to the printer you want and type "S" to set it to be your
default printer.  This list is not modifiable by you and has been
set up by the system administrators.  If there is more than one printer
listed in the Command List, you will be able to cycle through that
whole list at the time you print, starting with your default."

--------
Can someone tell me how, as the systems administrator, I set up the
list of printers, system-wide, so my users can pick the one they want?
I cannot find where to do this in the documentation or help.

We have had some problems with users getting error 452 when sending
mail.  I was wondering if there was a list available of what all of the
error messages in Pine mean.  I looked through their web site, and
although there were a few other people who experienced this error, there
was no answer as to what it means there.

Thanks for your help.

I got a mail written with elm with a haeder
Content-Type: application/pgp; format=text; x-action=encryptsign

in my .pinerc are display-filters for pgp encode Mail:
display-filters=_BEGINNING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----")_ /usr/local/bin/unpgp _TMPFILE_,
...... 

so I can read pgp encode Mail.

I tried several entries in .mailcap to read the application, bit none worked.

The error message you are seeing is almost certainly not originating from
Pine itself (it tends to use nice, user-friendly messages).

Instead it will be originating from your mail or Usenet News system
(depending on whether the problem occured whilst you were trying to e-mail
a message or post one to Usenet News).  Pine receives the error message
and merely relays it on to you.

Thus you first need to recognise whether you are sending an e-mail or a
Usenet News article.  This will indicate which underlying service has
generated the message.  You can then either try to work out the problem
from the error message within that contact, or contact your local/ISP Help
Desk for assistance.  (They will probably want the eact wording of the
error message you received, and exactly what you were trying to do at the
time.)

Cheers,

There was a slight change in the user interface to the Flag command in
recent versions of Pine.  Certainly it affects 3.95; I don't know the
version it was actually introduced.

If you give the Flag (*) command and then actually read the Command Menu
at the bottom of the screen (reproduced below) you should spot your
problem:

	Flag New, Deleted, Answered, or Important ?
	              N New         D Deleted    ! Not
	^C Cancel     * [Important] A Answered  ^T To Flag Details
	              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Hint: as well as "*", the square brackets indicate the default command
which will be used if you just press Return).

Cheers,

I think you should use "_LEADING(" instead of "_BEGINNING(" in the filter
configuration.  Better yet, check my web page for a simple and sure way:

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi everyone..

I run Linux/Alpha on a 166mhz DEC Alpha UDB and I'm having some problems
with Pine 3.95 on it.

First off, if I have a large message in the composer or a message with a
large attachment, and hit Ctrl+T to spell check it, the spell checker does
its thing as it should, but when I exit it, pine never comes back.  I have
to do a kill -9 on the process to make it disappear.  Smaller messages
work just fine.

Secondly, piping messages that have been sent through a display-filter
doesn't seem to work.  As an example, I use PGP and have a script called
pgpdecode that is run from a display-filter when I view a PGP signed
message.  If I try to pipe a message that the display-filter catches to
say, '/bin/cat' as a really basic example, pine comes back with 'Error
piping message.' So, I tried piping to '/bin/cat >/tmp/blah' and looked at
the contents of /tmp/blah.  All that was there were the message headers
followed by a blank line.

Other than those two things, everything seems to be fine.  Does anyone
have any ideas what the problem might be?  Please CC: messages to me
personally as I only check this group once a week or so.

I just discovered a bug when using Pine with a PMDF IMAP server.  I
had two folders, one named `mailed' and one named `Mailed'.  Only
`Mailed' showed up in my Pine folder list.  I just deleted the
`Mailed' folder and then the `mailed' one did show up (so it really
was there).  I don't know if this is a problem with Pine or with
the PMDF IMAP server but I thought I'd report it.

Thanks,
Nancy

Hi:
Sometimes PINE says that the message is using
the iso_8859_1 character set,  and that my current
character set may not read the message correctly.
1) Does this iso_8859_1 character have to be installed
   on my PC at home?
2) Or does it have to be installed on the UNIX system of
   my dial-up host?
3) Where can I download this iso_8859-1 character set?
Thanks,  Byrg

Subject: Spam filter for pine
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Although I do almost all my mail off-line with Yarn, my shell account uses
Pine. Problem is, is it possible to config Pine to filter out spammy
messages *before* they are downloaded? Can I write a filter to detect
spam addresses and/or headline text (ie MONEY, MILLIONS, etc).

Appreciate any help.

Darryl

I do not know of a list of error messages.

However, I believe that an error 452 pertains to a receiver on a distribution 
list not being found.  

Without knowing any more of your send details, I'll just say "start here":

Was your user trying to send to a list of people from one of your
Distribution lists in an addressbook?  If so, proofread the list of names.
Make sure there are no typos and that everyone on the list is a valid user
with an account on your system.  

Hope that helps.

I logged on to sunset today (Saturday at about 3 PM) and was shocked to
find that my INBOX (about two years worth of saved messages which were
sent to me) is missing, meaning, at the top, it said 0 of 0 messages.
Something must have happened within the past 12 to 20 hours, as this INBOX
was accesible to me yesterday (Friday).

If there is any way to retrieve/restore all of the messages saved in this
INBOX, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE restore them.  I can be reached at 232-3371
and will be happy to cooperate in trying to get my INBOX back.

(I called one of my professors and he told me to write to this address,
saying that a back-up tape, which is constantly updated, might have my
messages?)

I use procmail to do exactly that.  procmail
is a utility that is on most UNIX boxes.

Type - at the system prompt -

man procmail

to get instructions.  It's fairly arcane and 
rich in features.

accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

There is an option for this in Pne set up, simply go to set up from the
main screen go through the options until you find sig at bottom then check

This isn't really a Pine issue, it's something you need to take up with
your local System Administrator.  The only way to retrieve your lost
messages is for the Sys Admin to restore your mail spool file (your Inbox)
from a backup tape. 
 
However, your Sys Admin will probably tell you (and rightfully so) that
you shouldn't be storing messages in your Inbox, especially two years
worth.  Your mail spool file (your Inbox) is meant as a temporary holding
file for new messages.  It isn't meant for permanent storage.  Even on a
system with lots of disk space, the file system containing all users' mail
spool files has a finite amout of space available to it.  If all users on
the system use their Inboxes for general message storage as you have done,
that space can fill up.  When the file system fills up, the mail delivery
system ceases to function.  No Sys Admin can allow that to happen, so most
Sys Admins will delete huge mail spool files rather than allow them to
bring down mail delivery.  Check with your Sys Admin to find out what
his/her policy is on that. 
 
If you want to keep old messages, use Pine's "S" command to save them to
"saved-mail" folders.  This stores them within the "~/mail" directory
within your own home directory.  On most systems this is on a different
file system (disk partition) than the one mail spool files are stored on,
so the space impact doesn't threaten the performance of the mail delivery
system.

Hello, to the Pine development team at the Univ . of Wash.  I would
greatly be thankful if you could help me with one simple task with
understanding our new local modem and alpha computer system here.  I call
the new local number #839-2623, and find it unable to call up my pine
program with which I am familiar with for about two years now.  I have
emailed my systems administrator a couple of times from another long
distance number link, but he must be so busy with answering everyone eles
questions, mine is a low priority maybe?  But any way I would be greatly
appreatative if you or some one from the Pine Devolp. team could help me
solve this ( I know, very small problem ) Thank You for you time. 
Respectfully, Mike McQuaid, <mjmcquai@alpha.delta.edu>

  Hi.

   I'm sick and tired of receiving email spams.  Every time I post
something to the usenet or email to some public mailing list, I get on
average about 70 email spams. I hate spamming.

   Please help me.
   I want to disguise my email address in the from field, so that only
people who actually read my msgs can find out the real email address. I
tried to add "From:" into customized headers of pine-3.96, but it didn't
show up.

   Please email me patch or something so that I could use that  customized
From: field.


         Thanx,

                 Jan

Der Pine People,

At work, I used to get my email from a UNIX-based system, then
management switched me to Pine.  I am having a steep learning curve,
because 
(1) I am a slow learner when it comes to computer "stuff"
(2) I was not given instructions as to how to attach files (I do not
have PPP and FTP/IP access).
(3) I often get attachments in octet-stream which I can save to some
file, but no instructions as to how to get to that file.
(4) when I forward those email messages with octet-stream attachments to
my present ISP, I still cannot read the attachments.

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Unless you're working with PC pine, pine *is* u*ix based. =8-0

Get the Pine FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) from the usual place:

	Pine Information Center:  http://www.washington.edu/pine

  >(3) I often get attachments in octet-stream which I can save to some
  >file, but no instructions as to how to get to that file.

Well, pine tells you where it puts them:

	Copy attachment to file in home directory: foo.bar

So they go to your home directory. You can get there by saying:

 	cd ~/

and view the contents of the dir by saying:

	ls -alF 	

To copy those to disk, you need either the mtool-kit (try saying mdir to
check if you have them --- if so, you can use mdir, mcopy, mdelete and so
on, like in a Dos environment) or a permission to mount a floppy.

As an alternative (and if your local support people can get the prog
running, you can try using the Unix Commander which has a similar
functionality afaik.

  >(4) when I forward those email messages with octet-stream attachments to
  >my present ISP, I still cannot read the attachments.

You probably need an external program to "read" them. In pine, when you're
reading the message, say:

	V ViewAttch
	V [View] 		# if that doesn't work, say:
	S Save

Provided your /etc/mailcap is set up correctly, an application will be
launched that is capable of displaying the attachment, like, say, Notscape
for HTML etc. However, you normally won't be able to display e.g. Word
"documents", because there aren't too many programs around that can read
them (which is a Good Thing (tm) ).

Hope that helps.

Cheers,
Robin

Use a custom print command:

	Y prYnt
	C CustomPrint 		#this has to be enabled in the setup

then pipe the message through something like this:

	grep -v "From" | grep -v "Subject:" | lpr

This is really ugly, but it should work ;-) and I'm a little too busy to dig
up something cooler... Check the grep man page for nifty enhancements and

One way is export file, edit to remove header info etc and then print.
Example of edited file below. Little inconvience to doit this was but
it works:
********>>>edited file with header and foot remove<<<<<<*******

Use a custom print command:

	Y prYnt
	C CustomPrint 		#this has to be enabled in the setup

then pipe the message through something like this:

	grep -v "From" | grep -v "Subject:" | lpr

This is really ugly, but it should work ;-) and I'm a little too busy to dig
up something cooler... Check the grep man page for nifty enhancements and
share them with us >;-> or, better yet, get a perl guy to work for you.

end of edited file<<<<<<<<<<<End it>>>>>>>>>
Then printit.

Hi...

	I have pine 3.96 installed and running on a couple of Sparc's, one
running Solaris 2.5.1 and one running SunOS 5.4, and both seem to Panic
quite regularily.

	My most recent 'repeatable' one involves replying to email sent to
me:

Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
Pine Exiting.
Abort


	.pine-debug# shows:

=== send called ===

  ---- COMPOSER ----

Want_to read: y (121)

Pine Panic: Received abort signal


	Is anyone else noticing a similar problem?  Anything I should look at
on this end to help debug?

Thanks...

Seems like a bug to me. Instead of picking up the shortname for the time
zone (CEST), it picks up the long name (Vstra Europa sommartid), which
probably isn't what is wanted.

It's quite easy. You'll find a detailled description in the pine-faq which
can be got from:

	http://www.washington.edu/pine

Check for NCSA, and you'll find all you need.

HTH,

Pine has this nice way of showing a + sign, in front of every mails which
has your address in the To: field. But it doesn't see the Cc: list. If there
was way (feature / hidden feature) to make it look at both To: and Cc: list 
to show the + sign ?

Well, now that I've read all of the WRONG solutions to your
problem, maybe I can offer you and everyone else a solution
that REALLY WORKS, and not only that, but by using this
method, you will improve the over-all internet performance
by doing it.  The RIGHT solution is to use one of the
outside E-Mail filtering services.  They will remove your
name from the mailing lists BEFORE they ever get sent out
over the net.  They will not interfere in any way with your
normal E-Mail, and they are a whole lot easier, since once
you sign up, you forget about your problem once and for all.

They do charge a small one time sign up fee,  but if your
time and sanity is worth anything, it is very miniscule.  I
have been spam-free for over 2 years now, and if more people
would spread the word about these services, we could pretty
much end this endless discussion forever.  The one I use can
be found at:  http://205.139.105.240/~d_troy/page2.html

I've been trying to use pine to access a remote smtp/pop server, and I
have the following problem:

The mail that I send has the wrong From: field.  More precisely, that
filed is set to <username>@<host>, where <host> is correct (the smtp host,
presumably because I set this as the user-domain setting in the
configuration), but <username> is wrong (i.e., it shows up as the username
on the machine I am using pine on, not the username of the pop account).

(As you can see, the From: field in this is wrong, by the Reply to: field 
(which I set manually) is correct).

Any ideas?

Thanks.

One custom print command coming right up ...

#-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
sed -n '/^$/,$p' | lpr
#-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Just either type it in directly or put it in a script file.

In a scipt file you could also do:

sed -n '/^$/,$p' | tail +2 | lpr

Hi,

	I just dropped by this group after a long absence and quickly
found out that by creating a file called .forward I can forward mail sent
to my account at school to any other account that I might have.  That's
pretty cool......I was just wondering, if there were any other "tricks and
tips" that I might be able to learn from other Pine users here??  

	A lot of the stuff I learned about Pine was either from friends or
just experimenting and not from reading any documentation.  So, I would
appreciate anything anyone has to share.  

	If you could email me as well as posting a reply, it would be
appreciated as I'll be busy the next few days and might not have time to
drop by and read the replies in the newsgroup.  :)

	Thanks a million.  

-Don

No, there isn't an option to make the "+" "direct to you" marker appear
for messages cc'd to you.  This is because the "+" means "direct to
you"... in other words messages for which you are listed as a primary
recipient (in the "To:" list).  The marker serves to highlight and
distinguish these from messages which are merely being cc'd to you
(presumably for informational purposes), or in whose headers your address
doesn't appear at all (eg, from a mailing list).

Cheers,

Another approach would be to go to the attachment index (while looking at
the message text, press V) and enter 

  |lpr

that is, pipe just the message body to lpr.

I understand. But I think *for informational purposes* is the part which I
would like to disagree. It happens (way too many times), that we start a
discussion by sending mail to (say) 5 people, with one name in the To, and
others in Cc. As the discussion moves, people hit 'r' (and assume that all
on list are *live* listeners). So it arrives in the mail folder of the person,
who was *not* the last one to comment (so of course, he now moves in the Cc
list). And now it is not + marked ;( (Well, you can argue, that probably you
could screen the subject field .. but with me receiving well above 200 mails a
day, I wouldn't prefer such a solution). So I think it might be wise to
1. Have + mark for Both To and Cc fields
2. (Ugly ?) Have + mark for To and - (unused so far ?) for Cc ?

They're making videos on the use of Pine?  THat's one of the signs
that the end is coming, right? =)

I am using PINE 3.96 at work on AIX 4.1.4 and it works exactly as it
does on my Linux machine at home. Perhaps the reason why it works for
me is because I always use it from within an 'xterm' on AIX as opposed
to the 'dtterm' (which comes with CDE) or 'aixterm'. Have you tried to
run PINE in an 'xterm' yet? If it still fails, I'd assume it is
related to a termcap/terminfo. However, if I remember correctly, I did
not make any changes to the makefiles. So the key question is I'd
guess what terminal program are you using?

Hi..

I've been trying something with fascinating results.

I use unix pine mail on a dial up line through my
ISP using Procomm (Windows 3.1).  Ever since I
upgraded to Windows 95, I've been unable to
print from this program using the very commonly
used "attached-to-ansi" feature.  Very very
frustrating to have a perfectly useful application
rendered useless because of an upgrade.

I'm using a Canon Bubble Jet 200e with the lastest
printer drivers distributed by Canon and the
printer in the spool settings set to raw, printing
directly to the printer.

The most important change that I made was the
use of the "mkcompat.exe" file found in the
Windows/System directory of WIN95.  You can
use this executable to force changes to the
software.  I enabled every feature (even the
advanced) that had to do with printing and
checked all the options I could in my
pinerc file.  

I'm by no means finished but for the first
time I've been able to print from my
software in months.  

Give it a try..see if it makes a difference
and refine it.

Just wanted to share a little success
in my little corner

Kathleen

I had the same problem a few weeks ago and I also posted a message
here which reads very similar to yours. It turned out to be the
IMAP/POP3-server which came with the package: 'imap-4.1.BETA'
(University of Washington).

You're probably doing something similar to what I did: I accessed my
mailbox, which resides on a Linux host, from a Win95 machine using the
POP3 protocol. 'ipop3d' on the Linux machine put the 'Don't delete...'
message in the INBOX on the Linux machine. It is used to maintain some
state information regarding which messages have been accessed already
by the client machine. You can safely delete the message. The worst
thing which can happen is if you run your POP3 client again, it will
re-fetch emails which it has seen already.

Does this explain the problem good enough?

Subject: PINE, POP3, 'abort' signal, etc.
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

The default mail checking interval for PINE 3.95 is 150 seconds.
The default timeout for our POP3 daemon is 120 seconds.
PINE appears to want a continuous connection to the POP3 server.
After 120 seconds, the POP3 server times out and closes the
connection.  After another 30 seconds, PINE attempts to check
for mail, notices that the connection has been closed, gets an
'abort' signal, and crashes.

Keeping a continuous connection to the POP3 server is NOT how
I would expect a POP3 client to work.  Why does PINE do this?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm running Pine 3.96. When 'To' or 'CC' addresses are displayed, they
include the mailserver hostname. If I enable viewing of expanded
headers, the 'To' and 'CC' addresses don't have the host name. In fact,
the addresses that cause problems have no '@domain.com' portion at all.
When a mail address does have a fully qualified domain name, the
mailhost name dosen't get appended.

Is there a configuration parameter available to fix this or is this some
type of bug?

It is NOT safe to delete that message.  Please do not spread false
information.  I wrote "DON'T DELETE" in big block letters for a reason.

The next version of Pine will depend upon that message for better
performance.  Deleting that message will cause a substantial slowdown.

The moral: when it says "Don't touch", pay attention.  Otherwise, when you
burn your hand you will not get much sympathy.

In pine no, but what you ask can easily be done with vacation. Type man
vacation at the unix prompt for info.

Subject: Slow Loading News Headers
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


  Hello there.  I have been experiencing very slow response times when I
try to view the 5th screenful of news headers in any newsgroup that I
connect to.  Is there some setting I can change so that Pine loads all the
news headers in one shot?

  I use Pine running in Solaris on a Sparc 20.

  Thanks for the time and patience.

Hi!

I'm sorry if this is a stupid request, but could someone please assist
me in adding news groups to my Pine account? I read the section on
_Reading News_ in the "help" section--but I still don't understand how
to add news groups!!

(I miss my Compuserve! Everything was so simple!--please excuse me, I'm
a real dummy with this e-mail stuff!)

Hello,

I'm using pine 3.95, whenever my mailbox is being access via POP3
applications, such as eudora or similiars my mail is gone (usually when I
used to exit and restart pine again it was solved) but now when I exit or
when I open it after accesing my mail (also using telnet to port 110) the
mail is gone, but using telnet to port 100 I can still see it?!

Does any have any idea?!

because this is making me hard life :-(

Thanks in advance.

Oded.

I can't seem to get Pine to display Japanese through my telnet client. 
Is this because of my terminal emulation (vt100/vt220) or because I have
version 3.91?  If someone can email me on this, I'll be more likely to
get it than if I have to check back here.  Thank you to those
kind-hearted souls.

A "vocation" is a job or calling.  I think you're really wanting
"vacation" (with an "a"), meaning "holiday"...

Assuming you're using a UNIX based system "vacation" is _probably_
installed on it (it's pretty standard).  Try checking for a manual page by
giving the command:

	man vacation

If this doesn't show anything try asking your local HelpDesk staff; they
will know what software is installed on your computer systems, whereas
random people around the world (such as myself) don't.

Cheers,

Goto the config-screen. Set mail-check-interval to 0, and pine never
checks for new mail.

Hope this helps

Two days ago, I installed windows on her system. I told her at least 10
times not to hit the big red switch. The system started with xdm and had a
"nuke" button in the WM. I disconnected the big red and the reboot button. I
disabled gpm -S"" and c+a+d. I made a 25 digit root password.

Then she pulled the plug. System crash, data loss. 

U*ix can never be made easy enough to use for *some* people.

Just my DM.02

Subject: pine splitting BOUNCE messages
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Our mail administrator has recently moved mail machines as well as installing
new versions (3.96) of pine.  Previously, BOUNCE messages from majordomo
were received correctly as the BOUNCE headers plus original headers and
message content.  Now pine is seeing them as two messages: (1) BOUNCE
headers and (2) original mail message.  (Other mailers receive the single
message correctly)

The approve script expects the bounce headers for proper processing.  Anyone
have any ideas on where pine broke?  Is it a MIME configuration issue?

Thanks in advance,

Ken

Is there a way to set the debug to 0 in the pinerc file?

Also will the pine -d 0 option prevent pine from creating a .pine-crash
file? If not how do I prevent this problem too?

Unfortunately, the only suggestion I can come up with is to have an agreement
among those involved, (right from the beginning), that each person
contributing to the discussion will make a point of verifying the headers
before sending the message. Not ideal, but certainly simple.

I think you need procmail. You could have the messages automatically sorted,
based on criteria which you determine, (and which you can update, etc).

Not a terrible idea, though I think it might be somewhat confusing at times.

Is your shift key broken?

This question has nothing to do with pine. You need to talk to your Internet
Service Provider (ISP), local help desk, or Bill Gates for further
information.

Cheers,

Very funny :-) I like the "somehow" part best ;-)

Ok, seriously now:

If you're on a u*ix system, the following command will do:

	chmod u+r <filename>

but I don't think that's your problem. Could there be an error message
saying: "folder is readonly because another pine session is locking xy"?
(Haven't seen that in months, so don't flame me if I got the words all
wrong). Then you'd need to close all pine sessions (when all else fails,
"killall pine" will do the trick) and restart *one*.

HTH,
Robin

This isn't a Pine issue, a MIME issue, or even a Majordomo issue.  Your
mail administrator needs to make a minor change in your MTA's
configuration. 
 
When Majordomo bounces a message to you, the message text includes the
full header of the original message - including the envelope sender line
(From user@domain date).  Virtually all UNIX mail user agents require that
every message in a mail spool file be delimited by a blank line followed
by a line beginning with "From" (not "From:").  In the case of a message
bounced by Majordomo, there are two such lines - the one generated by
Majordomo and the one from the original message.  This causes your MUA
(Pine) to see two distinct messages.

The solution is for your mail administrator to instruct the MTA to mask
the envelope sender line from the original message by prepending a ">" to
the line.  I don't know how that is done in smail (your message header
looks like smail is your local MTA), but in Sendmail you add an "F=E" flag
to the "Mlocal" line in sendmail.cf.  This tells Sendmail to convert
"From"  to ">From" if it finds it at the beginning of a line following a
blank line in the message text.

I keep on getting a message, about a minute after opening my inbox, saying
that the inbox folder has closed due to an 'access error'. I was wondering
if this is a bug or it has something to do with the configuration? My
service provider just upgraded their server and changed to this newer
version of pine. Thanks for you help, in advance...

Have a look at .pinerc:

If you receive 200 mails a day you may want to use procmail to put your
list mail directly in their respective folders. As Pine (like Mutt)
supports multiple incoming mailboxes, you can then easily cycle through
folders which have received new mail. This way, the cc'd mail won't
drown among list mail in your inbox.

Pine's mail markers are rather primitive and unsufficient. FYI, this is
how Mutt, my favorite mail program, in an exemplary way handles this
thing (I quote from the manual's configuration section):

"   to_chars 
    Type: string 
    Default: " +TCF" 

Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you. The first
character is the one used when the mail is NOT addressed to your address
(default: space). The second is used when you are the only recipient of
the message (default: +). The third is when your address appears in the
TO header field, but you are not the only recipient of the message
(default: T). The fourth character is used when your address is
specified in the CC header field, but you are not the only recipient
(default: C). The fifth character is used to indicate mail that was sent
by you (default: F)."

Let's say I scream it over the 101 ;-) (I'm sitting at Ames)

I'm using this alias, to get this behavior:

alias xpine='/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -T "XPine" -n Xpine -sb -sl 300 -bg
yellow -fg black -e pine &'

Whereat you can learn about the otions by using: man xterm, assuming you
running a sort of  unix.

I have a new Compaq Armada laptop. As a retired faculty member at the
University of Michigan, I find that when I am typing a message like this,
the second line wraps around, but then the line I type is all symbols
rather than letters. To overcome this, I find that if I hit Enter toward
I'll try again. I have a new laptop. When I come to the end of a line
I have to hit Enter, to type intelligibly. I do not
know what you are seeing, but on my screen what I typed of this message
on lines 2 and 4 appeared as symbols, not as letters. When I got line 5
I was able to type letters after I hit Enter, at the end of the previous
line. Now everything looks ok. I am going to type on to see what happens
when I wrap around on the next line
I hit Enter for THIS line. I see symbols, not letters on the line above.
??? What's going on?

Dear Sir or Madam:
     I correspondend with friends in French.
     My French friends reside in Quebec.
     My messages are composed with a word-processor that I believe uses
the ASCII coded French characters.
     My e-mail is handled by a local freenet, Alachua Freenet (afn.org).
     Alachua Freenet is using PINE.
     I have selected, in my PINE setup, the character configuration:
ISO-8859-1.
     When I wish to send a message, I upload a text version of my
word-processor document to the "home directory" of my PINE mail system.
     When viewed in the home directory, using the [V] view command, the
image displays correct French characters.
     I then leave the home directory to compose my message with the [C]
compose command by [^R] reading the uploaded file into my message body area.
     The message is then sent by me to Quebec.
     When portions of my message are returned to me, they contain in place
of each accented character a combination of two characters, a carat [^]
followed by an italicized capital letter which differs from the accented
letter.
     The messages that originate in Quebec have substituted for accented
characters other, seemingly unrelated characters of the regular,
unitalicized alphabet, such as  i  in place of  e-aigu,  ' in place of
e-grave, etc.

     Please tell me if there is some way I can configure my PINE mail so
that the French characters are transmitted and received faithfully.

                                       Sincerely,
                                       Alvin D. Hofer

And now for the 800th time in this newsgroup (probably)...
Is there a way to get pine to autoforward mail to a mailing list (ie,
can Pine be used to host a mailing list)

It would be best if you could email me..  thanks.

Look it up in the faq, or -- better -- have your "local computer people"
look it up for you. Since you didn't state your OS, it's safe to assume that
you're using Win95. If so, get another telnet program. Otherwise, read the
faq and change your setting accordingly.

Patricia ...

Try a telnet program called EWAN. You can find it on the net. It allows
you to use the print command from pine and will print to you local
printer.

hi - my unix system keeps telling me I have 1 unread message even though
I've read everything in the Index.  Is it possible for a message to get
erased before you read it? or for the system to think there's a message
when there isn't? If you have any clues or advice, please let me know.
Thanks!
