Check this instead:
<http://www.dejanews.com>
And while being at yahoo!, you should have browsed the software
corner, because that's where the converters are.

No. You didn't state what operating system you're using and if you've

Send more details, then we might be able to help. Note also that this

Are you using "pine" as your email program?  From what I can see....it
seems "not".

	Friends:

	I am curious to know if Pine or Pico editing software will
	work in a Lynx page, or maybe in a Unix server.  I am using
	a Macintosh LC at 6.0.8 with a Supra* 144LC modem at home
	with generally perfect emulation, at least off prime time,
	in AzTeC's "Chet's Editor" right now.  I also have an
	account <125790.ef.smc.maricopa.edu> which is functional
	access to IRC, but currently disabled for unknown reason
	to send e-mail in.  System administrators at SMC are re-
	luctant to say anything about their WWW connection, and
	AzTeC Computing apparently assumes most of the local load.

	My home screen comes from straight Kermit "Q" turnaround
	with 512 bit packages, and the Supra with no Netscape.
	The school (SMC) LAN consists of an assortment of Wyse
	terminals and CompacQ Pentium 386s.

	Any advise and/or software you could give on upgrades for 
	text applications to this system would be most appreciated;
        SMC SysAdmin are <mathis> and <marks> AT <smc.maricopa.edu>.  

	yt, Scott A. Klabis, student SMC/SMCC / FCC:PG-GB-021435,
	<klabis@aztec.asu.edu>, <sak@scn.org>, 
	<125790@ef.smc.maricopa.edu>.

	US West (602) 252-1951 / AzCom 306-0531.

How about MachTen?  It's a commercial Unix clone for the Mac, but
there is a Pine port available for it...

I hope I'm sending this email to the right place as I would not want to
send any junkmail.
I'm having (or rather a blind client of ours as I work for the local Blind
Institute ) a strange trouble.
She is using Bitcom (DOS platform) to connect and access PINE.Everithing
works swimmingly,except for in "Compose" all the lines of the header
behave in a peculiar way.
Let's say I want to type "blob" in the "To" headerline.When I type
"b",nothing happens.Then I type "l",four characters appear,left arrow,
left square bracket,the "at"character then the letter b.When Typing the
next letter (o),similarly four characters appear,the three special ones
then "l".that is,the letter I previosly typed.
When I manipulate the line,for example with the Ctrl-Ll (refresh line),
or with the Ctrl-K then Ctrl-U commands (cut then uncut text) everything
reverts to normal,"blob" appears in the "To" line.
Same with the other header entries.
The body of the email itself causes no problems itself,it works perfectly
normally.
I repeat :THE HEADER AND THE BODY WORK DIFFERENTLY.
Now,I've tried every reasonable configuration modifications in both PINE
and Bitcom with no avail.The fault itself(even if peculiar) is not a great
one for a sighted person,but she being blind and using screen vocalizing
program (by the way the screen program is not the cause) the garbled text
really confuses her.
If anyone has a suggestion,please drop me an email.
Cheers from Melbourne,  Kal

I recently upgraded to pine 3.95. Shortly after I realized that pine
was complaining about creating lock files. I read some web listings of
questions about this problem and found that the only suggestion was to
change the permissions on the /var/spool/mail directory. That is all
good, but, I dont like the idea of users being able to write files to
that directory. I was wondering if sometime in the furure pine might
include an option to specify a seperate lock directory.

That wouldn't be very useful.

The whole purpose of the /var/spool/mail lock file is to lock against mail
delivery.  The mail delivery program looks for a /var/spool/mail lock
file.

If Pine used a different lock directory, then it wouldn't lock against
mail delivery.  Then wouldn't be any point for the locking code at all.
You might as well just delete the useless locking code, and accept that
every so often, your mail file will be smashed because Pine and mail
delivery wrote the mail file at the same time.

If you've hacked your mail delivery program source code to lock someplace
else, then you can hack Pine source code to do the same thing.  It should
not be any easier (e.g. an option for a lock directory in Pine), otherwise
people will be misled (as you were misled) to set that option without
recognition of the consequences.  You're really being protected from
making a bad decision.

It's a complicated issue; I wrote a document which goes into it in much
more detail.  I'll forward you a copy if you're interested.

What type?  

In Taipei you dial 119 for emergency assistance or 104 for directory

Subject: Thanks, but no thanks, for the "improved" Pine 3.96

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-To: pine@cac.washington.edu, pine-info@cac.washington.edu

Dear People-at-Pine (assuming this gets through to you),
	I am getting more and more confused, and indeed upset, with the
new "improved" system of Pine 3.96 which my university has installed to
replace Pine 3.91. I wonder if my problems are unique.  Here are just some
of the reasons for my new confusions and irritations:
	1. It would seem that someone has decided that it would be a vast
improvement, in my previous "sent mail" folders, to erase all the names of
the persons to whom I sent e-mail and replace each and every one of them
with my own name.  I don't suppose there is anyway to retrieve all that
information.  Absent that, assuming there is some way to erase own name
and restore the names of the persons to who all that mail was sent, how
would I do that?  (Probable answer: don't ask, it can't be done.)  Even if
it could be done, it is a pain to think I have to go through each of them
individually, find out to whom it was sent, and then somehow change it on
the screen. But probably I should not worry.  I'll wake up tomorrow and
find out that in the meantime someone has simply erased all the sent mail
folders (see 2. below).  End of problem!
	2.  But wait, it gets worse.  It now seems that mail I have sent
out after January 1st (i.e., after the new system of Pine was up and
running, I guess) is no longer even recorded in my sent mail folder, not
even under my own name, let alone the names of recipients.  Guess I didn't
know I had it so good in 1. above, huh?  I trust the messages are getting
through, but it's anybody's guess.  (Hence my question in the opening
above whether you will even receive this one.)  So where (if anywhere) is
there a record of my sent mail NOW?  (Probable answer: don't ask, it
doesn't exist.)
	3. Probably related to 2., I note that here is a new line now
after "cc" on messages sent out, namely, "fcc".  Now when I send out a
letter an abbreviated name pops up automatically on "fcc".  Not knowing or
having been told what it is, I eliminate it each time.  Why?  Once I tried
sending something without doing that, and when it found there was "no such
file (with that person's name)", it simply refused to send the message.
So I went back to eliminating the entry after "fcc", so at least the
message could go out (though, since there is now no record, who knows if
it REALLY went out).
	So what on earth is this "fcc" all about?  Does it mean (related
back to 2. above), that if I want to have a record of mail sent, I now
have to create individual folders for each addressee to store my sent mail
in, otherwise there will be no record of having sent it out?  And if so,
to check my sent mail, I have to go through each and every individual
person's folder?
	I hope this is not so, because otherwise this vaunted improvement,
Pine 3.96, has become an nightmare.
	Conclusion:
	Assuming not a whole lot can be done about this "improved system",
perhaps I should switch, as my friends have been encouraging me to do, to
EUDORA, since it would appear that my refusal to switch earlier from Pine
to Eudora was based on misplaced loyalty to Pine.  I guess Eudora must be
the way to go from now on.  That way I can simply circumvent this new
"improved" version of Pine altogether.
	Idea:
	Perhaps, if my colleagues using Pine are suffering similar
indignities, I should recommend that they switch to Eudora too.  Perhaps
we can persuade the university to just forget about Pine. Yep, that's what
we should do.
	So, thanks for hearing me out.  You've been a big help, really!
	Yours for even further "improvements" to Pine!  Tom Dean
P.S.  I shall try to send a copy of this, as the "robot" advised, to the
web discussion group at "comp.mail.pine".  Perhaps THAT will get through,
and perhaps THEY will be interested to know.

Hey Ed? Robin?
I found something odd that might attract your interest;
Running Pine under AIX4.0, for no (known) reason, each time I invoke Pine,
it spawns four pinerc's (not dot pinerc's) and with a letter following,
then a five digit number.
I stopped the problem (though I wish I really knew how) but wodered if you
had ever seen/heard of Pine doing this.
Like I said, it's gone away and I didn't follow any methodical
troubleshooting method, just "thrashed around" in the users' home
directory until Pine worked, and the spawning of pinerc's quit.
Not the most scientific solution I know...any suggestions?

Dear Pine-info:
How does one get a message to the "comp.mail.pine" group?  Via an e-mail
address, or via a web address?  I tried "http://www.comp.mail.pine" and
that did not work.  I tried "http://comp.mail.pine" and that did not work.
Any suggestions or help greatly appreciated!

Oh yes, it's Pine 3.96 (like that makes any difference)...
Oh and to all that say 3.96 has anything "wrong" with it...it doesn't! :)
But...that's just my .02 cents' worth!

Of course not. "http" is the URL for "hypertext transport protocol", a method
for viewing Web pages in your browser. comp.mail.pine is a newsgroup in Usenet,
and Usenet has its own URL.

>Any suggestions or help greatly appreciated!

I take it you have the ability to post news articles through your Web browser. 
You clearly don't have a question about pine. My suggestion is, Don't ask an
inappropriate question on the comp.mail.pine newsgroup!

btw, this is the pine-info mailing list. People here are willing to answer
questions about pine, hence the name of the list. If you ask a question that is
asked repeatedly, the answer will be, "Read the context-sensitive help."

All the information is still there. What probably happened was your system
administrator got sick of all the complaints of the nature, "How come when I
send mail (or news), the recipient's (or newsgroup's) name appears in the
index, instead of my name?" and changed the setting in the system-wide
configuration file. So, override it in your own configuration file!

As an experienced pine user, you are familiar with the configuration file,
right? You are familiar with reading the context-sensitive help, right? 3.96
has many additional features. Look at the configuration file, and if there is a
feature you don't understand or don't recognize, read the context-sensitive
help. It's that simple.

The feature that was changed is "index-format", and the FROMORTO token was
replaced with FROM. Read the context-sensitive help with this feature, and
choose the tokens that best suit your needs.

You did this yourself, as you explain in 3.

"fcc" means "file carbon copy", which has been a feature of pine since the
beginning. You may not have noticed it before, as it may have been a rich
header, not revealed until you press ^r. If you want to know about it, READ THE
CONTEXT-SENSITIVE HELP.

It is simply a way of saving a copy of an outgoing message on your own system.
Even if you are able to save a sent message, it hasn't necessarily left your
system due to other problems. You don't know unless your recipient tells you
he actually received it.

If you continuously delete the "fcc" line, your message won't be saved
anywhere. In the context-sensitive help, read about "customized-hdrs" and
"fcc-name-rule" from the configuration file. Also, read the context-sensitive
help in the address book for naming customized sent-mail folders for specific
correspondents. And, read about "folder-collections" from the configuration
file and the List folders screen.

Well, if you refuse to read the help text or learn the program, you won't have
any greater satisfaction with Eudora.

If I may interject a small suggestion here,
Since Pine is also a mail reader, perhaps the esteemed list member could
access "L" (Folder List) then travel down to "New Collection" and follow
menu prompts from there onwards.
entering comp.mail when prompted for groups to search for will immediately
access comp.mail.pine, along with other interesting newsgroups that relate
to mail programs out there.
Just a suggestion, which would get the reader to the resource he wants,
while *still using* the resources of this list.
Regards to all, and best wishes for a "Great '98"!

>> "TJD" == Thomas J Dean <tjdean@astro.ocis.temple.edu> whined:

[Thomas J. Dean has new confusions and irritations]
TJD> 1. It would seem that someone has decided that it would be a vast
TJD> improvement, in my previous "sent mail" folders, to erase all the
TJD> names of the persons to whom I sent e-mail and replace each and
TJD> every one of them with my own name.

That's a FAQ, Thomas.

TJD> 2.  It now seems that mail I have sent out after January 1st
TJD> (i.e., after the new system of Pine was up and running, I guess)
TJD> is no longer even recorded in my sent mail folder, not even
TJD> under my own name, let alone the names of recipients.

That's a FAQ, Thomas.

TJD> 3. Probably related to 2., I note that here is a new line now
TJD> after "cc" on messages sent out, namely, "fcc".    So what on
TJD> earth is this "fcc" all about? 

That's a FAQ, Thomas.

TJD> Conclusion: Assuming not a whole lot can be done about this
TJD> "improved system", perhaps I should switch, as my friends have
TJD> been encouraging me to do, to EUDORA, since it would appear that
TJD> my refusal to switch earlier from Pine to Eudora was based on
TJD> misplaced loyalty to Pine.  I guess Eudora must be the way to go
TJD> from now on.

Absolutely correct, Thomas. Eudora is much simpler to use, the knowledge
base of the people supporting it on the net is much higher, and commercial
software is always better than free software.

TJD> Idea: Perhaps, if my colleagues using Pine are suffering similar
TJD> indignities, I should recommend that they switch to Eudora too.

Yes, please do that, Thomas.

TJD> Perhaps we can persuade the university to just forget about
TJD> Pine. Yep, that's what we should do.

Correct, Thomas. "Heute die Uni und morgen die ganze Welt." 

TJD> You've been a big help, really!  Yours for even further
TJD> "improvements" to Pine!

Thomas? Are you there? Have you talked to some professional about your
problems yet? You know, it's not that we don't like you... It's just
that you have this attitude problem that makes reading your larmoyant
drivel really, really revolting.

TJD> I shall try to send a copy of this, as the "robot" advised, to
TJD> the web discussion group at "comp.mail.pine".  Perhaps THAT will
TJD> get through, and perhaps THEY will be interested to know.

Great idea, Thomas. Please do that. I will gladly provide you with some
more in-depth information about your attitude problem there. However,
since this is a mailing list that is read by kind and helpful people,
I'll spare you for now. See you on the usenet, Thomas. Don't forget to
wear an asbestos suit.

Robin,
        Many thanks for matching my sarcastic attitude!  At least it was a
response from a real person, not the "robot"  However, you might also be
interested in the following reply from Steve Lowe which managed to
overlook or see past my attitude problem and offer some real help (though
I will have to get help to figure out how to look at something called the
".pinerc file").
        Meantime, as to your response, I did look at the FAQ and did find
an answer to one of my questions.  But I was not successful in finding
answers to the others, or if they were there, I was unable to recognize
them (you're probably not surprised by that).
        So, what you could do to also be of real help, if you're so
inclined, in addition to simply "agreeing" with each of my ill-tempered 
remarks, would be to tell me WHICH of the FAQ's (which I note were
numbered) answer each of my problems.  If you're not so inclined, I can't
say as I blame you.
        Hoping (beyond hope?), Tom

Thomas --
As a data center manager, we have made the transition several times over
the past three years to different versions of Pine.  We have not noticed
the problems that you outlined in your message.

I can only one of them--the 'fcc' line.  'fcc' indicates the default mail
folder where your sent mail is stored -- might be related to the    
disappearing copies of your sent mail.  Pine 3.96 allows the user to store
his outgoing mail messages in any folder that he/she desires.  If the
folder does not exist, Pine 3.96 will prompt you for folder creation.

I would check your .pinerc file and ensure that extra characters have not
been added to the default sent mail folder entry.  This might clear up your
problem.

HTH.

It is *very* bad form to comment on anyone's spelling errors.  This is 
especially true when the message is from a person's whose native language

Talk to a lawyer.

BTW, please tell us how you came upon the pine-info mailing list and what
prompted you to ask your question here.  We keep getting these questions
about changing names....and pine is an email program.  Go figure.

spelling flame [USENET] n. 
   A posting ostentatiously correcting a previous article's spelling
   as a way of casting scorn on the point the article was trying to
   make, instead of actually responding to that point (compare
   dictionary flame).  Of course, people who are more than usually

   flames themselves often contain spelling errors.

You know pico, the editor you write your emails with. Yes, it's a

	    cp ~/.pinerc ~/pinerc.sic

I don't know. It should be one. Whatever... You need to set 
default-saved-msg-folder = <No Value Set: using "saved-messages">
in M(ain) S(etup) C(onfig). From the online help:

         OPTION: Default-Saved-Msg-Folder
This option determines the default folder name for Saves...  If
this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for
saves.  Any valid folder specification, local or IMAP, is allowed.
This default folder only applies when the saved-msg-name-rule (see
later in this configuration screen) doesn't override it.  Unix
Pine default is normally "saved-messages" in the default folder
collection. PC-Pine default is "SAVEMAIL" (normally stored as
SAVEMAIL.MTX)
FOR MORE INFORMATION: From the Main Menu, select "L FOLDER LIST" and
press "?" for Help... Look for the section "Valid Folder Names".

Make sure that one is properly set and that your admin didn't set them 
to something weird.

I think this is similar to the laws of physics, which are extremely hard to

Dear vi1@krcl.ernet.in....

Everytime I send an email to you I get back a "blank" message.  If you
want folks to correspond with you you should try getting that fixed.

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large

Robin,
	Many thanks for bearing with me and helping out with the below.  I
am beginning to suspect that, as you say, the problem may lie with how the
local admin installed things when they did the conversion from 3.91 to
3.96 over the holidays.  And since I don't understand all the technical
aspects you refer to below, I think my best course of action is to take
all these problems back to the local folks and see what they make of it
all.  They should be back from New Year's break tomorrow.  Fingers
crossed! (Final word at end of following...)

Dear Pine Person,

I've been using Pine for some time now.
Recently my messages have become "Read Only", and are not deletable.
Is this something you can help me with, or do I need to contact my
system's administrator?

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,

Esther P. Leeflang

Hi All!
Y'Know, we never did address Pine's odd behavior in suddenly spawning
multiple pinerc's.
As I mentioned before, any suggestions as to how thos peculiar behavior
began would be welcome.

Hi,
	I have installed the tcp/ip stack on a win 3.11. The problem is 
that I want to compart the HD of a Linux (server of the ethernet).

What kind of Lan's support do I have to put in the configuration of the 
tcp/ip (on win 3.11) to recognize my ethernet?

Do I have to use SAMBA? Do I need a SAMBA client for win 3.11? Where can 
I find it?

Can You help me?

Thanks

Depends on whose TCP/IP implementation you are using.  Contact the vendor.

Depends on what you want do to...

Probably not....you've stumbled onto the wrong group for your questions.

Say this:

    ps -ax | grep pine

If more than one instance of pine is running, kill it by saying

   kill <pid>

where pid is the number ps gives you. You can only run one session at
a time, otherwise will will create read-only sessions.

If there is a form available for use by a self-representing citizen to   
change his/her name on their own, could you please point me in the right   
direction.  Lawyers quote very expensive rates for something that seems   
as if it should be "fill-in-the-blanks" easy.

I now have to begin seriously wondering where all this name change stuff
stems from.
Is there a Search Engine weird link thing that causes a simple query
"Name+Change" to somehow return a value of Pine Discussion Group??
When this happened the first (six? eight?) times I thought it might have
been word of mouth...but now???
Anyone got any ideas how this crap winds up here? Better still, how do we
change this?

I sent Randi a message asking her, and she sent back a nasty reply, saying I
wasn't "friendly". Perhaps Robin could be friendlier than I.

She said she used yahoo, but didn't tell me what her search criterion was.

This list is archived, and the archives aren't hidden from search engines. My
guess is that the more inappropriate questions we get on this topic, the higher
this mailing list will score, in a geometric progression.

Please tell us why you send to this list?  We are trying to track down
how people come to the conclusion that your type of question should be
directed here.

Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

Those are the temp files that Pine writes when updating your .pinerc
file.  If an error occurs during the write (e.g. out of disk space) 
the temp file is abandoned, otherwise it is renamed to .pinerc...

Ouch! that's richly bizarre isn't it?
I'll have to do a search and see what happens.
I can hardly wait for Robin's take on this subject Adam, it should be

Just for kicks I tried it my self and found that the following search will
hit the pine-info archive right off the bat even though the first document
found is about a user wanting to "legally" change his name in pine.  It
might help if the disclaimer at the top included a little extra
information (ie. What is "Pine-info").  Anyhow.  If anyone wants to
reproduce the search:

Hello people
 I am using pine 3.96. and i don't want this pine to be able writing to
/var/spool/mail/.. dir (OS. Linux. R.H. 4.1). However, when pine reads M.B
it attempts to lock mailbox by creating similar lock file in the same dir.
 i tried to set quell-waring-lock-... but it doesn't help. Any ideas how
to force pine to complain about locking or get it using another path for
lock?

Dear sir/madam,

You can enter the Config session of Setup to find your address book's
filename and then check the write permissions of that file.

Subject: INBOX specification problem in PC-Pine
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I am trying to run pine OFFLINE on a PC (c:\pine and c:\pine\mail). I use
Trumpet Winsock under Win311. I hope to use Pine in this fashion only to
access archive folders I have in the mail dir. I don't want/need to do a
dialup to an ISP. 

Problem: the delay of 20 seconds or so while pine tries to find an INBOX
is frustrating.  The search finally times out and allows me to hit ENTER
to choose a default path and then the folder screen will show an inbox
with no files in it - all is ok after that - can access the other folders
just fine. Would like to have it find INBOX and open it quicker than 20
seconds. 

In the PINERC file I have set user-id=gatesj, personal-name=John Gates,
and inbox-path=c:\pine\$user. 

I have copied a valid folder/file from the pine\mail dir into the \pine
dir and renamed it "gatesj".

Haven't made any progress - any ideas? 

Thanks all! 
John Gates

Dear Randi,

there are quite a few ways to get one's name changed. There is a hard
one, which would turn you into St. Bagley. It would involve stuff
that majorly sucks like cutting coats in two and stuff. Not cool.

Secondly, there is a way that would turn you into Mrs. Randi Cummins,
which would require marrying one of the lamest morons the world has
ever seen. If you're into this kind of guy, you should consider it an
option.

Right now, the most attractive solution for you in my mind would be to
keep posting to this list. It would certainly lead to a couple of
people helping you to change your name to "the late Ms Bagley". This
would not require any additional input on your behalf, but instead the
kind and generous application of fire-arms, baseball bats, chainsaws
and heavy artillery on ours.

If you don't like any of these choices:

[x] get a life
[x] get lost
[x] get professional help
[x] drop dead

	My email was updated automatically in the last 24 hours. My
folders were supposedly put into a new directory, but i can not find any
of them. Furthermore, i lost all my adresses saved in my address. One more
thing, am I suppose to receive and send files, if so how do I retrieve
them?
	Thanks so much for your time!

Robin,

Sorry, I zapped your entire message.  However, you always complain that
irrelevant stuff shouldn't be quoted.  :-)

I have an email contact with several individuals who have posted to
pine-info asking about "C hanging N ames".  It seems all of the ones
I've communicated with have performed searches at yahoo or other places
with phrases shown to produce results point to pine-info a previously
holding conversations about that subject.  

The folks performing the search just assume that their seach request will
return "valid" pointers and proceed to contact one of the indicated
sources.

The people doing the search tend to be "regular" people with little or 
no knowledge of the technology they are using, let alone its limitations.
They've never heard of "pine" and wouldn't have a reason to stop and
think about how "pine" can or cannot be connected with their request.

Like it or not, these people make up a growing percentage of the Internet
comunity.  So, you will be seeing more and more of this type of "error".

Yelling at them and making rude comments is not going to improve the
situation.  The only purpose it serves is to foster the image of the 
Internet as and unfriendly place.  

The situation is bound to get worse before it gets better.  But, by their
numbers, these folks make the Internet a cheaper place for all.  So, we
(and that *surely* includes me) should learn a bit of tolerance and try to
help rather than attack.

Regards,
Ed

Running Solaris 2.5 on a Sun Ultra Sparc with Wyse 50's, 150's and 150es'..

Problem #1
TERM=wyse50 for an environment variable. 
The Wyse 150 and 150es terminals run Pine beautifully as long as the
terminal is set up to emulate a Wyse 150 or 150+. If I set them up to
emulate a Wyse 50 or 50+, the screen displays are misaligned.

The Wyse 50 terminals that we have only have one Wyse emulation available 
(WY50). So with these terminals the screen displays are misaligned.

I have tried messing with the environment variable in unix, but can find
nothing that will work. I also attempted going with vt100 for everything,
but our ancient database program will not fully support vt100 mode. Does
anyone know of a pine config setting that I can change, or have any other
solution to this problem?

Problem #2
We do not currently have an Internet connection, so our nodename (uname)
does not have an internet extension (i.e. .COM, .EDU, .GOV). Because of this
, we get warnings from pine that our mail domain is incomplete. Does anyone
know of a way to shut these warnings off without changing out nodename?

Please e-mail replies to

Thanks for your time.

There's too much that's unknown to constructively help you. First
thing...verry first thing, contact your local systems administrator and ask
that person precisely what you posted here.
We could send you off on an "ls -laF" this and "grep" that and chances are
you'd wind up really frustrated, and neither learn what the problem was, or
learn much about Pine in the process either.
All of the questions you posed can be succinctly answered by your local
sysadmin...too many variables for anyone to have the slightest hope of
constructively helping you.
Try that first, then if you have further Pine questions, well then come on
back and we'll help you.

Dear Sir or Miss,

	I received a attachment along with one of the letters that I
received and I can't figure out how to get it.  The attachment is my
Uncle, Aunt and cousin singing we wish you a merry christmas.  The system
said to save it so I did and now I can't find it.  Please tell me how to
get to it if you can. 


					Thanks,
						Jenn

Perhaps you should save it again from the message.

It does tell you the filename when you hit S.

You can pick another filename if you want.

I am not sure what you mean there "The system said to save it".  Pine allows
you to save attachments, but I'm not sure about *instructing* you to save it.

Once saved, you can download the file.  And do with it as you wish.

Do you have or know of any drivers that will help us open an attachment
sent to us in MIME format in Word 6 or Notepad.  At the moment when we try
to open them they change to .BIN format and when opened in Word or Notepad
they appear in hieroglyphics.

Please help or let me know if there is anyone else who can help?????

When Pine isn't sure of the format of the attachment, it does
tell you to use View/Attach to save it to a file...

Jenn, you need to find out from your local computing support
people what you have available to you as a file transfer program,
and how to use it.  Use View/Attach in the e-mail message to save
the attachment to a file in your account's home directory (Pine
will automatically save to the home directory by default).  Then
use your system's FTP client to download the file to the hard
drive of your computer.  

Later...
Lea

I think they are submitting questions to this list through their browser using
the mailto: URL in the archives. Unless Robin were to write to them directly,
her pithy observations are for our entertainment only.

The pine-info list is open to postings from non-subscribers.

There is a solution to this problem: Moderate questions posted by non-
subscribers. Move long-time contributors to a hidden, unmoderated list. The
first time a subscriber asks a question having to do with pine, move him to the
unmoderated list.

Irrelevant questions get relevant "best of Robin" responses.

I'm not subscribed to this list, but am reading an archived post.  I have
had a similar problem to that of Felix Karpfen when trying to mark text so
I can delete several lines at once.  I run Pine by proxy by telnetting to
the WORLD.STD.COM system and using the login and password (by permission)
of a user of that system.  I configured the version of Pine he is using to
allow the marking of text, and it did work at first, and has worked
occasionally since, but mostly, it just causes characters to be typed to
the composed post and I usually have to quit Pine and re-enter it to fix
this, or I cannot even use the regular commands.  Anyone have any ideas
about why this should happen?

Subject: problem with display filter
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've a problem with display filters in pine 3.96. I'm trying to use this
option with a perl script, but if the script returns any "\n" character the
only thing I get is a "Success Hit return to continue" from pine, and when I
hit return, the viewer shows only a
 
[Error: Formatting Error: Success]

I've tried several scripts,always with the same result. If the output
contains no "\n", pine shows no errors but also no text.
Can someone give me a hint to track down the problem?
I'm using pine under linux 2.1.75 and perl 5.
Thanks in advance.

"To save disk space, delete old SENT mail folder sent-mail-dec-1997?"


I've looked through .pinerc a couple of times and tried some searches
through the archives of this mailing list but haven't been able to find
how to turn this option off. Is there a switch somewhere?

Any help would be appreciated,

this problem is (still) not a pine issue. The message tells you that
you should tidy up your place because the part of disk space which has
been given to you is all used up. There exist some possible solutions,
to be used in the mentioned order

(a) remove old, now unwanted since no more needed files (some old
    mails, eg) 
(b) bribe your sys admin / help desk clerk to rise your disk quota
(c) ...

I know, I've been missing some ways to solve the problem (shoot other
users and get their disk quota for example) ... but this I consider
unprofessional.

After you've cleaned some files your configuration file can be saved
again (perhaps you should take a glance at it, it might be broken) and
sent-mail should work again.

l8er, norbert.

In your .pinerc file find the entry:

# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning. 
last-time-prune-questioned=98.1

Set it to 110.1 and the next time it will ask you is 2010.

Along with the good advice of Norbert, you should also be made aware that
these types of problems should be first worked thru you ISP's helpdesk.

VSNL has a helpdesk in Deli, yes?

You seem to be saying that being rude to someone is OK as long as they
can't hear you.  Or, maybe being rude to strangers is somehow humorous?

Some people are ignorant of the fact their questions are irrelevant.  That
means you have a license to snap at them?

Sorry for this off topic comment....now back to "pine" issues.

No, Ed. Rudeness requires that the target be aware of what was said.

Unless Robin sent them private e-mail, she's can't be rude to someone who
isn't on the list. Whether or not YOU found it funny is another matter.

It's up to the list owner. But, I'd be willing to help.

You volunteering to write the responses?

Actually, we get a significant amount of off-topic posting, and we should
attempt to solve the problem. I suggest that we continue this thread.

Why don't we send mail to yahoo explaining the situation and asking if
they could possibly remove that particular listing for us? Does anyone
know anyone over there?

A solution a little less drastic than full moderation would simply be to
not allow posts from people who haven't subscribed--it's a common enough
mailing list convention. Yes, it means that to ask a question, one must
figure out how to subscribe, but it's not that hard, and it would probably
filter out most of the accidental off topics.

It should be fixed in the pine archives themselves. yahoo, and the other search
engines, wouldn't customize anything unless the university paid a fee.

Dear All,
I notice that a couple of people have reported on this list that they
are unable to get Pine 3.96 to see all folders on an exchange server
running 5.5 with IMAP enabled. I too have encountered this and was told
that this is due to the absence of some optional IMAP2 backwards
compatibility in the MS product. Can anyone confirm this and if so
anyone put a timescale on the release of a full IMAP4 version of Pine ?
I'm certainly keen to see it. 
Cheers, Ian

Sure. We all know that, Ed. The problem is: would you like me to run

Noone's done that IIRC. We've all been very helpful and understanding. Face

Oh yeah? If somehow Microsoft decided to give away guns for free, so
that everyone could have even more information at their fingertips,
would you just sit there and say "thanks guys, great job"? The internet
is not an unfriendly place at all if you stick to the rules that guys
much cleverer than you and I made up years ago. If for whatever reason
*they* should decide that pouring their crap into *our* information

It's certainly not going to get any better if the people who know what 
the internet can do just sit there silently waiting for the next
glorious toilet appliance from Redmond.

ESG> But, by their numbers, these folks make the Internet a cheaper
ESG> place for all.

May I politely interject here: this is about the dumbest thing I've
heard for years? The internet is not cheap, and if it is to work at
all, it will have to be made a *lot* more expensive. Just look at what
AOL, compusmurf and MSN have done to the net already. Hell, I got
about the fastest machine I ever had - but my download ratios plainly
suck. IRC is being taken over by child pornographers and KeWL WaREz
GuYZ. Even a.s.s. is full of commercial crap. And you want to tell
*me* that the net is getting cheaper?  I mean, yeah, it's being
cheapened and nastied, but it's not getting any cheaper... This
sucks. I hate those lusers.

Appeasement? No, Sir, thank you, we've had that before, and it didn't
work then, either. I say, let's stand and fight. Ummm... and help,
where we can, too. }:->

Subject: how to use pine with different email-accounts?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi.

i have several folders in my pine which are filled by my procmail
with e-mail from differnet servers.
now i want to write an email from the folder "xy" with my email-address
binder@xy;
when i am in folder "xz", i want to write an email with the adresse
binder@xz.

I had a possible solution with different .pinerc, but this does not solve
it proper for my needs, i just want to go from one folder and reply with
one of the email-adresses...

I don't know much about filtering with pine, but could this be done with
an outgoing filter, which does some sendmail? (don't know much about
sendmail either!). 

thanx for your help...

Thomas.

Hi!

In the FOLDER INDEX pine displays the SENDER of a message. "If you are 
the sender, the first recipient's name is shown here."

Can you tell pine somehow that you have more than one email-address?

My email-address has changed a few times (partly becouse
I traveld to other countries), and so I often see my name instead
of the recipient's when I brouwse through old mailfolders.
(The alternative of changing the From: Name lines "manually" in old
mailfolders doesn't seem too attractive to me.)

If there is no such feature, maybe this could be a suggestion for further
versions?

Please answer directly, since I am not a subscriber of the mailing-list.

thanks

>Can you tell pine somehow that you have more than one email-address?

In the configuration file, add your old addresses to the option
"alt-addresses". For more information, read the context-sensitive help.

You may have as many as you like. In your folders, you will see the
recipient's name or newsgroup listed if you are the author, and you will also
see the "+" if you are the recipient for any of the addresses you list.

Port 143 is the imap tcp port. This tells me that IMAP is NOT turned
running on the NT exchange server. Need to make sure you have IMAP
running on that box!.

A simple test will let you know when it is running. from a command
prompt run:

$ telnet  imap01  143 - imap01 is the hostname of exchange server.

this is what you should get back
Trying...
Connected to imap01.
Escape character is '^T'.
OK Microsoft Exchange IMAP4rev1 server version 5.5.1960.6 (imap01) ready

If you do not get the message from exchange then it is not running.

Thanks Marty

Sigh. Who has a theory on how a Web page from the archives was the highest

Adam;
    I recently wrote to Ed on this subject. Having read the thread that
seems to have developed, I concur with the apparent concensus that a
moderated list and an unmoderated private one alongside seems to have the
structure necessary to solve the problem.
    I would be willing to moderate a new subscriber's list, and since I
prefer to avoid flaming or retorting to silly-assed queries, maybe that
might be of some help when acting as a moderator. For that matter, perhaps
those core members could rotate moderation on (say) a three month basis. If
we had four willing members, then each would run the list once per year. If
not, then what the hell, I'll moderate it.
    What would be necessary from U/Wash point of view to make this happen,
and would they necessarily agree with the need to do this? Does this become
a policy issue? I have no clue what the possible answers are to any of the
above. Maybe it doesn't matter...I don't know.
    I accede to the wishes of the majority here, but I have the patience to
do it which may help.

I don't know who the Webmaster is, and who the list-owner is. The Webmaster
would need to change the archives to clearly give a description of pine on any
Web page that has a mailto: URL. I got a letter today on "lxgal nxme chxnge".

Fixing the Web pages would likely eliminate 90% of the irrelevant posts from
nonsubscribers.

Any post from a nonsubscriber would be sent to the moderation pool. Any new
subscriber could be moderated till he asks a relevant question. The list server
used is ListProc, and I assume it could filter mail along these lines.

This is my suggestion. I wish the list-owner would post a message offering the
University's opinion.

For the past four days, I have not been receiving all my e-mail.  Only
part of the messages are getting through.  I've sent myself test messages
as well as messages to a group.  These are not getting through.  Messages
to certain individuals are being delivered.  Any suggestions?

Hi,

your message-id is something like 'Pine.SOL.3.95...'. Therefore, I
guess that you are on a unix machine.

If this holds true, you must ask your local sys admin whether she's
got any backup tapes of your folder collection directory ($HOME/mail
or whatever you've put into your .pinerc), because delete in the unix
world doesn't provide any means to retrieve old files by guessing
strange leading characters.

On Windows systems it should be possible to get them back using
undelete, but I'm absolutely the wrong person to answer this :-)

Hmm ... Ed, is this statement correct? To all the others ... is this
statement *not* offending?

l8er, norbert.

Hi,

you are absolutely right ... this is not a primary pine problem :-)

The problem with moderation is: who's got the spare time and is
willing/able to read/stand all the crap that is coming along the
strange and twisted channels knocking at the pine mailing-list's
door. It is certainly not possible for me, my chef is going to kill me
on the spot :-/

just my 2p, norbert.

Just a thought...

Rather than going the whole hog and turning the list into a moderated one
(ie, have every article vetted by a human before passing on to the list at
large) how about converting it to become a _closed_ list, so that only
subscribers can post to it?  Then people who haven't subscribed but try to
post would get an error message back telling them that the list is a
closed one, and presumably this could go on to explain (a) what the list
is REALLY for, and (b) how to subscribe.

This would avoid the burden on, and delays in postings caused by having to
filter articles through, a humanoid whilst hopefully significantly cut
down the junk from spammers, web-searchers, and other random odds-n-sods. 

Any comments anyone?

hmmm, maybe that the inbox is read only and you can't work with the
mails in it apart from reading them?

But well, let's see ... either you started pine with a '-o' switch
(that's read only for the first folder) or another pine process is
allocating your inbox. In the second case, which is announced by pine
at start up time, kill the other process (you know ... ps -ef | grep
pine ; kill -9 <pid>).

Of course :-)

The suggestion sounds quite good to me ... the only problem might be,
imo, that point (b) only delays the emergence of off-topic mails, but
it's worth a try. Point (a) is *very* interesting, since this
mailing-list has been set up in order to separate more technically
based questions on pine from FAQs that are to be posted to
comp.mail.whine (oops :-). In fact, FAQs shouldn't be posted at all,
but that's a different cup of tea.

Ed, Robin what do you think?

Subject: Garbage in mail bodies using IMAP and Exchange 5.5
Content-Type: text
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm using Pine 3.96 on FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE talking to a Microsoft
Exchange 5.5 machine.

My problem is that when I attach to my Exchange inbox using IMAP,
the mail bodies are displayed as garbage characters that contain
random characters.  Sometimes part of the message is displayed
and the end is truncaged and/or garbage, and sometimes just garbage
is displayed.  The headers always look fine.

This is not just a display problem, because if I forward the mail
to another machine (not running Pine), it sees this garbage also.
This leads me to believe that the problem is in the mail itself,
and is not just a display issue.

I've put a sniffer on the line to see what is being transferred
back and forth from Exchange.  Everything looks okay.  The entire
message is transmitted from Exchange with no garbage and no
truncation.  Still the mail doesn't show correctly in Pine.

I do not have similar problem when looking at a local mailbox.

Has anyone heard of this problem?  Any hints as to what to try?
I've looked through the archives but I could not find any
information.

Thanks in advance.

Eric.

Well.. unless she's running WinBlows 95 (no undelete unless you can find
one on the net somewhere.. if you do, lemme know ;)
95 has the recycle bin, but that is Windows specific.  If you delete a
file any other way than "moving it to the recycle bin".. it's GONE

I have seen this problem here also. What I found is the it is a problem
word mail on exchange client side. If I create a message from exchange
client using the default editor ( NOT WORD or what is called WORD MAIL )
then the message and send it then check the message with pine looks
fine. If I use WORD MAIL on the exchange client then send it and check
it with pine I have trash at the end of the message. I think this is
because WORD MAIL is not ending the document correctly. But I am still
working on it. Can you run a test like this a see if you find the same
thing.

Also can anyone tell me what to look for in the format of the mail
message to find out what WORD MAIL might be doing wrong in the email
message format. If I can find that then I think I can get Microsloth to
look at it. 

Thanks Marty

	Subject:  Garbage in mail bodies using IMAP and Exchange 5.5

	I'm using Pine 3.96 on FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE talking to a
Microsoft
	Exchange 5.5 machine.

	My problem is that when I attach to my Exchange inbox using
IMAP,
	the mail bodies are displayed as garbage characters that contain
	random characters.  Sometimes part of the message is displayed
	and the end is truncaged and/or garbage, and sometimes just
garbage
	is displayed.  The headers always look fine.

	This is not just a display problem, because if I forward the
mail
	to another machine (not running Pine), it sees this garbage
also.
	This leads me to believe that the problem is in the mail itself,
	and is not just a display issue.

	I've put a sniffer on the line to see what is being transferred
	back and forth from Exchange.  Everything looks okay.  The
entire
	message is transmitted from Exchange with no garbage and no
	truncation.  Still the mail doesn't show correctly in Pine.

	I do not have similar problem when looking at a local mailbox.

	Has anyone heard of this problem?  Any hints as to what to try?
	I've looked through the archives but I could not find any
	information.

	Thanks in advance.

	Eric.

Do it very quietly.

Re closing the list to subscribers only:  I'm probably wrong and
too tired to think straight anyhow, but just a sec - I thought
that one of the main reasons we have such a problem with
off-topic posts on the mailing list is that the pine newsgroup
gateways posts to list.  Is that right?  I probably explained it
wrong, but basically I thought there was some sort of transfer
between the two entities.  If we stopped the
newsgroup-to-mailing-list flow, wouldn't that fix the problem?

I get the problem even when I create the mail by telnetting into the
smtp port on the mail server and typing in a straight ASCII message.

My particular problem doesn't depend on the type of client being used.

First, however, the explanation must be given on every Web page in the archives
that has a mailto: URL. This is where the irrelevant questions originate from.

Does anyone want to admit to being the listowner or the Webmaster?

The gateway was eliminated several months ago.

It was indeed bi-directionally gatewayed to comp.mail.pine for quite a
long time.  However the gatewaying broke and nobody noticed for 2-3
months.

They then sought opinion on the List whether the gateway should be
re-established and the result was, if memory serves, that it shouldn't be. 

The idea was, I think, that comp.mail.pine would be more
newbie-question-ish whilst pine-info focussed more on discussing ways of
improving and devloping Pine.

Mark Crispin/David Miller/Another Pine Team Entity... care to comment?

In order to hopefully cut down somewhat on that phenomenon of people
performing searches in WWW indexes, retrieving pages from the pine-info
(converted-to-HTML) archives as a result, and then writing to the list on
non-Pine topics, I have added a blurb to the HTML files for individual
messages and listings of messages.  Also, the individual-message HTML files
now contain the element:

<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">

which should eventually reduce the presence of pine-info postings in WWW
indexes. 

All this is in effect only for the current month's (Jan. '98) messages now,
and will be for the entire archives starting early next month. With luck,
that will help a bit with reducing irrelevant posts.

Legxl nxme chxnge has now been asked so many times, it should be a FAQ.

Yup.  Another factor was that no-one stepped forward as a volunteer to
re-establish and maintain the gateway.

That was the hope, though I haven't really seen much shift in that
direction :-(

We would love to restrict pine-info postings to subscribers, but there
are just too many pointers to it floating around.  When/if Listproc
can generate a satisfactory "bounce" message for non-subscribers, we
may consider the restriction.  BTW, we're also considering a way to
allow posting to comp.mail.pine through the (re-designed) Bug Report
screen.

more like the webtraffic-to-mailing-list flow--make them either type in
the email address of the list, or else make the only place one can get to
it on a page which says in big letters "Pine is an email program. This is
a list for questions about pine. Not anything else."

OK, let's get hold of the list owner, and take this to the next step.
Otherwise we'll continue to endure the same blistering "asbestos gloves"
nonsense concerning irrelevant posts and I for one would rather help fix it,
than complain about it, and have to read Robin's "insult du jour" which
bless his heart...gets real old after a while.
I don't mind moderating a new list, I just want the problem to go away by
proactive means. I welcome any suggestions you can come up with.
I asked two people who mis-posted (after *politely* telling them where they
had posted to, and why it/we couldn't help 'em) to send me URL's of any
*actual" resource on the name change thig. If I can get hold of those URL(s)
I'll do up a recipe in procmail to send out an autoresponse that will take
care of those posts.
In the meantime, I wish I knew that anyone from the University actually read
anything from the lists!

Carolyn;
You should immediately contact your *local* systems administrator about
this.
Members of this list could not render any assistance whatsoever, it's a
problem which must be resolved within your network locally, there are a
dozen possible reasons that this could be happening, and none of us could
troubleshoot your local network.
Sorry we couldn't be of more help to you and Good Luck!

Since at least some irrelevant posts seem to come to the list via people
clicking on the <mailto:pine-info@u.washington.edu> links on the individual
messages' WWW pages in the archives, those will also no longer be generated
-- for the current month starting tomorrow, for the other months starting
early next month.

there's some nice info about it at
http://www.ii.com/internet/faqs/launchers/mail/filtering-faq/

This doesn't work if you're using IMAP..and that's a solution that I'm
working on in my (never copious) free time.

By "secret" do you mean that only the intended receipient can read it?

There are various methods for doing this.  However, both ends need to=20
support the method being used.

I use PGP for this purpose.   http://www.pgp.com

Ok,U/Wash has kindly modified their web page(s) to avoid getting
hits on "legal name change" to this list, does anyone still feel that a
separate moderated list should exist in order to prune new posings?
Is there a concensus on this?

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection

Go to the main menu screen of Pine, select "S" (setup) "C" (Configure) and
tab down to "nntp server" 
It should be set to <No Value Set> which will cause Pine to ignore the
existence of a news server.
BTW, before doing that, you might also check out Pine's newsgroup feature
set. It's nicely integrated with the mail client, and is usually a fast
and easy newsreader to use. That however, is just IMHO (In My Humble
Opinion) others may have religous fervor concerning the newsreader you
should use. At the end of the day, it's what suits *you* best that decides
the issue. You can't beat the simplicity of Pine's newsreader though.
Good Luck!

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Sender: felkarp@supreme
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

This request for help relates not to a problem experienced with the Pine
program, but with an associated program which also needs to work in order
to use all the features available by the Pine program.  I take the liberty
to send it to this newsgroup, because the local Service Provider has not
been able to help and I do not know where else to send it. 


The relevant associated program is concerned with transferring files
between my `home' directory use by the Pine program and the hard drive of
my PC.  This program has two available routines - one (sz) for moving
files from the Pine `home' directory to my PC and the second (rz) for
moving files from my PC to my Pine `home' directory.  When either routine
is invoked, the routine requests an argument and a file name but from that
point the behaviour is different.  With the `sz' routine, the name of the
file to be transferred to the PC is sufficient for the transfer to occur.
However, when the `rz' routine without an argument is invoked and an
attempt is made to use the Communication Program's `send routine' (which
works smoothly with the local Bulletin Board), the appropriate `send
screen' is displayed but no file transfer occurs.  From this, I presume
that the argument requested by the rz routine is not an optional extra.


The attached help screen lists 10 different arguments that can be used
with the `rz' routine.  However, the screen gives no information about the
circumstances in which such use would be appropriate.  I am reluctant to
take a `trial-and-error' approach in case I louse up my `home' directory.
I am therefore trying my luck by sending a request for help to this
newsgroup in the hope that someone will either recognise and have an
answer to the problem or will be able to tell me where this inquiry should
be sent to in order to get an answer.


I might add that I have no problems in preparing a text offline, copying
the text to the Windows' clipboard and then pasting it into the
appropriate area when in Pine's Message Composer.  However, if I wanted to
send two different Email messages in the same session, then I would be
history.


Thank you in advance to anyone who responds to this request for help.

That's pretty cool until you've learnt to crop your quotes. Maybe
you'd like to rm /usr/bin/sendmail, too?

Hello,

I don't know if this is the right place to ask it, but any help will be
appreciated: how can I activate the "secure mode" of Pico?. I've been
looking the source code, and I found some #define's about this, but I
don't know what to do with them...

Thanks.
Rodolfo.

Dear all,

	I was wondering how I can convert my pine addies to eudora format,
as I am cancelling this shell account on the 14th. I saw the message from
Svein skjaeveland (Convert Pine Addressbook to Eudora Nicknames
(addresses) 1/17/96) but his site at
http://www.interguru.com/pineudo.html seems to be down. If any of you
could help me out with this asap, it would be much appreciated. Thank you!

Dear all,

	I was wondering how I can convert my pine addies to eudora format,
as I am cancelling this shell account on the 14th. I saw the message from
Svein skjaeveland (Convert Pine Addressbook to Eudora Nicknames
(addresses) 1/17/96) but his site at
http://www.interguru.com/pineudo.html seems to be down. If any of you
could help me out with this asap, it would be much appreciated. Thank you!

simply don't use newsfetch. pine can grab news on its own. use the D key
to "delete" things you read that you don't want to read again (it marks it
as read, and does not delete it from the server. it could be clearer about
that for newbies, but :)  ) 

just keep it set up as it is, just don't use newsfetch
simple as that :)

Hello:

I have an alias e-mail address and would like to automate the moving of 
incoming e-mail to that alias from the INBOX directly and into a folder
with that alias name. Has anyone done something like this? How?

Thanks

If you want to remove newbie questions from this list, try removing the
suggestion on the Pine Web page that people should email their questions
to this list. Or at least state your above description on the Pine web
page.

Since I began using pine I have had a number of problems which I was
unable to overcome eventhough I  did read your mannual.I have
a text in wordperfect 5.1 format more than 700,000 million byte.Question
1)how can I send this text using pine; 2)if this is not possible into what
form of data should I convert to send it per pine.I shall be very much
glad if you were to promptly respond to my queries.

(1) is it possible that you mixed up some numbers? You are talking
about sending a file of 700 GB ... quite a story.

(2) if you've tried send a mail with your document inserted into it,
the sendmail agent fails (I hope, I haven't mixed up things here). 

So, here we go ... provided, the file is less than, let's say, 2 MB
which I regard of as a reasonable size to send via email (use ftp in
other cases or split the file), try to attach the file, that is Ctrl-J
while you are in the header region. This converts the binary data into
ASCII and sendmail (or whatever) won't complain about it.

hth, norbert.

This is a followup to a pine weirdness I experienced recently in case
anyone else runs into something similar.

Pine was behaving truly sluggish at times when the user tried to save a
file (it took about 30 seconds and there was no network/nfs server/imap
server bogging), and I believe it was due to a large time skew between the
imap server and the nfs server.  (The nfs server being a Netapp Toaster
whose clock battery is evidently suffering). 

I'm always amazed how simple some solutions turn out to be. Perhaps there
is a correlation between effort and simplicity... 

Cheers,
-Caroline

Hello all,

Here's a thought.  How about just sending a message that reflects the
following sentiment.

"Wrong type of question for this forum."

When the individual gets so 'MANY' responses back from the entire (lots
anyway) pine group they will have figured out that 'hey, maybe this is
the wrong group to ask'.  This might be preferred instead of other
options (no names) that have been used in the past to try to turn people
away.  All that does is - well - nothing.

OK it might be frustrating at first but you are reading your mail
anyway, aren't you???  Like this one for example...

...and as mentioned before, who has the time or really wants to moderate
a list for a large group like this?

Mike...........

Hello:

I admin a site which runs version 3.96.  Is there a command line option or
compile time option that would allow me to hide some of the main menu
options, such as Setup and folder index?  I have checked through the man
pages, and checked through the configuration files without success.

Thanks in advance.

don.

Check through the file called tech-notes.txt. You can fix configuration options
that users cannot override. There's no need to hide Setup from users; numerous
user-configurable options have no security implications. Why prevent users from
changing those?

What possible reason could you have for hiding the message index? How do you
expect users to get conveniently from one to the next?

You had better explain in greater detail about what you want to do.

I have been using Pine 3.95 for sometime but have never been able to get
it to print for me from the Y command.  I have an Epson LQ 850 printer and
am able to print from the "print scrn" key.

I have read and re-read your "help" message and have tried different
settings but to no avail.

What suggestions to do you have?   

Verney Unruh

most likely you would want to find out the name of your campus mail server
and set up pine on your home PC with the proper information.

Yo, brother,

chant a couple of "man quota"s - that'll help. What's happening is
that that you local system administrator has assigned you a limited
amount of diskspace which you've exceeded. That need not necessarily
be mail, it can be all sorts of files. Do the following:

   du ~/ | sort -n | less

and see where the big files are. You quit less by saying "q". Delete
those files at random.

Cheers,
Robin

You deleted the dir you were in.

BTW, you know that you're fscked when you get this:

No. This is a list for the discussion of problems related to the pine MUA.

OK that solves one matter alone Mike....it deluges *that* individual with
mail which says that they've posted to the wrong list. Agreed without
reservation. Yessir...that tells 'em...noooooo question about it!
However, the larger issue is not what you do to Joe Schmo, the one poor
schlemiel who gets 99,000 emails (98,999 of 'em from Robin!) telling him
he's in the wrong place, but what you do to *avoid* getting irrelevent posts
to begin with.
IMHO *that* is the issue, and where we're heading by trying to figure out if
there should be two lists, one for newcomers (er inexperienced NEWcomers)
and one for the folks who realize fully what the heck the list is for, and
who post on (or close to) topic.
A Regarding moderating the list...well for starters, a few boilerplate email
text files would certainly reduce the workload considerably. Time to
accomplish this? I dunno...anyone have any estimates on this??
Oh well...back to the iron foundry

well maybe I'm dumb and I don't really get what you are heading for,
but as I can see the famous combination of keystrokes should be

c -> compose message

Then, while in the header region

ctrl-j -> attach file(s)
ctrl-t -> to files

This last command opens a file selector. Since I suppose you are on a
Windows Machine (who else would use a backslash to separate
directories?) you'll see one of the famous explorer pop-ups which
you can use to move around (maybe to user/diss) and get the file you
intend to attach.

You might even be lucky that you'll 
(a) get those keystrokes above via mouse (don't know, don't care)
(b) get the desired result
(c) not get shot for disregarding pine's online help ...

l8er, norbert.

Is there a plug-in or helper application for NETSCAPE that will

If so, please email to STORY@health-chelan-douglas.wa.gov

Did you write a mail to isuck@netscape.com? If so, it went astray and made
its way to the pine discussion forum. We don't use Netscape and we *don't*
use ms-tnef.

Yeah, sure...

WHat does it mean when the computer says "disc quota exceeded" and refuses
to let you forward messages or save messages in any of your folders?
How do you fix this problem?
As I am typing this letter, the message : NO room for file, disc quota
exceeded just appeared at the bottom of my screen!

I guess you're under UNIX. If so, when you're reading the message, type v
to go to the viewer, then a list of the parts which form the message are
displayed, you should then place the hightlight over the part you want to
save (in this case, the picture file), and then press s in order to save
it to the current direcory... at this step a line asking you to enter the
name under which you want to save the file will appear, enter a name,
press enter and voila! :) 

Do you want to get it to your local computer?... well, ftp it from the
UNIX server  with any ftp client (like CuteFTP in Windows, for example).

Saludos.
Rodolfo.

You have run out of disk space, I guess...

> How do you fix this problem?

Delete some files from your directory, or ask your sysadmin to increase
your quota os space... use the quota command to learn about how much disk
space is available for you... also use the df command to see if there is
enough room in the filesystems to send mail (sometimes if some areas get
full, then you can't send mail). Use the man command to learn about the
quota and df commands: man df & man quota...

I received an attached file with e-mail from Canada(a photogragh) and it
apparently needs to be converted with binhex 4.0. 

I have an IBM compatible PC with Windows 95, msPicture-it and Easyphoto.
None of these will open the file('the files format is invalid or not
supported' etc).

HOW DO I DO IT?

So you see your file in the directory.  OK.  Type 

sz filename

Then it will download your file.  Then you can view that file later with
whatever program you choose.

If you wanted it on a disk, I guess you could copy it there after.  

Windows Explorer could copy the file to your drive A: (supposedly).
Somehow.  Or make a wish.

Let us hope Robin doesn't spam Jennifer.  As she needs help.  Beware.

Since Robin is repairing his hard drive, permit me to offer one or two
observations on his behalf.
1. Hit "V" to view the message parts
2.Hit "S" to save (for example an image like a .gif) to your local drive
3. FTP the image down to your local machine using WS_FTP or some similar FTP
program (freeware)
4. Although admittedly a minor matter, it's a gracious practice to
capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence, and (usually)
the first person is represented with a capital "I" as opposed to "i"
5. Things are never quite as much of a catastrophe as you think when you
write an email. Give thought to what you are asking, and whom you are
asking. It's unwritten, but recipients tend not to appreciate jumbled syntax
and poorly composed email such as you sent below.

Subject: configuring pico
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

hi everyone!
i love using pine and pico as the preferred editor (on a unix platform).
however, i do need to set the tab size to 4 (for work purposes). i was
just wondering if there was any way to do this, as i cannot find any
similar configure commands on pine/pico. any help on this would be greatly
appreciated. thank you.
ps. i know how to do it in vi, but i hate vi and any clones/associates.

Hi, just a guess after a glance ...

the only fast solution I've found is a recompile (hmpf) after a change
of the following line ...

mswin.c:8253:#define TAB_SIZE       8

maybe you could send in a patch making the variable user definable :-)

Now listen sweetie ...

we're here not at grammar school, sure enough, but you're hell of
lucky that you've received an answer at all. You don't know anything
about a thing called netiquette, do you - really? Have a look at your
f*cking subject ... what do we learn about your problem during the
study of it? That either the operator or the keyboard is broken -
probably both ...

So, just shut up and take the answer as given (in short, get lost).

Malcolm ... hmm, imo it's the 'o' that's lacking :-)

l8er, norbert.

Yes, use ^L  (CTRL-L)
It is used to re-draw the screen but checks also for new mail.

I believe I saw it in "Technical Notes" somewhere.

It's called Nettiquette, hon.  One thing to make note of, though..
If after asking for help from technical people (that's us), they
actually answer your question, but raz you in addition answering your
question (whether the teasing is playful or not playful is irrelevant),
it is usually not a good idea to attack them, especially with foul
language on a list that is public access. (Little children could read it..
and we all know how impressionable little children are..)

The main reason for this, of course, is that technical people (that's us)
don't respond well to attacks.. they tend to blow up planets and such. (I
knew one fellow who blew up a planet just because someone said he had
funny ears...)

Another good reason would be all the flames you will recieve in
response. (This letter is technically a flame.. I would call it more of a
spark though, since it is rather mild).

Of course, a great reason not to be a
shmuck and "bite the hand that feeds you" even if it is a little rough, 
is that you probably won't get any help if you ever ask again (technical
people [that's us] usually have good memories).

Anyway, that was just my 2p

Clark

Darn you, I was gonna point that out :P~

Reminds me of the time when I just graduated from HS and put "Honors
Curiculum" on a job application.  The only response I recieved (via US
Postal) was a note reading "Blah blah.. position has been filled.. blah..
P.S. - If you want to emphisize that you took advanced classes in High
School, you should probably spell 'Curriculum' correctly."  Of course,
being a cocky little @#$@, I HAD to respond with a letter stating "If you
want to criticize someone for spelling, you should be sure your own
spelling is perfect first.  The word 'emphasize' is not spelled
e-m-p-h-i-s-i-z-e."  I did not get a reply.

I normally ignore both breaches of netiquette and responses to same, since
life is _definitely_ too short. Although I agree with the previous sender 
[ie if you insult a list, you are unlikely to get help from it] I _would_
ask people generally to bear in mind that there are people with real
spelling/grammatical problems out there ie non-native English speakers and
people with dyslexia. 

I should know;- I live with a dyslexic, and have difficulty in communicating 
with his brother [a friend] since he is also dyslexic, and very reluctant
to send email to anybody, let alone lists or newsgroups because he gets
flamed on these points. I should also add that he is one of the most
competent people, technically, that I know. He has tried spell checkers
and various other IT solutions, and they have proved inadequate [words out
of context etc]. Speech to text may solve the problem in the near future,
but it ain't yet really adequate - especially if you have an English, not
an American, accent!

So, please, next time you feel inclined to hit somebody over the head
(metaphorically) for their spelling or their grammar, consider your
immediate reaction first:-)

I must strongly protest your use of the word "schmuck". For technical reasons,
girls can't be, er, don't have, er . . .

Well, the goyim shouldn't use Yiddish. It's dangerous.

I'm new to this list, but can I offer my opinion? The question may not be
been asked the best way, and the rebuttal was very inadvisable. However, I
believe that we're flogging a dead issue here, and getting off-track
besides.
That's just my two cents, of course.

Howdy;
every time I open my e-mail, a notice telling me  that I  have a (quote)
Bad context: no "[" in listserve" comes up and I don't know how to correct
the bad listing. Perhaps you could help me on this, although the error
certainly does not seem to affect operations. Thanks, Mark O

Face it, Adam.. the populous has hijacked many wonderful Yiddish words and
bastardized them to fit situations not appropriate for them.  Perhaps
Yiddish will become the national language?  Or maybe just the preferred
slang of the masses.

Hey..  "Go yim!".. sounds like something you would hear at a Japanese
baseball game. :P~

Jennifer;
    Ahhh, please excuse my delay in responding to your email. I was picking
my fragile ego up from the floor and attempting to fix it with Super
Glue(tm)
    You still are not capitalizing your 1st person references ("I" as
opposed to "i"). Declarative sentence structure still needs considerable
work. "Tell it  *to* you"???? Your usage of that structure is interesting.
One could surmise that you were born to a different native language...Arabic
perhaps? Maybe English instruction in Iraq isn't quite the thorough process
we might all have thought it to be.
    Spelling is definitely below par, the last time I checked "pompous"
contained an "o" and asshole (in current profane usage) is generally written
as one word. It is preferable to avoid the use of profanity (pun...noooooo!)
when responding to public forums such as this.
    Talleyrand, a noted French philosopher, raconteur, and judge of good
whiskey observed in 1823; "Swearing is the means by which the lowly and
inarticulate choose to express their buried rage" Given that he seems to
have been right on the mark with numerous other profound observations made
during his "dark period" this one is certainly food for thought.
    Last but far from least Jennifer, do yourself a favor before you descend
into the bottomles pit of the lowest common denominator (The new, ignorant
and learning-challenged Internet user). Learn the rules of composition,
spelling and what has come to be known as "Netiquette". If you have such a
sensitive nature, respond to a person with sardonic wit, finely tuned
sarcasm, exquisitely gracious charm and good humor. That way, you really get
your point across, and frequently elicit an apology from the offending (sic)
party. You will most assuredly not receive one from me.
    Oh yes, lest I forget. You commented on politeness, or the lack thereof.
Apparently the method for retrieval of attachments suggested by myself (and
I now find from numerous other kind list members, as is customary on this
most exquisitely polite mailing list) worked as described. The party that
erred in faling to observe the standards of politeness and gracious behavior
is you dear lady, not me. It is customary to post a brief "thanks for the
advice to all list members who posted the answer, (it) worked like a charm".
Once more, your plebian origins are apparent, nowhere do I see anything that
approximates such a simple acknowledgement (although the listserver has been
known to be slow...once on November 18th 1996 if I recall).
    So dear lady, perhaps you should "retire and consider" as Lord Nelson
commented at Trafalgar. Next time you post to a list, be sure you are on the
moral high ground, and when you venture onto Internet mailing lists,
rememeber that they are ribald lively places, where the thin skinned and
insecure should not venture.
Hope this helps, and the best of luck to you.
-Colin.
(Oh, maybe that should have read "Bon Chance Madameoiselle, et au revoir"
that way, you couldn't fault the politeness aspect, but ohmygosh, there I go
again!)

Hmmmm, you are without doubt correct, and the rebuttal was not one that I
would normally have elected to post. Once in a while however, I read
something (allegedly) written from the halls of academia...advanced academia
at that, not 'yer high school dumbkopf which makes me want to a) scream b)
vomit in disgust.
It's your taxes and mine that fund what we laughingly and erroneously refer
to as the education system. That post was almost inarticulate, whining,
appallingly written and pathetic.
It got to me, and I was obliged to fire a sarcastic reminder of that back at
the offending party, together with the answer to her question I might add.
Inadvisable??? Yes without question, and not my customary response. I don't
regret it, but I do agree with you that it's off track. Ask yourself
however, how the hell do people like that wind up in college?
A colleague of ours, (now attending to hard drive problems so therefore
absent temporarily) would have been measureably less kind, and the person
concerned would have kicked in her terminal screen upon receipt of his
advice! Mine was mild....almost tepid by comparison.
Anyway...back to the subject at hand. I'm done.
-Colin

Did you read the help pine gives you? Hit "?" in the saving screen

Sure. It's all described very well in the documentation that's available
for pine, and it's sometimes system-specific (i.e. I don't know if you're
allowed to mount a floppy if you're on a u*ix system).

> /what can i DO???? 

Stop shouting, start reading. Go to the pine website and grab a copy of
the documentation. It's worth reading, anyway.

This is not a bug in pine. Talk to your local system administrator about
it.

Jennifer and others:

She is right.  If this flaming must go on, why not direct the flames at the
person who deserves them rather than clutter up the group?  I for one have
recieved very helpful feedback from the group. Some people are nicer than
others, but then again, the information provided here is free.

I must say though that Colin of all people on the list seems to try to get
reactions like this.  His attitude is relatively condescending when
responding to people he assumes to be less technically endowed.  If he were
to cool it down a little on his tone, these kinds of people problems
wouldn't be so widespread within the group.  But then of course, maybe Colin
is british and that is just a tad bit of Irony and Sarcasm :)

I will shut my mouth now, I have expended my 2 cents.

P.S.  I apologize for assuming Colin is male if they are female.

Yo!

My harddisk is still falling apart, XEmacs is still dead, and I just found
that an MUA that doesn't sort mail and display threads *sucks*.  Did I
mention pico? No? Ok, pico *sucks*, too, but my .pinerc... Well...
.pinerc: I/O error

Anyway... I fired up my response to Jennifer's orginal message regardless
of the thread that had already developed, because the responses were
buried among 896 other messages. If, however, I had read the entire thread
beforehand, my reaction would have been entirely different... 

1. Jennifer: you're no fun, and you don't have a clue, either. Please get
   one from a local brainware store. Get yourself a spellchecker, too.

2. Adam et al.: I don't just flame people? I've been on this list for
   some time and I must say that it's getting less and less fun. There are
   almost no technical problems here anymore. Instead, we get newbies
   (which was alright before the People at the Pine Tower decided that
   this list be the forum for technical discussion). Some of these newbies
   just don't have a clue. Now, you might argue that this is what newbies
   are like. NOT! I still maintain that *every* newbie ought to have read
   the netiquette or at least the stuff her ISP had handed out to her. I
   may be old-fashioned, but I will *not* give up easily. If someone comes
   to this forum looking for help, I expect her to maintain a minimum
   standard of politeness. And I don't mean crawling, I mean:

	a) a sensible subject (Jennifer, "HELP!!!" *sucks*, ok?)
	b) a meaningful signature (.signature: I/O error ]:-< )
	c) consulting at the very least pine's online help, because it's
	   good and easy to understand
	d) due diligence in composing one's message - pine offers a spell
	   checker, and the reader can expect a minimum standard of
	   readability. Jennifer: it might take us (nota bene, we're just
  	   users, we're not the pine team, ok?) some time to figure out a
	   solution to your problem and type an answer. It's not asked too
	   much of you to spend a little time to proofread you message, is
	   it?

3. The people who offer free advice deserve a) respect, b) gratefulness,
   c) worship ... ooops! Ok, let's put it this way: when you get a
   helpful answer to your problem, don't start bitching because you get
   mildly toasted for your various violations of the netiquette. Noone
   told you that you suck, we only ridiculed your poor "grammer" and
   spelling. If you cannot live with that, get *commercial* support, ok?

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++

As for life in general: my harddisk is still broken. This sucks. XEmacs
and mutt already went down the drain. For some reason, pine still lives.
Must be Murphy's. pine is not a good mailer for me. Not at all. It doesn't
sort mail, it doesn't do threading, it doesn't score (well, I do, but
that's not the question, is it?) and pico is an abomination. I hereby
request that pico be replaced with an editor that does propper wrapping
and indentation and which can be made aware of vi or Emacs keys. Did I
hear anyone say "joe"?

Hmmm... yeah... broken hdd's suck.  This might be the last message for two
days. Go visit my website while you can, I got this really cool picture of
me and my girlfriend up: <http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/>.

Jennifer, you might want to go here:
<http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/pine.html>. 

If anyone should feel the irrestible urge to send me a reply, my address
is: robin@franck.pc.uni-koeln.de. 

I want my new 9GB drive - now!

Later,
Robin

Why not? Messages like the OP's have become a common trait here. This is
not a Good Thing (tm). It does not acutally "clutter up the group",
either. This list was supposed to be for technical problems. Well, that
doesn't seem to work. So it might be used as a forum where one can, well,
do some educational stuff.

This is positively incorrect. It's also demeaning my articles. Shame on
you. As a matter of fact, noone here is trying to get even more stoopid
lusers on the net. On the contrary. Colin was making a very valid point
with his article. It's not nice to hop into a mailing list, asking for
information that is at your very fingertips, and it's suicidal to flame
people that offer you free help.

> His attitude is relatively condescending when responding to people he
> assumes to be less technically endowed.  

Whiner. And it's *not* condescension you're experiencing here, but mere
frustration, because "we" are becoming a minority - "we" meaning people
that know what they're doing because we did in fact spend some time
reading the documentation. You know, the pine docs are rather well
written, and it doesn't take much time at all to read them. Personally, I
cannot even begin to understand how one could not be able to download a
file when all the necessary steps are explained in the docs _and_ probably
a handout by the young lady's university.

No. If he were, this would be the most boring place on the entire
internet, because there's no input whatsoever from the kind and gentle
people like Ray Cummins and Annelise Undersome.  There is, however, input
from people like Colin. Take it or leave it - it's free and it's up to him
if he want's to flame some luser for violation of the netiquette or not.

> P.S.  I apologize for assuming Colin is male if they are female.

Geez, get a life... PC is dead and we've come to bury it.

Subthread? What "thread"? Pine doesn't know threads. You're on the Pine
mailing list. Stay *on* topic, ok? Duhh...

thank you for your reply, norbert. this was bout the only thing that i
could come up with, though i must add i hadnt had an idea where to
start/what to edit. my proficiency is not as great as i would like it to
be, though creating a patch that would make this value user-definable
(preferrably somewhere in the main menu) would be a GREAT idea. im not
very versed in diff files or such either, nor have i the technical
expertise to do anything of the likes. perhaps there are any takers????
thanks again,
Oleg

It may be removed from there, but it may still be found during a search
using Dejanews.  I've found archives that I've mailed to the list from
well over a year ago.

The way I usually prevent others from reading my mail is to set the
permissions correctly for the directory containing my folder
collections.

On un*x systems: chmod 0700 $HOME/mail (assuming the default)

On some windows systems via explorer -> permissions, i guess

Well, hth, norbert.

*arg*

afaik pine gives you some hints, for example v(iew) and s(ave) the
pic. Now, for un*x systems you can use something like xv to display
the file. If you have a windows like machine, try one of the paint
tools that come along (or use netscape).

About the use of spell checkers in mails have a look in the thread
'help!!!!!!!!!!' and related subjects.

l8er, norbert.

Sorry Robin.  You are actually the most condescending of all, and for that
shame on you!  I didn't mean to try to take away your crown and give it to
colin.  Do you have a real job by the way, or is your job to monitor this
list during the times when your hardware isn't falling apart?  Is being a
student all that you do aside from your *contributions* to this list?



>
>Whiner. And it's *not* condescension you're

Actually Robin, I didn't realize there was a tone of whining in my
statement.   I was just offering objective input, which you felt the
adolecent need to twist.  Aren't you really the whiner?

This point is well put!  Why don't you just reply to people with this rather
than belittle them?

Indeed, and I am sure that you are one who wants to see Sadam Hussain
conquer, because of course, without excitement from dictators like him, the
world would be a dull place.  Maybe you should should try being kind and
gentle, people would react in a much more positive way.  I certainly would
have.


There is, however, input

Your opinion on who is a looser is clearly misguided, and less than
subjective.  As for Mr. Colin, his advice is what it is....Free.  The old
cliche about getting what you pay for has never been more applicable.

Oh Yeah moron, I forgot, being polite is not what you have been complaining
about, it is all about netiquette isn't it.  Of course, there is no
corolation between nettiquette, politeness, and PC, or is there?  You must
be at least 18 years old Robin aren't you?  By the way, this comment was
included because after being on this list for quite some time, it wasn't
until yesterday that I realized you were not a female.  Or should I say
bitch, because that is how you come across at every point you enter group
conversation.

I have a small piece of advice for Robin SWM.   Without endusers, there is
no reason for you.  Without developing software/operating systems that
others can use easily, Bill Gateus will succeed in killing all efforts to
battle his OS's.  Fix the www.enemy.org link you have under your Microsoft
link on your web site.

It's amazing to me that someone who professes their intelligence and
education as you do can act like such a child.

don't expect further posts from me regarding this, as it has already wasted
more time than I have to offer.

So tell me please, I'm curious....What have *you* contributed to the list
lately?
What knowledge have *you* passed on to newcomers?
What contributions have you made to anyone's understanding of the email
program known as Pine?
Or is your coontribution confined to commenting acerbically on the responses
of those who *do* contribute, *do* flame when needed, and *do* add to the
otherwise bland nature of a technically oriented mailing list
You entitle yourself "Speaking Freely" as well you might. Think for a moment
about yur reaction to others who IN FACT speak.....Freely.
I'll treat your comments more seriously when you render some assistance, as
oposed to sitting in the gallery booing the players on the stage.
If in doubt, read the above once again, and keep doing so until you
understand that unless you are contributing or learning, you have NO place
here!
-Colin

You can't, exactly. 

Try using a web browser (lynx if you're on a telnet or dial in un*x
account or netscape or <gag> internet explorer) and going to
http://www.whowhere.com
another place to try would be
http://www.yahoo.com and then click on either people search or white
pages, I don't remember which one it is there.

Hmmm, using Pine you couldn't period. It won't "search". If you are looking
for an email address locally, i.e. on campus, there may be other means to
accomplish that.
What you could do though, is  with a web browser (using lynx if you want to
stay within a UNIX environment) is go to http://www.bigfoot.com, or
http://www.switchboard.com  and search for the person's email address by
their name, and (if you know) state.
Depending on how new the person's email address is, you may well be able to
locate it via these search mediums. It is possible that you won't get any
hits if the address is really recent. Try it anyway to see if you get any
results.
Good Luck with your search!
-Colin.

Windows or explorer and system are contradictions in terms, Norbert.

You don't need to, darling. Education is probably lost on you, anyway, since

Oh, dear... my, my... Ummm, would you mind if I said that you've got no
clue? I  haven't seen any input from you whatsoever. I've seen a lot from
Colin. Any yes, you did in fact whine. I mean, what's your problem? You
don't seem to know anything, otherwise you'd be helping. You have not been
attacked, yet you feel you need to comment. You don't know Latin, yet you
use the word "objective" without knowing what it acutally says.

I must really suck to be you. Listen, Dearoldmum, there's users and there's
lusers. I would have told a user exactly that. In fact, I did. But Jennifer
turned out to be a whiner. I don't like whiners. People that get a
Terrormail account and Outlook Exploder 99 and come to this list and start
whining that there is no Download Wizard or sm-tnf-converter and the like.
This cannot be it. This is a technical forum (although right now it looks
more like a kindergarten) and we still get a very high noise ratio. Ever
wondered what the rest of the net is like? If I tell someone "go read the
documentation which you can pick up here and which was put there by the same
wonderful people that made pine available for free", I get some 5 f*cked up
lusers like you telling me that RTFM is not a polite/valid/whatever answer.
FUD. I don't need this crap. I help where I can, and that's that. If noone
told people like Jennifer that the way they behave sucks and makes the net
a lousy place to be, they wouldn't even know. I don't think they care, but I
want them at least to know. Go figure.

I didn't say "looser". I said "luser". But you don't care, cause you joined
the net in 97 and it's a really cool place where you can hang out and chat
with many people who are all nice and gentle. Of course, I am misguided, of
course my opinion is more than subjective. So? Were you trying to make some
point by stating the obvious, Dearoldlamer?

Hmmm... pico doesn't rot13 regions. Not good. Ok, let's put it this way:
you're a rebel without a clue. You've apparently no idea of the technology
you're using, otherwise I would have seen some input from you. But I
haven't. Still you moan and whine and generally suck - big time. What's you

Partly. The netiquette is about getting along with other people in the
absence of corporal punishment. PC is a communist tool for manipulating
freedom of speech, putting loosers into positions they don't belong, and
demeaning democracy in general. My M.A. thesis was about language
manipulation by totalitarian regimes. PC is Goebbels reborn. No Goodwin
here, just empirical findings. You loose.

No, there isn't. If there weren't any, there would be no reason to improve
Linux software.

He's got more than one? What year is it at your place? Here in Germany, it's
1998 and there is no MS "OS" in existence. There's Dos and NT, both of which
are no operating systems by Unix standards.

This a problem that I have ask about before. When I get mails from user
of MS Exchange or outlook and they have the edit setup to be ms word
then I can get the email and read it but it has trash at the end. I have
call exchange support and I was told that this was fixed in pine 4.0
here is the test of message the I got from exchange support. It seems
that the people at Exchange support are wrong and I need to call and
tell that.

thanks Marty

>Where is the command in Pine to save a attachment in html format?

There is no such command, nor should there ever be one. You'll have to use a
Web page editor. If, perchance, you were sent an attachment already in html
format, use the v command, and save the appropriate attachment to a file in
your home directory and naming it with an extension of .html. Then, read it
with your browser.

When you're reading the message, press v, select the part of the e-mail
you wanna save (the html attachment) and press s then you'll be prompted
to enter the name of the file you wanna use to save the attachment, you
can use the default name, enter your own one, or use the CTRL+T to use
Pilot to browse your directory tree and then select a name. I recommend
you use the default. Pr4ess entrer an voila!.

Or you can do the following:

at the unix command copy the file /etc/mailcap to your home directory and
name it ".mailcap".

Edit your .mailcap and make the following modifications:

1.	Locate "text/richtext; richtext %s; copiousoutput

2.	add these three lines

	text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-1 %s; copiousoutput
	text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-8 %s; copiousoutput
	text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-7 %s; copiousoutput

3.	Save file and run pine...

4.	Voila, you can now view documents sent in HTML codes as HTML
	codes (TEXT).

Don't run pine just yet.

3b.	Edit your .pinerc file

	Search for pattern "mailcap" and modify the following line to
	reflect the new change:

# Sets the search path for the mailcap cofiguration file.
# NOTE: colon delimited under UNIX, semi-colon delimited under DOS/Windows/OS2.
mailcap-search-path=/usr/home/highway/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap

Dear Everett,

thank you for choosing a Microsoft product. We appreciate your information
about MS Exchange's inability to create an RFC-compliant mail format. We are
painfully aware of MS Exchange's shortcomings and are currently working on
an upgrade which will be available shortly. It will be a trimmed version of
MS Exchange and will probably called "mail" for obvious reasons. Since our
R&D team have recently found that the use of a GUI for a mail application in
fact decreases the program's user friendliness, "mail" will be run at the
command line prompt. We envision a simple syntax for the use of "mail", e.g.
"mail foo@bar.com". In order to make it RFC-compliant, it will not support
RTF, HTML, or binary attachments. "mail" will only run under NT, though, but
we will offer a special bundle price for the upgrade kit, which will also
include KerNeL! 98, Fdisk Plus and an improved version of Write
("WriteNow!"). 

Yours truly,

Robin S. Socha M.A.
CEO German Web Force

Dear M.M.COLEMAN,

thank you for choosing a Microsoft product. We appreciate your input on MIME
and cool photos. However, we regret to inform you that you need to upgrade
Windows 95 to Windows NT in order to view cool photos in MIME format.
Windows 95 currently only supports blue screen pictures in GPF format.

You don't think Robin has a minor dislike for Microsux Winblows products,
do you?  Did Bill Gates beat you as a child, Robin? Or do you just prefer 
real operating systems (Oh wait.. I forgot Win95 isn't an OS, but a GUI
for an OS.. oh wait, that was the original Winblows, I guess Win95 is
actually an OS, with a TUI (Textual User Interface, IE "MSDosPrompt" ;)
for those people who actually care what the computer is doing.. I'm so
confused..) :P~

Pat (I do Windows cuz it's 'hip'.. and all my toys are in Win95 format.)

Dear Sir,
Two days ago, I received an email from
pine-robot@docserver.cac.washington.edu which asked me if I like to use
the new version of pine. It said there is only a little change so I said
"yes". But then I found that the new version could not fit my email system
or the maching. It destroyed many fuctions and documents. If possible,
please help me cancel the new version and let me still use the old
version. Or, you can tell me how to do it by myself. Your help will be
greatly appreciated!
Sincerely yours,
Jian Teng

And everything in life has to be totally and completely constructive.
Don't laugh.  Don't eat food that has taste.  Think only constructive
thoughts.  No education should be in any way pleasant or entertaining.
Yeah, right.

Some of us appreciate Robin's wit.  If you don't, procmail him.  If you
don't see his attempts to help people in straight forward ways as well as
entertaining ways, then don't read his email.

Greetings,

I just installed PGP for Linux 5.0, and am trying to integrate it with
Pine 3.96. I'm using the sending-filters config option to invoke pgp as
follows:

/usr/local/bin/pgps -fat		(this is like pgp -fast in 2.6.2)

pgp accepts the input from pine, asks me for the pass phrase, and reports

Success! Press return to continue

I press return, and Pine informs me:

> Problem filtering: Success <

and doesn't send the message.

What am I doing wrong? Please cc me as i'm not yet subbed to pine-info.

thanks,

brian

Dear Everett, Marty,

Thank you very much for your quick response. We regret to inform you,
though, that we do not acutally sell "Purpose 98" as a plugin for MS
Exchange or Outlook. However, we highly recommend using Microsoft's powerful
ascii-editor "edlin" in its stead. This might possibly solve your problems
with non-RFC-compliant email messages.

The MS hotline, which is only $3 /min will certainly help you out with all
the necessary information.

If you should have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact
us again.

What operating system are you using? Without this information, there's
nothing we can tell you.

Could you please be a little more specific on this one? What did Pine
actually do, and how would it destroy documents?

Again, we need to know your operating system. If you're on a u*ix system,
which one, and which version of pine did you install.

Well, there is ample instructions at the pine website (where you possibly
got your copy from, too). 

Cheers,
Robin

Simply hooking in pgp as a sending filter won't work. Check the pine
archives for the addresses of pgp sending filters already in existance, e.g.
papp by Aldo Valente or pgppine by Roland Rosenfeld.

That's because there isn't one explicitly... instead there is the much more
general (and useful) "customized-hdrs" setting, which allows you to add any
extra header you wish (not just "Reply-to:").

Read its online help for more info.

Oops... That's "customize headers" in fact:
OPTION: Customized-Headers

You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing messages.  Each header
you specify here must include the header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.  If you want to see
these custom headers each time you compose a message, you must add them to
your default composer headers list (see above), otherwise they become part
of the rich header set which you only see when you press the rich header
(Ctrl-R) command.              

Sorry for the confusion,

MD |N>K
you are just in high form today, robin :)

btw - I would have sent this via email, as it is rather off topic,
however your email address (uzs8kb@sushi.uni-bonn.de) fails.
sushi.uni-bonn.de does not have an MX record..or indeed any record. I take
it this is purposeful?

I have recieved a few requests for the filter, but noone has given me any
feedback yet as to whether they like it or not.. go fig...
Anyway, now is as good a time as any to resend the info, so here goes:

Pat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of you are familiar with pgppine and papp.

A friend of mine and I have taken a copy of papp and performed practically
a total rewrite on it.  The program has many of the old features, like
saving your password encrypted in a session key, but also has some handy
new features, and MUCH more readable output.  If you would like to help us
test it (We haven't found any bugs in it with pine v3.96 and pgp v2.6.2),
just drop me a line.  NOTE: this program is available by request only
until beta testing is completed, then we will post the perl
script wherever.

NOTE: be sure to include something in the Subject of your message
pertaining to beta testing, as my mailbox gets flooded from time to time.

Also, any suggestions as to other places to go for beta testers
would be appreciated.

Thank You,
Patrick Farabee

First I want to think the people that helped me on the last problem, in making
a reply to address.

Next, I'm not sure about this one either, is there anyway to change the "From"
field?  I have this account, but I also have a virtual domain and obvioulsy,
to inflate my ego, I want to use the webmaster email address.  Can anyone let
me know if you can make such a change in Pine?  Thanks.  Forgive me if I'm
just ignorant.

Assuming that you gave your correct email address.

I have a few problems with your recent post to the pine-info mailing list

On Fri, 16 Jan 1998, Claudette wrote:

First: it is clear that you aren't using pine. This :

  [NON-Text Body part not included]

tells me that you are sending non-rfc compliant email. For more
information I suggest you go to
http://www.isi.edu/div7/rfc-editor/rfc.html and do an appropriate search.
"mail" strikes me as a good one. (I dont' recall the most recent rfc
number. sorry)

Second : mailing lists are not a good or appropriate place for you to post
your commercial advertisements. it is not appreciated and I can pretty
much assure you you won't get any customers from this list.

Third:  the url that your banner is advertising does not exist. therefore,
you annoyed the subscribers to this list pointlessly, as you really will
not get customers if no one can find you.

Fourth : the software you sell is used for spamming, from the sound of it.
Spam wastes bandwidth and disk space. Spam is killing the news system.
Email spam is inconsiderate, especially to those who have to download
their mail via modem connections and had to wait for your banner. It also
may be illegal, depending on where you live.

In other words, don't do it again.

Yes. Grab the tarball for your system off the pine site and say
	grep -i -5 changing_from
on the tech-notes. Follow the instructions, recompile, install.

Yes, you are. Read the docs, that will help.

Ok, now its starting to get interesting.  How can I make it show the
customized headers to the recipient?  This is what I have done:

The first thing that I did was play with the custom headers.  Then I turned on
the full headers option (CTRL+R) and there they were.  However, when I went
back in, I saw that there were also default headers.  I tried changing it to
let me adjust the "From" header, and it told me I couldnt do that.  Then I put
in the regular headers and the custom ones from below.  Yeah.  Well, once I
had saved those changes I went again to compose another letter.  However, only
the regular headers were there.  This wasnt cool.  What was going on?  So I
changed the custom ones back to their own respective custom area in the
settings, and did a full header command again, and filled them in and sent it.
Aggh!  This time, it sent fine, and I mailed it to myself.  Aw, this is just
great.  It doesnt show the custom headers unless I have the full header
command on!  Is there anyway to force Pine to show those headers that I want
it to see?  Say I want my friends to see my website.  I want a header to say:

Website:  http://www.foo.com/

It only shows up in full header display.  Aw pooh, I was hoping to sneak that
one in.  It's getting interesting, although it's kinda a tease.  Boo.  Can
anyone help?  Thanks in advance.

Greetings,

Thank you for your previous suggestions. However, I am attempting to use
PGP 5.0 with Pine, not 2.6.2. 5.0 has different calling semantics, and I
am having quite a bit of difficulty porting any of the suggested solutions
to PGP 5.0 due to these semantic differences.

I would like to instead address why pine returns >Problem filtering:
Success<...

"Success" is not generated by pgps, pgpe, or pgpv (the pgp executables for
pgp 5.0) so it looks like it's added by Pine's filter layer. But if Pine
is returning success, why does it die with "Problem filtering"...I'm
afraid I don't understand.

tia, and please cc me.

-brian

Since this mailing list is hardly being used for its intended purpose, Robin's
purpose has been to keep me entertained. Thank you, Robin.

Yup, there's a really easy solution readily available to you called a
signature file (otherwise known as a dotsig or .signature) and it's a bit
more elegant than twenty header lines.
Two methods of accomplishing what (I think) you are looking for:
1. quit pine, and at the command prompt do a:
pookie.guts.com$touch .signature
pookie.guts.com$chmod 755 .signature
pookie.guts.com$pico .signature
(this brings up the default text editor and your screen will be blank,
because it's a new and empty file you've brought up)
at the top, type something like the following:
------------------------------------------------------------<separator line
don't type this in, just a version of what's below it>
Mike Cross
http://www.phatboys.com/
mailto: webmassa@phatboys.com
"If you can't convince them, confuse them." -Harry S Truman
------------------------------------------------------------<separator line>
Try (please) to limit your dotisg to maybe five lines max if it's feasible
(it is in your case) and follow the format shown above.
OK, next do a ^O (Ctrl O) and you'll see a "File Name to Write .signature?"
hit enter and there will be a couple of brief messages that flash by. Then
hit ^X (Ctrl X) which bales you out of pico.
OK, now you have a dotsig, now how do you incorporate it into each email you
send? simple. Get back into Pine and on the main menu screen hit "S" (Setup)
"C" (Configure" and tab down the selections to signature-file. If it reads
<No Value Set: using .signature> then leave it alone, if it reads
differently, hit "C" (Change value) and type in .signature) then tab down
almost to the end of the first section of configurable variables until you
see signature-at-bottom and check that by hitting enter or hit the "x" key.
Now hit "E" (Exit Configuration) you'll see the message "Commit Changes
("Yes" replaces settings, "No" abandons changes)? and hit enter or "y" for
yes to commit the changes you have made. Now hit "C" for compose, and voila,
there will be a .dotsig which will remain at the bottom of each email you
send until you decide to ever change it or delete it.
I gave you the "real" way to create a dotsig, although Pine will do it for
you if you go to setup/configuration/signature which is a bad way of
learning anything about Unix. Follow this method, and you've learned several
things....how to create a file from scratch, change it's permissions (never
mind too much about that for now but it's there anyway) and open it, edit
it, save the changes, and make it work within your email environment.
Hope this answers your question, and if so, we expect you to post to the
list using your new dotisg!!!!! Don't worry if it's goofy to begin with,
just about everyone has a goofy dotsig in the beginning. You'll change it as
time goes by, everyone does.
Good Luck!

Dear listmember:

I would like to apologize for sending my unprovoked attacks yesterday and
the day prior to Robin and Colin for flaming the newbie.

I said things about them that were unwarrented and definately not
appropriate.  I don't personally know either one of them, and I made
unjustified statements about them.

I also sent those messages to the group without a valid return address, and
that was most rude.  If you were irritated by the post from Speaking Freely,
that was me.

I am sending personal apologies to both of those gentleman immediately.

Sometimes, even people who have been on the net for a while act
inappropriately and I certainly did.  I know that I will attract some flames
for revealing myself, and I deserve them.  Please direct them to me
personally, as I don't want to further impact the list.

I am sorry,

Don Allaire.

Robin:

I don't know you, and I have enjoyed your humor on the list for the past 4
months or so.  I had no bad intentions toward yourself or colin when I
placed the posts to the pine-info group.  After doing so, and driving home
the long drive that I do, I started rethinking my actions, and realized that
I was completely wrong in my postings.

I would like you to know that I actually appreciate people like yourself who
try to prevent ego maniacs like bill gateus of Borg from trying to take over
the computing planet.  I work at a larger US Corporation, and I have steered
them away from NT for their Internet functions, and use FreeBSD exclusively
in that area.

I actually am well versed in Netiquette, as I owned an ISP with 3000+
members,
and we had to give them talks about this frequently.  I never intended to
even respond to you, until I read the last line of your post back to me when
I responded about Colin flaming Jennifer, the part about PC is dead and
buried.  When you read something, and you write something back in the heat
of the moment, especially over email, it is easier to be a complete butt
head
than when speaking to a person directly.  I lost my composure and I
apologize for doing so in a public forum.  My comments were far from
accurate toward you.  It just seemed that lately, the list has had more and
more unfriendly responses.  As you noted, this is directly correlated to the
increase of rude and inappropriate messages to the group.

I am far from a saint, and I again apologize for acting like I was.

I do hope that you find it within yourself to understand and forgive my
harsh words.

Sincerely,

Don Allaire....no longer Speaking Freely.

Hi

I get email sent to me written in http.  To read it I save the file
attachments and then read the message surrounded by http.  I couldn't find
a way of setting up mime types to cater for this.  

Is there a quick way to instruct the Pine viewer to display messages it
does not know how to deal with, or is there a way to instruct pine to use
another viewer on command, like lynx?

Regards

John Heenan

It's seemed to me that one could pipe it through lynx (that only works for
un*x systems, though). But my computer has been loathe to do that. 

However, that was my old one, my new one seems to handle viewers and such
much better. Maybe I should try it again. (better hardware, more current
version of linux and pine, etc)

anyway, said commands would be V(iew)(highlight the appropriate
attatchment) | lynx

oh, and you have to set that in the configuration.

I don't know if this will work, though. it just should theoretically

Folks,

Don and Jennifer have been abducted by aliens! They were good people and
deserve better than be replaced by soulless clones. Is there anything I can
do to bring them back, please? Maybe something that will also make pine
filter mail, do threads, yank properly, and forge my from: line - and fix my
hdd? It'd be pretty cool if it would also get me some Coke, pizza and
cigarettes...

TIA,
Robin

No, Colin, it isn't. I'm too tired to check the son-of-rfc-1632 or
something, stuff like urls goes in the header.

pookie.guts.com? Cute. But why on earth would you touch a sigfile and...

make it executable??? and then

use this abomination called pico to edit that file, instead of simply using
the sigfile option available on the M(ain) screen?

> ---------------------------------------------------<separator line

Colin? Back in the days when XEmacs roamed my harddrive, I had this:

;;* This one takes care of fucked-up signatures
(setq gnus-signature-separator
      '("-- *$"		; The standard
	"^-- *$"        ; A common mangling
        "^-------*$"    ; Many people just use a looong
                        ; line of dashes.  Shame!
        "^ *--------*$" ; Double-shame!
        "^________*$"   ; Underscores are also popular
        "^========*$")) ; Pervert!

That's "-- " and nothing else? dash dash blank. Some programs use this
separator to do fancy stuff with signatures. Pine doesn't, btw. Some
programs put sigdashes in automagically. Pine doesn't. Why me? Why my
XEmacs? Why not pine? I want my Gnus back... *sniff*

Unless your hdd is broken, you don't need the email in there - it's in your
from: line. The URL could use standard format, too: <URL:http://foo.bar.com>
to make it clickable. Pine doesn't do that, btw. *sigh*

Colin? You have just taught the young man how to do about everything
feasible wrong. But that's ok, because this is not gnu.emacs.gnus, but the
pine discussion forum, and the only reason we're here is because we are nice
chaps that enjoy a good laugh once in a while. Technical problems do not
really belong here...

Yeah... Some people have really cool stuff to change their signatures:

;;* Use random signatures in message-mode
;;  written by Matt Simmons <simmonmt@cs.purdue.edu>
(require 'random-sig)
(setq random-signature-head (expand-file-name "~/.sigfiles/HEAD"))
(setq random-signature-dir  (expand-file-name "~/.sigfiles"))
(setq message-signature 'random-signature-fun)

I wish things were as easy as that with pine.

Thanks for your reply Vinnie.  

I have been able to add an /etc/mailcap entry for text/HTML to enable HTML
to be shown.  Part of my original problem was that text/plain was not even
being displayed.  This problem has been fixed up also. It appears http
emailers also send a plain version of http. 

An /etc/mailcap entry that worked for me is
text/HTML; lynx -force_html -dump %s; copiousoutput

With regard to piping the output to Lynx, I don't think there is a way
within Lynx for it to accept a html file to be proceesed from standard
input.  However piping the output to a script could set up a file for lynx
to read from and then send output to standard output for the viewer.

hmm. I think you're right..I mean about lynx not reading from standard
input. it would (more or less) explain what happens on this machine when I
try to pipe it. (nothing explains what happens on the last machine, except
perhaps the fact that it was held together by duct tape, bailing wire and
velcro)

Time to fire up vi and write a script.

-force_html looks useful too. I don't know why I havne't seen it before.

Robin, as I understood his question (please excuse the assumption, I know it
can be dangerous) It appeared as though he wanted to display a URL in each
email message, ergo a decent use of a dotsig.
Headers are rarely understood by the average user, but if there was a
different purpose, then I stand corrected and stand down on this issue.

Dear Fellow List Members,
I am pleased and delighted to welcome Don back...if I recall correctly, (I
may be wrong here) but I believe he's a prolific and knowledgeable
contributor to the Redhat list.
This gentleman has class and courage to post an apology to a worldwide list,
and I encourage everyone to pause and give this action he took some careful
and (sober) thought.
As he stated, he has indeed sent me a personal email, and I am publicly
stating that I received it in good faith, and responded in an honorable
fashion by way of acceptance.
I personally hope that if I ever do someone a real (or perceived) injustice,
I will have the humility and courage to take an honorable course of action
such as this, especially in light of the fact that he could have appeared on
the list under his own personna and no one would ever have known he was the
one who took a couple of us to task.
Now perhaps <grin> we can get back to Pine, and toasting the occasional
individual who darkens our doorway with Microsoft or Armadillo pest control
requests???
Hey Don.....welcome!
-Colin

Usually.  I've seen one lately that didn't.  Since I hadn't gotten
this set up till now, thanks to you folks, I'd just skip it.

This is what got it working.  I tried the script below; it would
display the message which was unreadable otherwise (unless I saved and
viewed the file), but it still contained all the HTML tags.  The one
above works; the one below didn't quite cut it:

text/html;lynx -force_html %s;test=test -n "$LYNX_VERSION"
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-1 %s; copiousoutput
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-8 %s; copiousoutput
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-7 %s; copiousoutput

I tried piping it through Lynx which was suggested earlier.  I was
using the four-line script above (haven't tried it with the new
one-liner, but it's more work to do that anyway), and it just locked
up.  Couldn't suspend the job; could only cut the connection and
re-logon, so I think I'll stick with the one-liner.  That fixed the
problem.

Hello all technical masters,

I am facing problem while forwarding my mails to some executable program.
I want to develop the filter and for that i need to forward all the
incoming mails to some executable program.
For this i had written the line 
|"/home/sapan/a.out"
in my .forward file....
where a.out is the executable program..

Although it is forwarding the mails to the program but the returned mail
is also generated specifying that unknown mailer error and cann't forward
mail to 
/home/sapan/a.out@localhost

Thanks,

Why arent't you using procmail right away, Sapan? Its language provides for
exactly these tasks. Take a look at Nancy McGough's mail filtering faq.
BTW, your signature is way too large.

Have you asked your brother that the accounts are still valid? If so, his
server might be down for maintenance or something similar.

Hello!
I have a little problem here....
My problem is how can I get a copy of my news mail - without read it - to
another account?
There is any possibility to do it?
It is like a automaticaly forward, but Pine keeps a copy in my pine's
account....


Please reply to biscoito@bigfoot.com

You will need a filtering system for that. You didn't state under which OS
you're running pine, but let's presume that you're using some flavour of
u*ix. The first step is to grab a copy of Nancy McGough's filtering mail
faq, the address of which I don't have right now because it was eaten by an
I/O error. It's in the pine FAQ, though, which you will want to read,
anyway.

Then you decide on which filter you want to use (probably procmail) and if
it is installed on your system. Then you go about reading the procmail man
page by saying "man procmail" and "man procmailex". Basically, all you need
is a simple .procmailrc as described in procmailex.

Good luck,
Robin

My University of MD. email account is having problems. I have too many
messages, but I'm trying to delete them and it doesn't work. The message
says that there is a system's error and I need to press s for Shell to
clean it up but it will not delete my messages. Could you please advise me

Hi, Diana,

you're having a quota problem. You should discuss that with your local help
desk. I've never seen your error message, but have you made sure that you're
only running one instance of pine? That could be another problem, because
running multiple instances of pine will render all of them read only.

Ok, well, I've tried quite a few things now.  

I can get the stupid mail clients like Netscape et al to show the new headers,
if it is set to show full headers.

Pine obviously does the same thing.  Bummer.  Ok, now in a fit of rage last
night, this is what I tried.

I type in, telnet mail 25.

Then I do the helo, mail from, rcpt to, and data.  When I get to data, I put
in my own headers.  Blah. does this sound right so far?  Well, then I go "."
and send.  I get the mail, same thing.  Only shows the defalt headers.  What's
up with this?  Isnt there any way that I can force the headers to show up?  I
guess not.  If I send myself an email from Netscape to Pine, I bet the odds
are high enough that I wont see that infamous "Organization" header that
Netscape always has to squeeze in.  Let me try that...

Yup, I was right.  So I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that the only way
that people are going to see the headers that you want are by leaving the full
headers on all the time, and this day and age with so many bounces, forwards,
and carbon copies, no one wants to leave those on.  I guess that I probably
should just give up, huh?

Ok, I figured my last problem.  

Only thing that I cant figure out, now that I've decided what just cant be
done, is how to change the "from" header...

I don't agree.  Here's why

a.  That standard format looks too codey.  I don't like codey looking
stuff.

b.  It's confusing looking.

c.  More chance that a long URL will not fit on a line.  You're just
making a longer line.  Too many characters.  And also, whoever's e-mail
progy may wrap lines.  How's ya supposed to follow it if it takes TWO
lines?!

d.  Would you expect everyday people to just type in all that, whenever
they mention a URL? I expect not.

Mike, leave it like you have it.

Yeah.  So don't worry about sig.'s until people make universal EASY
methods to write them, and context sensitive inclusion.    

BTW, I don't like Sig.'s, take away Kbytes of message space.

2nd BTW, didn't someone just post here saying her e-mail program shut
down, now inoperative, based on file space overflow?  

If anyone likes Sig.'s, why not write my postmaster from the hostname, or
her postmaster.  And ask them to increase the general quota.

Ok---- here's my Sig.

For the 2,642,423rd time, pine must be compiled with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM. It's
not a user-configurable option.

Andrew, it's standard. I don't care what you think looks codey or not, if

Guess you're easily confused.

No, Andrew, I'm using the accepted standard for a URL. Nothing more, nothing

Yes, Andrew. Certainly.

Tech problems do belong here. One of those problems was my broken hdd.
BUT... Linux is not Windos, so I had a new running system with 60 minutes.

Andrew, it cannot get much easier than with pine, although (HELLO!!!) the
sigdashes should be standard when editing the sigfile.

Andrew, the miles of stuff you didn't crop in your reply took a lot more.

Oh dear... Mymy... Well, I certainly could tell Gnus not to save signatures

Excellent. Andrew, you are totally meschugge.

It sucks. Plain and simple. Thanks for your valuable input, Andrew. Next

Ummm... I beg to differ. If everything's working ok here again, this line
would do, too:
	rc.config:FROM_HEADER="franck.pc.uni-koeln.de"
I mean, if you can recompile, you're the admin, anyway, right? I have the
strong suspicion that Mike is trying to set up a stand-alone system. This is
the easiest solution.

Interesting, but you haven't followed your own standard before.  You
have given URLs, not in the above form.

Second, a message body does not go by any "standard"!  People type in it.
Actual human beings.  You can type any word you want.  It will be included
in the message body.  (You can type German here too, as evidently you
have.  Even though this is an English speaking group.)

Standard, and who uses it?  I think you prefer argumentation anyway.
Robin prefers disagreeing to agreeing.  :-)

So you think it's a nice standard to have when 2% of Internet users may
use it?

Don't need to know HTML for an e-mail program.  HTML is not considered
acceptable in e-mail and on usenet.  HTML here is not *standard* usage.
Nope.  

HTML is for the Web.

You are most clearly quoted above.

My my what?  What does Gnus have to do with PINE discussion forum?  What

My my, did she say she was using Gnus??

Or... Were you planning to send her the installation files for it, and

Yes, Andrew. Those I put in manually. I'm lazy.

Indeed, Andrew, indeed. However, I cannot quite follow your logic here. Just
because it can be altered by the user, a sigfile has to comply to the same
standards as any other part of an email. Think of linewidth, headers and
quotation marks, Andrew.

[URL standards]

I don't care, Andrew. I don't care about what lusers do, and what Microsoft
does, and what you think is correct or not. It's the accepted standard, and
it's not a standard made by some sadistic morons, but experienced admins and
the like. Have you ever wondered if there might be a reason *why* those
standards are set?

[URLs spanning more than one line]

Certainly. But some MUAs are aware of URLs, and therefore, you need to
comply to the accepted internet standard for typing URLs. Otherwise, those
URLs don't work and you might as well not use them at all.

No. At least I'm not aware of any. "We" seems to be the other members of
this list. Right, guys?

[random sigs and signatures]

No, Andrew. I was talking about how easy Gnus is to heavily customize in
contrast to pine. Then I said that creating a signature with pine is easy.
Can you understand the difference, Andrew?

[bandwidth and diskspace wasted by sigfiles]
> Whatever "miles" you may be referring to, no one would be able to follow
> the thread if everything was cropped.

Certainly, Andrew, certainly.

[quota problems by sigfiles]

It has features which pine sorely lacks. Since this is a discussion forum, I
feel entitled to comment on these shortcomings from time to time, Andrew.
Any objections from a technical point of view?
[...]

What's objectionable about Yiddish, Andrew? And I'm not quite sure if your
knowledge of Latin would suffice here...

You're most welcome.

            Aspen Achievement Academy
Financing   Aspen Ranch
From:	    Bobbi42@AOL.com

  To whom it mat concern;

       We are the Grandparents and guardians of 16 yr. old Jeffrey Dyer . He
has lived  with us for almost two years. They have been very difficult ones.
We have  decided that our public school system does not have the ability to
help our grandson mature into a espected, mature gentleman. I have since
transferred him to Aspen Achievement Academy which is located in Loa, Utah.
This  wilderness treatment program is committed to guide students and their
families toward internalizing principals and developing skillswhich facilitate
positive personal growth. This treatment program lasts for about 50 days.
After he completes that course on February 18th,he will move on to  Aspen
Ranch. These facilities are recognized and licensed by the Utah State Board of
Education, to operate as a special alternative school designed to effectively
reach students at risk. I am hopeful that they will reach Jeff. He is a third
year Freshmen and has failed this semester, due to absenteeism. If we do not
reach him soon, he will become another one of those drop-outs. Jeff needs to
be reeducated. The therapists think that they have a chance to accomplish
this, because he is responding to them. 
    We are close to retirement age and do not have the funds available to
sponsor him through the completion of these programs.We do not receive any
help from his parents, although  we are expecting about 390.00 a month from
his father, which is long over due child support. I do not have my hopes up
very high because he has contributed an embarrassing small amount of funds so
far. If he does, it will renew my faith in man kind, but it will not be nearly
be enough. His mom does not work,
because she has two little babies to care for. So that leaves the remaining
financial deficit to us. We can come up with  about 700.00 a month, but we are
still short about 2850.00 a month. Times that by  9 or 12 months, Wow! That is
expensive. 
      Jeff has experienced Rejection all of his life. His parents were
teenagers when he was born, and they never married. His father was very
abusive to both he and his mother. His Mom married  when he was 11 years old.
Three years after this blissful occasion, Jeff became very unhappy and out of
control. His behavior at school was outrageous. He became more and more
involved  with the police. He ran away, was extremely aggressive toward his
mother, began hitting  and attacking her with ugly intimating  vulgarity. He
was also aggressive toward his Step Father. I was not there to witness any of
this, but the out come was final.He was completely fed -up, and proceeded to
kick Jeff out of His house. This is when We took him in. We too had our
problems. By this time he thought he was a polished manipulator. He did not
respect us or our  rules. He stole a great deal of money from his
grandfathers business, and from our vacation fund, he took my car for a joy
ride, with out my
permission or a license, he used abusive language on me in hopes of getting
his way. Between  his truancy and his horrible conduct, I realized that I
could not help him. The only recourse I had left was to get him some kind of a
treatment program. So on  December 30th, of last year, he left for Aspen.
Achievement Academy. We have exhausted all of our resources, including the
money I set aside  to pay our   property taxes, to place him there. Jeff is
very much worth the sacrifice that we are making. He needs to continue his
treatment, which means he will move on to Aspen Ranch. This step will further
educate him scholastically and emotionally. There just is not enough of our
money available to help him. 
Can you help us by sponsoring him? It would be a wonderful answer to a prayer

Hi, 
	We are trying to use PINE 3.96 on a box Running AIX 4.2.1.  The
executable we have was precompiled for AIX at UCLA.
  
PROBLEM:  when sending a new message the following message appears:

   "[Sending mail |     0%   |]"

and Pine just sites there with the percentage never changing from zero.
We end up having to kill the Pine session.

NOTE:  We are able to send messages with the "mail" and "mailx" commands.

I've seen this at times...forgot the exact conditions.  The problem had to
do with which options pine was using when it called sendmail.

To "workaround" the problem rather than change the options and recompile
I simply set:

smtp-server =

to the fully qualified name of the local host.

in my .pinerc file.  In the case where you are servicing a large community 
it would be advisable to put that information in the system wide pinerc
file.

Regards,
Ed

Not enough information to help too much....

Chances are it is a local problem as these seem to be valid addresses.
Can you tell us *exactly* what the error message states?

Thanks,
Ed

Try:

"|/home/sapan/a.out"

as the position of the " marks can be significant.

If that fails, then try something like:

"|exec /home/sapan/a.out"

However, be advised that sometimes systems are configured to not allow 
delivery to "|".  You should also worry about possible abuse.

If what you want to develop a mail delivery program....then take Robin's
suggestion and get procmail.  They have already done the job and taken
into account most of the worries.

Ed

Sorry, I can only help you with the Coke and pizza.  However, I thought
about the transit time and decided it was best that I consume those items
in your stead and just tell you how they were.....

Buuurrrrrp....ahhhhh.

I use TELIX v3.22 to communicate with the Pine System at the Kitsap
Regional Library and a I have a serious problem.

Apparently, the Pine system, when in the mode to accept hand typed
messages, will not accept ASCII transfers. This makes it very difficult to
send pre-made messages.

Also, from time to time what I am typing gets bounced around to different
places on the screen and sometimes overtypes what is already there,
including the header, not to mention the characters that occure that I
dont type (resembling control codes and the like).

Just for the record, this connect has been doing the above mentioned
things and my connection rate is at 1200, in spite of trying to connect at
33.6k. When the connection was made, it first showed a rate of 26.4k.
Something is wrong and/or confusing.

BTW, ASCII Transfers are really very important to me. I am also not very
please with the commands that require Control-this and Control-that. I run
a BBS on a Commodore and even that computer accepts Cursor keys along with
the standard . (dot) or / (slash) codes used in BBSes and wordprocessors.

I modified papp to use pgp5.0 syntax, and I can send it to you, but your
problem is related to a bug in libc, I think.

Well, there isn't too much we can do about the line quality of dialups in India.  
However, this should not be too much of a problem if you have a good modem with 
the proper error correction features enabled.  I also do not know what SW/HW you 
are using to connect to VSNL.  I suggest you contact the helpdesk at VSNL for 
assitance in problems with your connection.

Regards,
Ed

The current version of Telix for DOS is 3.51.

You are attempting this while in the pine composer? There is nothing to
configure on the pine end. It can't even be blocked in the system
configuration. As far as pine can tell, it is equivalent to accepting input
from your keyboard via your terminal emulation. It works on my system.

It is possible that you corrupted Telix. Try to install the current version.

What terminal emulation did you choose? Use vt102, and make sure your TERM is
set correctly in your shell.

Surely, you know that your connection rate has nothing whatsoever to do with
pine. I cannot help you on this mailing list.

What the hell are Cursor keys? If your terminal emulation were set correctly,
you could use the Arrow keys, or at your option, the Function keys in lieu of
Control key combinations for many tasks. pine can bind the Delete key itself,
and you could bind Home or End yourself within the Telix program.

Hi Ruben,

This question has been asked in the past and since my company will eventually
upgrade to AIX 4.2 I saved the replies.

I haven't tried them but here they are:

Reply #1:
	We fixed the problem by loading the sendmail program from AIX 4.1
	in stead of the one included with 4.2

Reply #2:

	I had the same problem, you can fix trhe problem addinng the next line
	to the pine.conf.fixed file in /usr/local/lib directory.
	
	sendmail-path=/usr/sbin/sendmail -t

Have fun,

Sandra

OK, time to weigh in on this, I'm out of cigarettes and this is
intolerable.
Bobbi, some points for you to bear in mind (not in order of priority)
	1. Soliciting charitable donations via mailing lists is considered
fraudulent.
	2. AOL's TOS (you know what those are, don't you) expressly
prohibits what you are presently doing.
	3. This is a mailing list devoted exclusively to the use of an
email program known as PINE, nothing else...period.
So, here's what I am (personally, not purported to be on behalf of this
mailing list, University of Washington, or any other member) going to
suggest to you in the strongest possible terms. You should pay attention
to this, treat it seriously, and act upon it immediately:
	a) Cease and desist from sending solicitation mail to
pine-info@u.washington.edu.
	b) Upon receipt of this e-mail, reply to all recipients, stating
that you have read and understood, and accept the contents, and that you
agree not to send further mail to the list.
Failure to do both of the above will result in me contacting the TOS at
AOL, and having your AOL account suspended. 
You may care to note that AOL is increasingly concerned about the actions
of their membership, and will take action swiftly to prevent you from
sending any further solicitation email.
I encourage you to do this, because if I personally see another
solicitation from you to this list, I will immediately take the action set
forth above.
Your reply, stating your agreement to the terms is awaited.
Regards,
Colin.

Read the filtering mail FAQ by Nancy McGough and install a filter on

Is there any way that I can import files with large numbers of e-mail
address directly into my address book.

What I now do is import the address file into the body of the message.
I then mark the address file portion of the message and delete it (mark
and CTRL-K). I then go up to the address portion of the message and insert
it with (CTRL-U).

This works but it would be a lot more convenient if I could get it
directly into a distribution list in the address book.

Thank you for you assistance in this matter.

Subject: Guitarist Seeking Musicians
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit
X-To: OSIRISMGR@aol.com
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,

I'm a guitarist/singer/songwriter/guitar synthesist looking for other
musicians to form a band and eventually tour and record CD's with. 

I have been playing for nearly 25 years in some form of a band or another and
am now in my mid 30's. I have a wide range of styles and influences 
although some of the music I write reflects a heavy fast paced rock style.
Some of my recent favorites are STP, Foo Fighters, Soundgarden....I even
like a few of the songs off the new Smashmouth album.....you name it. 
If there is a guitar playing through a Marshall it's my cup of tea. 

I should mention that I do like most styles of music and my writing suggests a
very broad range of styles from Jazz and Swing to the heaviest metal you can
imagine. I consider myself pretty versatile.

I have quite a collection of necessary equipment including PA and mixer and a
studio where I can play 24 hours a day 7 days a week with no neighbor
complaints. No more $350.00 a month lockouts.

I live in Missouri at present but am considering moving to Nashville or
another city that has a good rock and music scene.I've played in bands that
have opened for Creedence Clearwater, Three Dog Night, Blood Sweat & Tears,
just to name a few and have ties and experiences back to my home state of
California with other bands as well. I left the Orange County music scene in
1996 and moved to Missouri since not alot of bands were getting anywhere in
the LA scene (you know...the pay to play scene).

So I appeal to you at this moment in time to consider starting/joining 
a fellow musician who is extremely serious about getting somewhere in the
music scene. I would like to start off with getting a good solid drummer 
and bassist and eventually add another guitar player as well as a front 
man. I have about 20 original songs ready to play as well as an extensive
list of cover tunes ranging form 1958 to present.

I currently have a manager who takes care of all personel functions of the
band (past and present) as well as does all the bookings for the band and
other bands as well. (But this band is the main concern!)  This leaves the
band free to work on music - that's all we will ever have to worry about.

As far as upcoming gigs and performances....I (we including you) have several
opportunities to play this upcoming year in a number of large outdoor
festivals but I sure can't do it without you or the other players. 

If you are interested in finding out more please send e-mail to this e-mail
address: OSIRISMGR@AOL.COM   -  this is the managers e-mail address.
The manager can answer any questions you may have or forward a background on
myself to include a resume. I don't spend any more time on the computer than I
really have to

Thank you for taking time to read this and hopefully you will want to get 
started on a band that will definately get someplace. Or maybe you will know
someone to fit the bill to pass this on to. All help appreciated and may
whatever project or band you are in and don't want to leave - succeed.



Sincerely,

Gary

Could you ask your question a bit more specifically, I for one am not sure
precisely what you are really asking.

I have a problem at PhoneFree's homesite and it tells me to get the 
Application-Stream to correct it. Where do I get this program and what is 
the D/L file name & size.

Thank you,     Ed McMurray

I'm not gonna touch this one! I s'pose it's no good telling the individual
that if you don't visit 'em in the beginning, chances are (these days
anyway) you won't get unsolicited mail. <sigh> Please excuse me fellow
list members, I have this great 'pic of Daisy (The cloned sheep)  ohhhh,
those lips, that wool...er....I have to go to the bathroom...later all
<pant>

Subject: cannot print from filemaker pro

Hi,
My problem is simple :
It is impossible to print from filemaker pro 4.0
I've already reinstalled my drivers, I've already changed all my
settings to European standards namely A4 papersize but nothing works.
There is no problem if I want to print from another application.
Is there somebody who knows what could be my problem.
Thank you for helping me.

unfortunetly, that's not true. every so often I'll get sex-spam in
accounts that I used to post to non-sex news groups. it sucks. that's
life.

Dear Sirs/Madams:
	Sometimes, I receive e-mail with attachments and cannot read 
them.  I am prompted by the Pine system to save them.  Where should I 
save them?  How can I read attachments, especially image files?

	The Pine system is going to phase out in my university for an
unknown reason.  Is there a way to forward my e-mail in the Pine system 
to my new e-mail address which is not in the Pine system?

	Thank you.

Sincerely,

Kin Man Choi

If you want them, save them in your home directory, or on your machine at home. 
It's off topic, but someone may advise you on what to use for viewing if you
provide details of file formats. You could check the archives.

You will have to discuss with your system administrator what format mail will
be stored in. pine doesn't use proprietary formats.

Is your university eliminating Unix shell accounts? Really, we cannot know what
is in the mind of your system administrator. You must make further enquiries.

On a unix system? Do this:

   mkdir ~/Pics

then save the files there.

> How can I read attachments, especially image files?

Read? "cat <filename> | more" or simply "less <filename>". If you
want to view images, you need X (unix's window system) and an image
viewer, e.g. xv, xli, display or even netscape.

Sure, those are just emails. Two options:

1. Copy your old files to disk and put them on the new system.
2. Go to M(ain) S(etup) C(onfig) and "enable aggregate commands". Make 
   sure to read the instructions by hitting the "?" key. Then mark all 
   old mail and forward it.

Did I mention that pine does not support digests, guys? Or soup
packages for that matter? Gnus rocks, duhhhhhh }:->

For starters, there's no such thing in Sexchange or Outcast. It's in
your MTA if at all. If you want to make really sure, set a filtering
system with your correspondents that generates receipt messages. It's
a waste of bandwidth, but we do exactly that for important
correspondence.

That would be a no.
It would also be a suggestion to keep your spamming away from mailing

Well I'd sure like $35,000 to buy two DEC Alpha 4x600MHX processor
Screamers, a T3, routers, two name servers and a big chair to sit back and
look at all of it humming away!
You have reached a mailing list devoted exclusively to the email program
known as PINE. Most of us on this list are penniless (maybe not Ed, he works
for a "Big Company") and whatever our financial status, this isn't the place
to hunt for entrepeneurial start-up capital.
Sorry we can't be of any help whatsoever, but Good Luck with your search!

is it possible to change the Reply-To: and From: Header Tags to different
ones for each folder I use?
I have folders for each of my email-addresses, and I want to use different

not that I know of. In this case I advice you to start pine with
different, folder-dependent configuration files - not very
satisfactory, though.

And about the 'From:'-field: you know, recompilation is necessary with
the change allowed.

There is a header called "Bcc," which stands for "Blind Carbon Copy" that
you can use for that.  You can get the header to appear by selecting the
"Rich Headers" command while editing anything in the header section of
your message (IE while typing in the Subject)  The command for rich
headers should be listed at the bottom of your screen while in these
sections.  If you can't find the command, just keep looking.. It's there.
Whatever addresses you put in the Bcc field will recieve the message, but
will not see the other recipients of it.

With your cursor in the header area type ctrl-r to reveal the "rich
headers".  Then put the addresses in the Bcc: field.

Raymond;
You are out of control, and seriously off-base with this. Let me advise
you of a couple of things here:
	1. When you originally posted to this list, be advised that your
post was off-topic. This is a mailing list devoted exclusively to the
email program known as PINE, nothing else...period.
	2. Notwithstanding that, if a list member knows the answer to an
off-topic question, he/she will usually spend the time necessary to help
the individual.
So consider what happened will you?:
	a) You posted a question (off-topic) for help with terminal
matters.
	b) You were answered by Adam. (I saw your post and had I known the
answer I would have replied too, but I didn't) His advice was correct, and
his manner helpful, and he added the necessary comments he felt necessary.
BTW he was contextually correct.
	c) Your response to someone who tried to help you was abusive,
derogatory in content, ill-mannered, and you acted like an ingrate. You
reply was completely 100% uncalled for period.
	d) You then follow this whopping act of poor judgement with even
more rhetoric along the same lines????? For goodness sake, take a moment
and think about exactly what you did.
As a highly esteemed list colleague and friend recently observed to
another errant know-nothing on this list; "Being you must really suck.
People like Adam rule and you suck"
You owe Adam an aplology, have the sense of decency to (at least) email
him privately and do just that. Spare yourself public embarrasment and do
that decent thing. No-one is asking you to do as others have done, and
apologize publicly, that takes courage that you clearly don't have. Just
do it privately, and go away having learned something. You will otherwise
be judged by everyone on this list to be spineless, lacking any ethical or
moral standards, and not worthy of a response from any single list member
in the future.
-Colin.

yes, as long as you are running  a rfc compliant smtp server .. (at least
I'm fairly sure that Bcc is in the rfc.if it's not, well, flame me to a
crisp :) I'm too lazy to go check it myself) if you don't understand the
first sentence, then don't worry about it, the answer is most likely yes
(like in 99.99999% of the cases I know of..) If you're a really paranoid
sort, test it by Bcc'ing yourself about four times and look at the
headers, if you don't see it, no one else will.

If you are using Pine, the procedure is fairly simple.
hit "v" to view
"s" to save (the part of the message that you need to read/see)
This saves it to your local drive.
Use WS_FTP or similar FTP software to FTP it down to your local machine,
then you'll have to open/view it using whatever software it was
written/composed with.
Hope this helps, and good luck!

Hello:

I would like to get some info in the archives that helped me out.  Below is
a response I recieved from Richard Gering answering the question of why
don't the cursor keys work properly in Pine 3.96 with Wyse 50 and Wyse 60
terminals without doing a recompile of Pine.  Thanks again Richard!

Question:

I am running FreeBSD 2.2.2, and using the standard Termcap database that
shipped with the OS release.  We are running Pine v. 3.96.

When our wyse50 & wyse60 terminals log in, the TERM environment variable
is set to the correct terminal type.  When pine is run, the key
 mappings for the arrow keys don't work properly.  I have checked out the
 termcap database, and it seems to have the correct key mappings for ku,
 kd, kl, kr.  For instance, when I press the up arrow in Pine's main menu
 screen, pine responds with "^K is not defined for this screen".


Answer:

By default, Pine will not accept any key sequence that doesn't start with
an ESCape. This was done for historic reasons. There is a way to activate
full termcap/terminfo support though, which should give you what you want.

To accomplish this, append "-DTERMCAP_WINS" to the lines defining the
"STDCFLAGS=" in both pico/makefile.<os> and pine/makefile.<os>. Next, do a
complete rebuild: you're in business!

You should be aware that certain Ctrl-key based commands in Pine and Pico
will not work on a Wyse 50, since these commands are identical to the
values returned by some of the edit keys (which now have precedence).
Most noticeably Ctrl-^ (Mark) and Ctrl-K (Cut) will now act as Home and
Cursor-Up respectively.

To use Mark and Cut, press ESC ESC ^ and ESC ESC K instead. In Pine,
ESC ESC <key> is always available as an alternate to pressing Ctrl-<key>.

This "problem" can be avoided on the Wyse 60 terminals by selecting a TERM
entry that programs the cursor keys with ANSI sequences. Usually, these
entries have the extension "ak" tagged to then (for ANSI Key, I guess).

Hello:

This is again for the archives.

Question:

I am having a problem with the main menu highlighter bar displaying
incorrectly with all versions of wyse50 emulating terminals, and emulation
software.  The menu bar is wrapping the screen, therefore when one arrows up
or down, the menu bar gets very unreadable or disappears.

Answer:

While scanning through various termcap databases on Wyse50 terminals, I
found this helpful piece of info.  Apparently, wyse30 and wyse50 terminals
have an inherent standout mode glitch which occasionally cause problems like
the ones I experienced with the menu bar in Pine's main menu.

These terminals support a "PROTECT" sequence on/off that has no
 standout-glitch (xmc), while the regular "attribute" stuff enabled
 with <ESC>G'some-character' gives a 1-space glitch.

 All but the very old revision firmware on both terminals support a
 visible PROTECT attribute that's selectable by the ol' SETUP menu.
 (The older rev. terminals do support PROTECT attribute but only
  have the options REGULAR and DIM)

 Get into your terminal's SETUP menu, and down-key to the 5'th
 menu (on a wyse 30; I think 3'rd or 4'th on a wyse 50) and
 right-key over to the PROTECT item.
 Change PROTECT to REVERSE or REVERSE/DIM, and go over to the next
 item -- ATTRIBUTE and change it to LINE;  then save the changes.

The next thing that you will need to do is change your termcap database so
that it uses the proper escape sequences to turn on/off the protect sequence
rather than the very-ugly \EG4 and \EG0.

You do this by changing standout to \E), standend to \E(, and glitch to 0,
which means
changing the so, se, and sg fields to so=\E) se=\E(  sg#0

I actually didn't have to change my terminals in my circumstance, as the
terminal change had already been made.  However when I made the small change
to the wy50 termcap entry, the menu bar started working like it was supposed
to.


The above information was presented in the termcap database comments, and
written by steve@omni.com

I hope that this helps someone else as it did myself.

Correct.

The actual transport of email relies upon "envelope" information and not
"header" information.  When pine, or any other user agent, contacts the 
MTA to start a message on its way it will send all the receipient
information in the "envelope" but will not include it in the headers.

In fact, some user agents will take 2 transmissions to accomplish.

Dear Sirs,

I have one question: Is it possible using Pine 3.96, if one composes a
message to a distribution list, that means to several different addresses,
to send this message in one step in such a way that any receiver of the
message cannot read in the hader who else has got the same message? If
this is not possible I would like to make the suggestion to allow this
option in future versions of pine.

With my best regards,

Ulf Winkler, Leipzig, Germany

That was in comp.mail.pine yesterday ... while composing a message
move the cursor into the header region and press ctrl-r (rich
header). Then write the list of addressees into the field Bcc: (blind
carbon copy) and noone will know who else has got the message (even if
all header options are on, as has been stated in the other thread).

An even better way would be to use the Lcc: field.  Go to the Lcc: field
in the "rich headers" area and type ctrl-g for more information...

Hi Ed,

yes you may be right, but I wasn't sure whether 'distribution list'
refers to a mailing-list or to a list of recipients locally created in
the user's address book. But maybe, it's all the same ... I'm not that
much into pine (it's gnus, yes it is :-)

cheers, norbert.

Neither do we, with no information...Are you able to actually log
on to your account, or is that where the problem lies?  WHat is
the exact text of the error message you're getting?

Lets start there...

Sorry, guys...Robin, could you please e-mail me off-list with
your working e-mail address.  I don't have it, and the sushi one
is (of course) bouncing.

Thanky.

sounds to me like your computer and printer are not configured to talk to
eachother properly. Your best bet would probably be to get your local
techie type person to get computer and printer talking. Once that happens,
it's likely that you will be able to print out of pine correctly.

Meanwhile, try the {E}xport command. It saves paper :)

I could, but I won't since several people seem to have had problems with
that. My above address is valid and has been for months. Ummm... what do
you guys all do with your addressbooks? }:->

I know that Pine has the ability to allow for remote mail checking via
imap by changing the inbox path  to {server}INBOX.  My question is, can
you set up pine to allow you to check remote servers by selecting another
folder?  I see this as a useful feature.  If this does exist, how do I do
it?

I can save messages to a folder with a name like A&B but Pine won't accept
the '&' as part of a folder name in the header-option "Fcc".

Try quotes. Don't use special characters in pathnames. Never.

Your signature is too long, and lacks sigdashes "-- ".

Hello,

I know the trick mentioned in the email with the subject:"Pine & Cursor
Keys with Wyse50 and Wyse60 terminals" but I am working with AIX v 4.2.1
and it doesn't use termcap; it uses terminfo. 

I've uncommented the terminfo entry in ./pine/osdep/os-a41.h and it won't
work. ( I do have the Wyse terminal definitions installed ) I've tried the
-DTERMCAP_WINS hack with termcap support installed; that didn't work.

So now I'm looking at a source file called ttyin.c and in it I see some
escape sequences for various terminals. So, I'm wondering if there is
anybody who could tell me if I add the escape sequences for Wyse 50 here if
it would work. I only need the up and down arrow keys to work.


Thanks for you time and help.


Cheers,

Jeff

 I created a distribution list using pine, ( an e-mail list). I would like
to know if there is anyway i can hide the addresses of the mailing list.
So when i send out a list every address is not exposed to the recipients.
Is there a hide option I can use ? Any info would be great !!

Thanks

Put your cursor in the header area.
Type cntrl-r.  This brings you to the "rich-headers".
Put your cursor on the Lcc: header.
Type cntrl-g to read the help on Lcc:

Lcc: does what you want.

Subject: procmail or slocal?

I am trying to decide if I have to install procmail on my system or just use
slocal to make auto-responders.
The informations I've found so far have been rather cryptic and none mention
anything about auto-responders.
I'd rather try to get slocal to do it right now since it's already installed and
space is a bit limited for now.
Could anyone help with some pointers on how to setup slocal to handle
auto-responders?

I would like to know if PINE 3.95 has the capability of setting REPLY TO
ALL RECIPIENTS to a default of NO?  If so how do I go about setting the
default option to NOT reply back to all recipients?

[rest of error message]

is it possible that the separator (semicolon, isn't it) is wrong? I've
just had a look into the tech-notes:

The address field takes one of two forms, depending on whether the entry is a
single (simple) address or a distribution list. For a simple entry, the
address field is the email-address part of the address, i.e., the part that
goes inside the brackets (<>). It is combined with the fullname field to form
the complete address. For a distribution list, the <address> is in the format:

          "(" <address>, <address>, <address>, ... ")"

just a guess, norbert.

Cliff,
Contrary to the message from your MTA, the so-called "group" syntax
  foo: ;
is valid, i.e., is compliant with the standard... but not all MTAs
accept it.

Two choices: upgrade your MTA or replace the To: address with any
conventional (non "group") address.  Don't leave the To: field blank or
some (other) MTAs will add an "Apparently-To" line for each recipient.

That looks right. ": ;" is a signal to sendmail that addresses that follow
should not be placed on the To header.

                        ^          ^          ^
It's the address list itself that must be comma-delimited. But, that has
nothing to do with the ": ;" that is placed on the To.

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest
* Filters out duplicates
* Keeps track of URLs already visited
* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week
* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
 Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
 Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
 Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

I suppose by system you mean WinBlows XX, because who else would try
to attach a WORD document?

Anyway, while composing a message, press ctrl-j (attach file) and
either enter the name of the file or press ctrl-t (to files) in order
to get a directory tree which you can use to search for the file.

Btw, the pine online-help is *very* well written and able to answer
your question right away, afaik. Also it's a good idea to look for the
options, presently given.

I hope this is *not* offending and I haven't missed any details.

l8er, norbert.

Try the context-sensitive help. There is a help topic for every function and
option, and each header in the composer. Just hit ^g.

If you are using Unix pine via a shell account, upload the file to your home
directory. Enter the composer, put cursor in headers, ^j and name the file to
attach, fill in rest of headers, write an explanation in the body, send
message.

In addition to the other messages, which were helpful, it should also be
pointed out that VSNL has not seen fit to upgrade their version of pine.
You are using version 3.91 which is "old".  Pine is now at 3.96 which
offers the ability to so file uploads and downloads from within pine.

IMHO, a lot of the problems are created by VSNL.  They are a government
run ISP and they give little or no service to their customers....

Rick,

Go into PINE's FOLDER LIST screen and check the context-sensitive help for
it -- see the section on "Valid Folder Names" near the end.  One fictitious
(so far ;-) example given there for accessing a remote folder other than
the INBOX on another server is: 

	{monet.art.nowhere.edu}~/mail/september-1994

well, it's sort of fictitious. I got something like that to work on my
machine.

I have four email boxes

INBOX /var/spool/mail/drachen
{mail1.eni.net}abuse
{mail1.eni.net}drachen
IN.testing /home/drachen/mail/IN.testing

It sorta works. It requires much going in and out of pine. I'm working on
refining now.

Try the Microsoft hotline. They're brilliant technicians with a very

In addition to previous responses regarding Pine folder collections, you
might also want to consider defining multiple *incoming* folders, so that
it is easy to check for new mail in them simply by using the TAB command
to automatically cycle through them from the INDEX screen.  (Pine will 
stop and open the folder only if there are new/interesting messages
in it.)

To do this, first, set the "enable-incoming-folders" feature, then use the
ADD dialog in the folder collection screen, OR edit your pinerc to have
something like:

incoming-folders=STATUS {shivams.cac.washington.edu}status,
	IMAP {shivams.cac.washington.edu}imap,
	ACAP {shivams.cac.washington.edu/user=gray}acap,
	PINE-INFO {shivams.cac.washington.edu:145}pine-info,
	SMIME {shivams.cac.washington.edu:145/user=gray}smime,
	CompMailPine {shivams.cac:145}{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine,

Note that in my case above, I have different kinds of messages vectored
into different folders on the same server; that's done by a delivery
filtering too (e.g. procmail), but you might have different kinds
of messages going to different servers... 

Also note that the last line above assumes the latest UW IMAP server,
which will proxy between an IMAP client and an NNTP server.  That won't
work with earlier UW IMAP servers.

"Disk Quota Exceeded" means that the storage disk that pine normally writes
to is currently full, in this case, your account has been filled to
capacity.  You'll have to delete files that you no longer need to make room
for new files.  Since your storage disk is filled, you cannot save your
configuration file for PINE, and if the Fcc-Folder is set to a file in your
directory, you cannot save any files.

there's no room left in your disk quota. delete some stuff or talk to your

Well, no, I said "e.g. procmail"... that is "for example, procmail".  As
it happens, I don't use procmail myself (I use a user+folder@foo.bar
addressing convention), but I believe many do use procmail successfully
with IMAP, and I don't understand what the problem would be FOR SITES THAT
PERMIT SHELL OR NFS ACCESS TO THE IMAP SERVER and use the normal Unix
mailbox format.

For sites that don't meet the above test, the general problem of
user-controlled delivery filtering in a black-box, client-server
environment is, I think, still unsolved.  It's on our local list of email 
issues, but hasn't gotten much attention yet.

I believe some IMAP clients actually do pseudo-delivery filtering when
they start up by applying rules to the messages in the INBOX and stuffing
them back into different server folders according to those rules.   We've
resisted going down that path in Pine, because it is obviously less
efficient than doing delivery filtering all on the server at the time
messages arrive --but the client-based approach is a pragmatic work-around
to the lack of any standards or infrastructure for "doing it right".

So... could you clarify the problem you are interested in?

Hey all.

I noticed something peculiar today.  I run pine on a couple of systems, one
on 3.95 and the other on 3.96.  Here's an outline of what I did:

  System		Action
- 3.96		Sent a message to 3.95.
- 3.95		Replied to message (Pine asked to include msg in reply)
- 3.96		Replied to reply #1 (Pine asked to include msg & reply to all
				recipients)
- 3.95		Replied to reply #2 (Pine only asked to include msg in reply)
- 3.96		Replied to reply #3 (Pine asked to include msg & reply to all
				recipients)
- *			Repeat ad-nauseum

Looking at the headers, the only thing that I can see different is that the
msg sent from the 3.96 system has a "Return-Path" line.  I manually added
one to the msg sent from 3.95, but it had no effect.

System 3.96 is running Sendmail 8.8.4/8.6.12, and the other Sendmail
8.8.4/8.6.1.

Notice that on the 3.96 system, pine prompts with a "Reply to all
recipients", which I didn't get on the 3.95.  Is this one of the "bug fixes"
indicated in the rel. notes?

Any ideas?

Thanks,

-Brad

this is absolutely the wrong place to email.

hmm. I might try going to a good search engine (http://www.webcrawler.com
or http://www.yahoo.com ) type in 'doom' and see what comes back.

Vinnie (who has never even played doom and therefore knows nothing about
it)

is there a reason you posted the recipe for a malotov cocktail to a
mailing list about pine, a mail user agent?

unless there was a really good reason, please don't do it again.

And it's not even a good one... The good ones have diesel and err...
actually, I was only checking if my sendmail configuration is ok. Hmmm...
Gotta set up Gnus again to mail a complaint to his postmaster.

well, it looked like he was mailing from a school account and complaints
to his postmaster would most likely get him banned from all the computers
in his school, if not kicked out, so I was just going to smack him on the
hand this time. 

I'm too soft head/hearted

Try the Microsoft hotline. They're brilliant technicians with a very
good reputation all over the world. In fact they're about the best
makers of software and hotlines there ever were. Where else do you
want to go today?

I can agree with you Sam.  For your information Robin MS is known to stand for 
Microsoft and I'm using the Works 4.0 application.
One thing you should always remember Robin, is that you should not forget you 
friends on the way up because you will most likely need them on the way down.
Thanks for at least responding I'll not trouble you any longer and I'll share

Hi.  I'm wondering if I can obtain either the source for a base64 to
binary converter, or a definition of how base64 is encoded?

Thanks ...

You will need to download a base64 converter they are commonally available
on most freeware sites.  I had one at one time but I never get that kind
of email so I deleted it.  By the way this is a FAQ might I recommend that
you read it so that you can more quickly have answer any other questions.

That's the way I tried to do it, but the command to go to files takes me 
to directories on a server somewhere, and will not allow me to specify a 
file on my own hard disk.  So I'm stuck!  Would appreciate any other 
suggestions you may have.  By the way, I received a WORD attachment 
perfectly from another system.

How do I upload a file?.  I think the problem is I am not familiar with 
UNIX systems.  The context-sensitive help said that there is no help 
currently available for attachments.

I entirely agree with your views on VSNL.  Hopefully, we'll soon have a 
choice on ISPs in India.  Meanwhile, thanks for your inputs.

>How do I upload a file?

If Z-Modem is available to you, use that. The sending side always invokes it
using "sz" and calling "rz" on the receiving side. You must closely examine the
communications program that you use to see what you have available.

Kermit is also commonly available, but it's more difficult to use.

It sounds like portions of the "help" file are missing. Complain to your system
administrator, and ask him to install the current pine, now at 3.96.

I have also not been able to figure out how to save things on my machine, 
instead of on the remote system (which seems to be the default)?

Hello !!!

When I'm reading mail then I also download mail in the background (cron).
And then i get some errors that mailbox is closed because of write
errors. I know what this means but is there anyway how to overcome this
and not to close your pine every time when pine gets new mail????

Has anyone setup autoresponders with slocal?
Is it good enough to handle several autoresponders per unix account?

hi,
I have a problem with my pine e-mail.  When I am reading my mail, the
control keys at the bottom of the page start mixing with my text.  The
more I press the down arrow key the more the control lists duplicate and
run into my mail.  
thank you for your help

well, I'd love to, but I"m a system administrator.
Now my fiance is a system analyst, which is a little closer to sports
analyst, but still no cigar.

You might try emailing an actual sports analyst, but I don't know where
you would find one.

it sounds like a terminal problem to me

you might try typing (at the prompt, before you go into pine)

$TERM=vt100
$export TERM
$pine

where $ is the prompt

this is all case sensitive

We recently began using pine 3.96 on a linux server for our regional mail. 
 I have compiled group list (all, each office, departments) which our 
located in /etc/aliases.  They work fine but I need to figure out how to 
link these to each users addressbook.  Any suggestions...

true.

though my experience is that most telnet clients default to reasonable
values, but they don't always seem to communicate them well.

but then, mostly I've used crappy MS products, or linux, which normally
behaves.

I am new to the Internet and found out that I need a server(?) in order to be
able to receive updates for my programs I have installed. I am on AOL and from
what I understand they cannot do this. Is my info correct? Please help and
explain what I must do if you can. Thank You! DCKoepp@aol.com

We have no local support to turn to for help, so I hope someone can help
me.  Is there a way to suppress sending the distribution list, in an
outgoing message, so the receiver does not have to read the long list of
names you sent the message to?

Thanks very much.

You need to contact the AOL support hotline. And you need to read
newsgroups like newuser.info and newuser.questions.

Read the User Guide, check for lcc and bcc. That's what you're looking 
for.

I am looking for BinHex 4.0 mail decoding program too. However, all
references that I could find on Internet are for Unix and Mac users
only. So what am I to do if I'm using Windows 95  and just received
an e-mail  that starts with  a line  that looks like that "Must  be
converted through BinHex 4.0". Thank you in advance.

Robin,
Few can dispute the fact that this place is increasingly inhabited by
morons. Your puzzlement is noted, but your exquisite command of the
English language is not called into question.
I think this falls into the category of "RTFPM" (Read the fearsome printer
manual) and also learn the lingua franca of the Internet....ENGLISH!!!
(and I freely confess that it's not an ideal standard) Let's face it,
Gerald is linguistically challenged, and has little interest in the
printed material which was supplied to him (in his own language, no less)
which would cause him to be able to operate his machinery!
Auf Wiedersehn Mein Freund!
-Colin.

Yes. You take a 25 yr old idiot, fill it with bio-gas and put it on
fire. According to recent studies by friends of the enviroment,
bio-gas is not a chemical, because it's natural.

B> if u have, pls let me know cos i'm interested also!

Thank you very much for your valuable input. No, please go back to
Mummy before I have to send you some information about XFree 3, ok?

Dear Amit, 

I'm going to London for a month, which is why I'm in a fairly good
mood... otherwise my answer would have been a bit shorter and would
have contained language unsuitable for children, because your question
is a VFAQ. }:->

The answer to your question is in the Pine FAQ, which can be found on
the Pine website, and should also be on your system. You will find a
pointer to Nancy McGough's filtering mail FAQ, which is a brilliant
document and will answer all your questions. The short answer is "man
procmail", "man procmailex".

Cheers,
Robin

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list are archived.  These archives can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

Please note: the mailing list is no longer mirrored in the comp.mail.pine 
newsgroup.

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Well, paper comes from trees. And trees eat celebrity Alpine skiers.

	I am a new student to Pine. I have a Euroda Pro that I have been
using for awhile. I want to use Eudora for ruch messages until I get
familiar with Pine. I have just discovered that if I retrieve my mail thru
Eudora it erases/deletes my mail in my Pine account. What can I do to
prevent this?   Thanks, calaya

Does anyone have a procmail formula that will allow flags to be set for
pine?  I'd like to flag certain messages as important in pine for mailing
lists.  In my case I'm going to be doing it based on the From address.

[I know this isn't purely a pine question, but it isn't purely a procmail
question either.]

Hmmm, not basicly pine ... have you set 'delete mail on server' in
Eudora. You should disable this or, instead, enable 'leave mail on
server' (or something alike ... don't know the setup-variables). Then,
imo, you should be able to see the mails in pine, even after accessing
them via Eudora.

hth, norbert.

I use Pine 3.95 on an IBM AS??? under AIX and Lynx.

I like the newsreading of Pine MOSTLY, and it competes against Tin, so I
seldom use it for the following reasons:

1) Newsgroups hav no descriptions to the right...not a big plus but.

2) NGs hav no unread messages number beside them.

3) You CAN and Tin does keep track of exactly which messages in which
   groups hav been read in the newsrc file. Within Tin's newsrc file are
   read messages number ranges, like this:

alt.security.pgp: 1-50, 100-120, 500-575

4) When I configure Pine for two newservers, it uses the same newsrc
   file for both, and the servers hav NOT the same newsgroups.

5) Every time I change the newsgroups a message is to be posted in,
   Pine checks them for validity, and takes its time doing it (more time
   than a failed post). Why not just let the post "fail"? It might
   not fail completely: if the NGs don't exist, only that part of the post
   fails. I think that's how Tin works.

6) There's no NG post cancellation feature: You can put the
   "control: cancel" header in yourself, and it's not a one key operation.

will help your disposition at all.  Or, maybe, it is just the prospect
of being let out of where your are now which helps?  :-)

A. get a second email address at your isp or through hotmail or juno or
one of the other places that offer free email.

B. set up a mua to get your mail. if you choose pine, then we can probably
help you with that, if not, then you'll have to find an appropriate place
to ask questions about your mua.

if you mean you want them saved automatically, then listen to what robin
said about procmail 

if you want to save them by hand (ie. read one and then save it to
whichever folder you feel is pertanent) then while reading the message
type <s> <the name of the folder> <enter>

the foldernames are case sensitive

I am sophomore at Tufts University and have recently been experiencing
problems with my e-mail account.  For some reason, next to the word inbox
are the words "READONLY" which are in parentheses.  Also, read messages
are no longer automatically transferred to my saved messages folder when I
exit pine.  Please get back to me as to how I can rectify this situation.

Hmm, READONLY is exactly what we would think of: you have only read
permission on your inbox file. This is why messages aren't
transferred, as I understand it, because this includes, afaik, a
delete operation on the inbox file.

Inbox is set READONLY by pine, if another process is locking the
file. Therefore, look whether another pine process (or any other mua
pointing to the same file) is still running (task manager ...) or
check lock files that might have been left because of an unwanted
(:-)) exit from pine.

And then, I don't know much about WinNT and it's early in the morning,
ie my answer might be a complete mess.

l8er, norbert.

How do I auto forward messages to another email address using Pine?

And, can I write a message that all senders will receive that informs them
I'm temporarily unable to access my GWIS2 account?

Sincerely,
D.O. Fuller

My display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set. When I receive email
in the "ISO-8859-1" character set some of the characters are displayed
incorrectly. Is there a way I can set my display to read both sets of
characters correctly?
Thank you for any suggestions
Arlene

Subject: Typos in E-mail text.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Can you please help me in my quest for answers ? All of my E-mail has what
looks like typos scattered though out each message, sometimes a couple of
words will be repeated.
I have yet to find anyone including the servers people who can explain
what is wrong.
I am using MS DOS and Pine 3.95, no problems with reception and the DOS
does fine, I have WINDOWS 3.11 but as yet have not mastered any of this so
I stay with DOS until I can find someone to help me with it.
The phone company tells me that the line from the central office is clean
so I am not sure what the next move is.
Thankyou for any advice you can give to resolve this problem.
No one else has this typo problem. Computer illiterate, yes I admit it.
Best Regards, fae@diamond.sunset.net

Turn off local echo in your terminal emulation. The only characters you want to
see on your console are those sent back from the computer you've logged on to.
If you echo those characters locally, you see them twice.

Afaik, you can't do it in pine but you may put a file called
'.forward' into your home directory with your new address as content:

echo "new-name@new-domain" > $HOME/.forward

 DOF> And, can I write a message that all senders will receive that

Not with pine again. Try 'man vacation' and use it, if it's available
or get a copy of it from the net.

This is, what I've found in the tech-notes:

character-set
         This sets the character set used by the terminal. Currently
     appropriate values are US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-9 and
     ISO-2022-JP. See the section on international character sets for more
     details. The default is US-ASCII.

Since US-ASCII is a subset of ISO-88590-1 (is it?), you should have no
troubles in setting the variable 

s(etup) c(onfig) ctrl-w(here-is) "character-set" enter 
[?(help) ... enjoy ... e(xit)]
c(hange) "ISO-8895-1" enter e(xit) y(es)

Provided your terminal is able to display the character set, you're
done.  

hth, norbert.

All,

I know this cannot be a new question, but I couldn't find it in the FAQ,
manpages, tech-notes or mailing list archive.  Here is my situation.

I have an account on a POP3 server, mailserv.nbnet.nb.ca.  The account name
is fade.  I'm trying to read my mail on my LINUX box locally and I want to
use Pine to do it.  The account I almost always log on as root to my
machine
(which has no domain name and no static IP, damned ppp connection.)

First off, can I do this?  On the assumption that I can, here is what I
have
tried.

I downloaded a POP3 client called getpop3.  All it does is open a
connection
to the server, sends it the username, password and the dynamic IP I have
been
assigned.  The server creates an SMTP connection (port 25) and sends the
mail.  Everything is fine that way.  I can read my mail okay.

Now, when I choose to reply (or send new mail) I can compose it and send it
without a hitch, but the message that the recipient gets is 'From'
root@nbnet.nb.ca, not fade@nbnet.nb.ca.  This is kind of interesting from
a security point of view, but pretty annoying for just simple
correspondance.

The only solutions I have come up with are:

1) Create an account 'fade' on my local machine for the purpose of reading
email.  This is what I've done and if that is the best I can do I'll live
with it.

2) Recompile Pine to allow setting the "From: " line in the custom headers.
I tried this last night and ran into a bigger can of worms.  While
compiling
mailindx.c the compiler received signal 6, internal compiler error it said.
If it helps, I'm using gcc 2.7.2.2 with libc 5.4.33.  Oh, and the Pine I'm
compiling is 3.96.

Personally, I'm hoping that there is some magical third option I haven't
seen.  Anybody have any suggestions?

Thanks.

Joe M.

Is there anyway to unlock folders from being read only? Our server crashed
over the weekend and ever since we got it up and running again, all my
folders in pine say they are read only. How can I get them back to normal?

Not sure it's the best way, but you should be able to use the string of 
commands ";" "a" "a" "s" etc to save all messages in a read only folder to
another folder which will be a read and write folder. YOu may then delete
the original folder and then rename the new folder to the old name if you
wish. This worked for me in PC-Pine - I assume it will work in a Unix
Pine. 

Or a really hard way (it's been a long time and I don't really remember
correctly perhaps) is to open the folder file from outside Pine with Pico
or some other editor like vi and (globally) change the "Status:" argument
of EACH message to contain nothing (it will typically read "Status:RO").

Are there other ways (anybody)?

Recently, one of my friends attempted to e-mail me a very large message
with a program for me to down-load.  This never came through.  Is there a
limit as to how large a message can be received?

Yes, there is a limit, but it will vary depending on the path the mail
takes on its way from your friend to you.  Each mail transport agent (MTA)
along the path can impose a size limit per mail message processed. If the
mail from your friend is larger than that limit for any MTA in the path,
that MTA will reject the message.

I have experimented with the addressbook (.adr) size, and found out that 
at about the 1,100 address level, it won't take anymore.  I don't think 
it counts the exact number of addresses, but I think it does count the 
number of bytes in the header or the BCC.  Any comments?

Do a "killall pine" or kill the multiple sessions you're obviously running
by saying 
ps ax | grep pine and then kill -9 the PID.

[how to set from header]

The answer is a) to recompile or b) to use qmail which will take care of
the forging part. qmail's a pretty smart program, anyway.

Cheers,
Robin

P.S. I thought pine was kinda hard to use, but MS internet mail is probably
the crappiest, dumbest and most inconvenient program I've ever used. :-(

Oh yeah, sure - and these morons around want to put me in front of an

Hmmm.  Okay.  I'm also looking into the sendmail end of things, to see if
I can correct the problem after Pine sends it but before it leaves the
machine.

Anyway, any guesses on what may be causing my re-compile problem?  I don't
mind going in and making some changes if I have to, but I don't want to
start
blidly groping through code I've never looked at before.  The only error
message I get is "cc internal compiler error" and "received signal 6".  Is
this a known problem with either my libc or gcc verions?  (5.4.33 and
2.7.2.2
respectively.)

I'll also take a look at qmail.  Personally my mailer of choice was emacs
at work until someone decided that Lotus Notes for Solaris looked pretty
neat.  *ack hack hack*  Tragically this person seemed to be a policy
maker.

Believe me, you have my sincerest sympathies.  :)

We have a global addressbook with 10753 addresses in it, and growing.  We
rebuild it from scratch with a cron job, so there's no cruft left over
from earlier incarnations.  How are you building yours?

Dear Pine,
I have over 380 e-mails in my inbox and I have tried to delete some of
them-They refuse to be deleted.  How can I get my e-mails to be deleted?

Unable to delete,
Liz

The host from which you can download PC-Pine is an Anonymous FTP server,
not a WWW server -- try:

ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine/pcp_w32.zip

Oh, ye seeker of deeper wisdom, hear my words and ye shall reap the
blessed knowledge of the ages.  Abuse not this wondrous gift from the
heavens, but praise the stars, and be humble before your brother, for we

Thank not, simply be.  And remember, the notion of self is the cure for

>anyone knows how to entirely turn off composer wrapping in pine?

You can't. The maximum word wrap is 80 characters.

If you must send long lines in the body of the message, you'll have to compose
a text file and read it into the body of the message with ^r.

Use the "-w" switch to turn off word wrap in pico. This will simply break lines
after the 255th character. And, justifying will truncate the line if there are
no space characters to break up the word to less than 255 characters.

Enable "aggregate-commands" in the setup and read the documentation.

Also, maybe the original poster didn't read about the eXpunge command?

Hi,

Could you provide me with some information on how to use Unix to search
for news such as "can.jobs".

Any information is highly appreciated.

While composing a message, put the cursor in the headers and hit ^j and enter
the filename. It's that simple. You are, of course, positive, that the
receipient can read Word, right?

With respect to "unharmed", there's nothing pine can do about that. pine
doesn't handle mail transport. Each of the machines along the path to the final
machine must be properly configured to handle MIME attachments. All you can do
is hope for the best.

Hello ,
     I've subscribed to this list for about 2 months now and I have
learned quite a bit from it and am grateful for your technical
expertise.
     I would, however, like to voice a pet peeve.
     When you include the original message in your posts, would you
please put it after your message?  I am blind and use speech for
access and having the quote first is time consuming and a bit
annoying.
     If I am reading your post, I am usually familiar with the
thread and can silence my machine and go on to another post.
     I realize this takes some extra work, but it would help insure
your posts are read and make the time on the Internet more
productive for those of us using access devices.
     Thank you,
     Margaret

Thanks, Margaret, for a point of view it wouldn't have occurred
to me to think of.  It's a kind of rock-and-hard-place thing from
my perspective - for myself, I prefer to have quotes first rather
than last because (and especially if there's a timelapse between
the original post and the reply) it's easier to pick up on the
discussion thread when the stream is chronological -
quote/reply/quote/reply...It hadn't occurred to me that that
might be a problem for some.  I wonder if there's a solution that
would suit everyone, at least to some extent....I'll have to give
that some thought.

And my question was................I have a client who wants to
save mail to folders, sans header.  Doesn't want anything except
maybe date and sender.  Is it possible to do that?  Anyone have
an idea how?  

Please let me know...

Marianne

Sure... Do a websearch for a script called printmail (which is part of elm
IIRC). That will do exactlz what that person's looking for...

Hmmm... I'm starting to like that verz funnz spelling thing here...

You could always set a filter up that discards any line beginning with a
greater than sign. The greater than sign is, of course, the standard
"This line is quoted" symbol. Perhaps you have a friend that can help with
such a project?

I am not a member of the mailing list.  I came across various references
to this in a search for pico.  

I have recently signed up with a new ISP.  I was happy to know that they
did offer a shell acount.  But when I logged into my shell I found that
they had next to no programs there for use.  

I have been given the go ahead to install some programs for them.  I
have located elm, and will be istalling that over the weekend.  I know
that it needs to be linked to a text editor.  Since all they have is vi
(yuck!) I need to install pico.  Not just for elm do we need pico, just
for ease of editing in general.

Where may I find pico and instructions for installation?

please reply to me directly, as I am not a member of this list.

Thank You
Matt Kelly

ftp ftp.cac.washington.edu

Obtain the pine 3.96 tar, with a choice of gz or Z compression, from the pine
directory. You'll find the pico editor in the pine tar.

Hi,Robin:

I really appreciate your information. Through the 'dejanews', I really can
find a lot of jobs. But I can not find what I want. I want to find a job
in Canada in life sciences. Could you give me more guidance? How can I
reach newsgroup: can.jobs specifically?

Thanks again for your help.

I downloaded the compressed binary pine 3.96 files to my PC then
transferred the pine file to diskette and the used dosread (without the 
-a parameter) on a RS/6000 to transfer the binary file to the RS/6000. I 
then used the uncompress command to uncompress the file. There is 
something else I need to do with this file to get PINE to work on the
RS/6000 but I haven't figured that out. Any ideas or helpful 
suggestions? If this is a binary file do I need to download the 
"makefile" you reference in your README documentation? HELP!
Thanks in advance for your suggestions!
Brian

You have been told repeatedly that the pine-info mailing list is for discussion
of the pine executable, a user agent for Internet mail. You cannot ask for
information on seeking jobs in Canada through this mailing list! You didn't
send your reply to Robin, but to the list.

If your system administrator has set up pine for news reading, yes, you can
read can.jobs. Look at the folder list ("l" from the main menu) and hit "?" for
help. Read about folder collections as you need to create a news collection.

Then, go to your configuration file (s, then c, from the main menu) and read
the help "?" for folder collections and news collections. You must be able to
read news via NNTP or IMAP. If you need further help, ask your system
administrator. We can't tell you what your news server is!

Everything is OK....except for your last statement.  One of the goals of 
MIME was to make it such that no MTA in the middle need to know anything
about MIME.  So, there is no requirement that any MTA be configured in any
way to handle MIME attachments.

Is there a recommended way to have pine access sent-mail-???-?? folders
that have been gzip'd? Or, is there any intention to add that feature to
pine? Thanks in advance and of course...... thanks for pine!!

I am simply using PINE's "Take Address" function.  After a certain size, 
it (pine 3.91) won't take any more.  I have, however, copied very large 
address lists from a file into the message body, and then moved them into 
the BCC, and this worked fine.  So maybe the problem is that this pine 
can mail large numbers but it just can't take that many using its own 
function.

My last statement was, "Hope for the best."

We have had quite a bit of discussion about machines truncating and rewriting
headers, or choosing to pass only certain headers. I suggest that such machines
are not properly configured to handle MIME attachments. If any such machines
are along the path that mail travels from sender to receipient, the attachment
won't be unharmed. The headers must survive transport!

Otherwise, it ain't MIME; it's garbage.

I wanted to know if there was a way to copy text from Pine and paste it
in a text editor and save it as a text file automatically on a Win95
platform. When I say automatically, i mean there is no user interaction,
only a program which copies and pastes automatically at given time
intervals. 

any info would be appreciated, thank you.

Several times in email msgs I have received the following:

Where does this message come from?  Is it automatically

"Automatically" "No user intervention"?? The answer is no as you ask it.
You miss out many details of exactly what you are working with, but let's
make a few assumptions.
Presumably, you have telnetted into an account from a Win95 machine, and
have invoked Pine remotely to read your mail (it would have helped if you
had told us how you were doing this but it seems like maybe this is how
you're doing it)
Just highlight, copy, and paste whatever text is of interest into Notepad
from your telnet client screen. (bundled client with Win95 or some client
like NetTerm).
Maybe I'm missing something here, but that's how I read this.

Is there anywhere I can find an accurate list of MIME supported file

could send an answer directly to the email address: daved@belmay.com.
Thanks in advance.

That's always the case within the Internet.  :-) :-)

Correct.  However, these MTAs are simply *broken*.  Their choice to mangle
headers has nothing to do with the headers being MIME or not.  Chances
are very good that the MTAs in question predate MIME.

Yep....

It is created by pine when the "charset" parameter in the MIME headers do
not match what is set for your system.

Yes, it is an informative message only.

You don't.

To whom it may concern,
	I was wondering how to make a picture appear on my pc when my
brother scans a picture and sends it. When I get the e-mail I can read the
message but the system will not allow me to view the attached picture
that has been scanned and sent. If you could please tell me what I am
doing wrong or if it can be done it would be appreciated. Thank you for
your time.


						Sincerely,
						Kevin Mcgrogan

You seem to be running pine under Solaris.  This mean you must be using
some sort of telnet session to your Sun box to run pine.  If this is the
case then the data file (picture) resides on the Sun box...but the
application to render the picture is on your PC.  So, one method, is to 
save the picture to the disk on the Sun and then transfer it to the PC
and run the application to render it.  

Without knowing your HW/SW setup it is difficult to advise an exact method
to accomplish the task.  Maybe your "helpdesk" could be of assistance?
