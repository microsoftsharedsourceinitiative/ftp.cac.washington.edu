X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list are archived.  These archives can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:

       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Hello Listers,
     Thank you for your willingness to consider my peeve and for
trying to come up with a solution that fits everyone's needs.
     The suggestion to filter out all lines beginning with a ">" 
is a good one
and I will definitely look into it.
     Thanks for listening,
     Margaret

Ask your GSM service provider.  

Of course you are not in Singapore....but Singtel has a Web page for
sending SMS to its subscribers' GSM.

 I heard him on tody9sunday feb4th0
and now I know why I have always
feared physicoligists. Dr.Fisk and
Dr.Herrick have diagnosed our
Presiden without ever meeting him.
   With this kind  of freedom for 
anybody to be able to get on 
national t.v. and espouse the
nonsense they did, I think it is
about time to change the first
amendent so that this sort of
horror would not be allowed.
   I lso want to mention that the
supreme court yelled fire  in a
crowded theater when the allowd
a civil suit(that could have been
delayed so as not to deter our
President from the work of our
country) go forward. They decided
it would not interfer boy were the
off base.  
    I have been around for a very 
long ime (too long) and have never
seen such hatred and meaness
in the government as I see now.
      HOW CAN WE SLOW ALL
THIS DOWN AND START TO
SHOW SOME DECOREM SO
THAT OUR CHILDREN WOULD
NOT GROW UP I THIS KIND 
OF ATMOSPHER?
   Please do think about all this.

Hi,

I'm new to the Pine system and wonder if anyone knows how to jump around
in text that I've written to insert something or erase something without
having to erase a bunch of stuff to get there???

Thanks a million!

Darren

Dear Pine,
    I have a question about how to do something with my e-mail address.

I would like to know how to set-up my pine e-mail so that it forwards
any new messages to another e-mail address so that I don't have to 
write everyone and tell them of my new location.

Thank you.
Sincerely,
Kirk Smith

To whom it may concern,
	I would like to know what I need to change in the configuration of
the pine program, so I could recieve a picture in which my brother has
scanned for me. Right know when I hit the "V" button to view attachment it
does not allow me to see the picture. If you could please provide me with
this information I would be very grateful. Thank you.

Did my last response not get to you?

You are running pine on Solaris.  Please tell us about your HW and SW that
you are using to access the Solaris box.  If you are using X-Windows then
there is hope.  If you are not using X-Windows....or you don't know what
X-Windows is then the road will be rocky.

Regards,
Ed

No, it's AOL, aka "Internet fuer Aale" in Germany. Damn, I cannot get pine

Why is this message so mysterious to so many?

You may have had a core dump into your home directory upon losing your session.
Look for a binary file (you can't read it with a pager) called "core". Delete
it, and it should free up disk space.

Get yourself a book that discusses commonly used Unix commands, and learn them.
The "quota" command will tell you what your quota is. "du" tells you your
current usage. "man [command]" will give extensive help with any command. Don't
know the correct command? Type "apropos [keyword]" which searches man pages for
the keyword you listed. "ls" lists your file names.

To look for files that resulted from core dumps, try "ls -alF". You may have to
pipe it to a pager for easier reading: ls -alF|more

-a lists hidden files, -l gives a long listing with byte count, and -F puts a
slash after directory names and an asterisk after executables.

Dear Forum

	I find a lot of files in my directory that are apparently temp
files but I am not sure. They are generally named as pinerc027531 or some
such name. Most of them are of zero file size but some are larger. Can
these files be deleted without affecting pine.

Yes. After changing your .pinerc, pine isn't exiting properly and deleting the
temporary files. Does this happen at every session or only occassionally? If
only occassionally, don't worry about it.

But, if it happens with every session, increase your debug level and discuss it
with your system administrator.

To be safe, you can attempt to read the temporary files with a pager.

Hello,
	Please E-mail me privately as I am not on this list. I am using
pine 3.96 at my school, running it on a Unix system. Can I filter
messages out, or even better, bounce them? I am getting messages from
people I don't want to receive them from. Can I bounce them back, or
filter them out without ever seeing them? Please E-mail privately. Thank
you.
Dave.

Please tell us how to get back to finish composing an e-mail when our
service was disconnected. I did not have enough time to postpone or send
the e-mail and I am guessing it is now lost. I reconnected, but could not
find my e-mail. Thanks, Nancy  astriggo@monroe.lib.mi.us

Hello, 

My e-mail account locked on me and I am no longer able to receive e-mail.
I need help immediately since I highly depend on e-mail for everything.
Please send me a message with instructions on how to fix this at
mgruiz@leland.stanford.edu (my friend's e-mail). Again, the error message
claims that I have a lock and cannot receive e-mail. 

Thanks, 

Erika Ornelas

<sigh>
I hate to do this, but...

We're running Pine 3.96 on four HP servers (HPUX 10.20), and most users
are happy.  There are a couple of annoying mysteries, though, the most
recent of which has me looking here for help.

On three of our servers, pine.conf is read successfully, and users get the
default values if there's nothing in their .pinerc files.  So far, so
good.  All except our largest host, which seems to read all values in
pine.conf *except* those for mailcap-search-path and mimetype-search-path.

Why would this happen?  Or, more to the point, Why Not?  There's no
MAILCAPS variable set on any of these machines (I'd like to skip any
discussion of why, if that's okay), and I can't find anything else that
might affect this.  The binaries we're using are identical (I even made a
copy of a "working" pine to the affected host, but it made no difference). 

Oh yeah.  I searched the pine-info archives, and found nada.

Anyone have any ideas?

what do you mean by stop? Not opening pine stops incoming mail
altogether - in a sense.

Or is it something like 'vacation', what you are looking for (man
vacation)?

l8er, norbert - guessing.

Pine,

I am having problems getting my new printer to print in pine and tycho.
I called HP about the 820Cse and I did as they informed me to go to the
properties and access the MS-DOS files, but the printer does not work.
Then I tried to use the Pine setup and to change the print settings with
no help. Do you have any advice? I'm becoming FRUSTRATED.

Ciao,

Aaron

I am baffled by a recurring problem:  when I receive my E-mail messages,
there is always a line of type stuck in where it doesn't belong and
frequently a piece of the message is missing.  If I print it, it prints
properly.  I can use help with this.

Secondly, I am new to PINE, and I am more familiar with what I have at
home--Eudora, but I cannot scroll down to read an entire document without
printing it because I cannot locate a key labelled "Spc."  (I thought it
might be the backspace key, but the command response tells me that it is
not accurate.)  Please advise.  Thanks

To Whom It may Concern,
	When I used by email, I always encounter the sentence 
error saving configuration in file "/stul/home/mlop6922/.pinerc": Disk
quota exceeded, at my main file. And while writing this document in the
bottome of this screen it states error closing.  I don't understand how to
fix this problem.  Right now, when I send messages, it says it fails to
send butlater it indicates to me, that the message is sent.  But I don't
understand why it doesn't save or list the people I sent the mail to in my
folder called sent-mail-jan-1998.


PS what should I do?

Concerned,
Student

Hi, I am e-mailing you to tell you about a problem I encounter using pine.
In almost every e-mail that I receive, several sentences are repeated.
I'll read a sentence and then right below it, the same sentence or words
are written.  I also encounter several spelling errors. 
Could you tell me why this is happening and if there is anything I can do
about it?  Thanks
Sincerely
	Cris Burkett

Ah, someone else from Chicago.

Your TERM and communications program emulation don't match, and you aren't
seeing proper screen rewrites. Karl uses Linux, as I recall.

In your .bash_profile

TERM=vt102; export TERM

The export command might be on its own line with a list of other environment
variables, which is also acceptable.

Make sure your comm program is set to emulate vt102 as well. (If only vt100 is
available to you, choose that and set TERM=vt100 instead.)

You normally use threats to unsubscribe from mailing lists? Well, that could
work if the list owner is paying attention. Or, it could get your account
cancelled, if the list owner has a word with your system administrator.

Turn off "local echo" in your comm program. You are sending keystrokes directly
to your own terminal emulation, as well as seeing them from the remote
computer. You only want to see them from the remote side.

>I also encounter several spelling errors.

That you will have to discuss with your correspondents.

How 'bout setting up a Web site and having them enter their credit card

Thank you for your help, but where is my comm program.  How do I turn off
"local echo"?  I can't seem to find it.  Thanks
Cristian

Hello everyone,

imho some easily recognizable public presence
might not be amiss in this world,
for Pine either.

The other day I read an e-mail client survey.
Pine was not among them at all.
This was attributed to the "X-Mailer:"field
that had exclusively been evaluated.
[no further comment...]
Pine headers, on the other hand
only use "Message-Id:" as a means of client identification.

So, please allow me to suggest 
	"X-Mailer:" to be used by default 
in future versions as well.

Kind regards,
hal :-)

First lesson for today: RTFM. The answer is in the FAQ which can be
obtained from the pine website. Happy reading,

It sounds like a good idea, however, the makers of Pegasus mail recently
REMOVED their X-Mailer header from future releases. It seems that spammers
were using it too frequently, *violating the user agreement,* and getting
the program banned by overzealous spam blockers. So the X-Mailer header
hurt them, and they removed it.
So there's two sides to every story...

Your communications program is on your local machine. It's what you use to
interact with your modem.

my question is how many spammers could handle pine...

Considering that one of my better tools against them is Winnuke..and they

wouldn't you think something was wrong :)  )

You *don't* want to talk to us!!!!!

You want to talk to the people responsible for setting up your email
account.  Those would be the nice folks at bridgeport.edu....

Send an email to "postmaster@cse.bridgeport.edu" and maybe you will get
service.

Yes it is... Its purpose is for people like you to keep sending it around
the net... *argl* The only way to stop it is a small amount of lead applied
to the original poster's head, preferably with a P1 for style's sake.

Have a nice weekend,

this isn't really the place to ask. This is a mailing list about an email
program. But a good place to start would probably be

http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/United_States/Education/Colleges_and_Universities/

Hi!

How can I put together a mailing list of 20-30 of my closest

one by one?

Shawn

	I have a question about your set up,  or access to previous mail
sent.   How do I get to read my mail that was sent previously.  Is it
stored somewhere,  or is it lost in space when I send it.  Please help.

	A second question is in the area of printing.  Could you give me
an idea what to do to get messages sent by e-mail printed.  I have a
Cannon BJ-200e printer,  that is configured with the computer,  and will
print off the internet,  but it will not print mail from Pine.  Please
help
or suggest if you can.

Thanks in advance

almst65+@pitt.edu.

_How can I put together a mailing list of 20-30 of my closest
_friends so that I don't have to enter each one's name
_one by one?
Q: What is a mailing list ? 
A: pine-info is a mailing list. 

Probably, you do not want to establish that sort of a mailing list, 
the address of which can be used by others in the internet 
as a distribution address (to all your personal friends).
If so, cf. appendix.

Instead, you probably want to establish something in 
your address book, something like a 'group address'.
Choosing this group address,
Pine would distribute your mail to your friends.
The group's nickname is NOT an email address.
A group address in your addressbook
is only accessible to you.


a. Establishing a group address:

m ain menue
a ddressbook
a ddnew			(i.e. new menu opens)
			
(nickname, short single string of letters) <enter>
(full name, e.g. my friends) <enter>
<enter>
<enter>
(1st friend's address) ,
(2nd friend's address) ,
(3rd friend's address) ,          
	et cetera.....
(last friend's address, hopefully not really your last friend's one) 
^X			(i.e. eXit/save the address book)
m ain menu

You may ease establishing the 'group address'
by referring to single addresses that you've previously entered.
While in the 'addnew' menu / address field
just take a hop the single address list with ^t
and select the address you would like 
to introduce to your 'group address'

b. using a group address:

When composing, 
write the group's *nickname* into To: or Cc:
and <enter>
Immediately the group unfolds.

If you do not remember the group's nickname  
you may scroll the addressbook by ^t
Choose the group address by <enter>

By default, all your friends will find
all your other friends' addresses in their From: 

Instead, you may use the 'rich header' when composing: ^r
Enter your own address in the To:
and the group's nickname into Lcc:
Thus, everyone will get the mail
only with his own address.

Kind regards, hal :-)
----------------------------------------------------------
                                               bork@plb.de

N.B.
A single address can be transferred directly
from incoming mail to the address book 
without retyping it.
When reading the mail, enter ^t 
(i.e. 'take').

P.S.
Simple mailing lists accessible to everyone by an alias mail address 
may be established, if you have a Unix machine (e.g.Linux) 
at your full disposal, and e.g. sendmail as your mail server.
For more information type at the system prompt  
	man newaliases

Hello Florence;
This message is sent to you using Pine 3.96 running on an RS6000 with AIX
4.2.1.
Pine wil run on (as far as I know) any flavor of Unix. Unix can run on
(almost) any hardware platform made in recent years, that's one of it's
strengths!
I hope this helps.
Regards, 
-Colin

pine should create a 'sent-mail' file.  on a monthly basis it will ask you if
you would like to move the previous mail in sent-mail to a folder named for the
previous month. if you choose yes it creates that folder and moves all the sent
mail to it so you can keep it organized chronologically,  if you choose no i
believe it purges all the old sent-mail but this i'm not completely sure on.

I'm using Pine 3.95 under Lynx on AIX on an AS/400.

I sent a message to this list a while ago and received no reply. The help
I hav doesn't mention how to subscribe to this list, just how to send
messages to it, so if this message won't do the trick, will someone
directly address me with the subscription routine.

Is set-forward a c-shell thing? I've never heard of it.

.forward is an alias file in your home directory that directs sendmail to
redirect your incoming mail elsewhere. It's nothing to do with pine.

If sendmail is your system's Mail Transport Agent, then "man aliases" for a
description of the file format and everything you need to know about aliasing.

Dear support staff,

I'm going to be out of town for a while. How can I get all my mail 
forwarded to my current e-address overseas?

Thanks a lot,
Regards,
Alexei Rybkin

You may wish to use the program "vacation", which is usually located in
/usr/bin/vacation.  More specific questions should go to your local
support staff and or network administrator.

I received a message on my e-mail that I am "experiencing a bug."  I had
difficulty logging on. When I typed in my logon ID, it was as  what I was
typing was not registering. Lettert appeared on the screen that I did not
type. I am also having trouble typing this message. Below I will type,
"The cow jumped over the moon" without editing and you will see what I
mean.

"The cow jued over the mopn"
What can I do to fix this?

Normally, old messages are stored in a folder 'sent-mail' (default

Hmm, have you had a look into your printer setup? There is a paragraph 
dealing with a standard UNIX print command as well as a personally
selected print command. you might use the latter, if your setup is a
bit strange, or the standard, if it covers your likings.

hth, norbert.

I don't know much about the vacation programme. The simplest way, imo, 
is to put a file called '.forward' into your home directory pointing
to your current address.

echo 'my-brand-new-address' > $HOME/.forward

That should do the trick. Don't forget to remove the file afterwards.

I see a lot of this in here. This would explain why there are so many
questions about 'disk quota exceeded'.  Is there nothing in the FAQ or
at the web site on this, or is it just like everything else...they're
not reading it? 

Well, I just looked it up...here's one place to find out about the
sent-mail folder:

Seems the site's just too handy for me tonight.  ;-)  Here's the
scoop:

As of version 3.96, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
Protocol)  server. Like Unix Pine, PC-Pine 4.00 will be able to access
a POP server in "online" mode. That is, Pine will start a POP3 session
and keep it open until the mailbox is closed. Due to the nature of the
POP3 protocol, Pine will not see any new mail which arrives during the
POP3 session.

Ok, First upgrade to the "pine-3.96-7.i386.rpm" update from 
ftp.redhat.com. Then set this in your Pine config.

display-filters = _LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP")_ /usr/local/bin/pgpv -f
sending-filters = /usr/local/bin/pgps -aft
                  /usr/local/bin/pgpe -afst -r _RECIPIENTS_

That's it. No need for any external filters.
As always you can add the -z switch with your password if you don't want
to enter it all the time. Example for "sign":

/usr/local/bin/pgps -aft -z VerySecret

"VerySecret" is your PGP password.
When you want to send using your two new filters you press Ctrl-N when
Pine ask "Send message (unfilterd)?" to select the other two.
(If no other filters exist when you press Ctrl-N the most common problem
is that you specified the wrong path to the executable)

Good luck. And put this in some FAQ please.

I've got a quick question.  How do I instruct pine to
return a canned message to all incoming email senders
while I'm away from the office?  I tried putting a
.vacation file in my directory but that didn't seem to do
it.

Hmm, perhaps you should have a chat with your system administrator in

Hello!

I am interested in filtering incomming e-mails.
I mean, is it possible to refuse letters from a special person?
Thank you!

Hmm, normally users tend to use procmail for tasks like
this. According to some postings here (where they shouldn't be :-)
procmail is *not* difficult to configure :-))

Try 'man procmail' ... on a UN*X system, that is :-)

l8er, norbert.

When I logged in this evening (you could check the exact time for
yourself, if you want to) I was shocked to say the least to find
all the messages in the "inbox" had been "cleaned-out" or deleted,
or other wise somehow got rid of without my knowledge or permission.
How do I get this lot back.A lot of it is personal stuff friends.
I ask you "get them back for me" and you will get my thanks unreservedly.

I have set up PC-Pine for our system via IMAP and have a good amount of
experience with the UNIX version running of Solaris 2.51.  We have created
individual pinerc files for each user that are identical with the
exception of the "username=" line yet some individuals INBOX's are being
moved to $HOME/mbox.  Having been made aware of the problem I proceeded to
do a diff on each of the users pinerc files with my own (which works fine)
and the only difference indeed in the "username=" line.  Is there
some behavior of PC-Pine that would make it do this or should I proceed
to investigate user error as the cause for these problems.  This only
seems to happen to a small number of the 4000 users we have currently
using this program.  For those interested assisting with this problem I
have attached a copy of our default pinerc file.

Thanks,
Chris.

Note:  The users home directories are mounted via samba as M:\.

# Pine configuration file -- customize as needed.
#
# This file sets the configuration options used by Pine and PC-Pine.  If you
# are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide configuration
# file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments in
# this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about
# specific settings see the section on configuration options in the Pine
# notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.
# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated
# by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a
# continuation of the previous line.  For a variable to be unset its value
# must be blank.  To set a variable to the empty string its value should
# be "".  You can override system defaults by setting a variable to the
# empty string.  Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and
# default to "no".
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Pine.

You have sent your message to *thousands* of people all over the world.
The address you used is a discussion group about the mail user agent known
as "pine".  

You need to talk with your "friendly" system administrator at VSNL.

When you signed up for email services at VSNL, didn't they give you and
email address for their helpdesk?  Or, a number to call?

Good luck!!!!!  (I've dealt with VSNL...and you are going to need it.)

Regards,
Ed

why not filtering with a .forward and filter-rules???   Procmail is not
"standard" Unix, is it???  I ask because my system in SCD does not have a
"procmail" executable, yet CGD (my old division) does.  I was also told
that users in CGD were the ones to install procmail there.  So,... I would
assume that procmail may not always be available.

I use elm filtering here.  Of course, your systems folks could disable
that as well (that is the case in CGD), but if not, check out the
information at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~walker/elm-filter.html#ref

I think this info is pretty good.

Good luck

Lana

Hi,
I have a question in regards to attached files.  I have not been able to
send or receive attached files without problems.  At work I use Eudora
Lignt, and I have no problems sending or receiving attached files.  I am
wondering why do these problems occur.  Everyone that I know (who uses
pine)has the same problem.  Thanks for your time....>Matthew Smith

Hi,

could you please tell us exactly what your problems with attached
files and pine are that you share with so much a user and that you
don't experience with Eudora?

Yer such a trouble maker. I am content to wallow in ignorance of problems of

Hi Adam,

you are absolutely right, but since I've read the message ... why
doesn't pine (or any other MUA) provide the possibility to extract
vital information (or the lack of it :-) from a message without having 
to read it first - damn ... hello mr moderator (I s'pose that's the
cue for Colin :-)

Cheers, Norbert.

That's a feature promised in 4.0. However, I think the composer should extract
vital information from the sender's brain and put it into the message before
sending, or at least check it for content and pull his chair out from under him
before he can hit ^x.

	Uhhhh (staggering back from the Vomitorium and weakly resuming sitting
position in front of terminal) I just love a pound of chili tipped into a
bag of nachos and eaten by tipping the bag at an angle of 45*, then
inhaling what gravity delivers.  
	4.0 should contain a newbie monitor, which when invoked,(when the
user asks a non-Pine question via this list) causes the user to receive a
brain freezing death ray from the terminal screen. Also, on the subject of
newbies, can't we market a lotion/potion via the U/Wash website that
implants the FAQ into the new user's mind?

Well <laugh> I'll respectfully pass the torch to a list member<chuckle>
who has some insight <muffled hoot> on what features 4.0 <giggle> may
incorporate.
Your post may go down in history, I thought I was pretty damn addicted to
email, but I guess I'm <snort, guffaw> really not that addicted after all!

	Pine is a mail reader, and therefore cannot access www pages.
Usually however, there is a browser acessible from many shell accounts.
Bale out of Pine, and at the command prompt just type "lynx" (without
parentheses)  which should invoke the browser if installed. The interface
is going to look very different if you are accustomed to a graphically
based browser, like Netscape, but one great benefit of lynx is that it's
blazingly fast because it doesn't have all that graphical content to
load.(It's also running over your ISP's presumably fast connection to the
Internet.
	When lynx opens, hit "G" (Go) and the URL (http://www.whatever.com) to visit the www
page you are looking for. Go haead and play with lynx for a while, you'll
find out it's well worth the time, and you may find the speed quite
compelling.

First, check your configuration (that is setup/config). Close to the
beginning it tells you about the folder names you are currently using
(defaults are 'read-msgs' and 'sent-msgs', respectively).

Then have a look in your mail folder directory in which you should be
able to see those files).

Chris,
The place to look is in the users' home directory.  If there is an
mbox file, imapd will automatically move mail from the spool directory
into it.  You can recompile imapd without the mbox driver to avoid this,
or you can seek out and rename all of the mbox files you find in home
dirs. In the next release, we may make the mbox driver optional rather
than one of the default drivers to avoid this problem.

There is no Internet protocol, and pine has no proprietary way of doing it.

Short of a phone call or a reply to your message, no.

But, this confuses me. Pine does not require that embedded "<nl><nl>From " in
the message body be escaped!

>From technotes.txt:

Berkeley Mail Format

Some mail programs will interpret any line beginning with "From " as a message
separator, while others --including Pine-- will not be confused unless the line
really looks like a message separator, complete with address and date. Such
lines will be modified to begin with ">From ".

Now, I've never been able to fool Pine into seeing a message boundary unless I
actually add a line that exactly resembles an acceptable "Berkeley" boundary. A
simple "From " following a blank line doesn't do it.

The only thing that's ever confused Pine about the boundary is when someone has
read an e-mail message into another message, preserving the boundary.

Mr. Berens kindly explained the problem to me.

Unlike other MUAs, Pine is generally NOT fooled by embedded "<nl><nl>From " as
it recognizes 20 "Berkeley" boundary formats, according to the technical notes.

Solaris relies upon an added Content-Length header, ignoring embedded
"Berkeley" boundaries prior to the expected end of the message.

But, pine doesn't. Instead, it specifically looks for a "Berkeley" boundary.

Some mailers upon forwarding a message will include the "Berkeley" boundary
along with the forwarded message's headers. It is understandable how this
behavior could fool pine, but not Solaris.

And, this was why Mr. Berens recommended the sendmail flags that generously
escape any embedded "<nl><nl>From ". This is available as some mailers don't
look for a "Berkeley" boundary but only that sequence.

hello Colin...

WE ARE RUNNING PINE 3.93 ON AIX 3.2.5 AND IT WORKS OK ON RISC 6000 570.

WE RECENTLY HAVE ANOTHER MACHINE RISC 6000 MODEL F50 CONNECTED UP
TO THE ABOVE MACHINE VIA ETHERNET TCIP, WITH THE USERS'S /home FILESYSTEM
NFS...  (NEW MACHINE RUNS AIX 4.2.1)

WE  USE rlogin WHENENVER WE NEED TO ACCESS pine IN THE OLD MACHINE....

THE PROBLEM IS , IT HAS PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS....IT COULD SOMETIMES TAKE
3 MINUTES TO GET INTO pine AND ALSO, USERS CAN GET "LOCKED" UP,
HENCE WE HAVE TO KILL THE PROCESS....

WE WONDER IF THERE IS A CLIENT-SERVER VERSION OF pine AND WONDER HOW
IT CAN ASSIST US...

FLORENCE

I sent you our solution off-list. I'd check with the Pine folks at U/Wash

As I said, our fix worked, but who knows how or why.

# are using Pine on a Unix system, there may be a system-wide
configuration
# file which sets the defaults for these variables.  There are comments in
# this file to explain each variable, but if you have questions about
# specific settings see the section on configuration options in the Pine
# notes.  On Unix, run pine -conf to see how system defaults have been set.
# For variables that accept multiple values, list elements are separated
# by commas.  A line beginning with a space or tab is considered to be a
# continuation of the previous line.  For a variable to be unset its value
# must be blank.  To set a variable to the empty string its value should
# be "".  You can override system defaults by setting a variable to the
# empty string.  Switch variables are set to either "yes" or "no", and
# default to "no".
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Pine.

Could you tell me why e-mails from people in the U.K. to me ( I am 
resident in the U.K. ) have the E.S.T and not G.M.T which it should be?

Requesting assistance in using Pine

I am wondering how to compose a message using PECO, then getting into the 
message section of an e-mail using tel-net pine.

Thank you

Heh! But, the French disagree. "European Standard Time"

Your date says "+0000 (GMT)". Is that a standard, to add zero, rather than
subtract it? And, what would it say at the International Date Line, east or
west of it?

according to my nifty neato chart (if you really want to know I think I
might be able to find the URL again) +0000 is the standard, and east of
the IDL is -1200 and west is +1200

however, in practice, for reasons I'm not yet able to discern, sometimes
the +s and -s go backwards. But the chart is still a great help in
figuring out which time zone other mail servers are in and tracking down
times-of-spamming.

BTW, I think it's possible that people in the UK could be using US mail
servers. I don't know if this is the case though. If the original sender
could send a header it might be easier to figure out what's going on.

>I am wondering how to compose a message using PECO,

I take it you mean pico, not PECO. man pico for a list of command-line
switches.

To use the editor, pico [file], and start composing. To exit, ^x. There are
almost no features, so you'll be an expert after one or two compositions.

>then getting into the message section of an e-mail using tel-net pine.

You use telnet to initiate a session on a remote computer on which you have an
account that's priviledged to run pine; you can't telnet directly into a pine
session.

Start the pine composer, either "c" from the main menu, or pine [address] to
bypass the main menu and go directly into the composer.

After filling in the rest of the headers, put the cursor in the body of the
message, hit ^r [file], and the text you composed outside of your pine session
is now in the body of the message. You may further edit it before sending.

i'm not sure what the answer is in pine.  i've had real trouble with this too. 
what i do now is use mailx. from your unix prompt type mailx
username@somewhere.net and hit enter.  you're now in mailx mailing to the
address you typed. typing   ~r filename  will insert that file within the mail. 
this works good if your trying to send ascii text.  conrl-d mails the letter.

But, that puts the text of [file] into the body of the message; that does not
attach the file to the message. As it happens, <ctrl> r works the same way in
pine.

have you tried typing the name of the file in the "Attchmnt:" portion of

	Hi, Does pine have a reject mail option? I've been receiving

Hi,

put a .forward file into your home directory in which your new address 
is stored. Sendmail (not pine) will forward the mail to the new
location ...

% echo "new-name@new-domain" > $HOME/.forward

For the second part ... if you will be using pine at your new site as
well, just copy the folder directory to disk and take them with you
or, either if you are to lazy to do so or if you don't have pine any
longer (and thus, folder formats might differ), forward your mails to
your new site.

hth, norbert.

No, this is not a task of pine. Use procmail (or any other filter
mechanism that's available for you). If it's not installed, ask you
system administrator, whether it's possible to install and configure
it.

Ah, a long time has passed since the last question of this sort has
appeared ... still, the answer is the same.

You can only change the Reply-To field of your mail
(setup/config/customized-hdrs). Read the online help on that entry.

In order to change the From line, you have to recompile pine allowing
this option. See the pine tech-notes for further information.

If you want to save a copy in your old mailsystem, use this format of the

\old-address,  new-address

The old-address is your standard E-mail address, and new-address is your
new or temporary.

The \ is an escape character which tells sendmail not to use the
.forward file again, and thereby prevent a loop.

I am having a recurring problem with my pine use and my local support
staff (at Loyola College in Baltimore) can't help me.

Frequently these days when I am trying to respond to a received message,
my computer suddenly locks up and dumps everything I have written, leaving
the message "improperly handled condition, image exit forced...register
dump."  This is unintelligible to me and I can't unfreeze the screen
except by cancelling everything and starting over.  The problem seems to
occur only when I am responding to someone's message rather than when I am
composing a new message.

Is this problem related to the fact that the block on the right-side
vertical scroll bar is always at the very bottom of the scroll bar, as if
I am at the end of some capacity.

Finally, when I log off, I go to main menu, hit "quit", expunge messages,
and then type "lo" at the prompt.  Am I doing something wrong?

I have a problem using pine from my Macintosh which is connected to the
internet through ethernet.  The problem only started happening a few days
ago, and I cannot fix the problem.

When I am in pine and I want to take an address by using the Take command,
everything is fine until I get thrown into the menu which looks like the
headers in a message which has the nickname, address, etc. which can be
toggled to by using the tab key.  The commands on the bottom are cancel,
get help, exit/save, etc.  Now at this stage, I can't get out of the
program.  It seems to crash.  There are also times when the program seems
to stall,   I am using NCSA Telnet 2.7 on a Powerbook 5300cs macintosh
with System 7.6 and the ethernet is through DAYNA/SCSI link.  I don't have
a problem with Eudora, Netscape, or Fetch.  So is there some bug in pine,
or is it the Telnet version I am using?  Sounds like my connection is not
that stable for Telnet anyway.

I have no problem from an xterminal which is what I am using now.

Thanks for your help.

I go to old dominion university and we have recently switched over to new
e-mail logins.  My login is sip200z.  My friend has the new login which is
kcafa001.  Her login will not work using the pine system, do you know why?

Please be more explicit.  "will not work" doesn't help.

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list are archived.  These archives can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

Please note: the mailing list is no longer mirrored in the comp.mail.pine 
newsgroup.

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Hi

	I'm having a slight problem in Pine (Linux) with my return
address.  The problem is that I log into my Linux box as "adventure" and I
log onto the net as "syoungs" (email address is "syoungs@ozemail.com.au").
Whenever I send an email from Pine it puts my return address as
"adventure@ozemail.com.au" which is wrong.

	How do I make it use the correct return address without creating a
"syoungs" user on my linux box?

	This is only a problem with out-going mail.

When you reply to this remember to change my email address to
"syoungs@ozemail.com.au".  Thanks for any assistance you can give.


Have A Great Day!!

Hello...

My name is Dexter Adams and I work for the IT Dept. I have a few questions 
regarding PINE 3.93.

We are using PINE for faxing and internet mail and have NFS mount the home 
file system on a AIX4.2 box and PINE runs on AIX 3.2.5 box.
We are facing very slow response times. We currently have 18 NSF demons
running and I wonder if this is the cause. I have fined tuned the network
and memory to carter for the burst of requests.

Pls fill me in if you have any info of how to improve the performance.

Thanks

Best Regards

Dexter

Set the Custom Header option in your Pine configuration to something like: 

    "From: Steve Youngs <syoungs@ozemail.com.au>"

If it complains when you try to send a message after doing this with
something like "Not allowed to change From: line", then you'll need to
re-compile pine with the option: 

#define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM  /* comment out to not allow changing From */

in osdep/os-xxx.h.

Get a filter, like procmail. It isn't a pine feature. See:

In trying to pull up in-mail, I'm getting a message at bottom of my
screen:"file/usr/spool/mail/dkeenan is not in valid mailbox format"
Believe this was an e-mail from someone that I responded to and tried
to delete their message and mine, and I must have hit something odd.
Any clues as to how to rid myself of this?
Thanks.

If your inbox is hosed, I don't know how you'll read this.

You need to tell us what kind of Unix your mail server uses, and what the
proper format your mailboxes should be in.

I will assume "Berkeley". You likely ruined the first line. This is the format
for a proper boundary:

>From ahk@chinet.chinet.com Sat Feb 14 15:35:54 1998

It must be the first line of the first message in a mailbox. For subsequent
messages, it must follow a blank line.

Copy your inbox to a tempory folder in your mail directory in your home
directory. Fix the file with a text editor, substituting the sample boundary
line I gave above for any broken lines. If all goes well, you should be able to
read the folder like any other message folder in pine. If you can read it, copy
your inbox to another file and delete your inbox. You should be able to read
any new messages. Look at the second copy of the inbox you made, and see if any
new messages were appended to it, and copy those messages with a text editor to
another temporary file in mail (preserving the boundary line, of course). And,
read these messages in pine.

It's not recommended that you edit your inbox directly, since other processes
are delivering messages to it.

I was directed by my computer to send you a message that my computer
discovered a "bug alert".  I'm reaslly not quite sure what this means but
it interrupted what I was doing, so it must be important.

You can't. It is a feature of your Mail Transport Agent. For instance, if it's
sendmail, you would create an alias file in your home directory. For the file
format, man aliases. You must be priviledged to run the newaliases command.

Your system administrator may consider this a security risk and not grant most
users such privileges.

Someone at your university likely runs a mailing list server, like LISTSERV,
Majordomo, or ListProc. Perhaps he would be willing to host your mailing list.

Hello everyone,

as I consider this problem somewhat special,
please reply to me directly.

Having used Pine for quite some time 
by telnet on a Linux machine with no probems whatsoever,
I now want to make it work for some others here
who prefer Win 3.11 as their interface - 
we still got so many PCs with it...

The Linux-smtp-server runs both smtp and pop3.
The PCs use Pathway Runtime 4.1.2 to access the server.
(previously Wallongong, I guess)

All other internet applications work well 
(browsers, ftp, telnet) but starting
	/pine/pine.exe 
from the Windows 3.11 surface only renders:

	[Host not found #11001: ---.---.---.--- ]
	[No folder opened] 
INBOX ? and later, trying to compose a message, no wonder:
	[can't send message without an open remote folder] 

Local PCPine setup configuration is:

	smtp-server: ---.---.---.--- (my server)
and either (as quoted in install.txt):
	inbox path:  {ditto ---.---.---.---}/var/spool/mail/myname
	inbox path:  {ditto ---.---.---.---}var/spool/mail/myname
	inbox path:  {ditto ---.---.---.---}INBOX

Neither result with
	inbox path:  var/spool/mail/myname
	inbox path:  /var/spool/mail/myname
	inbox path:  /var/spool/mail/
	inbox path:  /var/spool/mail
Pine still lets me know:
	[can't open mailbox var/spool/mail/myname: no such folder]
	[No folder opened] 
Strange: not even a password asked to access my account ?
No hint in install.txt so far.

Perhaps this does not occur for the first time. 
Something wrong with my stack ? Any other ideas ? 
Any hints welcome, please reply directly.

Kind regards,
hbk :-)

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest
* Filters out duplicates
* Keeps track of URLs already visited
* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week
* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
 Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
 Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
 Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

Hav you guys noticed that the references and In-Reply-To headers duplicate
the same purpose? In fact the USENET references header, which usually
includes all of the references in the message replied to, is more
complete. I'd recommend you discontinue this "In-Reply-To:" header, even
for IMAP or regular e-mail.

I'm using PINE 3.95 on a shared system. This version doesn't let me edit
the references header, even though I explicitly put "References:" in the
"customized-headers" section. The reason I want to edit these is that some
newsreaders display thread nesting, notably DejaNews, and this thread
nesting won't be correct unless you delete every reference but the anchor
and the articles you're quoting.

For getting off the thread's topic, you delete the anchor too. I bet
DejaNews ignores that, and it still makes sense.

Does PINE 3.96 let you edit references if you put "References:" in the
"customized-headers" section?

Pine 3.95 lets you set the Subject as a sorting key. I don't see a
secondary key section. Does PINE 3.96 let you further sort Subject by
thread? Or better yet, does it do basic threading?

You are unfamiliar with the history of the headers. The Usenet standard is RFC
1036 and most people agree that it was sloppily written.

The intent was to use the APRA Mail Message standard (RFC 822) for News
articles wherever possible. References in a mail message refers to the Message
ID of another mail message which is referred to in the body of the main
message. In-Reply-To indicates that this message is a reply to a specific
message. There is nothing in the Mail standard (RFC 822) that would have
prevented this header from containing the Message-IDs of earlier messages in
the thread.

Unfortunately, RFC 1036 changed this.

For a good discussion of header issues, see RFC 2076: Common Internet Message
Headers. While RFC 1036 remains the official Internet standard, well-behaved
news readers no longer follow it. They use, instead, another document which
never even made it to the RFC stage called "son-of-RFC1036: News Article Format
and Transmission", which you can ftp from zoo.toronto.edu. The file is called
news.txt.Z in the pub directory.

You may not edit this header, nor In-Reply-To. Furthermore, pine refused to
post a follow-up to what you claim was a news article, unless the Path header
is present. Without it, pine only posts to mail.

>The reason I want to edit these is that some newsreaders display thread

The thread nesting is correct as long as no one deliberately edits the
References header and sticks in a Message-ID that doesn't belong. Surely, you
have not found this to be a common problem.

>For getting off the thread's topic, you delete the anchor too. I bet
>DejaNews ignores that, and it still makes sense.

If you "get off the thread's topic", then don't post a followup! Begin a new
thread. If, on the other hand, the Subject header is no longer descriptive of
your followup article, change it! There is an informal way of doing that:

Subject: New topic (was: Old topic)

Some people leave the Re: in (was: Re: Old topic), but I think it looks silly.

Even more informally, if you followup to such a message, your subject should
read Subject: Re: New topic, deleting the parenthetical Old topic.

>Does PINE 3.96 let you edit references if you put "References:" in the
>"customized-headers" section?

No. This behavior is the same.

>Pine 3.95 lets you set the Subject as a sorting key. I don't see a secondary
>key section.

There isn't one. You'd have to select specific messages, save them to another
folder, and perform another primary sort on the second folder.

>Does PINE 3.96 let you further sort Subject by thread? Or better yet, does it
>do basic threading?

No threading yet; the only other option is Ordered Subject sort, which also
performs a "secondary" sort by date.

You want threading? Use trn.

RTFM. Hit the Help key in that window or grab a copy of the user guide. You
need to eXpunge as well, and you might want to set this in your .pinerc.

Well, in the address-book, same as in most other 'buffers' of pine, the 
'y' command causes the current contents to be printed ....

Hmm, perhaps, the best solution to your problem is a short pine How-To
given to your users (that's RTFM in other words :-); or, even better,
force them to write a test on the pine tech-notes, section
'Configuration and Preferences' as well as the commands and the use of 
the Online Help system :-)

l8er, norbert.

Hi,

you first have to transfer the file (the forthcoming attachment) to
your account at the university where pine is looking for it. Ask your
system administrator how to get the transfer handled (normally using
an ftp programme).

Is there anyway that I can send an instant message to someone or talk back
and forth to someone via this program "PINE".  I would also like to know
how to get in chat rooms via PINE.

Dear Sir:

It seems to me that PINE could read riched text sent by audora etc., could
I used PINE to send a riched text. I tried to change the sending-filter to
'/..../richtext' but it did not work.

Thanks.

Best regards

Hi,

no, pine is a mail back-end, not an interactive tool. 'man talk' should
give you information about those.

  Hi there.

  When sending a mail with attachments in pine v3.96, the mail goes
away even if the attachments are not found, with only a warning:
(I have "background sending enabled", dunno if it matters)
As a result, you have to resent the mail correctly afterwards, and ask
pardon for the previous mail.

  Is that a bug or a feature? :)


  Greetings,
  Thanasis.

I would like to know why I cannot cancel (^C) a message while in the
middle.  This command performs no function.  I would like it to forget I
ever started the message, and take me back to my current index or the main
menu.  Instead I have to postpone, because ^C does nothing, and a lot of
the time I don't want to postpone.  

Also, I accidentally 'took away' a name from my addressbook to another
address book; but I only have one address book.  I can still use the
address, but it appears twice when in key in the nickname.  How do I
render this?

Much appreciation
paul

We were having a discussion of time zones. What does this stand for?

I assume you mean attachment in the MIME sense. I cannot reproduce your error.
With the cursor in the headers, I hit ^j, typed in a nonexistent file name and
got an immediate error message. I was prevented from adding that file name.

Then, after ^r, I put the cursor on Attachments and added a bad file name. I
got an error message upon leaving that line, but the line wasn't blanked.
However, I was still prevented from sending with a bad attachment name.

Can you post additional details of your platform and setup to the list?

I'm assuming your using Unix pine via a remote computer. If not, please post
full details of your platform and setup. Your terminal emulation may not be
sending ^c when you press it. Verify that local comm program is emulating VT100
or VT102, and that your remote shell is set for TERM=vt100 or 102.

Or, this keystroke may not be passed through on the remote end. In that case,
"esc esc c" is a workaround.

You accidently made a distribution list. Go into the addressbook ("a" from the
main menu) and delete one of the duplicate lines.

For more information about distribution lists, read the context-sensitive help
text while you are in the addressbook.

Sir, 
I am using your s/w for E.mail. It is cumbersome and
amaturish in finish. You should develop s/w for 'Dummys' and not expect us
to be BillGates.
One simple example: My disc is full in my "sent mail" file and I try to
tranfer it to my pc thro' Kermit selection. But everyone of my command is
'invalid'. So I go on without it being recorded in sent file. Of course, I
have more problems to inform but it all depends how you take this.Bye.

I didn't write pine. I use it, and sometimes answer a few questions on this
mailing list.

You sent an insulting message, so that's how I'm taking it. Rather than a
manual called "pine for dummies", you could best benefit from ettiquette
lessons. Rudeness and demanding help won't win you any friends.

You are incapable of dealing with your system's quota? That isn't pine's fault;
that's yours. You are incapable of understanding how to use Kermit? Again, you
are at fault.

Your problems are off-topic on this list. Don't post any further messages.

Hard to argue that it's a feature...
"background sending enabled" almost surely matters.
(Without that feature enabled, you'd be put back in the composer
 when Pine realized the attachment didn't exist.)

Adam just pointed out to me that he had "background sending enabled" 
when he tried and failed to reproduce this problem, so just pretend
I didn't open my mouth... I have no clue why Thanasis might be having
trouble.

(Thanks Adam).

That's a grave mistake. Our s/w is not meant to be used for E.mail.
Actually, it is intended to replace your dishwasher, wireless, and Tibetan

That is very true, and we deplore this fact. However, we are currently
working on a revised version, that will have buttons for temperature, fine
tuning and the like. You'll love it.

Yeah, right! We made this piece of software with you as a Dummy/BillGates in
mind. We are sorry it didn't work out. Would you mind sharing your knowledge
in the field of dumminess with us so that we could actively deteriorate our
s/w, please?

Well, first of all, you need a new disk. Next, try Mrs. Piggy selection
instead of Kermit.

You should pick sturdier people, then.

Pity, isn't it? But who cares?

We take this very seriously. In fact, we take you very seriously. Have you
considered looking for professional help? If not, you should. Really.

  Hello again.

  I seem to have omitted a crucial fact:

  You type in the attachment file name (pine finds it, so it puts its
full path name in the "Attchments" list), prepare the mail, and then
(before sending it) you ... delete (!) the files, because you don't want
them any more.

  THEN, the mail goes away, (probably because "background sending
enabled"), and afterwards you get a message about the attachment not
having been found.

  Since the "error" is discovered anyway, I think it would be better if it
was done before you sent a (halved) mail.


  Thanasis.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,

I've been experimenting with Pine and like many of its
features. However, to convert, I would need to be
able to use the external pager "less" in place of the
default Pine pager.

I've searched the documentation and pine-info archives but 
could not determine 1) Whether this is possible and 2) If so, 
then how?

Can any of you help?

Please reply directly since I do not subscribe to the list.

Thanks IA,
Felix

Oh, now I understand. I guess when they developed the background sending code,
they didn't anticipate that a user would delete the file to be attached before
the message got into the mail queue.

What can pine do about it at this point? I believe when the "send" has been
placed in background, that the MTA has been invoked at this point. The MTA now
has control of the message, not pine.

The question becomes, are there any MTAs that have such a feature?

This is beyond the realm of my knowledge. I believe that the MTA create the
envelope receipient, not pine. Is that correct? If so, I take it that the MTA
would ignore all other headers except those necessary to create the envelope.

"Doctor, it hurts when I do this." "Well, stop doing that."

What can I tell you? Don't delete the file to be attached. I suppose you could
put it into a temporary directory in your home directory, and establish a cron
job to delete it after several hours.

Is there a way to move entire "folders" in PINE?
i.e. - move the complete "INBOX" folder to a "temp"
folder, then move a complete "****" folder to "INBOX"
(for download {offline email reading} purposes as opposed to
having to "export" every single mail msg. individually)
then move the "temp" contents back to "INBOX"?
If I've missed something in the online documentation, please
accept my apologies.
Please advise return email at your earliest convenience.
Many thanks.

Does anyone know how to make this little character that I had to weasle my =
way
around placing in this message?  I hope it stays the same as it is right no=
w.


=B3

You'll note that if you copy this little 3 and paste it the result is a lar=
ge
3.  Is it an ALT+nnn combination that I use in PINE to get it?  Does any of
this make sense?

Nonsense!

It is a Pine feature.  It is called sent-mail.  He must look for the
"sent-mail" folder.  Merely, hit L, and you'll see it.

Suddenly I am informed that my folder: inbox(readonly).  Why is this?
What can be done to switch it back?  I suppose it must be a server bug.

Dear Forum,

	Is there any way to find out what time a mail was recieved. I try
converting between the time zones in the date stamp on the mail to find
out when it was written. But might as well read the time it was recieved
to get an idea of when it was sent.

	But how does one do that

Try piping.

Also you should type ^Y (not sure why, but just trial-and-error here, as I
go).  I don't know what the options are really all about, maybe they are
not documented.

Now type: 

less

or

more

or something or other.  

By the way, I've *tried* using more or less when in Tin reading news
articles.  Wanting to be able to scroll up and down some long messages a
line at a time.  But, this seems to result in some weirdness.  Somehow, at
some point, the whole account integrity falls apart.  The UNIX shell would
start acting oddly.  It seemed kind of random, and no telling what it was
all about.

well, your thinking character 254, but apparently pine doesn't like
alt-<anything above 127>

I know, this was not exactly the worlds most helpful answer :)

I didn't read carefully; I thought he meant sent "to", instead of "by".

It's the default behavior, you are correct.

You don't argue against References and In-Reply-To being duplicate though. 
In fact you provide more evidence of the fact, enabling In-Reply-To: to
hav multiple IDs.

Tkx. Wil view. If that answers not, I'll see RFC1036.

No. I have wondered if <ftp://zoo.toronto.edu/new.txt.Z> would be an
invalid reference, even if few news-readers would parse and follow it. 
Lynx uses "X-URL: http://..." to comment on HTML, and I see no reason not
to allow including that reference in either In-Reply-To: or References:.

You'd just put them in <> and ignore non-news articles for threading.
You'd assume articles wer news by default.
Examples:
	<PINE.3.95.A41.AAAAAAAA.FFFFFF@news.shareworld.com>
	<mailto:oracle@cs.indiana.edu//subject="help"/send>
	<http://www.freenet.edmonton.ab.ca/>

Generally though, I only want access to References: to delete references
to articles I DON'T refer to. Many newsreaders, PINE included, don't
mention other articles in the reply's body automatically, so I imagine
deleting unintended references or In-Reply-Tos can't be mechanized
accurately.

You could get an incomplete reference-not list by eliminating user IDs and
names not mentioned in the body.

AltaVista lets you view documents referred to. Let me cut the clutter by
deleting references not used.

I don't understand why getting off the thread's topic and having a reason
to change the subject are on different hands.

Unless this informality becomes standard, these will always be two threads
separated by O,P, and Q. I prefer to go straight to the new topic, even
though following up to something in a different thread.

My reasoning is simple: The reference is there if your reader can follow
it.. Most newsreaders won't attempt to thread articles with different
subjects: that might result some kind of tree.

AltaVista and DejaNews on the other hand let you see how someone could be
following-up to an article and be starting a thread at the same time: the
last reference would be in a different thread, maybe even in a different
group.

> Some people leave the Re: in (was: Re: Old topic), but I think it looks silly.

I think it's silly to mention the old topic in a new thread: Write two
articles unless you're relating two topics.

> You want threading? Use trn.

There's a host of trade-offs between Tin and PINE. Generally I prefer
PINE, kuz if the modems hav been 100% loaded for the last five minutes, I
hav a 1hr session limit and Tin's way of postponing articles is very
messy: you post them, mail them to yourself and cancel them. I'm serious.
I've never bothered to check if it has an automatic save & restart, kuz it
has no save-working-text or postpone.

But, in mail, it isn't traditional to have more than one Message-ID in
In-Reply-To. It should be assumed that most MUAs would choke, and newsreaders
would ignore it. It's an unfortunate situation that we're stuck with.

>No. I have wondered if <ftp://zoo.toronto.edu/new.txt.Z> would be an

Heh. That would be, since the file's called news.txt.Z.

Don't do it, because comments must be in parethesis, not angle brackets.
Son-of-1036 has a good discussion of this very issue. These lines must only
contain precursor Message-IDs. Web pages can't be precursors. This is a
standard format, therefore it can be used to move along the article tree.

>You'd just put them in <> and ignore non-news articles for threading.
>You'd assume articles wer news by default.

Although, if I had stored both news and mail on my system in mail format, it
would be nice to go back and forth along the thread, if some of it came in
private mail replies. But, you are suggesting using URL format which won't be
recognized by existing News readers for the purpose you suggest. Proper News
readers have no trouble using the Message-IDs to find the articles.

>Generally though, I only want access to References: to delete references

You are missing the point. You want articles that you write to be properly
threaded when read by others. You have no control over what articles have and
have not expired on news servers. The more Message-IDs of precursor articles
you leave on the References header, the more likely your article can be
properly threaded when it arrives on another news server.

In Mail, References is used so that the reader can refer to other mail messages
that aren't precursors in the thread to this message. Son-of-1036 suggested a
new header in News for this purpose: See-Also. He also suggested that gateways
convert References between In-Reply-To and See-Also as appropriate, although he
did admit that if a thread-precursor References header were left in a Message
converted from News to Mail that mail readers wouldn't choke on it.

>You could get an incomplete reference-not list by eliminating user IDs and
>names not mentioned in the body.

Yes, the person writing the new message should do that anyway.

>AltaVista lets you view documents referred to. Let me cut the clutter by
>deleting references not used.

Again, that's not how References is used in News; don't do it.

>>thread. If, on the other hand, the Subject header is no longer descriptive of

Some people read a News article and post a followup that is irrelevant to that
article. That's the first hand. Other people post a valid followup to an
article just read that contains nothing of the Subject of the message that
began the article tree, but fail to change the Subject. That's the second hand.

>>There is an informal way of doing that:

No; the thread means the precursor articles, not all articles with a specific
Subject. An article tree is a group of articles that are all successors to the
same article. Are all articles with Subject: Help!!!!! in the same thread?

As I said, it's an informality, and it's controversial having an article with a
transition Subject. I do it, but lots of people don't.

>My reasoning is simple: The reference is there if your reader can follow
>it. Most newsreaders won't attempt to thread articles with different

But, the ability to do it should be left intact. It's sort of a convention that
became established before threading News readers were available. As users
become more advanced and realize what they are missing, they'll start using
News readers that provide additional functionality.

>AltaVista and DejaNews on the other hand let you see how someone could be
>following-up to an article and be starting a thread at the same time: the last
>reference would be in a different thread, maybe even in a different group.

Again, that's the same thread, but with a new Subject. The interface the 2 are
using recognizes the Message IDs on the References header and converts them
into URLs to help navigate around their own servers. Which is fine.

There is no good reason for News articles to be composed with precursor
Message-IDs in URL format.

>>Some people leave the Re: in (was: Re: Old topic), but I think it looks
>>silly.

>I think it's silly to mention the old topic in a new thread: Write two

Nah, what usually happens is that the original Subject should have been changed
3 articles earlier in the thread, and you are getting around to changing it!

>>You want threading? Use trn.

>There's a host of trade-offs between Tin and PINE.

Not tin; trn.

This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:

DEAR SIRS:

I have been using PINE for a number of years and like it very much.

Right now I cannot use PINE..

When I attempt to transmit a message I get a screen that says:-


                                       APPLICATION ERROR

                           PINE caused a General Protection Fault                                           
                               in module PINE.EXE at 0001:143A

                                                    CLOSE


What is this error?

Is there any way I can clear it?

I re-loaded PINE but that did not help.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Howard Atlas

I suppose, another pine process is keeping a lock on your inbox
file. Have a look, ie 

ps -ux | grep pine ; kill <PID>
ps -ef | ...

If this doesn't fit, look for the lock-file ... have a glance at the
tech-notes about folder locking.


hth, norbert.

I use PC-Pine, and typing <ALT>252 results in the small 3.

In fact <ALT>251 gives a small 1, ""   ""
        <ALT>252 gives a small 3, ""   ""
        <ALT>253 gives a small 2, ""   ""

The beginning of the three lines above, included the first small integer
are created with PC-Pine.
Then I postponed the answer and left PC-Pine.

The second small integer in each line is then added in Unix-Pine.

No problem at all, just type.  ;-)

I can copy and paste the small integers without any problem from Pine to
Pine or Notepad.

Now 3.96 has been here for a year. When will 4.00 come?

Also, I have a suggestion for a new feature:

Configurable "From:", "Reply-to:", "signature", and "smtp-server", etc... 
for each incoming mailbox, if one want to...
This would greatly ease things for us with several e-mail addresses that
get our e-mail forwarded to one single address but still want to be known
as the original address when replying, sending, etc...

Thanks for the info :-) But that's for Linux, do you know whether all
those other 'well supported' Un*x systems provide the command?

Yup, agreed that's a feature which would be totally cool. How about it
U/Wash?? Is this likely to happen?

I lost my /home directory, and had to restore from backup. When I
restored, pine comes up with


     [Can't open mailbox inbox: no such folder]

I've tried setting inbox-path to INBOX, inbox, /var/mail/kweiske, and
other iterations. Root can read mail, but any other users get the same
message. Any idea what I'm missing?

As far as I can tell, all the permissions are identical to permissions
on a working Solaris 2.3 machine we have running.

<I have tried dejanews, and the pine-info archive but no luck>

I'm struggling with opera and pcpine to try and get a mail message with a
description of the form

Content-type: text/html; charset=us-ascii;name="netnews240298.htm"

to launch opera. I can get a normal attached .html file to launch it no
worries but the above type of email just appears as the html text in the
normal pine viewer.

My mailcap file has

text/html;c:\progra~1\opera\opera.exe %s

in it, and as I said if I send myself a .html file as an attachment, opera
launches no worries.

thanks,
davidp.

A superlative suggestion sir, with just two minor flaws: one, we don't
have any defensive shields and two, we don't have any defensive shields.
I know that, technically, that's only one flaw, but it was such a big one
I thought I'd mention it twice.

I can't figure out how to make Version 3.95 do this.

I selected three pieces of spam to return to the offender's postmaster,
and tried to FORWARD them along with my rules regarding commercial use of
my address. That attached the first one and ignored the other two selected
messages.

When I tried putting the messages in files and attaching them, PINE put
them in BASE 64, despite their having only ascii characters: TEXT/PLAIN
(whatever that means) for a type would've been fine.

I wound up hitting ^R, inserting my INBOX, and deleting the other spam.

Does version 3.96 support multiple message attachments?
I'm looking for a compelling reason for my operator to upgrade.

Commercial e-mail cannot be sent to this address, using my time and
resources without my explicit permission, which I grant you only if your
quotes of me show all of your product information relevant to me, on
condition you stop addressing me within 5 working days of my saying to,
and distribute no information about my address other than this paragraph.

Breach of the above paragraph will probably result in my lobbying for
service denials to you or your service provider.
Forged e-mail headers, according to RFC 822, may constitute fraud in

It works fine for me, but it may be something in your terminal set up.
What sort of set up are you using? (IE OS(es), is pine local or remote?
How do you access it? etcetc)

try going into the mail directory for your account (usually $HOME/mail on
*nix systems) and just moving the file. This works for me. I don't know
how well this would work in any other environment, though.

Hi,

for the xxxth time, disk quota exceeded means that the disk space
assigned to you is 'no more'. In order to get things running again,
remove some files you no longer need (or backup them and remove them
afterwards).

'man quota' and 'man rm' might give you some hints.


Ed, please ask those guys at vsnl to

[x] assign more disk quota to their users
[x] give them a short un*x howto before installing the account

just kiddin', norbert.

Hi all.
We use UNIX operating system. I couldn't find the error. 
I connect a machine with the "a" username to the machine1. I open pine
inbox  with the usename "b" inbox at the machine2. I am the user "a" at 
the machine1 now. When I send a email to the any person the form line of
the mail is a@machine2. I want it to be b@machine2 What can I do. I set
the user-domain = machine2, smtp-server= machine2 at the
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf file. 
     
What you I have to do?

Is there a way to compose a message in pc-pine without having a remote

I want to compose messsages offline, postpone them, and then send them

Thanks.

Hello,
	I was wondering if you can tell me how to view attachments.
Every time I try to view it, it tells me that I can't.  It suggests that I
save it and it goes to my home directory.  Unfortunately, I don't know
what or where the home directory is and don't know how to access it.   Any
help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Is there any way to create custom MIME types for pine to use, with extra
parameters?

I'm trying to use pine to send faxes via TPC.INT using the MIME type for
extra cover sheet information:

BEGIN extract from http://www.tpc.int/faq/tpcfaq.html#Cover :


A MIME content-type has been defined for this. It's called
application/remote-printing. Here's an example: 

    Content-Type: application/remote-printing        Recipient:
Darren Nickerson        Organization:   University of Oxford
Department:     New Chemistry Lab        Telephone:      +44 1865 275975
Facsimile:      +44 1865 271503        Email:
darren.nickerson@balliol.oxford.ac.uk            Originator:     Mr.
Arlington Hewes        Organization:   The Phone Company - International
Department:     Administration        Telephone:      +44 1234 123456
Facsimile:      +44 1234 123457        Email:
tpcadmin@info.tpc.int        Any text appearing here would go on the
cover-sheet.

[That lot is all on one line in the original]

To use this mechanism, the top-level content in your message must be
multipart/mixed, and the very first content in that must be
application/remote-printing.

END extract

Any way to do this?

Thanks, 
Seb Wills

I finally quit grinning over this one enough to answer it. This is really
a "I get a stabbing pain in my eye when I drink tea" sort of problem...

don't leave the spoon in.

What are you doing that you require that you not have to type in at least
one letter (ie why don't you give him/her a nickname of 'a' and then just
type 'a')?

if you can't type the 'a', tell us why and maybe we can come up with a
solution....

You misunderstood the purpose of the MIME types recognized by tpc.int.
application/remote-printer is strictly for information on the cover sheet
(basically, to whom the fax should be delivered), not for the contents of the
fax itself.

Full details are on the tpc.int site. There's actually a mailing list to
discuss tpc.int. tpc.int is an international experimental e-mail-to-fax
gateway. The locations to which faxes may be sent are limited, and there are no
service guarantees. Furthermore, your fax is delivered with a full-page cover
sheet, which briefly describes tpc.int and may contain advertising to help
defray some of the marginal costs. The service is free, and no one makes any
money doing it. It's not appropriate for sending faxes that are time-sensitive.
Sometimes it can take days to get a fax through the queue.

All sites impose strict usage limits, to discourage the service from being used
by those who send unwanted advertisements via fax.

Briefly, there are 2 ways to use the e-mail-to-fax gateway. One way is to
compose a message in one of several graphics formats identified as compatible
with the project. You send these as an attachment, not in the body of the
message.

pine makes attachments easy: You put the cursor in the headers, hit
^j, and name the file to attach. pine takes care of the boundaries.

pine sends all attachments in Base-64 encoding. pine will recognize PostScript,
and that's one of the MIME types that tpc.int recognizes. pine will
automatically use the correct headers, then.

The other way is to send pure ASCII in the body of the message, and not worry
about MIME at all. This is also descriped on the tpc site.

All tools for properly composing fax binaries are on the tpc site. It's quite
complete. It's free.

Ahem. He didn't misunderstand. I misread his plain English.

I apologize.

The rest of my message was not helpful in addressing his question.

The short answer is, no, pine does not recognize application/remote-printing,
and that to use it, you'd be better off with one of the mailers recommended by
tpc.int, and available there.

Robin, this user is so clueless that any clues given her will undoubtably be
used to destroy civilization as we know it.

I greatly object to the help you gave her. My God, she's not toilet trained.
You have taken a great burden upon yourself, and are now completely responsible
for her actions till she dies.

	This is Jessica Perich at email: jap1.ms1@allen.col.edu
There is a problem with my emailing. It seems that I have obtained a bug
somewhere in the system. Whenever I send messages to Angela Bitner at
email: stalbOl@moravian.edu the messages get sent back to me from The Mail
Delivery Service from a Mailer-Daemon. Please rid this viru from my system
so that I can successfully email my friend.

The feature-list in Pine 4.00 will have

allowing what you see here...

The Pine Team does read pine-info and they get alot of ideas here.
It's actually (IMHO) exactly where such ideas should be hashed out!

Now this is the sort of thing that should be in alt.flame instead of

Newsgroups: news.announce.newusers,news.answers

			"Dear Emily Postnews"

	Emily Postnews, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
	gives her advice on how to act on the net.

============================================================================

Q: Dear Ms. Postnews: I couldn't get mail through to somebody on another
site.  What should I do? -- eager@beaver.dam

A: Dear Eager: No problem, just post your message to a group that a
lot of people read.  Say, "This is for John Smith.  I couldn't get
mail through so I'm posting it.  All others please ignore."

This way tens of thousands of people will spend a few seconds scanning
over and ignoring your article, using up over 16 man-hours their
collective time, but you will be saved the terrible trouble of
checking through Usenet maps or looking for alternate routes.  Just
think, if you couldn't distribute your message to 30,000 other
computers, you might actually have to (gasp) call directory assistance
for 60 cents, or even phone the person.  This can cost as much as a
few DOLLARS (!)  for a 5 minute call!

And certainly it's better to spend 10 to 20 dollars of other people's
money distributing the message then for you to have to waste $9 on an
overnight letter, or even 32 cents on a stamp!

Don't forget.  The world will end if your message doesn't get through,
so post it as many places as you can.


Yo, Mr. Miller!  <a href="news://news.announce.newusers">See you</a>.

Those are programs that should be included in your Linux
distribution. Hylafax is a fax package for almost any flavour of unix,
and IIRC Dos95 as well. mail2fax is a perl script IIRC (haven't used
it for more than a year) that converts mail to fax.

In short: yes, it can be done, but you'll probably not be able to do
it unless you've got a computer of your own. Sysadmins tend to dislike =

the idea of people sending faxes over their modem lines.

Hello, C,

Certainly. We here at the pine list always try to help people in the
nicest possible way. Would you prefer a zip or a tgz file? If
requested, I can send you some server mirrors via email, too.

Your humble servant,

Robin

HEY!! IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME EASY _LEGAL_ CASH THIS IS THE PERFECT
WAY
 TO
 DO IT, YOU JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY AND THAT'S IT!
 
 THE FIRST THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT THIS ONLY WORKS IF EVERYBODY IS
 HONEST AN FOLLOW THE RULES PRECISLY! YOU DO NOT HAVE TO INVEST MORE
THAN
 5 DOLLAR$,AND THATS NOT MUCH,THINKING OF HOW MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO
MAKE!
 THIS REALY WORKS,I KNOW BECAUSE LAST TIME I DID THIS I MADE EXACTLY
 12158 DOLLARS!! THAT IS NOT BAD! SO IF YOU REALY WANT TO MAKE SOME
 CASH, ENTER THIS CHAIN AND MAKE SOME MONEY!
 (I DON'T LIE! I REALY MADE 12158 DOLLARS, -THIS ONE WORKS-)
 
 HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:
 
 I ONCE AGAIN HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT;IF YOU CHEAT, DONT FOLLOW THE
 RULES,THIS
 WONT WORK!!!PLEASE DO NOT!
 
 *STEP_1
 TAKE 5 ENVELOPES AND PUT ONE DOLLAR BILL IN EACH OF THEM.
 (THE INVESTMENT +(STAMP FEE))
 
 THEN WRITE THE ADDRESSES BELLOW (1-5) ON THE ENVELOPES
 
 *STEP_2
 EDIT THE ADDRESS LIST SO THAT THE FIRST NAME(1) DISSAPEARS AND MOVE ALL
 NAMES ON THE LIST -ONE- STEP UP.
 PUT YOUR NAME AT NUMBER FIVE(5)
 AND DELETE THE ADDRESS THAT ONCE WERE NR_1
 
 *STEP_3
 SEND THIS LETTER _WITH_ THE CHANGED ADDRESSES TO AT LEAST 10 NEW
PERSONS
 OR PLACES!
 EATHER A OUT PRINT AND SEND BY MAIL OR UPLOAD IT TO 10 DIFFERENT BBSS
 OR
 *e-MAIL IT TO 10 DIFFERENT PERSONS OR EVEN MAILING LISTS OR EVEN PUT IT
 IN
 A _LOT_ OF NEWSGROUPS (THE MORE THE BETTER)
 OR WHY NOT PUT IT UP ON YOU INTERNET SITE AS A DOWNLOAD?
 
 THIS IS THE HARD PART OF IT ALL!(BECAUSE EVERY ONE CAN SPARE 5
 BUCKS!,YOU
 DO IT ON CRAP ANYWAY EACH DAY! WHY NOT DO THIS!
 
 *STEP_4
 NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT!
 IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,DOLLAR BILLS AR STARTING TO COME TO YOU BY MAIL!
 AND MORE,AND MORE) IN TWO WEEKS OR SO,YOU WILL BE DROWNED IN ONE DOLLAR
 BILLS! (I DID)
 
 ***OK-THIS IS HOW IT WORKS***
 
 IF YOU SENT ONLY 10 LETTERS, MAILS, ETC.:
 -FIRST YOU RECIVE 10 DOLLARS FROM THE FIRST 10 YOU SENT IT TO!
         (YOU ARE NR_5 ON THE LIST)
 -THEN THISE 10 FIX 10 NEW,THATS 10X10=100 DOLLARS
         (NOW YOU ARE NR_4 ON THE LIST)
 -THEN THESE 100 FIX 10 EACH,THATS 100X10=1000 DOLLARS
         (NOW 3RD ON THE LIST)
 -THEN THESE 1000 FIX 10 EACH,THATS 1000X10=10000 DOLLARS
         (NOW 2ND ON THE LIST)
 -THEN THESE 10000 FIX 10 EACH,THATS 10000X10=100.000 DOLLARS
         (NOW 1ST ON THE LIST)
 
         AND NOW YOUR NAME HAS DISSAPEARED FROM THE LIST AND YOU MADE
 111.110 DOLLARS!!!!
 (PRECUMING THEY ONLY SPRED IT TO 10 PLACES!, CHAIN REACTION!)
 
 OK,NOW YOU ARE SAYING; BUT I CAN CHEAT,I CAN PUT MY SELF ON THE FIFTH
 PLACE
 AND NOT SEND ANY CASH TO THE OUTHER ONES...YEPP,BUT IF EVERY ONE DID
 THAT,
 WOULD YOU RECIVE ANY CHASH? NOPE! THEREFORE I BEG TO YOU ;DO NOT
 CHEAT!!!!
 
 JUST SENT THE DAMN 5 BUCKS, ITS NOT MUCH!! _THINK IN THAT WAY INSTEAD_
)
 
 WELL, I HOPE YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS AND START YOUR NEW WELLFAIR!
 100.000 IS NOT TO KID ABOUT!
 ONE MORE THING; KEEP THIS LETTER AS IT IS, _ONLY_ ALTER THE ADDRESES
 HOPE YOU DO THIS, I MADE 11347 DOLLARS ON IT IN TWO WEEKS, HA!
 
 AND
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT CHEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Contray to what what has been said already....it certainly is possible
and it is "free".

Visit http://fax.phone.net   There is also an RFC on the subject.
The drawback is a *long* email address needs to be constructed and
you have to "think" backwards!  For example if you want to send me
a FAX in Taiwan you would address me...

remote-printer.Ed_Greshko@7.9.1.9.2.1.7.2.2.6.8.8.tpc.int

The web page I've indicated is a good place to verify that a FAX "should"
make it to you destination.

Good Luck...

Hi,
My name is Christian and I have exceeded my quota on my account, because
of a couple of attachments that someone sent me and that I don't even know
how to open. I would like to konw two things: How do I open these
attachments and how do I delete them from my account so that I can respect
the quota and then do normal things like update my address book, for
instance (This is a command that I cannot use right now because my quota
is exceeded).

Thanks for  your help,
			Christian

this ought to be in the faq...

Anyway, 

a. delete some old stuff you aren't using (save it off to floppy, tar/gz
it, whatever..make it take up less space)

b. while looking at the message hit 'v'iew and then highlight the
attachment and hit 's'ave.

depending on how quotas are done at your site.. ie if it is total
diskspace or /var/spool/mail diskspace is considered separate from
/home/user/ diskspace...you'll probably have to do a first..but not
nesscesarily...

Dear Forum,

	I have been using the select [;] and apply [A] commands in the
mail folders for some time on our Pine 3.95. 

	However suddenly now there seems to be a problem in that it says
that they commands not defined for that screen. 

	Is there some setting required in the setup to activate/deactivate
these commands
