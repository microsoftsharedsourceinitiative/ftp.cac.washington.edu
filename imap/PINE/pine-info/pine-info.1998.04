I am an extensive user of the email software application PINE and an
highly infulenced by the functionalities that it provides.

But please can you help me out to set the option for saving all the files

Waiting for a reply soon as right know i have to move them physically and
it does tend to become tedious.

Please help.

That's most likely a local and not a pine problem. Talk to your
sysadmin and have her check what's wrong.

Margaret, it wasn't made recently. It was made while I was still
playing Space Quest I on an XT.[1]

Very true. Here's a suggestion for pine 4: include a copy of the
netiquette. I don't have the user guide at hand, but I'm pretty sure
it's not in there.

If I had written that, I'd be Ms. Netiquette now. But I didn't. Kathy
Rinaldi did, and her website is a place everyone should have visited
at least once.[2]

Later,

This is totally braindead, but will work if your folders are called
IN.something (I got that one from Nancy McGough's filtering mail FAQ)[1]:

#!/bin/sh
for i in ~/Mail/IN.* ; do cat $i >> ~/Mail/OLD/$i ; done
for i in ~/Mail/IN.* ; do rm $i ; touch $i ; done

Robin

Footnotes: 
[1]  The first person to comment on the braindeadness of this script
     will be publically dismembered. It is actually the first shell
     script I ever wrote (back in 1991), and I kinda like it...

If you are using UNIX pine, then you'll have to "view" the attachment and
save the file(s).  Once you saved it, you have to download it from your unix
account to a PC that can run the *.EXE file

<1> Should have a delete command to select attachments to exclude, for keep=
ing
    mail archives small in size.

    Temporary solution:  Use "export" to export the text message part to
    certain mail folder file.  It's also ok to "export" with "append" to
    the same folder as holding current email.

<2> Add option in setup to "force 8-bit smtp" to support unencoded 8bit
    char, because most new smtp relay now supports 8-bit clean transfer, an=
d
    many users are still using simple email handler with MIME support, such
    as mailx.

<3> Add option in setup to enable edit of "From:" header.  Though I know it=
's
    configurable in the compiling stage.  But pop3 users and those masked b=
y
    certain filewalls might need this feature as in netscape/eudora.

<4> Enable ^C to break hanged smtp/imap/pop/nntp connection.

<5> Add documentation about pop3 mbox setup in Unix PINE, ie.,
    {pop3_server/pop3/user=3Dusername}INBOX

<6> For users' convenience, add more default headers, such as "Reply-to:",
    "Return-receipt-to:".

<7> Each news folder should have seperate .newsrc file, such as
    .newsrc.newsserver1, .newsrc.newsserver2, etc.  netscape does in this w=
ay,
    which is pretty good.

<8> Improve threading of news articles based on "Reference:" header.

<9> Simplify subscription/unsubscription of groups of newsgroups, make it a=
s
    easy as the reg-pattern subscription/unsubscription in tin.

wow. and I used to use popfetch.

But then, I use IMAP now, which is nicer, I think.

Hello,
	I just have a quick question.  How can I retrieve the mail that
has been placed into other files?  For example at the end of each month my
mail gets erased and placed some where else.  How do  I get to it?  Thank
you for your help in answering my question.


						Sincerely yours,

Should ask for keeping IMO. I hardly ever keep attachments, especially 
not v-cards and other Dos-crap.

It's in pine 4.

Dunno. I would broaden this request to clean up the C-c, E(xit),
Q(uit) stuff.

It's extensively dealt with in the documentation. However, it would be
a Good Thing if the documentation for Pine 4 were done in SGML or at
least LaTeX, so it can be printed out nicely and given to users. I
volunteer for that again.

It can be easily done, can't it?

I would broaden this to "add more command line switches". mutt and
slrn are a lot better in this respect (eg -a <filename> to include an
attachment). 

> <8> Improve threading of news articles based on "Reference:" header.

There is no threading in pine. IIRC, it's planned for pine 4, but you
might want to check the pine website.

Why don't you use slrn or tin right away? Pine is a nice enough MUA
but a really, really sucky newsreader. A --without-news --without-docs
compile switch would be nice. Pine is, after all, freaking huge.

Later,
Robin

I keep getting a message that another pine is accessing my inbox.  Then it
will only let me read my messages and not delete any.  Is this a security
problem?

You are running more than one instance of pine at the same time. Say: 

    ps ax | grep pine
and then 
    kill <PID>
to kill the other instances of pine. If you're unsure about those
commands, say "man ps" and "man kill".

No.

"Can Pine be used with a POP server?" had been in the FAQs at
http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/FAQs.html for some time, but without
the "/user=username" part, which can certainly be useful. I just added
that.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

It was suggested that I write this group with a question I have. Perhaps 
one of you can help me. My provider has Pine version 3.91 (I have 
requested they consider upgrading, but right now this is what i have.)

When the system crashes it has more and more been happening that the email
I am working on is not saved in the postponed-messages folder.  Since I am
used to working with computers I am used to saving early and often myself,
but i can not figure out a way I can save the file myself using this
software. Is there a way to do so with this version of Pine? 

Since i sometimes work for over an hour on one piece of email, this is a
very frustrating problem. Any help or suggestions would be greatly
appreciated. 

Thank you
VAL

Dear Pine Group,

Is there a command in pine "setup" that makes it possible to receive a
notice when mail one has sent is actually read
or received by that party??  I did not see one.

Thank you--

Subject: download option in 3.96

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I tried asking this on comp.mail.pine, but haven't got a 
response.

How do I configure the download option of Pine 3.96 for kermit.
I am using a terminal via a telephone hookup to my ISP and want 
to download files direct to the terminal.

When I export an email from pine to MYFILE.txt, exit pine and 
enter 'kermit -s MYFILE.txt' at the UNIX prompt, everything
works OK and the file, MYFILE.txt is downloaded. However when I try 
configuring pine to do it, the temporary file name it chooses, eg
pd026707. is not updated and so previous files I have downloaded in 
the same login session are overwritten. 

At the moment, I have configured the option to read:
kermit -s _FILE_
I also tried adding a -w flag (do not overwrite files), but this 
will not even allow me to download at all.

Will  pine 4 support this citation style or did you do something else?
And if it will, will it have other reply-strings
(i.e. "DMW=Diane... writes")?

Dear Friend(s),
	I would like to know how to change my pine password. When I am in the
main menu I go to setup and pick Newpassword. Then the computer askes me for
my old password. The problem is I don't even remember having an old password.
Is their a way that I can put in a new password without my old password. I
hope I hear from you soon. Thank You!

                                           Sincerely,
                                     Henry St.Charles

That's the login PW for your account.

It's probably in your login script if you dial in.

Or you could pick up a cheap digital clock at a thrift store for about
$3 and set it on top of your monitor...works for me...and it even has
an alarm...just in case I fall asleep in the middle of surfing. rofl

Ahhh  someone with a great sense of humor! :)  What else could we expect
with a name like Shoeless.  But seriously, if a 12 hour clock is too much
trouble I'll settle for a 24 hour one. :)  I'll just wait here at the
puter for someone to write it.

If I could find a good "Pad-Printer" to run my new and outrageously
expensive pad printing machine, I could get back to writing Procmail
recipes, which is what I wanted to do tonight instead of messing with
Illustrator 7 film output, making stupid photopolymer plates, and cycling
this stupid machine for a gazillion hours at a stretch.

It's not RFC-conformant (son-of-RFC-1632 or something...). Heheheee...
Besides, how will pico ever manage yanking that text? Or did you
replace pico too?

It doesn't make much sense the way it is now, does it?

to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the

       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to

the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other

I hope this will be optional; I've never cared for it. Any chance that we'll
have control of quoting levels from messages earlier in the thread?

Sure, if you are installing pc-pine on your single-user machine or Unix pine on
a single-user machine, or if you are system administrator on a multi-user
machine. Just ftp it from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the pine directory.

Wrong! Setting a value in personal-name overrides the full-name token that
would normally be derived from /etc/passwd.

In the portion of the message that you had cut out, he indicated that he really
wanted to changed the mailbox name in the From. FOR THE 2,438,978,542ND TIME,
IT IS A COMPILE-TIME OPTION. BY DEFAULT, YOU CANNOT CHANGE From.

This is the last time this question will ever be asked. Fortunately, thanks to
the changes that Stefan has made to the list, postings will be restricted to
subscribers, and no one will be able to subscribe unless he has filed a
statement saying he has read the FAQs and understands that he will be shot if
he posts one, but before the question is posted.

And, that he will be shot twice if he attempts to ask this one.

Short of compiling it yourself?  Don't think so.  You're at the whim of
your SA (System Administrator).

The feature exists for users who, for security reasons, may only use e-mail and
are never given shell access. It's not applicable to your situation.

Gosh, your system administrator hasn't gotten around to upgrading pine too
recently, has he? Your pine is over 4 years old.

=46rank... Read The Fine FAQ.  Read all the Fine Man pages (do 'man
pine').  If you use a USEFUL SUBJECT for your posts then you'll get
*m/o/r/e* help.  A blank subject gives people no idea _what your
_question is.  Use a subject to Pine list, please.

Read the documentation available either on your system or the pine
website:
		   <http://www.washington.edu/pine>
or get the ps/dvi files from my site:
	       <http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/>

Within pine? Enter the addressbook and read the help there, it's
pretty good.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


I'm the author of a program that allows for easy verification of PGP
signatures for users of Pine. The program is entitled mailPGP. It works
beautifully with Pine 3.95, but when a user is using Pine 3.96, the
display-filter is apparently not being run. 

With the change to Pine 3.96, is there something that needs to be modified
to make display-filters work? Even if I take my .pinerc from pine 3.95 and
encorperate it into Pine 3.96, the display filter is not run.

Thanks,

In Pine 4.00 (not yet released), as it's now, the default reply string can
be based on the sender's initials, but that can also be edited before being
used -- so, for example, Pine would prompt:

	Include original message in Reply (using "DMW> ")?

and one could then, if desired, change that to, say, using "DW>" -- to omit
the middle initial for the reply to this message.

As announced on Mon, 30 Mar 1998, the pine-info mailing list was set to
only accept postings from subscribers yesterday morning (PDT).

Unfortunately, as it turns out, the ListProcessor serving the list is *not*
sending out notification messages to non-subscribers trying to post to the
list which explain that the message was rejected, and how to subscribe to
the list in order to be able to post to it.

Until the reasons for this are understood and overcome, this list has been
set back to again allow postings by non-subscribers (effective 7 Apr 1998
16:06 PDT), since the program-internal help (on the BUG REPORT screen) of
Pine 3.96 and earlier advises users to post a message to this list, and we
don't want that advice to result in messages becoming simply "lost in
cyberspace" (right? ;-).

Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause to list subscribers.

	Dear Sir/ Madam,
			When I receive emails in my 'in' folder, the date
is always wrong. Today being the 8th for example, shows up as the 25th of
April. How do I rectify the situation?
					Regards,

Looking for a way to condense or suppress the recipient list on the messages
I receive. I am part of several distribution lists of 50 - 200 individuals.
It would be better if I didn't see all of those names and have to scroll
through several pages to reach my messages. Any suggestions? (pine 3.94 on
unixware 2.1.1)

There is little that you, the recipient, can do to alter this (apart from
editing your mailbox file -- not recommended).

Instead you should contact the people who send out such messages and ask
them to list the recipients' addresses in the "Bcc:" (Blind Carbon Copy)
header field instead of the "To:" or "Cc:" fields.

If they are indeed still using the ancient v3.94 of Pine they should:

a)  Ensure that at least one e-mail address is given in the "To:" field
    (either their own, or a string ending with the magical ":;" characters,
    such as "Undisclosed recipients:;:

b)  Upgrade to the current version of Pine (3.96), which will do the above
for
    you when sending a message with a blank "To:" field.  [v3.95 and v3.96
    have been out *ages*!]

The reason for putting something in the "To:" field is to stop some
braindead mail delivery systems continuing to reveal the recipients listed
in the "Bcc:" field.  Some do this if they detect a missing or empty "To:"
field, by converting the "Bcc:" list into a series of "Apparently-to:"
headers, thereby filling up each recipient's screen with the list again. 
(Sigh!)

Cheers,

I would appreciate answer to the following question:
How do I set my email account under Pine to UNIVERSALLY forward 
(automatically) any mail received to another mailing address. This is an 
essential function for any mail account holder wo changes his job or goes 
on sabbatical etc'.
Thank y'all!

you're absolutely correct. Nevertheless this is not a feature pine has 
to come up with, because it's part of the mail transfer process.

Create a .forward file in your home directory:

echo "my-new-mail-address" > $HOME/.forward

hth, norbert.

This will do it;
Quit Pine into your home directory, at the command prompt do a:
	$pico .forward (make sure you put the "dot" in there...please.)
This will open a new file named as above. On the first line of the file,
type the new address that you wish mail to be sent to, like this:
	john@somewhere.com (or whatever email address you will want mail to wind
up in) then do a: 
	^O (Control then letter "O") 
	You will be prompted "File to write:.forward?" answer is "Y" for yes, or hit enter. Your file is now saved.
^X (Control "X") Exits you out of that file, and the text editor too, back
to your command prompt.
-----
One caution, what you have just done sends ALL mail to another address, no
copy is kept locally.
-----
When you return from your trip/vacation/sabbatical, to restore things to
the way they were you must shut down the forwarding by either deleting the
.forward file, or emptying it's contents. (Personally I always empty it,
though it wouldn't make a difference)
-----
To empty the .forward file:
At the command prompt:
$pico .forward (opens the file)
with the cursor at the beginning of the one and only line do a:
^K (Control K) that deletes the line of text john@somewhere.com
^O (Control O) saves the file
"Y" (Yes, save .forward please)
^X (Control X, to exit the text editor)
-------
to delete the file, at the command prompt do a:
$rm .forward

Hope this helps, and good luck.
-Colin.

And....in the case of "changing jobs/employers" where an account is
deleted a "nice" system admin may create an "alias" for a given length of
time.  In some systems aliases are defined in /usr/lib/aliases.

I sometimes receive e-mail in German with 'Umlaute'.
These show up on my screen with the warning that it is the "ISO-8859-1"
character set. If I wish to answer how do I switch to this character set?
In MS-WORD the Umlaute are produced by 'control :', but this does not
work on Pine, which is at the UNIX machines of the Astronomy Dept.

You *must be kidding* :-) A *nice* system administrator ... I'd call
this a oxymoron }8-) I've only have to take a look at me ...

But yes, you're right - this would be a good way to handle it and,
well you know, a bribe here, a blackmail there, and things start to
work - ha! charming :-)


cheers, norbert.

This is about the size of charaters.  I have been trying to figure out if
I can increase their size.  I suffer from eye strain whenever I use Pine
since the characters are so small.  Could you please help me since I

Wouldn't that be a feature of the window you have pine in? In an Xterm,
you can set the font size; in a console mode, you can set the font size
with certain programs--which would depend on the OS you use--in PC pine, I
would not know since I do not use it M$ products, but I believe there is a
default setting under the control panel for font sizes.

Hi,

I use procmail to filter my mail into different mailboxes. Is there any
way to make pine look for new mail in different mailboxes and highlight
those mailboxes?

Ed, Colin, and Norbert:

I wish you would all remind everyone that .forward is a particular type of
sendmail alias. While sendmail is a common Mail Transport Agent, it is by no
means universal. It's not done that way with SysVRel4 rmail, as an example.

In fact, I've never heard that other MTA's use it. I believe that .forward is
unique to sendmail. Am I correct?

Gee....I think you just did!  :-)

But, yes, you are correct that "your milage may vary" when it comes to
responses in this and other mailing lists.

Hi Adam,

I fully agree and apologise for the 'fast forward'.

Hmm, so I'll have to stick to the 'go away, look for an appropriate
news group' :-)

You didn't mention which version of Pine you are using nor the platform
(some people seem to persist in using archaic versions!).  However from your
message headers it seems to be 3.96, so...

Go to the Setup Configuration screen and look through for the
"enable-incoming-folders" feature.  Put your cursor on this and type "?" to
see the on-line help about it.

Then turn the feature on and return to the List Folders screen ("L" command)
and set up the names of your additional incoming folders.

Although Pine doesn't automatically poll these for new mail it is very easy
to do a manual check: simply press the Tab key.  This will advance you to
the next New message in the current folder.  When there are no more it will
then offer to search subsequent folders set up in the incoming collection. 
If it finds a folder with new messages it will then offer to let you open it
and view them.  After the last folder Pine offers to return you to the
INBOX.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell

No don't start that...I almost feel as if I can ask a question....and

Yup...you are in fact, dead right. I am appropriately humbled, suitably
reminded, advised, informed, and now in a state of zen-like "hyper
awareness" (without coffee even) on this subject. :)

Your saved-messages folder is entirely different from your INBOX, which is in
/var/mail. So, deleting saved messages will not correct errors in your INBOX.

Immediately beg your system administrator for help before you do additional
needless damage to your account.

Although, how you will read this message, I have no idea.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

I have a question with pine.  I know there's a way to create an alais
using pine.  My problem is when sending mail using the alais list it will
show all the email address that the mail was sent to.  My questiionis is,
is there a way to send mail using an alais without it having it show
everybody address on it?  I want the indiviual receiver to think that
he/she was the only one to receive mail from me.  If this can be done will
you please help me?  If that function is needed to be added please tell me
where this function will go and how can it be added to achieve my goal.

You want to read the documentation for pine, especially the part about 
bcc: (blind carbon copy).

Well, for starters your headers show:

Message-Id: <Pine.3.05.9804101135.B18034-9100000@pnm.my>

I don't recall seeing such an old version of pine in a long time.  Pine is
now at "3.96".  

I suggest the first step is to upgrade!

Second, how large is your "inbox" and your director's sent-mail folder?

It is very likely that it is too large to be handled by the memory of your
Un*x platform.  (BTW, what platform are you on?  Sun, HP?)

Regards,
Ed

Agreed.  An upgrade is definitely in order.

I doubt that Pine is actually running out of memory.  I recall at
least one, and I think there were several, bug(s) that would cause
this that have been fixed since Pine 3.05.  If you can't upgrade right
away, you can try to isolate the trigger by manually editing the
folder and splitting it until you find a message that triggers the
crash.  The most likely cause is a malformed header that is causing
Pine's parser to choke.  I think one problem occurred when a header
ended with a backslash (\) character...

Good luck!

I have set it up on AIX 3.2.5.  Should not be different on 4.2.  It is
essentially a sendmail.cf issue.

Please forward specific questions.

I was thinking more along the lines of SPAM and Monty Python, but pudding
wouldn't be bad either!

Hi.

I'm new to the Pine list and have a question which perhaps someone can
answer:  does some significant portion of the discussion on this group
actually have to do with the Pine program?

So far I've been subscribed for all of one day and seem to have received
about ten messages not regarding Pine, and none at all on topic.

I don't want to sound snooty; it's fine with me if the discussion list is
more of a social thing.  If someone could let me know I would appreciate
it, since I might then save bandwidth and unsubscribe.

Thank you.

-frosty

I think they've all gone mental, waiting for Pine 4.00 to come out.  ;)

it used to be a place to be spammed, asked totally irrelavent questiosn
(how do I legally change my name comes to mind), see questions already
answered in the faq, usually multiple times, flame the clueless, flame the
clued who were acting clueless and occasionally see real discussion about
pine :) 

But recently it was decided that people could only post if they had
subscribed, which apparently has knocked down activities one, two, three
four and five. Activity seven (discussions about spam and pudding) seems
to have moved in to fill the void, though it takes less bandwidth and is
(IMO)  less annoying :) If you'd like to participate in activity six, I'd
suggest that you suggest a topic dealing with pine :)

Folks,

	I am having trouble changing one of the settings for Pine 3.96.  The
setting happens to be the "quit-without-confirm" setting.  I tried to
uncheck it, and said yes to commit the change, but next time I run pine,
when I quit, it just quits without confirming!  Is it a bug?

Nick

I don't believe that you can print through a telnet connection.

An option for you would be to "E"xport your messages, download them to
your win95/dos machine and then print them from there.

I recently got just the information that I need in a message that 
described issues dealing with PINE 3.91 and later operations.  I found 
it in a message that I had to use the V command to read.  Among he 
issues was printing with: attached-to-ansi command/configuration.  Since 
my problem is that I can't print to my desktop printer, I actually lost 
that wonderful information by hitting the wrong file order.  The message 
talked about flow-control problems, and other solutions.  
Do you have it? 

And would you send it to me again?

This is the original request.  I got the answer I needed and lost it 
through misfiling.  Could you send answer again please?

Uh, I do it all the time.  Your telnet must support passthrough printing,
though.  The one that comes with Windows (all versions) is less than
helpful, though (okay - it sucks), and does not permit this.  I prefer
QPC's QVTTerm, but there are several other telnets available, both free-,
share-, and other(?)-ware.  Netterm comes to mind.

On the other hand, we've had trouble printing some messages (typically
from GroupWise) which don't wrap properly;  we've put in place a script,
as an alternative, which opens the printer port and uses 'fold -s' before
sending the stream to the PC, but that doesn't seem to cover all bases.
Anyone else find similar display and printing problems from "foreign"
mail?

Get a different telnet program.  What are you using?

Yes. Oddly enough with a [Spanish?] Mac version of Eudora - took a long
time to work this one out since I couldn't see anything much wrong with
the messages per se. What happens is that Eudora>Eudora and various other
combinations work fine but when this user sends email to other lecturers
and administrative staff in the same School - they use, typically telnet
to the mail system [NCSA telnet on a Mac] and attached-to-ansi to print.
I've tried getting them to change their character set [us-ascii->iso-8859 
etc] but this doesn't seem to help.

NCSA telnet is already set by default to use the multi-national DEC
character set so the display is fine. What happens is that the message
scrolls past on the NCSA window, and that's that. This is with varieties
of Mac from an LCII to a 4400 with 32 megs of memory.

I'm aware that macs are a minority sport, but this isn't half frustrating.
The alternative is cut-and-padte and with long messages this is v.
awkward!

We also have the strange situation where - at certain times and with
certain people on Macs - you get either scrolling to the screen _or_
notification that printing is taking place but nothing happens when
using attached-to-ansi. Sometimes it is possible to narrow this down to a
memory problem or some other anonaly, and rebooting this clears the
problem, but not consistently. Nor do the occurences seem to have any real
common factor. Ouch!

[ Summary ] 
 
How can display-filters be enabled in Pine version 3.96? Adding a trigger
and command line to the display-filters option in the configuration menu
is not working at present.

The following is copied out of my .pinerc file. The '\', as usual, 
signifies a continued line.

display-filters=_LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP")_ /home/dinselj/bin/mailpgp \
RECEIVED _TMPFILE_

[ Timely repost ]

I'm the author of a program that allows for easy verification of PGP
signatures for users of Pine. The program is entitled mailPGP. It works
beautifully with Pine 3.95, but when a user is using Pine 3.96, the
display-filter is apparently not being run.

With the change to Pine 3.96, is there something that needs to be modified
to make display-filters work? Even if I take my .pinerc from pine 3.95 and
encorperate it into Pine 3.96, the display filter is not run.

Thanks,

neat. I'll have to look at that.

I suppose that's what I get for using the tools that come with M$ OSes
(waitaminute..did windows 3.1 come with telnet? blah. whatever :) )

The only thing I use telnet for these days is troubleshooting. Which
brings up an interesting question.hmm.......

Is there any documentation (or better: examples) of the display-filters
feature?  I mean more than that in the online help screens and the
tech-notes files.  I've searched the pine-info archives,
www.washington.edu/pine, dejanews, and a couple of other sites, and the
pickings have been a bit slim.

I'm hoping that setting a display-filter (or more than one) will help
display and print incoming mail from MUAs that insist on sending oddly
formatted messages that either display poorly or print badly (if at all). 
As an example, a message with no newlines (or oddly formatted newlines) in
it will display allright, but print badly.

We are well past my area of expertise, but I'll throw in a question. Why must
display-filters be used at all? It seems that it isn't necessary to use it to
hook in outside programs. Is its purpose to be an option of last resort?

>As an example, a message with no newlines (or oddly formatted newlines) in

Oddly-formatted Newlines, perchance evil quote-printable? You really aren't
looking for a filter, but a method of format conversion to what your printer
really expects.

<whine on>I really don't want to learn all this stuff. I've decided that
everyone is going to agree to use a common standard and stick to it.<whine off>

I have given it all up in favor of another "server" called QVT/Term.
All that "help" was not directed to the user, I found, but to the central 
facility, in this case Hunter College.  The person there said they were 
all tried to no avail.  The "terminal" program is now working well for 
me.  So I use telnet when I don't want to print and Terminal when I do.  
They both get me to my Pine files.

Merely because I feel the need to approach the problem from more than
one direction.

I guess you could say so.

Yup.  Looks that way.

Among other things, but yes - that would suffice for now.

Yeah, me too.  However, that realistically works only when one is higher
on the food chain.  (Hmm, how to say this without getting fired?)  In a
multi-MUA environment, with multiple mail systems loosely tied together
in an Enterprise Message System (tm), some Users are More Equal than
others.  We get to enforce standards and good practices with most
accounts, and then chase our tails for others.

The goal here is to provide smooth interoperability, with a minimum of
fuss.  Anyway, usually the users involved are pretty reasonable;  it's
only when Middle Management gets involved that life gets tense.  <sigh>

Most Pine users find the "Y" command a quick and simple method to print an
e-mail message in Pine.  Is there a similarly quick and simple print
command in Pico?  I haven't found reference to one in the documentation,
although I could easily have missed it.  Thanks, Bill.

We have since moved mail off of our main computer , and now pine users must
use pine with Imap, I have setup  a conf file so that all pine users
default to the Imap server.

The problem is there are some email messages that case pine to crash with
the following:



[Not a string: ("TEXT" "html" ("CHARSET" "iso-8859-1") NIL NIL
"QUOTED-PRINTABL]


Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
Pine Exiting.
Abort (core dumped)

And they can not read it and I have no idea how to fix this..  I am
assumung from the above that the message is in HTML format

Can anyone help me shed some light on this before our users lynch me to the
nearest tree :)

Check your metamail setup, especially /etc/mailcap or whichever
mailcap you're using.

Subject: toggling between editors when ^_ doesn't work

How do I map the ^_ (Ctrl Shift -) key to toggle between default
and alternate editors in Pine 3.96?

I am using an apparently vt-220 terminal to type files
offline, which I then upload via a telephone hookup to my ISP 
in pine with the upload option. I then edit them with vim 
in pine before sending them. 

The terminal does not transmit codes for ctrl-shift combinations. I tried
it in vim in insert mode, first typing ^V and then ^_ but nothing appeared
on the screen. 

I need to be able to toggle between the default editor and alternate
editor, because I want to use ^R, then ^Y to upload the files and this 
means I have to access the default editor (PICO). In vim, these keys 
are used for other functions.

Can't advise you; I don't know what comm program you use.

If you are offline, why do you emulate any terminal at all? Why don't you use
DOS or Windows applications available to you?

>The terminal does not transmit codes for ctrl-shift combinations. I tried

You sure you are emulating vt-220? You have this set in your .profile or .login
as well in your home directory on the remote computer?

>I need to be able to toggle between the default editor and alternate

Fortunately, there's a work-around when your terminal emulation eats control
key combinations. [esc][esc]<key> is equivalent to [control]<key>.

Your life would probably be easier if you performed the upload outside of pine
with ZMODEM, and then read the file into the composer from your home directory.

Thanks to Adam H. Kerman <ahk@chinet.chinet.com>
for the help with the terminal emulation which eats 
control-shift combinations. <esc><esc><key> works for
me instead of <Ctrl-key>. 

Just to elucidate the terminal I am working with, it is a HiTEL 
terminal distributed free by the Korean Telecom telephone company,
not an IBM-compatible PC. I think it is modeled on the French Minitel.
It has a rudimentary wordprocessing facility off-line. I doubt the 
hardware transmits the control-shift combinations.

I like the upload and download options in Pine because it is quicker 
and I don't have to clean up my home directory afterwards. I also 
like vi so I'm glad I can now use them both from this terminal.

Thanks again.

Hi,

I've tried to compile and run pine 3.96 on HP-UX 10.20. The compilation
was clear and it's possible to run pine.
...BUT ...
When I run the command pine and try to compose new message ( 1-st time
after running command pine) and when going to line "Subject", in the
bottom line appears label "[still rebuilding </>]" (with rotating slash)
and cursor is moved to the beggining of that line. So next typed chars
are written to the bottom line (tried on three different types of
terminals).  
 
If I send message it will be sent properly. And next composing of
message is without label "[still rebuilding </>]" and it's OK.

Have anyone had the same problem ?

                Thanks, Miro.

If this problem only occurs when the user "root" is trying to compose the
message, that would be the result of bug in the addressbook update code. 

Attached to this message, you will find a patch that Steve Hubert of the
Pine Development Team posted last year, which fixes the problem nicely. 
Apply the patch, rebuild Pine and you should be in business! 

Best regards,

I wonder if anyone knows how to unsubscribe to pine-info.
I am used to having that listed at the end of messages, and all my 
attempts have failed.  I seem not to know to whom my request should be 
addressed.

Aargh! Why the hell isn't administrivia turned on? All messages like this
should be bounced to the list owner. Typically, administrivia looks for words
that look like commands in the Subject and first 10 lines of the body.

I've exposed the full headers from your message. This is what you do to figure
out what list server runs a list.

>Return-Path: <PINE-INFO-owner@u.washington.edu>
>Sender: PINE-INFO-owner@u.washington.edu

These 2 lines are an alias for a person, the list owner. If you have trouble
with commands, send a message to this person.

>X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

This tells you that the server is ListProc. So, send a message

To: listproc@u.washington.edu

[leave Subject blank]

signoff [or unsubscribe] pine-info [the e-mail address you subscribed under]

[delete any .sig]

Other common servers are Majordomo and LISTSERV. The procedure is generally
similar. Sometimes on ListProc and LISTSERV lists you MUST use signoff rather
than unsubscribe. Signoff was the traditional command, and they sometimes
forget to alias unsubscribe to it.

Generally the alias for the list owner is owner-[listname], except pine-info
uses [listname]-owner, which is nonstandard.

Ok, I've had enough of this. Heheheee... AFAIK, there's no central
page collecting valuable tips like this[1] so I've launched one:

	<http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/pine-tips.html>

If you've got something you think is cool and deserves going down in
history and don't have your own webspace or know fsck all about HTML
or simply are too lazy to bother converting that stuff, throw it my
way and it will be included. Things I feel might be cool:

    o Random signatures 
    o Fancy Mailcap entries 
    o Good sending filters (escpecially the pgp stuff)
    o Patches like the one fixing... well, cool patches, y'know? 
    o Screenshots with scantily clad females using pine

Also, a simple .procmailrc (mine is cluttered across 23 files and
weighs some 370k[2]) would be rad. Or wouldn't it? Dunno...

A small note about the colours... If you think they suck, take a *really*
close look in the mirror before saying it. And read the warning sign on
my entry page... Ya know, it's a men's world after all - only wussies use
Netrape or Intranet Exploder. Duuuuuuuhhhhhh...

God, I'm bored.

Robin

Footnotes: 
[1]  Probably, the Pine site is full of it and I look a complete jerk
     now, but what the heck...

[2]  No, I will not make it publicly available, don't bother...

    My version of PINE went through an auto-upgrade and now I 

 cannot see any of my old folders.

I have it pointed to the right path and I can use GOTO FOLDER to
see the actual information.

It just doesn't show up normally, though.

Any suggestions?

wouldn't it be better to add it to the bottom..that seems to be the
standard, anyway.

It would make it much easier on the eyes, I tell you.

I agree, but there appears to be no configuration to append "constant" text
to each posting with ListProc.  I have checked with our ListProc caretakers
to see whether there is a way, and in that case will definitely move the
text to the bottom.  (For now, I've made it shorter.)

***********************************************************************

The electronic mailing list Pine-Info covers features, bugs & workarounds,
usage, installation, customization and more pertaining to the Pine
software.  While unmoderated, it is intended primarily for discussion of
matters of interest to systems/email administrators, developers, trainers,
user support personnel, and others involved with Pine messaging on a
"technical" level.  

Posting to the list requires subscription to the list.  For more
information about the list, and its archives (including a searchable
index), see: http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/

Questions or comments regarding administration of the list can be sent to:  
owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu (questions about other subjects than the
mailing list, such as about the Pine software, sent to this address WILL
NOT be answered).

End-user questions should be directed to the newsgroup comp.mail.pine
rather than the mailing list. 

If you are ONLY interested in announcements regarding Pine from the Pine
development team at the University of Washington, you may wish to subscribe
to the Pine-Announce list (rather than to Pine-Info); see: 
http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/pine-announce.html

General information about Pine is available from:

I'd put those in <> to make them browsable.

I just put another lynx-from-within pine script up on the tips
page. Anyone got a random-sig script and a well set up mailcap?

I just had this other weird idea, dunno if it's any good - how about
an htmlized .pinerc with links to the respective help files. Should be
a cakewalk but I'm not sure anyone sees any real need for that...

Later,
Robin

Missed it. Thanks Stefan for making the owner-pine-info alias point to you!

Hm, with the information straddling more than one line, it makes it difficult
for me to reply to the list. Typically, I "reply to all", cut the To, cut the
Cc (pine-info, in this case), move cursor to To, and uncut so that pine-info's
on the To.

I can't do that anymore.

I see what you mean -- and I see no way of keeping it to one line with the
URL included.  This was intended to be helpful to guide people lost for
information on how to unsubscribe etc. to the right place, since ListProc
doesn't (yet?) provide for appending that to postings, but it sounds like
it creates more problems than it solves.  Opinions from other list members?

pine is an e-mail reader. Read about it on the Web at
http://www.washington.edu/pine/

I don't know what you mean by "on line directly".

Not good I'd say. Put that stuff in the footer. Something like:

--
       PLEASE read the Pine FAQ and the MAILING LIST ARCHIVES!
	  LIST: http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/???
	  FAQ: http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/???
    To unsubscribe: send mail to listinfo-owner@cac.washington.edu
	       with "unsubscribe" in the message body.

Mind the sigdashes ;-) BTW, your quoting stuff is not son-of-RFC-1632
conformant or something. Even SuperCite cannot handle it. Can pico?
Just kidding...

Ummm... Welcome to the 90s, Stefan of Borg. You know, there's this
thing called "WWW". It's got KeWL pixxx and stuff, and people like to
go there with their MUAs. Therefore some kind people did this:
   <http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/pine-tips.html#lynxspawn>
and this:
  <http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/pine-tips.html#pine-lynx.pl>
so that pine can fire up lynx. Actually, the latter would get along
fine without the brackets, but it's better style to have them, I
guess.

Later,
Robin

No. Go away.

The purpose of this mailing list is to discuss pine, an e-mail reader and news
reader. We can't help you find lost cats, psychicly answer questions about your
local system, direct you to other systems, etc.

We don't know where you live, or whom to direct you to. Did it ever occur to
you to ask your system administrator how to gain access to news? Or, ask
another user of news what system he uses?

>From your Message-ID, you aren't even a pine user.

I removed my name from this list a long time ago and now it seems I am
back.  Please remove me if you can.

If I have inadvertenly sent this message to the wrong address,DO NOT
FLAME ME!!!  I don't have time for any of the pettiness that seems to
be rampant with this newsgroup (*news* said lightly).

If I need to send this to another address please be adult and simply
give me the correct address.

Thanks!

It was a short-lived experiment: This mailing list's To: header now no
longer bears the URL for the Web page about the list.  When we upgrade to
ListProc 8.2, it will be (according to the release notes for that version,
anyway ;-) possible to append a footer to each posting that will then
contain information about how to unsubscribe, the URL, ...

No it's not. Dammit. It sucks. However, pine could be delivered with
some headers enabled, say: "X-URL:..." That way, more people would
visit my website. Ummm... ok, the pine website, too.

Colin, not all newbies are totally clueless. The first message they
get will say what that mail said, and that's cool. No need to have me
hack my .Gnus to filter this stuff. What's that "about:" got to do
there, anyway?

Hello, Pine team: Why doesn't pine come with a texi or SGML refcard/
FAQ/User-Something? That would rock. Admins could print it out and give
people. I still volunteer for that (at least SGML, not necessarily
texi).

> Spawn lynx????  

I don't care. Make it a switch. Spawn *something" that reads HTML. More
and more people are using this crap, anyway. The cleanest solution,
IMO, is what Gnus does, namely washing the mails. Then again, XEmacs
has W3 built in, so... Who's got a procmail script that washes HTML
from the body? I want that on the tips page.

As I said - make it a switch. I still imagine putting together 3 or 4
sample-pinerc in /etc/skel or something and make them do stuff, like
"html-washing-pinerc" or "imap-pinerc" or whatever.

*kick* But you're right. Recent versions even do tables.

Somehow, I get this weird feeling that you must have sucked big time
when you were a newbie. Hehehee...

> Subject: "Something happened to my screen" 

You're probably right, but I still remember hacking away at my pinerc
for hours only to find Yet Another Switch. Some things are *really*
strangely labelled (aggregate commands???).

> I don't think we wanna go there. :-) Now...What was the question????

Why haven't you contributed to the Tips page?

Have a nice weekend.

This is the error we recieve when running Pine 3.96 on HP-UX 10.10

[error sending:553 local config error, hostname not recognized as lo]

Can anyone offer help on this one?

Our /usr/local/lib/pine.conf worked fine until today.  I don't see anything
that looks out of the ordinary...but...

If I disable the pine.conf my .pinerc file runs it just fine.

TIA

Mike.................

Pine 4 doesn't need the <> to find the hyperlink and I think it just
clutters up the text.  If Netscrape or Internet Exploder needs the <>,
I would say that's reason enough not to put them in ;-)

I do, but I still want to clean it up a bit before posting it again.
Search the archives if you really want it...

I started looking into doing that before I left the Pine Team, but
never got very far with it.  Once they get the help text converted to
HTML it'll be alot easier.

I've had much success with BetterTelnet, based on the original NCSA source
and enhanced/fixed in many ways. I highly reccomend it over the original
NCSA.
<http://www.cstone.net/~rbraun/mac/telnet/>

Also, I've not had much luck getting ZTerm to like passthrough printing,
but found a shareware backage as same price as Zterm, called Black Knight
(I think) that handles passthrough printing well.

good luck,

Hi,

I downloaded pine_3.96L-7. When I want to build it with the command ``build
lnx'', I get output on STDERR as you can see at the bottom of this posting.

I've read the FAQ and searched the archives, but still haven't got a clue on
how to obtain my binaries. Does anyone over here have?

				Thanks,

					Bye,

My ISP mirrors my test-mails as attachment in MIME messages 
(message/rfc822). I cannot see all mirrored headers of my original mail
in the attachment which the mirror produces.

I believe that pine (version 3.95) eats some headers imbedded in the
attachment. This is not good.

Any comments? 

Regards,
Rudolf

Dear All,
 
Do you know if PINE supports the requesting of and (meaningful) display of
Internet "Delivery Status Notification"s, a.k.a. NOTARY, a.k.a Delivery
Reports, a.k.a. RFC1891->RFC1894?
 
Early tests suggest it displays as text (which is OK, but not ideal) a
message/delivery-status and I can't see any hooks to allow it to set the
request flag. [This is with pine 3.96]. 
 
I couldn't see a mention of this planned for pine 4.00 - anyone else have
any info?
 
 
If not, where is the best place/list to go to get involved in Pine
development?  :-) 
 
 
regards,
 
jb

Pine 4.00 will be able to make DSN requests, but it won't do much in
the way of handling the reports (unless someone's done alot of coding
in the last couple months ;-)  It's so rare to find a complete
delivery path that supports DSN now that it's a bit hard to test too.  

> If not, where is the best place/list to go to get involved in Pine
> development?  :-) 

This is the place to start.  There is a pre-release list of people who
will get a copy of Pine shortly before the public release to iron out
port-specific bugs they can't test directly.  The Pine Team usually
likes to see some demonstrated familiarity with building and patching
Pine before they put you on that list though.  Requests to get on the
list should go to pine@cac.washington.edu.  (Tip:  make sure the
subject: of your message make it clear what you want;  the Pine Team
often doesn't read messages that don't stand out...) 

Good luck!

Subject: Trouble logging on to UNIX host to access remote INBOX from PC-pine
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I am having trouble logging onto my remote UNIX computer, where my
inbox is located.  I am trying to set up PC-pine but I am unable to access
any remote folders on my remote unix.  If you could be of any help, with
suggestions, or ANY ideas, please respond.  I would like to resolve this
issue.


Thanks,
   Jared
