I have a request for the developers out there: I've observed that when
PCPine (3.96) tries to connect to its IMAP server and gets a slow
connection, it ties up my entire machine (Windows 95, and unfortunately
upgrading to NT may not be an option). In other words, I can't use other
applications while waiting for that server response. I'm assuming, of
course, that I'm not missing some configuration option :)

Is there any chance of getting this fixed in a future release?

The behavior of attempting to connect to a slow server is the same on NT or Unix
Pine, for that matter. I agree that it's annoying not to be able to run such a
process in background.

It hangs your entire Unix machine?  That is what the original author wrote about
a Win95 box, and I highly doubt that Unix Pine connecting to a IMAP server 
hangs the entire machine.  It certainly will hang your Pine session, of course.

I did grow tired of waiting for Pine's "status updating" to complete--pine
would suddenly freeze in the middle of reading a message, and usually when 
I wanted to go to the next page :)  But I moved my mailbox to a different server
and shrunk it down... now the wait is shorter so I don't care.  

I wonder if there is a way to make that update asynchronous--it seems
like a fair trade off to make the inbox "(READONLY)" while the update is 
occurring, but I suppose you would either need to make Pine multithreaded,
and have that mess of different platforms, or fork another Pine process and
use shared memory... and have that mess of different platforms.

So it doesn't surprise me that it hasn't been done yet :)

It seemed like a good idea, at the time.

I'd definitely settle for being able to use other applications while
PCpine works. Unix users should already be able to do this by hopping to
another window. (Notice I'm assuming everyone uses X. This is probably a
faulty assumption, but there you go :)

I know this has been discussed before, but I suck and didn't save the
info. I tried searching the archived message database, but I only came up
with one of robin's .sigs. And Robin's page is down.

So I ask the stupid, FAQ which is not in the FAQ

Are we getting killfiles? Do we already have killfiles (I was told by
someone that pine does, but having read through the helpfiles and the man
page more times than I want to know, I'm sure I would have noticed) and we
just don't know it? When?

There is an FAQ describing how to use the killfile features of rn-style
newsreaders (trn, slrn, etc.) in batch-processing mode. This'll mark messages
accordingly in your .newsrc. Then, you can read news with pine.

It's posted to news.software.readers. Or get it from http://www.faq.org/ or ftp
it from rtfm.mit.edu.

I had the same problem and I changed these lines in my pinerc file.
The folder colloection line I added 143 (the port that most imap servers
run on). Then changed the rsh timeout to 0 (pine tries to connect via rsh
first). after that I haven't noticed any lag.

I'd definitely settle for being able to use other applications while
PCpine works. Unix users should already be able to do this by hopping to
another window. (Notice I'm assuming everyone uses X. This is probably a
faulty assumption, but there you go :)

Subject: Pine---> Netscape transition
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi --

I have some customers who are currently reading mail using Pine. We 
need to move them to a Netscape Messaging server environment. Does
anyone have experience moving the directories where users have filed
their mail when using Pine to the Netscape environment without disturbing
the directory structure. i.e., keep it transparent to the users?

Pine is in a SunOS environment and NS Messaging server is Solaris.

thanks in advance for help or pointers to help.

I move back and forth between OINE and NETSCAPE MESSENGER transparently
all the time (I prefer Pine but Netscape gives me threading and hot
links). Both save their mail "folders" as plain text files. As long as
you set the Netscape local (or server if you are using IMAP) path to the
same location as the PINE folders you should be OK.

This is helpful but I have additional questions. (note that I am not a sys
admin ... so may not phrase things correctly) Anyway, we are moving
all the users from one machine where they read mail in the Pine environment, to
another machine where Messaging svr is running. I suppose each (pine and mess
svr) have their own directory place to plop down the user directories. I
figured if one could just copy from one machine to the other and put them in
the correct place all would be well. Does this make sense? In the new
environment, the users will be a mix of POP3 with a variety of clients and
IMAP4 using Communicator.

Thanks for your response. - pat

I tried this and saw no difference. Maybe it depends on your local network
setup?

I think that "Kanipso" failed to realize that you were using PCPine.
At least, I don't believe that PC's use "rsh" to do anything, not unless
you've set up some funky cygwin32-opennt thing.

I agree that it sucks that you can't do anything else while it is connecting,
but I'm no crack dos/windoze programmer so I can't help you much.   Run
Linux?  :-)

Come on folks, the announcement was made THREE months ago that ``Development  
of Pine 4.00 is nearing completion''

An email was sent to the PINE-announce list, and a webpage was started.

Then three months of "Real Soon Now" to break up the otherwise defeaning silence.

No followup messages, the web page hasn't changed since it went live.

Is this thing coming out within the next month or not?

Hi!

Does anybody know/can anyone remember whether Pine 4.00 will have proper
threading for reading Usenet News (as against the current Ordered Subject
approximation)?

I've checked the Pine 4.00 Preview page at the Pine Information Centre but
threading isn't mentioned (as far as I can see) one way or the other.

Cheers,

Mike B-)

I'd rather have it order mail messages where In-Reply-To headers exist. If they
don't, I'd like to have the ability to select additional messages while I'm
reading, not just from the Index screen.

Call me evil, call me what you will, but I wrote a patch a while
back to use vi-style key bindings, primarily just so that j/k
would duplicate n/p.

I wrote it as a new 'feature' called enable-vi-keys and it seems
to work quite well.  I wanted to actually change the behavior of
the global key input function, but it didn't have access to the
"state" variable so I just hacked it in all the different modules
I wanted it to work in.

I was a long time Elm user, and I've used this feature to convert
a number of others... what are the chances that something like this
could be worked into the production tree?

I'm willing to rewrite my patches in a way that changes fewer
files, but again it seemed to require too great a change to
read_char() in ttyin.c.

Instead, I chose to add sections of code like:

    if(F_ON(F_ENABLE_VI_KEYS,state)) {
        if (command == 'j')
            command = 'n';
        else if (command == 'k')
            command = 'p';
    }

To places where I wanted to circumvent Pine's regular
keystrokes with vi-style ones.  Surprisingly, the main menu
is the only place with significant conflicts (that I could tell).
Sure, the index has "j" for jump by default, but if you're
an Elm user you'll just want to type the number anyway.

Did I miss an address for patches?  Or does the development
team like to keep code changes to within their castle?  In
any event, my patches are just a trivial but nice addition to 
a fine program.

Call me silly, replying to my own email.

Shortly after I sent this message, I went back to the source
to examine it again.  If I had been more patient I wouldn't
have sent the message.

My original patchset modified 
	addrbook.c
	folder.c
	init.c
	mailcmd.c
	mailindx.c
	other.c
	pine.h

Now I only modify
	init.c		(one line added)
	ttyin.c		(six lines added)
	pine.h		(one line added, one line changed)

The only difference is that the original patchset allowed 
j/k to be used at any time, except in the folder index where
it would check the state.  Now the only problem is that
j/k are now always replaced with n/p, even when inputing
text.  Bummer :)

If anyone is interested in this sort of thing, let me know.
These sort of vi-key bindings really get user-interface messy
on the "MAIN MENU" screen where you have J)ournal and K)eyboard
lock.  But everywhere else, it's no problem.

The last time I worked on it, I just didn't let vi keys work
on the main menu, since I always pick the letter away.

Blah.  That's enough out of me for tonight.

I got an e-mail where the 'To:' entry was missing the domain (see below).
Pine simply added my own default domain when displaying the simple header.
The resulting 'To:' address is simply wrong.
Why doesn't pine use the 'X-To:' entry? (see full header below)

Cheers,

Yes, you are evil if you bring *anything* from that accursed pox-ridden
son of Beelzebub called vi

Now I am definitely in awe. Anyone who can write "features" just acquired

Er, OK I guess. Hacking *anything* in a mail program is an accomplishment.
You have just become elevated to "Deity" status. I am not only in awe, now
I'm afraid, very afraid.

At the risk of seeming somewhat small minded here (I am, I like Pine a

I cannot speak for my superhero Stefan, and his band of caped crusaders

that any arcane vi attribute will *ever* find it's way into the king of
all mail programs.

> my patches are just a trivial but nice addition to

Edan, lest you think I'm just lashing out in a fit of blind bigotry, I'm
*not*
The fact that you know enough to write patches to a mail program is
awesome in my mind (and I'm *not* kidding, believe me) but here's the
point as I see it.
Pine represents a step forward, from it's first iteration onwards to this
version which is "about as good as it gets". It's intuitive, it just
"knows" what users want to do (or it's development team do anyway). Elm is
about the most infuriating mail program you could ever find. It 'aint
intuitive, it's kludgy, and it's learning curve sucks.
vi blows dead monkeys period. You couldn't ask for a more obscure editor
than vi. It's quirky, and requires a thought process that could best be
described as "lateral" in order to use it properly. Why would you want to
import features from packages like that I wonder?
Pine and pico have on-screen help that allows some real new folks to get
up and running in a heartbeat, and is sufficiently powerful to allow
sophisticated users to process huge amounts of mail rapidly and
efficiently.
When you think "obscure" most people think of emacs...nosir, vi takes the
first prize. Emacs is at least a gift from the gods in that it has "power"
to do amazing things. (ask Robin)
Nononono, if you want a text editor that the average person can use,
quickly and effectively, Pico is the way to go. If you want real power,
learn emacs.
Gawd, why do I always rise to the bait?
Edan, I salute you for the try...really. Spend those awesome talents on
worthwhile projects.
I'm going to lubricate my Pelican now, he looks kinda hungry.

"Conversations devolve to 'vi' for much the same reason that small
children eventually start discussing excrement.  As disgusting as it
is, there is a horrid fascination with it." (Joseph M. Newcomer)

I don't quite agree. There is much elegance in vi's movement
keymapping. tin has nice movement keybindings, too. Pine does
not. YMMV.

Not in my opinion. There are some minor but quite annoying quirks in
pine's initial behaviour, e.g. the signature thing and pico's utterly
braindead yanking behaviour.

That is not entirely correct. vi (and vim in particular) is a very,
very good editor. It's certainly not "user friendly", but which good
program is?

Because it's fast and efficient.

Not. High volume mailing lists soon bring pine to a grinding halt and
pico is an abomination.[1] Unless you throw in procmail and vi or jed,
pine is quite unusable for larger amounts of mail. I get about 500
mails a day, and without Gnus, I would spend half my time writing
weighted score rules for procmail. Before I switched to Gnus, I had
about 900k of procmail code.

Good boy.

Ummm... nope. You always have to take into account that XEmacs is a
monster when it comes to sucking up resources.

And that's without MULE and my personal elisp dir. Nope, you cannot

mcedit, fte, joe (jmacs, jstar), jed... There are many that are about
as big and much more powerful. I find mcedit (Midnight Commander's
editor) a very interesting alternative in that it much behaves like

So... pine and jed would make a wonderful pair, especially since jed

Colin, you don't understand. "j and k" are used because of the arcane nature of
the keyboard we use, left to us from the original machine put together from
gears and levers attached to individual pieces of type. The gears and levers
didn't retract quickly enough in the original model, so a keyboard was designed
partly out of a desire to slow down users and partly to fit the type in.

Subsequent generations of typewriters solved that problem, actually within a
year or two. But, they reused the same key order. (There were other keyboards in
use, such as on a Monotype machine, operated entirely with the left hand! while
the right hand threw the levers that cast the type. Another keyboard, invented
by an Army technician during the WWII who claimed that a different arrangement
of the keys could speed up typing. After all, wars cannot be fought without
properly processing the paperwork. But, historians have proven that Mr. Dvorak
falsifyed his studies. QWERTY order will always be on keyboards.)

vi uses "j" and "k" because they are next to each other on the keyboard! Which
is a damn good reason to use them. Terminals are still in use today that don't
have arrows, or with arrow keys with different key codes.

And, most keyboards stick the arrows in uncomfortable locations.

"n" and "p" have only a vague advantage over arrows on some keyboards. But, "j"
and "k" have a clear advantage.

pine really doesn't use neumonics for key bindings. Yes, "j" stands for "jump",
but that's a silly thing to call a command.

"k" isn't used in the index or the message pager. In the composer, it stands for
"kut" so ^c could be used for "cancel".

>I don't quite agree. There is much elegance in vi's movement keymapping. tin

You start using vi (well, vim really these days) and your fingers learn the
commands. It does follow a design which becomes clear AFTER you get used to it.
It really doesn't take that long.

That's leftover from slow modem days. It's a helpful feature at 1200 or 2400.

Robin, who would want to use pine for use with large lists?

How on earth do people receive that much mail? If I'm on a talky list that I
don't keep up with, I trash it.

Heh. On DOS, I still use PC-Write, written by an ex-WordStar encoder.

I agree wholeheartedly.  I prefer j/k over n/p because it allows my
fingers to remain on the home row and doesn't feel like it will lead to
a repetitive motion injury.  There's that, and the fact that I'm using
vi right now.

In fact, it was Pine's enable-alt-editor-implicity feature that 
helped cement my transition to it from Elm.  With Pine, in most 
cases I could now go from folder index to message editor just by hitting 'r'
and you have to love that.

I'm a Pine Evangelist around here.  My vi-keys patch is part of how I
lure hardened Elm users away.  Frankly, I find Pine without j/k
kind of lame now.  Did I mention I was using vi right now?

I've got my patch down to three files, so that 

	'j' -> 'n'
	'k' -> 'p'		
	'/' -> 'w'

The only conflict I'm aware of is the main menu.  I haven't
decided how to resolve it.  You end up losing (J)ournal which I think
is a useful function occassionally.  You also lose (K)eyboard lock,
but I don't really care :)
 
I also presume that if you want vi keys, you don't use the builtin pico.

A full-blown vi mode, where you can hit Esc and use vi editing 
commands in parts of pine where you edit text... is definitely not
planned.   >:)

I'm not going to get into a editor religious war, suffice to say
that I use vi because it's powerful and nasty and isn't a 20MB
binary.  My pine patch is fairly inocuous and obvious is nature;
I just wondered if anyone in the Pine community would be interested.

- edan


p.s.  Patching read_command instead of read_char was much smarter. :)

OK Adam, Edan, here it is....
I'm basically stupid, lazy (or maybe too damn busy) to learn that beast
called vi. In the light of what Edan wrote, I fired up vi on Saturday
night, and actually read the book while playing with the thing.
Yeah, OK I see what you and he are saying.
Y'see, one of the effects of being so stupid is that it makes a person
very self-righteous in support of the "easy solution".
However.....somewhere along the way I thought things were supposed to be
as simple as possible.
You, Edan, Robin and many others are so far ahead of me it's ridiculous. I
guess editors that are more powerful are more appropriate when you're
doing advanced stuff. (ask Robin I guess)
*But* I *do* believe that an editor that you can use in any condition (and
that certainly applies to me) with immediate and predictable reults is the
one you stick with until you (or the editor) run outta steam. Same goes
for Elm I s'pose.
Believe it or not Adam, *that's* what I was getting at.
I'm just plain in awe of Edan and folks like him who can write C (to start
with) and can modify a mail programs' feature-set.
Well, that's my .02 worth for today...maybe.
-Colin.

Edan,

AAAAAAARRRGGGHHHHHH! (You *had to* didn't you?) :-)
> Did I mention I was using vi right now?

Well, *now* you're talking...yup, that's true, no question. vi is lean 'an
mean.

I say again (already said on the post to Adam) that I'm in awe of anyone
who can;
	a) write C
	b) write (or modify) feature-sets for a mail program
Yes, the patches *are* innocuous..absolutely.
> My pine patch is fairly inocuous and obvious is nature;
> I just wondered if anyone in the Pine community would be interested.
I wonder what Stefan thinks?
This list got real quiet suddenly :-) It's almost as though the spectators
became hushed, awaiting the spectacle of combat in the arena below :)
hahahaha!
I wasn't flaming you, I hope you realize that.
Later oh guru of C

The "/" drives me nuts. That's such a common way to invoke searches in pagers
and editors. I always hit it first; the error message reminds me of "w".

I wish pine would implicitly enable alternate pagers, which would solve some of
the problems. I'd use less.

Hello!

I was wondering if there was anyway within Unix pine to alter the From:
header.  I have one of those nifty "free e-mail redirection for life"
accounts and I was hoping to set up my outgoing mail to show up from that
address instead of from my actual address.

I'm not terribly concerned about people reading mail headers.  I just want
the default reply to be to the "redirector" address.  I know, I know..
"Reply-To:".  Except that most of the mailing lists I'm on alter Reply-To:
to reply to the list.

Any help would be appreciated.

It's about as addictive as Emacs. Wait till you get to the syntax

pico is not easy. You'll lose much more time adjusting paragraphs and
lines than you'd spend on reading the vi or jed FM.

What's "advanced"? I use XEmacs and that's not really an editor but a
programming environment. vi or jed, however, are really easy to learn
(once you find out how to start with the help menu on) and simple
things like yanking in complex quotes or quickly requoting reginons is
a pretty cool thing if you do a lot of mail/news.

Ever tried mutt with vi? Cool stuff - threaded, coloured, killing,
PGP, blablabla. Ummm... and there's Gnus. Heheee...

>Yes, it's in the FAQ

I, for one, intend to ignore this question in the future, and any other FAQ that
gets asked so repetitively. We don't help anyone who can't trouble himself to
read the FAQs.

Especially, those who can't even bother to use a Subject.

They aren't even worth insulting. Delete 'em like spam.

I have looked, and, with some timidity because of asking a frequently
asked question, still I want to know how to jump to the end of a long
message in pine.
Hopefully I won't get my head bitten off for asking this.

  Help!  Until recently I had no problem printing a message in pine; I
 would simply type "y" and my printer would print out the current  message
 or whatever else then appearing on my screen.  I recently
 had some problems with my modem and internet service, etc. after I
 installed MS Internet-Explorer program (figures), and now have finally
 gotten most of the bugs out...However, when I hit "y" in pine, my (H-P
 682) printer churns and makes all the usual noises and prep. motions, but
 then nothing happens (yet the printer works fine in other applications...)
 Any ideas?  I'm stuck, even tried re-installing my communications/modem
 software (Bitcom in DOS), but same problem...Help!   Thanks.

Subject: PCPine and Fetchmail?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7BIT
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I know this is a somewhat hare-brained scheme, but I am 
increasingly frustrated with other mail clients, and I really 
want to be able to use pine at work.  I've appended an 
explanation of why I want to do this at the end.

Our mail server does not run an IMAP server, but I would like to 
be able to use PCPine.  What I would like to do is run a program 
such as fetchmail on my pc so that it downloads the mail which I 
would then read with pine just as if this were a dial-up 
connected linux box or the like.  I haven't been able to find a 
PC analog of fetchmail, but I'm willing to try the port if 
there's some hope of this working.  The immediate problem I see, 
however, is that PCPine will not read from an inbox on the local 
computer, even if one is there.  It only speaks IMAP.  So, my 
questions are as follows:

Will PCPine 4.0 be able to read from an inbox on the local 
machine like unix-pine does?

Is there some reason that I haven't foreseen why running a 
fetchmail sort of program on a PC won't work?

The reasons I have decided that this is about my only option are 
as follows:

1. In 10 years of using email with MUAs ranging from unix-mail 
to Netscape, I have never found a client that I like as well as 
pine.

2. My office computer is owned by my employer, so running linux 
on it is not an option.

3. Our mail server is SERIOUSLY overloaded.  Even pop 
connections are slow.  When I am logged in and try to use Pine 
on the server, there is often not enough free core to fork an 
editor.  On some occasions there is not even enough memory for 
me to start unix mail, let alone pine.  Given these constraints, 
requests to run an IMAP server are hopeless, and perpetually 
open POP connections are not likely to perform well, either.

Thanks,
Brian

I am a blind pine user and some of my friends and I are wondering if there
is a command to jump from one word to the next without having to use the
^w and searching for the next space.
For instance, in most editers, control right arrow or left arrow will jump
to previous or next word.
Is this possible in pine?
Steve

Is there any way to edit a mail file I have received in PINE before
printing it or saving it?  Sometimes I would like to fix up the
formatting, get rid of leading >>, etc. 

The only ways I have come up with are to export it to a file or mail it to
myself (editing it before sending it).

Also, can I delete an attachment before saving a received mail file?

control-space

However, I've yet to see a telnet or terminal emulation that doesn't trap this.
So, you may have to use the workaround

escape-escape-space

No. I recommend saving it to a temporary mail folder, exiting pine, and then
editing the file. Then, in pine, save it to a permanent folder.

>Also, can I delete an attachment before saving a received mail file?

No. Edit as above. Others will recommend using postponed-msgs and then editing
in the composer. However, this will change most of the headers, so I don't care
for this method.

   I am using the beta of secure CRT right now, (2.2b4) from vandyke- and
control-space works great. ($term=vt220) Never knew this- it's pretty
usefull to me, even though I can see fine. ;)

Hi!

I'm System Administrator, and this week I was configuring pine,
but, I want the users can't save files in disk, but, I don't
know how to do it.
Do you know if there is a compile way to avoid the users can't
save files in disk and not use espace?

I hope you can helpme

Thanks in Advanced

p.d. I'm sorry but, my english is poor.

   Also, am using the 2.7b version of NCSA telnet for the mac, it's
emulation also handles the control-space character for jumping to the next
word. So, that means I'm 2-for-2 on emulations I have checked... maybe
this isn't so rare after all, eh?

-=Jim=-

P.S. Since this only has marginal relation to pine, I'll give a whack at
the question about preventing users from saving things to the mail spool
directory...

   First, why not stick the spool file in the users' directories- I know
this can be done, although it might mean hacking sendmail. OK, so I just
answered why not all on my own. ;)

   Second, if you can- limit the user to their home directory with pine's
(forget that dang name right now) feature. Be warned though- at least on
my system I couldn't use an alternate editor or speller.

   Third, set up a quota on the spool partition that only allows one
block. As long as it's a different logical partition, that should work.

   This is turning in to one of those questions like "how do I make a
mailing list" - there are literally 1024 answers or more. Maybe these
ideas will give someone better ones.

The problem is that the folder I get from the IMAP server is now always
"empty". I had no problem before. I have no problem FTPing that directory
with Lynx, and it is far from empty. I've tried it as a news collection. 

Can anyone tell me what could have chanjed?
Hav I been getting by miraculously with the wrong syntax?

This is supposed to be added in 4.0. See the 'MIME' section under:

I hate it, when Pine says:

  [Part 1, Application/PGP  667bytes]
  [Cannot display this part. Press "V" then "S" to save in a file]

So I added the following line in my .mailcap:

application/pgp; cat %s; copiousoutput

So now pine says:

  [Part 1, Application/PGP  667bytes]
  [Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part]

and I have to type vv to finally view the message. This is still a crutch!
Or is there another way? (apart from hacking pine)

I know this has been said before, but I'll say it again:

PLEASE make pine 4.0 pgp-aware.

I need to know how to find out how to mark messages as new messages rather
than having the marked as already read, how can I accomplish this?  I used
to know but didn't make a note.

I'm not sure if you need the "aggregate command" set for this.
The command to change flags is *, at least as I have PINE configured.

Ummm, a long command

; c a * n   (select/current/apply/flag/new)

If you want to select more than one message, well don't specify
Current.

BTW, you must have the 'enable-aggregate-command' flag set
(setup/config)

L8er, norbert.

Too many keystrokes for one message! To change the flag status for the current
message, from either the pager or index, "* n" or whatever flag you like.

>If you want to select more than one message, well don't specify Current.

Suppose you want to change the flags on all read messages:

; s ! n (select status not new)

This is confusing: The flag command under select is called status! I hope that
his is changed in version 4.

To change the flags back to new:

a * n (apply flag new)

Several flags can be changed: important (proprietary to pine), deleted, or
answered. Of course, deleted can be reversed with undelete.

pine only sets the "answered" flag when you reply to a message while it's still
in you inbox. If you've saved it to a folder, you must set the flag manually. I
hope this is fixed for version 4. Can the answered flag be seen by other mail
readers, or is this proprietary?

Important shows a "*" in the index. But, it gives you more flexibility to
select.

>BTW, you must have the 'enable-aggregate-command' flag set (setup/config)

You also need to activate the option "enable-flag-command".

Hi Adam.

Thanks very much for the update - looks like I should have a glimpse
into the online help again, I'm way off :-)

How about making PINE-4.0 publically available?  That's all I'm
hoping for at this point, some 3 months after being told that it
was "nearing completion".

Don't push. They aren't M$. Pine works now. It's also very cheap.
Wanna push for 4.0? Pull some source code an make sure it compiles with no
warnings, despite all warnings being enabled on your compiler.

Don't let the purple headed chicken eat the hairy fish.

I'll be happy if it compiles at all under my OS (OpenStep).  My
guess is that I will have to compile it under NeXTStep.  I've made
sure that pine/pico/pilot all compile before, and made them available
for those who prefer precompiled binaries.

Of course, that's all for 3.9x.... I don't have access to any 4.0 code to  
see whether or not that compiles.

I find the command "; s" (select status) confusingly named.

The command allows you select messages based on the status of their flags:
important, new, deleted, answered (or not flagged thusly).

Every other command that referes to flags calls it "*"! Two different names
isn't intuitive.

Is there a historical reason for this? Or, were there simply two different
programmers handling these aspects?

Does anyone know what's causing this user to have so many pinerc files in
their directory?  Running 3.95 on Digital Unix 4.0b.  Thanks:

I don't know if that's true.  I just overloaded one of my accounts and
tried to do a few things with Pine.  Generated a bunch of quota-related 
error messages but not one .pinerc123456789 file.

...that's two questions I think. I'm not sure about the first one.

As far as printing, a "Y" print command is, possibly requiring the
"aggregate command set" to be enabled.

I've been corresponding on USENET with someone who uses a mail2news
gateway. For some reason, when I reply, Pine ignores the newsgroups header
in his e-mail, leaving me to put it in.

Pine 3.95 also doesn't put a Followup-To: header in. I realize that these
should be redundant or useless to software. They are informativ to users
though. Does Pine 3.96 use them?

I just use the arrow keys on my VT102 terminal emulator: telix. Beyond
that, there's little I can write for you. I don't even know which version
of Pine you're using.

You aren't giving sufficient information. You aren't using the gateway? What
protocol do you use for Usenet reading?

Generally, it doesn't matter if you put in the newsgroups header or not. Pine
will ignore it in Mail. Unless a Path header is present, showing the bang path
route that the article took to reach your news server, you will not be allowed
to post a followup article to News.

This is actually one of pine's few well-behaved features related to News. Too
many news readers allow mail replies and include headers only applicable to
News, and too many mail readers will allow replies to be posted to News instead,
even if that wasn't the intent.

Put it in yourself with Customized-hdrs option in the configuration. Read the
context-sensitive help at that option.

Again, you can add that to a reply sent to you in Mail, but that won't be
sufficient for pine to allow you to post that in News. Followup-To is strictly a
News header.

In this case, since he's giving me a carbon copy via e-mail, I'm using
SMTP. I can and usually do yuuz NNTP.

Sure I will. I can put the newsgroups header in if Pine doesn't.

In this case, we assume an approval from a moderator, and converse more
rapidly than the approval process completes.

Pine is well-behaved when an NNTP posting host is available. As far as
being well-behaved when deciding whether to post, mail, or both, I'd
prefer to have that choice at submission time.

If I'M using a mail2news gateway because the number of groups is greater 
than five and I expect the post to fail, it doesn't really matter--I'll
send it to MIT's gateway. The post will fail locally. It's just a bit
messy, unless I answer "no" to "post?" at submission time.

What I'm saying is that Pine asks the question "post, mail, or both" 
twice, and it's a little sloppy the second time. In fact, if the post
fails, I might not want to mail, because that would mean I should
duplicate the mailing on the basis of an incorrect newgroups header alone.

That won't even work when sending to duplication-ignoring mailing lists
like yours. I think you should let your users use BRAINS to decide when to
post or mail, in that order, at submission time.

The feature would be especially useful NOW, when my newsreader is LISTING
comp.mail.pine, saying that it's invalid, and my sysadmins have the
"news-post-without-validation" flag fixed as disabled...exporting to TIN.

In the meantime, I guess I can just be notified of articles posted in
response to mine, and I'll reply to the post. There's a considerable delay
with moderated groups though.


I hav no problems with Windows users. I just have problems when they think
M$ invented the features in it, made them work together, or doesn't
try to cheat on taxes.

Actually that's not quite true:

All you need is the Path: line and something in it.

I used to use

Path: Bogus path for PINE

and that would work.

You do have to have a Path: line though, or else it thinks it wasn't a  
newsgroup message.

I find this rather annoying personally.

Yes, and that's specifically what Pine documentation says you don't hav to
do and shouldn't do because you don't have to do.

Ever wonder why intelligent disobedience IS?

Contradictions in what you're told to do to do what you want...and what
works are annoying.

Hmmm. Now comp.mail.pine is valid. Connection bugs? I remember that Pine
didn't try fetching the NG list again last time.

Our friend to whom I was replying won't believe me on this point.

Well, I never tried it with a bogus Path. Thanks! I've occassionally copied a
Path from another article to get pine to post.

>I find this rather annoying personally.

Well, it's better than the alternative of some news and mail clients that see
the Newsgroups and assume (incorrectly) that the author means to post News.
Someone will be sure to post an example of another client that has a better
approach, I expect.

Read what I just wrote a second time. On a reply, posting to News requires more
than adding a Newsgroups header. Pine won't inject the reply into the News
stream unless it thinks the original was News, not Mail.

Then you have no problem at all. Articles for moderated newsgroups are NEVER
injected into the news stream (unless a forgery!) but are mailed to the
moderator. So, mail it directly to the moderator's address!

Does the gateway require a Newsgroups header? They usually don't. Normally, you
put the newsgroup name in the To. That's the whole point of the gateway: to
transform an ordinary Mail message into an article. Since Newsgroups isn't a
valid Mail header, a well-behaved gateway doesn't expenct to find one.

You aren't being clear; I'm not following. What second time?

Notified how? Someone forwards followups? You really are unclear on what you are
trying to do.

Well, it seems I was wrong earlier. In 3.96, when replying to Mail, you CAN get
pine to inject an article into the news stream by adding a Newsgroups header.
However, no References header will be created and you still MAY NOT add this
header in the customized-hdrs option. To add this header, you must postpone the
article, and edit mail/postponed-msgs to add it, then continue the postponed
message in pine to inject it with the header.

I also tried saving News in a mailbox, editing the file to remove the Path
header, and then replying in pine. I was NOT allowed to post a followup.

Allowing a reply to Mail to be injected into News appears to be new behavior in
3.96. I recall that 3.95 didn't behave this way.

Cool!

If you crosspost similar or identical articles to so many newsgroups, you are
going to attract the attention of a cancelbot, and your articles will be
cancelled on numerous news servers. Generally, you should never crosspost to so
many groups; two or three at the very most.

Are you trying to use Pine to post articles in a shell script? Pine really isn't
designed for that. You'd have to convince your news administrator that you have
a valid need to use inews directly.

I tried another experiment. I posted to a test group and sent a courtesy copy to
myself. The courtesy copy, of course, didn't have a Path, but it did have
References because I added it as described above.

Upon replying to the Mail message, I was allowed to post to News! Even if I
removed the References header, I was still allowed to post to News. Only when I
removed the News header was I only allowed to reply in Mail.

I tried removing various other headers: Return-Path (perhaps because it never
left my mail server), Message-ID (was it parsing for a pine message?), and
others, but I was always allowed to post a reply to News.

I don't understand the difference in behavior between this message, and replying
to an article I saved to a mailbox. In the latter case, I was only allowed to
reply to News if the Path header remained!

What is the critical header in this case?

Sorry about the two previous blank messages. I didn't know that if I answered
"yes" to "attach current message" that you would fail to allow me to write text!

An error occurs when saving a message to a mailbox when the previous message has
no body and no blank line following the headers. The save operation Fails to
insert an additional New Line before the "[NL]From " boundary of the message
being saved. However, pine still sees the boundary, even though it's not
"[NL][NL]From "! If I read the newly-saved message and affect a flag (like open
an unread message or flag it answered), the mailbox is rewritten and not one,
but two additional New Lines are inserted before the boundary. Obviously, the
extra New Line can't cause trouble.

Please correct this bug so that whenever a message is saved to a mailbox, the
boundary is always preceded by two New Lines regardless of whether the last
message has trailing New Lines.

The version of 3.95 I'm using allows follow-ups to e-mail with just the
insertion of a newsgroups header: ^R while cursor is in the headers. I've
noticed only recently, that it does NOT do the references at ALL.

I hav no shell account.

I don't understand why Pine can't do it. It's two questions, actually.
Post?
Mail?

I guess you COULD leave "Both" as an option (gone with the second
question). The user would be taking a risk if posting to NGs and a
listserv at the same time. This is slightly different from TIN on the
system, which checks articles before posting: not to the cancelbot or 
moderator level of course.

Actually, if you've read the message first, you'll have to delete Pine's
proprietary headers.

Will they handle crossposting? I'd still have to put the NGs header in.

If there's a moderated group in the headers, it's sent to the moderator. If
there are multiple moderated groups, it's sent to the first moderator. It's up
to the first moderator to inject it into the newsstream.

I believe this is what should NORMALLY happen (if there is plenty of space):

1.  Pine tries to write new version of the preferences file.

2.  Pine checks that all the bytes were successfully written out.

3.  Pine renames the new version of the file over the old.

This sequence prevents you losing or truncating your live settings file if
you run out of space during the write operation (which is what would happen
if the live preference file's content were simply written over).

Of course if, at step 2, Pine discoverd it couldn't write out all the bytes
it has to decide what to do with what it HAS managed to write out.  Should
it delete the (incomplete) file?  Or should it leave it in situ so that the
user can try and rescue any settings they had altered from out of it?

Pine seems to adopt the latter approach.

Whilst sensible in general, it might be an idea if Pine 4.00 could stat()
the incomplete file and, if it is 0 bytes, delete it?  At least this would
stop the proliferation of empty "new" files!

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell

Recently I found silly remote overflow in pine. It's so simple there's no
need to describe it:

From: Michal Zalewski  
<lcamtuf@AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA>

...and any attempt of reading this mail will cause:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()

It can be exploited to gain access to remote/local accounts. Fortunately,
too long headers are destroyed by sendmail during prescan (maybe there's
any way to split long line using encoding tricks):

Jun 17 16:49:24 genome sendmail[689]: QAA00689: SYSERR(root): prescan:
token too long

But other mail daemons aren't so strict - it works.

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN



Hello
	I wanted to use pico with an other mailer (MH) in this case
	I just use it as any other editor. However, the thing I was 
	wondering about is that if I use pico from pine it has 
	ability to automatically format quoted email. That is
	if I have an email quoted with ">" at beginning of each
	line and then press ctrl-j to justify it, it does
	automagically takes care of the ">" chars.

	How do I enable this feature when MH is calling pico? 
	the only remotely likey option seems be "-t" but it 
	does not quote seems to work.

	Ideas?

I recently downloaded PCPine, and am thinking about using it as our campus
mail client.  However, in our computer labs, the person using an
individual computer is never the same.  The main problem with this is the
user-id and personal-name fields need to be changed every time someone
logs in.  Is there a way to get these to default to the users name on our
mailserver without asking the user if that is what he or she wants to do,
and without writing it into the pinerc file each time?  Thanks for your
help.

I just wrote a little script to insert the appropriate user
information into the pinerc file upon login and the rest is history.
No, PCpine doesn't setup as nice as the UNIX version in this
situation, but I hope they will change that in the future.

The feature is unique to the pine composer. You'll notice that it isn't
available when resuming editing on a postponed message.

If you set those variables in the pinerc to the null string (i.e. two
double quotes) then Pine will not ask the user if they want to save the
name/userid to the pinerc file, and each user will be prompted for their
own name/id for their session.

I hav access to two news-readers on this system. The threaded one's called
tin. It uses pico, so I have the same question. Is there a switch on pico
to enable ^J?

I also use pico with Lynx. When using pico with tin or Lynx, and after
hitting ^R, using [tab] to complete filenames isn't available either.
Is there a switch on pico to enable filename completion?

Would make sense, since I did looked into pico source and did not see
anything like this, then again I did not look too carefully.


This brings question what other Mail-aware editors are out there [1]

-Adam
[1] Emacs does not count since it is too slow to start each time
I want to send an email. It would be ok if it could run in
daemon mode in background and starting an extra emacs would 
just load an extra front-end only. Unfortunatelly it is not
what emacs-client does.

Loads of them. At the moment, I`m using vim. It can handle almost anything,
except of course (in its default settings) your reply string. Change it.

It is. You must be doing something wrong. However, if you`re using Emacs
anyway, you might as well use its built-in Mail-/Newsreader Gnus.

I've noticed a couple of posts to USENET from offline express.
That started out as a shareware FidoNet mailer. I once used it.

The thing I miss about it is the tagline manager. If you're not familiar
with taglines, they're the same as "signatures", except they're always one
line and they usually change from post to post of the same author.

That's because the author has a collection they choose from, or let the
mailer choose randomly. Currently, I crudely imitate a tagline manager
with a small collection of files that I insert after a message. 

Typically, taglines are the last line, or lines of a post, and they start
with an asterisk. That lets you hit one key to steal someone's tagline,
which is often a one-liner from Star Trek, the Simpsons, or something
about being hooked on roasted, green, bitter beans.

...I write my own...Or fix someone else's...

Nah...that's just the random function of a tagline manager. I didn't
use that function of my tagline manager very often.

It just wouldn't be the same as splicing into Pine's addressbook code,
especially if that code is reasonably reusable.

On 27 May I sent the Discussion Forum a note describing problems I, as a
new PINE user, was having with some characters which were mistranslated,
and I thought that the problem was with my configuration of pine not
handling the iso-8859-1 character set translation.

I was wrong.  PINE on my sunos system handles normal iso-8859-1 fine.

But I still get some characters mistranslated, and after some sleuthing
by myself and John Berthels <John.Berthels@nexor.co.uk>, I think we have
an answer and that it is likely of interest to members of the list and the
authors of pine.

In the iso-8859-1 8-bit extension of US-ASCII, the first 32 character
codes (hex 80-9F) are not used.  These ARE used in two "extensions" of the
8-bit character set, one is in the Windows Character Set and in the html
which is written by "Save as" to html in clarisworks (and maybe others)
and interpreted in Netscape 4 (but not Netscape 3).  (HTML v3.2 also does
not use those 32 character codes, so Netscape 4 is "nonstandard" in this=20
respect unless there is a more recent "accepted" html character set).

Hence if you get mail using pine (or eudora) which was written by a
netscape 4.x mailer (or others, perhaps), you will get several characters
mistranslated.  The most obvious of these is the apostrophe used in
contractions like "Physician's".  Instead of being transmitted as 39
decimal (27 hex), it comes across as a curly apostrophe with the code
decimal 146 (hex 92).  Here is a line from my most recent troublesome
document:=20

     The Physician^=D2s Dilemma:

On my xterm window, this comes across as the character with iso-8859-1
code 210 decimal (D2 hex) -- an offset of 64 decimal (40 hex) from what I
see when I use my Sun Mailtool and look at the untranslated quoted
printable rendition.  (John writes concerning the truly unprintable
characters hex 0-31, "A common way to print these to screen is as a caret
'^' followed by a character. Carriage return (ASCII 13 decimal) is printed
as ^M - and the 'M' character is ASCII decimal 77 =3D 13 + 64. So Pine is
being helpful and using the same convention for the 'upper control
characters' "unprintable" characters is commonly done."=20

Others from among the 32 characters which can be bothersome are smart
quotes (single and double), various length dashes and the ... (ellipsis).

Assuming we have identified the problem correctly, the question is what to
do about it?  It may be that some mail server translators (like the one
for the PINE List) can or do some renditions in 8-bit translation.  (But a
recipient using netscape would like to get his curly quotes so might not
appreciate any other translation.)  As I can see the curly quotes, etc.,
within Netscape on the same machine I use for pine, there is a font set
which knows about them, so maybe pine could not add 64 decimal to these
characters but just display them.  Or one could put in a simple filter
which translates the characters into printable ones -- hex 92 gets changed
to hex 27, etc.

I (and John) would appreciate comments and suggestions.  If someone
already has such a filter, please share.  If you want references
documenting any of the above, we have it.  (The PC Character Map and the
extended html set are not quite identical, for example.)

In fact, I was having just such a discussion with someone from Germany a few
weeks ago about this very miscoded character!

Kitty,

If by "customised" you mean a form letter, there are ways.  The simplest
is to create the form letter in plain text, and save the file in a public
or shared directory.  Then users can copy the message to their home direc-
tory and read it into the body of their messages using ^R in compose mode.

That would be because it does nothing to it, except for display.

That's code page 850, not iso-8859-1. There have been no changes to
iso-8859-1 regarding use of characters below 0x20, or for about 32
characters above 0x80.

As I mentioned, this is code page 850. Yes. NetScape is folowing M$
towards possible backwards incompatibility if the IETF or ISO bodies
extend iso-8859-1 and others.

Decimal 146 is within an excluded range of iso-8859-1. It's okay for 8bit,
as in binary files. It shouldn't be printable.

In order to do that, you would have to make everyone register with the
character set that they use. Asking NetScape to document these
non-standards as

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=code-page-850

would make more sense. Pine might then know how to translate such
characters into printables for display.

I'm not sure why Pine is adding 64 to characters between 0x80 and 0xBF
inclusive. Possibly, those are already used for terminal control, which
means that you could change that code in Pine yourself if those characters
are printable on your terminal (with that font you mention loaded).

If by "customised" you mean "personalized form letter", you're best off
using another program, like WordPerfect, to generate the letters. Just
use the "ASCII text printer" printer driver to make it print to a file.

While that will speed up creation of the letters a bit, it will also
result in one large file. That's fine.

If you take a look at your postponed messages file, and make a WordPerfect
form that will imitate that file format, you should be able to minimize
the necessary work.

That should reduce the work to a few key-strokes per message. If you could
turn off Pine's display and run a keyboard macro for the purpose, you'd be
laughing. As it is, you're stuck with a lot of unnecessary display if you
can figure out how to write the keyboard macro.

Almost...see 'control character' bit below.

Cool (I didn't know the name for it). Its code page 850. Unfortunately
this is what Netscape 4 (at least)  will produce and label as text/plain;
charset=iso-8859-1 [It and IE also understand these codes as &XXX;
'ampersand tags' in HTML documents.]

I'm not sure, but I think this range is already used in iso-8859-1 for
non-printable control characters.

Yup. But as above, Netscape labels this bodypart as iso-8859-1. Bad
netscape.

This would be the best solution, naturally.

PINE seems to do the same thing for the 80->bf control characters as it
does for the 00->1f ones. Namely print a caret '^', followed by a
character which has the code of the control character + 64.

[e.g. ^M for carriage return. This practice is common - is it standardised
anywhere?]


Attached is a little perl script which maps a couple of these CP 850
characters to similar glyphs in iso-8859-1. I've installed it with a

display-filters=_CHARSET(ISO-8859-1)_ /path/to/the/filter/8859filt

line. Seems to work, but I don't get much of this mail.


In the spirit of "liberal in what you expect", would a config option to
perform similar translations to characters in this illegal range in a
iso-8859-1 text be a good thing to add to pine? [Would remove the overhead
of running the display filter.]

Hi!

I want to write an application in C using the interface that Pine uses:
control keys, move with arrows keys, highlighted text, frames, etc. How
can I do that? What libraries I should use and where can I find them?

Have a nice day!

Hello to all readers!

I am not subscribed to this list, so if you have a suggestion, please send
it to me directly (in addition to the list, if you like).

I love PINE (v. 3.96 on Sun Solaris 2.6) and the Select feature (using the
semi-colon) is really superb.  My problem is that I often have to find a
collection of messages that are in different folders.  I end up having to
reapply the same command in one folder after another.  If only PINE could
search across multiple folders simultaneously! 

Will future versions of PINE have this feature?  If not, is there any
software out there that can search a collection of mbox files and output
another mbox containing all the messages that meet certain criteria? 

Thanks much!

Mike

Hi to all from a fresh subscriber to the mailing list!

First of all, apologies for the previous letter. It slipped through my
fingers (I pressed ^X instead of ^C :) Maybe the keys for "Cancel" and
"Send" should be a bit more distant from each other. But that was not what
I wanted to write about.

I'm delighted to have seen that a new version of Pine is due to be released
(I won't ask when :) It is the only mail client I've found up to now that
works perfectly in all the environments I work in, Silicon Graphics' Irix
6.2, WinNT, Win95 and Win3.11 (this is also one of the reasons I use vim
for editing ASCII files on all these platforms).

I was, however, dissapoined to hear that it will not yet have possibility
of off-line operation and I believe, in these days of portable computers,
that it would be a *major* plus for Pine.

What I propose is actually simpler than off-line or disconnected operation.
Let me explain what I've done and maybe this will clarify the idea. I have
a portable PC with Windows NT and the imap server is a SGI Indy running
Irix. Unfortunately, I only have access to Internet during the office hours
and I don't have time in the office for the longer letters. Now, since Pine
needs to connect to an imap server to compose a message, I've solved the
problem by installing a free imap server for WinNT on my portable. Actually
it's a complete mail server (Vintra), but it also understands imap.

This means that now I can log on to the local server, compose a letter at
home and postpone it, then, at the office and using a different .pinerc,
log on to the real server and send the letter. I created some folders
locally, where I keep copies of correspondence with people with whom I
exchange longer letters, otherwise all the folders are on the server.

What I believe is a possible and a very simple way of solving (temporarily
at least) the lack of off-line or disconnected mode is to incorporate a
'dummy' imap server into Pine itself. If you couldn't log on to a real imap
server, you'd be given a choice to use the dummy server and you could then
compose and postpone messages but not mail them. The dummy server's INBOX
would, of course, be empty (or possibly nonexistent), but at least you'd be
able to see local folders.

I *know* that you can achieve the same thing by just editing a file in a
temporary directory and then reading it into a composition, but it would be
more convenient to be able to work like I described.

Cheers,
Jan

Anyone know of anyone who has gotten pine to compile on rhapsody? I've got
a friend who is trying to do just that and failing rather spectacularly.
Ideas? Links? Small furry beasts from betelguese?

I agree with this one! I've embarrased myself one to many times this way.

of course, the ultimate in convenience is just to have a machine you can
log in remotely too -- and keep everything on it..but then I've always
been a bit of a packrat :)

Ah, yes, but that implies that you always have access to the network. In
fact, the suggestion I sent only came about after I moved temporarily to
Belgium. Since I work at nuclear research instutute, where the security is
relatively high, I don't have access to my office during weekends and I
don't have a phone in my room to hook up to the network.

In fact, the *most* important reason why I chose imap and Pine is that I
can keep my folders on the server and either run Pine on the server itself
or on a PC (depending, for instance, whether I want to attach a file that's
on the PC or on the server), and *always* have the same state of folders,
no matter where I am. But, as I said, you need to have access to the
network for that.

Cheers,
Jan

BTW, what *is* the exotic machine you've mentioned?

which? My set up (which is just a linux box that is happily networked) or
Rhapsody which is an Apple dev'd unix-type-os for macintosh that
officially was stillborn, but rumours abound on it's future.

*rotfl*

<http://developer.apple.com/rhapsody/>
Rhapsody is the code-name of Apple's upcoming operating system which will
complement Mac OS by providing an advanced environment for servers and
software development. While still running the huge library of existing
Macintosh programs, Rhapsody also includes a breakthrough software development
platform, code-named Yellow Box, for building new classes of reliable,
media-rich and cross platform applications. Rhapsody will provide superior
Java and Internet support, and is based on the tools used to create
revolutionary technologies such as the World Wide Web.


In short: MacOS sans bugs (hopefully...) plus a disembowelled NeXTstep. Could
have been a killer 3 years ago. Doesnt stand a bit of a chance against Linux
in 1998 if you ask me.

I decided that I would take PINE-INFO as daily digests, so I'll post a
response to my query on searching across multiple folders using the select
command.  Great news--Pine 4.00 will include this facility.  In the
meantime, I did discover a way to get what I wanted using the Unix 'cat'
command.  I leave Pine, cd to my mail directory, then

cat foldernames > newfolder

This command will take a collection of folders and it will append them all
together into one big folder called "newfolder".  "foldernames" could be
wildcard name like "sent*" or a series of filenames.  The 'newfolder'
might be huge, and that is one of the main drawbacks of this method.  Then
go back into pine, enter the "newfolder" folder, and do the select.  It
could be slow, but it works. 

Regards to all,

Mike

There's an Intel (binary) version of it... haven't heard of a PowerPC version

> In short: MacOS sans bugs (hopefully...) plus a disembowelled NeXTstep.

Not really.  MacOS with protected memory (ie won't crash/lockup like your  
Mac) and hopefully with less bugs.

The NeXTStep part is difficult... they are keeping most of the Mac GUI which  
could have been vastly improved on by adding the NeXTStep elements.

However, the kernel will be based on BSD4.4, which will actually be  
significantly better than what NeXTStep had.


> Could have been a killer 3 years ago.

It could have been extremely killer almost 10 years ago if Apple hadn't  
decided to cut its wrist by sending Steve Jobs packing.... NeXT, inc's OS  
together with greater resources would have been a big plus.


> Doesn't stand a bit of a chance against Linux in 1998 if you ask me.

Apple has killed Intel support (NeXTStep worked on HP/Sparc/NeXT  
hardware/and Intel) which turned me from optimistic to extremely pessimistic  
about its future.  I'm not sure Linux is the biggest competitor.  Anyone who  
has installed both will tell you that NeXTStep is 100% easier to setup and  
when you're done you have the beautiful GUI as opposed to a commandline  
interface trying to get X (blech) running.

Anyway, we're way off topic here... there's a Rhapsody discussion list at  
http://www.omnigroup.com for those who want to know more

Well, it's not the Real Thing(tm), but it's damn close in look and
feel if you ask me: <http://www.windowmaker.org/>. And yes, it's OT -

Can any anyone kindly tell me if there is a "bcc" function in the pine 
program?  It would certainly help us distribute mails in a much effective 
way.  Thx.

Short answer: Yes, I can tell you that there is :-)

Longer one: In compose mode, while being in the header region, type ^R 
(rich header) and find the field :-)

Your editor's behaviour of wrapping long lines is especially annoying when trying to transfer files in 8bit binary mode....The wrapping will inevitably cause errors.

I address it to a group of people, developers included. One copy of it
comes back to me. I know who sent it, and it wasn't me. Maybe it's to me
if I can answer it.

If that bothers you, I'll go with "Pico's behaviour" when I know that
there isn't a switch to turn this line-warping off, or when I know who has
final say in how Pico behaves. As far as I can tell, no one has final say,
or it'll be the same in Version 4.0.

A) Why are you sending binaries via email rather than ftp?

B) Why are you opening binaries in an editor rather than just attaching them  
(in the headers of PINE)?

Wrapping *SHOULD* be done on the text of a message, but not the attachments.

If you aren't attaching them, this is pilot error (ie you)

If you are attaching them (using the Attchmnt: header) then it is a PINE  
error, but I've transferred binaries this way when I had to and there was no  
problem.

If I attach them, Pine puts them in Base 64 beyond my control, which isn't as universal as JustSend8, or 8bitmime, especially with old mailers. Attachments certainly require human knowledge of MIME, which is more common.

Why bother going through the trouble of telling someone how to get and use a base64 tool, when an 8bit binary will do the trick 9 times out of 10.

I've also received several (about 10) messages where the paragraphs were NOT wrapped. Pine wrapped them correctly in the viewer.

Then put it on a webpage and let those who want it download it.

You needn't make it publically available, make a directory like  
'privatestuff' touch 'index.html' and put the file in that directory.

Tell those who want it where to find it.

Email is the wrong method of sending binaries no matter how man people use  
it.  See 'man uuencode' for a good look at how inefficient it is (25 or 35%  
IIRC)

What kind of file is it?  Have you tried (g)zip-ping it (depending on who  
you are sending it to)

Ah, but they have mail spool space?  Ok, whatever--I don't think FTP
is the answer either.

I think it's odd that these people with old mailers have modern mail 
delivery programs, but again, not the point.  It sounds like in 
your daily practice you don't have a problem with mailers stripping
out your high bit from under you.

You bring up a good point;  it might be a nice feature if Pine gave you 
a choice of encodings.

I believe that Pico has a limitation of 255 character lines.  There is
no motivation to extend that limitation, because it is a simple text 
editor.

If you wish to include binary files directly in your messages, you'll
need to use Pine's "alternate editor" facility.  I personally use 
"enable-alternate-editor-implicitly" to invoke it automatically.

That's over 8bit. 8bit, MIME or not, is just as efficient as binary FTP, maybe a little bit more efficient, counting overhead--definitely more efficient if you count the overhead in the assumption that your recipient even HAS ftp access.
They could be on FidoNet.

My version of Pine puts HTML attachments in Base 64. I don't see any place in the mimetypes file for changing that.

Basically, my question is this: Why can't I make a binary into the main message instead of making it an attachment? Pine won't necessarily document the font correctly in that case, and who will care? On another viewpoint, there's these paragraphs that Pine warps into lines.

Let's assume I'm talking FidoNet then. They adopted 8bit last decade. That makes them both modern and old. Then again, I might not be talking about FidoNet, since only DEC provides an 8bit (JustSend8) SMTP mailer "PATCH" in compliance with RFC 821.

I've had no problems with the 8th bit being stripped from foreign language messages, even with intermediary SMTP.

If it remains a simple text editor and only SMTP compatible, Pine and Pico will eventually die and be supplanted by MH or something that does X.400. As far as that 255 character line length limitation, if I ever bother to adjust Pine myself the second thing I'll do is make that limit 2^16 or 2^32.

8bit software went out with the Apple ][.

Well...if there's an editor which doesn't give command-line or low-level programming language facilities, and it's as convenient as Pine, I'll test it for stability and recommend it to my sysop.

...If everyone does that, then who would waste time developing Pico?

Dear Pine-info,

I have several folders with +1000 messages in them.
When I open the folder, it takes several minutes and about 60megs of
memory to load. Is there anyway for pine to ONLY load the index screen 
(message header info) into memory? Once the message is selected for
opening, only that message would be read into memory.

PS Partitioning the folders into several smaller folders is not a feasible
   option for the nature of my system.



best regards,

Dear Raja, thank you for playing. Really, it's ok. We got your

There are other mailers out there already.

PINE and PICO have the advantage of being simple and easy to use.  If you  
want something more, there are other options for you rather than forcing all  
the PINE/PICO users in the world to put up with code bloat for a feature only  
you seem to care about.

Go for it.  That's the nice thing about having source.

pine/pico are stable and convenient because they do what they do in a very  
simple way.

Mine puts HTML files as text/plain.

There ain't no way to put an attachment in the body of the message, other  
than uuencode.

If your recipients really don't have access to the web and you really don't  
have a web page, and you really can't get around this using zip or gzip  
(which would make the attachment smaller anyway) then I think you are SOL as  
far as using PINE for this.

Hah hah, sure, the people who use Pine with Pico are going to switch
to MH.

In general, there's no point to extending Pico's editing capabilities to 
enable binary files.  It doesn't make it a "stupid" program; the Pine
designers intend for you to use file attachments.  For most of the
internet, I think that's reasonable.

Pico is a line editor, not a binary editor.  Besides, you don't want
to *edit* binary files, correct?  You just don't want them to be 
encoded, which Pine enforces with an iron base64 fist.

It could be more useful in your case, if Pine allowed you to select 
your encoding method.  (It doesn't because sending 8bit files directly
is generally thought of as a bad idea.)

Not everyone uses a different editor.  

Changing NLINE and NSTRING in pico/estruct.h to support longer line 
lengths seems to be enough.  I wouldn't recommend 2^32, though.

Good luck with your peculiar situation.

What is your problem? Despite your complaint about pico breaking lines longer
than 254 characters, you have no trouble annoying me by sending lines in text
messages longer than 80 characters.

The reason one doesn't send binaries in text messages is because mail transport
is known to corrupt long lines, given that it was never designed not to. It is
irrelevant if you can make it leave your own system intact. It is unlikely to
arrive intact on the far end.

If they don't have space for it, what the hell do you expect them to do with it
once they receive it?

The pine developers feel that Base 64 encoding tends to survive mail transport
better than other methods. I'll take their word for it, unless you intend to
make a supportable argument to the contrary.

uuencode is extremely common, and is the tool to deal with Base 64.

So that the attachment arrives intact. That's a good reason.

Bully for you.

Call me a chatterbox today, but uudecode deals with the "uuencode"
format--not base64.  Dealing with base64 when you don't have a
MIME-compliant mail reader can be a pain.

POSIX-compliant uuencode -m encodes base64. The formats are rather similar.
Today, aren't all uuencodes using base64?

Do you know of any tool that can deal with base-64 format?

uuencode/uudecode -m on Linux; you may need to invoke a different option on your
unix.

And, of course, pine. Attachments encoded in base64 are automatically decoded.

Hmm, which platform? What do you want to do?

Pine can handle it (that's what the discussion is about, partly, I
guess).

XEmacs :-)

mmencode (UNIX)

I think, Netscape is also able to handle it.

That is: All of these tools should be able to extract the data
contained in base64 encoded text.

L8er, norbert.

I'm not quite sure that the "is more common" refers to, but Base 64 is in
fact the principal encoding scheme of MIME.

As others have mentioned, there are good reasons for encoding attachments
--if you care about them arriving intact-- but it is also true that if you
turn on Pine's feature to enable esmtp negotiation *and* you have an ESMTP
capable MTA that supports 8BITMIME, then Pine will negotiate the use of
8BITMIME rather than Base64 MIME.
