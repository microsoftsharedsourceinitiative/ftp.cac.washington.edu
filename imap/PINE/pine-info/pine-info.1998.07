I couldn't find mmencode or mmdecode on my Unix system (Sun Solaris 2.6),
but I downloaded mpack and munpack (*not* part of Solaris).  I've appended
some info about those two programs.

Regarding line wrapping.  I sometimes use a program called Jpico instead
of Pico.  Jpico is a version of JOE (Joe's Own Editor) with Pico-like key
bindings.  It doesn't wrap long lines and it can do search and replace. 
You can read more here:

http://fileserver.hrz.uni-marburg.de/tools/joe-2.8/html/INFO

Jpico also seems to use a little less RAM than does Pico, at least on my
system.  So it's a great alternative editor for a die-hard Pico user.

               mpack/munpack version 1.5 for unix

Mpack and munpack are utilities for encoding and decoding
(respectively) binary files in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) format mail messages.  For compatibility with older forms
of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode
messages in split-uuencoded format.  The Macintosh version can also
decode messages in split-BinHex format.

Versions are included for unix, pc, os2, mac, amiga and archimedes
systems.  The canonical FTP site for this software is
ftp.andrew.cmu.edu:pub/mpack/

This MIME implementation is intended to be as simple and portable as
possible.  For a slightly more sophisticated MIME implementation, see
the program MetaMail, available via anonymous FTP to
thumper.bellcore.com, in directory pub/nsb


Decoding MIME messages:

First, you have to compile the munpack program.  See the instructions
in the section "Compilation" below.  If, after reading the
instructions, you are still unsure as to how to compile munpack,
please try to find someone locally to help you.

To decode a MIME message, first save it to a text file.  If possible,
save it with all headers included.  Munpack can decode some MIME files
when the headers are missing or incomplete, other files it cannot
decode without having the information in the headers.  In general,
messages which have a statement at the beginning that they are in MIME
format can be decoded without the headers.  Messages which have been
split into multiple parts generally require all headers in order to be
reassembled and decoded.

Some LAN-based mail systems and some mail providers (including America
Online, as of the writing of this document) place the mail headers at
the bottom of the message, instead of at the top of the message.  If
you are having problems decoding a MIME message on such a system, you
need to convert the mail back into the standard format by removing the
system's nonstandard headers and moving the standard Internet headers
to the top of the message (separated from the message body with a
blank line).

There must be exactly one message per file.  Munpack cannot deal with
multiple messages in a single file, to decode things correctly it must
know when one message ends and the next one begins.

To decode a message, run the command:

	munpack file

where "file" is the name of the file containing the message.  More than
one filename may be specified, munpack will try to decode the message in
each file.  For more information on ways to run munpack, see the section
"Using munpack" below.


Reporting bugs:

Bugs and comments should be reported to mpack-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu.
When reporting bugs or other problems, please include the following
information:

  * The version number of Mpack
  * The platform (Unix, PC, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, Archimedes)
  * The EXACT output of any unsuccessful attempts.
  * If having a problem decoding, the first couple of lines
    of the input file.


Compilation:

The mpack distribution should compile with no changes on most unix
systems.  There are a few exceptions--if compiling on SunOS, SVR4, SCO
Unix, or an ancient BSD without the strchr() function, edit the
Makefile and uncomment the relevant lines.

Compile with the command:

    make

If you want to install the programs and man pages in a common place,
use the command:

    make install DESTDIR=/installation/path

where "/installation/path" is the path of the tree you want to install
the files into.  The default value of DESTDIR is "/usr/local", which
installs the programs in the directory "/usr/local/bin" and the man
pages in "/usr/local/man/man1".

Using mpack:

Mpack is used to encode a file into one or more MIME format messages.
The program is invoked with:

	mpack [options] -o outputfile file

or 

	mpack [options] file address...

or

	mpack [options] -n newsgroups file

Where "[options]" is one or more optional switches described below.
"-o outputfile" is also described below. "file" is the name of the
file to encode, "address..." is one or more e-mail address to mail the
resulting messages to and "newsgroups" is a comma-separated list of
newsgroups to post the resulting messages to.

The possible options are:

     -s subject
          Set the Subject header field to Subject.   By default,
          mpack will prompt for the contents of the subject
          header.

     -d descriptionfile
          Include the contents of the file descriptionfile in an
          introductory section at the beginning of the first
          generated message.

     -m maxsize
          Split the message (if necessary) into partial messages,
          each not exceeding maxsize characters.  The default
          limit is the value of the SPLITSIZE environment 
	  variable, or no limit if the environment variable
          does not exist.  Specifying a maxsize of 0 means there
          is no limit to the size of the generated message.

     -c content-type
          Label the included file as being of MIME type
          content-type, which must be a subtype of application,
          audio, image, or video.  If this switch is not given,
          mpack examines the file to determine its type.

     -o outputfile
          Write the generated message to the file outputfile.  If
          the message has to be split, the partial messages will
          instead be written to the files outputfile.01,
          outputfile.02, etc.

The environment variables which control mpack's behavior are:

     SPLITSIZE
          Default value of the -m switch.  Default "0".

     TMPDIR
	  Directory to store temporary files.  Default "/tmp".


Using munpack:

Munpack is used to decode one or more messages in MIME or
split-uuencoded format and extract the embedded files.  The program is
invoked with:

	munpack [options] filename...

which reads the messages in the files "filename...".  Munpack may also
be invoked with just:

	munpack [options]

which reads a message from the standard input.

If the message suggests a file name to use for the imbedded part, that
name is cleaned of potential problem characters and used for the
output file.  If the suggested filename includes subdirectories, they
will be created as necessary.  If the message does not suggest a file
name, the names "part1", "part2", etc are used in sequence.

If the imbedded part was preceded with textual information, that
information is also written to a file. The file is named the same as
the imbedded part, with any filename extension replaced with
".desc"

The possible options are:

     -f
          Forces the overwriting of existing files.  If a message
          suggests a file name of an existing file, the file will be
          overwritten.  Without this flag, munpack appends ".1", ".2",
          etc to find a nonexistent file.

     -t
	  Also unpack the text parts of multipart messages to files.
	  By default, text parts that do not have a filename parameter
	  do not get unpacked.

     -q
          Be quiet--suppress messages about saving partial messages.

     -C directory
          Change the current directory to "directory" before reading
          any files.  This is useful when invoking munpack
          from a mail or news reader.

The environment variables which control munpack's behavior are:

     TMPDIR
          Root of directory to store partial messages awaiting 
          reassembly.  Default is "/usr/tmp".   Partial messages
	  are stored in subdirectories of $TMPDIR/m-prts-$USER/

The uudecode that comes with slrn works okay with it as far as I can tell.
It also has the added benefit of being able to decode multiple attachments
in the same file.

I'm not sure (because it's been a while), but I think using *.mtx
mailbox format (Tenex format?) would permit this (for local files).

There is a way to make messages into a more efficient file system.
You can begin the message file with offsets into the file for the
beginning of each message for instance.

Hello !!!

Somebody said that if you don't want pine to delete your sent-mail folder
then you must put this in your .pinerc file:

# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.
last-time-prune-questioned=110.1

But now pine won't move my saved-messages to new folder every month.
Is there a fix, so that pine will move my saved-messages to a new folder
every new month and still not delete my sent-mail folder???
TNX!

								Bye.

I used a system that let you inquire when someone read the subject, read
the message, and deleted the message (you could tell how big a twit they
think you are :-). Pine docs deprecate doing that, saying it's not always
practical and would increase required bandwidth, which are true. Of
course, that doesn't mean the post office doesn't do it anyway with
double-registered mail.

In other words, maybe next millenium.

Well, depends on the system and the system security policy of your
partner(s). UNIX provides a finger command which sometimes also
displays information about (un)read mails. But I doubt that this
option is given. It's a major security leak.

I should've mentioned that I had that feature on a closed (nearly) 
mainframe. Over the internet, you'd need public-key crypto and key
authenticity infrastructure that will probably take another two to five
years to develop.

As I said, not this millenium.

Just to beat this to death, attached is a filter re-written in C which
does a similar job to the previously posted perl version but: 

a) doesn't require perl start-up time per bodypart display
b) recognises many more code page 850 codes
c) requires compiling (duh): try "gcc 8859filt.c -o 8859filt"

For those who aren't supremely disinterested in this, the problem this
tries to solve is the presence of character codes in the 0x80 -> 0x9f
range in bodyparts labelled as iso-8859-1.

Such bodyparts seem to be generated by mailers including Netscape 4, which
incorrectly insert these codes to represent characters from code page 850. 

This filter replaces some of these codes with 'lookalike' sequences from
the legal iso-8859-1 range.

The comment at the beginning of the program gives terse help on installing
in PINE.


[I guess the other workaround to this might be to use a font in codepage
850 (presumably one of the ones netscape uses?) and unset the PINE
variable: send-control-characters-as-is]


Have fun,

Can any knowledgeable pine user tell me how to delete the old message
which constantly appears when I want to send a message?
It is a number of very old messages I sent when I first used pine, and it
reappears each time I wish to write.

Since you haven't given a complete description of what's happening, I can only
guess. When you invoke the composer, are you offered the opportunity to continue
either interrupted or postponed messages? If you no longer need them, answer
"yes", choose one of the messages, and cancel it when you are in the composer.

You get a postponed message when you use control-o in the composer. You may get
an interrupted message if you drop your connection and pine is able to save it.

All the above headers came from the same message. Pine 3.95 is apparently
using quoted-printable and 8bit at the same time. Fixed someone this
bug in Pine 3.96?

Nope.  NeXT machines, for one, are still using uuencode which != base64 and  
I would imagine older SunOS machines are doing the same.

I believe a Content-Transfer-Encoding header just applies to the bodypart
(or single bodypart message) it heads.

The use of RFC2047 headers (the encoding quoted above) is unrelated to the
choice of transfer encoding used.

In a similar way, in a multi-bodypart message, each bodypart may have a
different Content-Transfer-Encoding.

So, I don't think this is a bug.

Hello,
does anyone here happen to know a Pine function 
to allow for 
	deferred mailing, 
i.e. send a mail at a defined date/time ?

Do Pine 3.96 or forthcoming 4.0 ease in some way the use of 
well-known mailer / operating system features (cron etc) 
to this end or support any such function by themselves ?

Direct replies welcome.
TIA and kind regards,
hal :-)

How would I get the latest version of Pine 3.96 for SCO unix
3.2.4

Would it have to be compiled for SCO as I didn't see a SCO
version of Pine on the FTP site.

Thank You

Mean you that it's supposed to be "quoted-printable" by default, and
there's no way to put 8bit in headers?

If not, the design sucks. It looks horrible, and the threaded news reader
(Tin) here doesn't do "quoted-printable". It would've been better to
specify that MIME headers come first. They do if you put 8bit characters
in headers anyway.

There's a few addresses from which I do not want to receive mail, and I
was hoping there was a way to permanently block incoming messages from
them.  Is there?  Can anybody help?  

Thanks

Sure. Just read the Pine FAQ (called QandA) to find the URL for Nancy
McGough's fabulous filtering mail FAQ. All the answers are in there.

Something else: please use a meaningful subject - "help" describes 99% 
of all requests sent here.

   If you're root on your server, this shouldn't be too difficult to do-
just set up mail to "whatever@yourdomain" to point to either a junk mail
account that you periodically clean out or to /dev/null.

   If you're not root, or you otherwise don't want to mess with that kind
of thing, set up a .forward to the dummy account for each account you want
to block from receiving mail. (won't work if you're trying to keep users
from modifying this) (can probably even direct the mail into /dev/null too
although I've never tried it)

   If absolute worst comes to worst, simply create a soft link to
/dev/null in the mail spool directory corresponding to that account name.
What comes in won't stay in for very long.

   There are probly other ways too.

   Procmail is cool- and definitely worth learning, but probably not the
tool to do this job depending upon what you really want to do.

   OK- I totally blew it and misinterpreted that question... Ignore
everything I said in it. Procmail actually *is* the tool for the job- I
had the work order upside-down. ;)

ok - the short story....

had an PINE addressbook all setup from some time back - 

had been working with an apparently older version of pine in those days
(1.5-2 years ago) - that handled addressbook functions differently - now
have pine 3.96 on lava.net 's unix shell.

the older? vers, allowed me to paste-in addresses one at a time, just the
address - without having to input nicknames, fullnames etc. - this ver
doesn't seem to want to let me do this.

so... back to the short story....

I downloaded the .addressbook file in ascii mode via ftp and added a whole
bunch of addresses to it, following the same format  
(<somebody@somehwere.com>, <another@anotherplace.com>, ....... ) and sent
it back up, overwriting what was there....

now the buggah doesn't read right, within the addressbook function of pine....

this, after spending hours putting all the new addresses into it :(

anybody got any clues as to how to go about fixing this one?

TIA

That was a mistake...overwriting.

Take a very close look at the format of addresses that Pine makes in the
file. Emulate the format carefully.

Start by typing just one address directly into the file.

The folder is a single file in a directory called mail or Mail (U*ix is case
sensitive) in a directory /home/gundl. You can attach that file to a mail
which you then send to its "final destination". You could also save it to a
floppy though. Since that is dependant on your local configuration, you had
best talk to your sysadmin.

What do you mean by "journal"? A folder is a file containing e-mail messages.
You can use any means available to you: ftp, IMAP, zipping it and attaching it
to an e-mail message, etc.

If it's rather large, then use ftp or zip it and attach it to a message. I don't
know what tools you have.

I hope that you can help me.  I am in the process of moving Pine 3.96 from
a Digital Ultrix V4.4 system to a Digital Unix 4.0D system.  

When one of the users logs on, he gets the message "Error saving
configuration in file /usr/users/username/.pinerc permission denied".  I
have the same permissions on my own .pinerc file and my works just fine.
What could be causing this?

He also gets the message "Note: some of your config options conflict with
site policy and are ignored".  I am prompted to investigate when I attempt
to configure the setup.  The two offending options are: addrbook-sort-rule
and enable-suspend.  When I try to change these, I get the message "can't
change sys-admin defined value".  Please note that I copied his .pinerc
file from the old system to the new and he has a number of changes from the
supplied default.  

I have only started testing on the new machine with a few users and I am
very concerned if I cannot bring the users old .pinerc files to the new
system.

Thanks for your help.

Cathy Boll

Cathy,

It could be that the directory where the .pinerc lives has insufficient
write permissions.  Check this by typing:

cd /usr/users/username
ls -ld .

You should get a listing that looks something like:

drwxrwxrwx	18	root	other	20480	Jul 8 10:51 .

If any of the w's are missing, that's you're problem.  If not, it could
be that the username or id # is different on the new system, which would
disallow the user from updating the .pinerc file.  Make sure you assign
the same id #s to each user on the new system.

As for the message regarding site policy, that is being caused by the
presence of a pine.conf file in /usr/local/pine or whatever the equivalent
directory is on your Digital Unix system.  This file overrides whatever
is in the users .pinerc file.

What about the permissions of the parent directory?

Have you tried a different pinerc file using the -p flag?

Sounds like you have a /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed file on this new system

I know what 'enable-suspend' might be sorted off, but 'addrbook-sort-rule'  
shouldn't be set by the administrators.

Err?  Since when did any normal user's directory need to allow full 
write permission to everyone on the system?

I think a better example would be:

% ls -ld ~                                                                            0
drwx--x--x  46 edan     other      12288 Jul  8 16:43 /home/blah/edan/

If THAT 'w' is missing, then that's the problem, but that seems 
too easy.

I would be interested in what happens if you do

% cd
% touch afile
% pico afile  (write some stuff, quit)

If that doesn't work, then this isn't a pine problem.

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 4.00.  This release represents many months of work and introduces
significant new functionality.  Nearly every aspect of Pine's behavior has
seen enhancement in one way or another.

A reasonably detailed list of improvements can be found in the built-in
release notes ("R" off the Main Menu), and via:

        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine
and:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

As for performance expectations, note that this version has not been
exposed to widespread general use.  Due to the amount of new and revised
code, it is important that you carefully test and determine for yourself
that it performs suitably in your environment before placing it into
production use.

Source for the latest Pine release is available in: 

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.gz

and precompiled binaries for the various systems we have direct access to
are available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed

Unfortunately, PC-Pine cannot be made available at this time.  There
remains a small set of PC-specific enhancements not yet fully implemented
nor tested.  Please stay tuned!

As always, Thanks and Enjoy!

Sincerely,

The Pine Development Team

Hello !!!

I've already have some problems with Pine 4.00 :)

1. I always get this when I start pine:

Mailbox vulnerable - error creating
/var/spool/mail/ssdipola.lock.899977868.6153.alpha: Permission denied

What should I do???
--------

2. Why is pine creating .pine-debug*??? Is there a way how to prevent pine
from doing this???
--------
3. I have this in /usr/lib/pine.conf (main conf file)

global-address-book={/usr/lib/pine.addressbook}

but it doesn't work :(
---------

That's all for now!!!

Thank you to everyone who answered this request for help.  The .pinerc
problem was indeed caused by improper ownership of the /usr/users/username
directory and not down at the file level. 

The config problem is also resolved.  The user had an old .pinerc file that
used options that conflicted with the pine.conf file.

Again, thanks for your help.

Cathy Boll

I've read the online/context help, and I'm still not understanding.

How do I use ~/Unix/pine/mail/ rather than ~/mail/ ?

TjL, filing this under "non backwards compatible items"

Please tell if I should split it into separate messages next time.

1. I have Linux and glibc-2.0.7-13 and had to add -lcrypt manually to
   build pine.

2. Folder list, W something, ^X. This doesn't rearrange folder names
   correctly (as selecting with `:' does).

3. It would be nice if TAB TAB displayed possible completions for
   e.g. name of file to attach or insert, not only for folders.

4. When selectable items are in every line near the bottom of message,
   first DOWN key scrolls the text one line, second one selects the link
   that just appeared, third scrolls next line, fourth selects next link...
   So I think it would be more convenient if scrolling by one line
   selected the last link on that line as well (or first link, when
   scrollong up), so continuous scrolling would be more even.

5. When I am in postponed-msgs folder and attempt to continue postponed 
   composition, I get:
   [>Another Pine is accessing Inbox.  Session now Read-Only.<]
   Then some evil things may occur, e.g. garbage in that message.

6. If .signature file already begins with "-- ", pine should not add the
   second one. Some people may keep it there for other programs.

7. Pine could make links from email addresses without mailto: as well.

8. It would be nice if the string "On [someday], [somebody] wrote:" was
   configurable, wouldn't it?

9. Sometimes crossposts are deleted, sometimes not... Unfortunately now
   I can't detect and say exactly when. But one thing is obviously true:
   after unexclusion of a large newsgroup with `&' and then exiting it,
   smart enough program shouldn't have to examine all previously deleted
   messages for crossposts!

10. When you have time to think about improving a composer, I would
    suggest to start with writing a block to a file and piping a block
    through a command. Yes, I know I can attach an external editor, but
    it would not integrate with the rest of pine so nice :-)

11. I hope that the bugs I've told about, long time ago, to
    pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu, will be fixed sometime, as some of them
    still remain in version 4.00... I guess there is no need to repeat
    them here now, or am I wrong?

12. Is there a sense in telling about much larger wishes about pine?
    Unicode? Threading?

Thanks for pine, I found it the most convenient mailer and newsreader!
Version 4.00 is much better. But it still has bugs :-|

I may try to dig into sources and correct some of these bugs myself,
but unfortunately not until September.

I too am attempting to build under a glibc system- RedHat 5.0 with
glibc-2.0.7-13. I've tried a few things, and likely the large breakfast of
caffeine is clouding my memory, but- could you describe how you went about
adding -lcrypt manually? Also... there exist lnx, slx, and sl5
builds/ports for Linux... if using shadow passwords and glibc, am i
correct in assuming that i need to use slx to build?

Many, many thanks-

I compiled pine last night under FreeBSD 2.2.6 and now when I try to run
pine or pico I get the following:

ld.so failed: Undefined symbol "_timeo" in pine:pine

P.S. How much would someone need to pay for PGP support?

Edit ../src/pine4.0/pine/pine.h
add "int timeo;"

compile pico using "generic unix" type (it wouldnt compile w/ linux for
some reason, probably expects glibc2...)  Generic unix worked perfectly.

cd .../src/pine4.0/pico;make -f makefile.gen
cd .../src/pine4.0/pine;make -f makefile.lnx

.../src/pine4.0/pico/pico <--binary
.../src/pine4.0/pine/pine <--binary


This works for some, and doesn't work for others.  
If you haven't tried it, then it's worth it.  
If you have tried this, and it didn't work,  sorry, can't help ya.

Oops, slx works for me (I previously did lnx), SORRY!

I didn't ever know that slx exists, as there was only lnx in 3.96. Tried
lnx, got linker errors about crypt, remembered that glibc AFAIK moved
crypt into separate library, thought they maybe used some other glibc
version? added BASELDFLAGS="-lcrypt" into imap/src/osdep/unix/Makefile
under lnx and it worked. But it was my fault, as I should have read six
lines above where I added -lcrypt :-)

This Makefile says that slx is correct for glibc with shadow passwords.
I have no idea about your problems :-(

Ah, one more probable bug in pine: pine's Setup Newpassword looks for
/bin/passwd, and I have it in /usr/bin/passwd (from passwd-0.50-11.*.rpm).

	Hi--

	I've tried upgrading to 4.00 on my FreeBSD 2.2.6 system.
"build bsf" seems to compile everything correctly (no errors); however,
trying to run pine (or pico, or pilot), I get:

ld.so failed: Undefined symbol "_timeo" in pine:pine

	Has anyone been able to successfully build pine/4.00 for FreeBSD?
And how come there aren't any *-bin.bsf binaries on the ftp server? :)

	Thanks!

Brian

Sure.

Pine uses ~/mail to store mail.

I don't want to use that folder, I want to use ~/Unix/pine/mail (to keep my  
$HOME clean.... I'm one of those people who recompiles programs to use  
~/.commandline/whatever.rc rather than ~/.whatever.rc).  My .pinerc is also  
at ~/Unix/pine/pine.rc.

I can't seem to figure out how to tell PINE not to use ~/mail/ but use  
~/Unix/pine/mail/ so when I do something like:

pine -f active

I get ~/Unix/pine/mail/active instead of ~/mail/active.

Is that more clear?

OK, got it.  Try putting this in your .pinerc:

  folder-collections=~/Unix/pine/mail/[]

You can also set this from the Setup/Collections screen.

(~/mail is indeed Pine's default, and always has been, but you can tell
Pine to look in any directory or on remote IMAP servers to find folders.)

Subject: Trouble with imap on linux
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello

	Thanks a lot for bring out pine4.0. It is really good.

	I compiled it on HPUX10, HPUX9, and Linux.

	on all of then pine seems to be working fine. but imap does
not seem to be working on a linux machine. When i try to logon from
any machine, onto a linux machine, using imap (through pine) my login
fails. i have even downloaded the imapd-linux.bin.Z precompiled binary
from the distribution site, even that failed. However if i keep the
old imapd (which came along with pine3.96) everything works other than
saving a folder.

	could you please help me.

	thanks in advance.
niraj

Hi,

hmm, this is strange. It seems to work for me, although I can't 'talk'
imap (can anyone point me to a manual, please?). But it compiled fair
enough and I am at least able to connect via telnet. 

I've just tried to access my mailbox with pine(3.96) from another
machine with no troubles at all.

Norbert, wondering ...

Hmm, why I am getting this new "control" message in my mailboxes from
4.00. Can this be shut off? Or do I have to go back to good old 3.96 to
get rid of it. My wmmail constantly reports that I have 1 mail now even
though I have no "real" mail... very annoying...

The last version of Pico that I used came with Pine 3.96.  The new version
with Pine 4.00 is improved, even more improved than the FAQ indicates. The
last version of Pico would wrap lines that were more than 255 characters
long, even when wrap was turned of (using the -w command-line argument).
The FAQ at 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/changes/3.96-to-4.00.html

states that moving from 3.96 to 4.00...

 "Pico 255 character line length limit: wrap instead of truncate"

Actually, I just turned off wrap and brought in a line that was thousands
of characters long, and Pico didn't wrap it at 255, it kept the full long
line intact.

Hallelujah!

Just after Pine 4.00 was released, we were made aware of a security
problem with the imapd server that is included in the Pine 4.00
distribution. This will be fixed in the Pine 4.01 maintenance release, but
in the mean time, if you are using the UW IMAP server, please update it
with the following distribution:

   ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

We don't have new imapd binaries available yet.  
Pine itself is not affected.

Hello

	I had earlier posted a problem that i faced trying to access
my mail on a Linux machine from anyother machine, using pine4.0 and
imap4.0.

	i have now compile imap-4.1-FINAL and that fails too... 

	both of them just keep asking my for my passwd and this
process repeats itself till it login fails. It then gives me that
error that Authentication failed.

	please help me. thanks in advance.

Hi all, :)

Is there a FAQ or archive of past questions? Got it! Thanks. pine-info.

Newbie here, and have read all of the help files locally for Pine 3.96
QUESTION:

  I have a list of people in my address book, in a distribution listing,
IS THERE A QUICK WAY TO TURN OFF THE "TO:" so that each reciepient doesn't
get flooded with the 30-50 other TO: listers names?
-------------------
Hope this makes sense.. Rather than have screen-fulls of TO:names@domains
etc, in the header of each e-mail, I would think one could just have TO:
or CC: "Entire X group, Full list NOT DISCLOSED" then message somehow.

How?

Thanks in advance.

If "Lcc" is part of the answer, I only get a CC: in my forward to header,
how does one turn on Lcc??

Subject: bug/enhancement request in PINE 4.00 w.r.t.
 compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I am just trying PINE 4.00, and I would like
to suggest that the following is a bug.

after enabling the feature
            [X]  compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs     

I typed in fred2 into the To: field
and got the following error:

 [ To field: Address for "fred2" not in addressbook ]

Since this used to do what I wanted I disabled the
feature, and typed in the fred2 again.

This time it expanded to the full user name 
  To      : Fred Moore <fred2@tc.fluke.com>

I have multiple address books, so when I type ^T I get a
menu

   PERSONAL
        Personal AddressBook in .addressbook

    ECS
        Personal AddressBook in /apps/general/lib/email/ecs_wbook
 

and one of them I inherited from our IT folks to support people that
are using ECS mail.  When I search for fred2 in the ECS book I find

igc#    Moore, Fred      fred2@tc.fluke.com


Since fred2 does get expanded from an address book to 
    Fred Moore <fred2@tc.fluke.com>
it would be nice to see it work the same when the
compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs feature is enabled

I can see that the definition/help file for this feature indicates
that the unqualified name must match a nickname, but perhaps
you could also allow it to search the address book for
the user-name@user-domain, (my user-domain is set to "tc.fluke.com")

Would this break the intend of the compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs,
since the user-name that I desired was in one of my address books?

I acknowledge that I could write a tool to 'fix' the ECS address
book, to change the nicknames to not be the machine generated garbage
the IT needed to use to allow for the general case, but setting the
nickname to the user name when there was no conflict, but it
just seemed that since the users full name was in my address book
and it did get expanded correctly when the compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs 
feature was disabled I expected it to still work.

I'm not asking for this to work when the user name gets expanded
because it was in a password file, just when it is found in the
address book.
Thanks for your thoughts....

  David Dyck

Subject: help with .lock files on Linux!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-7
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello and greetings from Greece,
I have compiled Pine 4.0 for a Linux system and I have the following
problem:
When I run it it tries to create the .lock file in the /var/spool/mail
directory
but it has no access there and I don't think it would be a great idea to
give
write access to everyone in that directory. So it gives me a warning
that the
inbox is vulnerable etc. etc. because it couldn't create the .lock file.

Also, I get an e-mail from mailer-deamon, when I issue the frm command I

get this:
Mail System Internal Data  DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE -- FOLDER INTERNAL
DATA
This happens everytime I try to run Pine 4.0 so I still use an older
version.
What I would like to know is how can anyone tell pine to create its
.lock files
in another directory such as the /tmp directory where it will have no
problems.
I searched every page I could find, found a lot of info on .lock files
but I was
unable to find a way to tell pine where to store those files.
Thanx a lot for any help!

I'm having the same problem as you. As you already told, this can only be
fixed that you add your user to mail group or enable write permission for
everyone.

This is also a bad feature of Pine 4.00 IMHO and annoying. There are some
great features, but some are really buggy (lock file, "don't delete this
mail etc.") So my best answer to your question would be to uninstall Pine
4.00 and install Pine 3.96 (or any version you prefer), because we have
to wait that all these problems would be fixed in 4.05 (I can just hope).

Hello !!!

I've searched the Pine 4.00 features, but I didn't found anything about
compressing mail folders (saved-messages etc.)
Will be this included in new version of pine???
Tnx!
								Bye.

Last night I upgraded from pine 3.96 to pine 4.00, and now I can
not read/access any of the news groups I am active on which are
in my /~.newsrc file.  I run my own news server (INN-2.0), with a
small selection of newsgroups.  I have been unable to access it
by any means using pine 4.00.  Could someone please tell me how
to restore my news folder to the way it was setup in pine 3.96.

It was dissapointing to add an address to my address book and see that it
was stuck into the list at essentially a random point.  A section of the
address book is shown here:

bgaserv	BGA Network listserv	Majordomo@bga.org
bgnews	BGNews	bgnews@taxa.psyc.missouri.edu
michelle	Niemeyer, Michelle	psymn@showme.missouri.edu
ziggy	Bialzik, Ziggy	zigzag@macc.wisc.edu
laurabie	Bierut, Laura	laura@newhar.wustl.edu

The names beginning with B were already there in proper alphabetical
order, but I added Niemeyer, Michelle, and she was shoved into the Bs
instead of the Ns.  The rest of the list is alphabetized by "full name",
so why not the new entry?  I tried quitting and restarting and it's still
there.

I think that qualifies as a bug, unless there is some new option I have to
set.

Why does the new version of Pine add a message like the following to the
beginning of every folder? (I added the '>'s along the left so as not to
confuse your mailer.)

What will happen if I do delete it?  What is it doing?  It sounds so
dangerous and it looks so useless.  I know that it changes every time I
make a change to a folder.  I find it very unappealing.  Do I need to have
this?  It makes it so that everytime I login, my computer reports "you
have mail" even when this invisible (in Pine) message is the only one I
have.  So I hope it's doing something I really want.

If I go in and edit some part of the folder using some kind of editor,
will that make for some conflict of the folder with its lead message?
Will it cause problems?

Scared in Missouri,   :-)

I can't give you a definitive answer, but I can tell you a little.
I first saw the above message when I was playing with the UW IMAP
server a few months ago.  And given the X-IMAP header, it seems
pretty obvious that they are related.

I believe (since I haven't examined the c-client code much)
that this is part of how Pine can set the Answered flaged on
postponed messages.  If you were to look at your mailbox
now, you'd note that Pine has started adding a couple more headers
to all of your messages.  One of them is an X-UID header, which I
assume Pine uses to find the message you were originally replying
to.

My guess is that the X-IMAP header in the message you've quoted
contains

  X-IMAP: 0900019774 0000000063
	  ---------- ----------
a timestamp   |		 |
			 |
a msg uid number --------|


I would guess the timestamp had something to do with the last
modification time on the folder, and the UID is the last message
UID given out.  For instance, in my mailbox the second number is
380 and the last message has X-UID: 380 ... coincidence?  I think
not :)

I don't know what else it's used for.  I would guess that
if you deleted at most you might find it annoying--pine4 
would recreate it, and any information you would have lost
would likely only be "annoying" and not serious :)

I hope this helped, somewhat.

The wrong way is to post an off-topic message like this and annoy everyone on
the list. You didn't even bother to change the Subject!

The right way is to take a look at the headers and figure out which list server
is used. 

As you can see, it's ListProc. So, send a command to listproc@u.washington.edu.
Don't know what the commands are? Send a help command.

Commands are sent in the BODY of a message, only one per line left justified. 
Delete your .sig. Leave the Subject blank.

The command is

	set pine-info mail postpone

To resume

	set pine-info mail

To learn about the set command

	help set

See the Sender in the headers? That's the address of a person. If you have
trouble, contact the list owner at that address. Never post questions like this
to this or any other mailing list.

I have searched the docs and the Pine online help and looked in the
config. I can't find any option to turn off this devil's invention "FOLDER
INTERTAL DATA". It's screwing up all my other mail applications. Why must
Pine 4.00 do this. I thought that when I upgraded I would get a better
product. Now it looks like I have to go back to 3.96...
Can anyone enlighten me if I missed anything... Please!!!

And if cat two folders together, what happens? Now the second 'pseudo'-mail
DOES show up in pine. Which one does pine use? Can I delete the second one?
What should be the policy on the second one? Should pine delete it automatically?
Should pine tell me I have a 'corrupt' folder?

(sigh)

1. Pine sometimes splits References line in the middle of Message-ID!
   Example:

References: <Pine.LNX.3.96.980702162445.1897A-100000@qrnik.knm.org.pl>
 <359C917D.69FC@orient.uw.edu.pl> <Pine.LNX.3.96.980703113130.659A-100000@q

 <Pine.LNX.3.96.980707173250.8713F-100000@qrnik.knm.org.pl>
 <6o31tl$iv0$4@kerigma.cyf.gov.pl>

2. Pine makes a link from a simple word "www" or "wwww", which obviously
   can't be a web address.

3. The option enable-exit-via-lessthan-command seems to be ignored.

4. Pine no longer shows "to: name.of.a.newsgroup" instead of "My Name".
   It works only for emails.

   Anyway, this useful behavior is often confusing for beginners. I think
   it might be better documented? Or, as they generally don't read the
   documentation (asking on news:*.linux instead), maybe it could be a
   switchable option, off by default.

5. Subjects in a newsgroup seem to be sorted before MIME-unescaping
   (at least with OrderedSubj sort), putting =?ISO-8859-2?Q?Something?=
   far away from Something.

Have you tried making the pine executable SGID (set GID) mail ? This
would allow the pine program to write to /var/spool/mail, but not the
user separate from pine.

I have been using the Sun IMAP server for months, accessing it with both
Pine (3.96) and Netscape Messenger. The IMAP server creates these
entries for internal housekeeping, and does not appear to serve them out
to the mail client.

I have deleted them as well as concatenated multiple files (folders)
together without any ill effects (except perhaps a small performance hit
as the IMAP server re-generates them).

If these entries are being generated in LOCAL mail spool files, I
suggest that Pine 4.0 is using IMAP internally to access these files.
(just my guess based on observations and comments made to this list).

I was actually planning on adopting Pine 4.0, but have not had the time
yet.

Question is now: How do I turn of this unwanted "feature".

Can you be more specific?

Why does it trouble you so? Can't your other applications ignore it?
Which applications are having problems?

This could indeed work, but...  the user could technically do a shell
escape from Pine and delete other people's mail, something you would not
be able to do when the directory permissions are set to 1777.  A public
writable directory with the sticky bit on REALLY isn't as bad as some
people think!

By the way, switching back to Pine 3.96 or earlier does NOT help, since
these releases require the same semantics to work properly.  The only
difference is that they don't show you the error message, something you
can resemble in Pine 4.00 by enabling quell-lock-failure-warnings in the
configuration setup.  Be warned, though, that you're living dangerously if
you do.  But if you lived happily that way in Pine 3.96...

Regards,

- Richard.

No.

wmmail, BitchX, asmail, and all other programs that tells you if you got
mail. These now tell me that I got one mail. Ok I can ignore it, but it's
annoying when I don't want it. I want to see the "No Mail" icon instead of
the spinning letter. Also BitchX (IRC client) tells me that I got one
unread mail waiting all the time. I don't think I want to patch all these
program just because Pine insist on having that stupid INTERNAL DATA.

There's been a ton of discussion on comp.mail.pine and in the mailing list since
the new version was released. Just read the messages for information.

I don't believe you that it's screwing up other mail applications, given that
it's formatted like an ordinary mail message. Can you demonstrate this?

This is an old "trick", but it is very vulnerable AFAIK!

pine 4 uses a Mail "DONT DELETE THIS..." in the Inbox.
unfortunatly this means that a user will get the message
"you have mail" when loging in.

Right now I want to expand the relevant login-script
to check not only for mail, but if there is mail check
if the last (and only) mail in the inbox is the pine-info-mail
and then print out a message ...

Does anyone know a better solution ?
Has someone written something like that ?

(I have searched the list archives but found nothing on this
subject)

Please mail answers to me, I will post a summary.

Thanks,
Sebastian Benoit

There is a problem with the FreeBSD version of pico. ffclose causes the
errore message "Error preparing to close file: Invalid arguement" to be
displayed frequently.

I notice on usenet others are reporting the same problem under BSDi. 

One person has posted a patch for this but it seems to me that it is just
commenting out the if statement that generates the message which would not
seem to be a completely wise thing to do.

If no one has found a solution to this I guess the only thing to do is to
fall back to 3.96.

On another topic, the documentation should be beefed up a bit in regards
to proper access perms for the mail spool directory and specifically to
FreeBSD a note should be made about the libpico.so.1.3 file needing to be
moved inot a system lib directory.

Mike,
  Try looking at the variable "addrbook-sort-rule" in the Setup/Config
screen. If it is set to "dont-sort" that would explain it. Otherwise, we
may have a bug of some sort.

This, I believe, is a valid point.  There are performance implications as
well. 

I wonder why UW-IMAP doesn't use a separate companion file to track the
info in that "INTERNAL DATA" mail message.  The UW IMAP4 server versions
that use this format are considerably slower when batch storing messages. 
I suspect (but definitely have NOT proven!)  that the internal data
rewriting is involved.

Can anyone enlighten me/us on this?

Thanks.

Thanks for pointing me to comp.mail.pine, I had forgotten
about it.

I have used pine for quite a while now, but it is not
the only way I access my email.

I don't like the FOLDER INTERNAL DATA message

  I could perhaps learn to live with it if the message
   were more descriptive.  
     When I first encountered the message, I couldn't
     determine 'who' put it in my mailbox.

        I would like the message to include 
          "This message placed in you inbox by Pine 4.00" as this would
        have helped me determine where the message was comming from.

        I would like the message to include a pointer to the technical
        documentation, a web page or some specification that stated in
        more detail why the header was there, and what would happen if
        it were deleted, and how it was being used...

        I would like to have this message documented in the technical
        documentation, as I couldn't find any reference to this user
        visable change anywhere in the technical documentation.

        I to would like to be able to turn of the message, or is
        pine itself using the data in the header - since the documention
        doesn't stated that it is used by pine, and it's off in
        the imap side of the sources, and I access my mailbox as
        a mailbox file over NFS, I couldn't determine in a few minutes
        if it was really required.

after scanning comp.mail.pine I see a few people that state
that the MUA shouldn't be accessing the spool file, but
that is what I have been doing for ages, and have been
successful without this cryptic message.

Just for comparison, here is what the Sun IMAP server puts at the head
of our mail files :

sims is Solstice Internet Mail Server (Sun's product name)

I wonder if the X-IMAP information is transportable amoung IMAP servers
?

I got this by head'ing my mail file. I use IMAP to access it so I never
see thin in my mail client (the server never serves it out).

	Hi...

	At some point during the beta cycle of 4.0, I asked whether a
feature was in the works for deleting attachments from messages while
keeping the messages themselves. The reason I'd love this feature is that
sometimes people send me large files, accompanied by text, and I want to
use the file and get it out of my inbox so it isn't so huge-- and yet be
able to reply to the text later, at my leisure. I was assured that this
feature was planned for 4.0, much to my pleasure.

	So, now it's out, and it seems that the "Delete attachment"
feature only applies to saving the messages to other folders-- it doesn't
do anything to delete the attachment out of the mail spool itself. This
sort of ignores what I thought was the whole point of the feature.

	Is there a particular reason why it's being implemented this way?
Is there the possibility that full deletion of attachments might be a part
of a later release?

	Please don't take this as a complaint or a demand for more from a
free software effort. :) I greatly appreciate the hard work that the pine
developers have put into 4.00, and I applaud the ongoing project. Thanks!

Brian

I've seen those as well and can't fathom why they think that should be the
case. Its a fallacy as far as I can tell.

No.

> Which applications are having problems?

wmmail, BitchX, asmail, and all other programs that tells you if you got
mail. These now tell me that I got one mail. Ok I can ignore it, but it's
annoying when I don't want it. I want to see the "No Mail" icon instead of
the spinning letter. Also BitchX (IRC client) tells me that I got one
unread mail waiting all the time. I don't think I want to patch all these
program just because Pine insist on having that stupid INTERNAL DATA.
------------------------

I'm running 3.96, so I can't try this, but has anyone tired just V/reading
the message and leaving it alone? (or even "A"nswer it) and not deleting
it to stop your spinning letter? 

bandaid on a broken arm I know if it works <g>
just hopeful thinking i guess :)

I do have it set to sort by full names.  In fact, all other entries are
sorted by full name.  So it's just the one I added.

If it helps any, I added the addressbook entry using the "take" command.

OK, this I believe, but it's a pain in the neck, not a screw-up.

The following explanation is adapted from the one I send to users on a
regular basis when they pose the same question in Helpdesk e-mail (we
recently upgraded to IMAP on Pine3.96):

"Pine has recently been set up to use IMAP protocol to access your
INBOX.  The IMAP server likes to have a "MAIL SYSTEM internal data file" in
each users INBOX. When you use IMAP/pine you will not see this message
displayed in your INBOX index listing.  Even though you can't see
it, your system will probably tell you about it - either with a
'You have new mail' message when your INBOX appears empty, or with
a 'You have x messages' (which turns out to be x-1).

Here at the U of A, the login process likes to check the /var/spool/mail
file system to see if you have any mail. Because we have
/var/spool/mail NFS mounted, you get told you have mail (ie. the
MAIL SYSTEM internal data file).

If you're using non-IMAPed e-mail software, like Eudora or Netscape, this
message will continue to appear.  It's not a real message, and when you
delete it it's not really deleted - the non-IMAP software is simply able to
see it, whereas if you open your e-mail in Pine (which is IMAPed), the
message will not be visible."

I hope the above is some help as far as explanation is concerned...

It explains it but it really doesn't justify it. Not that thats your job:)

The imap daemon really should not be doing things like this with the inbox
imo. By definition its for mail, data regarding mail should be kept else
where. Many many users use multiple applications which interact with this
file, its a bit arogent for pine's stuff to assume otherwise. If this is a
defined, required part of imap than perhaps imap users should use a
seperate mail spool directory and be made aware of this quirk.

Right! I been browsing the source tonight a bit trying to see if it's easy
to get rid of this behavior. No luck yet finding it. If anyone has a patch
that removes this feel free to send it my way.

I added "Miller, Mike" to my address book with the Take command,
and it was added out-of-order.  I changed addrbook-sort-rule to
by nickname, then back to fullname, and the sort order was correct.

Hello all,

I have a (strange) problem with pine 4.00 on my BSDI 3.1 box. Whem i am
editing a message every once in a while pine reports the error "preparing
to close file: invalid argument" and it freezes for a few seconds. I can
continue typing and sending messages..

The newsgroup didn't have any answers, so maybe the list has one?

BTW somebody also had the problem on a BSDI 2.1 box according to his
posting.

Greetings and thanks for any replies,

Hugo

Hello everyone.  I have just upgreaded from 3.96 to 4.0.  All of the users =
have a mail.txt file in their home directories.  If a user has say 120 =
messages in tehre inbox in 3.96, they load 4.0 and see only the 4 new =
messages in the inbox.  The other 120 are there, but they can't see them.  =
I have gone back to 3.96 and all of the mail in the inboxes is there.  Any =
ideas??
Thanks,
Paul Yahnig

I noticed the following minor error with Pine 4.00 built on a

'<' command in FOLDER LIST gives the error 
[Command "<" not defined for this screen. Use ? for help]

Goto the List Folders window, goto the NNTP server window, add  
comp.mail.pine.... select, post

Don't ask that on the newsgroup..... really..... it won't be happy.

Read the FAQ at http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/index.html

It's the fifth entry.

Subject: Bug opening folders in subdirectories ?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Cc: Warren Jones <wjones@tc.fluke.com>
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've run into what looks like a bug in the way Pine 4.00 handles
folder collections with subdirectories.  To reproduce:

    1. Define *two* local folder collections.

    2. The *second* collection in your folder
       list should include a subdirectory.

    3. Go to your folder list ("L").

    4. Select the second folder collection.

    5. Select a subdirectory.

    6. Attempt to open a mail folder in the subdirectory.

    7. Pine reports: [Can't open mailbox ... no such folder]

But if you shuffle your folder list so that the collection with
a subdirectory comes first, pine will open a folder in the
subdirectory without any complaint!  Here's an example:

My .pinerc file defines two folder collections ...

    folder-collections="ECS mail folders" private/mail/folders/[],
	               "Unix mail folders" mail/[]

The second collection (mail/[]) contains a subdirectory named "apps".
In that subdirectory, there is a folder named "cscope".  When I go
to the "mail/apps" subdirectory, the screen looks like this:

    Local folders in mail/
    Dir: apps/
    <folders shown here>
    Now in directory: mail/apps/

When I select the "cscope" folder, I get this message:

   [ Can't open mailbox  mail//tekoa/usr7/wjones/mail/apps/cscope:
     no such folder ]

(My HOME directory is "/tekoa/usr7/wjones".)

Here's an excerpt from .pine-debug1:

	---- FOLDER LISTER ----
  About to open folder "/tekoa/usr7/wjones/mail/apps/cscope"    inbox: "INBOX"
  Close - saved inbox state: max 4
  IMAP 09:14:23 7/14 mm_log ERROR:
  Can't open mailbox mail//tekoa/usr7/wjones/mail/apps/cscope: no such mailbox

"About to open" shows the correct folder.  Somewhere between there
and "Can't open mailbox", the folder path has been munged.

When I shuffle my folder list so that "mail/[]" comes first,
I can open "mail/apps/cscope" without any problem.

I've observed the same behavior under both Solaris 2.5 and Red Hat
Linux 4.1.  Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Hello !!!

I've found another bug in Pine 4.00.
If you have in your Setup/Config something like this:

read-message-folder      = ~/mail/saved-messages

and if you go then in a shell and in a directory "~/mail" you'll see a
directory called "home", then "your username", then "mail" and final the

My version of Pine 4 does not make a link from "www" but it DID make
one from "wwww."  In fact, if you have enable-web-host-scan set,
words like

WWWServers Inc

will get a link.  The attached patch enforces "www." as well 
as "web." which was already there.

It also makes news:*.linux a link.  That's kind of dumb too, and I
don't currently understand why Pine considers characters like '*'
an acceptable RFC1738 "EXTRA" character.  I suppose I could 
read the rfc...  bleah.  :)

similar to this, I used to read mail in other directories
by starting pine with

  pine -f $PWD/file.in.this.directory

and it would open the file as I desired

This doesn't work any more.

I did notice in the pine manual that:

       -f folder           Open  folder  (in first defined folder
                           collection) instead of INBOX.

it mentions the _first_ folder collection.  I wonder if
this is related to your problem.

David,
Try adding -c 0 to the argument list.
This tells Pine to interpret the -f argument as file system path,
rather than a name understood in the primary folder collection context.

(I don't think this solves Warren's problem however, which looks
suspiciously like a bug to me.)

Hmm, I would regard this not as a bug, but as the default behaviour of
pine. The default directory wherein your mail-folders, which are
_files_, are stored is '~/mail'. Now, you name your saved-messages
folder as '~/mail/saved-messages'. If the programme is allowed to
create the subdirectory structure (it obviously is :) it will create
them. Therefore, just use the file name 'saved-messages' as folder
name.

Thanks for your very quick reply.   Your suggestion was what I needed.

Perhaps this can be documented in the manual, as I would never
have guessed to add -c 0.

Maybe someone could suggest a way to interpret the man page
that would allow others to deduce this usefull information.

       -c context-number   context-number is  the  number  corre-
                           sponding  to  the folder-collection to
                           which the  -f  command  line  argument
                           should  be applied.  By default the -f
                           argument  is  applied  to  the   first
                           defined folder-collection.

Dave,

PS. I still needed to add the $PWD/ preceding the file name.

Hi!

I recently installed pine-4.00 and since then cannot save a specific kind
of message from any mailbox into any other due to 'message shrunk'!

Those mewssages always were formerly created by the broken version
of the Sun-CDE-Program 'dtmail', which did introduce ^M (Carriage Return)
in strategically important places :-)

So those mails viewed binary look like
--------------------------------------
From: user@domain
To: me^M@mydomain
Subject: text^M
------^^--------- see middle line ---!!!

(The dumb MOTIF-Widget took the 'Return' from the user into the String
 when it added the default-domainname!)

When I see those Messages on the display I get
----------------------------------------------
From: user@domain
To: me@mydomain
@mydomain
Subject: text
------------------
(OOPS! extra line)

And when I save I get the 'message #... shrunk' message
and so I cannot 'work' with pine-4.00 :-(

Does anybody have a idea/patch to avoid this situation ?
(possibly avoiding re-editing of about 50 large archives :-)

Stucki

I can't find the answer to this in tech-notes or anything, so I thought I
would ask here. I tried to create a shared global address book for staff,
and it *works*, but every time someone accesses it, they get an error
message saying that they can't create global.addressbooks.lu, so a temp
file will be used.

Why on earth, if the global address book is supposed to be read only,
would pine even be *trying* to create a lookup file for the global address
book? There is already one there, and individual users have no need to
write to it, so why is this happening? Mysterious error messages have a
way of alarming people...

Hi,

it plainly tells you why. The amount of hard-disk space assigned to you
is at its end.

Look through your files, archive and remove them. Or ask your System
Administrator to get a higher quota.

Remember, the path assumed is relative to the default directory for saving
folders. So, if that's ~/mail, pine would look for the folder or collection
here.

I don't see how pine could find the collections relative to $PWD.

Hi Bob,

   you need to create the .lu file ONCE. And then pine will be happy.
So you need to recreate this file, every time the global addressbook is
changed.
Try 'man pine' and look for the parameter '-create_lu'.

Cheers,

   Florian

You're not seeing the point.  Some of us have files with mail in them
in other places.

Under 3.96
 
	% pine -f $PWD/folder

would open the folder in the current directory.

Under 4.00

	% pine -f $PWD/folder

pines does what you're suggesting, and tries to look for 
~/Mail/$PWD/folder.

In my opinion, that is dumb.  Pine should not try to find a relative
path when it's given an absolute one.  Sure, make it so that users
don't have to understand how directories work.  But if they try
to get tricky, let them fail or succeed the way one would expect it
to work, I say.

Yes,

	% pine -c 0 -f $PWD/folder

works, but that seems like a pain.  I think a better behavior would
be to assume '-c 0' when foldernames starts with '/' or "./" so that
I don't have to type as much.  :)

Ok, I won't get this to work, and it's probably some syntax error or I am
totally misunderstanding this feature.

I have an extra incoming folder nicked 'pine-info' sitting in
~/mail/lists/pine-info (that's fed via procmail):

incoming-folders=pine-info mail/lists/pine-info

This folder 'by itself' works perfectly.

But I want the read messages from '~/mail/lists/pine-info' to be auto-moved to
an archive folder '~/mail/lists/pine-info-archived':

incoming-archive-folders = mail/lists/pine-info mail/lists/pine-info-archived

                      [X]  auto-move-read-msgs

I don't have 'read-message-folder' set, because I don't want this feature
for other folders.

Are these settings correct? Because it doesn't work. I also tried prefixing
a ~/ but this didn't work either. When I leave the 'mail/lists/pine-info'
folder (by opening INBOX for example) I get the status 'Closing folder
pine-info, keeping 303 messages' and the messages are not moved.

I tried 'pine -d 9' but it doesn't give me anything.

Any help would be appreciated.

Florian,
I haven't tried using the syntax you did, with the absolute path for the
source folder, so there may be a bug there... but I use this form, with
the nickname of the source folder, successfully:

incoming-archive-folders = IMAP imap-arch
                           IMAPEXT imapext-arch
                           PINE pine-arch
                           PINE-INFO pine-info-arch
                           PINE-SUGGESTIONS pine-sug-arch

The address book problem has gotten even stranger. Someone suggested that
I try the -create_lu option, but the error still occurs. Then I noticed
this: If I launch pine as root at the console, then press A to enter the
address book, then press return to enter the personal address book, the
message I see at the bottom is the same error, only now referring to the
personal address book:
 [Can't write in directory containing .addressbook.lu, using temp file]

But the directory containing root's .addressbook.lu is /, which is
definitely writable by root. Why would this be the case, how is this
related to the global addressbook problem?

Thanks,

Does anyone have a patch to take out the following information from the Message-ID?

IE rather than this:

<Pine.LNX.3.96.980715111116.17030A-100000@domainnamehere>

I would like this:

<980715111116.17030A-100000@domainnamehere>

I don't feel any need to share the rest of the information with the rest of  
the world.

I'm not sure how to patch it myself, after lookin at the code.  I can hack  
the binary itself, but I'd rather have a working patch,

Anyone have one?

All right. I could have added, "unless I cd to the directory containing the
collection," but I didn't. I don't care to do that each time I invoke pine
so I specify the relative path.

It does appear that pine is ignoring an environment variable. I assume you
verified that nothing else changed that would prevent this from being passed on
to pine.

>Pine should not try to find a relative path when it's given an absolute one.

Er, if I am relying on variable expansion, am I not by definition specifying a
relative path? It's only an absolute path if I specify it from root.

I'm trying to compile Pine 4.00 under Solaris 2.5 on a Sparc10 using gcc
version 2.7.2.2.

All packages compile just fine except Pine itself.  During the build I
get the following output:

pine.o: In function 'main':
/opt/imports/src/mail/pine4.00/pine/pine.c:220: undefined reference to
'srandom'

make: *** [pine] Error 1
size: bin/pine: no such file or directory


I'm running build as 'build gs5' as listed in the tech-notes, without
any options or flags.  Any ideas what's going on here?

Many thanks in advance,
   ---steve

No, I'm talking about when I'm IN a directory that contains a folder
that I wish to view.  I want to say 

    % pine -f ./folder

And not have Pine run off and open ~/Mail/./folder

Eh?  Ka-peesh?

Ah, I see for my example I should have said

    % echo $PWD
    /home/somewhere/edan/directory
    % pine -f $PWD/folder

Pine will try to open ~/Mail//home/somewhere/edan/directory/folder

THAT'S dumb!

Er, no.  If I enter

    % pine -f $PWD/folder

Pine doesn't know I typed $PWD, right?  I'm not expecting pine to do 
anything fancy.  When I give Pine a folder that starts with "./" or
"/" I want it to realize I am specifying an absolute path.

I will probably code it myself since I doubt its on the priority
list of the Pine developers, particularly since "-c 0" makes
it work that way.

Remember that the folder collection contexts can specify remote IMAP
servers as well as local filesystem paths. The -c flag is needed to
over-ride the default context, otherwise Pine would not know whether you
are referring to /foo/bar on the IMAP server or /foo/bar on the local
host.

A more reasonable criticism would be that in the case of a local default
context, a path beginning with / should successfully break out of the
context without needing the -c 0...  And we would agree, but it turns out
that there is a bug in that case.

I have the following spec:

incoming-folders="pine-faq-mail" filtered-incoming-mail/pine-faq-mail
      ...
incoming-archive-folders=pine-faq-mail sav-pine/pine-faq-mail
      ...

where filtered-incoming-mail is  in $HOME and sav-pine in $HOME/mail.
The folders in filtered-incoming-mail are maintained by procmail.
Hope this helps.

After compiling Pine 4.0 on a Linux, I have noticed that the
following message is created by imapd in each folder I visit :

 From MAILER-DAEMON Thu Jul 16 10:34:08 1998
 Date: Thu, 16 Jul 1998 10:34:08 +0200 (CEST)
 From: Mail System Internal Data <MAILER-DAEMON@wanadoo.fr>
 Subject: DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE -- FOLDER INTERNAL DATA
 X-IMAP: 0900578028 0000000008
 Status: RO

 This text is part of the internal format of your mail folder, and is not
 a real message.  It is created automatically by the mail system software.
 If deleted, important folder data will be lost, and it will be re-created
 with the data reset to initial values.

This may well be a normal default behavior. What is some what annoying for
me is that the same message gets created also in my INBOX folder
(/var/mail/junichi) so each time I log in, I now see a message saying 'You
have mail' even if there is in fact no real message there. 

I would like to know how I can disable this feature.

Hi!

Sorry, but I believe we'll have to forget pine...
Use 'pop3' add 'ssh' for security, or use the combination
of SSL and POP3 for security and simply forget pine.

Our users are complaining about that 'forever-1-mail'
too, and as pine4 is broken anyway, we'll have to switch
to 'mutt' and 'pop'.

Stucki (irritated admin and postmaster, using mutt from now on)

Greetings,

I'm using PC Pine and it's working quite well except for one annoying
problem:  I can't access my personal and global addressbooks.  If I
login to my smtp server directly and run Unix Pine, no problem.  All
other operations in PC Pine work perfectly.

The error I get is: "No addressbook operations are possible".

Is it me?

Joe

To conclude:

The setting 'incoming-archive-folders' holds a comma-separated (?) list of
pairs, the two values in a pair being separated by a blank.

The FIRST value in a pair is the NICKNAME of an incoming folder as specified
in the setting 'incoming-folders'.

Is this the only way??? Is it is, it should be pointed out the only help
for this setting!

The SECOND value in a pair is the name of the folder file relative to
~/mail, if a relative path is specified (or other ways of specifying a
folder are probably possible).

Thanks to Rudolf Kompf and Terry Gray for replying.

It will either require that the folks working on pine pull it violently
out of the pine code or modify login, finger, all pop3 and imap servers,
emacs, elm, mail, mailx, and possible fetchmail.  I'm probably missing
some.  Which is more feasable?  The first message in the folder isn't a
bad idea but not in inbox eh.

I'm not sure abandoning pine is necessary.  All programs have bugs.  If
there is a bug in sendmail, you don't necessarily stop using it.  I do
think it would be a good idea if there was a patch made available to pull
it out before the release of pine 4.01 because many systems do use pine
and I'm sure it's causing alot of havoc out there.  I looked at the code
and it looks very difficult to pull out.  I don't think it's as easy as
just pulling out the fprintf lines that are responsible.

the following message doesn't pass the url directly to exec,
 or quote the argument.

my guess is it gets passed directly to system.

there is room for improvement in this area, as I couldn't even
pass a simple argument ('-n') to the program I wanted to invoke
either.

I'd suggest if pine is going to check that the program exists,
and it knows it wasj just passed the url, that it 
  fork and exec with the args already parsed (like perl's
     system "prog", "arg1", "arg2"; #....

I have 1 read message in INBOX and several messages in my
read-message-folder=sav-inbox/saved-messages.

If I go into the read-message-folder, delete 1 message and then quit pine,
the following dialog appears:

Really quit pine?        Y
Expunge 1 deleted message from "sav-inbox/saved-messages"?    Y
Closing "sav-inbox/saved-messages"...Save the 1 read message in
sav-inbox/saved-messages?    Y
Error saving to sav-inbox/saved-messages. Not all messages moved.


And now the message from INBOX is duplicated:
  - Saved to sav-inbox/saved-messages
  - Remains in INBOX

The .pine-debug1 ends with the following lines:

    ---- QUIT SCREEN ----

Some of our users read their mail with both PINE and POP3 clients. 
Occasionally they've been getting the message below in their POP3
mailbox.  So far it has just been an annoyance, but I'm wondering if
this is at all bad.  Are we setting ourselves up for errors down the
road like lost message folders, etc.?

Thanks in advance,

When setting ^j (justification), Pine sets the line width to a 
pre-determined length.  How can this length be changed, permanently?

I have pine aliased to launch and not create debug files via the
'/usr/local/bin/pine -d0' command.  This is in the manpage, and probably
in the FAQ.

The name of the option is composer-wrap-column. When using pico as a text
editor, invoke it with "-r[some number]". See the context-sensitive help and
the pico man page for more information.

So there are Pine and Pico man pages.  Here's what I want to know:  Where
can I get the man pages?  I've looked all over, believe me.  I found some
text documents, but not true man pages.

Thanks,

Subject: changing X-sender in header
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-To: PINE-INFO list <pine-info@cac.washington.edu>
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm attempting to signoff from a mailing list and I'm having a problem.
The computer I'm subscribed from has two names, and I'm subscribed under
one of those names.  When I change my user-domain to the name I'm
subscribed under, you'd think the listserv program would let me signoff.
It doesn't.  The reason, apparently, is that there is another line in the
header called x-sender that gives the other name of the computer.
Listserv notices this, ignores the From: field, and tells me that I'm not
subscribed, so I can't possibly signoff!

Is there any way to make it so that I can force Pine to either leave off
x-sender (and sender), or to include the address I want in the x-sender
field?

It seems easy enough but I haven't been able to figure it out.

Thanks much,

Mike

Look in the distribution.

This is a job for the list owner. If the server really is LISTSERV, typically
the list owner's alias is listname-request. If the server is Majordomo or
ListProc, it's owner-listname. (Majordomo often uses listname-request as an
alias to send automated commands to the server.) Some servers improperly use
listname-owner.

Look at the Sender header the next time you get a message from the list. Often,
that's set to the list owner alias.

That's added when it's been handed off to the Mail Transport Agent. It hasn't
been added by pine.

>It seems easy enough but I haven't been able to figure it out.

You'd need privileges over the configuration of the MTA.

Sir, 
I do not find  any provision to go to Main menu after I complete "Compose"

method, pl advise.Ramachandran

Given a folder collection defined as

folder-collections=Spara mail/f/spara/[],
        imap-test {mail3.nada.kth.se/Debug}[],
 		:
		:

the second collection expands well i Pine 3.96 but gives a
folder list containing only "INBOX." in Pine 4.00. Choosing
that folder gives
  [Now in EMPTY directory: {mail3.nada.kth.se/Debug}INBOX.]

The server is Cyrus v1.5.10. 

Turning on enable-lame-list-mode makes it expand, but now with
two versions of each object: with and without a trailing ".".
For mailboxes it works to open the non-dot version but to go
down a directory you must open the trailing-dot-version.

What's up? Still disagreements about name handling in IMAP
servers?

	You're problem lies on the client.  Change the directory of
the incoming mail folders to:

	mail/

	For OE, its under the Advanced tab.  That works if you're
using Outlook Express, Outlook 98, and Netscape's mail client.  I hope
that solves your problem.  --Sean

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 4.01.  It is being released as a maintenance version of Pine 4.00
and contains little in terms of changes or enhancements from that version.

However, it does contain an imapd immune to the recently discovered
security holes as well as a few small changes based on early version 4.00
feedback.  More specific information regarding this release can be found
in the built-in release notes ("R" off the Main Menu), and via:

        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine
and:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

As with any Pine release, it is important that you carefully test and
determine for yourself that it performs suitably in your environment
before placing it into production use.

Source for the latest Pine release is available in: 

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.gz

and precompiled binaries for the various systems we have direct access to
are available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed

Unfortunately, we're still not prepared to release a corresponding version
of PC-Pine, but rest assured that we are working on it.

Sincerely,

The Pine Development Team

Versions 3.96 and before of Pine generated print requests without
automatically wrapping the lines.  This was very useful in sending 132
column reports to a user and then simply letting them print the reports to
a 132 column printer.

Versions 4.00 and 4.01 appear to wrap the lines automatically.  Is there
any option to disable this?

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I installed Pine-4.01 today hoping it would remove what
seems like an artificial constraint on the number of entries
one can have in an address book distribution list. No such
luck, the limit is still there. I looked in the documentation
for precisely what the limit is and how one might work around
it but I couldn't find anything.

Is the limit necessary?

If so, is the only work-around to break up long lists into
sub-lists and then use the sub-list names to make up the
list?

Thanks for any help. -Leif Neve

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 4.02.  This is intended as a maintenance release and provides only
a small set of important fixes to the previous versions.

OK, it looks like we tried to compress one too many changes into the
version 4.01 update.  With this release, the most heinous problems in the
Pine 4 releases have been addressed.  If you're using Pine 4, we strongly
recommend that you upgrade to this release.

Information on specific changes in this release can be found in the
built-in release notes ("R" off the Main Menu), and via:

        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine
and:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

As with any Pine release, it is important that you carefully test and
determine for yourself that it performs suitably in your environment
before placing it into production use.

Source for the latest Pine release is available in: 

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.gz

and precompiled binaries for the various systems we have direct access to
are available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed

Unfortunately, nothing's changed in the last 24 hours and we're still not
prepared to release a corresponding version of PC-Pine, but rest assured
that we are still working on it.

Sincerely,

The Pine Development Team

	check-fast-recent works again! thanks. Now I'm just waiting for
the expanded folders thingie. As a sidenote is there an easy way to remap
the keys maybe a enable-elm-user-keys? I have a whole bunch of elm users
to move to pine for imap and their main complaint is that pine is not elm
(sorry, couldn't help that one) but their real complaint is that the keys
aren't familiar. Thanks.

It would be a pain to do it right, wouldn't it?  Maybe not too hard
to hack it in, maybe if I'm bored sometime next century.  :)

Well, I can help a little.  Being a Pine evangelist myself, I've
written or helped to encourage elm --> pine conversions.

I've made the two patches I've written available on the web.  I'll
be updating them more in the next couple days or so.

	enable-vi-keys	
	    maps 	'j' to 'n'
			'k' to 'p'
			'/' to 'w'

	    It's not the cleanest patch because you lose Journal and Keyboard
	    lock, but it's good enough for me.

	ctrlw

	    Makes the "word erase" Ctrl-W work in the Composer; that is,
	    when you are editing your Headers.

	elmtopine

It would be very nice if new Pine versions were also available as a patch
to the previous version, as downloading over 2 MB through modem each time
is expensive. Thanks in advance for 4.01 -> 4.02 patch.

I had reported a similar error a day after pine4.00-release and this error
remains in pine4.02.

Desrciption:
 
-- I have 1 read message in INBOX and several messages in my
   read-message-folder=sav-inbox/saved-messages.

-- I have n+1 read messages in my folder filtered-incoming-mail/exim
   (n messages marked 'D') and several messages in 
   mail/sav-exim/saved-exim.
 
-- I'm in folder filtered-incoming-mail/exim and just type 'q'. Then Pine
   saves 1 message from filtered-incoming-mail/exim to
   mail/sav-exim/saved-exim, expunges n messages from
   filtered-incoming-mail/exim. 
   
   I think Pine should save now the message from INBOX to
   sav-inbox/saved-messages and expunge the message from INBOX. But Pine
   exits with

"Error saving to sav-inbox/saved-messages.  Not all messages moved."
 
And now the message from INBOX is duplicated:
  - Saved to sav-inbox/saved-messages
  - Remains in INBOX

================== 

The .pine-debug1 ends with the following lines:

[to pine-info mailing list and comp.mail.pine newsgroup]

I used to archive a number of folders using these two options in 3.96.
Without changing my .pinerc, this will not work in 4.02 out of the box, and
I have no desire to use the hierarchical thingy. Here's the deal:

* procmail sorts different mailing list mail into different folders:
  /home/peterg/incoming
* a simple script looks at the files in incoming, determines which ones
  have new mail in them, and creates links to /home/peterg/mail which is my
  mail folder (for pine's purposes). This way, I only see the folders that
  have new mail in them.

Here are the relevant parts of my .pinerc:

inbox-path=/var/spool/mail/peterg
...
incoming-folders=
...
incoming-archive-folders=freshmeat /home/peterg/oldmail/freshmeat,
        misc /home/peterg/oldmail/misc,
        mail-list.inet-access /home/peterg/mail/.old/inet-access,
(&c.)

And auto-move-read-msgs is set. How can I make it archive the folders? Is
this a bug or a known feature? Or, is there a more elegant solution with
pine4? Thanks for the help!

I'll try this one again...

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Greetings,

I'm using PC Pine and it's working quite well except for one annoying
problem:  I can't access my personal and global addressbooks on my Unix
smtp server.  If I login to my smtp server directly and run Unix Pine, no
problem.  All other operations in PC Pine work perfectly. 

The error I get is: "No addressbook operations are possible".

Is it me?

Joe

Greetings,

Given the recent spate of Pine releases I hesitate to bring this up, but
there are two rather serious bugs in Pine 4.02:

(1) Crashes during a 'select' command

    I wanted to move all of my pine-info email into a folder now that
    I've got a procmail for it set up.  After the following keystrokes:

      ; t t pine-info<cr>

      (that's Select Text To pine-info)

    Pine exits immediately.  This behavior is also apparent in
    Pine 4.01.

(2) Broken MH folder handling

    I have my postponed-message folder set to "#mh/drafts".  This
    has worked fine in the pass.  However, since the release of
    Pine 4.0, attempts to compose a message yield the following
    error:

       [Can't open Postponed mailbox: #mh/drafts]

    However, the postpone command works just fine (and the mail is
    saved into the folder as expected).

I'm using Pine on an SGI O2 running Irix 6.3 (recently patched).

Please let me know what I can do to help -- these bugs are more than a
minor inconvenience.

Thanks,

-- Lars

Viewing attached pictures with Pine 4.00

	Can anyone tell how can I use this feature?

I inserted this line in the global pine 4.00 configuration file:

image-viewer=/usr/bin/zgv

...but when I test this thing by trying to view and attached jpeg image
the text console just flickers (kinda changes into graphic mode) but it
becomes black a half a second and then is coming back to the text mode
screen like nothing happened. No actually, I tryied againg and I can see
that graphic mode image loading completion bar of zgv. But it won't
display any message only comes back to text mode.

When stopping this process with scroll lock I cand see

                           [VIEWER command launched]

                      [Decoding "Image, """ |          |]

                          [Displaying attachment     ]

and I can see a /usr/bin/zgv /tmp/img-JPE[some_number]

I THINK:        PERSONALLY I think that it is an encoding decoding problem
(mime, uue, base64 - stuff like this...). I think pine is trying to feed
zgv with raw 7 bit data :((((

	Anyone manage to view images with pine 4.00? Is this a bug or...?
... I have to make an script that decodes images? That would be pretty
much work to do... think and you'll agree...

	This would be a nice feature if it would work...

Hi,

This is what shows up in the debug file (level 9) when I load up Pine.

d_q_status_message(Opening "INBOX"     )
output_message({neviim.torah.org}INBOX : [UIDNOTSTICKY] Non-permanent
	unique identifiers: /home)
STATUS cmd:0, max:6, min3

I've already done  chmod 1777 on /var/spool/mail

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Subject: Pine tries to create INBOX on IMAP server?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello all, I've been having trouble using PINE with the IMAP4r1 server I'm
writing, and am unsure whether the fault lies with PINE or my understanding
of RFC2060 (probably the latter).

Anyways, here's the rundown.  I've only implemented about half of the
IMAP4rev1 features, but I figured it would be enough to test basic
operations with a clients (logging in, mailbox listing, etc).

So I compiled and installed PINE and tried to set it up for use with
my IMAP server.  However, I tried to (in PINE) save the collection I
had entered and PINE contacted the server and issued these commands
(taken from my log):

Jul 22 11:58:44 ulfheim in.rshd[11892]: connect from localhost
Jul 22 12:58:44 ulfheim imapd[11893]: normal read: [00000000 CAPABILITY]
Jul 22 12:58:44 ulfheim imapd[11893]: normal read: [00000001 LOGIN test test]
Jul 22 12:58:44 ulfheim imapd[11893]: normal read: [00000002 LIST "" ""]
Jul 22 12:58:44 ulfheim imapd[11893]: normal read: [00000003 LOGOUT]
Jul 22 11:58:46 ulfheim in.rshd[11900]: connect from localhost
Jul 22 12:58:46 ulfheim imapd[11901]: normal read: [00000000 CAPABILITY]
Jul 22 12:58:46 ulfheim imapd[11901]: normal read: [00000001 LOGIN test test]
Jul 22 12:58:46 ulfheim imapd[11901]: normal read: [00000002 Create INBOX]
Jul 22 12:58:46 ulfheim imapd[11901]: normal read: [00000003 LOGOUT]

The command that I'm having trouble with is that second to last one,
"Create INBOX".  According to RFC2060, 6.3.3:

      ...  It is an error to attempt to create INBOX or a mailbox
      with a name that refers to an extant mailbox.  Any error in
      creation will return a tagged NO response.

So my server generates "<tag> NO Tried to create INBOX" and PINE
seems to take that as a fatal error and refuses to save my collection
(The dialog "Tried to create INBOX" appears at the bottom of PINE's
window, and I am left at the "Create new collection" screen).

Here's what the client/server dialog actually looks like, simulated by
telnet:

S: * OK IMAP4rev1 Service Ready [Foomail 5.4.1]
C: 00000000 CAPABILITY
S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1
S: 00000000 OK Capability completed
C: 00000001 LOGIN test test
S: 00000001 OK User test logged in
C: 00000002 LIST "" ""
S: * LIST () "/" ""
S: 00000002 OK List completed
C: 00000003 LOGOUT
S: * BYE Performing logout
S: 00000003 OK Logout completed

<PINE reconnects>

S: * OK IMAP4rev1 Service Ready [Foomail 5.4.1]
C: 00000000 CAPABILITY
S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1
S: 00000000 OK Capability completed
C: 00000001 LOGIN test test
S: 00000001 OK User test logged in
C: 00000002 Create INBOX			<=== Here is the line
S: 00000002 NO Tried to create INBOX
C: 00000003 LOGOUT
S: * BYE Performing logout
S: 00000003 OK Logout completed


So, does anyone have any idea what is going on, and how I can remain
true to RFC2060 and have PINE work with my server at the same time?

By the way, this is PINE 4.00 with LDAP support newly compiled on
a Linux glibc-2 box.

Thanks for your time,

Is it possible to browse an LDAP server in Pine?  I've included the LDAP 
3.3 from UM and compiled, configured the ldap server in conf files and can 
search by partial name: i.e. "dav" returns all Dave and Davids in the list.

I'm told that Netscape and possibly other ldap clients can browse but can 
Pine?

Greetings!

I looked in the list archives, and it seems that noone has solved this
problem yet.  Since I did, I figured I'd join the list and send my
solution out to y'all.

To get rid of that annoying FOLDER INTERNAL DATA message that is screwing
up everything from BitchX to asmail to Microsoft Outlook 98, take a look
at the following (you'll have to recompile Pine, but it's worth it):

source file:  pine4.02/pine/init.c 

Original Version:
-----------------
/*
 * Turn on quelling of pseudo message.
 */
if(F_ON(F_QUELL_INTERNAL_MSG,ps_global))
mail_parameters(NULL, SET_USERHASNOLIFE, (void *) 1);

Fixed Version:
-----------------
/*
 * Turn on quelling of pseudo message.
 */
#if(F_ON(F_QUELL_INTERNAL_MSG,ps_global))
mail_parameters(NULL, SET_USERHASNOLIFE, (void *) 1);

Isn't it nice how one little comment symbol fixes a major annoyance?  :-)

I've been sending and receiving mail with Pine 4.02 and this fix for
several hours without any more of those messages.  I've even accessed my
spool with version 3.96 again, then back to 4.02, with no problems.  I've
tried sending and receiving mail with Eudora, Outlook, Outlook Express,
Pine, Fetchmail, and <shudder> Netscape Mail, and they all work fine, with
no more internal data messages.

If anyone can find a more "official" way to do it, great!  But until then,
this should suffice.

Hi Dave,

I recently found out that Bigfoot and Yahoo white pages among 7 others are
pre-configured in Outlook 98 as LDAP servers and you can add any LDAP
directory service too. Pretty cool, huh?

I guess its getting more support, and I would like to see an answer to your
question about using LDAP services with PINE, and also if there are any
converters to import adress books into PINE/from PINE ?

Subject: Browse LDAP server in Pine 4.02


Is it possible to browse an LDAP server in Pine?  I've included the LDAP
3.3 from UM and compiled, configured the ldap server in conf files and can
search by partial name: i.e. "dav" returns all Dave and Davids in the list.

I'm told that Netscape and possibly other ldap clients can browse but can
Pine?

Jordy,
One of us is definitely missing something...

Might not the "official" way to do it be just setting the 
   quell-folder-internal-msg
feature via the config screen??  Or are you saying that doesn't work for
you?

You *did* read the release notes for 4.01 or 4.02 before trying to modify
it, right?

I turned that option off by selecting 'quell-folder-internal-msg'
from the setup/config menu off the main menu...
this fixed the problem without hacking and rebuilding the source of 4.02.

well, at least it did for me.

Good job Gentleman!!

Strange, the (version last/next):pine-info@u.washington.edu never
mentioned this as either Added since 3.96v or what it did or didn't DO if
invoked..But, WE all "Saw" The Problem 8^)
No ONE had an answer, EVEYONE was concerned and I think _not_ Pleased!
  IMO, Someone mention recently on the list that 'we' can't convert or
keep up with the NEW versions fast enough... ANOTHER someone here
mentioned on the list that bugs were just found in a way earlier version..
no biggies, but THERE all the  same ! (sigh) :{
------------------
My thought (suggestion:) is to extend RFC-Pine(next) All "brilliant"
additions for a
minimual amount of time, beta test, (say at least 1-3 month minimually,
FSSTND is rolling in their ascii/grave that it is that short of a
suggested TIME.) Patches (sigh) should be released to VERSIONS, and NOT
ever to
be considered a NEW VERSION to cover ones tracks/oops. We don't bury
our dead with faulty coding and a higher v# like Big BIll!  The popularity
and STRENGTH of pine is (hopefully we'll never have to say WAS), *IS* Its
transportabilty between more platforms than any other, its ability to be
a solid and trusted Editor by SO's, Admin's and 'secretaries' and
(hey:) normal users around the world.. etc..etc.etc.

  Some functions while fun/silly should be voted on and and not included
by concensus of USERS of Pine. (period).. (example, graphics are fun (i
have a tv,) and html is quick,click,go (i have a computer:)) BUT unless it
works ------- I'll rest my case.


Again, congratulations! Jim & Jordy (red/HATS OFF TO YOU BOTH!)
Fixes should be from within, not from well.. H*ck, you know :)

Pine4.0x:

I reported this error 17 Jul 1998 10:41:47 +0200 (MET DST) and 22 Jul 1998
10:39:00 +0200 (MET DST).

Short description see below.

Now i explored the effect on 2 systems in parallel:
==================================================

** The imapd is on a Solaris-Box. pine, imapd etc. built with gs4.

** I get the error only using pine on the Solaris-box (all folders and 
   INBOX are local)

Description of test-actions (the local case):
============================================
 
-- I have 1 read message in INBOX and several messages in my
   read-message-folder=sav-inbox/saved-messages.
 
-- I have 1 read messages in my folder
   mail/sav-inbox/saved-messages-may-1998
 
-- I'm in folder mail/sav-inbox/saved-messages-may-1998, type 'd' for
   this message and then type 'q'.
   Then Pine expunges 1 msg from mail/sav-inbox/saved-messages-may-1998.
   
   I think Pine should save now the message from INBOX to
   sav-inbox/saved-messages and expunge the message from INBOX. But Pine
   exits with
 
"Error saving to sav-inbox/saved-messages.  Not all messages moved."
 
And now the message from INBOX is duplicated:
  - Saved to sav-inbox/saved-messages
  - Remains in INBOX

Does the fix of Pine4.02 plus 'quelling' the annoying Message
also stop IMAP from generating the same thing?
Or is this message ONLY generated by pine (but via imap) ?

I have users, who access Mail by pine 'here' and by something else
'from home' getting all those biffer/shell/mailtool mismatches
as mentioned in this thread before.

No, Pine doesn't have that capability. The closest it comes is if you go
into the Address book screen and enter the directory server from there.
Pine can do complicated LDAP searches (by using the ^T To complex search
command) but it isn't setup to do browsing.

We haven't been able to reproduce this problem or understand what is
happening. I am guessing that it is happening on Linux and Solaris systems
newer than the ones we have available. We have Linux 2.0.33 and Solaris
5.4. From Jauder's traces it looks like the problem is happening in the
opendir call in getfnames in pico/pico_os.c. If someone has a system
capable of reproducing the problem and you can step through it to see
what's happening, please let us know what the problem is! Thanks.

I'm not exactly sure what Jauder's problem is, but running pilot 
from 4.00 under Solaris 2.6 compiled with gcc 2.8.0 (from Solaris 2.5.1)
I can get pilot to consistency get a BUS error (A)dding a file 
when I'm in a big directory (big dir == >1500 entries):

Program received signal SIGBUS, Bus error.

Or, sometimes it will seg fault when just entering a big directory, as shown
below.  It's the same place in the code.

does anyone know how to quell this message, correct it or to tell imap to 
put the lockfile in the users home directory? (this message shows up on
Pc-Pine 3.96 connecting to the imap server included with pine4.02)

Subject: Non consistent behavior of Incoming vs. Defined Collections
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I'm using defined folder collections to hold verious meta related incoming
mail folders; 'NetBSD' and 'FreeBSD' for example, used for containing all
folders for each mailing list I'm subscribed to.

These defined collections do not act like the Incoming collection; they
treat the MC_TAB event differently.  Is there a reason for this?  I'd
really like to have consistent behavior across all collections or at least
the ability to turn next folder/message/collection off or on depending.

I've not tracked down the relevent part of the code as I've got other
things to deal with this week.  Does anyone with more knowledge of the
code have any ideas?

Thanks.

Hi,

The routine pine uses to get the domain name fails when the
name of the computer is not fully qualified, and that causes
pine to add a 'Sender' header.

This is problematic because the Sender will contains an invalid
address and the tools that uses the Sender instead of the From
won't be able to communicate.

This issue has already been discussed in the mailing list, and ended
in proposition to end the /etc/host or /etc/sendmail.cf. Since this
would be a non-trivial change, for which I found no good reference,
I didn't manage to persuade our sys. admin to proceed.

I've found on D=E9j=E0 News a solution for this problem and adapted it
to pine. The solution is easily applied, has been tested with both
pine 3.9? and 4.0? and gives us satisfaction.=20

To use it,
1) save the attachment as 'domnames.fq' (fq =3D fully qualified)
   in the pine/osdep directory, where it will compliment the
   domnames and domnames.dos
2) edit in os-xxx.ic the line
include(domnames)
   to read
include(domnames.fq)
3) type 'make os-xxx.c' to have the change take effect,
   and build pine again.

I think it would be a good idea to include this alternate domnames.fq
with future distribution of pine, wouldn't it?

Greetings,

I did read the release notes, and adding the quell-folder-internal-msg did
not fix the problem for me.  That's why I recompiled.  Otherwise, why
would I bother? :-)

That's what the rest of us were wondering!

p.s. If you can reproduce the failure of the "official" feature, please
provide more details on your environment, as it seems to work for
"everyone else"... :)

I noticed an annoying change in 4.00 , in the older version, when a
message was displayed, the email addresses would list all the way to the
last column like this

	From	: xxx@yyy.com
	To	: asdfg@hjk.com, qwerty@uio.edu, zxcvbn@bmm.com 
	Cc	: qetqwetr@hjk.com, asdgasdfa@uio.edu, zxcvbn@bmm.com 

Now, it displays with a carriage return after each item :

	From	: xxx@yyy.com
	To	: asdfg@hjk.com,
		  qwerty@uio.edu,
		  zxcvbn@bmm.com 
	Cc	: qetqwetr@hjk.com,
		  asdgasdfa@uio.edu,
		  zxcvbn@bmm.com 

Is there an option to set it back ?  I get a lot of messages with huge
recipient lists, and I hate paging down 2 or 3 times before I get to the
message body.


Thanks,

    Shawn Jeffries

Relax, he didn't exactly ask about procmail, awk, sed, or egrep. He asked
if it were possible in *PINE*. All you did was try to act =FCbercool, total=
ly
ignoring his question. It would be understandable if, in your first post,
you offered the above as a solution; however you just shot your mouth off
instead. Now, do you have a pine-related answer or not? If not, why don't
you refrain from "answering"?

Ken, really, take a pill.

It's an annoying change, and it is due to PINE.

I've got a message which is _fine_ but when PINE gets ahold of it, it screws  
it up.  procmail et al are USELESS as was your response in this situation.

Would you like a copy of the message with hundreds of addresses that now  
scrolls dozens of times more than it needs to?

I'm all for getting people to read the FAQ or checking DejaNews, but when  
someone asks a legit question that hasn't been answered before describing an  
annoying new behavior, must you spout off?  And if so, could you at least  
attempt to grasp the problem enough to give a suggestion that would have a  
chance in hell of helping, rather than blathering off about man pages to  
programs which won't help the situation?

Another example showed up today, that reminded me that it would be nice
to have kill files in pine, or I will need to hand edit my .procmailrc
again :-)

Hello, I'm volunteer tester of PINE software into two systems: AIX4.1/3.2
and NeXTstep 3.0 and I still see some extrange messages refering to
Mailbox vulnerability just on AIX4.1 like this:

Mailbox vulnerable - error creating /var/spool/mail/august.lock.901321877.1898

I'm still trying to figure it out, 'cause on AIX3.2 and NeXTstep 3.0 PINE
software run fine, so I hope suggestions of what to do... thanx and keep
feeding this incredible mailbox listing...


Regards from Colima, MEXICO.


Augusto A. Guerrero Rodriguez.

After upgrading from Pine 3.96 -> 4.02 and successfully getting all of the
locking issues worked out :) ... I have stumbled across a new issue. 

When viewing a standard MIME message of > 200k, pine aborts and core dumps
with the following exit message sent to STDOUT:

Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
Pine Exiting.
Abort (core dumped)

I'm unable to reproduce the same problem exporting the same message to 
Pico 3.2 via Pine 3.96.

Any ideas?

I use pine 4.02 on AIX 4.2.1 and I haven't seen these messages. However, I
*have* seen them on (at least) pine 4.00 on a RedHat 5.1 machine. Could it
be a permissions thing or a different locking mechanism or what?

Hello all,

I am using Pine with speech and am wondering if message lists can be
altered.  When you press i for index, it lists messages like this
number date from size subject
I'd like to make it so the size isn't listed...less to read since I get
over 500 emails per day it makes it easier.  Can this be done?

Not without hacking the source code, and I don't know how easy it would be.

Shane:

Look at the help under "index-format" in main||setup||config.  It
describes how to reformat the index display.  No source code changes
required.

Please excuse me for intruding, but did you say Pine *with speech*???
<startled look>
Until now, I was unaware that such a thing was possible...<incredulous shake
of head>
Does it sort of work like this.....
------<hallucination>
"Pine, take a letter"
"Dear List[comma][nedwline][first letter capitalized]"
"I am astonished to learn that typing is no longer necessary [comma] owing
to the genius of the [capital letters]PINE [lowercase]team at Ewe
Wash[period]"
------</hallucination>
Seriously, do I understand this correctly...speech?????

If the luser would actually rtfm, he would know that he could grep the
other addresses out, before they even get to pine!!!

Whatever.=20
I really don't give a fuck if he has to page thru the extra header info.
Mine works.

Pine is trying to write its .lock files to /var/spool/mail/, yet its
running as the uid executing it (august), whom probably does not have
write permissions to /var/spool/mail/.

The solution, make pine setgid to the mail group or chmod /var/spool/mail/
to 1777, world writable with a sticky bit so files can only be deleted by
respective owners or UID 0.

This is all in the release notes/technical documentation of pine 4.x.

BULLSHIT!!!!
You have _NO_ clue what you are talking about.
Set up a procmail recipe, grep the To: info, awk anything other than the
first address out.
Simple.

OR, as I said in my _ORIGINAL_ post, just press ctrl-v.

No.
As I said in my pervious response, I don't care.
Mine works.

To the List members, and Shane;
Please accept my aplogies for a completely braindead and utterly
insensitive, ignorant post re: Pine with speech.
I misread and completely misunderstood the significance of "Pine with
Speech" and i aplogize to Shane and my fellow list members for stupidity,
fatigue induced ignorance, and foolishness in general.

Ken,
The definition of brilliance is not what you know, but the graciousness with
which you overlook the shortcomings of others.
You are clearly having a stressful day, night...and maybe have taken some
medication which is causing your antisocial behaviour. That's OK Ken, we
understand that you may be unable to control your keyboard Tourette
Syndrome.
I vivdly recall once being in the grip of that accursed disorder. It caused
me to periodically experience uncontrollable trembling, and a tendency to
utter (and type) inappropriate things like; "Underpants on Fire" for no
particular reason.
We feel your pain Ken, acutely. In fact your pain is causing us all pain!
May I recommend therapy, perhaps hand hacking Xconfig files for two weeks
straight until your affliction has subsided?
----<Humor Over, Now for the brawl>
BTW, although *I* might well be described as a "clueless f*&ck" because I am
NOT a programming genius as you clearly are, (in fact you must be the Albert
Einstein of programming based upon your insufferable arrogance, and
disgustingly inappropriate language) BUT, the gentleman (and he is a
gentleman BTW) who replied to you is not clueless as you suggest. Instead,
he engaged you in a discussion, and from a position of knowledge I might
add.
Ken, get a life, a wife, a prescription...something. No-one on this list has
any time for your behaviour. You will be procmailed out of most people's
Inboxes I rather suspect (including my own) Your behaviour is pathetic and
unforgivable.
You owe the list members an apology, and should really address your manner
of communicating via email. It is in a word UNACCEPTABLE!
Good Night Sir, I hope your hard drive crashes, your connection dies, and
your Motherboard takes the Mother of all dumps. You deserve no less.
-Colin.

Bruno:

If you make pine sgid mail you have likely given everyone the ability to
read each others' mail, or at least the ability to delete it. To stop them
from being able to delete each other's mail, you'd need to add the sticky
bit to the spool directory. In which case you are back to fixing the
problem the other way.  The real fix is 01777 for your mail spool
directory.

Ok, you win.
I'm wrong, you're right.
(this is entirely too much trouble, and like I said, mine works.)

Perhaps if some of you lusers would actually take the time to RTFM, you
wouldn't have these stupid little problems.

Apparently you believe that to be true for everyone on the planet besides yourself.

Oh yeah, that's useful, as long as you don't mind losing all the information  
about who the message was sent to.

Your suggestion wasn't useless, it was stupid.

I saw your original post.  It still doesn't address the issue of why PINE  
changed this behavior, why it wasn't made optional.

It's not a great workaround.

If there was some keystroke to "skip down to the end of the headers" then  
that would be helpful.

It works for you, it doesn't work for others.

No.  I'm not going to be pushed around by someone with nothing better to do  
than spout off superiority-complex when someone asks a question you decide  
isn't useful.


Can someone offer any suggestions that will not lose all the information  
stored in the headers besides "just ignore it and ctrl-v" ?

Who said anything about loosing them??? Redirect them into a temp file.
Assuming you want to reply, redirect them back into the headers.  
Duh.
Not all that difficult.

Whatever.

The answer is no.
Go back to 3.9x if you don't like the way that 4.0x works.

This is my final response to this thread. 

(any response to this is going to /dev/null, so, really, don't take the
time to respond.  I'm never going to get it)

I said nothing about "loosing" them.  However, I was, concerned about  
"losing" them.

Redirecting them to a temp file?  What if I don't read the message as soon  
as it comes in?  What do I keep these temp files around?  For how long would  
you suggest?

Rather a moronic option that makes like more difficult.

yeah whatever Ken


> RTFM, asshole.

Which thus sums up Ken's entire vocabulary.

I know the system I am using fine.  I have a several thousand line set of  
procmail recipes.  I just don't want to hack the message to make up for what  
PINE decided to do.

Me.

> Don't be so goddamn lazy!!!!

The computer and the programs I use are supposed to make my life easier.   
PINE's latest change has made it more difficult.  This is going at it the  
wrong way.




> > It's not a great workaround.

But you just can't see that others can not like your idea and still not be  
mentally incompetent.

Yeah, I want the computer to do things which will make me have to do less.   
I want my mail-reading program to have the features which will make reading  
email as easy and take as short amount of time & frustration as possible so I  
can get on with my life off the computer.

The only helpful thing you've said so far.

I'll respond with the hopes that someone who isn't a foul-mouthed control  
freak with a self-esteem problem might have a solution.... Or perhaps the  
PINE folks would be willing to make this "feature" optional.

Now that the shouting seems to be quieting down . . .

You can prune those To: lists with a display filter.
It won't be exactly easy since the filter will have
to include a decent RFC822 parser.  Anyway take a
look at Setup|Config|display-filters.  It's down
near the end of the Setup|Config screens.

Thanks very much for pointing that out.  Another feature I was unaware of.

One thing that is a little odd, at least seemingly so.

When I read the online help for that, it says:

	The default is equivalent to:

index-format=STATUS@MSGNO@DATE@FROMORTO(33%)@SIZE@SUBJECT(67%)

	Except the @ symbols are actually the little "c in a circle" aka the  
Copyright symbol.
	
	When I copied&pasted that in PINE, it turned them into @ symbols
	
	When I copied&pasted that into this email message (not PINE) it  
turned them into ( marks.
	
	What are they supposed to be?  It seems to work with just spaces in  
there but I wasn't sure if there was something else that was supposed to be  
there, since there's apparently some symbol in the default.
	
	Thanks

There's no FM to R in this case.

Your ideas about seg/awk/grep was not really a solution.

This behavior is new to PINE and the solution should be in PINE, not in  
having to do Unix gymnastics to get it to work.

I'd really just be happy if there were a way to make PINE go back to the old  
behavior of putting as many addresses on one line as will fit.

I agree that the new behavior looks nicer in many circumstances, but where  
there are a lot of addresses, fitting them more compactly would be  
preferable.

I am trying to connect to an IMAP server at my ISP.

Having never done this before, I looked around for a "How To" and didn't find much.

Using 4.02, I went to the Incoming Message Folders screen, Added the Server  
name and the Path on the Server.

The result was a

	BUSY </>

that has spun for minutes and minutes and cannot be Cancelled (even though  
^C appears on the bottom menu for Cancel)


I would simply like to be able to read messages on the server, and (if  
possible) have access to my entire ~/mail directory on that server.

Is what I tried correct?  If not, can someone point me to a FM to R?

	I wouldn't have known unless a friend and fellow list member had
gently advised me, off-list. It was kind of that person to do so, and they
have been thanked off-list "Pine with Speech" is actually a speech module
(of some unknown design)  that apparently enables the visually impaired to
perform a variety of tasks in this visual medium. 
	Now that I think of it, I saw something like that months ago on CNN (I
think). It's probably a lifesaver for those who cannot paricipate via the
conventional interface. 
	I went off on a tear inspired, in part, by the various
voice recognition packages that are cropping up (and failing to work) all
over the place. The curse of Satan, IBM's "Via-Voice" comes to mind. (I
stupidly loaded an early version and promptly destroyed my OS)  *Then* I
thought about the incongruity of such a package in the context of a bare
bones text client such as Pine...and well, fatigue and literary license
(coupled with a juvenile sense of humor) took over.
	Well, I've always felt that if you make a fool of yourself, you
oughtta promptly set things to rights. That way, the world knows you're a
fool, but not malicious or ignorant. I felt that I was dangerously close
to the ignorant, and lest malicious got inadvertenly got tossed in there,
believed the best thing was to aplogize without delay, and admit to
foolishness. "Know Thyself" springs to mind I guess.

Hi,

I have a local news server so I set the nntp server in pine to news.cm.nu
which is basically localhost.  Now I don't spool all newsgroups there so I
want to define another news server for a different set of newsgroups.
E.G. news.cm.nu carries comp.lang.perl.* but not comp.lang.c.*  I would
like to be able to use another news server (news.bctel.ca) for
comp.lang.c.*.  Can I do it?

Ken,
	I'm glad "yours works" first of all.
	Secondly, I wan't defending a practice or technique. Frankly I
know only the most fundamental aspects of procmail, and next to nothing
about some of the exotica concerning mail transport, and the finer points
of message headers. 
	The purpose of the list (oh duh) is to discover how to accomplish 
certain tasks, the techniques of which elude the comprehension of certain
members. That's why I'm a a member....to learn.
	Oh, I agree wholeheartedly with you when you state that more RTFM
would answer *some*  questions, and would cut down on list traffic
measureably.....perhaps. This list is quieter now than previously, believe
me 
	That however is not the core issue. The level of expertise on this
list is (in general) quite high. Also, sometimes members *do* ask
questions that *probably* could be found via RTFM. Since the indivuiduals
concerned are not clueless newbies, they may need an answer fairly rapidly
because they have a serious problem on-site. I believe it's called leeway,
and tolerance Ken. In short, they get answers. Sometimes that might be
accompanied by a "and you can find more on this at 
http://someURLatUWash.edu" 
	Come on Ken, is your time *so* precious, and are you *so* self
involved that you belittle someone (seriously in my view) for not knowing
that xx piece of information *might* reside on *some* directory
*somewehere* in the public domain?? I might remind you that the first line
of your resume at http://www.kens.com is;
	"To apply current technical expertise while continuing growth of
knowledge and skills."
	I took the time to look at your site because I couldn't believe
the level of arrogance you brought to that exchange with Tim. Your
skillset is indeed impressive, and without doubt you are miles ahead of me
(for starters) in general and specific technical knowledge. Tell me this
though, *How did you learn all that?* Did someone try to cut you into
filets verbally if you asked a question, when the answer could be found in
a book?? How can you continue to grow your knowledge and skills, when the
humility necessary for true acquisition of knowledge is clearly absent.
	Then again, as Dennis Miller has been known to say; "That's just
my opinion....I could be wrong". 
Regards,
-Colin.

May I take the liberty of ignoring the majority of "highly informative"
responses in this thread and instead suggest another possible (better?)
solution...

If you are receiving messages with very long recipient lists then, rather
than have each and every recipient either silently suffering or trying to
figure out a workaround, the better solution might be to get the problem
fixed "at source"?

You might like to contact the people responsible for sending out the
messages and ask they start lisiting the recipients using the "Bcc:" header
rather than the "To:" or "Cc:" headers.

As you probably know "To:" is for listing the prime recipients of the
message, with carbon-copies (eg, for "information only" purposes) being
listsed in the "Cc:" header.

The often overlooked "Bcc:" (Blind Carbon Copy) can be used to list
recipients *but* with the addition that the entire recipient list is removed
from the delivered copyof the message.  This means that you wouldn't get to
see the list of 50+ recipients in your message at all!  (It also has the
added advantage of preventing the dreaded "reply-to-all" problem, where
people reply to the every recipient rather than just the original poster.)

Note that if you do use "Bcc:" you should ensure that there is at least one
valid address given in the "To:" header too; otherwise some brain-dead mail
delivery agents throw a wobbly and insert each and every supposedly
concealed "Bcc:" recipient in a series of "Apparently-to:" headers (which
rather defeats the object! :-)

A useful trick to know, if you don't want to put a real e-mail address in
the "To:" field, is to put in a string (usually a descriptive name of the
list or just something like "Various recipients") with the magic sequence
	:;
at its end.  For example:
	Bcc:  Various recipients:;

Most mail delivery software will recognise this as being a valid address but
which doesn't need anything delivering to it.  (I think it's called
something like "group syntax" ... I forget.)

Cheers,

Mike B-)

[Very good suggestions removed for brevity]

The "source" the problem for me are often people in other companies.  Some
of
these are a level where I'd rather not risk offending them or troubling them
with
technical questions or details they are bound to ask...yet not understand.

Basically, I see the source of the problem to be the new display routine.
It hadn't
bothered me during the beta test period, but then again I didn't get such an
email
during the beta test.

By and large, I can see no drawback in having multiple names on the same
line but I can
agree that there are drawbacks in the new format.  So, if there are no bugs
or unstated
drawback with returning to the old format I'd simply like to see that
happen.

Regards,
Ed

It was painful but amusing to watch the greatest explosion of stupidity
and arrogance that I've ever seen on a mailing list.  The original
question was perfectly reasonable and Ken Wood's responses did not answer
the original question.  Why would Ken even send his message?  If Ken wants
people to know who he is, he's succeeded.  I saw his web page at
www.kens.com.  It looks like he wants to get a job.  If asked, what could
I say now about Ken?  He knows a lot, but not enough, and he's too
arrogant and mean to help people with their computing problems:  Don't
hire Ken.  Congratulations Ken, you've made a complete fool of yourself in
front of everyone.

If anyone has procmail set up, this is the perfect way to silently banish
Ken, his rantings, profanity, and generally offensive behavior...

	  :0:
        *^From:.*@kens.com
        /dev/null
Then, I did some reading (Ken, it's called RTFM OK?) and came up with the
following, which is probably *the* correct way to deal with the Kens of
this world...tank their mail, and autorespond 'em, informing them of said
fact!

    # This recipe will generate an autoreply header and bounce this
    # nastygram back
    # to the sender.
    # Note the lack of a c flag which means that we never see this mail.

Oh well, back to the farm. The stables need cleaning, and the tractor is
making starnge noises. It may require some maintenance :-)

Ken, I'd post from the bofh.net address if I cared enough about this
reply.

What you ahve suggested is a denial of service attack which probably
violates the terms of service agreement you signed with your provider.

While your actions are fairly childish and silly, I'm sure the sysadmin of
your site would be able to show you a sufficiently BOFHly response to your
childishness.

Grow up.

You should put spaces between the element names.  This is in the help
also.

Go to Mainmenu||Setup||Config and specify the value of inbox-path
as {mailbox-host}INBOX.  The braces are
important and must remain.  Replace mailbox-host with the fully-qualified
domain name (FQDN) or your ISP's mail host.  So, you're definition looks
like:

	{mail.peak.org}inbox


This info is available in the context help for inbox-path on the config
screen and in the Valid Folder Names hyperlink off that help page.

I'm seeing the problem with pine 4.02 on AIX4.2.1.  I've looked at all the
permissions I could think of.  I don't have the problem with pine 3.96 on
the same box.  If anyone has solved this problem please let us know.

   From the looks of things, he probably *is* the sysadmin of his site,
and in fact for several other sites on the Verio network. It looks like
they buy their bandwidth from digex, which has an acceptable use policy
strictly forbidding such things- so just forward his message to
abuse@digex.net, and/or support@digex.net (I am about to do so) and we'll
see what *they* have to say about that.

   Even more effective though, would be a letter to the higher-ups at
verio.net that tell them exactly what kind of employee they have. (unless
he made up all that stuff on his resume of course) How's this... If enough
people write, it *will* be noticed.

-----
Greetings,

   I've been assessing several companies to provide my site with internet
services, and was strongly considering yours- that is until I came across
postings from one of your employees named Ken Woods.

<quote some of his witty banter here>

   His childishness and obscenity have caused me to remove your company
from the list of those I was considering. I hope that he is not typical
of people you employ, but I can not take the risk that you would tolerate
this illegal, unethical activity at your site perpetrated by one of your
workers. I just wanted to make this known to you.

Sincerely,
<x>
-----

   I'm pretty tired of this discussion. If we ignore him, eventually he'll
go away. If we have to waste too much more time talking about things no
related to pine I suggest we do some mass-mailing of our own and see how
things shape up then.

Hi,

I know how much fun it can be...but the purpose of the list is to
discuss issues related to "pine".

Can we now dispense with discussing Ken?  

And please, refrain from responding to this "call to order" in this
forum.

Thanks,
Ed

*sigh*

Why do you think Verio is only a Digex customer?  From where I'm sitting
it looks like they buy lines from a number of tier 2 providers.

Regardless, taking action before he actually commits any attack is
pointless as its fairly difficult to prove intent.

Ken probably knows better than to actually do these sorts of things.

I reacted strongly because someone threatening to launch a DOS attack
should be taken seriously.

Again, Ken is doing this on his dime and with his hardware and net
connectivity.  If he's good at what he does is Verio going to care that
they have an asshole working for them?  Probably not.  At no point did Ken
represent Verio in this discussion.

Just let it drop; filter Ken if you can't resist being insulted when he
mouths off.

All this fuss is playing down to him, which was his intent in the first
place.

Thanks for this excellent bit of information (in your appended message).
One question: When you wrote the following...

...did you really mean to put this in the Bcc: field?  Or should it go in
the To: field?

Thanks much!

Mike

Bruno, Thanks for the response.  I set /var/spool/mail to 1777 which took
care of the error message.  I notice that it also opens up /var/spool/mail
for temporary storage for anyone who wants to use it and it makes
it possible for someone to distroy their own inbox.  I don't see these
as serious problems, but I wonder what serious problems were in pine3.96
that make this a better way?

This problem was still there in Pine 3.96, pine just didn't display the
error message until 4.x :)  So, the main reason to implement the mode
change on /var/mail/ would be to get rid of this error message.  The
locking shouldn't be too catastrophic given if a user is reading their
e-mail in pine, they would presumably not be using pop at the same time or
using simultaneous (and multiple) occurences of pine.

As far as the 1777 setting on your mail spool directory..  Users should
have been able to delete their own inbox before since their mailbox is
owned and writable by them.  Yes, this does open up /var/mail/ for temp
storage, but this isn't the end of the world.  We're running nightly crons
that not only make sure proper permissions are set on all of the spool
files, but it also deletes any spool files that do not have a
corresponding user entry in the passwwd [file|table].

Good luck.  :)

Love the idea, but one problem...Pine seperates the : and ; by a space after
you type in "Various recipients:;" so it ends up looking like this:

To: Various recipients: ;

Unfortunately, sendmail bounces a copy of the message back to me as
undeliverable, even though it does deliver the message to the Bcc: list.
I've tried everything short of gluing the : and ; together, to no avail.

Any suggestions?

I may be missing something, but it looks like a few people have overlooked
something which I had to have pointed out to me.

The Lcc: header entry allows one to  suppress the individual names on a
distribution list yet automattically have the full name of the list appear
in the "to: column on incoming mail to the list memebers.

One creates a distribution list using the A screen.  If you have the
default header options for your outgoing mail, compose a message to your
list and enter ^R (rich headers) when the cursor is in the header region.
But your nickname for the distribution list in the Lcc: line and nothing
else.  When you enter carriage return, it will display your list members,
but they will not appear when the mail is delivered to the addressees.  If
you want to have the Lcc: appear automatically in your header set, you can
change your preferences to make it happen.

I just checked this feature, as I'm still running pine 3.96 on my site.

OK, pine 3.96 doesn't lock the inbox, but this isn't a problem, really,
because pine 3.96 DOES check inbox access, using some sort of virtual
locking. As soon as a new process tries to open inbox, pine writes
back the latest changes, hands its virtual locking over to the newly
started process, and sets the old session read-only.

The following message appears on the old session:
[Another Pine is accessing Inbox.  Session now Read-Only.]

In fact, for people logging in from another terminal this is quite a
useful feature, as it eliminates the need to kill the old process
first. Why not allowing something similar in pine 4.x?

Regards,

Andre : andre.haenni@zkb.ch

Yup, it shouls indeed go in the "To:" field: the whole point is to have a
valid address there to appease the brain-dead mail delivery agents and their
"Apparntly-to:" headers.

Sigh.

OK... So let me throw in one other gem that people often don't find out
about.  Whilst the "To:/Cc:/Bcc:" header information should apply to
virtually any mail client this one is, as far as I am aware, specific to
Pine.

Along with "Bcc:" Pine also has an "Lcc:" header field.  This is
purpose-designed for use with Distribution Lists you set up in your Address
Book.  To send a message "safely" to a Distribution List you can simply use
the "Lcc:" field (see below) instead of faffing on with "Bcc:" and setting
up a valid-but-empty address in "To:" using the magic "Some string:;"
notation.

Instead you just type the Distribution List's nickname into the "Lcc:"
field.  When the message is sent the members of the Distribution List will
be listed as recipients of the message in a "Bcc:" header.  However the
sneaky thing is that Pine will automatically use the full (descriptive) name
of the Distribution List to construct the magic ":;" line for the "To:"
header.

So if you set up a Distribution List in your Pine Address Book along these
lines:

	Nickname:	netcontacts
	Full name:	Network Maintenance People
	Members:	abc@xyz.com, def@xyz.com, ...

you can then just type "netcontacts" into the "Lcc:" field and have Pine do
all the rest.

If you are REALLY cunning, of course, you'll have set up an "Fcc:" folder
for the Distribution List in your Address Book.  Then any message you send
out to "netcontacts" will be set to have a copy of your message filed into
the nomianted folder instead of the generic default (usually "sent-mail"). 
[This also applies to Individual entries, not just Distribution Lists]

NOTE:  Because the full name is used in the "To:" field when a message is
sent out the recipient(s) get to see it.  This means you should not put
anything too rude in there (unless you don't mind them seeing it!) ... save
such remarks for the entry's "Comments" field! ;-)  [Again, this applies to
both Distribution List and Individual entries in your Address Book.]

Cheers,

Mike B-)

This shouldn't matter at all.  Certainly our sendmail (version 8.8.7)
happily accepts this.

This sounds unusual: the only time we've ever seen a problem is back in the
days when all our mail was relayed through a server running PP before
reaching sendmail on our delivery host.  PP didn't understand the ":;" magic
and faked up some strange address whilst adding a parse-error warning
header.

You may like to check which version of the sendmail software your site is
running (telnetting to the SMTP port on your server will probably tell you
this.

A silly question you can check at the same time (forgive me if you're the
system administrator as you probably already know the answer!) but are you
sure sendmail is being used?  Some sites use other software (qmail, smail,
etc) and I don't know how these handle ":;" ... mind, having said that I've
never heard of anyone else have ":;" flagged as being undeliverable.

By the way, Ken didn't implement his crontab to send me one null message

*sob* Thank you, Mike, for sharing your experience with the group. You know,
we all have our ups and downs, and it's good to know that you and Mike have
talked about your aggression and your anger.

No, pine 4.02 still passes the lock on to the new process, much the same
as pine 3.96 except that the messages indicating another process is
accessing inbox are no longer automatically displayed in the old session.

Yet this would be the very nature of locking: the new process would say it
cannot open inbox, because it's still locked by another process...

I can imagine situations where such a lock would be used, but I agree
with you -- most of the time, passing the lock on to the new process
is exactly what we want.

I guess the locking mode should be a configuration switch in pine 4.x,
but, at any rate, permissions on /var/spool/mail should not HAVE to be
set to 1777, as pine 4.02 anyway does NOT keep a lockfile there: pine
seems to try writing it, then removes it immediately. What's that good for?

This may sound odd, but in .pinerc (or, better, in pine.conf) are you
using the "smtp-server=" setting or the "sendmail-path=" setting?  When
we used the latter, we got the same behavior described above, but when
we switched to the former (for entirely separate reasons), the LCC:
feature clicked in place and has worked just fine ever since.

Mike, Timothy, Colin and other have had some very good suggestions as
to how users of pine (and other mailers) can prevent *sending* of large
To: lists.

The problem is that you very seldom have control over what *others* send
you.  Yes, there are times you can send suggestions.  But, equally, there
are times when you can't or dare not.  The result of not being able to
control what is being sent to you can be annoying.  In this particular case,
a long list of recipients with each on a single line.

If you can't control what is being sent to you...what are the alternatives?

Some have suggested a process which chops off some of the To:'s and puts
them
in a safe place for later reference.  This seems fine for those inclined to
do the work of putting things back together.  However, it seems to defeat
the
purpose of having a computer to make things easier.  Also, it is seems to be
solution which may be to complex for the average user.  (Not all users of
pine
have a Masters in computer science.  :-) )

So, what choice is left?  Well, maybe there are 2 solutions.

1.  Revert to the old viewer of pine where more than one recipients is shown
on a line.

2.  Modify pine to display a "maximum recipient" list with an indication
that the remainder
    of the list is suppressed and that key "x" should be hit to reveal the
full list.

Just some ideas.....

Regards,
Ed

I posted this originally hoping there was a simple fix, but the tread has
gone off on a tangent, and argumentative. Here are some things I failed to
mention :

 1> I routinely get messages of up to 50 recipients. 
 2> I get usually 60-100 messages like this per day.
 3> It is not very practical for the senders to use Bcc: or Lcc: when
    they send messages out because frequently they require replies which
    need to be forwarded to everyone on the list.
 4> Whatever anyone says, we all use Pine because it is efficient and
    quick to navigate. I don't WANT to ^V every single message to get to
    the body (or even the subject line).
 5> I want to upgrade everyone to 4.00 at my company, but I know this
    will be a pain in the ass for everyone (I am testing it now).
 6> Above all, I just want the old display scheme to work.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
I noticed an annoying change in 4.00 , in the older version, when a
message was displayed, the email addresses would list all the way to the
last column like this

	From	: xxx@yyy.com
	To	: asdfg@hjk.com, qwerty@uio.edu, zxcvbn@bmm.com 
	Cc	: qetqwetr@hjk.com, asdgasdfa@uio.edu, zxcvbn@bmm.com 

Now, it displays with a carriage return after each item :

	From	: xxx@yyy.com
	To	: asdfg@hjk.com,
		  qwerty@uio.edu,
		  zxcvbn@bmm.com 
	Cc	: qetqwetr@hjk.com,
		  asdgasdfa@uio.edu,
		  zxcvbn@bmm.com 

Is there an option to set it back ?  I get a lot of messages with huge
recipient lists, and I hate paging down 2 or 3 times before I get to the
message body.


Thanks,

I hope this one doesn't start a fight.

In previous version of Pine, when doing a sort by subject, any leading "["
characters were ignored. Now those are sorted to the top. Anyone know a
way to return to the old way? Many posts have the same keyword at the
start of the subject line (some surrounded by brackets like [text] and
some not) . Now Pine sorts them separately.

In the interest of brevity:

Mike - We run sendmail 8.6.13 (egads!) so you may be right.  Since this
is not a mission critical function, I'll just wait until I get a later
version of sendmail in the next DG/UX Rev.  Yes, I am the sysadmin.

Cliff - Thanks for the suggestion, but Unix Pine users don't need to define 
smtp-server in their .pinerc/pine.conf files.  That would be PC-Pine.

Thanks again,
Joe

I'd like to propose using ^R as the key for this purpose. The mnemonic
is already in place (display rich headers). The maximum number of
recipients to display (in colapsed view) should also be user
configurable. Example (max-recipient = 1):

procmail. If you don't start using procmail within the next 24hrs, your head
will be chopped off. Trust me. You want to kill this garbish (mainly endorsed

	Hi--

	On FreeBSD 2.2.6, I've compiled a fresh 4.02 set of binaries, and
pico still prepends "U" all over the first line of a file I've edited.

	Is this a fix-in-progress?

	Wait a minute. The pico I built on FreeBSD from the 4.02 source
gives "3.1" as the version number. Yet a 4.02 I built on BSDI has "3.2".

	Hmm...

I am running the SunOS version of Pine on SunOS 4.1.4 and
the problem I see right now is a refresh problem.

If I am looking at an email which extends beyond 1 page,
and I have pressed the spacebar to reach the end of the
email, and I pop a window in top of the Pine window,
when I pop the Pine window to the top, the window refreshes
but refreshes back to the top of the email.

This did not occur with Pine 3.96.

Joe, I should have been more concise, sorry.  I was referring to the
behavior of unix Pine, and I meant that if your sysadmin hadn't defined
smtp-server you might want to override it in your .pinerc, or if you
*are* the sysadmin, you might want to set it in pine.conf.

Please read the Pine technical notes sections on locking... as well as
the release notes on this specific topic.

You are spreading quite a bit of misinformation here.

(Hint: Pine uses more than one kind of lock, for more than one purpose.)

Subject: IMAP difficulties
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Since upgrading to the new IMAP released recently, our users have been 
unable to delete messages in their inbox.  They are using a variety of 
clients, including Netscape Communicator 4.02 and PC-Pine 3.96.

The environment:

Pine 3.91 on an Ultrix box.  Everything worked properly with the IMAP 4.1 
beta release that was out before Pine 4.0.

The symptoms:

     I'm still collecting data.  The exact results are dependent upon the 
exact client configuration.  If Netscape is set to move deleted messages 
to the Trash folder, they are moved, but not expunged from the inbox (or 
marked deleted at the next login).  The Mac Netscape client reports

IMAP server responded
17 NO EXPUNGE failed
checkpoint file failure
permission denied

Anyone seen anything like this?

And the IMAP marker file appears as message number 1 in the Trash folder, 
not the inbox, or does not appear at all (varies for different users).

Yes, but if you were on *that* particular track, wouldn't it make sense to
do the following;
1. why not chop the To;'s, save a copy of the mail as a text file, and cat
the chopped To;'s into the text file just created?
>Some have suggested a process which chops off some of the To:'s and puts
>them in a safe place for later reference.
-
You wouldn't have to put things back together, if you wanted the "bare bones
version" (minus To:'s) it would be pruned 'n ready in the inbox. If you
wanted to view the whole horrible mess, well pico/emacs/jove/vi/LaTeX
(whatever) the (suitably titled) text file for the exquisite details.
>This seems fine for those inclined to do the work of putting things back
together.
-
I dunno Ed, if you can write the stuff to accomplish the task, er....I think
the 'puter just did make things easier...nicht so?
>However, it seems to defeat
>the purpose of having a computer to make things easier.

I would ask the question at this point....is the "average user" the one who
wants clean mail, minus all the To:'s? My sense of it is probably that's not
the case.
I've gotten the usual "funnies" forwarded (yet one *more* fwd) from
newcomers, and more sage users alike. Both groups blithely read and
forward/bounce email with the most atrocious list of To:'s on 'em. Maybe
it's only after a while that quality and style become an issue. Maybe it's
just us folks that agonize endlessly over matters such as this. I think the
crop of newcomers over the past couple of years or so regard all the crap in
badly composed email as "normal". It's the dumbing down of the Internet
poulation as a whole I think. If no one teaches you style, how do you become
a discriminating user?
Bottom line is this I think; Advanced users want advanced capabilities.
Absent those built in capabilities, the annoying stuff gets fixed by the
advanced user...in a an advanced way. The average user learns if interested
(and irked by the flaw) or lives with the problem in blissful ignorance or
uncaring oblivion.
>Also, it is seems to be solution which may be to complex for the average
user.

Yup, me for starters, though Gawd...how I wish........<sigh>
>(Not all users of pine have a Masters in computer science.  :-) )

Modifying Pine would probably be the way to go IMHO. A feature that would
enable you to view abbreviated To:'s would be the functional equivalent of
the "h" (show/hide headers) a feature that I personally find invaluable.
I vividly recall a distinguished fellow list member who seemed to be so at
home actually modifying a mail client to do his esoteric bidding (elm
emulation keymappings I think?), that he assumed immediate Godlike status in
my eyes :) Is it *that* easy? I think perhaps not!
>So, what choice is left?  Well, maybe there are 2 solutions.
[listing of proposed solutions]

Well, that's my $.02 worth,
I'm amazed that U.Wash modifies a globally used email prograsm in response
to user's suggestions at all!
That blew me away at the beginning, and still does. One of the dozens of
reasons I love the program.

Hi,

have you tried to set the TERM variable to vt100 or xterm before
starting pine; just to get it working?

(I'm sorry if they are already fixed in 4.02)

1. If sort order of a newsgroup is set to OrderedSubj and I unexclude
   deleted messages (&) and exclude them again (X), they are sorted in
   wrong order. Pressing $ Enter resorts them properly.

2. Postponing a composition or continuing postponed composition (I don't
   know which) adds extra newline at the end of the message.

3. When viewing the result of piping any message through cat (or other
   filter), the down arrow doubles newlines. Other scrolling keys work
   fine.

We are having precisely this minor problem at our site, 
We use /bin/mail -E to check for mail/new mail in our users' default
.tcshrc
 
/bin/mail -E
switch ( $status )
        case 0:
                echo "You have new mail."
                breaksw;
        case 2:
                echo "You have mail."
                breaksw;
endsw

This reports mail even when the inbox is empty because of the pseudo
message.  
	Does anyone have a simple notification agent that will check for
mail presence with the psuedo message.  Otherwise I will code a simple one
in Perl.  /bin/mail -E was due for a change anyway because the -E switch
and the return code 2 are both undocumented (deprecated?).

I went ahead and wrote a perl script to replace /bin/mail -e

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#to replace /bin/mail -e and ignore Pine 4.0x pseudo message
#takes single argument of mbox path or uses $ENV{MAIL}
#returns 0 if there is mail, 2 if there is new mail, 1 otherwise
#Michael Cope <mcope@hmc.edu> 
#This script is released under the same license as Perl

$magicsize = 515;                        # Pine 4.0x psuedo message size 
$mail = defined $ARGV[0] ? $ARGV[0] : $ENV{MAIL};
if(-e $mail) {
    ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
       $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
	= stat($mail);
    if ($atime < $mtime ) { exit 2 };    #new mail
    if ($size != $magicsize) { exit 0 }; #mail
}
exit 1;                                  # file does not exist or is empty

Michael,

> $magicsize = 515;                        # Pine 4.0x psuedo message size

Since this message contains items like the Fully Qualified Domain Name of
the system the size will vary from system to system.  Mine is 520.  Beware.

in 4.02 you can supress the psuedo message so you won't need to check for
it

Hi
I am from Turkey. I am using ISO8859-9 character set. I have a problem
with postponing a message. After postpoining a message, When I want to
continue to the message I won't get the message properly. I get the
message at the queue-encoded mode. For this reason I couldn't use the
postponing feature of the pine. What can I do for this problem. Is it a
bug?

Thanks for your answers ...

many thanks to the those responding to my termcap/terminfo inquiry.

what was not addressed, was what features pine is looking for in
termcap/terminfo before deciding if an entry is 'supported'.

it would probably take someone who knows the source code. for example,
do i need 'blink'? 'kend'? and so forth.

The first script has some bugs, the return values are the opposite of
/bin/mail -e and 0 length mboxes used by people using other mail agents
are flagged as having messages
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#to replace /bin/mail -e and ignore Pine 4.0x pseudo message
#takes single argument of mbox path or uses $ENV{MAIL}
#returns 0 if there is new mail, 2 if there is mail, 1 otherwise
#MTC 7/30/98

$magicsize = 515; # Pine 4.0x psuedo message size for orion.ac.hmc.edu
# THIS WILL VARY FROM SYSTEM TO SYSTEM and may change with Pine versions

$mail = defined $ARGV[0] ? $ARGV[0] : $ENV{MAIL};
if(-e $mail) {
    ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
       $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
	= stat($mail);
    if ($atime < $mtime ) { exit 0 };               #new mail
    if ($size && ($size != $magicsize)) { exit 2 }; #mail
}
exit 1;                                  # file does not exist or is empty

Subject: SunOS Pine 4.02 addressbook problem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've installed Pine 4.02 on SunOS 4.1.3 systems and have run into a
problem when trying to enter an addressbook entry with multiple
addresses.  For example, if I enter a new addressbook entry:

    Nickname  : test
    Fullname  : just a test
    Fcc       : 
    Comment   : this address contains a list
    Addresses : you, me, them

and try to exit and save this new entry, Pine crashes:

    No more available memory.
    Pine Exiting
    Arithmetic exception

I have installed this same version of Pine on Solaris (2.5 and 2.6), HP
and BSDi systems and this same addressbook entry causes them no trouble.
I have tried rebuilding this version of SunOS Pine using 'gcc' instead
of Sun's 'acc', to no avail.  It also happens whether or not I uncomment
the 'CHECK_QUOTAS' directive in ...src/pine/osdep/os-sun.h.

It looks like a bug to me.  Can anyone confirm this?  I didn't find it
listed in this discussion's archive on www.washington.edu.  Has it come
up before?  If so, is there a known workaround short of installing an
earlier version?  (It happens with Pine 4.01 as well.)

TIA.

As I've gathered from notes in headers.h and 
http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes.4.02/config.html#gen-conf
The -DTERMCAP_WINS doesn't have to be compiled into Pine anymore to get
the arrow keys to work on terminals.  Now, you can add
termdef-takes-precedence to the pine.conf or pine.conf.fixed file to
enable these keys.  

I added this, but it doesn't seem to work.  I'm not sure what's wrong
exactly.  I just took my 3.96 pine.conf and added that line.  Was that a
bad assumption that 3.96 pine.conf would work with 4.02?

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I subscribe to three e-mail lists.  On all three I receive the mail as a
digest at the end of each day.  On two of the three (both listserv) the
individual posts are included as attachments so that I can save them and
reply to them individually.  This is a *very* useful feature and I'd like
to receive Pine-Info in this format.  I'm trying to figure out what I need
to do, but I can't find the command in the listproc documentation.  Does
anyone know how I should proceed?  Will listproc even put digests in this
format?

I know this isn't a question about Pine, but it is a question about
Pine-Info, so I hope you'll forgive my digression.

Thanks in advance,

Mike
