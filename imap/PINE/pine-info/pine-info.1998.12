Subject: SCO 4.2 and rimapd
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Accept-Language: en
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

My organization uses two versions of the SCO OS i.e. Openserver 5.x and
SCO 4.2.

Our mailserver, running 5.x acts as a imap server to both 5.x and 4.2
machines. I've
compiled binaries for both OS versions. 

So here's the problem - Clients on any 5.x machines can successfully
pre-authenticate,
using the rimapd method, while clients on any 4.2 machine cannot.
On the 4.2 machines I've tested the user equivalency using the command:

rcmd imapserver exec /etc/rimapd    (NOTE: On SCO rcmd is the equivalent
to rsh)

This gives the a clean "PREAUTH .... server ready" prompt as expected. 

Another curiosity is that if I take the 4.2 pine binary and run it on a
5.x machine, pre-authentication works fine. (4.2 binaries will run on
5.x but not vice-versa.)

So the problem is not either with the imap server or the binary itself
but something to do with the environment on the 4.2 machine. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

The routine "update_titlebar_message" (lines 1289-1343 of screen.c in
pine4.05/pine) performs a "StartInverse/EndInverse" pair even if there
is no output between them.  This unnecessary output prevents my

man du

exit pine, and type du -k | more

Look for something that has a big number on the left side, and if you
don't need it, delete it.


If du -k |more doesn't reveal anything, then try this:

cd
ls -la

Look in the center of the screen, for something with big numbers.
Don't need it, delete it.

If all fails, call the help desk at UNC.


(sigh, this makes up for my posts to cmp, doesn't it???)

You are not asking in the right place. We cannot help you on this mailing list;
you must ask your system administrator.

You must also use capital letters at the beginning of sentences. Jeeze.

Assuming you are on a Unix system, the command "ls -a" will list all the files
in the particular directory, including hidden files that begin with ".".

Perhaps you had a session that crashed, resulting in a core dump. You may have
a file called "core" taking up all that space. Delete it.

"ls -al" will list all files, together with their length.

For more information, ask for help from your own system. No one on this mailing
list can help you; all we can do is guess.

This is a good question for your local system administrators since it has
to do with the _system_ quota, not any pine quota.  If you have shell
access, try the following (% stands for command prompt)
% cd ~
% du *

The listing that shows up should show the sizes of all files and
subdirectories.  Look for big numbers and delete things you don't need.
You probably also have files in an incoming mail directory.

You have to quit more by pressing Ctrl-C or q
Then you can delete the files with (% is shell prompt)
% rm filename
#deletes file 
% rm -r directoryname 
#deletes entire directory and all subdirectory
BE CAREFUL.  There is no undelete in Unix
If you want to be safer, try 
% mv filename /tmp
or 
% mv directoryname /tmp
then 
% cd /tmp
% rm filename
or
% rm -r directoryname

If you made a mistake in moving the file you can move it back with
% cd /tmp
% mv filename ~

Actually, I've learned to enjoy your style.  I was hoping you'd tear her
ass off!  You were so nice that she wrote back!

Yes, this list contains certain misfits who feel entitled, even obligated, to

Hi all

I have tried installing PC-PINE but i am getting some error messages while
setting up. If anyone of you can help me with this then i will be very
thankful to him/er. Please dont crib about it here.

Thanks,

Earlier i used to logon to my mailserver and then i used to check my
emails. Now i want to set up my mails on PC.

Here are the configuration setting for PINE 3.96 on UNIX

personal-name            = Nayan Jain
user-domain              = <No Value Set: using "tatainfotech.com">
smtp-server              = <No Value Set: using "127.0.0.1">
inbox-path               = <No Value Set: using "inbox">
folder-collections       = <No Value Set: using "mail/[]">
default-fcc              = <No Value Set: using "sent-mail">
default-saved-msg-folder = <No Value Set: using "saved-messages">
postponed-folder         = <No Value Set: using "postponed-msgs">
signature-file           = <No Value Set: using ".signature">
global-address-book      = <No Value Set: using
"/usr/local/addr/.addressbook">
address-book             = <No Value Set: using ".addressbook">

and the server where we used to telnet and open our account was
aaa.bbb.cc.dd (this is an IP address actually)

Now when i try to install PC - PINE then it asked me for following
parameters and i put these details. these setting are for PC-PINE 4.05

personal-name            = Nayan Jain
user-id                  = nayan.jain
user-domain              = tatainfotech.com
smtp-server              = 127.0.0.1
inbox-path               = <No Value Set: using "inbox">
default-fcc              = <No Value Set: using "sentmail">
default-saved-msg-folder = <No Value Set: using "savemail">
postponed-folder         = <No Value Set: using "postpond">
signature-file           = <No Value Set: using "pine.sig">

I am getting error when i try to open my inbox / send mail
it says that cannot find host 127.0.0.1

Even if i put aaa.bbb.cc.dd it says the same thing.
what should i put here and how ?    

I will be very thankful to you if you can help me

Thanks
Nayan ...!

Replace the 127.0.0.1 with bgate.tatainfotech.com 
BTW, you've used your one stupid question. 
Don't ask any more.

 Calling names, I guess this is just to show your  hrm.. maturity?

Last I checked, this list was for people with pine problems,
not those with such low self-esteem they have to result in insults.

OMG. You can actually be useful.

If it is pine related, and I can help him, he can ask any he wants too.
I still haven't found your name under the admin list of this list.

I guess because you have heard of loopback, everyone with a Unix account
should have as well.

 Maybe you should have stayed there.

Hi all

Thanks for all ur help...but i was not able to correct the error and make
PC-PINE run. Here i a, again giving you details.

Whenever you execute pine for first time it asks for all details regarding
config. here is what i gave.

Before that i would like to tell you settings regarding  pine 3.96 on
unix. 

Earlier i used to login to our compnay mail server
aaa.bbb.cc.dd as user "nayan.jain" and then on unix command prompt gave
pine command and was in my mails.

these were the settings...

personal-name            = Nayan Jain
user-domain              = <No Value Set: using "tatainfotech.com">
smtp-server              = <No Value Set: using "127.0.0.1">
inbox-path               = <No Value Set: using "inbox">
folder-collections       = <No Value Set: using "mail/[]">
default-fcc              = <No Value Set: using "sent-mail">
default-saved-msg-folder = <No Value Set: using "saved-messages">
postponed-folder         = <No Value Set: using "postponed-msgs">
signature-file           = <No Value Set: using ".signature">
global-address-book      = <No Value Set: using
"/usr/local/addr/.addressbook">
address-book             = <No Value Set: using ".addressbook">

server address aaa.bbb.cc.dd (this is an IP address actually)        

Now settings i gave at time of installing PINE 4.05

User-id for From address :nayan.jain
Personal name for From address : Nayan Jain
Host/domain for From address : bgate.tatainfotech.com
SMTP server to forward message :aaa.bbb.cc.dd
then it tried to send mail to pine centre for updation.
but it was not able to send mail. Also when i tried to get into inbox,m it
gives this error :- No inbox!  Folder to open as inbox :

here then i gave my UNIX based PINE's inbox path
{aaa.bbb.cc.dd}/usr/mail/nayan.jain

It tried to open the inbox, but then gave this error:-
  [Host not found (#11001): aaa.bbb.cc.dd]

well, please tell me what am i missing here...?

current pinerc settings ...

personal-name            = Nayan Jain
user-id                  = nayan.jain
user-domain              = bgate.tatainfotech.com
smtp-server              = aaa.bbb.cc.dd

Admit it, that's a luser way of thinking.
You do know what a luser is, don't you???

Looks to me like you didn't check.

LOL, only if the people listen.
Did you see that the guy did NOT do what I said??
And people wonder why I'm a BOFH.

No, it's not.
Again, it's painfully obvious that you have not read what this list is
about either. The list is not for stupid problems like this guy is having.
This list is for TECHNICAL discussions.

Good morning,

	It comes a time when a man realizes the errs of his ways. For me
this moment has just arrived. 

	I've been reading the pine-info (and trying to do my modest
contribution) for a while now, and more than learning about pine I've
learnt about pine-indo writers: fubar.

	For an excessively long time, I've been getting junk mail from the
list in amounts and quality resembling Microsoft help files. Never-ending
mail wars about - BEHOLD - signature length. Gosh. Flaming every poor
bastard who had the nerve to send the wrong message to the wrong
personnel.

	People. do get a life. And if that's too much for you, then at
least take some abridged course in common courtesy. Please. 

	I know what you're gonna say, in that polite, neat way of yours.
You don't have to read it if you don't want to. Well, I'm not gonna to.
I'm unsubscribing from the Pine Disgustionn Forum, finally. It's too bad a
very rotten apples makes the dish bad.

	Enjoy yourselfs, lads. On my part, if ever I need someone abused,
I'll ask him to mail pine-info@u.wash.

Why do people feel the need to announce their comings and goings?

Does that have anything to do with the purpose of this list?  I don't see a  
single post from you in the previous two months.... that's pretty modest.

May I draw your attention to the stated purpose of this list?

	The electronic mailing list Pine-Info covers features, bugs
	& workarounds, usage, installation, customization and more
	pertaining to the Pine software.  While unmoderated, it is
	intended primarily for discussion of matters of interest
	to systems/email administrators, developers, trainers, user
	support personnel, and others involved with Pine messaging
	on a "technical" level.

_Technical_ doesn't mean quotas, or random tag lines or any of the other  
stuff that has been popular around here lately.

If there were some actual technical questions going around, there might be  
some more use to this list.

TjL

EXCEPT ASK FOR HELP. THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT BLESSED W/ COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE

Maybe because they're so thoroughly disgusted with the whole situation
that they're making a (probably feeble, knowing several of you) attempt
to get you folks to wake up and help...not ridicule.

Some of us don't post regularly...rather, we help people outside the
newsgroup as it's too much of a temptation for several in here to 
make fun of everything that passes through here, which doesn't help
to answer the questions.  That doesn't mean we aren't out here
trying to accomplish things.

Weird.  I can't seem to find harass, ridicule, or belittle listed.
Did I miss something, or did you leave those out for a reason?

> _Technical_ doesn't mean quotas, or random tag lines or any of the other  
> stuff that has been popular around here lately.

Good point...so why do most of the posts not answer the questions, but
insist on complaining about sigs that are too long or something else
equally trivial and unrelated to Pine?  Those things aren't 'technical
issues' related to Pine, either.

> If there were some actual technical questions going around, there
> might be some more use to this list.

Hmmm...by technical, I take it you mean very specific technical
questions that most newbies don't even know to ask?  That makes a
lot of sense.  So, if this newsgroup isn't considered to be tailored
to the new users of Pine, why is it listed in the FAQ and on the
Pine Web site?  Guess maybe you'd better take those links off, Mr.
Gray or whomever happens to read this and is in charge of updating
that site.  Then, if that *is* the case, where *should* the new users
go to have their 'non-technical' questions answered?

Is there a pine-help list? 

maybe there should be a pine-help list for general usability issues, and
and this list for administrators.

-1 for profanity
-3 for the really lame personal attack. Somehow this always seems to come
up when someone wants to try and flame a techie. You obviously don't know
us very well, do you?

Global points off:

-3 for shouting. (I'm being generous here)
-3 for not being able to construct a basic sentence without murdering the

Well, since this really isn't the place to ask for newbie help, according
to the FAQ, you get what you ask for.

-1 for being stupid.

Stephanie, your credentials for favouring the subscribers to this
list with your views are even slimmer than those of the person you
are responding to.  And those are exceedingly slim: he is just a
gate crasher in an unmoderated list. 

How much did you pay for Pine?  The only payment that has been, by
implication, asked of you was to read the mail you were sent by the
list server when subscribing to this list.  That payment you have
withheld. 

The correct response to questions outside the scope of the list is
no response: to ignore them.  The context-sensitive help is, after
all, extensive, and that in the main menu contains a pointer to a
FAQ and other files.  

Some people are just plumb kind-hearted and liable to befriend
strays, but they should reply by direct personal e-mail. 

Therefore, any responses that are in fact mailed to the list are
likely to come from the dregs.  A response that is abusive yet
answers the question fails all tests.  Deal with it.  Don't bring
yourself down to the level of the person who made the response.

   I think Ken, as well as the others, should more importantly evaluate
their behavior, as to reflect the end-users opinions of Pine itself.
Joining the pine-info mailing list, and asking a question they can't seem
to find the answer to, and getting called names, and told to rm -rf *,
does not onlt reflect the posters "professional attitude" as they seem to
think members of this list must have. I think perhaps the hosters of this
list should take a serious look at the impact these few
need-to-insult-to-pump-my-low-selfesteem-drunks that ruin a good
mailing-list, and (the best?) Mail client's reputation.

  No, probably he finds himself as moderator of this list, you can see
these god-complez types all over, you just have to filter them all to
/dev/null .

  This makes me laugh, of course HE decides what is technical enough for
this list (see god-complex comment above).
  Of course from someone who is a beer-loving, plaid wearing, and a
self-proclaimed asshole, this is hardly surprising. Heck, "woods" is in
his name.

I understand that pine uses the pico editor. I was wondering if there's a
way to enable pico to automatically save if a post gets interupted by a
disconnect?

Thanks.

Myself, along with "the others" that you have referred to, have
decided that the pine-info list is going to be left alone. Y'all are
right, pine-info is NOT the place that we should continue our "antics"
Instead, we are going to concentrate on comp.mail.pine.

So, expect pine-info to drop back to what it was about two weeks ago.
Low traffic, wrong answers, and sheer stupidity.

Please do not send replies to this message.  They'll be pointless.
man procmail to figure out why.

I believe that is you do ^O  (Control+O) it will postpone the message,
then the next time you do "C" to compose a message, you will have the
option of starting a new one, or continuing with the old.

Provided you were probably drunk, like usual, when you wrote this,
I'll take my chances. 




sidenote: Thanks to anyone that helped deter these hoodlums from the list,
as they good have been a great asset, and it is a shame they had to act
that way. Perhaps we can turn this list into something useful.

Cheers.

^O will postpone if you still have an active session.

If the user is using Pine within a Unix account, I'd suggest listing the
contents of the home directory of the account with the command

ls -la                (ls -la|more if the list is more than one screen)

Look for a filename like             #pico123456789

where 123456789 is a long random number.

If you find one of those filenames and the date and time look about right
for when the session crashed, that should be where the contents of your
compose buffer went.  

What you can then do is start  Pine, open a compose screen, fill the header
out as usual,  and use ^R to read the contents of the #pico123456789 file
into the body of the message.

Clueful: Why do you set Reply-To? If your mail system automatically appends the
incorrect host name, set it yourself with "user-domain", the second option.
Only set Reply-To when you want to receive mail at another system.

The question is, "How can this list be of any use at all to postmasters and
system administrators if it is filled with questions that can be answered by
looking in the documentation?" Your answer is wrong.

>>Please do not send replies to this message.  They'll be pointless.

The only time Ken was drunk while posting was when he answered luser questions
without the necessary insult.

"as they good have been a great asset"

What do you mean?

You want to turn the list into something useful? Then post a question related
to running mail servers that use pine. Or answer one.

I would like to unsubscribe to this list because it has proved to be
filled with very crude and useless people (sorry to those who actually
helped me). But this list is, I guess, not the right place for my
questions. Hopefully I have made some realize that they should get a life
and stop the insults and just make a suggestion to help those of us who
are not "computer-talented". We learn quickly, ya know?
Please unsubscribe me from this list immediately.

You learn quickly, do you? Then learn this:

Never, NEVER send unsubscribe requests to the list posting address. List
members do not want to read them. Instructions for unsubscribing are given at
the URL below, added to every single message that goes through this list.

If you join another mailing list, SAVE the instructions on sending unsubscribe
commands to the list server.

How about some compromises?  Here is my list of ideas:

1) pine-info is too general in name
	pine-admin	Help on administrating PINE
	pine-bug	Bugs to squash (Is this already there?)
	pine-devel	Development of PINE
	pine-gurus	Another possibility of above.  I like this better;
			it may scare newbies away from it.
	pine-info	General help to others

	If anyone asks for help on anything but the help list (pine-info),
	I recommend not to flame.  Send them just the URL to the FAQ.
	(See point 3).

2) At the bottom of each message we should also post the URL to the
   FAQ instead of just a link to information about the list.  Some
   people might not know a FAQ is located at the mailing list URL.

3) The number answer in the FAQ should give a detailed explanation of
   the functions of each of the mailing lists with the help list
   surrounded by asterisks so no one may miss it.

4) If someone ignores a post--a polite post :)--telling them to read the
   FAQ, they may be flamed.  Ignorance is one thing, ignoring help--polite
   again--is another.


If anything sounds unreasonable, I can blame the cold medicine I am
taking.  :)

Those are all good suggestions.

May I point out, also: People looking for solutions will often join a list and
ask their question. To those who have been on the list for some time, it
appears that "those people" keep asking the same, inappropriate questions. And
so the flames begin. However, "this person" is not "those people", nor should
they bear the brunt of somebody's pent-up frustration with other people's
transgressions.

Metaphorically, if too many people come to your door seeking what you're not
selling, change the sign on the door!

Problem with that is, he's wanting to know how to recover from a
disconnect.  The only way to guarantee that you won't lose data
from that is to occasionally postpone, then exit or suspend the
pico job and save a copy of the postponed file.  I've done that
before when I have a squirrely phone line, or the ISP is having
modem troubles.  I've never seen pico consistently save during
a crash, so I've never relied on it too much.

I tend to assume everyone else that uses a unix shell knows and uses
screen.  I keep wondering how it is people get disconnects.

# w | grep winter | grep pine
winter   P0  3Cust235.tnt1.dc 13Oct98     -  (pine4)

Now, I would have had a longer running process but I restarted just for
kicks when I changed something in my .pinerc.

Anyhow, for everyone that doesn't use screen, go out and grab it, or if
you're not running your own boxes (as if most of the people are) try
typing 'screen' at your prompt.

Chances are it will be installed already.

Screen is one of the few things that you can't live without.  Its like
making a bash user use 'sh'.

  It can be useful to all. As they chose it to be unmoderated, it could
perhaps use a statement on their part on how technical this list should
be. I think that "clueless newbies" should have someone where to ask the
questions they can't find in the FAQ etc. Especially w/o being called
names by people like yourself, or being told to erase their valuable
files.

I'm sure calling list members lusers is a sure fire way of gaining
friends, as well as encouraging newbies to use Pine.

If you are not capable of figuring out the error in that sentence, you
weren't meant to know.

  I will try to answer any I can, and without calling names etc. I would
like people to remember the pine-info list as friendly, where they can go
when they get stuck, not a list full of hostile-hicks that wish they were
real sys-admins.

By chance I was typing a Pine message at the console about two
minutes ago when I became aware of a situation requiring urgent
attention (I had modem troubles).  Forgetting about my message I did
a few hasty and drastic things, finally shutting down and rebooting
the computer that Pine was running on.  It is a Linux computer and
it was an orderly shut down, i.e. processes were signalled. 

When it came up again I ran Pine and it immediately asked if I
wanted to continue editing the message that had been saved.  It
was intact.

So, if it's interrupted by a disconnect, I guess you'd be okay.

Hi all(these all means only people who have helped me)

Its me Nayan here who had asked some questions regarding PC-PINE problem. 
I am glad that i am on this list, and after some time i am just going to
be a was on this list. I am glad that i learnt a good lesson here. The
lesson is "There still are stupids,idiots,jerks in this universe, and by
mistake they have landed on earth and have joined this PINE LIST". I dont
know what people (the one who said all crap tp me when i asked for a help)
think about yourselves.Are you really that smart that you can answer each
and everything and know everything under the sky ?

People(rather stupids) like K.W. are maniacs and should be thrown out of
this list. This kind of behaviour is maligning PINE's impression on
public. 

I think the problems and questions i asked were justified and if any one
of you felt that it was out of topic here then could have directed me to
proper source rather than ridiculing...abusing.

Anyway, I mjust want to thank to all the guys who have helped me here, but
now i have dropped the idea of installing PC-PINE, nothing more is
required from PINE after these discussion.

Still i have a request that you can unsubscribe people of type K.W. from
this list and you should.

Anyway Thanks again !
Nayan Jain

The express statement is that it is for administrator-level issues. 
Why not believe it?  And the reason was surely to minimise traffic
and not bother the maintainers with user problems that local
administrators can handle.  To filter out what they don't want to
waste their time reading.

A clueless newbie is a person who has not read the FAQ.  If you have
studied the documentation you are not a clueless newbie.  It is vain
to try to help them, other than by pointing to the documentation.
Or undertaking to help all newbies by writing better documentation.
You might do this by creating an index to existing documentation.
 
If you are enthusiastic to help a particular clueless newbie you
will write a full and careful explanation in response to the
newbie's obscure plea for help.  But that is documentation, and it
is exactly why the original documentation was written, and what you
have just written is probably better and more accurately expressed
in the pre-existing documentation.  Remember, the original problem
was that the clueless newbie didn't and wouldn't read the
documentation.  Have you spent your time fruitfully, or have you
been made a fool of? 

What is needed is a footer added by the list server telling where to
look for further information.  I saw one today on a few of these
mails, and it was a very desirable improvement.  Presumably mail is
reaching me out of order, because it seems to have disappeared
again.

What is _not_ needed is the abuse that has been seen in this list.
If it is mail from a clueless newbie, simply pass on to the next
message.

If Selah is running M$ Windoze I wouldn't be convinced that is the case.
I do have a suggestion, though.

Pico is s standalone program as well as being incorporated into Pine as
the 'internal' editor. What you can try is configure Pine to use the
standalone Pico as your alternate editor ("editor" variable in config).
You can invoke it either manually with ^_ (<Ctrl>+<Underscore>) or have it
enabled implicitly ("enable-alternate-editor-implicitly" variable in
config). In either case you are then actually editing a temporary file on
disk, and even if Pine gets disconnected, the file can probably be saved
under a different name and pulled back later. Try and see (and tell us if
it works).

I actually always use an alternate editor for two reasons. First is that I
am used to 'vi' and prefer it to Pico. The second is that I have a
relatively poor connection to my IMAP server and even if the connection
acts up (no response from server for up to a few minutes), you can still
compose your text. If you get a flaky connection while composing with the
internal Pico, everything freezes up until the connection is
reestablished.

Cheers,
Jan

This is why a number of us (probably the majority) have him going direct
to /dev/null via procmail.

His posts are hardly missed.

Is there a way to setup PINE so that you can use foreign alphabets and
symbols from within PINE or to use non-english keyboards?

The purpose of this list is NOT to answer questions, the answer to which is in
the documentation. Clueless people can't find answers because they haven't
tried.

Because there are some administrators and bug announcers who do read the FAQ?
Also, the intended purpose of this mailing list (not newsgroup) is stated both
in the instructions for joining and in a message that is sent to those who
join.

How about comp.mail.pine?

> 1) pine-info is too general in name

I completely agree. pine-info used to be linked to comp.mail.pine
and they were both for the same type of discussion: general tips,
tricks, and help about Pine. If pine-info is now supposed to be
for more technical questions, then it should have a name that
reflects that. My vote is to call it pine-tech and to
bidirectionally link it to a newsgroup called comp.mail.pine.tech
so that people have a choice of participating via a mailing list
or newsgroup and so the discussion is archived at places like
DejaNews. For consistency, I'd also like to see comp.mail.pine
bidirectionally linked (again) to a mailing list, maybe called
pine-users. Here are some reasons I'd like to see both these
groups available via both news and mail:

NEWSGROUP IS NICE BECAUSE...
* Discussion is archived on DejaNews and other sites that archive
  Usenet
* Can use news readers to participate and news readers are
  usually much better at discussion-group features like
  threading and killing
* Don't have to subscribe to be able to participate


MAILING LIST IS NICE BECAUSE...
* You don't have to worry about messages expiring
* UW Pine lists are archived and available via IMAP, e.g.,
  news-collections={ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}#ftp/pine/pine-info/[]
  (they could probably do this with newsgroups too, which would
  be nice)

Someday I hope that newsgroups and mailing lists will both have
all the same positive features and none of the negative features
but until that day comes, I like giving people the option of
participating via either news or mail.

For now I think just two groups are enough (general and tech)
and I think the name "pine-info" should be retired. It's got a
confusing history (i.e., originally for general discussion and
currently for tech discussion) and it's not a very descriptive
name anyway.

Yes, the blurb at the bottom of each msg should mention the FAQ
(and possibly the purpose of the discussion group), but I think
that that can be done with only one URL. Here's a possibility:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 This list is for the discussion of Pine technical issues. User-
 level discussion takes place in comp.mail.pine. For information

Your "majority" - empirical evidence gathered by grepping cmp and this
list - is too stooopid to even spell procmail correctly. Which is why
this mailing list was made subscriber-only and its purpose "admin
problems". Now tell me, Ian, what does a luser PC-Pine problem have to
do on this list?

Even your flames are boring, Ian. And: your actively encouraging the
abuse of this list. You know, Ian, I think this is not a Good
Thing. Do you?

I suggest that if Bob feels he is in a position to volunteer that "those
people" shouldn't be flamed because they are unwilling to read the
documentation, then his e-mail box should be the official receptacle for
correspondence from "those people" to take the burden off of this list.

I further suggest that if Bob is not personally offering to take the burden off
of others, then he should not offer suggestions on what others should do.

The below list definitly holds true for this list :)))

Question:  How many mailing list members does it take to change a light
bulb?

Answer:     422.

One to change the light bulb and to post to the list that the light bulb
has been changed;
  14   to share similar experiences;
    7   to caution about the dangers of changing light bulbs;
  27   to point out spelling/grammar errors in posts about changing
light bulbs;
  53   to trash the spell checkers;
 156  to write to the list administrator complaining about the light
bulb discussion and its inappropriateness to this mail list;
 111  to defend the posting to this list saying that we all use light 
bulbs and therefore the posts are relevant to the mail list;
   27  to post URL's where one can see examples of different light
bulbs;
   14  to post that the URL's were posted incorrectly, and to post
corrected URL's;
     6  to post to the list that they are unsubscribing because they
cannot handle the light bulb controversy.
Oh yeah, and 6 to post to the list that the guy who sent the light bulb
joke has not got his arithmetic correct and that it only takes 416 list
members to change a light bulb.

George

just a thought: can ListProc be configured to insert a couple of lines of
text to every list message (I know majordomo can) - say:

-------
this list is for ....
before posting, please read the FAQ at http://.....

that might head off a bunch of inappropriate posts

Some people have said they'd like this group to be moderated or
that some people should be banned from the group. I'd rather see
the group stay open and that we do the following to self moderate
the group:

* Ignore abusive posts or if you feel you must respond to the
  abuser, respond privately.

* When someone sends an inappropriate message to the group, politely
  tell her that it's inappropriate and where is the appropriate
  place to get the information or ask the question. Do this 
  quickly so the person gets a polite response before an abusive
  one.

* Teach people how to use Procmail or Pine to "kill" abusive
  participants. E.g., in Pine you can kill someone by using
  initial-keystroke "macros." Here's how I would kill someone
  whose email address is abuser@abusersRus.com:

pine -P pinerc. -p pinerc-groups. -I G,"in-l-pine-info",CR,;,T,F,"abuser@abusersRus.com",A,D,X

Note that this is specific to my setup.  I have pine-info msgs
filtered into a folder named in-l-pine-info and I use a config
file called pinerc-groups to override some settings in my pinerc
file.

For this self moderation to work, we need to add info to the FAQ
about how to deal with abusive participants and how to "kill"
them.

What do other people think about banning some people and/or
moderation?

Unfortunatly, filtering causes all posts to be lost.
Yes, there are a lot of abusive posts, but even in
the harsh wording, the answer is "sometimes" also 
there. So you could lose valuable information by
killing all posts of a person.

Personally, I scan the message, hit delete if it's
not relevent. If it's relevent and I can use something
I'll reply back, if I can't use something and there
is some relevence to the post, I'll reply back

If the post is just bantering (or another b word)
and has no relevence to the question, click delete
and ignore.

Once someone realizes they can't get a rise with 
the inappropriate posts, they eventually stop
or you keep hitting delete.

True, it does waste time haveing to read them, but
it may also waste time by not reading them and missing
something important.

The first big question is whether you're using PC-Pine or UNIX Pine. If UNIX
Pine, what are you using for a terminal? In either case, Pine is fairly
limited, although more so in the case of UNIX Pine. The apparent design
assumption is that a particular user of Pine will work in only one character
set. This is set up in the configuration area. This may address your needs.

If you receive a message on a 'charset' other than what you're set for, Pine
will notify you when you read it, but UNIX Pine at least has no capability for
translating it. You CAN however, set up an external 'viewer' for messages in
different charsets, using a ".mailcap" file. What the viewer can do will of
course be limited by the capabilities of your terminal (emulator).

I am interested in corresponding (off-list) with people facing these issues,
and possible solutions involving our multi-lingual Windows telnet client.

Dearest Adam, as stated before, I will not reply to Clueful, so you

I *HAVE* to reply here, to a a paragraph I found:

* You may also be able to find the answer to your problem, if it has
       been discussed before, in the message archives of the Pine-Info
       mailing list. Note, however, that many perceived "Pine-problems"
       may actually have nothing to do with Pine itself, but be
       indicative of another problem on the system running Pine, so only
       your local computer support people will be able to ascertain and
       correct the cause.

I also found:

* The electronic mailing list Pine-Info covers features, bugs &
   workarounds, usage, installation, customization and more pertaining to
   the Pine software.


It also says it primarily for admins, but stating the above sentence,
and the fact it is unmoderated, be prepared to answer non-admin questions.
Until the new users have a place to ask there questions, this seems like
the only mailing-list they have to turn too. Also note, as said numerous
times for yourself and the other "slower" list members, there is no
place where it says "for name-calling (This includes "Clueful" btw, which
you obviously aren't, as well as luser.) and for directions to delete your
hardwork." 

So Adam, until you learn how to properly address me, and your elders, keep
reading.

  I applaud Bob for his efforts, as I agree with his email, and the fact
he has taken the first step. I've also decided this flame-thread is
getting rather boring, and have decided to keep any further
replies/flaming off-list, as it can go on forever, and this is not the
appropriate channel.

Again, my negligent friend, if Ian wrote this, perhaps it should be
directed to him. Flaming the admin-wannabies like Ken, for example, is
probably a good thing, however should be done off list.
Of course I run a server, a few actually, I guess that means I am "techie"
enough to remain on this list, as you seem to think you are moderator. As
well, anyone using localhost as smtp, must be a server admin, no?

 As I said before, if you would like to reply to me, and me to actually
read it, you can address it to Mr. Yashinski. It can also have "luser" 
and any other of you little names grep'd out if you want a response.
Also note I Cc'd you, to show my appreciation for your excellent knowledge
of names.
  Believe it or not, I admire you and Ken for your knowledge in Pine,
however until you can learn to channel it in a professional way, as
opposed to your normal drunk-kick antics, perhaps you should remain
unsubscribed, like Ken promised.

Okay, I don't often speak up, and when I do, it's usually to answer
technical questions (or very occasionally ask them). I think all of the
'old guard' here (Robin, Adam, Shoeless, Colin and the others) have clues,
and I think that it would mostly be agreed that I'm not a clueless luser
either. I've been on this list a year now, and I've seen times when the
list was definetly a community and the information was definetly useful,
and I've seen Robin flame people who really deserved it in some very
creative ways (And I have them saved somewhere, if anyone wants a repost
;) ), and then I've seen this. This is useless. We have had more flames
lately, and more boring, unoriginal flames, then I think I've seen in some
time here. I think the signal-to-noise ratio has gotten to the point where
it simply bites. If I want to listen to boring, snotty people whining
about pointless shit, I'll go watch talk shows. I assume everyone here has
an IQ above room temperature, and a maturity somewhat above middle school,
and I think we should act it.

As a suggestion, I think that when someone asks a really clueless
question, even a faq (perhaps esspecially a faq) a response with the
pointer to the answer and a gentle admonition to RTFM or RTFF would be the
most appropriate and most useful way of dealing with them. For example

> I can't use pine if I don't turn on my computer first. What's wrong?

Well, you'll find that it is impossible to design pine so that it can run
outside of the computer. More information on this may be found at
http://www.somedumbsite.com/really-stupid-faq. Please remember to read the
faq next time as it saves us time and energy in repeating our answer and
saves you time and energy waiting for us to repeat our answers.

Useful replies will be read and perhaps replied to. Boring flames and
replies that say "You must be a luser because you don't want us to flame
the lusers" will be forwarded to /dev/null.

If you want flame wars, read alt.flame or go to onelist and make your own
flame war list. This is about pine, and I don't have a problem with the
occasional weird discussion (making toast, anyone?) or the occasional well
written (intelligent and humourous are always good), deserved flame (or
even undeserved, if it's well written enough ;) ), but the boring,
pointless flame wars of recent have gotten very old. And no, I'm not going
to leave, because I happen to like what this list was, and I don't intend
to let it die simply because of a few, stupid flame wars.

That is an instruction to new users to check the archives before asking their
question on the list, an excellent admonition.

What is the appropriate channel to get you to end your own lack of etiquette
and discontinue your annoying practice of sending duplicate replies? Do correct
your own behavior first before looking for fault in others.

No one on the list cared whether or not you are bored with this thread. Feel
free to make no further responses.

I vote for moderation, and I will gladly ban anyone who refuses to read the

They certainly won't bother to read the FAQ.

The only true answer is a moderated list.

I'll offer to moderate it, and promise not to use a single coarse word (and  
certainly nothing like what Stephanie used) in any of my responses.

Um.... Yashy....  Robin has been on the list a LOT longer than you.

And who said anything about what is "not tolerated" on the list?

Who decides that?

We can't even agree that off-topic posts are not tolerated, and now you, a  
newbie, want to dictate to a long-time member?

You're not making a great impression by trying to put down Robin as  
"inexperienced" since he has far more knowledge about PINE than you or me.

Um.... you have replied to it, since you replied to the message AND mentioned it.

No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.  
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

Just because a list is unmoderated DOES NOT mean that we have to reply to  
off-topic posts.

They HAVE a place: comp.mail.pine.

How difficult is that?????

It is on the START PAGE for PINE at http://www.washington.edu/pine/#Contact

It is actually HARDER for them to find out about the mailing list, which  
then explicitly states:

	The electronic mailing list Pine-Info covers features, bugs
	& workarounds, usage, installation, customization and more
	pertaining to the Pine software. While unmoderated, it is
	intended primarily for discussion of matters of interest
	to systems/email administrators, developers, trainers, user
	support personnel, and others involved with Pine messaging
	on a "technical" level.

'administrators, developers, trainers, user support personnel, and others  
involved with Pine messaging on a "technical" level.'

It is clear enough, if people bother to read.

They don't.

Do we give up and let the list be a duplication of the FAQ and the newsgroup?

I say no, a thousand times no.

Just being able to subscribe to a list does not allow you to dictate what is  
acceptable for that list.  There are rules, and you need to follow them.

It's not complex.

You don't need to lockfile /dev/null

Also, your From: line will never match anything as-is, you need a .* before  
the @ and a space after the colon, preferably a tab or space option

Oh, and you should escape the . too so it doesn't match as a wildcard.

:0
* ^From:[ 	].*@kens\.com
/dev/null

There's a space then tab in that [ ]


Hey, if we're going to go offtopic into procmail recipes, let's at least get  
them syntactically correct.

Yep, that'd be good.
Filter a whole domain.

[/etc] uname -n
kens.com
[/etc] wc -l /etc/passwd
  2532 /etc/passwd
[/etc] 

Let alone the fact that I've only posted 3 messages since Friday, all of
them constructive.

You people /really/ need to get over me, and move on.

Or filter me.  Whatever.
But, for christs sake, do it correctly.

Odd, cuz I haven't seen mail from Ken in about 2 months, or about when I
added this little recipe. Mebbe it just happened to randomly work.

The second colon in the first line of the recipe

:0:

is a lockfile which gets placed on the "mailbox", which is the 3rd line of  
the recipe

/dev/null

so it will create /dev/null.lock to keep other files from being written to  
/dev/null at the same time.

Lockfiles are used to prevent corruption of the mailbox.  In this case,  
since the mailbox is /dev/null, it makes no sense to have a lockfile on it.

That is strange.  It "shouldn't" work because it isn't "correct" but if you  
say so.... still, as a model, there are improvements I would suggest in an  
attempt to achieve correctness even when it doesn't seem 100% in all cases.

(for example, your recipe could match @kensicom.com or any other domain name  
with a 'kens' and 'com' separated by one letter.... just happens to be that  
the email you want to filter has that one letter as a '.'  Real procmail  
fanatics would have you use \< and \> to delimit beginning and ends of  
strings, but I never got into that personally)

ps -- please do not CC me on any further replies, I'm on the list and don't  
need/want/desire/appreciate getting duplicate emails.  Thanks

For what it's worth, here's my $.02 on this issue:
1. I used to get irate at flamers, as well as lusers.
That was before I really got into procmail and accumulated
 an healthy appreciation for it...ummm, maybe that's not exactly the point.
2. More likely the point is this, a delete key works just like procmail.
	Flamers vs lusers:
1. Sometimes, we inadvertently incite the flamers by protesting to/about
their rants,                   insults and generally supercilious nonsense.
2. To flame a newbie (or other non-faq reader) is counter-productive,
*except* in the most extreme circumstances.
	Moderation vs Open List:
1. I used to be an advocate of a moderated list, not so any more I must
admit. We have to be able to exchange opinions without a human filter.
2.If anyone here belongs to the HTML Writers Guild, you will know that
there's an example of a moderated list gone nuts. One sentence that doesn't
relate *exclusively* to the topic is crunched by a "censor" (sorry
"moderator"), with elaborate repetitive posts pounding home the point. After
a while, the moderator is the offender! It's also a humorless environment
BTW.
Conclusion: Open beats moderated hands down
	Other Issues:
In my opinion, the FAQ's themselves could be better written. They are
written as though the reader knows the subject well, and is referring to
them as a memory refresher only (like man pages).
Having said that, I'm gonna get flamed for it I know...ah well c'est la
guerre. The most likely response may well be; "if you believe they are so
badly written, do the whole Pine community a favor and  re-write 'em" Well,
I'm not going to do that. It's an observation only...period.
If the newbies can't be practioners of common sense, and the flamers have to
be excessively demonstrative of their enhanced knowledge level, and the
readers cannot tolerate the expanded discussion..there's:
	a) procmail
	b) the delete key
	c) Unsubscription
Moderation is a word with innumerable possible definitions. It's a quality,
a necessity when exchanging opinions in a civilized society. No one asks
that another hold a "moderate opinion". The opinions we all hold on various
subjects are sacrosanct unto the holder. We ask that others express that
opinion or position with conviction and passion. The manner of delivery must
be moderated when the sensibilities of others are concerned. As has been
said; " I disagree with your position, but I shall defend to the death your
right to express it"
The absent factor in that equation is civility. Civil discourse is a
foundation of the political process. It doesn't dilute the subject, it
merely allows the principals to exchange strongly held views with clarity,
and absent the passions that accompany the riposte to a percieved insult or
slight.
As said above, that's my $0.02 worth, delivered civilly and with profound
respect for the real contributors to this list, (all of whom know more than
I do BTW)
To my frend Robin (before his defection to kens.com, but still my friend
nonetheless)

Umm, on Sunday 7/26/98 I posted the following, specifically to deal with
Ken....
<snip>
If anyone has procmail set up, this is the perfect way to silently banish
Ken, his rantings, profanity, and generally offensive behavior...

	  :0
        *^From:.*@kens.com
        /dev/null
Then, I did some reading (Ken, it's called RTFM OK?) and came up with the
following, which is probably *the* correct way to deal with the Kens of
this world...tank their mail, and autorespond 'em, informing them of said
fact!

    # This recipe will generate an autoreply header and bounce this
    # nastygram back
    # to the sender.
    # Note the lack of a c flag which means that we never see this mail.

    :0
    * ^From: .*@ kens.com
    | (formail -brt ; \
      echo "I'm ignoring your mail because you are offensive." ;\
      echo "Your email was automatically rejected by Procmail." ;\
      echo "Sooner or later, you will learn humility." ;\
      echo ""; \
      echo "                                 -me" ;\
      ) | $SENDMAIL -oi -t

<blah blah blah>

</snip>
But then again, he probably /dev/null'ed all my posts anyway, so he probably
never read it. I haven't read anything from him since then, so I have no
clue. By the way, for the sake of bandwidth preservation, I tanked the
autoreply, since others share the network too, but you get the general idea.
Don't lockfile /dev/null BTW, it's unecessary. There's something else that
should be escaped, I think it occurs right after kens.com, but I'm too
braindead to put it together. What you have above will work though.
The problem with this is that you will miss anything Robin writes, since
he's a user on the kens.com machine...which is a pity, since what Robin has
to say is not only relevant, but acquired through self learning, which is
doubly valuable. Robin doesn't use bandwidth for useless profanity, at least
what he says is in context, and can be a dose of reality.

You people need to get a grip.  

I've HONESTLY _tried_ to let this stuff die down.
However, you are all feeding off each others "KW is an asshole" messages.
Pretty soon, I'm going to be the cause for all of the problems on the
planet, as well as the reason that pine doesn't have "XYZ" features.

Guess what people???
I've posted exactly TWO messages since Friday, and both of those were
helpful. 

However, still, the major topic of conversation seems to be "How big of an
asshole is Ken Woods" [1]   Get over it already!!!

Those of you that are long time members know this pattern, as we've been
thru it before.

1. lusers get on my nerves
2. I vent. [2]
3. Everybody complains and calls me an asshole [3]
4. I stop venting.
5. lusers start asking stupid questions again.
(goto step 1)

The whole cycle takes about 6 months to go thru.
It's been happening for years. It's like the sun and the moon.  There's
nothing you can do to stop it.  It's going to happen.  Don't fight it.
I'm not going to change, and neither is the pine-info list.

Bascially, just stop. I've said that I was going to leave the list alone,
and try to be constructive.  

procmailing the whole domain, along with 2500 users, is NOT the answer.

[1] For those of you that don't know, that's a self-proclamation...see
www.kens.com for details

[2] Me venting, includes profanity.  Profanity stirs emotion.  That's my
ONLY purpose in using it.

Actually, I'm only talking about pico - not pine. The problem isn't
happening with pine - it's happening with slrn. Also, we're using a shell
account on the isp, (we also have a ppp account but prefer to use the
shell alot of times cause it's much faster.)

Subject: Externally forced check for new mail
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Sender: ceg@psdg.jpl.nasa.gov
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

This email includes a patch to provide a way for another process to force
a running PINE process to check for new mail.

My incoming email is sorted (by procmail) into various local files, which
PINE monitors as Incoming-Folders.  If the procmail process could force
a new mail check after delivery, I could increase my mail-check-interval
from 15 and yet get instant notification of new mail.

The patch adds a handler for SIGUSR1.  Patterned after the handler for
SIGWINCH, receipt of the SIGUSR1 signal causes the next check for input
(or the currently active one, if any) to return a NO_OP_IDLE, simulating a
mail-check-interval timeout.  Additionally, the "new_mail" code is flagged
to force a check regardless of the actual timeout status.

The following patch fixes a small race condition in the handling of the
SIGWINCH signal:

  	return(KEY_RESIZE);
      }
  #endif /* RESIZING */
  
      switch(res=input_ready(time_out)){
======== end patch ========

Refering to the original code, if a SIGWINCH signal should be received
after the test of "winch_occured" on line 197, but before the setting of
"ready_for_winch" on line 212, the signal handler will simply set
"winch_occured" and return, delaying the KEY_RESIZE return until after the
next keystroke or mail-check-interval timeout.

The patch corrects this by checking "winch_occured" again after setting up
the jmp_buf "winch_state" and enabling it via "ready_for_winch".

Subject: Wu-Pine Wu-Imap errors
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello all.

I am a new member to this list.  I have been trying
to diagnose a problem with I have been having with
Pine 4.05 and WU-Imap4.4/4.5.  I am running pine on
RedHat 5.1, the server on slackware 3.  Both on
p5-100 systems with 32 meg ram.

The problem is that every few minutes Pine's open
mailbox gets closed with an "CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS
ERROR" message.  On the server, this message is
logged in /var/log/messages "Dec  7 14:45:34 sec022
imapd[21612]: Fatal mailbox error user=support1
host=xxx.xxx.com [255.255.255.255]
mbx=/home/support1/New Mail: Unexpected changes to
mailbox (try restarting): F"  At this point the Pine
email client stops functioning properly (can't read
messages) and I have to either restart Pine or move
to a different mailbox on a different server and then
move back.

I have researched this on the pine-info archive and
dejanews.  And I have found that this is a "feature"
on recent versions of the Washington University Imap
server.  The problem is that multiple processes are
accessing the imap mailbox at once.  This could be
sendmail and a Pine client.  Could be two pine clients
reading at once.  imapd used to switch to a readonly
mode when this happened, but the designers removed
this readonly mode to conserve memory (at the
complaints from many users complaining that imapd is
a memory hog) and instead close the connection.  They
have no plans
to ever re-impliment this mode.

Pine is the only mail client that I have found that
finds this to be a problem.  Netscape and IE are
not even fazed by this, they simply connect again.

Here is my question, how do I fix this problem? 
Preferrably on the server side.  I have heard one
suggestion that using qmail and maildirs with imap
would fix it, but I have found the qmail IMAP patches
to be slightly kludgy, either not working or leaving
apparent junk in the mail dirs (my CEO is obsessed
with clutter....).  Does anyone know of any other
ways to fix this?  Does the Cyrus imap server have
this problem?  I have tried to use it in the past, but
ran into problems.  The Sendmail/Procmail/Imapd team
is much cleaner.  Is there an option in pine what
would tell it to just reconnect?

I have found Pine to be an excellent mail client.  So
far I have managed to find a configuration option to
fix every problem that I have had....

This problem only rarely shows up with less used users.
Through this one imap user we have three connecting
clients and about 20k messages a day (most of which
are filtered by Procmail).  That is why I see the
problem every few minutes ;)

Thanks to everyone for reading this!  I'm open to any
suggestions.  I would prefer to stick with
wu-imapd/wu-pine, but would consider changing either
or both of these if it fixes the problem.

I have same problems on Digital Unix 4.0D while using pine 4.05.
I'd to mention, that I posted similar question a month ago, no response!
I'm using only pine, however, system runs sendmail/procmail, 
Qualcomm popper 2.53 and Imap 4.1. However, I do not use any pop3 or imap
clients to read messages.

Pine dumps core when it detects new message in INBOX. That's most often
when quitting pine, while it most probably wants to _update_ INBOX and
delete some messages. it happens also when you for example delete all you
new messages in some previous session, and when messages are delivered
during your new session.

DBX Fault: Segmentation fault

When I investigated the problem with dumped cores from full-debug
binaries, it seemed that pine "correctly" exits because of SIGKILL or
SIGHUP. 

In some rare cases pine reported "CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR" while
reading messages. But again, most often it dumps while browsing INBOX and
new message appears or while quitting.

It seems that turning off the option mail-check-interval made the problem
less frequent.

I'm also waiting for some patches. ;)

Using an index-format of:
    STATUS MSGNO SHORTDATE3 FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)
in an 80 character wide screen (with a folder with less than 1000
messages) yields field widths of:
    STATUS     =  3
    MSGNO      =  3
    SHORTDATE3 =  8
    FROMORTO   = 17
    SIZE       =  8
    SUBJECT    = 36

However, replacing SHORTDATE3 with SHORTDATE4 i.e.:
    STATUS MSGNO SHORTDATE4 FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)
yields field widths of:
    STATUS     =  3
    MSGNO      =  3
    SHORTDATE4 =  8
    FROMORTO   = 25
    SIZE       =  8
    SUBJECT    = 28

The incorrect percentage width calculation is caused by a minor typo,
which can be fixed by the following patch:

Subject: [4.04] problem with Global addressbook
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-To: Pine Discussion Forum <pine-info@u.washington.edu>
X-Sender: ujefsh81@spike

It seems that some aspect of global addressbooks was changed in 4.04.
I can only find a short reference to it in the release notes.

After installing 4.04 (and 4.05), I found that my global addressbook
was no longer available for use. As soon as it was accessed, it became
Un-Readable and showed the following error message :

     /some/path/.addressbook : Cross-device link

I know this error comes up when you try to make a link to a file located
on a different physical device. The solution is usually to create a
symbolic link. Here, the global addressbook is on the same device (same
partition) as my users home dirs, but my pine executable is not. I am
running Solaris 2.5.1 . I restored 4.03 and the problem didn't recur.

Can anyone suggest a solution to my addressbook troubles so I can 
install 4.05?

Thanks,

Jeffrey,
   That should work ok. This comparison is now done in a smarter way that
doesn't depend on system load in Pine4.05. Thanks.

I'm told that at least some VMS-based IMAP servers do not do new mail

The point is this:  Every time you put a new file in your file cabinet, it
takes longer to sort the files, right?  How many hundred messages do you now
have in your "read mail" folder?

There is supposed to be MH folder support via folder names beginning
with #mh/ but it seems to be read only, i.e. you can't create such a
folder.  If you could, I think it would solve the problem of slow
sorting of mail when there are many items.  Then, each mail item
would be a separate file.

Ahh, that explains it. Take a look at the Pine FAQ, specifically topic
3.17. An excerpt from the FAQ: Pine will start a POP3 session and keep it
open until the mailbox is closed. Due to the nature of the POP3 protocol,
Pine will not see any new mail which arrives during the POP3 session. 

I believe that answers your question.

Cheers,
Jan

I wonder if others are seeing this problem: when selecting messages
based on subject text and using ^X to take the subject from the
current message, only some of the messages with that subject are
selected.  The obvious answer is that the subject text is different in
some way that is not immediately apparent.  For example, just now this
occurred because there was a space on the end of the subject for some
of the messages (including the one ^X'd) and not on the others.  But I
was aware of that potential problem and in some previous instances
I've verified that there was no space on the end.  Is there some other
"invisible" difference I should look for?

Meanwhile, I would recommend to the Pine implementors that a space on
the end of the subject search string should be ignored.

And while I'm at it, two of my current selection wishes:

  - match on text in either To or Cc fields (rather than having to
    select on To and then broaden with a selection on Cc)

  - when narrowing the selection, to only look at the messages in the
    current selection, rather than searching them all again and taking
    the intersection (which is slow for big files -- please no flames
    about keeping files small)

The following appeared on the Majordomo mailing list.  It appears
that GNUS recognises the header Mail-Copies-To which prevents
responses to the newsgroup from being mailed.

The idea for an MUA could be that a header could be set by default
such that if there was a To: which was not the recipient's address,
and the header in the original mail had survived the original
journey, the reply would go to the To: address, not the From:
address, by default.

The problem is that some mailing lists, including this one, don't
set "Reply-To:" to direct replies to the mailing list.  On such
lists there are periodically furious complaints mailed by people who
have received duplicates, one directly and one via the list, and who
are in any case prone to furious complaint over trifles.

As someone else contributed, lists that set Reply-To: [e.g. the CERT
Advisory list, Forens-L and many others] seem to not have
complaints over list operation.  I suppose, though, that their
servers have somewhat heavier load per subscriber.

The ability to set such a header by default, and respect it when
set, could provide the benefits of Reply-To without whatever
disadvantages discourage its use in some quarters.

I know that someone will say that instead of yapping about it I
should contribute a patch, but I personally am not particularly
bothered by such duplicates.  Perhaps one of those who are prone to
complain could take up the idea.

But if you really don't like the duplicates, help us out.  I use Gnus, so a
Mail-Copies-To: never header would have eliminated that CC.  One day there
will be a standard for this.  Until then, fix it on your end or stop
expecting people to be mind readers.

It's called Gnus, GNUS died a couple of years ago.

Taking into account that this is not a list for user questions, it is safe
to assume that everyone here knows what they're doing. It seems a good idea
to change it.

Gnus doesn't show the mentioned behaviour by default, however, and something
like this is still on the wish list: `C-f C-t' should ask the user whether
to heed mail-copies-to: never. I would consider this a good feature in pine.

I sense a slight misunderstanding here. IIRC, this is meant for Newsgroups,
where "X-send-copies-to: never" is to prevent Cc:s. Correct me if I'm wrong,
because I cannot find this in the Gnus info files.

But while we're at it: there is another feature of Gnus (and mutt) that seems
desirable. In Gnus it's called posting-style, in mutt folder-hook. It's a
function that lets you set e.g. your email-address depending on which folder
you're in. Very nice.

That would be a nice feature.  I currently have several incoming mail
folders, and a feature to automatically set up my e-mail address would be
great.

Does it alter the From: or Reply-to: headers?

I can only speak for Gnus:

`gnus-posting-style-alist'
  value: 
  ((organization . message-user-organization)
   (signature . message-signature)
   (signature-file . message-signature-file)
   (address . user-mail-address)
   (name . user-full-name))

At least that's what it does by default. I've once hacked it to do some
X-header stuff as well. Wasn't worth the trouble, but changing the from:
header on the fly is kinda nifty.

I have been working for several weeks on a problem with
PINE freezing up on terminals under HP-UX 10.20.  We used
the pre-compiled binaries from the U of Washington site.

Mail sending and receiving works fine.  But when staff are
reading a message and use the arrow keys to scroll up or
down in a message, the terminal will freeze up after 
scrolling a few lines or sometimes a few pages.  

I have been trying different settings in the /etc/gettydefs
file.  I have been able to improve the situation, but not
eliminate it.  

If we use PICO as a stand alone editor, we see the same
behavior.  VI works fine.

As I understand, by default, PINE and PICO use TERMCAP.
I am willing to re-compile with TERMINFO.  

My question to the list is:  Am I looking in the right 
places: gettydefs, TERMINFO/TERMCAP?  I have not seen
other reports of this behavior on this list, so I am 
assuming I have a problem on my system.  Has anyone else
seen this problem?

Some mail gateways, transport agents, and clients (including pine) delete
trailing spaces.

Hm. I can't think of any reason why trailing spaces shouldn't be ignored during
select.

Perhaps "Re: " at the beginning or that Microsloth convention at the end
" - Reply"? Not ignoring the first is really lousy searching technique.

I've searched the archives for this, but haven't found anything.  I 
apologise if it's all old hat to you.

We have used pine as our email front-end on our Unix box for several 
years now, and have found it most reliable.  However, I'm getting one or 
two problems, associated with email sent with MicroSoft Outlook.  One 
student as good as accused me of tampering with his mail. The message was 
in his spooled mail file, but did not show up on an INBOX listing.  The 
mailx front-end, which is pretty basic, could see the message.  In 
another case, the Outlook message and a 2nd message were attached to the 
end of another message - pine couldn't detect any separation between the 
Outlook message and the messages fore and aft of it.  Again, I had to use 
mailx to split them up.  The only common factor so far has been MS 
Outlook 8.5

We are using pine 3.91, our email server is sendmail 8.8.8 and our 
delivery agent is /bin/mail, as supplied with Solaris 2.5 

I'm not sure where to start on this, and would value your views.

Following some prompting from Mike Brudenell at York (thanks Mike), here
is more information.  Pine is accessing the spooled mail direct  i.e. not
POP or IMAP.  We are using an old version of pine, on the grounds that
"if it ain't broke don't fix it".  However, if these symptoms mean it's
broke, then we'll move to a newer version to fix it!

Subject: Viewing attachments - suffix not saved.
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I was not able to find this problem in the archives, so I am reporting it
here.

When pine uses mailcap for viewing MIME attachments, it creates a
temporary file /var/tmp/<filename>, where <filename> is of a form:

img-<ABC><NNNNNN>

ABC is a three uppercase characters which seem to be derived from MIME
subtype (I am not really sure about it), while
NNNNNN is Pine PID padded on the left side with 0's. Unfortunately, Pine
drops the original file extension (suffix). E.g., if the attached file is
file.doc, the temporary file name may be something like img-MSW003462.

Some viewer programs are content if they are fed files without a proper
suffix, others are not.

In my situation, the problem is even worse. For reasons beyond the scope
of this posting, I have to pass attached files through a script which
deals with many file types and gets input from many programs. This
script has no way of knowing what the original file used to be.

So my suggestion is to keep the original file suffix, so that the
temporary file from my example above will look like img-MSW003462.doc.

Is there a workaround?

Andy

Marie,
You are in the best position to determine whether or not a newer version
of Pine will fix the problem, since most of us do not experience your
symptoms... I can assure you that more than a few things have changed in
the four years since 3.91 was released.  Mostly improvements, we think :)

We're intentionally leaving the trailing space so that you can match
_word_. We'd like to not introduce any quoting mechanism like " word ",
since that'll just confuse people and it hasn't been like that before. A
possible change that might make sense (to us) is to strip the trailing
space when you type the ^X command to get the subject from the current
message, but we lean towards leaving that the way it is now, too.

We solved this problem by telling mailcap to run a shell script, telling that
script also (via a parameter) the MIME type, which we then parsed with a 'cut'
command. The script then in effect created a new file name, appending the
extension (derived from the MIME type) to the temporary file name.

I favor this change -- it would solve this particular problem for me.

As I mentioned in my message, I think there are also some other cases
where the subject match partiallly misses and no trailing space was
involved (I believe).  I guess nobody else has experienced this.  I'll
try to investigate more thoroughly next time it happens.

It is most likely a matter of "innovative" headers that later
versions of pine can handle.  You have no problems with mailx, and
are receiving the mail by SMTP using sendmail 8.8.8, i.e. the
separations must the there, so it is unlikely that the problem is
anywhere else.
 
Your pragmatic course is to upgrade and see if the problem persists.

If it does, take a look at the headers of the offending mail and
see if they verify against RFC 822 and RFC 1132.

You have convinced me that matching trailing space is useful. But a more
powerful searching method would be nice that would let us use metacharacters.

Steve, how about introducing a method of ignoring leading "Re: " and variants?

How about putting ^X on the submenu under ";" or at least "text"? It would save
quite a few keystrokes.

Hi,

I am attempting to run a moderated mailing list using pine and have a
problem.  My mailing list software sends a perspective message to me and I
approve it by adding an Approved: header to it.  I do this with the custom
headers option.  However, the bounce (b) from the message reader command
doesn't let me add a header so it doesn't keep the user's from address
when I forward.  It there a clean way around this anywhere in pine?
Thanks in advance for your help.

Are you using Majordomo? if not, you should be, I run all my lists with
it, and it is quite configurable.

I'll answer the question even though this thread is completely off-topic to
pine-info. Please, no replies on the list.

I assume this is Majordomo? This is a Majordomo FAQ. Your Majordomo
distribution has a file called "list-owner-info" in the doc directory with
clear instructions for performing this work manually. If you have permission
from your system administrator to run perl scripts and to invoke the Mail
Transport Agent (often sendmail), you can run the "approve" script. This is
also part of the Majordomo distribution.

To do this manually, forward the message to the list posting address. Cut out
everything at the top of the body before the ORIGINAL message's headers. Add an
Approved: [password] line before the message's original headers. Be sure there
are no intervening blank lines. Be sure to cut out your .sig file. Be sure to
cut extraneous matter pine adds at the end of forwarded messages (-------end of
forwarded message-------).

As a variation, export the bounced message to a file. Delete everything above
the original message's headers, add the Approved line, read the file into the
body of a message to be sent to the list posting address.

The method you describe, adding an Approved header, is to approve your own
messages sent to the list. You need not do this in the headers, though. You can
put an "Approved: [password]" in the first line of the body, followed by a
blank line, then the message text.

I remember a bug of just this nature in Pine 3.91. IIRC an embedded 00
character caused pine to think that the inbox ended there, so in effect
all subsequent messages appeared as part of the last one mentioned in
the index.

Workaround is to find the 00 and patch it to something else!

Fix is to upgrade.

Today Pine decided to start core dumping when it tried to send an
attachment.  "Received abort signal" and then it core dumps (as shown in
the .pine-debug1 file).

We've been running this version of pine for a long time (many months).
The ONLY thing that has changed recently is that the infamous "mailbox
vulnerable" error came back.  I did a "chmod 1777 /var/mail" and the error
went away.  This has been the only change, but now no attachments.  

I searched the archive but didn't notice any solutions to this.  Any
ideas?  (I'd upgrade to pine 4.05 but it has a bug on my platform.)

We're sort of stuck with the semantics of Search that exists in the IMAP
protocol. In IMAP search for text strings is always a simple search for a
substring match. No metacharacters.

There is already a method but I guess it isn't what you want. You edit the
search string and remove the Re: and variants, then the search will ignore
them (since it is a substring match, not an exact match).

You mean a shortcut to get to the current subject with a subject search
command? Everybody probably has their favorite searching style and they'd
want theirs on the menu. (how about a shortcut for everything arriving
since the current msg, or for everything from the author of the current
msg, ...)

Ah, that's interesting. I guess that also explains why searching isn't
available for text strings in other messages in the same folder while paging
through a message, only from the index screen.

Heh; that's what I do now. I was hoping for a better way.

Now your talking! But since the keystrokes for Current From, Current To, and
Current Subject don't duplicate other keys, it would be nice to be able to use
them sooner.

Hello. I'm new to the list. I've got a question about pine from the user
end that someone might be able to help me with:
Is it possible to edit the flags in the message index of the inbox folder?
That would consist of erasing or adding "A" (answered) flags at this
point, but how come that's the only flag avvailable? I'd like to be able
to mark certain incoming messages with a flag so I remember to answer them
later, or to ensure that they don't get erased, etc. Any ideas?
Thanks.

How can I edit messages saved in my sent-mail folder without moving them
and without changing their status?

The best way to do this is to get hold of "approve" perl script from the
majordomo distribution site (assuming you are using majordomo). You should
then use the "pipe command" or "|" in pine to pipe the approved post to
this "approve" script. This script will automatically attach the required
Approved: password at the top of the file and send it back to the mailing
list for distribution.

You will require a .majordomo file in your home directory with the
following information:

  your-list@somewhere.com  your-passwd  majordomo@somewhere.com

After thinking about this for awhile... I also upgraded our DG/UX
operating system last weekend.  Are there any sendmail or other related
MTA programs that pine works with that are known to conflict?
