Hi Scott,

THANK YOU VERY MUCH for this reply! :) It's good to know that:
a) I wasn't imagining things, and
b) Someone out there had an answer!

That being the case, I'm just a bit curious as to where you got this
answer--as it was in obviously in another forum separate from this one,
one that seems to be more receptive to questions...

Would you be kind enough to provide me with that information (as it was
not included in the forward below)?  Thanks again--oh, any idea on when
the next release might be, btw?

							BINO

I got it by virtue of my position as a student and staff member
(supporting Pine, among other things) here at the UW.  I sent in a
question to our help system, and that's the answer I got.

I haven't heard anything on when the next version of Pine might be out.

Ahh, ok--I understand, and thanks again--I was wondering what code the
143686Q was for, and now I get it--I was hoping it was a resource I might
be able to use, but I guess not.

On a similar note then, know anything about why Pine queues all keystrokes
made to the console?  It didn't use to do this, and is very troublesome. I
accidentally dropped something on the keyboard one day, and sat there
helplessly for _*five minutes*_ as Pine tried to scroll down past the last
message in my folder!  The next time that happened, I just killed that
Pine session and started over.  AFAIK, this was not present in 3.95...  Is
this a bug or a new feature?

Does this also have to do with the fact that Pine is now incredibly slow
when checking message?  What I mean is, in 3.95 (again :), if I was in a
folder of 1,000 messages, I could just hold the down arrow, and it would
zoom through them, while I looked for out-of-place text.  But now, in
4.10, if I hold down the down arrow, it goes no faster than one message a
second--is this b/c it has to redraw the screen each time, and it didn't
used to (I thought I saw a post about this before)?  Or is there some sort
of "message-check-rate=n" feature I don't know about?  This is about the
only major change that I find non-optimal.

I mention these two as they seem related, and make checking large folders
a chore when they didn't use to be--not only can I not zip through a
folder of 1,000 messages, but now I have to wait for all the keystrokes to
clear up (if I held the down key down that is) before I can move to the
next folder!  A double whammy!

Anyway, thanks for all your help Scott.  Hope you have some ideas on this. 
Take care.

Scott, when I reply to your recent messages, this is all that gets picked
up by Pine, though there is obviously more to the message...  I checked
the message in Emacs, and could find no weird hidden characters, and a
cursory examination of the headers doesn't reveal anything strange...any
ideas? The other replies I sent to yours, I just pasted in the text (and
deleted the '>' since I didn't feel like adding them by hand :).

Ooops!  Ok, ignore the previous message--I should have paid more
attention!  When I noticed that everything after the "-- " was being
stripped, it hit me!:

"strip-from-sigdashes-on-reply" was enabled.  It's just that I'd never
seen it working before, and never used it, so it confused me for a
minute...  In any case, as you can see I obviously figured it out, so
ignore my inane babbling. *grin*

But my other babbling about queued keystrokes and slowness checking
messages still is valid...so don't ignore those! :)

Scott, when I reply to your recent messages, this is all that gets picked
up by Pine, though there is obviously more to the message...  I checked
the message in Emacs, and could find no weird hidden characters, and a
cursory examination of the headers doesn't reveal anything strange...any
ideas? The other replies I sent to yours, I just pasted in the text (and
deleted the '>' since I didn't feel like adding them by hand :).

	This is neithe a bug, nor a new feature.  This is NOT a Pine
feature, this is an opperating system feature.  It is possible that with
the upgrade to 4.10 other changes happened on your system.  I do doubt
that it is as major as you sugest (that it didn't used to buffer the
standard IO, and now it does), but what do I know...

	This, is also a change that is almost certianly not WITHIN Pine,
but certianly could be part of the system.  I did play with using IMAP in
3.96, and it WAS incredibly slow (as you describe it), so I suspect this
is something to do with something like that...

	I suspect that they are related, problem 1) you notice because of
problem 2).  Problem 2) probably has been created because of a change on
how your servers are working, which also may have something to do with
problem 1 also...

Hi Jessica, 

Thanks for the response.  Comments in-line.

I figured that it might be an OS thing too, though a cursory inquiry at
the time of the upgrade didn't reveal any new OS changes.  But when you
say "I do doubt it is as major as you suggest"--thrust me--it IS!  I
understand what you're saying about buffering standard IO, but it's as if
there is also a set delay introduced between the exceution of each
keystroke--it is INCREDIBLY annoying!

On another system that is still running 3.95, I can go into a folder with
lots of messages, view one, and hold the 'N' key to scroll through the
messages at lightning speed--and as soon as I hit 'I' I'm instantly in the
Index.  But on the system running 4.10, if I try that, I wait about 1
second between the next message redraws, and that's crazy!  Not only that,
but if I hold down that 'N' key, then if I decide I want to go to the
Index, I have to wait for all the queued keystrokes to go through, and you
can imagine how annoying that is--it's also pretty detrimental to
efficient mail reading, which I need for work...

Hmmm, ok that would make sense if we switched from POP to IMAP or
something, but I could have sworn that we were using IMAP already...I'm
checking with our postmasters on this (they're no good at noticing
problems as they all use MM anyway) :P

Well, if you or anyone else has any ideas (Scott? :), that would be great!
I'll let you know if I find out anything from postmaster here...  Thank
you very much.

Don't feel bad on this one.  Last week a faculty member was pasting a
short document from WP8 to Pine with two sets of -- in the main text, and
his signature happens to be 8 lines long.  Half showed up after the first
--, and half after the second --.  I'd never seen it before and couldn't
stop laughing after staring at it for a minute.  I'm a newbie when it
comes to sigdashes, so I'd only heard about it until then.

Subject: Bug in unix.c(unix_open) (getting lock from other process)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi!

I noticed a bug in imap/src/osdep/unix/unix.c (unix_open):
While trying to lock a mailbox, lockname is called first, which also tries
to open and lock the file that contains the PID of the other process.
If it failes, this fuction closes the pid-file and returns -1, which is
assigned to fd in line 393 of unix.c.

But if lockname failes and it's the first try to obtain the lock, the
file descriptor of the already closed file is used to read the process id
which, of course, fails.

I have I have added a patch for this below.

Cheers,
         Leo

Hello,

Have anyone ever configure a UNIX pine to receive the POP3 email from the NT
Exchange server?  UNIX machine does not have any mail system working.
Exchange server on NT, which is on the different IP address, is the only
e-mail system running.

Thanks in advance for the assistance.

Exchange 5.5 supports IMAP4 which Pine prefers to use.  Some folks claim
they have gotten pine to talk to MS Exchange Server but noone has 
provided details on how to do it.

When I try to connect to an MS Exchange Server, I get a message, "Clear
channel (I assume non-encrypted) passwords are not allowed."  I suspect I
need keberose 5 server on my machine.  I don't have root privileges so
that won't do me any good.  Appearently Pine can be compiled to have
Keberose support.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Steven

The puzzling part is that I can configure it to send out the mail from the
exchange server.  Hmm...  Perhaps that I can configure the UNIX's e-mail and
have Exchange relay the message to UNIX?

Hello,

I have gotten PINE 4.00 (haven't tried newer versions, yet) to talk with an
Exchange 5.5 server via IMAP4.  PINE is running on a Digital Unix 4.0d
server.  I am currently in the process of setting up a Sun Solaris server
with PINE 4.10 which will also use Exchange as the mail server.  (Anyone
here good at configuring Solaris for caching-only DNS resolution??)

Please contact me for further details.

-Jody

BTW: For the morbidly curious, I initially got PINE 3.96 running under
OpenVMS to talk (via IMAP) with Exchange.  This did require some
'non-standard' modifications to PINE in order to accommodate Exchange's lack
of some of the older IMAP2 commands.

I'm using Pine 4.10 on SunOS 2.6.

When I change folders using ^G (goto), I sometimes make a mistake that can
be very annoying.  After hitting ^G, I have to hit ^N the right number of
times, then enter the name of the folder I want to go to.  The ^N cycles
through the folder collections as below:

GOTO folder in <Incoming-Folders>  [INBOX] : 
GOTO folder in <Mail>  [sscp] :  
GOTO news group in <News on news.missour> : 

A minute ago I accidentally hit ^N one two many times and tried to go to
folder 'sscp', but I entered it as a newsgroup.  It doesn't exist as a
newsgroup, so the system just sat there waiting for something to happen. I
don't know how long it would take and I didn't want to find out, so I hit
^C a few times and ^Z a few times, but those keystrokes had absolutely no
effect.

Finally, I opened another telnet window and killed pine.  There didn't
seem to be another way to get back to work immediately.

It would be very nice if pine would process ^C input while it is trying to
access newsgroups.  That way we could tell it to give up before too much
time passes.

Thanks again for making pine!

Mike

This is a highly replicable feature because I just did it three times and
it happened every time.  It can be pretty devastating.  I'm running SunOS
2.6 and Pine 4.10.

I was in a '<Mail>' folder called sscp.  I used 'L' to see my Collection
List, I selected 'Mail', and that left me in the list of Mail folders with
the cursor on 'sscp' (one of my folders).  Then I hit 'G' for GoTo,
entered the name of another folder in the Mail collection, and hit enter.

You'd think it would just go to the next folder, but instead I get the
following message:

Save the 1075 read messages in "sscp"?                                                
Y [Yes]                                                                               
N [No]

The problem with that message is that there definitely were no deleted
messages in the folder!  In fact, there are 1132 messages in the folder
and I have no idea how it picked the 1075.

The worst of it is that you *must* either 'save' the messages in their own
folder, or you must not save them (which means what?  I don't know).
There is no other choice.  So now I just go to another window and kill
pine.  The first time it happened to me, I said 'Yes' and it spent several
minutes generating second copies of the messages in sscp and putting D
flags on the first copies of the messages.

Is this happening to other people?  It might have something to do with the
existence of an Incoming Folder with the nickname sscp, but that folder is
not being used at the time, so I can't see how it should have an effect.

Regards,

Mike

I'm "close" at Solaris 2.5.1 and Pine 4.05...  :-)

Doesn't happen here....

Eduardo was right about this.  Changing the name of the Mail folder to be
different from the nickname of the Incoming folder does prevent the error
from occuring.

I also discovered the following:  The error occurs when I try to use GOTO
and I am looking at the list of Mail folders.  It does not occur if I use
GOTO while I am looking at the Index of a folder.  Thus, I believe the
programmers recognized this problem and fixed it partially, but didn't
catch an instance where it still occurs.

Review:  Pine 4.10 (SunOS 5.6) sometimes mistakenly treats Mail folders as
if they were Incoming folders, but only under certain (replicable)
conditions, and this can cause damage to mail folders.  My folder was
damaged (messages were copied into a different order) but I was able to
fix it.

Regards,

Mike

	I have a feeling that this is not a bug, but an unintelegent
implementatio of a feature.  That is, uninteligent in that it doesn't
realise that it is saving to the same folder.  I recall something
somewhere (I don't know where, and I can't find it right now), that there
was a way to save read messages to a folder on exit of the folder they are
in (that may be the 1075?).  I can't locate it right now though...

Ya, the incoming-archive-folder feature (which incidentally, I can't get
to work--even though I've defined the archive folders and set them up and
everything...but anyway.. :).  

The idea is just like you said--you have incoming folders, and upon
reading the messages and exiting the folder, it'll ask you if you want to
save those messages to the archive folder...there are a couple of options
you can set wrt this feature, but I forget exactly (since I haven't been
able to get it to work :P ).  I'm sure someone else can provide more
details, or you can check the help for "archive".

I hope the Pine development team is not being distracted by these comments
about "features".  The problem could be called "an unintelligent
implementation of a feature," but it is really a simple bug that needs to
be fixed.  The problem only arises under a very particular set of
circumstances (as delineated in my last message).

I appreciate the comments of the other writers, but they should look
closely at my last message and see if I'm not describing a bug.  My
previous message is appended.

Mike

Eduardo was right about this.  Changing the name of the Mail folder to be
different from the nickname of the Incoming folder does prevent the error
from occuring.

I also discovered the following:  The error occurs when I try to use GOTO
and I am looking at the list of Mail folders.  It does not occur if I use
GOTO while I am looking at the Index of a folder.  Thus, I believe the
programmers recognized this problem and fixed it partially, but didn't
catch an instance where it still occurs.

Review:  Pine 4.10 (SunOS 5.6) sometimes mistakenly treats Mail folders as
if they were Incoming folders, but only under certain (replicable)
conditions, and this can cause damage to mail folders.  My folder was
damaged (messages were copied into a different order) but I was able to
fix it.

Regards,

Mike

Here's a strange little quirk of Pine that seems to have been present at
least since 3.95.  Maybe there's already a box I can check to fix this,
but I don't know where it is.

If someone sends me a message with, for example, this:

From: c723356@showme.missouri.edu

in the header and I reply to it, it will keep the same address and put it
in the To: field.  Good.  But if I move my cursor to the To: field, and
the individual is in my address book, it alters the To: field accordingly:

To: Tim Morgan <c723356@showme.missouri.edu>

I *like* that and I want it to stay as it is when I fcc the message.  This
is the problem:  when the message is saved, the full name "Tim Morgan" in
this case, is deleted and only the address is saved in the header of the
fcc'd message.  (As shown below.)

Can't I make it keep the full name in the header?  Do I really have to
delete it and re-enter it?

Thanks,

Mike

Mike,
  Thanks for letting us know about this. It will be fixed in the next Pine
release. To work around the problem you don't quite have to delete it and
re-enter it, you just have to do something to the line. You could add and
delete a character (leaving it the same as before you added and deleted).

Dear LIST:
I am using Pine 4.10 on Linux 2.0.30. I have a ".signature" file with the
following contents:

   M. Tajamolian
   _longdate_

But I find out that Pine substitutes the _longdate_ phrase only when I
replying a mail, no for from scratch composed mails. What is the source of
this problem? Can anyone help me?

Dear LIST:
I am using Pine 4.10 on Linux 2.0.30 and my INBOX is defined as follows in
the ".pinerc" file:

inbox-path={peik:143/user=majid}INBOX

Peik is our IMAP server and I had not any problems with it till our
administrator upgraded the Peik machine to Linux version 2.0.34 (RedHat
5.1). Since that upgrade, I receive the following error message from Pine
while trying open my INBOX at the Peik machine:

 Mailbox vulnerable - error

What is meaning of "Mailbox vulnerable"? What is source of this problem?
Any Help?!

Dear Joe:
THX a lot for your guide. OK, it had 660 permissions and the problem was
overcomed when I changed it to 600. But a question: Is it a true behavior?
Why PINE is sesitive to the group permissions while the group id of
mailbox files is "mail" which is a system related and predefined group. I
tested them and saw that only owner of mailbox had access to it at the
following case:

-rw-rw----   1 majid    mail            0 May 10 12:02 majid

Is it a bug in PINE or ...?!

     Is there a way to stop pine complaining about IMAP directory=20
     permissions?  I don't want to change the permissions (since they are=20
     correct from the sys end and several programs use those directories)=20
     but I don't want my IMAP users being misled by pc-pine into thinking=20
     there's a security problem=2E

	I thought that the correct permissions for the directory were
1777, someone just said that 600 is correct.  Am I confused, or are we
talking about diffrent things?  Would changing the permissions to satisfy
Pine cause any problems with anything else on the system thinking that the
permissions were not right?

When I type U in the message index or while viewing a message, I get
this status message:

  [Deletion mark removed, message won't be deleted]

whether there's a deletion mark or not. This just happened to me while
I was viewing a message and it was disconcerting because it was a
message that I would have been upset about if it had been marked for
deletion. I went out to the index to see if I had accidentally marked
some other messages for deletion too. So, my request is that if
someone types U and a message is not marked for deletion, Pine
produces a status message like this:

 [Message not marked for deletion; no action taken]

Thanks,
Nancy

You are running Pine3.95.  Nancy is running Pine4.10.

Yes, bring back the 3.95 behaviour.

OK.  I apologize for the delay in reply, but I wanted to finish configuring
my SUN system first.

In order to access an MS Exchange server using PINE you must have version
4.xx.  I did modify 3.96 (on VMS) to work, but it was less than ideal, and
did not provide support for using the Exchange directory.

Within the .pinerc file for version 4.xx, I modified the following entries:

	inbox-path={imap.lovelace.com/user=xxxx}
	rsh-open-timeout=0  <-you may need to add this
	folder-collections=Exchange {imap.lovelace.com/user=xxxx}[]

If you have added support for LDAP, the following entry also needs to be
changed

	ldap-servers=ldap.lovelace.com
"/base=/impl=1/rhs=0/ref=0/type=name-or-email/srch=contains/time=/size=/cust
=/nick="

Of course, you would need to make the appropriate adjustments based on your
server name(s), but I believe these were the only settings required for
connection to the Exchange server.  Remember, YMMV.  Also, you must be
certain that the Directory Name (from the Advance Tab of Mailbox properties
within Exchange Administrator) matches the NT Username, or you will not be
able to connect.  (At least, this is my experience.)

PINE and Exchange are by no means an ideal pairing.  As a matter of fact, I
am still fighting a very interesting problem where certain messages are
truncated within PINE while reading.  (The message is OK if viewed with MS
Outlook.)  I have been unable to find any particular correlation between
where messages get truncated (not all do) and something specific embedded in
that part of the message.  Any ideas from the PINE developers on this one??

Good luck, and let me know if you are still having trouble.  There are other
settings I change in my .pinerc, but I don't think they are specific to
Exchange.

-Jody

BTW: Is there any way to have the /user=xxxx username filled in from the
Unix login name or a shell variable?  I would like to create a generic
pine.conf-fixed with this info if it can be done.

If the xxxx in /user=xxxx matches your login name, the /user=xxxx flag
isn't even necessary, is it?  By default, Pine fills in the name you used
to log on to the machine Pine's running from, at least on the machines
I've run it on.

I often get e-mail with attachments that look like:

  [Part 1, Text/HTML  159 lines]
  [Cannot display this part. Press "V" then "S" to save in a file]

and I have to save it, quit pine and then get into lynx and open the
file. Isn't there a way to specify a html viewer in the settings or
something, kind of like when you specify the editor?
Thank you.

Thanks for getting back with us.  But, I've had those lines in my .pinerc
months ago.  The problem is that it seems that the Exchange server I'm
trying to access has username/password encryption turned on.   I get the
following message when connecting:

         [>Clear text passwords have been disabled for this protocol<]

So I think I need to compile Pine with Keberose 5 support.  But, I don't
think Solaris 2.6 comes with Keberose 5 on it I think it has krb4 or
less.. I don't have root access to my system and there is no way I can
talk to this site's Exchange admins much less get them to make any changes
to the Exchange server.

I realize security can be a touchy subject.  I'm not trying to bypass any
security.  Just trying to figure out how to get pine to do the proper
encryption.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Steven

Duhhh!!  I guess I should have tried it this way first.  The copy of 3.96
that I modified for use with Exchange would continuously prompt for the
username/password whenever moving between folders if the username wasn't
included in the server specification.  Of course this could have been
related to my modifications. :)

Nevermiinnndd!!

Yeah, I guess that could be a problem.  Due to the way our network is setup,
we weren't overly concerned with having clear-text passwords on the wire
internally.

I don't know if Kerberos will help any either.  I know that Exchange 5.5
supports 3 types of authentication out of the box.  Clear-text, NT
Challenge-Response (probably what your site is using), and MCIS Membership.
Each of these can be enabled with and/or without SSL.

Unfortunately, I don't really have the time right now to try other
combinations of authentication to see what can/cannot work with PINE.
Perhaps a third party has written a Kerberos mechanism for Exchange?  If I
get the chance in the next couple of days, I will check on this.

Ah, I'm not the only one who noticed this... slightly disconcerting and
not a show stopper but it would be nice if it reported the right status.

This has happened to me before, the problem is not with pine, but it is
how you are connected to it. In my particular case, my telnet program
"missed" one or two "escape codes" to display the right character on the
right line, and all the screen looks and acts different. If it happens
again, type CTRL-L this refreshes the screen and clears up garbled text.

We've seen this happen on occasion in our labs when the terminal 
emulation program is set to an incorrect number of lines.  It's been a 
while, but I think this happens when the program is set to fewer than 24 
lines per display screen.  It can be very confusing for the user and for 
the support staff.

I understand about terminal types and regular Pine, but what about
PC-Pine 4.10?

MIME-Version: 1.0

Greetings:

We have been using Pine for several months now and greatly appreciate this
fine program.  We are using ver. 3.96 on IBM AIX 3.2.5.

Beginning this morning, starting Pine has been very slow.  I checked
system load, and even with high idle time, the startup has been slow.  The
priority of the Pine process itself is normal:

       F S  UID    PID   PPID   C PRI NI ADDR    SZ    WCHAN    TTY  TIME CMD
  240001 S 1999  87753 106029   1  60 20 2b97   372 b58a7c90  pts/7  0:00 pine
  241801 S 1999 106029  49196   0  60 20  604   176           pts/7  0:00 ksh

During business hours we have from 30 to 50 users on the system.  Today when
I noticed the slowdown, there were four or five users in Pine.

Once Pine has started, everything seems to function normally.

Nothing has changed in our pine.conf file from yesterday to today. 

I checked the FAQ on the website, and did not see an answer to this.

Any help would be appreciated.

Regards,
Glenn

Dear Pine Gods,

Please do not use exclamation marks unless something is truly
extraordinary or important. For example, in this status msg:

  [New mail to you! From Yogi Bear subject: BooBoo]

I don't think this^ exclamation mark is needed! 

Thanks,
Nancy

I don't know about that....  An email from Yogi seems rather important to me.

You are talking about the "!" at the end of your sentence, yes?

Yeah.

> Could she have ended with a small joke, perhaps?

Perhaps.  I know I forgot my ;-).

Yet, this "!" thingy is a nit picking cosmetic item.

Funny thing, as I was typing this in I got a notification about "New
mail!" from Postmaster to inform me of a non-deliverable.  Being the
Postmaster of this site it was, to me, important enough to add the "!".  
I suppose this could lead to a whole new set of configuration settings.
You could specify when to set the "!" and when not to based on the sender
and the To: and/or Cc: fields.  Hummm....let's see, if I get a mail from
my boss but I'm not in the To: or Cc: header then he must have Bcc:'d
me....that may make it worthy of a "!".  :-)

Good night....

Ed

P.S.  Sorry....too much coffee today.

An Update:

Thanks to Florence Lee for her responses to me.

I noticed after I had originally submitted my message that telnet was also
slow to respond (which I attributed to a routing issue), but did not think
the two issues were directly related.

But...

About 17:30 CDT, Pine -AND- telnet began to function normally.  I am the
only user using IMAP; all users were experiencing the slow start of Pine.
Neither Pine nor telnet were "running away", they were just slow to wake
up.

Everything is working fine today.

Interesting...

How aout checking the "urgent" flag?  If set, use "!".  If not set use
".".  Otherwise, use "?".  [You got new mail?] :) 

Later,

The token _longdate_ refers to the date of the message you are replying
to, not the current date. You probably want to use _curdate_ instead.

I am testing getting to my usenet news server via Pine4.10.

Pine finds my active file for subscription purposes.  But, it cannot
acccess the spool directory and files created by DNEWS.  It will let me
post a message to those news groups that I am subscribed to.

Any suggestions as to where I might start debugging.

TIA.

It would appear that you are already "out of the loop".  If you were to
actually read the mail coming from the pine mailing list you'd have seen
this:

at the bottom of each post.  Then you'd visit the web site and find out
how to unsubscribe.

Hi,

I'm using Pine 4.10, accessed thru' telnet.

Sorry if this has been asked before, I want to bounce a mail 2 times to
the same person. But when I create a list with 2 times his address and use
that to bounce, it sends only once. Is there any way that I can do this,
may be through a script?

Since I have to do this on a regular basis, it would be nice to have
some mechanism that does this for me without too much of effort.

Any help would be higly appriciated.         

Ganesh

	This would not be a ``usefull'' Pine function.  May I ask why you
would want to send the same mail to someone twice?  I can think of reasons
for doing this (have done it myself), but I'm not so sure that it really
is a good idea, unless it is expected by the poster.

	1) it is fairly easy to do a bounce, and do it twice.  Certianly a
duplication, but well, why would you want to do it in the first place?
	2) it is possible you can do it through a shell script of some
sort.  But, your SMTP server may have a problem unless it is two seperate
messages which it sees as two seperate messages.

I don't know, but have you tried changing the case of some of the
characters in one of the addresses to see if that fools your system into
believing they are two distinct addresses?

Sorry, I just tried it and it didn't work.  Pine is too smart about
addresses.

I'm looking for information on Pine's pipe command.  (I'm using
pine-4.10 on a SunOS-5.7 platform.)

Pine's pipe doesn't work like the ELM code base from which Pine was
supposedly built.  I have a moderately complex Bourne shell script I
have used to read a pipe from ELM.  This script prompts me for some
information, incorporates that info and the piped-in email message into
a form, and then invokes a screen editor on that form.  After I exit
the editor, ELM resumes, allowing me to send the form.  The point of
all this is to easily incorporate email messages sent to my personal
account, into a work request system which has formatting requirements.

With Pine, however, piping a message to the shell script fragment
below behaves miserably.  Pine behaves as though it won't hand STDIN
to my script and/or is operating in cooked rather than raw mode.
It doesn't give me the opportunity to enter a line of input before
going merrily on its way.

Does anyone know if there is a config/setup option that modifies
this behavior?  (I looked in the tech-notes.txt file but found no info
describing what the user can expect of Pine's pipe command.)


#!/bin/sh
 echo "enter data:\c"
 read data
 echo "data=$data"

Wes,
  Thanks. This will be fixed in the next release of Pine. Meanwhile, you
may be able to work around the problem by wrapping your filter in a script
which knows how to duplicate the tmpfile argument.

When running pine [V4.10] on my RH5.2 box and trying to expunge the deleted
messages, I get a long delay and then the error message;

 [Checkpoint file failure: File exists]

Same goes for when I exit Pine.

If I exit and re-enter, the deleted files are not removed (Which they used
to be)

Can anyone shed any light on what file is stopping this, or could it be a
hard disk error?   my /var resides on a separate disk..

Thanks
Darryl

	What about in the username?  That is technicaly case preserving,
and possibly case sensitive.  Pine should not have a problem thinking they
are diffrent.  Or, placing a + at the end of the user name.  Both of those
will make for an address that can not be ``assumed'' to be the same, but
probably will deliver to the person without any problem.

Depends; if the deleted items were expunged (the X command) then they're
like Clementine - lost and gone forever...

	Um, actually Pine has a bug then.  Maybe it isn't Pine that is
outsmating you though.  Maybe the problem is on the other end, in which
case you need two seperate messages.  I believe that some servers are
setup to reject duplicate messages, which would be what it is seeing if
you are sending a single message with two addresses in it.

	That's a feature that I'd like to see, that re-formating of
multiple levels of quotes is smarter.  I don't know how difficult it would
be to implement, it's not a BIG deal, just something I'd like to see, I
can always go into joe and reformat that way...

	Again, that depends...  If it is on the backup, you can restore it
from there, but other than that, if it was expunged, it is gone...  And
probably entirely irrecoverably due to the way that I THINK things are
done.  I don't believe that ``if you are lucky you may be able to restore
it from the hard drive,'' is a safe statement to make (it's not safe
unless you REALLY know what you are doing, or are willing to do a big
``oops'' because you did something rather silly, (big oops meaning
possibly a complete restore of you system from scratch in the most extream
cases)).

Doesn't that depend on whether she's running Pine on a UNIX system or a
PC?  I had thought most people who posted here were running on UNIX, but
I've seen enough PC-Pine questions to know that that's not necessarily the
case...

The point being that in a PC one can always run Undelete or some Norton
utilities to recover "deleted" files.  Or does PC-Pine actually "wipe" the
HD when it expunges?  On a UNIX system, unless one has backups it is
indeed gone for good though...

	You can do a similar thing (or at least try) in *nix
envioronments, but I believe that Pine doesn't delete files, but updates
them.  So, unless Pine creates a scratch file of some sort, I don't
believe that you can undelete.  As, messages are not individual files,
folders are, and records (which you can view a message as), are not
recoverable with undelete, unless you can recover the entire file prior to
the expunge.

The MTAs (not pine) are smarting than you think.  You are seeking to have
the identical message show up in the same mailbox using emails addresses
which can be determined in at the same hop to be the same.

One way to get around this is to put the address in a format which would
split it at the very first hop.  This is easy to accomplish if you have 2
systems in your company resonsible for sending mails external to your
organization.

Send the mail like so:

userA%theirplace.com@somehost.myplace.com
userA%theirplace.com@otherhost.myplace.com

Ed

I am setting up Pine 3.95 on an HP9000 running HPUX10.2 and have a number of 
users who work in our warehouse that will receive inter company email but 
rarly check it.  I would like to set them up to
have their email print automatically.  I set up a distribution list in the 
global address book and then put them into the aliases file with a comment 
of their name within the quoted command to make them all unique (otherwise I 
just get one copy to print).  This works, I get all the copies to print 
however, the TO: in the email always says the group name not the individuals 
name, does anyone know a better way to do this?

Thanks for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Steve Conrad

Quite possibly, but I'm a Unix bigot, and proud of it.

Good evening, everyone.

I have been trying to get Pine 4.10 to work with DNEWS.  The error message
indicates that Pine 4.10 is unable to scan the spool directory.

Could someone send me a valid entry for .pinercc so I could check against
my setup?

Thanks in advance.

:) Dear Pine Gods,
:) 
:) Please do not use exclamation marks unless something is truly

:) 
:)   [New mail to you! From Yogi Bear subject: BooBoo]
:) 
:) I don't think this^ exclamation mark is needed! 
:) 

  Ok, after all the jokes, here's a way to do it.

  If you have access to the code you just have to erase the "!" in line
324 of newmail.c, if you don't use sed, say, and substitute the following
strings:

  "New mail%s!"

  by something of the same length

  "New mail%s.", say

  From the command line in my unix the command that does this is


sed 's/New mail%s\!/New mail%s./' pine > pine2

  An now use pine2, instead of pine. On the other hand, this won't solve
the problem, because there is another place where a "!" is placed in line
322 of the same code, so you would have to change also

  "%ld new messages!"

  by something of the same length as before.

  But on the other hand, I guess this message is important enough for you
to deserve a "!" in the status line message :)

Hi

I have just changed from using POP and fetchmail and pine to wanting to
use IMAP and pine.

I can connect to existing folders (or create existing folders) from the
browse folders screen by entering the machine name and user name as
follows:
{ubdcuenriv.usko.com/user=usko\chrisp\chris.picton}Mailbox

Is there any way to browse existing folders on the IMAP server, or do I
have to enter the exact name for each mailbox?

Regards
Chris

Good evening, everyone.

I have been trying to get Pine 4.10 to work with DNEWS.  The error message
indicates that Pine 4.10 is unable to scan the newsgroup spool directory.
Is that permissions?

Could someone send me a valid entry for .pinerc so I could check against
my setup?

Thanks in advance.

	I was trying to setup an IMAP connection for netscape 4.51 (I
think), but it just sat there and did nothing.  I realise this isn't
really a Pine question (and is technicialy probably off topic for this
list), but this really is the best place I can really ask this question at
this time.  Does anyone have any sugestions about what may be wrong?  Or
what I should be doing?  Looks like the IMAP server is not coming up, and
the connection is timing out...

First of all, have you checked that your mail server supports IMAP. You
might also try posing something to the comp.mail.imap newsgroup.

	As I run the server, I would think that maybe I could set it up.
I guess I didn't make it clear that I am running the server that I'm
trying to connect with netscape.  There is a bit of a problem with the
newsgroup, I don't recieve it, can't read it regularly, at least not right
now (not until I figure out a way to do that...).

I am running Pine 4.10 on an HP-UX 11.0 system, and I am having a problem
replying to one particular user when he sends me email with attachments.
He's using mail under Netscape 4.51, but so are other users, and I have no
problem replying to their emails that contain attachments.

When I read his email, I see everything just fine:

  To: "Neary, Annette" <xxxxx@cfsmo.honeywell.com>
  Cc: Mark T. Kramm <krambo@cfsmo.honeywell.com>,
       "Zola, Ken" <xxxxx@cfsmo.honeywell.com>

  Annette,

  Here are some thoughts after meeting with Ken and Mark about the
  Development group's support requirements.

I can see the text just fine, and I can view the attachment just fine.

Then I do a "reply", Pine pops me into my editor of choice (emacs) where I
see his original email, just like any other email.  I type up my response,
leave the editor, and back in Pine I see something like:

      [ Part 2, ""  Application/DOC  30KB. ]
      [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]

The "text" portion of my reply message gets glommed into one paragraph,
nuking the formatting of both the original part and my reply.  This is
repeatable for email with attachments from this user, and isn't limited to
"DOC" attachments.  But it works just fine for other users with similar
attachments.

Any clues as to what might be going on?

Thanks,

Unless you need to include the attachment in your reply (but in most
cases you probably don't -- actually I can think of *NO* case where
sending back the attachment is needed!).

Another Q related to your problem: Do you have emacs set up to
automatically justify the body of the message in some cases? If so,
try disabling that emacs macro.

Let us know if this helps,
Good luck,
Nancy

If there is a mailto URL in a message and I click on it, Pine opens up
the composer with the mailto address in the To line and uses my
default role. I would like to be asked which role I want to use,
assuming I'm using:

          [X]  confirm-role-even-for-default

Yes, indeed, that solves the problem for "reply", but the problem still
exists when I do a "forward" of the same message...

I agree that typically the attachment isn't needed in the "reply", but
there are times when I "reply" to a message and add new people to the
CC: list, and I want them to see the attachment.  Yes, I can use
"forward" for that scenario, but "reply" should work.  And, as mentioned
above, "forward" has the same problem...

Yes, emacs does do justification for me, but disabling it doesn't make
any difference...

The user and I worked on it some more this morning, and it turns out
that when he formats his message using the "plain text" option under
Netscape, all is fine on my end.  When he uses the "HTML" option, things
get screwed up upon hitting "send".  Another pine-info member suggested
that I "postpone" my reply and see if the mail in the postponed-msgs
folder was screwed up.  I did just that, and the postponed message was
NOT screwed up.  So it appears to be something in the actual "send"
process that is flaky.  Even my FCC: copy is screwed up.

If someone from the Pine development group wants to see the original
email for debug purposes, I can "bounce" them a copy.  Just let me
know...

Thanks for the suggestions and help!!

Sorry about that test message I just sent to the list. I was trying
to send a test message to myself and so I just typed R for reply to a
message I had sent. Pine Developers: *PLEASE* ask the user if she wants
to reply to the addresses on the From, To, or Cc lines. It is not
intuitive to have a reply go to the address in the To header.

Thank you,

In PC-Pine, you can right click and get a popup menu. It would be
great if every popup menu had the following in a fixed location (e.g.,
either at the top or bottom):

 Parent screen 
 Child screen

Or if you want to include shortcut keys, which would be even nicer:

 Parent screen    <
 Child screen     >

Thanks for considering this!
Nancy

[ I sent a detailed bug report some weeks ago, and haven't even had
  the courtesy of a reply, hence this post. ]

PINE 4.10, on Solaris 2.5.  Self-compiled.  Runs in X-Windows, or
more precisely, OpenWindows using X-Vision on a Windoze PeeCee.

My mail file is somewhat large (we're talking ~10Mb, and ~2000 items;
OK, so I must clean it up) and it can take say 30 seconds to check for
new mail, which is pretty aggravating.

When setting mail-check-interval to 0 to turn off mail checking, PINE
will eventually loop.  This is reproducible with another user.

Debugging shows it's stuck in the function display_message(), doing
a series of time()/alarm() calls, so it looks like it's trying to
write some sort of a message.  A brief look at the source indicates
that it may be confused by mail-check-interval being zero, but it's
hard to tell (I rarely have enough time to debug my own stuff!).

Has anyone else experienced this?  I've currently set the interval to
65536, as a workaround, which in turn leads me to...

Can PINE's obnoxious "feature" of checking for new messages at apparently
random times be turned off?  I know it checks at intervals, and on the
"n" command on the last message, but other actions also seem to trigger
it, which possibly explains the above problem.

Don't get me wrong - I love PINE, and will not use anything else - but
this little problems take the shine off a great product.

I run pine in much the same way that you do.  However, I don't allow my
INBOX to grow as large as you have.

If you frequently allow your INBOX to get this large you may wish to
consider switching to a different INBOX format.  The mbx format is
probably best for your situation.  If you pickup the imap distribution
there are 2 files in the docs directory which explain the different
formats available and their merits.

You should also consider upgrading to Solaris7 and then doing a recompile
on pine.  Having done so, the binary itself reduces in size from about
8Meg to 4Meg.

Regards,
Ed

I just noticed that a lot of messages that I post to newsgroups with
PC-Pine do not have a Lines header. I looked through all the messages
in comp.mail.pine that were posted with this in the header:

 Message-ID: <Pine

And all of them but mine contained a Lines header. The weird thing is
that some of mine *do* have a Lines header. Does anyone know why this
is happening? Is this a bug? Is the Lines header a required header?

Thanks,
Nancy
