The following mail was posted to the pine discussion list (and is copied
again; sorry folks) regarding a problem that arises when installing pine
from ports on FreeBSD (from port mail/pine4).

The responses from the discussion list can be categorised into two types:
1.  Running pine SGID (as suggested in my patch) is a *bad* idea --
    Mats Dufberg <dufberg@narnia.pp.se>;
2.  RedHat has no problem with the spool set to "0775 root:mail" --
    Mike A. Harris <mharris@redhat.com>

So, the question remains, but perhaps it is a pine/FreeBSD interaction
problem?

Basically: is pine's complaint on startup a red herring?  If not, what's
going on?  Can anyone lay claim to this issue?

(I've never yet had a response when mailing a port maintainer, but here's
hoping.)

Subject: Pine lockfile

I've just upgraded pine to 4.53 (on FreeBSD, using ports) and have been
reminded of a problem that required some investigation last time I
installed pine.  I don't really understand why this problem *still*
arises.

When installed, pine complains on startup thus:

	Folder vulnerable - directory /var/mail must have 1777 protection

This is telling me that my mail folder should be wide open.  I understand
that this is because pine wishes to place a lock file in this directory.
Leaving this folder wide open does not seem a good idea, and after some
investigation I came up with the following approach:

	# chmod +t /var/mail
	# chown :mail /usr/local/bin/pine
	# chown g+s /usr/local/bin/pine

The mail user only seems to own the mail folder, so it seems to make a lot
of sense to give pine exclusive write access to this folder.

Can anyone comment on:
1.  What's wrong with this approach;
2.  If there's nothing wrong with it, why isn't it done?

Has the Pine team come up with a way to deal with Spam?   I've been 
getting enough spam that I want to take action on.

I've looke at bogofilter and spamassassin but they seem to work under 
sendmail/procmail.

Any ideas how i can get these 2 to work directly with Pine without having 
to use external programs to process mail?

Thanks

Frankly, pine and other UA's (User Agents) should stick with being good
UA's.  I suppose you could use some of the filter functions of pine to
deal with it on a marginal basis....but if you really want to deal with
spam you'd use the tools written specifically for that purpose.  In that
regard spamassassin seems to have a very good reputation.

Ed

I've been doing a lot of research about this and the current darling
of spam fighting is POPFile. On my main Pine page, which is here

 <http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/>

I have a blurb in the "Pine-Related News" section at the top
about POPFile that includes links to "HOWTO: POPFile with Pine"
and a lot more.

If you don't want to try POPFile, another option is to create a
Pine filter that moves all messages that are From someone in your
address book to a "GreenBox" using a filter condition like this

 From or ReplyTo is in address book? =
            Set    Choose One
            ---  --------------------
            ( )  Don't care, always matches
            (*)  Yes, in any address book
            ( )  No, not in any address book
            ( )  Yes, in specific address books
            ( )  No, not in any of specific address books
                 Abook List = <No Value Set>


Everything else will be "possibly spam" and you'll have to go
through it and add all the non-spam addresses to your address
books so they'll get put in your GreenBox in the future.

Hope this helps,
Let us know what you decide to do,
Nancy

ImapAssassin works pretty well.  It reaches into your imap folders.

Fetchmail can be used in conjunction with imap folders to deal with moving spam.

Subject: Upgrading to Sendmail 8.12.8 breaks PINE (but not 'mail' or delivery)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hi guys.

I upgraded all my servers today to Sendmail 8.12.8 due to the security
fixes... however, at that point, PINE ceased to function properly. 'mail'
can still send, and mail is still received, delivered and sent just fine
(both from localhost and the outside network); however, PINE cannot
send...

I log in as jb@twu.net and try composing a mail to jb... when I hit send,
I get:

[Sending mail |     0%   |]

...and it just SITS THERE indefinitely, doing nothing...

At this point, the ONLY way I can resume control of PINE is by stopping
sendmail!!! At which point PINE immediately responds, and says:

"[Error sending: SMTP greeting failure: 421 SMTP connection went away!]"

Does anyone have any idea why PINE would just hang on sending? Please
help!

Upgrading to the latest PINE (4.53) did NOT help. Same problem.

Just tried IMAPAssassin.  Looked like it worked but I was getting an error 
when it tried to move the spam.   If my imap server doesn't allow folders, 
then what do I do?  Or can the spam be saved to a local mailbox?

An IMAP server that doesn't allow folders?  That odd.  I guess you're out of
luck.

This leads back to using SpamAssassin and fetchmail in combination. There are
possibly other alternatives but the configuration you're suggesting is so odd as
to make it nearly impossible to do it "the right way".  As for local folders,
sure, but the original question was about trying to /avoid/ using such things.

Actually I think Karl's original question was about avoiding
sendmail/procmail and finding a program that can "work directly
with Pine without having to use external programs to process
mail?"

Before we can recommend things -- and I do have some more ideas --
we need to know more about Karl's mail setup, e.g.:

* Are you using Unix-Pine, PC-Pine, VMS-Pine, or something else?

* Do you run Pine on your local machine or remotely in an ssh window?

* Is incoming mail delivered to your local system or to a remote system?

* Do you use Pine to access your *incoming* mail using IMAP, local
  system calls, or POP?

* Where do you store your mailboxes -- are they on your local
  system or on an IMAP server? or some combination?

* Do you receive mail at multiple "maildrops"? E.g., at work, at
  your ISP, at a free IMAP provider such as FastMail.FM, etc.?


Once we know more about the setup, we'll be able to help better.

Remote system.  If I could run sendmail or a variant, I wouldn't be asking 
this since I'd have gotten SpamAsssin (or other) to work with procmail on 
all mail.  But since I can't run anything on port 25 (Road Runner blocks 
port 25),  So I use IMAP to a remote system.

Thanks for your quick response Karl. Quick question:

Do you have shell access to the server where your mail is
delivered? If so, what are your thoughts about passing your
incoming messages through procmail *on the mail server*? My guess
is that you've rejected this option and I'd like to know why.

I will be off the Net for a while but will write more later. I'm
also curious to hear other people's suggestions.

Thanks,
Nancy

Would you be willing to read/store you mail on the local RH linux box?  If so,
then run either mailtutil (part of UW imap) or fetchmail to pull the mail off
the remote IMAP server (or POP for that matter) and process it locally.  You can
setup a cron job to run periodically to pull the mail.  Then your mail clients
can read them from the local IMAP server.  I do this.  I pull mail from about 6
different places and dump them all into local IMAP accounts.  I can then use
various mail client programs to access the mailboxes.  This also lets me run
ImapAssassin against those mailboxes, also driven by cron.

I also use hotwayd to pull the mail down from several hotmail accounts.
(fetchmail<-via pop3)->hotwayd<->hotmail)

If you want to leave the mail on the remote server you could, I suppose, pull it
down locally, fiddle with it and then put it back.

I generally find it's best to /move/ mail that's suspected of being spam instead
of deleting it.  I then periodically scan the folder for stuff that's over 30
days old and /then/ delete it.  Seeing as how many ISP mail accounts have size
limitations using a local IMAP server is really the only way to do this.

All this as opposed to try to make pine or any other MUA do the heavy lifting.
The mail programs generally do a good job of being just that, user mail agents.
Askingt them to get into spam handling has, so far, not been very pleasant to
use.

If it's an ISP account that uses IMAP but doesn't support folders it's pretty
likely it doesn't have shell access.

Pull them off the ISP server using fetchmail and push them onto the local
server.  At that point all the features of SpamAssassin, procmail and the like
become available.  The downsides are setup complexities and access.  The mail
being local means you'd have to get it from the local machine.  The ISP account,
conversely, might be accessible from anywhere.  The balancing act, of course,
being the size limits on the ISP mailbox.  If remote access is desired then open
up a secured sshd connection back to the home box and run pine inside it.

The benefit is the local box is a linux machine and can thus run many
server-oriented tasks.

And yes, it's mail delivery can still be pushed back through the ISP's servers,
horrible as that is.

Just a little more on my situation:

On my ISP, I have shell access.  Unfortunately, their mailserver is on 
another machine.  So this is why I rejected the idea about using procmail.

Bill K suggested running mail locally using mailutil/UW Imap/fetchmail.  I 
may be willing to do this--but I'm going to need to spend some time 
looking at this.

Hi Jessica,

Not that it helps, but I upgraded my servers (Solaris 8,9) to 8.12.8 and I
haven't experienced any issues (yet) with Pine 4.33/PC-Pine 4.33-4.53.  I
used the Sun patch instead of the Sendmail patch, but they should be based
on the same code.

When you send mail by mail etc you use sendmail directly, whereas with
pine you have obviously chosen to send through sendmail acting as SMTP
server.

Are you sure that you are using the same senmail binary for SMTP as for
direct sending?

Have you tried to send directly to sendmail from pine (which is the
default)?

Are you sure that you have stopped and restarted sendmail?

How are you receiving mail?

How would I check? No one ever tells me these things.

Yes, and (as noted earlier) it does not work... I can only send from pine
when I tell it to use the SMTP server "localhost" (as opposed to the
default, which is-- as you noted-- to use sendmail directly)

> Are you sure that you have stopped and restarted sendmail?

YES, AROUND FIFTEEN BILLION TIMES. Please... I am not a newbie, no matter
how "stupid" my question may sound.

Do you have more than one sendmail binary on the system? If so, remove the
execution bits on the one that you don't want to run, and test if the SMTP
comes up and if you still can send mail through mail.

When you send mail from mail, can you do as a non-privileged user or only
as root? Is sendmail SUID to root? What error do you get when trying to
send directly to sendmail from pine?

If you select "J" (journal) from pine's first "page" you can see more
logging.

Well, anyone could forget, couldn't one? Why not just say "yes" to my
question? I'm not out to embarrass you. :-)

Are the mail going directly to the SMTP server? Or are you using
fetchmail?

This is driving me INSANE.

I followed the security tutorial in "sendmail/SECURITY" (in the sendail
distribution) TO THE LETTER and now users cannot send mail at all!!!

When I try to send mail, I get: (in the syslog)

Mar  4 21:44:27 knife sendmail[22406]: NOQUEUE: SYSERR(jessica): can not
write to queue directory /var/spool/clientmqueue/ (RunAsGid=0,
required=9001): Permission denied

OK, so that's nice. The SECURITY file suggests that we do all this fancy
SETGID stuff on the binary, and chown and chmod /var/spool/clientmqueue
certain ways, which I did... but now users cannot send mail at all!

I am making NO headway on this problem besides finding the above error
messages (which should help some wiser soul help me fix my problem).
PLEASE, I beg of you, help.

Sendmail has been started by the non-priviledged user jessica. It is
SGID wheel, but it should probably be SGID smmsp (GID 25). What are the
permissions on /var/spool/clientmqueue?

It used to be in pine that you could type '*' and mark a message as
unread, for instance, so you wouldn't forget ot read it later.  Now that
command seems to have disapreared... is there a replacement?

thanks

The question of setting the spool directory protection to 1777 is a
FAQ.  I've quoted below the info from the Pine Information Center.
It indicates that the locking mechanism under discussion here is for
locking between the mail delivery agent and the mail user agent, not
between two mail user agents.  So, is the test above really
sufficient?

http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/sysadmins.html says:

11.5 Where does Pine create lockfiles, and what should that
directory's permissions be?

To protect against conflicts with mail delivery by sendmail, which
could cause INBOX corruption, Pine creates lockfiles in the directory
/var/spool/mail [1]. The permission setting for that directory should
be 1777 (world writable with the sticky bit set). The alternative
would be to make all mail programs setgid to some special group -- an
unacceptable security risk in the opinion of the Pine developers [2].

By contrast, lockfiles created in the /tmp directory serve
interlocking of different Pine sessions with each other, not of Pine
with the Mail Delivery Agent. Lockfiles in the /tmp directory are mode
666 because of the case of shared folders (e.g., tenex format) and
"kiss of death" functionality (UNIX mbox format and MMDF format). The
lock needs to be accessible by processes which may be logged in as
another user name; this is a tradeoff between security and
functionality.

[1] Versions of Pine prior to 3.92 did not warn users when locking in
/var/spool/mail failed.

[2] Some version of the Linux operating system are being distributed
with permissions that would require Pine to run setgid.

Probably not.

I have, however, done some other tests that I start to remember now. I
created a small perl script that did lock a file in the same manner as the
MDA does with fcntl(2). When I lock the spool file with the script neither
the MDA nor pine will access the file.

The script is written for FreeBSD. The locks are OS dependent, as far as I
remember.

I locking works, it should not be possible to deliver to the spool file if
the spool file is locked by the script. And pine should not do any changes
or even read the spool file.

OK..  Found out from my ISP that I *CAN* create folders.

but.. I can't see the folders in Pine.  (I can see them in mutt though) so 
what do I need to do?  Running Pine 4.44 on RedHat 7.3

Try turning on "enable-lame-list-mode" in M-S-C . I had to do that to see
'em from imap.panix.com .

	Of course your details will differ, but it will tell you what

Hi all,

I am trying to set up two RH8 systems.  Lets call the server jack and the
client jill.  I am trying to set up Pine 4.53 so I can read my mail from
either Jack or Jill.  BTW, I have read the tech-notes.txt file included
with Pine.

Jack has/is ...
  the /home directory
  the NIS server
  rshd enabled
  imapd installed from the Pine 4.53 distribution.
  the symbolic link /etc/rimapd has been created.
  xinetd.conf modified accordingly.

Jill has /home NFS mounted.  Jill is also running KDE 3.0.3.  I use Jill
to dual boot WinXP and RH8.  I installed RH8 on Jill about two weeks ago.

The ~/.pinerc has INBOX set to "{Jack}inbox".

I can log into either system under my account with no problem.  If I run
Pine while logged into Jack, it works great.  But, if I run Pine from
Jill, Pine fails to open the INBOX and gets the following debug error:

About to open folder "INBOX"    inbox: "INBOX"
IMAP 21:57:46 3/7 mm_log warning: rsh to IMAP server timed out
IMAP 21:57:46 3/7 mm_log babble: Trying IP address [192.168.151.204]
IMAP 21:57:46 3/7 mm_log error: Server disables LOGIN, no recognized SASL authenticator
IMAP 21:57:46 3/7 mm_notify bye: {gospel}INBOX (?) : localhost IMAP4rev1 server terminating connection

I have a .rhosts file.

jack  me
jill  me

I can run commands like 'rsh jack /usr/bin/fetchmail -q -d 300' from Jill
with no problems.  I have imapd on Jack set up to allow connections from
all hosts.  I used webmin to do the configuration.

Enough background?  Ask if you need more.  My question is, of course, how
do I get pine to open my inbox on Jack when I am logged into Jill?

Any info will be appreciated.

BTW, I *really* like pine for email and have gone to great pains to keep
the abilty to use it for the past 12 years.

Thanks,
Steven

Hi all,

Well, I fixed the problem.  First I enabled the saslauthd service on both
systems and created a imapd.pem file on Jack.  I was still having
problems.  Turns out here is a problem with using Jack's fully qualived
domain name when logged into Jill.  I don't know why, yet.  But if I go
into Jill's /etc/hosts and put just the name jack before the fully
qualifed name, then IMAP works great.

Later,
Steven

Okay, folks, a bizarre question for ya..

I have the relatively standard setup of using Pine on Unix to access an
IMAP mail server and send to an SMTP server.

Occasionally, the IMAP mail server is "acting up"... so when I sent a
message, it goes through to the SMTP server, but when it attempts to write
the message to my sent-mail folder via IMAP, it fails.

So, it dumps me back out to the message compose screen. Now, I could try
to send it again... usually it works on the 2nd or 3rd time, but each
time, I'd be sending the e-mail again, which is annoying to the
recipients.

What I usually end up doing is removing all the recipients, and it
eventually saves to sent-mail folder (or I postpone and come back to it
and do it later). But then I don't have any record of who I actually sent
it to..

So, after that long explanation, any way to save an outgoing message to my
IMAP sent-mail (with recipient info intact), *wihtout* actually sending it
along to the SMTP server?


Thanks,

Jeff

Guys,

I read this on my yahoo

If you have set the "Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server" field in Yahoo! Mail to
smtp.mail.yahoo.com, have set your client to use authenticated SMTP, and
find that you can receive but cannot send messages, you may have to use your
ISP server's address, rather than Yahoo!'s. Please contact your ISP for the
SMTP server address to enter.

How can I turn it on from pine.. or using my sendmail?


thx

.dave, knows nothing.

Ok.  I don't see the hazard in this particular application (since the mail
group has very little access to anything anyway), but I suppose as an
entity that's shared between every user it's a potential loophole?

When I upgraded my FreeBSD 4.7 to the latest patch and portupgraded pine
the problem returned.  So let me try a little experimentation:

First the starting condition (this is with my fix implemented):
	$ ls -ld /var/mail
	drwxrwxr-t  2 root  mail  512 Mar 10 07:42 /var/mail
	$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/pine
	-r-xr-sr-x  1 root  mail  4234672 Feb 17 08:11 /usr/local/bin/pine
	$ pine
Nothing unexpected is reported on startup.

Now to exercise the issue:
	# chmod g-s /usr/local/bin/pine
	$ pine
Pine reports:
   [Folder vulnerable - directory /var/mail must have 1777 protection]

This only seems to happen if there is incoming mail in my inbox.  So, this
is annoying, so I'll put the s bit back:
	# chmod g+s /usr/local/bin/pine

Basic information about my system:
	$ uname -a
	FreeBSD saturn.araneidae.co.uk 4.7-RELEASE-p7 FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE-p7 #3: Tue Mar  4 15:45:27 GMT 2003
	root@saturn.araneidae.co.uk:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  i386
	$ pine -v
	Pine 4.53 built Mon Feb 17 08:11:03 GMT 2003 on saturn.araneidae.co.uk


> I'm not sure there is an issue.

I don't really understand what's happening here, but it looks strange to
me.  Do you get this report, or is it peculiar to my installation?

Oh my goodness me.  I didn't realise there were quite so many patches.
Whoo!
    I'm not a pine developer, so I probably can't contribute much here...

Every once in a while, I get a message that comes through with a word that
appears to underlined by a squiggly line composed of "^" (caret)
charaters.  The sender(s) of the message and myself are also pine users,
all with the default character set (US-ASCII).  When viewing the raw data
file, the squiggly underline also shows there.  I've looked all over my
config, the help docs & the list archives, but have had no luck find where
the squiggly underline comes from.  Can anyone help maintain my sainity
and let me know where this comes from?

When I try to compose a new message when there's already a postponed message,
I'm seeing the following:
           [SECURITY PROBLEM: insecure server advertised AUTH=PLAIN]

I do NOT see this when I try to compose a message without a postponed
message existing.

This seems to have started recently.  Basically -- what does it mean/
should I tell the mail server people something/what should I say?

thanks

To clearify this a bit more, the senders of the messages are just as
baffled as I about the origin of the underline.  They are both extremely
competent software developers, so I doubt the problem is originating with
them.  They did NOT insert the underline manually on the next line of
text, nor can they think of any origin for it.  Sometimes it shows up on a
quoted reply, sometimes it doesn't...

Someone tell me I'm not crazy...

Does it show up like that in their sent-mail as well? Are you using pico as
the editor, or an alternative?

Can you reproduce, or is it random?

I am running Pine on a Linux workstation.  When I send mail, however, the
address that the recipient sees in the "From" line is not the correct
address.  Pine uses my linux account name in the address, so that the
line looks like the following:

Erik Johnson <linux_accountname@comcast.net>

Instead of my actual address, like so:

Erik Johnson <ej2980@comcast.net>

I have specified a reply-to address, but I would like the recipient to see
the correct address in the "From" line, to avoid any confusion.  I don't
see a way to do this through the Config menu, how can I do it?


Thanks,

Erik

There are two ways to do it:

 - Thwe fast and easy way: Press M S C and set

   customized-hdrs = From: "Your Name" <your@real.address.com>

   You are done! If you ever need to modify this value during composition,
   press ^R in the headers section of the message that you are composing,
   and you will be able to see the value and modify it.

 - or, you can use roles. Press M S R R to set up one. There's a explicit
   line where you can set the From: header.

The first method of changing the From header is the best way to do it when
you only need to change the current From header for another permanently.
If you need to switch the From header between different values in the same
session, consider using roles. You may also consider adding From: to the
list of default-composer-hdrs, in that way it will always be available to
be modified when you want to do so. If you do this, you will need to add
more headers to this variable, including To:, Cc:, Subject:, and others.

  I hope this helps you.

Certain mailers (OK, Microsoft) seem to generate Unicode punctuation
within otherwise ISO-8859-1 HTML documents, e.g. &#8217; instead of "'"
== &#44;
Pine 4.44 currently displays these as-is, though it decodes characters in 
the range 0-255.

Unfortunately, this seems to be legal. As far as I can see it is
considered correct to use an HTML character reference to encode a
character not within the current encoding. Why they just can't use the
ASCII subset of the ISO-8859-1 subset of ISO10646 for English I really
don't know (well, OK, there's no Euro symbol but I don't use that...)

It would be neat if Pine could map these punctuation marks into
ISO-8859-1 in the same was as Netscape 4 does; see below.


I'm upgrading to RedHat 8 shortly which has UTF-8 charsets by default so
no doubt I'll have to contend with fixing various old software that
needs C locale etc. etc.  :-(

I have attachmed a message her I received from the sympa mailing lists on
subscribing. It is crashing my version of pine.

I am running 4.53 with the all.patch from eduardo chappa on a Debian
(unstable system).

I am willing to think it could be my installation only, but as pine is
usualy nice and robust I thought I would post it here just incase it
affects others.

Cheers,

Stewart

Dear Stewart,

  I am willing to think it's not my bug, but it is very likely to be.
There was a crashing bug like that which only affected people using colors
with Pine (well, others were affected too, but it was very unlikely).

  I fixed that bug some time ago, and the latest all.patch has not crashed
on me, for quite some time. I would recommend you to upgrade and see if
the upgrade fixes the bug. If it does not, please let me know.

I have written a (probably ugly) patch for pine4.53 filter.c
which handles some of this. Things like quote marks, hyphens
& space are translated into iso-8859-1 single bytes and handled 
normally. Some complex characters (!?, ..., ''' ) are
handled using the "alternate" mechanism used for e.g.  -> AE
in ASCII

Hi,

I'm running several (pc-) pines at the same time to connect to several
mail accounts.  It is tough, however, to always remember which icon
represents which account---wouldn't it be nice to be able to set the
window title, so that the icon shows something else than "INBOX -
PC-Pine".

Can this be done?

Patrick

Hi,

Recently I experienced a small problem in Pine 4.53 running on
FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE.

When I open a mail message and return to the message index, all
fonts in Pine turn into a bold one. This includes the status bar,
the message index, the message itself, and the list of
Incoming-Folders in the folder collection. The font returns into
normal when I go from the message index to the folder collection
and back to the message index.

Anyone else experienced this problem?

Marco

Is it possible to run PC-Pine (under winxp) without having the window 
open?    ---  uh, that doesn't make a lot of sense. i want to use pine 
the way most people do, through a text shell (ssh, telnet, whatever) 
however the server is a winxp machine. how would i go about this?

and since i believe you are all quite worldly with these things and i 
never use windows... what is the best way to set up the ssh/telnet 
server necessary under winxp?

best regards,
			entropy

There are two or three products, I only know the
name of one - use putty on the windows box. When
you run putty it opens what you can think of as an
xterm running ssh.

That doesn't sound like what he's asking.  It sounds like he's asking if it's
possible to telnet to the XP box and run PC-Pine inside that session.  The
question is why?   The details presented don't explain what the xp server is
doing.  Is it running an IMAP server?  Or is it just a client workstation
running PC-pine to an IMAP server running somewhere else.

Ask better questions, get better answers?

you are right in your guess about exactly what it is i want Bill... 
i've got openssh running on the xp box now and want to open a pine 
session within that.

the xp box is just a workstation... less than that, it's a computer, in 
a house. i want to ssh into the xp box (no problem there) and open pine 
and read email and save it locally on that machine. and it's pop3 i'm 
accessing unfortunately, not imap...

Ah, that's what I thought.  You're stuck.

Near as I can tell PC-Pine doesn't run within the text console.  This sort of
makes sense as it really is a local application.  I suppose it /could/ be coded
to work in a cmd console but it doesn't do that now.

And to use POP on top of all this is asking for even more trouble.  Not that it
doesn't work but that you're pulling mail into a local filesystem that you can't
get to from an ssh session.  Really, it's quite a convoluted set of issues.

Save yourself further agony and put linux on an ancient P133 machine and run
IMAP on it.  You can configure that to use fetchmail, gotmail, hotwayd and other
interfaces to have it go pull the mail from the other locations.  I do this and
it's been working great.

That way you'd have real pine and ssh and could use putty on the other win32
machines to get to it.

oh, i know linux would save me a whole heap of trouble, but i didn't 
anticipate wanting to do this over a year ago when i had physical 
access to the computer.

i'm gonna give cygwin a whirl with pine and that should get what i want 
at least.

thanks for you comments

You can accomplish this if you run Cygwin in your machine and run the
Cygwin version of Pine. You can run a sshd daemon under cygwin and so you
can use any program to ssh to your machine. Cywgin is included with the
Cygwin version of Pine. However, Pine does not download messages from a
POP3 server to your machine, it must be configured to do so in a
cumbersome way (setting a filter to move messages to a local folder and
then open that folder). You will always be reading mail from the server,
and so the "ssh" part of the process can be eliminated.

Apparently Pine4.55 will be able to move your POP3 messages to a local
folder of your choice in a more natural way, so you may want to install
cygwin now and set up the sshd daemon until 4.55 comes out.

You can get cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/

It's been awhile since I had a windows box to play with, so I don't remember
the answer to this; does Cygwin have available (or can it be compiled)
fetchmail?  You could even run it daemonized and every N seconds it would poll
the POP3 server for mail, store it locally, and Pine could read that fine (I
used to do this in Linux at home, adding a ssh tunnel to the 'preconnect'
requirements for polling the pop3 server).

Yes, indeed. Fetchmail and Procmail are available for cygwin. The list of
packages listed in the setup program of cygwin can be found here:

http://cygwin.com/packages/

Not all packages can be found there. I use ispell, for example, which does
not appear in that list, but it can be found in this other list:

http://cygwin.com/ported.html

Yes, that's correct. I guess I had forgotten about that option too.

Thanks!

The original subject of the message was:

    Upon request

The infected message was intercepted and deleted by the 
UW E-Mail Virus scanner.

You are now reading a notice from UW Computing & Communications. The address in the From line of this notice was extracted from 
the message with the virus and may reflect the source of that 
message.  But it is quite likely to be an invalid address forged by the virus.

No action is required on your part.  However, if the From line 
and Subject indicate that this was a message you want to
receive, 
you may contact the sender and ask that it be resent - after the virus infection is cleaned up.	

This notice has been sent to all of the intended recipients 
of the original message to let you know that a message addressed to you was deleted.  The original sender of the message has not 
been notified because many viruses forge From addresses, and 
automatic responses can cause a flood of unproductive messages.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

I seem to remember this question was asked a while ago: is there some way
of seeing in the folder overview which folders have new messages?  As I
recall the answer was no, but it might be in a future version.

Has that future version arrived yet?

Hello,

I came across this message of about 2 months ago and I have an answer for
you.  You should wrap brackets around the variable such that it appears as
${user}.  This will fix your problem.  BTW, I didn't see it working any
differently in previous versions, was there a particular version that you
observed it to work differently?

Thanks,
Jeff

Hi,

I downloaded pine4.44 source code and compiled with "build". Pine is working
good. But I can't find Pine man page.
Anyone knows how to set up Pine man page?

# man pine
No manual entry for pine.

Thanks,
Hong

You need to copy the file pine4.44/doc/pine.1 to the directory containing
all pages for the manual. Take a look at "man man" in order to figure out
where to copy this file in your system.

I've done searching, though maybe not enough.   How do I Bcc a message I'm
replying to?   I know about ^R for a rich header during an original
composition, but that will read in a file during a reply.

Thanks.

If you're in the header portion of the message, ^R should get you the
expanded headers.  If you're in the text portion, it will ask for a file
to read in.
