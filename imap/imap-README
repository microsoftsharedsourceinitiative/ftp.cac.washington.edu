The imap.tar.Z on this directory points to the currently recommended
version of the UW IMAP toolkit, including the UW IMAP server.
Usually, this will either be a final or release candidate version; but
it may point to a development snapshot if it is felt that there is a
critical known bug in the most recent final version.

IMAP distribution names consist of "imap-", followed by the major
version (which corresponds to the year of release), a possible letter
which indicates a minor revision, and a distribution status, which is
one of the following:
 FINAL (or no status)	This is the final, permanently frozen
			 distribution of that verion.  Typically this
			 is associated with a release of Pine.
 RCn			This is a distribution that is a candidate to
			 become a FINAL.  Typically this is associated
			 with a pre-release of Pine.
 DEV.SNAP-yymmddhhmm	This is a snapshot of the current development
			 sources, with the date/time that the the
			 snapshot was taken.

Development snapshots are believed to be good versions, but they can
(and will) be updated frequently.

Old permanently-frozen versions of the IMAP toolkit are on the old/
subdirectory.  Note that all permanently-frozen versions have known
bugs.
