Subject: Pine and PC-Pine 3.87 now available

This version fixes several particularly unpleasant bugs found in Pine
versions 3.86 and earlier.  The bug fix list is fairly short, but should
make Pine quite a bit more stable and a little easier to use.  The list
includes the following reported bugs: 

 -crash in bezerk_open caused by out-of-context FCC (Leland Woodbury)
 -crash on Solaris with missing feature list (Keith Christopher)
 -crash with [No Message Text Available] message (Grant Weber)
 -crash on folder Rename (Dan Larsen)
 -crash with "Bad msgno in mail_fetchstructure" (Les Pennington)
 -need one more NL before included text if NO sig file (Jeannine Senechal)
 -makefile.sgi repairs (Mike Brudenell)

Thanks to all (including those not listed above!) who helped by reporting
and tracking down these bugs.  Apologies for any problems or inconvenience
they may have caused!

Subject: Pine 3.86 released

Version 3.86 of Pine and PC-Pine is now available.  The release also
includes new versions of Pico and IMAPd. 


STATUS...

This is primarily a maintenance release, although there are actually a
couple of new features (and therefore a chance of a few new bugs).  In a
few cases, we changed Pine's behavior back to the way it was before 3.85,
based on feedback from you. 

There are some important bug fixes, so we encourage everyone to upgrade to
3.86 as soon as possible.  You should update your IMAPd as well. Pine's
method of discovering remote folders has been changed (to avoid an
unfortunate conflict with other IMAP clients that make use of a hidden
.mailboxlist file) but will be somewhat slower *unless* using the new
IMAPd.  There are other IMAPd fixes as well. 

The list of changes/fixes is appended... and is quite long, considering 
that 3.85 is only two weeks old!


HOW TO GET IT...

--> Via anonymous FTP

  ftp pine.cac.washington.edu
  user: anonymous
  passwd: your email address
  binary
  cd mail
  get pine.tar.Z    <-- full distribution, including Pico and IMAPd
  get pcpine_f.zip  <-- version for FTP PC/TCP
  get pcpine_n.zip  <-- version for Novell LWP
  get pcpine_s.zip  <-- version for Sun PC/NFS
  get pcpine_p.zip  <-- version for Packet Driver
  quit

There will also be precompiled binaries available for certain
platforms.  These will have names like pine-bin.ultrix.

--> Via PC-Pine

PC-Pine users can also obtain new versions via the "Update" option under 
the Main Menu "Setup" command.  From the Folder Index of the Update 
Server, just select and View the msg containing the version you need, 
then View/Save the attached Zip file.

Note: it is still true that, because attachment encoding/decoding has not
*yet* been performance-tuned, using Update and Save will be slower than
FTP, but it may be more convenient.
