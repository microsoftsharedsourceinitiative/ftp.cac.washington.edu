Unless you are using Kerberos on your PC, you should download 
setup_pine_4.63.exe from the directory above this directory. This 
directory contains two versions of PC-Pine for use with Kerberos.
Most people will use setup_pine_4.63.exe instead.

What you'll find in this directory:

README              - This file.
setup_pine_4.64_w2k - Latest version (4.64) for PC-Pine for Windows 2000
		      (and XP Professional). Windows 2000 is distributed 
		      with Kerberos libraries and this version of PC-Pine
		      uses them.
setup_pine_4.64_k5  - PC-Pine configured for MIT Kerberos. This version runs
		      on Win9x, WinMe, NT4, Win2k, and WinXP and will also run
		      on NT3 and Win3.1x with Win32s. The third party software,
		      MIT Kerberos, must be installed on the server to take
		      advantage of the security enhancements in this
		      PC-Pine version.  More information about MIT Kerberos,
		      including its distribution, can be found at
		      <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/>.
