I just sent in a request to be added to the pine mailing list, which I'm
not on yet, but I was wondering if any sites had any user documentation on
using pine, like a short descriptive session (on paper) to get in and out
of it to send and receive mail, or anything else in addition to this.

Please cc to my address if you follow this up to the group. Thanks!

Has anyone configured pine for a convex? We have a C220 running
ConvexOS 10.0.3 which is sort of a bsdish thing with ansi c. I tried
using the BSD and the ult configurations and it looks pretty ugly in
error messages so far.

I get

I have 
user-domain=hep.net
in my pine.conf file, but it seems to be ignored when constructing
message IDs.

I have temporarily fixed the problem by re-ordering the entries
in the hosts yp database to be
...
131.225.40.41   nhmpw2.hep.net nhmpw2
...

but this breaks other things, like bootparams, which now seems to
demand entries have fully qualified domain names.

Any ideas?

We are just installing Pine and most of our users are novices and so
are having a problem with building and maintaining their address books.
Has anyone come up with a solution that allows someone to access a
global address book as well as a personal addressbook?

Part of the problem we have here is that we have people scattered
geographically around the country and as they come online, they're 
not aware of the other users that are on the system already.  We've
discussed putting together a shell script that would run around and
fix up everybody's addressbook as we put new people on the system, but
that seems like a pain.  The other idea is to send a message to everyon
telling them that a new set of users has been added, but then some won't
update their address book and we'll be right back where we started from.
Over time the problem will get worse as people come and go.

The documentation that I've read on Pine says that it doesn't support
a global address book, but there's got to be a way to keep people up
to date on who they can mail to.  

Any suggestions?

This is a terrific idea Mike, that I'd also like to see added/kludged into
pine.

I am running pine on Ultrix and something very strange happenned:

I don't know why but the Suid and Sgid bits of /usr/bin/mail and
/usr/ucb/mail disappeared and I could not receive any mail nor
send any.

I chmoded them back to 6755 and now I can receive mails and send
mails using /usr/ucb/mail but if I send a mail through pine,
pine says "mail sent" and I get the following message in
/usr/spool/mqueue/syslog and  the mail is lost:

Feb 10 09:30:36 localhost: 1300 sendmail: NOQUEUE: SYSERR: queuename: Cannot
create "qf~Z01300" in "/usr/spool/mqueue": No such file or directory

Of course, /usr/spool/mqueue exists ....

I think that there is a bad protection somewhere. I checked /usr/spool/mail
which is drwxrwxrwt.


Any idea?

I believe that option 1 would be of significant value to our

Thanks for your response Terry. I'm pleased to hear that this is indeed a
consideration for a future upgrade of pine. 

It is indeed desireable to have a global address book, that is simply an
extension of the personal address book, but would be maintained by the
local pine god. Ideally, your implementation would allow for
cross-checking to avoid unwanted duplication. 

Since pine has already set a high networking standard by its
implementation of imap, I would love to see this carried through in the
form of your suggestion to use 'whois/x.500/etc'.

It would be nice to see the first addition to a upcoming release of pine
in the 'short term', but the fully networked version would be an exciting
addition in the long-term.

Ian.

If the Convex has an ANSI C compiler, try the NeXT, AIX, or A32 configurations
and see if any of those get you any closer.

I sent my convex patches to the development team and they should be in
the next pine version.

My port is available on nic.funet.fi:/pub/unix/convex/pine3.05.tar.Z. 
It's configured to work like elm (folders are in ~/Mail/, several folder
name changes). To compile it use './build bsd'.

      5. If ^C Doesn't Work on a Mac

There's a problem with the default configuration of the Macintosh version
of NCSA telnet which prevents Control-Cs from reaching Pine.  Under the
"session menu", select "setup keys". There's you'll see an entry for ^C.
You should make sure it's blank. If it's not, ^C won't work in Pine.
This will fix it just for the current session. To make it permanent
you have to edit the configuration file. You should add a line:

        localkeys=[0,19,17]  (but use curly braces instead of [])

somewhere after the line that contains "name=default".  Also, on
VersaTerm Pro a similar problem occurs where ^C causes a break to be
sent on the modem or serial line.

We just noticed this happen with a DOS WordPerfect 5.1 document here
yesterday.  I looked into why it was happening and decided that
file_type() in pine/send.c was deciding it was quotable-text, when it
wasn't.  I'm not sure why, but for us encoding all enclosures as base64
works, so I replaced the call to file_type() with an assignment to the
value IsBinary.  This is a bad fix as it means some files that could have
been directly viewable with MIME tools now won't be, but we had a couple
of users who really needed to get going.

I did notice while reading send.c that there are special checks for
certain file types that just look for a signature of just a few characters at
the beginning of a file to determine file type.  This allows pine to
recognize some certain files (GIF and TIFF in particular), but it's
certainly possible for files to be recognized as being of a certain
type when they're really not of that type.

Ron et al,
This is a really important issue, and one we've been wrestling with for
some months.  (In fact, I've taken the liberty of CCing the MIME authors
in case they wish to comment.)

Putting aside for the moment the possibility that there may still be bugs
in either Pine's base64 or quoted-printable encoding/decoding routines, the
design problem is: when to use b64 encoding and when to use q-p encoding.

The issues:

  -Above all else, the integrity of MIME attachments must be preserved.
   That is, MIME is a failure if people can't have certainty that the
   MIME-attached bits will be delivered intact.  This would argue for
   using B64 encoding all the time.  (You don't want q-p newline
   translation to occur on something that wasn't really a text file.)

  -At odds with the above is the fact that text line delimiters differ from
   one system to the next, and if you know you are dealing with a text
   file, it would be nice if the system would handle newline translation
   automatically.  This argues for using q-p whenever you think you have
   a text file.  (If b64 was used for text, the destination system might
   have trouble reading the text, if the nl conventions were different.
   The translation couldn't be automated because the MIME typing doesn't 
   currently differentiate text files by originating OS.)

  -If you think you have a text file, q-p is also desirable because it
   is semi-readable by non-MIME mail readers.

  -One lesson of FTP is that we don't want a system where the user has
   to explicitly declare the type of file and therefore the encoding type.
   (That's not to preclude the possibility of override, but in general,
   we don't want people to have to say the equivalent of "binary" or "type
   image" in order to guarantee correct delivery.  I've seen too many
   help desk problems from getting this wrong; I've even heard the claim
   that you can't reliably send binary data on the Internet, presumably
   because of ftp mode ignorance!!)

  -The behavior (choice of encoding) should be predictable.  

So one problem is how to decide whether or not you really have a text file.
One can define a text file to be a file that only uses certain bit
patterns within the character space, but to be certain you must scan the
entire file.  But that's inefficient, so right now Pine looks at the first
chunk and tries to make the right decision.

It would appear that the current test is not sufficiently conservative,
and may also fail the predictability goal.  Some Unix systems have a very
sophisticated "file" program that could help, but others are less
sophisticated, and DOS users may have nothing of the kind.  So what is the
minimum acceptable test for "text-ness"?

Of if efficiency concerns imply that there will always be some uncertainty
in the correctness of the encoding decision --a bad thing-- should we
consider defining subtypes text/mac, text/dos, text/unix so b64 could be
used in all cases, and the mail *reader* could do the appropriate newline
translation, if any was needed?   (This assumes that everyone will soon
have MIME-capable mail readers available, which is arguable, but perhaps
not that unreasonable a premise if it would improve the certainty that
MIME attachments are reliable.)

Comments/suggestions are welcome.

Actually, a scrupulously correct MIME implementation shouldn't have this
trouble, because MIME says that text should be converted to CRLF form
before it goes into base64; however, I anticipate that many folks will
have trouble getting this detail right.

Yes, that's another good reason not to use base64 for text.

I think that's a bad idea; if you're going to put text in base64, you
should simply convert to CRLF conventions.  It's tricky to understand
the necessity of this, perhaps, but simple to implement.

Just my two cents....  -- Nathaniel

It's important to realize that there are two separate issues here:
 1) determining the difference between text and binary
 2) choosing between quoted-printable and base64

I will contend that the (2) choice is one of esthetics.  Quoted-printable is
quite capable of carrying arbitrary binary.  However, to make this choice
intelligently, you have to be able to do (1).

My NeXT MailManager application punts on both of these, and just transmits
everything as binary files.  This has the newline problem that Terry noted,
although it's not as serious as it might be since it's tagged as binary (there
is a MailManager bug in that it fails to do newline conversions when
unattaching segments declared as text).

The kludge suggested for Pine would make Pine do what MailManager does with
attaching (but not have the MailManager bug).  It certainly seems to be what's
needed to get your users back on the air.

The behavior you've reported with damaged attachments is *definitely* a bug,
and we'll look into it.  Either there is something wrong with c-client's
quoted-printable encoder, or Pine may be doing something wrong with preparing
the data for encoding.  Either way, we'll fix it.

First a couple of points:

 * If you follow the MIME canonical MIME encoding model as Nathaniel suggests
and first convert to CRLF and then B64 you have to make sure the body part
is tagged as text so the client knows to convert to the local end of line
convention. (This is related to other MIME discussions about what type to
use for an attached text file text/xxxx or application/o-s, or a newly
defined type). If you don't B64 encode it you let the mail transport
(sendmail in the case of UNIX) do the end of line conversion. This is what
Pine does now. 

 * Pine actually reads the whole file to make it's determination as to
whether it's text or not. If it has lines over some limit long or 
more than 10% characters with the 8th bit on it concludes the file is
binary. (It has to allow for ISO-8859-1 text which might have a few 8 bit
characters). 

I believe the bug in question here may be because the files have NULLs in
them and the above test for binary fails for the NULL character -- if it
has NULLs it should be binary. Then Pine tries to treat them as strings
and of course they wind up a lot shorter than they ought to. I believe this
is fixed in an unreleased version of Pine. 

I'm trying to remember exactly what the reliability problem of q-p
encoding is. I know one problem is going through an EBCDIC gateway, but I
can't think of any other. A file attachment that is text with some
non-EBCDIC characters will be corrupted as it goes through the gateway. 

It seems to me we have three choices now:

   1 Encoding everything in B64 including text attachments tag as text/plain
      + Increased reliability
      - Loss distinction between message text parts and text attachments
      - Loss of readability of text attachments by non MIME users 
     
   2 Encode text with q-p and tag as application/o-s (Current Pine)
      + Readability for non-MIME folks
      - Less reliable

   3 Create a text/file subtype for file attachments and B64 them
      + Increased reliability
      - Loss of readability for non-MIME folks

I've assumed that not handling the end of line conversion is not an option.
Three is the best if you don't worry about non-MIME folks. It is reliable
and distinguishes file attachments from text parts of the message, but it
will require an extension to MIME.

At this point I feel I'm sort of lacking data to decide which is best. 
What are the relative risks and importance of:
  
   - Is the reliability of B64 or q-p encoding really substantial? 
     What is the real risk here? How many EBCDIC gateways are there? 

   - How important readability for non-MIME folks?

   - How important is it to distinguish text parts from text attachments

We can eliminate the third trade off with a new MIME type, but we have to
choose between the other two. Personally in Pine I often will use a MIME
attachment for a text file while sending to someone without MIME because I
know they can read it, and then if they do have MIME we're encouraging
it's use. I'm also skeptical that there are that many reliability problems
with q-p encoding, though I'd certainly like to hear about them. How many
EBCDIC gateways are there, and what other problems are there? 

Lastly, it is often nice to display attachments when the user requests.
Right now if the type is application/o-s you have to use a hueristic like
Pine does when creating an attachment to determine if it is text or not to
know it it can be displayed. If the text/file subtype (or application/
text-file) where added then it would be clear which was which.

Hope this makes sense!

This is a comment just on the typing specification, not whether or not
to use b64 encoding...

As we've discussed separately, the problem with "text/file" is that it
breaks the typing model.  "file" is not a type, it is a specification of
the way the bits happen to be stored, and is useful only to distinguish
text that came from a file from text that was entered directly into the
composer. 

In order to make the text/file approach work, you would need to create a
parallel universe of "file" subtypes for all other *real* subtypes of type
text.  That is, you need to have text/plain and text/plainfile, text/rich
and text/richfile, etc.  (That's again because "file" has no bearing on
the semantic type of the information.)

So I think this is the wrong direction.  It is clear that the current
strategy in Pine of using application/o-s is also wrong, as it should
certainly be possible to display attached text files base on their MIME type.
So I believe attached text files should use the normal MIME text type.

This is orthogonal to the original question I posed of how to reliably
determine when you really have a text file, as it would be disastrous to
apply newline transformations to something that just *seemed* like it was
a text object...  obviously I didn't realize that Pine was already looking
at the entire file to make its decision, so maybe that's a non-issue.

Then the more interesting question becomes when to use b64 and when to
use q-p once you've decided you've got a text file.  Is it, as Mark
suggests, strictly an aesthetic decision, or are there cases (e.g. the
EBCDIC gateway) where q-p will lose data integrity.  (I'm assuming q-p
would be done in a way that quotes NL-From sequences that would otherwise
be munged by Bky mail delivery software.)

Since I'm personally convinced that data integrity is *infinitely* more
important than backwards compatibility for non-MIME mailers, this seems
to me to be the crucial issue.  (You can keep using Ctl-R text inclusion
until all your friends are MIME-capable!)

Hello Terry,

Since the two issues here are orthogonal let me reply twice. 

Yes, a bunch of subtypes like text/plaintext would clearly be a bad idea.
That's an interesting observation about the "text" major type. What
exactly does it mean? Seems that it can be taken to indicate that it is
text to be displayed as part of the initial message the user sees when we
opens the message, or does it indicate the format of the data? I'm not
sure if this is clear.

The main problem I see with tagging an attachment that happens to be text
as "text/plain" is that the receiver of will see little indication that
that part of the message is an attachment. This is the case in the way
that Pine works now and I believe is the case with Andrew. Instead the
potentially 100's of Kb will be text displayed when the user opens the
message as Pine (and Andrew I think) currently display all text parts of a
message right up front. We could change this so it only displays the first
text part, but there are many MIME messages (Barber shop MIME) for example
that wouldn't be displayed in this case. It was my impression that one of
the intents of MIME was to be able to map multimedia mail composed on a
GUI desk top into something that was manageable on a character terminal.

Would a subtype application/text-file, sort of a parallel to application/
octet-stream, solve this problem? There certainly aren't any other sub
types that we'd have to worry about. 

My personal use isn't certainly not important here. It would be nice to
hear what some of the other MIME folks think about the meaning of the
"text" type.

Or said differently, there is little indication that text entered directly
into the composer is *not* an attachment from the user's view point.  So
maybe we're looking at this backwards: the problem is distinguishing the
text that is entered directly into the composer so that it will be
displayed automatically, as opposed to displayed "on demand".

Is there some clever use of "text" and/or "message" types that could be used
to distinguish the composed text part of the message?

Yes, displayed on demand versus automatic is exactly the problem I have in
mind! Sorry if that wasn't clear.

I'm not sure that message type would fool Pine as it tries to display all
the sub messages and their text too. I don't see any subtypes under
message that look good though it seems like a clever idea. 

Another possiblity that's come to my mind is to use application/
X-text-file for now and as an experiment. Of course it would only work
with Pine, but it's legal MIME and other MIME implementations should just
treat it as application/octet-stream. (Better check the RFC on this one to
be sure). (Actually last I saw one MIME implementation was getting away
sending Application/octet-data which isn't even legal MIME).

Hi -

I'm staying out of the discussion about TEXT/FILE vs. APPLICATION/TEXT because
I think it's religious and I'm pretty ecumenical on that particular question.
I agree with most of the assessments of the pros and cons on each, and I'd go
with concensus.  Of course, that's easy for me to say since it's not up to me
to implement it!  ;-)

Please try to make sure Nathaniel and Ned have the details of this, because
supposedly q-p is immune to this.

I'm not sure this ``minus'' is all that important, as long as you have the
ability to save any text part to a file.  A clever user interface can do a lot
here, and Pine certainly qualifies.

>    2 Encode text with q-p and tag as application/o-s (Current Pine)
>       - Less reliable

This rumor of unreliability is of concern to us.  I think that application/o-s
should indicate that newline processing should not be done, hence Pine vs
MailManager's cat-fight over text attachments (Pine attaches as text,
MailManager attaches as binary).

Whether the data is in q-p or base64 should be irrelevant to the text vs
binary issue; the typing should indicate this

Here is my feeling on the matter of the ``right'' thing to do:

ATTACHING:
 - Select binary vs text.  Text data is a sequence of mostly printable
   characters and formatters (e.g. CTRL/L) terminated by the *local* system's
   newline convention (CTRL/J on Unix, CTRL/M CTRL/J on DOS, CTRL/M on Mac,
   etc.).  So this is an osdep decision.  Text that exhibits some other
   line convention (e.g. CTRL/M's appearing in the data on Unix) should be
   automatically disqualified as text and labelled as binary.
   - if text, apply newline conversion to internet standard CR/LF.  Set type
     to be TEXT/FILE, APPLICATION/TEXT, whatever is decided as P.C. for this.
   - if binary, set type to APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM
 - Determine base64 vs q-p encoding
   - if text, default to q-p, unless there is an excessive amount of 8th bit
     and non-printable CTRL characters (e.g. nulls, CTRL/C, etc.) that would
     make a q-p segment likely to be longer than base64.
   - if binary, default to base64, unless there is a paucity of 8th bit and
     non-printable CTRL characters that would make a q-p segment likely to be
     shorter than base64.

DETACHING:
 - apply q-p or base64 decoding as possible.
 - process the resulting data:
   - if APPLICATION/TEXT (or whatever) convert all CR/LF to local newline.
   - if APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM, write without conversions

Essentially, the encoding format should say nothing about newlines.  It is the
type that should say this, as follows:
 - APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM should say that ``this is a sequence of octets
   that should be written to a file without any attempt to change it to local
   data conventions.''
 - APPLICATION/TEXT should say ``this is text in Internet newline format that
   you may need to convert to local data conventions.''
TOPS-20 ;-) and DOS machines will happily ignore the difference, but everyone
else would have to do newline conversions for APPLICATION/TEXT.

I think that MIME made a big mistake in trying to mesh encodings (base64, q-p,
7bit, 8bit) with the newline problem.  I should have understood this back
then, but I didn't.  It's a terrible mixing of layers to have q-p try to
understand ``newlines'' vs. CR, LF, and CR LF.  I wonder if we can fix this in
MIME without endangering its standards track process by saying ``this is
merely a deletion of what we've realized is a bad idea''.

Not a bad idea, but I would turn it around:

 Content-type: text/plain; source=file

or

 Content-type: text/plain; source=message

I think it is imperative that text objects get typed as "text", lest the NL
stuff gets messed up...

And now we've gone full circle, because now we have TEXT/PLAIN being used both
for text which is intended to be read by a human in the mail reader, and
application data which just happens to be in text/Internet new line form.

At the very least, we need a separate subtype that clearly states that:
 1) it is application data
 2) it is text using Internet newlines

It is a matter of religion whether or not it is a subtype of APPLICATION or of
TEXT, and I am ecumenical on this question; although I somewhat think that
APPLICATION is more appropriate (note that MESSAGE also has ``text'').

We can delete from q-p all the crap about newline handling if we separate text
vs. binary at the upper levels.

So, I see it as the addition on one subtype (as a bug fix) and the deletion of
text (as unnecessary); hopefully miminal damage and not enough to endanger its
progression to Draft.

This looks like it would work great for Pine! Possibly the parameter
should be name=<file> since that's what is used with application/o-s.
Pine will display all text without the name parameter and treat that with
the name parameter as a displayable attachment.

This will solve the problem for Pine, but for the sake of ineroperability
it seems like it would be good to persue something more formal like Mark
has suggested, so other implementors figure out how do deal with this.

Hi -

     I'm surprised that your system really cares about the precise contents of
the Message-ID, since it is defined syntactically only.  I hope this is only
an esthetic issue.

     However, it really is important that the fully-qualified domain name
(FQDN) be listed before any nicknames or non-FQDNs in any host table.  In
several places internally, Pine uses the results of the equivalent of:
  gethostname (tmp,TMPLEN);
  myhostname = gethostbyname (tmp)->h_name;
to get the fully-qualified domain name.

     You may have other strange side effects caused by Pine's inability to get
the FQDN.  I'm surprised you haven't seen any by now.  Arguably, it's a bug
that YP and host tables allow a non-FQDN to show up as the result of the above
code sequence, but the sad reality is that they do...  :-(

     On my machines, I use FQDNs in my bootparams.  In general, I consider
non-FDQNs to be only for user typing convenience, and stick to FQDNs in all
configuration files, etc.  It makes life a lot easier and simpler just to
assume that only FQDN's work.  If you can do this, this may help a lot.

     Another possibility is to punt things like YP and NetInfo and stick with
the DNS, but I understand that that may not be a feasible or useful suggestion
for you.

We had the same situation as the poster; for historical reasons we do not
have the FQDN in the hosts table. I wanted to ensure that the message-ID
contained the FQDN to ensure that the message-id's generated were unique.
I suppose it might be aesthetic only, but I can't see how you can
guarantee that message-ids are unique if you don't use the FQDN.

I think that the only place that obtains the hostname is the OS specific
files (os-unx.c, etc). This is stored into hostname[] for use elsewhere.
Based on this assumption I made a simple modification to gethostname() to
ensure that hostname[] always had our domain name taked onto its end.

I agree with you, and if we started our systems from scratch we'd use
FQDNs everywhere. However, at the moment and for the immediate future we
are stuck with short names (changing to FQDN is not a trivial task, since
the hostname is used as a key is many places which will break when it is
changed).

What library calls or other do you use to look up to domain you tack on? 
You might just send the code.

This is a common annoyance with Pine and I would like to see it fixed, but
in a way that folks installing Pine wouldn't have to worry about it. (No
compile time configuration).

I'm afraid I don't do anything clever (or portable!) - just a straight
modification to os-unx.c to force the adding of our domain (which is
hard-coded in, ugh!). (It would be better if it got the domain from the
user-domain, maybe, or from the DNS, but I wanted to make the minimum
amount of changes to the source code so that I could apply it to future
versions without hassle!). 

Still, it works for us, so it may be useful, so here's the context diff
(if you aren't using os-unx as your OS specific files you'll have to apply
this to os-???.c instead).

Ian and Mike,
Some form of shared address book is definitely on the enhancement list...
We just need someone to give us one of those "Round TuIt" things :)

One question is whether this should be a simple extension to the personal
address book (but searched *after* the personal one, or whether it should
be an interface to whois/x.500/etc, or are both mechanisms desirable?  I
suspect the answer is "both", but comments are welcome.  (Obviously the
former is easier than the latter and would therefore be likely to appear
sooner!)

Ian, Terry:

As we have both X.500 and whois here at UWO, this topic was one
of the first to come up when we decided to go with pine.

I've made some changes to our local pine in order to allow some interaction
with a generic directory server program (using whois as the default).  With
the work I've done so far you can invoke whois with ^W from either the
'ADDRESS BOOK' screen or the 'COMPOSE' screen (from the header fields
only).  A search key is prompted for and the results displayed as a
'HELP' screen (I cheated a bit here, but it works nicely).
I've also added a 'directory-access' entry to the .pinerc file, as we're
also working on a local version of whois.

The next step is to figure out a way to pull an address from the whois
lookup into the appropriate mail header field.  At this point the
interface is purely visual.

For the brave... A diff file containing the whois changes is available
on julian.uwo.ca as ~ftp/pub/unix/mail/pine-3.05/uwo-whois.diff.  All
changes are #ifdef'd with 'WHOIS'.   Suggestions are welcome.

Option 1 would be of significant value to our group as well. We are on the
verge of having a distinct need for a global address book. The sooner you
can get TuIt, the better :)

It sounds like you've made some significant additions Mike; perhaps you
should consider submitting them so that they can be included in a future
release of pine?

I will definitely give your diffs a try. 

Thanks for your helpful response,

Ian.

I have been using Pine (3.05) on an Ultrix platform for some time and
find it excellent. However a problem has arisen over the past few days,
which hasme puzzled. On certain messages, the From: field is being
incorrectly parsed. Eg.

With Header info on here is the From address

Ned Freed <<@INTERBIT.BITNET:NED@SIGURD.INNSOFT.COM>>

however the message is showing as coming from

	ned@itdsrv1.ul.ie    where itdsrv1.ul.ie is my own domain address.

The entry in .pine-debug file is this:

Can anyone throw some light on this.

Yes, that's the problem. The only two ways I know to find out a systems
domain is to query the hosts table, DNS, NIS... or to read
/etc/resolv.conf. The best way to do it is to look it up with DNS, NIS and
such, but if you've got the entries in your hosts table unqualified
there's not much that can be done. 

I think you wind up having to have some hueristic that tries to decided if
the name you've got is fully qualified or not. (It could have a list of
top level domains hard coded or require at least two clauses separated by
a dot.) 

Given that we don't want the method set at compile time there are two
choices. (Don't want extra configuration hassle for system administrators
since ease of administration is also a Pine goal). 

1. Look up the name in /etc/hosts (DNS, NIS or YP) and try and fully
   qualify it with whats in /etc/resolv.conf if it's not qualified

2. Get the systems idea of the host name (via the hostname() call), decide
   if it's fully qualified or not and then try and fully qualify it 
   with what's in /etc/resolv.conf

Wither case we have to have the hueristic to decide if a name is fully
qualified or not, and this seems like a bad idea.

Personally, I would suggest just overriding all the look ups by setting
the user-domain in the .pinerc or pine.conf files. This does leave the
message ID unqualified, but I'd guess the likelyhood of a problem is
small. Most applications don't use it, and most host names are unique
(unless you use pc1-n, mac1-n or names of planets). 

Perhaps a solution to this in Pine might be to use the longer of the name
looked up in /etc/hosts and the name set in the user-domain variable,
assuming the longer is more unique.

Hope this makes sense....

It's not a legal RFC-822 address is all the problem:

 "Ned Freed <<@INTERBIT.BITNET:NED@SIGURD.INNSOFT.COM>>"

It shouldn't have the double "<". I don't know where they are coming from,
but it looks like some gateway is not doing the right thing. Perhaps Mark
can shed some more light on this.

Denis -

     The problem is with the two angle brackets in the address
	Ned Freed <<@INTERBIT.BITNET:NED@SIGURD.INNOSOFT.COM>>
This totally confuses Pine's parser, which looks for addresses in the
following order:
	human name <@relay:user@host>
	human name <user@host>
	user@host
	user
What happens is that ``Ned'' satisfies the final rule.  It then expects to see
a comma or the end of string; instead, it encounters ``Freed''.

     Garbage In, Garbage Out...  ;-)

     My suspicion is that the INTERBIT gateway was responsible for this.  Most
likely, it left Ned's machine as
	Ned Freed <NED@SIGURD.INNOSOFT.COM>
and the INTERBIT gateway has a rule that says ``turn user@host into
<INTERBIT.BITNET:user@host>'', failing to check for the address already being
in the bracketed format.

     Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist you in
composing a bug report to the INTERBIT gateway maintainer.

Hello,

I am having a problem with pine 3.05 running on a DEC 5000/133, Ultrix
4.2A. I don't know how long it's been going on but it was just brought
to my attention. What happens is pine sometimes stores mail in /tmp. The
tech notes says that it does this and then starts sendmail in the
background to send these off. The store part seems to be happening but
sendmail never sends them out. I don't think it happens a lot or /tmp
would be filling up every day. I have > 600 users using pine and only
one person has complained but I have about 15 messages up to 3 days old
after which cron removes them so I am not sure how many have been
removed. I have many pleased pine users but I have to solve this problem
ASAP. By the way all the messages seem to have good headers.
Thanks

In the Pine blurb on ftp sites, there's a mention of a port of Pine
to the MS-DOS platform being "well underway".

I'm looking for a good mail reader to port to the Waffle (an MS-DOS
UUCP package) environment, to replace Waffle's stock reader.

Does anyone know if the MS-DOS Pine port is still in progress, does
it have a projected release date, who's doing it, what sorts of
problems are they having if it's taking this long...  

I'm ready to do the port myself, but don't want to duplicate effort
nor get into something that's infeasable.  Any word on this?

Steve,
PC-Pine is *still* "well underway" :)

Our best guess at the moment is that we'll have a general beta release
ready in about 4 weeks (around the ides of March :)

We *think* that release will be pretty stable, in terms of the key
functionality; in fact, it appears to be pretty stable now, but we still
need to sort out some issues on folder namespaces (especially remote
folders) and mailbox driver control. 

And yes, it was a *lot* harder than it looked.  Mostly trying to squeeze
things into a 640K address space, while still being able to deal with
arbitrarily large mailboxes and arbitrarily large MIME attachments.
(We won't talk about the weeks lost discovering and working around
Microsoft bugs...)  All of the work has been done by Mike Seibel, who has
been working on it for 7 months, at about 80 hours a week, with low-level
library support from Mark Crispin.

The functionality is equivalent to the Unix version except that it doesn't
have a spelling checker yet, plus it has a few new things that will also
show up in the next Unix version.  (Anyone have a spelling checker that is
fast and doesn't use any memory? :) It is also mouse-aware (though not a
true Windows app.) The initial release will include versions for packet
driver (based on WATTCP), Novel LWP, and PC-TCP stacks.

The work done in c-client (which is really more like a ``kernel'' than a
``library'' these days) would make an interesting case study: how you convince
software that was written with a ``memory is cheaper than bandwidth'' frame of
mind to run on a machine where the exact opposite is true?

What ended up being done was rather clever, if I could be so immodest.  The
first step, and perhaps the least used, was the ability to purge the c-client
caches (or selected parts thereof).  I say ``least used'' because it turned
out that wasn't enough by a long shot.  There's a lesson in this for people
who think the IMAP2bis ``PURGE'' functionality is helpful.

The second step was to control the scope of the caches.  Eliminating message
text caching happened early on, along with a mechanism to pipe the data
through a routine rather than praying that it'd be a short enough (char *)
string to fit inside a 64K DOS segment.  The next to go was envelope caching;
while a big performance win it did take up a surprising amount of memory.

The final step was putting all cache management under the control of a cache
manager routine which can be overridden by the main program (and is overridden
by PC Pine).  This mechanism is amazingly flexible, and Mike has done things
with his cache manager to poor ol' c-client's data structures that I never
dreamed possible -- not to mention possibly illegal under the morality laws of
certain states.......;-)

Using the cache manager capability, a fully-functional c-client can be induced
to use no memory at all modulo temporary storage.  The result is a version of
Pine that runs competantly (if somewhat slowly) even on an XT!

Goodness!  I'm glad I asked.  Some credit is definitely due there.

I've just started porting the 'tin' newsreader, and haven't yet
gotten anywhere near running make, let alone trying to load the
thing.  Here's hoping 'tin' is small enough...

I'll keep my eyes open.  Is the beta going to be copied to the ftp
directory?

Incidentally, one of the things we've been working on in the background in
mail and news integration.  For sites that store news on the same machine
that has user home directories (in particular, .newsrc files), it is
possible to use Pine/IMAP for reading news today, though more work is
needed on the user interface.  Mark has just finished the first cut of an
NNTP driver for C-client, so we expect that PC-Pine will be able to read
news using either a central .newsrc model via IMAP, or a local/desktop
.newsrc model via NNTP. Not sure how soon we'll have the pieces together,
but it is coming.   We haven't done anything about posting yet.

I'm sure tin will have superior news reading functionality for awhile
anyway, but we think there is merit in providing a common UI to both
worlds.

Definitely.  And of course there will be an anouncement posted to
pine-info and pine-announce.

There's been some discussion lately about using Pine as a newsreader.
We've set this up here and are delighted with the functionality. 

Version 3.05 does not offer an option to post messages, but posting _can_
be done from within Pine using a post-news-via-mail service. The only host
I know of is that mentioned in the attached message. I've verified that it
works, but it took four or five days to appear as "news" back here.

There are several ways to send mail to post to a newgroup.  Here is one,
and the way that this message was posted. 

comp-mail-misc@cs.utexas.edu

Where: comp-mail-misc is one's favorite newsgroup delimited by dashes (-)
instead of the customary dot (.) format.

There are a few hosts that will post for you, but my doc file seems to be
missing.

We're having problems with some of our X25 connected terminals and Pine.

Our comms expert tells me that all Pine output to the screen is 8 bit with
the top bit unset; Pine demands that input is also in this form. We see no
problems with telnet sessions, nor with serial terminals that are set to 8
bit no parity. 

Is it possible for Pine to communicate properly with a 7 bit terminal?

Pine uses cbreak mode, at least on BSD based UNIX's, which I believe
implies the terminal driver generates the parity. The first thing to check
would be the tty parameters. If Pine where running in RAW more then it
would be different. Also, if you're running Pine on a System V box this
might be different, but I suspect the problem is still in the tty driver
settings. 

It is a little different if you set the character-set parameter to
iso-8859-X. Then Pine sets up the tty a little different (stty pass8) and
expects 8 bit input. Otherwise Pine ignores all bits above the 7th. It
does this intentionally to be tolerant of incorrect parity settings. When
8 bit characters are used, obviously it can't ignore the eigth bit. 

I guess I don't have an exact answer, but in general Pine doesn't know
much about the parity and number of bits sent.

One of our uses has been maintaining a mailing list with DISMAN on a VAX,
but has run into all sorts of problems with bounced and repeating messages.
He's asked us to set up LISTSERV software to use instead, but I wondered
if there was another alternative -- Pine.

So, what experiences do people have maintaining mailing lists with Pine?
How big are your mailing lists, and how well do they work? Is Pine-Info
maintained with Pine?

Thanks,

Thanks, to you both, for the suggestion!  Pine's integrated spelling
function is pretty limited right now, and improving this is on the list
for the future. 

In the mean time, there's a neat work around courtesy of the "editor="
variable in your .pinerc.  Setting this to "ispell" (may need to specify
the full path), will cause the "^_ Alt Edit" label to appear on the key
prompt line when the cursor is in the body of your composition.  Hitting
ctrl-underscore will launch ispell on the contents of your message, and
drop you back into the composer with the new text when ispell exits. 

Haven't played with this much myself, but I hope it helps...

Messages coming in from firn (the Florida school network) now cause pine to
die a horrible death.  Attached below is a sample.  Put this in a pine
folder, and you can see pine wither.  I have seen similar behavior under
SunOS and Ultrix, both with version 3.05.  The firn headers look a little
odd to me, but I don't see anything obviously wrong with them.  The
Alternate-recipient and Disclose-recipients headers are something new to
me.  I'm not sure if they have been part of the firn headers previously.

Cheers!
Bob Carlitz

Please send me more information on your project Veli Joze.  We are a middle 
school in Sarasota, Florida, using the modem from the media center.  I am 
wondering what our obligation would be in addition to the pen pal letters?  I 
have 3 students interested in this project.  Would the letters be sent by 
e-mail?  or by surface mail from our end?  Is this an open-ended project?  How 
would replies from Veli Joze be received?  We really would like more 
information.  Thanks,

Bob -

     Thank you for your bug report, and for providing sample data that causes
the problem.  This problem is a c-client bug in handling invalid MIME data.

     The cause of the crash is evil data in the headers; the message claims to
be in MIME format (``Mime-Version: 1.0''), and there is a ``Content-Type:''
header line.  However, there is no data for that header.  The parser detected
the error and declined to attempt to parse the Content-Type: information.
Unfortunately, the error case was bundled with the ``not a Content-Type
header, try Content-Transfer-Encoding'' case, and it fell into that code with
invalid context.  The fix was to implement the error case separately.

     A patch to the c-client module rfc822.c is MIME attached to this message.
Please let me know if you need any assistance in installing this patch on your
system.

     If you could, please also ask your correspondent at Florida to inquire as
to what could be causing her mailer to send invalid MIME data to you.  I guess
this is an X.400/MIME gateway that is behind all this, but there is inadequate
information to be sure.

Thanks for the work around Mike. I can see that this has potential, but
I like to use this key to launch emacs; I can then access ispell from
within emacs. It would be nice to see this feature in a future release of
pine, and I am pleased that you have added this to your list :-)

Ian.

In the "COMPOSE MESSAGE" screen, typing a nickname from the address book
returns the full address and full name.  In ELM, the same expansion
happens when a local user name is entered.

Can this feature be added to PINE, either as default behaviour or as an
option?

Earl,

Pine was not designed to handle the administration of mailing lists.
Some people use the addressbook feature for very small lists, but that's
about it.

We have lots of mailing lists (including pine-info) and have turned
to other software to manage them.  We use a program called Majordomo
for managing the pine-info list.

Hello,

Pine should do that now. I believe there is one case where it won't do
it -- when you explicity set the user-domain in the
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf file to be different from the local domain. In
this case Pine decides that it doesn't make sense to expand the names. 
Are you setting user-domain or use-only-domain-name?

Greetings:-

We have recently had some interesting discussions re: global addressbooks
under pine. Perhaps an addition to our discussion, would be to allow
access to addressbooks via imapd. 

For example, suppose I decide that fred.yorku.ca will be the host that I
will use for storing my mail messages, and where I will keep my
.addressbook. If I am doing some work on barney.yorku.ca, it would be
really nice if the .addressbook on fred.yorku.ca could be consulted via
something analogous to imapd for my mail aliases. Currently, I update my
.addressbook on fred.yorku.ca, and manually (**gasp**) ftp a copy over to
my account on barney.yorku.ca. 

Ian.

------------------

The next pine release will have a proper AIX 3.2 port, but unfortunately,
it won't be ready for a couple of months. 

The good news is, the AIX 3.2 port contributor, John Eisenmenger at Duke,
has made a port of the current pine version, v3.05, available to the net.
A copy is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.egr.duke.edu in the
directory "archives/network" under the filename "pine3.05a.tar.Z".

Ian -

     Thank you for your suggestion.  The idea of distributing address book
information has been on the list of ideas for a long time.  You aren't the
only person who has been annoyed by having to FTP around copies of the address
book every time a trivial update is made!!

     It isn't necessarily desirable to do it in imapd, since you may want to
distribute address book information in non-IMAP environments as well.  Also,
you may have multiple IMAP servers in an organization which will give you all
the problems that having separate address books on clients would.

     In the draft IMSP (IMAP support protocol) definition I read, CMU suggests
that address books may be part of directory service.  This makes a lot of
sense to me.

     In any case, I think we will need to do something about distributing
address books.  I hope it's ``sooner'' rather than ``later''!  ;-)

One of my users is having problems printing Pine stuff via ProComm Plus
for Windows.

For example, say he wants to print one of the help screens... he gets the
screen up on his display and presses L.  The Windows Print Manager is
started but nothing is printed.

Ok, so he tries to use the "Capture" facility to log the session.  Only
the first screen and the last screen appear in the log, even if all the
help pages displayed on his screen.

Any ideas?

BTW, we have had no problems using ProComm or ProComm Plus in DOS.

Try the "Capture" facility in conjuction with the "attached-to-ansi" Pine
print option.  I use Zterm to connect a Mac to a NeXT. The "attached-to-ansi"
and "Capture text..."  writes the message to a file which I print later.

Many terminal programs have to be told to capture upon receipt of the
screen "clear" character instead of as the material scrolls off the
screen. That solved the problem for me on a couple of different programs.
There are a zillion options to pcplus, I don't know where they hide that
one, but I am certain they would support it.

good luck,
Alan

We've just put up a local help file and find that most of the standard
help has disappeared! We get the main heading and contents list, then
the local page, then help on folders. That's it.

What's happened?

	University of Reading Computer Services Centre

This is Pine, a public-domain (i.e. freely available) mail program
that originated in the University of Washington. Pine was designed for
novice computer users; for this reason it offers fewer facilities than
some other electronic mail tools.

If you have problems using Pine at Reading, telephone the CSC Advisory
helpline on Reading 317145 between 9:30-12.00 or 2.30-5.00 on
weekdays, or (if possible) mail a message to Advisory@Reading.ac.uk.

Typing	 man pine   at the Unix prompt will produce a manual entry
for Pine, listing its command line options and other parameters that
you can set for yourself.

A background document, "pine-tech-notes" in several formats can be found 
in /usr/local/lib.

There's a bug in Pine 3.05 that will cause weird things to happen if the
custom help text is longer than the place holder text that's there now.
That's about 19 lines. I think you're just over that. Let us know if this
solves the problem or not.

Content-Description: Our local help file


	University of Reading Computer Services Centre

This is Pine, a public-domain (i.e. freely available) mail program
that originated in the University of Washington. Pine was designed for
novice computer users; for this reason it offers fewer facilities than
some other electronic mail tools.

If you have problems using Pine at Reading, telephone the CSC Advisory
helpline on Reading 317145 between 9:30-12.00 or 2.30-5.00 on
weekdays, or (if possible) mail a message to Advisory@Reading.ac.uk.

Typing	 man pine   at the Unix prompt will produce a manual entry
for Pine, listing its command line options and other parameters that
you can set for yourself.

A background document, "pine-tech-notes" in several formats can be found 
in /usr/local/lib.

Greetings Jianxin:-

There's a pc version of pine that should be ready in a few months, I
believe, that might serve your purposes.

I have little problems to create mails with accentuated chars and to=3D20
read mails with such chars. I tried many combinations in .pinerc
and pine.conf but failed. It seems that I can't set ISO char in=20
my mails.

for example, if I compose a message with an =E9 ( e with acute accent ),=20
and then I postpone it, when I get it back the letter is changed
in =3DE29.=20

If I receive a mail with such an accent, I read i which is the 7-bit=20
corresponding char.=20

The above happens when I choose ISO-8859-1 and show-all-characters=3Dyes=20

My system is a DECstation 5000/240 running Ultrix 4.2A.

Any idea?

This happens, as far as I understand PINE, because PINE immediately
interprets your input and converts it to MIME's quoted-printable
encoding before writing it to the mail file. The problem is, that it's
not redisplayed the way you would expect when you resume editing a
postponed mail, and consequently you suddenly see the quoted-printable
stuff.

This should be a terminal problem since it's a problem with
bitstripping. You need stty -istrip, maybe more.

Yes, I believe there's some definite bugs in Pine when postpoing messages
with 8 bit characters in them. There's also a bug in Pine 3.05 for
displaying 8 bit characters on some systems. I don't have the patched
handy, but there are patched for it.

Subject: Disks 811-820 now available


Disks 811-820 are now available.  Shipping to all those who have preordered
disks should be complete by 18-Jan-93.

Note that you can get a copy of the catalog (2 disks) of the complete library
contents by sending $3 for disks, postage, and mailer to:

	Fred Fish
	Catalog Disk Requests
	1835 East Belmont Drive
	Tempe, Arizona  85284
	USA

Thanks to all who submitted new and interesting material.  If you submitted
something in the past and it has not yet appeared in the library, please
feel free to resubmit it, particularly if it was several months ago.  I
sometimes hesitate to include material submitted more than about six
months ago because of some vague feeling that as soon as I include version
1.01 submitted many months ago, I'll see version 5.23 posted on usenet.

For those wishing to submit material for possible inclusion in the library,
here are a few simple guidelines that will make my job of organizing the
material MUCH easier and GREATLY increase your chances of having the material
accepted for inclusion:

1.	Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other sort of
	proprietary material included, since I then have to go examine
	each file to decide if it is distributable or not, and if not,
	what effect removing it might have.  Unless the material is
	particularly interesting, I frequently just toss such disks
	into the recycling bin.

2.	Organize the distribution in a manner similar to my disks.  I.E,
	place all files related to a particular submission under a single
	directory on the disk.  If there is more than one submission per
	disk, place each submission in its own directory.

3.	Try to write a simple entry for my "Contents" listing that
	summarizes your submission.  It should be about 3-10 lines, and
	include the current version number, the version and disk number
	of the most recent version (if any) that was last included in the
	library, whether or not source is included, and an "Author" list.

4.	Ensure that your submission will run correctly from its sub-
	directory and if necessary, supply a script runnable from workbench
	(via :c/xicon or c:iconx) that makes all necessary assigns, copies
	fonts and libraries, etc.

5.	Send your submission in a sturdy envelope with sufficient padding.

Thanks!!!

We also recomend you look at Chameleon.  Also, look at Beame *
Whiteside's product which is very similar to Chameleon plus it has the
added advantage of running either in DOS or Windows or both at the same
time.  It also has whois, nntp, timed, telnetd (up e.g., to 20 people
can remotely log onto your PC and run DOS applications).  That last
point may be useful for us to allow cc:mail people (if we decide to go
that way - can't wait for DOS-pine) to access their e-mail remotely
without carrying a laptop all the time.  I'm not sure but I did hear
from one person that Novell have/will buy out B&W.  Novell's current
Lanworks for DOS is also very similar but not as feature packed as B&W.

One a very similar thread:  could someone please help me decide between
MS-Mail and cc:mail?  I like and dislike both for various reasons but
cc:mail to me appears a better solution for us due to the smtp gateway
that runs on Suns.  The catch is that the PC (and some MAC) uses use MS
type applications like Word for Windows and Excel so MS-Mail mail be a
better choice in the longer term.  True?

Fo OS/2 IBM's TCP/IP package is terrific.  It even includes X emulation if
you buy it.  The combination (OS/2 and TCP/IP) is real smooth to
install, operate, and maintain.  In contrast, doing this kind of thing
DOS or DOS with Windows is a hassle.  True multitasking really does have
benefits.

I realize the help screens include just about everything users need to
know, but that is mostly useful *after* they've begun using Pine.  What do
you do to introduce Pine to new email users at your site?

Seminars and demos are effective for people at my office, but I have many
more users that are remote.  Any ideas for them?

Ideally, I'd like to be able to provide my users with a short document
describing the Pine basics and how they can learn more about the features
available to them.  If nobody has written one, I'll take a crack at it and
share it with anyone that is interested.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Well, I'm the sole supporter of it here, and what I've found to work is
just telling the person how to start it up...  They ask 'How do I ____'
once or twice, but you tell them to just read the screen...  They learn on
their own that way and it seems to have worked very well here...

However, if I decide to reply to that fellow, the To header field
becomes:

"frmrc::a1_evoai2::bastoul.jean-charles"@nova15.vbo.dec.com

I can't use that address and I need to modify it by hand. However, my
sendmail.cf knows how to handle DECnet addresses and the first address is
fine because sendmail will modify it properly before sending.

What I am looking for is a kind of switch for allowing or not address
expansion.

I did not find anything in the compose menu allowing including a 
specific mail in the body text. I could workaround by exporting and 
then read file which is fine but heavy. 

Of course, I am not speaking of forwarding but but including a 
mail. Did I miss this somewhere ?.

There really isn't any way to turn off address expansion in Pine. It's
pretty deeply ingranined, but I believe the address that results from the
expansion you give below should work fine. It's just adding the local host
name on the end; your sendmail should be smart enough to know what to do
with it if it can handle DECnet mail. We've pretty much intentionally made
Pine follow RFC-822 closely because we believe that adhering to standards
will increase interoperability and the quality of the product.

The way to do this in Pine now is to use the export command to write the
message to a file and then include the file with the ^R command in the
composer. Would be nice if there was a better way...

Is there a philosophical reason a "Return-Receipt-To:" header is not
available with the Rich Header option?  It would be useful.

Even more useful would be a method for a sender to check the Status: line
of a message sent to another user.  I keep getting questions like "How do
I know they read my message?"  Any suggestions?

The Return-Receipt-To header is extremely controversial.  It is not part of
any standards; rather, it is a local feature implemented inside the UNIX
sendmail and not in other mailers.

Thus, there is no guarantee that you will get a return receipt; the absence of
a receipt does not mean that that the user did not get the message, just as
the absence of a human-generated acknowledgement or reply does not.

Some people, including me, are opposed to the functionality on privacy
grounds.  I patched out the return receipt functionality in sendmail on my
workstations.  If I do not acknowledge or reply to a message, I have a
specific reason for not doing so; and do not want a program to override my
wishes.

There has been talk about a voluntary facility that would prompt the user
agent to say, when the receipient reads the mail, ``the sender requested that
this message be acknowledged.  Shall I send an acknowledgement?''  The problem
is, since it's a voluntary functionality, it would suffer all the problems of
uncertainty that return receipts would.

This is something that would be even more abhorrant, even to people who accept
the return receipt functionality as attractive.  It requires a program to dig
into another user's private data.

	Since it is only a receipt of delivery to your mail box, and
does not in anyway guarantee that you have seen them message, I'm not
sure I see the philosophical problem.  All it does is inform the
sender that the various mail links are functioning.

I occasionally receive email that I want no acknowledgement of its delivery
returned to the sender.  That is, I expressly want to be able to deny having
ever received the message if questioned.  Sometimes, an ``e-mail black hole''
is the only way to get rid of certain individuals.

If the sender really wants to check the mail links, the sender could send a
round-trip message using something like the % hack.  For example, I could send
a message to mrc%panda.com@world.std.com to see if mail to/from world.std.com
works from Panda.  But, I claim that I have no right to know whether or not a
message I sent makes it to spike@world.std.com's mailbox unless Joe Ilacqua
decides to give me that information.

If it's really important to me that I know if the message got there, I will
say ``Please acknowledge this message immediately.''  If Joe wants to do that,
he can do a reply with the single word ``ack'' as a message.  If he doesn't,
well, he doesn't.  It's his choice.  A programmed procedure eliminates that
choice.

Consider, too, the frightening possibility of lawsuits getting served via
email in light of the well-known irresponsible ways that people sometimes use
email.

However, the bottom line is that there is at present *no* standard way of
requesting return receipts, only various (different and non-interoperable)
hacks in different mailers.  If all your correspondents use sendmail on UNIX,
and none of them are nasty sorts like me that deliberately patched the code
out, then you could have a working receipt facility.  That is not a realistic
set of assumptions to make on the Internet.

I don't see any particular reason why Pine shouldn't make it possible to send
a Return-Receipt-To header.  On the other hand, who can take responsibility
for making sure it works?

<You are confusing a delivery-receipt with a read-receipt

	I don't think I'm confused at all. We are talking about the
"Return-Receipt-To:" header (see the Subject: and Mark's message)
which I have never seen implemented to do anything other than delivery
receipt.  I've never seen a read receipt implementation, and I think
that you couldn't do it without mailer cooperation.

I thought that Return-Receipt-To simply acknowledges receipt of the
mail by the host, *not* that the mail has necessarily been read by
the receiver.  Is that not correct?

	You don't have to guarantee it works, as there is no way the

What difference does that make?  Having my host say ``I got the message and
deposited it in his mailbox'' still conveys more information than I may
necessarily wish to convey.

You may think it's your right, but if the recipient chooses to run a mailer
that does not pay any attention to your request for a receipt then you have no
way of forcing him to do so.

So, the person who thinks it's his right not to give you that information is
going to win out.  So is the person who thinks it's his right not to bother
implementing it.

These acknowledgements are voluntary.  There is no particular reason to
believe that a request for a human-generated acknowledgement will work any
worse than a request for a mailer-generated acknowledgement.  Provably, there
are cases where the latter will not work at all.

On the contrary, I have heard rumors of exactly that possibility on a
commercial e-mail system, and I've seen articles in the trade rags about
electronic delivery of legal process.

Anyway, I am not the person to convince about whether or not Pine should
generate that header.  I'm just speaking my mind as a user here.

I think this discussion has been hashed out fully, so I'm not going to say any
more.

I think this is an application issue, not a problem with
Return-Receipt-To:.  I think you are requesting a capability within
sendmail to - on a case-by-case basis - refuse acknowledgement of
receipt to particular individuals when the destination is you.  

But the vast majority of people who use this feature simply want to
know that the mail arrived intact.  I know I never use that header
unless I'm dealing with someone on a mail system that loses mail, so
having acknowledgement of receipt is quite important.

But it's all we've got, and it sort of works in 80% of the cases.  I
can't understand something that is useful 80% of the time just
because occasionally it is not.

We actually had a read-receipt implementation -- it was in an _old_ local
email system that I re-wrote (about 8 years ago) from scratch.  The
re-implemented system also included read-receipt.  We've since switched to
pine and have gladly dropped the read-receipt and delivery-receipt features.

Please note that the biggest complaint about pine from our approx. 750
users has been that it doesn't have read-receipt in it like our old
system.  They've stopped clamoring about that now and seem to be quite
please with pine, excepting those few users who like to open a log file on
the PC when they first go into mail and close it when they leave,
expecting to see a perfectly formatted stream of the text of all messages
read.  Most of these users are happy to put up with this in order to get
the other features of pine like multiple enclosures (our old system had a
single enclosure available -- a homegrown concept then).

This subject has been debated in other forums, and I'm aware of 
Mark Crispin's feelings on the matter ( and agree with a lot of
his privacy reservations ) BUT, it still stands that:

 - delivery-receipts AND read-receipts are something a lot of USERS
   want ( and sometimes NEED ) and when you tell them that read-receipts
   don't really do what they might think they do, they will tell you that 
   what they want is for you to make them work better - not to get
   rid of them. ( And they will take whatever limited functionality 
   they currently offer in the mean time. ) 

 - Delivery-receipts AND read-receipts ARE implemented in several systems. 
   ( usually non portable, non standard and proprietary ) 

 - email thru multiple gateways is unreliable enough that even delivery
   receipts are useful. Sometimes 3 days for a bounce message is an 
   unacceptable time to wait for a NACK. And out-of-band phone verification
   is also often out of the question. ( If we could get them on the phone
   then we wouldn't be using email in many cases. Researchers in the former
   Soviet Union, for example, usually tell us to use email because the phone
   system is so poor! ) 


And, I _might_ add (IMHO), that there are business and commercial uses that
will require (read or delivery) receipts. But then many of those uses will
also require sender verification, public-key-encryption and other security
features, form-letter replies, in addition to a more reliable receipt capability. 

But since I've heard there may be enough potential problems just getting MIME 
and PEM to work together, ( and I expect that any internet standard approach
to the above will end up using those two as building blocks ), I'll forgive
you, Mark, if you don't want to waste YOUR time on it. :-) 

BUT: I managed to keep my damn mount shut the last 3 or 4 times this 
topic came up. I weakened this time because it's late AND I want to 
ask: Is there an architectural overview - an Email Reference Model - 
of how responsibilities should be partitioned between the user agent 
and the delivery agent ( and imap and other parts of the mail system ). 
My impression is that OSI terminology has sort of been bolted onto 
current practice, but that there is not really a very clear model. 


But I guess this is getting out of the pine-info mailing list realm.

I think you've got a lot of good points in favor of r-r-r here. Certainly
it's needed for EDI like applications in the future, though I think a lot
of the need for verification now is because users are new and insecure
about e-mail. 

I think the ironic thing about the current r-r-r: is that it's probability of
working is about the same as the message going through so it doesn't get
you very much. For example if you go through a a gateway to FidoNet or
such where the messages is likely to get lost, the r-r-r is also likely to
get lost because it's no longer SMTP and sendmail.

I think the gating issue for Pine is clearly the lack of standards for
this. The idea in Pine is to stick with standards to keep interoperability
and quality as high as possible. There was a mailing list where some
Internet standards folks were hashing some of this out, but I think the
effort sort of petered out, mostly due to technical difficulties making it
work across gateways.

Why not use the following

Generate-Delivery-Report:

This can be used to request a delivery report when sending mail from
Internet through an X400 gateway, and is mentioned in the latest RFC
relating to Internet to X400 gateways/message transfer.

Michael (M.D.Rowe1@lut.ac.uk)

PS. I can't remember the RFC number I think it could be RFC 1123,
I'm not sure. It only has a passing mention in an otherwise large
document. It is also refered to in earlier RFC's on the subject.

I agree with that point. And another reason is the partial penetration
of email in some organizations. Some people use it. Some don't. 
( And a place like UVA gives everyone an email address whether they 
use it or not. ) Some people don't know how to use the mail 
software. ( And especially, don't know how to turn on notification
if it hasn't been turned on by default for them. ) People don't 
understand why some messages bounce back right away, and others
take several days to be returned. In this sort of environment 
every bit of feedback helps --- It's like when a program echo's 
back "Working..." or something to keep the impatient from hitting
the interrupt. People like to get that "So far, so good" message!

I guess what I was trying to say before was: 
I agree, in their current form, receipts are any ungly kludge, and so 
I can understand if you don't want to waste your time on them, BUT we 
ARE going to need those sort of standards soon.

Which again, leads me back to the need for an "Email Architecture 
Reference Model". i.e. I don't see a proposal out there that tells 
the gateway and application people what exactly they are expected
to support. ( unless maybe it is implicit in some future promise 
of X.400 interoperability. ) 


But anyway - since the question is no longer "Why doesn't PINE 
support r-r-r?", I'll be happy to move this discussion to another
list if you have a suggestion of which is the appropriate one.

Pine was recently installed on the Unix machines in our College of Arts &
Sciences and is about to be installed on the machines in our School of
Engineering. Everyone that uses it really likes it. 

Now several departments/schools that run VMS are wondering if there is a
version of pine that will run on their VMS systems. Has anyone tried this?

There is a Windows MUA that is based (somewhat loosely now) on Pine.   It is
called ECSMail and I have included a short description of its features in this 
message.

--Part9303021223B
Content-Type: TEXT/plain; name="ANNOUNCE.TXT"

ISA has developed a new Mail User Agent (MUA) for processing electronic
mail on networks.  It is named "ECSMail".

ECSMail can function as both a "remote" MUA and a "local" MUA.   While
functioning in remote mode, it will access a remote message store using
standards based mail access protocols.   In local mode, it will access
a local message store using system dependent message store access
routines.  

ECSMail is has been designed and implemented to be as independent as
possible from operating system, display, and network protocols.  We have
achieved this by building driver libraries for the OS and displays, and
using Mark Crispin's c-client drivers for message store access (both
local and remote message stores).

Using this strategy, we are planning to support the following operating
systems, display, and mail protocol combinations:

 OS        - Unix, DOS, OS/2 v2, MacOS, NT
 Displays  - X11 (R4, R5, Openlook, Motif), MS Windows v3, Presentation
             Manager, Mac Finder
 MAP Protocols - IMAP2, P7, PP7
 MTP Protocols - SMTP, P1

It is our full intention to make this run on as many platforms, with as
many different mail application protocols as possible.  

With ECSMail we plan to provide many interesting features, such as:

  * Multi-part, multimedia mail messages:

    - supporting both MIME and X.400 message formats

    - files (e.g. binaries, images, text, voice, application) can be
      attached and sent along with the message.

    - the different parts of the messsage can be extracted
      and displayed (using the necessary application) to the user.

  * Multiple simultaneous folder access and management (drag and drop
    messages or blocks of messages between folders).

  * Hierarchical folder structures.

  * Virtual folders within folders.   Messages can be grouped using any
    combination of message header criteria into a virtual folder.
    Messages in a virtual folder can be listed and manipulated as
    a single object.   This supports threading of messages within
    folders. 

  * Integration of multicast (mail) and broadcast (NEWS, BBS) message
    stores via into a single interface.  NEWS groups appear as a list of
    folders and threading of broadcast messages will be supported.

  * Privancy Enhanced Mail (PEM).   Support encryption of message parts,
    digital signatures, and digital timestamps.

  * Forms mail.  Messages can be composed inside of a forms interface
    as a special message part.   It will include form design and
    display tools.

  * Draft message support.   Users will be able to create and store
    standard draft messages, and select draft messages from both public
    and private draft message stores.

  * Integration with "mail enabled applications".  

  * Personal configuration files.

  * Asynchronous new mail notification.

  * Personal address book lookup and management. Addresses can be loaded
    manually, copied from incoming mail, or copied from an X.500 DUA
    (see next).

  * Integration with X.500 Directory Services.  The user can query local
    and network-wide address information while composing messages.
    Addresses can be copied from the Directory User Agent to the user's
    local address book. This facility will be optionally available for
    those who have the X.500 Directory Service capability.

What Is Available Now
---------------------

A BETA demonstration version of the Microsoft Windows version of ECSMail is
available via anonymous ftp from

  ftp.srv.ualberta.ca

in the directory

  /pub/networking/win/mail/ecs.tar.Z

This version of ECSMail only supports the TCP/IP based mail access and
transport protocols (IMAP2, SMTP), and can deliver MIME format messages.
It provides what we term "basic functionality" - it does the things that
most mailers do.   Features such as the virtual folders, and NEWS
message sources have not been implemented at this time.

We encourage you to get the software and try it out.  This version of
ecs is released for demonstration purposes only - IT IS NOT CURRENTLY IN
THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.  As I have mentioned earlier, we are not currently
charging for the product, and are in the process of evaluating different
forms of funding for the software.

There are some restrictions on what you can do with the software at this
time.   The mailer is designed to support several different TCP/IP
stacks through the use of Windows DLLs.   Currently we support the
following TCP/IP stacks:

  * Beame and Whiteside - BWTCP 2.x
  * Sun Microsystems - PCNFS 4.x
  * DEC Pathworks v

We are currently working on providing:

  * Microsoft WinSock DLL compliance
  * FTP Software - PCTCP 2.04

If you are interested in supporting another TCP/IP stack, then provide
us with a copy of the stack and development kit - it must have a sockets
API - and we'll try to provide a DLL interface for it.  

How will we fund ECSMail?
-------------------------

There are two funding methods for ECSMail - maintenance contracts and
development contracts.

Maintenance contracts are signed with organizations that want support
and software maintenance on the ECSMail software.   This will include
free software upgrades and immediate response to software problems.

The cost of the maintenance is designed to be far less than
purchase->upgrade cost of conventional shrinkwrapped software.  The cost
is based on the number of installations that are in place.  The
organization will never be charged more than an agreed upon maximum.  As
the number of installations increases, the per seat cost decreases such
that maximum is never exceeded.  An organization can install as many
copies of ECSMail as they like.

Development contracts are signed to produce new functionality in the
ECSMail product.   ISA has identified a number of potential
functionality improvements that it would like to make to ECSMail.
We also believe that clients will have a number of features that they
would like to see added to the product.

The cost of the contract is determined by the amount of work required to
complete the development, and the number of organizations contributing
to the development.   The more organizations that contribute, the lower
the cost.   ISA publishes a detailed list of feature development
projects that it plans to run in the ecs-info mailing list (see below).  

Mailing lists
-------------

There is an ecs mailing list.   To join the mailing list send a message
to

  ecs-info-request@edm.isac.ca

To submit messages to the mailing list, send mail to

  ecs-info@edm.isac.ca

If there are problems with the list, then send mail to

  owner-ecs-info@edm.isac.ca

I have been consistently getting a core dump when attempting to message

pressing the return key when that entry in the INDEX is highlighted.  I can
read messages before or after it without problem, however. (This has
happened once before some time ago.)

I can read the message by using the native unix mail program.  We are using
version 3.05 of PINE running under Ultrix.  Any ideas?

Thanks!

	But that doesn't make it true or even believable.  Even with
read-receipt I can never prove you read it.  But this is an issue for
"misc.legal", not here.

	Email has become a common communications tool that people use
every day like, phone, fax, or real mail.  It is also become
increasingly reliable.  Pretendeding it isn't or worse deliberately
working to to keep it from becoming more reliable is silly.  I agree,
the issue of read-receipt is a hairy philosophical one.  But the issue
of "Did sending this message work?" is not.

	Back to the issue at hand.  Many of my Pine users know what
"Return-Receipt-To:" does and would like not to have to switch to
another MUA when they want to use it.  Therefor I would like to see
it, or user definable headers, in the next release of Pine.

I (personally) don't often use "Return-Receipt-To:", but two of the
"missing" features that most often send ME to use another mailer are
user-defined headers ( or being able to edit-headers ) and mush's 
'pick' command. ( Except I would rather that 'pick' changed the view
of the current folder - like sort, but it would temporarily drop 
messages. The mush action of outputing a msg-list wouldn't fit very
well into the Pine User Interface. )

User-defined headers have been mentioned before as being difficult 
to parse and verify. And PINE wants to support the idea of making 
the mail-headers "fool-proof" (i.e. protected).

How about adding a list of allowable additional headers and a 
minimal maybe a minimal grammar to specify that some headers 
contain addresses, and SHOULD be parsed, and others contain a 
vanilla string ( and should just be checked for non string chars. ) 

If the field definition said something like: 

Sender: <address>  "default address" 
Return-Receipt-To: <address>
X-Something <string>

Then Sender and R-R-To: are parsed/checked to ensure they are valid 
conforming fully qualified addresses ( and checked against the address
book on the way. ) while X-Something is only checked that it doesn't 
have any funny embedded chars. 


( BTW: My typical use for editing or extending headers is to 
  modify the Sender:, From:, & Reply-To: fields when sending out
  something in my Bosses name. The secretaries here would have the
  same need, but they aren't as adept with the mail software to 
  figure out how to do it, so it would be nice if there was a 
  "form" capability to set up the proper RFC-822 recommended 
  headers for this type of situation.  Extract from the appropriate
  portion of RFC822 included for illustration. )

     Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages


     A.2.  ORIGINATOR ITEMS

     A.2.1.  Author-sent

             George Jones logs into his host  as  "Jones".   He  sends
        mail himself.

            From:  Jones@Group.Org

        or

            From:  George Jones <Jones@Group.Org>

     A.2.2.  Secretary-sent

             George Jones logs in as Jones on his  host.   His  secre-
        tary,  who logs in as Secy sends mail for him.  Replies to the
        mail should go to George.

            From:    George Jones <Jones@Group>
            Sender:  Secy@Other-Group

     A.2.3.  Secretary-sent, for user of shared directory

             George Jones' secretary sends mail  for  George.  Replies
        should go to George.

            From:     George Jones<Shared@Group.Org>
            Sender:   Secy@Other-Group

        Note that there need not be a space between  "Jones"  and  the
        "<",  but  adding a space enhances readability (as is the case
        in other examples.

     A.2.4.  Committee activity, with one author

             George is a member of a committee.  He wishes to have any
        replies to his message go to all committee members.

                                     Doe@Somewhere-Else;

        Note  that  if  George  had  not  included  himself   in   the
        enumeration  of  The  Committee,  he  would not have gotten an
        implicit reply; the presence of the  "Reply-to"  field  SUPER-
        SEDES the sending of a reply to the person named in the "From"
        field.

     A.2.5.  Secretary acting as full agent of author

             George Jones asks his secretary  (Secy@Host)  to  send  a
        message for him in his capacity as Group.  He wants his secre-
        tary to handle all replies.

            From:     George Jones <Group@Host>
            Sender:   Secy@Host
            Reply-To: Secy@Host

     A.2.6.  Agent for user without online mailbox

             A friend  of  George's,  Sarah,  is  visiting.   George's
        secretary  sends  some  mail to a friend of Sarah in computer-
        land.  Replies should go to George, whose mailbox is Jones  at
        Registry.

            Sender:   Secy-Name <Secy@Registry>
            Reply-To: Jones@Registry.

     A.2.7.  Agent for member of a committee

             George's secretary sends out a message which was authored
        jointly by all the members of a committee.  Note that the name
        of the committee cannot be specified, since <group> names  are
        not permitted in the From field.

Nope.  Pine doesn't run on VMS.  Many have asked about it and a few
have contemplated porting it, but nobody (that I know of) is doing a
complete port.  If you're interested in trying, we can provide full
source code and try to help out as questions arise.

I am using two different printers according to the type of doc to print:
  desk printer for small doc
  Printer server for double side printing ....

What is the easiest way to change from one printer to the other?

Right now, I quit pine, edit .pinerc, modify the printer value and
enter pine again and print. Is there an easier way?

I thought there was the ability to grab a shell in pico.  I briefly
looked, but could not find it.

Hello Ralph,

> well as disabling ctrl-z).

Didn't know there was a shell escape(?).. You can disable ^Z in both by
not giving the -z flag. That is the default is disabled.

> 
> 2.  How do I disable pine's ability to read news folders/spool?

You've have to recompile, commenting out the mail_link(newsdriver); line
in pine.c. (Not sure I got the exact line of the file, but it's close).


> 3.  How do I supress the "612 Megabytes over limit" message seen

You can recompile with quotas turned off, but this sounds like a bug. 
I believe there's a USE_QUOTAS define somewhere in the .h files that you
can remove. What system is this for?

We had a similar problem under Ultrix 4.2 on a DECstation.  When Pine was
recompiled *without* optimization, the problem disappeared.

On the Other menu off the main screen there's an item to set the printer. When
you change it there it rewrites the .pinerc file.

I've just discovered that if I use the lock keyboard option, pine will not
accept my correct password to unlock the keyboard, and I have to break my
connection to force myself off the system.

I'm also having a similar problem with the imapd in the pine distribution.
It will not take a correct password, either.  I've telnet-ed to the imap
port and tried entering the command by hand, but it responds with bad
username or password.

My system is a DECstation 5000/25 running ULTRIX V4.2A.  I'm also running
at ENHANCED security level.  Could this be causing the problem?

That is almost certainly the problem.  Depending upon how ``secure'' your
system is, it may be impossible for an unprivileged task to verify a password.

The most common situation is that of ``shadow password files''.  This takes
the password information out of the password file and puts it in another file
that is supposed to have much stronger protection than the password file.

There are about as many different incompatible implementations of shadow
passwords as there are of UNIX.  Worse, even in the same flavor of UNIX there
are different implementations.  Some implementations are almost invisible; you
only need to relink Pine and imapd and everything will work.  Others require
code changes.  And in some of these, you simply can not win unless you have
root privileges.

All this to get around having a system call to validate passwords the way
other operating systems do...  :-(

The first thing to do in fixing the problem is to figure out what ENHANCED
security really means.  On ULTRIX 4.2A, try the following edits:

1) In c-client/makefile.ult, change the definition of LDFLAGS to be
	LDFLAGS = -lauth

2) In c-client/os_ult.h, add the line
	#include <auth.h>
   somewhere reasonable

3) In c-client/os_ult.c, in the routine server_login(), add the declaration
	struct authorization *au;
   and change the password test (the line after the comment ``validate
   password'') to be:
	if (!(au = getauthuid (pw->pw_uid)) ||
	    strcmp (au->a_password,crypt16 (pass,au->a_password)))
	  return NIL;		/* no shadow password or doesn't match */

Then rebuild.  You should get a working imapd out of this.  You may be able to
do something similar in Pine, depending upon how shadow passwords are
implemented -- as I said in some systems unprivileged processes are not
permitted to validate passwords.  imapd is alright since server_login() is
only called when imapd is not logged in (and thus is running with ID 0, giving
it root access).

I've never seen those problems on either a Sun or an IBM-RS6000, so my
guess is yes - ENHANCED security is causing the problem. 

But I have no idea what that option does and I don't have a DECstation 
to try to duplicate it.

This certainly aborts Pine, but seems to freeze the session anyway.
Could (should?) it log out too?

You'll experience the same problem with SunOS, but SUN's approach
makes it a lot easier to patch than Ultrix.

I ask because I think I'm about to ask a couple of FAQs!!

1.  When will Pine's print command work over appletalk?
	(or does it already and I'm missing something)

2.  Is there a way to delete a batch of messages, rather than one at a time?

Thanks for any info!

Any talk of putting control-key sequences in Pico (and the Pine composer)
that will take you to the top or bottom of the file, or, perhaps, to a
specific line number?

It's been on the list for a while, but finding the time and command key to
implement it is the problem!  One option (if it's "attached-to-ansi"
support you're looking for) might be the short ansiprt.c utility included
in the contrib source.  It won't solve the printing from within pico
problem, but could be used to support local printing similar to pine but
from the system command prompt. 

Hope this helps!
