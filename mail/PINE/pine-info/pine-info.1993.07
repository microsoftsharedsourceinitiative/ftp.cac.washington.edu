I believe that the decision as to whether or not pine uses the sender's
address in providing a default folder name is controlled by the
elm-style-save option in the .pinerc. Of course I'm not trying to
imply that your current problem shouldn't be looked at. I'm simply
suggesting a temporary workround for you.

This problem arises even when the default is short, if the name of the file 
you want to save in is long. I hit this problem every now and again, but 
hadn't got around to grumbling about it yet. It would be nice if something 
could be done about it (having the field scroll left/right would be one 
solution).

	I too have hit the same problem. I get away by enlarging the
	width of the pine window; something I am never proud of doing :-)
	If shell variables could be interpreted and evaluated by pine,
	I imagine this could ease the problem, where one can store long
	path names in shell variables (at least for UNIX folks of pine).

I have also encountered this problem for the first time today, except that
it was in the Address book. When specifying a long email address: 
pinkerton%foo.bar.org@very.long.address.edu  the address book allows me to
enter the address, but upon calling it up during compose, it cuts off the
end, thus ending with an invalid address. Iv worked around this by setting
aliases in my shell i.e.  alias pink='pine pinkerton%.. etc etc'  I realise
the addressing method is a mailing config problem on our side, but there
must be alot of addresses/sites that require long addresses as such.

ps. anybody know of a spellchecker for the RS6000 running AIX3.2 for pine?

Hello:

 I just upgraded to Pine v3.07 from v3.05, and am having problems with
Pine incorrectly reporting quota usage messages when it starts up. We are
Running RISC/Ultrix v4.3 and AFS. I think the AFS quota system may be
causing the erroneous messages. I would like to disable the quota feature,
can someone point me to the code that would only disable this feature
in Pine.

 Thanks 

 Cary

I've noticed from looking at the full headers of messages in my sent-mail
folder that Pine (3.05) occasionally puts in Sender: and Reply-To:
headers, in addition to the From: header, all three with the same data, my
name and e-mail address.  What criteria is it using to decide whether or
not to include those two extra header lines?

I eliminated the line "#define USE_QUOTAS" in the file pine/os-unx.h
before building pine with "build ult". The erroneous message disappeared
after that.

Mark,

I'm CC'ing the list to indicate that "pine-info-request" *should* be a
valid ID; it should go to a "majordomo" process which will either handle
the request or forward it to Sheryl Erez for manual processing. 

However "pine-request" is not a valid ID.  (Just send to "pine" if you 
want to reach the pine team, and to "pine-bugs" to report problems.)

We'll get you off the list shortly, but could you also send me an 
instance of a bounced msg to "pine-info-request" ?  Or did it just go 
into a black hole?  (Please send to me, not the whole list.)

Have a good vacation!

-teg

Why does the new Pine not always put the inbox folder at the top as did
previous version?  Now it moves around as folders are added and deleted
and this makes it a bit harder to go back to.  Since I switch from and
to the inbox a lot, it would be nice to have it as it was.

I agree that the inbox folder should have a fixed place in the folder
display screen.  Upper left as it is in 3.05 is ideal.

I hope 'sent-mail' and 'saved-messages' will also be in the #2 and #3
positions also.  Have you given any thought to 'aligning' the names of
these two folders to (for example):
	sent-mail	saved-mail
or	sent-messages	saved-messages
... or at least giving users the option of changing -both- of these names
(via the .pinerc file).  Currently only one of these may be altered in
.pinerc (to the best of my knowledge).

while we're on the subject of folders, someone brought up the fact that if
you save a message in a folder other than what is named by the user on the
from line, and it gets saved in the current working directory as opposed to
the mail folder directory, naive users can't find what they've saved
later.

I don't know what to suggest here.  ???

This is how it was working with pine 3.05. I haven't looked at 3.07
yet regarding this action.

This is something that I noticed on our system here (Ultrix).

If a person send me mail using elm, and then I try to reply to the message
(using pine, of course), the 'To:' line turns up blank and I actually have
to ^z out and do a 'frm' to determine who the sender is and then paste in
the address (or hope they have a .signature).

Is this a bug with pine, elm, something else, or totally normal operation?

Thanks for your time.

I'm curious as to when/if the ability to post to news will be added to pine.

The reason I ask is in one of the projects I work on, I send out several
files to different people through mail and also post those same files to
different newsgroups.  If I could do it all in one shot (for example, by
adding the newsgroup names to the distribution lists), it would save me
much headaches, time and effort.

Just curious, actually.

Is there someone out there who could give me a quick mini course on mail
attachments, and particularly the degree of standardization across
commonly used mail platforms, such as pine cc:mail, Da Vinci mail, pine
(of course), elm, xms, MCIMail, PSI, other commercial mail services,
...

e-mail or a phone call would be accepted.  It would be optimal to have a
quick answer in about an hour or so.  Maybe others are also curious.

On the other hand, the ability to mail while posting is already
present in trn3.x. The posting template has a Cc: line whose
entries get emailed to.

-Mike Corrigan

     I'm curious as to when/if the ability to post to news will be added to pin
    e.
     
     The reason I ask is in one of the projects I work on, I send out several
     files to different people through mail and also post those same files to
     different newsgroups.  If I could do it all in one shot (for example, by
     adding the newsgroup names to the distribution lists), it would save me
     much headaches, time and effort.
     
     Just curious, actually.

Well, to mail an attachment use the Attchmnt: part of the header...just
put ine filename of the file you wish to attach...you may use the browser
(^T) to select the file also...There is a place to type in a comment
(between the "") at the end of the filename...pine puts them there for you...

To view an attachment, pine will tell you that there is an attachment to
view or save.  Use the 'A' command (when reading you mail) and pine will
prompt you to for which attachment and view or save...If you are using an
x-terminal and have xv (or some other graphics viewer defined in your
.pinerc) pine will automatically display GIF images.

That's it....it's really simple...I can blaze through messages with 3 to 4
meg of attachments in no time...but be careful with attachments...you can
wasily fill up a mail spool with them...it's happened here before...

As for a standard...Pine supports the MIME standard (1.0, I believe).  It
automatically encodes your attachment and sends it off with your message
and decodes attachemts sent to you whenn saved or displayed.  If an
attachment is an ASCII file in one of the standard character sets...to see
a list of those fonts...I think that they are listed in the latest
RFC...you can get it by anonymous ftp at ftp.cac.washington.edu.

Well, this wasn't within an hour, but I hope I've been helpful.

Is it too difficult to modify pine to at least accept uuencoded
attachemnts and automatically extract and decode them (with prompting)?  I
like to be "backward compatible" since I believe there will lots of other
mailers which will continue to use uuencode for a while until MIME takes
over (if ever).

Status: O
X-Status: 

Is there a simple way of exporting the message I have just sent to a file.
I know I can do it by going first to the main menu, then to the folders-
menu, then switch current folder to "sent-mail", then opening this
folder, then exporting the last entry in it, and then going back to
the main menu and then to the folders menu and switching back to
the incoming folder again.

But that seems to me a little too clumsy. Especially since the
other mail system I use, SuperKOM, gives me a copy of the last
read message on a file with just one single command, as opposed
to the 7 commands in sequence which Pine requires.

If you always want to have your outgoing messages stored in a folder other
than sent-mail then why not change the value default-fcc in your .pinerc
file? 

On the other hand if you want to selectively specify the folder for
outgoing mail then use the pseudo Header-field Fcc: which becomes visible
when you enable the "Rich-Hdr" facility.  Of course this does assume you
are in a position to make such a decision before you send the mail

Subject: Swedish character sets
Status: O
X-Status: 

Thank you for the help on Pine.

I am not sure what you need about "the Swedish character set".
There are several different computer character sets which
try to satisfy the requirements of the Swedish language.

The most important of them are
ISO 8859-1
Macintosh character set
IBM PC CP 850 or CP 837 character sets
There is also a Swedish variant of ASCII, where some
ASCII characters are replaced with national Swedish variants.

The easiest way for you to get information about the
Swedish character sets is to go to a Macintosh computer.

Cut out the portion below the dotted line below, and give it
as input to Microsoft Word on a Macintosh. Tell Word to
interpret the file as an RTF file. Then print it in
some of the most common fonts, e.g. Times, Helvetica and
New York. You will then see the Swedish characters and
the ASCII character they replace. Warning: A question
mark in the table indicates a character where I do not
know the Swedish corresponding character, I am writing this
from home and I have the full tables at work, where I
will not be until August.

Dave,

Both Pine 3.05 and 3.07 have this behavior when the configuration variable
"elm-style-save" is set on.

While being true to Elm, this practice has confused many people so it was
changed for the next (August) Pine release.

This note is to announce (finally!) general availability of the Pine port
to DOS; the first widely-available release of PC-Pine.  It's distributed
in executable form compatible with either FTP Inc's PC/TCP, Novell's LAN
WorkPlace for DOS, or a suitable packet-driver. 

PC-Pine is intended to look and feel very much like Pine on UNIX, however
enhancements in 3.84 have had some impact on the user-interface (e.g.,
print is no longer "L").  As we understand the importance of a common
interface, a source release of the next version, 3.85, is planned for
August.  It will bring the UNIX version into line with this release and
include several new ports (including DOS). 

We believe version 3.84 is reasonably stable and free of serious bugs, but
still consider it a test version.  We'll try to have any reported bugs
fixed in the upcoming source release.

How to get your very own copy...

    mkdir pine
    cd \pine

    ftp ftp.cac.washington.edu
    cd /mail
    binary
    get pcpine_n.zip      <-- Novell LWP version
or  get pcpine_f.zip      <-- FTP PC/TCP version
or  get pcpine_p.zip      <-- WATTCP/packet-driver version
    quit

    pkunzip *.zip

The packet-driver version, and in some cases the PC/TCP and LWP versions,
will need additional configuration prior to running pine.  The extra step
is described in the distribution's INSTALL.TXT file. 

Otherwise, typing "pine" after unpacking should get you started.  Pine
will prompt for and insert in its configuration file (pinerc) information
it needs to run.  However, it might be best to look at the INSTALL.TXT
file first, so you know what Pine will ask you for.  Alternatively, you
can edit (and rename) the sample pinerc file, PINERC.SAM, as appropriate. 

Lastly, PC-Pine's access to incoming mail and other remote folders is via
the Interactive Mail Access Protocol (IMAP).  To take full advantage of
the new support for remote folder collection access (e.g., folders of
previously archived messages on a UNIX host), it's necessary to install
the latest IMAPd server, also available from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
/mail directory under imap.tar.Z. 

Enjoy!

Hey, before I start with the questions, let me first compliment you guys
on your coding. Pine is great! And after installing it on a couple
different machines and not getting a single error in the process, what can
I say besides Wow!

Now then, for the questions. The department for which I work deals with
the language departments quite a lot. Right now, we support email for
faculty and students on NeXT machines running pine and imap. Our concern
right now is to allow use of 8-bit characters in email messages. That is,
instead of filtering them out or not displaying them, we'd like to set it
up so that people can just type away and have their email look as close to
the written language as possible. Can you lead me to a solution for this.
We use CUTCP on IBM PC clones and NCSA Telnet UW version on the Mac. If
this is a FAQ, I apologize, but I am not a member of this mail list (yet).
My supervisor just asked me today to get to work on this project for him.

Well, I made it seem as though I had tons of questions, but apparently I
only had one. My thanks in advance for any and all help. Please respond to
me directly, if you don't mind. If no one has compiled a list of answers
for this question, I'll be glad to post one when I sign onto the list.

Thanks,
JNL

	We are having a few problems running Pine 3.05 under Solaris 2.2
(aka SunOS 5.2), at times the inbox becomes flagged as "readonly" and in
order to resolve the problem, we delete the file:

	/tmp/.\\var\\mail\\username

	This is a temporary solution, but we're wondering if we should
install pine 3.07 or if it has something to do with Solaris.

	The second problem we encountered is that when a session is
disconnected while composing a message.  Normally pine creates the file
interrupted-mail which would contain the text of the message that was
being composed when the system was interrupted.  What happens on our
system is the interrupted-mail file is created, but it contains 0 bytes.

	Any suggestions are welcome.  Thanks in advance.

I have a user in Australia, coming into my system via Infonet's packet
switch network.  He usually connects via a direct call from in town.

He reports that the arrow keys no longer work.  His PC comms software
(ProComm) is set to VT100 emulation, and so is his account.

Any ideas what could cause this?  Any work-arounds?

BTW, I typically use Pine via ProComm from Windows with vt100 emulation.

Also, he reports an error message: "RDF DENIED", and then his connection
froze.  Is this a Pine error message?

Thanks for any help you can offer.

Pine supports the ISO-8859-x (x is a number from 1 to 9) character sets, and
does the proper MIME conversion to transmit these 8-bit characters over SMTP
which is a 7-bit stream.  Pine even supports ISO-2022-JP (Japanese), albeit
only for reading.

I am not absolutely sure, but I have empirical evidence that suggests that the
8-bit character set used on NeXTs is NOT one of the international standard
character sets but rather is some private character set used only by NeXT.
This may require some filtering, or perhaps a private version of Terminal.app
that converts to the standard character sets.

Subject: emacs/rmail (babyl) -> pine folder?
Status: O
X-Status: 


Does anyone by any wild chance have a program that can translate an
emacs/rmail (BABYL) format mail folder (RMAIL file) to a pine mail
folder? Someone here ran emacs/rmail to try it and later regretted it.
Unfortunately it's not entirely trivial (I don't think) because BABYL
format throws away the Unix "From" line (not to be confused with the
"From:" line.)

Thanks.

I'm not aware of such a program, but if some nice person would like to write a
c-client driver for babyl format I'll consider it for inclusion in future
releases of c-client (meaning that Pine will eventually support babyl format
as well).

sco --- Santa Cruz Operation UNIX
  Some work has been done on this, in particular a version of the
  c-client has been ported, though it is not included here yet. This
  will probably be in the next major release.

 
So when is the next major release?

Or better still is the SCO port ready available yet?

Thanks, Jake

it doesn't understand with a message like "Can't read that one" as opposed
to crashing out completely? A crash is about the most alarming thing that
can happen to the sort of people Pine is aimed at - data is seldom lost
but it takes quite a lot of TLC to persuade people that it doesn't matter.

I attach a message from the ECS mail list that has this effect for us.

Another instance that's come up recently is where a message from a mailing
list has a "Reply-to:" but no "From:" field. Pine copes Ok except when you
hit ^T to try to take the address; instead of "Can't - nothing to take"
(or even "Can't - don't know why") you get a crash with core dump.

Several people have been asking me about how quiet the ecs-info list
has been lately.    It has been very quiet, primarily due to the work 
being done on the ECSMail version 2.00 release.    The traffic has 
been on the ECS Alpha Testers list instead as they have been working
with the new version of ECSMail for Windows.     The number of people
on this list have been restricted for all the standard reasons.

A quick update on the status of ECSMail.    Version 2.00 has been in
alpha testing for 8 weeks now.   That is 2 weeks longer than we wanted,
but we were required to make some changes to the message display
code to support reading bulletin boards (Usenet NEWS) effectively. 
We also had some very good suggestions made concerning the address
book and compose function integration.    The combined impact on the 
user interface has delayed the release of the Beta demonstration 
version of ECSMail.

Work is proceeding on ECSMail for Macintosh and ECSMail for DOS.
Both are scheduled to enter testing at the end of July.    We are on 
target for both platforms.    We are somewhat concerned that the 
strict interface conformance requirements of the Macintosh will 
cause delays in the production release.    We have some very good
help in that area from Alex Nishri at the U of T and a few others though.

Besides being busy on the software, we have also been preparing a 
lot of documentation including:

 *  Introductory and technical information on ECSMail
 *  User manuals and guides
 *  Pricing information

I have attached a new text announcement document for ECSMail that
tells people how to get these documents and who to contact in ISA.
All formal documents concerned with ECSMail will be delivered in 
postscript format.  

Having said all this, I am leaving on a couple of weeks vacation.   I
will be back on July 12 and can be contacted then.    I recommend that
you send mail to the addresses in the attached document if you would
like information while I am gone.   

We will be releasing a beta demonstration version 2.00 of ECSMail for 
Windows on July 14!    It will be available at the locations listed in 
the attachment.    Production release of ECSMail for Windows version 
2.00 will be made on July 30.     Pricing information for the ECSMail
MUA Set can be obtained by contacting:

  ECS Sales <ecs-sales@edm.isac.ca>

More detailed information is provided in the attachment.    Cheers.

                      ECSMail Announcement
                      --------------------


ISA Corp. announces the release of the ECSMail componant of its
Enterprisewide Communication Services.

What is ECSMail?
----------------

ECSMail is an electronic mail product for building enterprise mail
systems.   It is designed from start to finish as a system for
establishing mail services througout an organization, with external
organizations and the world information system in general.   It 
does this by using a completely standards based architecture.

ECSMail is comprised of the following system components:

 ECSMail MUA Set      - a set of Mail User Agents (MUA) 
 ECSMail MTA Set      - a set of Message Transport Agents (MTA)
 ECSMail MS Set       - a set of Message Services (MS)

ECSMail provides a robust set of features, including:

  * A distributed client/server architecture that separates message
    transport, message storage, and the user interface into separate
    applications.  The applications communicate with each other using
    standards based application protocols.   Messages are moved through
    the system using protocols inside of network file systems.

  * Multi-part, multimedia mail messages supporting both the MIME and
    X.400 message formats.  Files (e.g. binaries, images, text, voice, 
    application) can be attached and sent along with a message.  Different
    parts of the messsage can be extracted and displayed (using the
    necessary application) to the user.  Messages can be constructed
    with arbitrarily complex structures.

  * Multiple message service access and management.  Message folders can
    be simultaneously accessed from any number of remote message
    services and from local disks.   Entire folders or individual
    messages can be dragged and dropped between message services and
    folders. 

  * Hierarchical folder structures.

  * Dynamic message grouping within folders.   Messages can be grouped
    and sorted using any combination of message header criteria into a
    message group.  Messages in a message group can be listed and
    manipulated as a single object.   Message group messages can be
    displayed or hidden on command by a double mouse click or menu selection.

  * Integration of mail and bulletin boards (NEWS, BBS) message services
    in a single interface.  Bulletin board message services (NEWS groups)
    appear as a list of folders and threading of broadcast messages will
    be supported.

  * Privancy Enhanced Mail (PEM).   Message attachments can be securely
    encrypted using public key encryption.   Digital signatures, and 
    digital timestamps can be attached to message attachments or to 
    the entire message.

  * Forms in mail.  Messages can be composed inside of a forms interface
    as a special message part.   ECSMail comes with a forms design and
    a builtin forms display tool.

  * Draft message support.   Users will be able to create and store
    draft messages, and select draft messages from both public and
    private draft message stores.

  * Integration with "mail enabled applications".   ECSMail supports the
    MAPI, VIM, and XAPIA interapplication communication standards.   

  * Personal configuration files.

  * Message delivery services like:
      - Asynchronous new mail notification.
      - Delivery receipts (acknowledgments).
      - Read receipts (acknowledgments).
      - Message priorities.

  * Personal address book lookup and management.  Addresses can be loaded
    manually, copied from incoming mail, or copied from a Directory User
    Agent (DUA).

  * Integration with Directory Services.  The user can query local
    and network-wide address information while composing messages.
    Addresses can be copied from the Directory User Agent (DUA) to the user's
    local address book.   This facility is provided using either X.500 
    or LDAP conformant DUAs.   The ECSDirectory products provide the
    Directory Service components necessary for the integrated DUA lookup.


The ECSMail MUA Set
-------------------

The ECSMail MUA Set is a group of client user interfaces that run on a
number of different platforms.   ECSMail MUA can function as both a "remote"
MUA and a "local" MUA.   While functioning in remote mode, it will
access a remote message service using standards based mail access
protocols.   In local mode, it will access a local message store using
operating system dependent message service access routines.  

ECSMail is has been designed and implemented to be as independent as
possible from operating system, display, and network protocols.  We have
achieved this by building driver libraries for the OS and displays, and
using Mark Crispin's c-client drivers for message service access (both
local and remote message stores).

The ECSMail MUA Set will support the following operating system,
display, and mail application protocol combinations:

 OS        - Unix,
             DOS,
             Microsoft NT,
             Microsoft Windows,
             OS/2, 
             Mac System 7, 
             OpenVMS

 Displays  - X11 (R4, R5, Motif), 
             Microsoft Windows, 
             Presentation Manager, 
             Mac Finder,
             ASCII Character

 Formats   - Internet message format (MIME, RFC822).
             X.400 (OSI) message format.

 Protocols - Internet mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, NNTP).
             X.400 (OSI) mail protocols (P1, P7, P7+).


The ECSMail MTA Set
-------------------

The ECSMail MTA Set is a group of message transport agents (MTA)
that run on a number of different "server" platforms.  The MTA set is
responsible for transporting messages between machines on the network.

The ECSMail MTA Set will support the following operating system and 
mail application protocol combinations:

 OS        - Unix, 
             Microsoft NT,
             OS/2, 
             OpenVMS

 Formats   - Internet message format (MIME, RFC822).
             X.400 (OSI) message format.

 Protocols - Internet mail protocols (SMTP, NNTP).
             X.400 (OSI) mail protocols (P1).

The MTA set is capable of translating between the Internet and X.400
message formats.   Messages can be gatewayed between X.400 mail systems
and Internet mail systems.


The ECSMail MS Set
------------------

The ECSMail MS Set is a group of message servers (MS) that run on a
number of different "server" platforms.   The MS Set is responsible for
managing messages stored on the mail server and providing access service
to the MUA.   MUA's manage remotely stored mail messages through the 
message service MS Set applications.   

The ECSMail MTA Set will support the following operating system and 
mail application protocol combinations:

 OS        - Unix, 
             Microsoft NT,
             OS/2, 
             OpenVMS

 Formats   - Internet message format (MIME, RFC822).
             X.400 (OSI) message format.

 Protocols - Internet mail protocols (IMAP).
             X.400 (OSI) mail protocols (P7, P7+).

How Do I Get The Software?
--------------------------

A demonstration version of the Microsoft Windows version of ECSMail is
available via anonymous ftp from

  ftp.srv.ualberta.ca

in the directory

  /pub/windows/utilities/ecs.tar.Z

This version of ECSMail only supports the TCP/IP based mail access and
transport protocols (IMAP2, SMTP), and can deliver MIME format messages.
It provides only "basic functionality" - it does the things that
most mailers do.   Some of the advanced features are not implemented.  
See the readme.txt file in the distribution for a complete description
of what features are implemented in the demo.

We encourage you to get the software and try it out.  This version of
ecs is released for demonstration purposes only - IT IS NOT IN THE
PUBLIC DOMAIN.  


Restrictions on the Software
----------------------------

The mailer is designed to support several different TCP/IP
stacks through the use of dynamic link libraries (DLL).    The demo
software is Microsoft Windows based and supports the WinSock DLL
interface.   The following WinSock implementations are known to work
with ECSMail MUA for Windows:

  * Beame and Whiteside - BWTCP 2.x, 3.x
  * FTP Software - PCTCP 2.2
  * Microsoft TCP/IP - (BETA)
  * Novell Lan Workplace
  * Sun Microsystems - PCNFS 4.x, 5.x
  * SuperTCP 1.1
  * NetManage Chameleon

We are currently working on providing:

  * DEC Pathworks
  * (Public Domain) University of Waterloo - WatTCP

Any compliant WinSock DLL implementation should work with ECSMail.

This sounds like some problems with the way it was ported to Solaris 2.2. 
Both the locking and disconnect handling stuff vary from machine to
machine. The locking stuff is in the c-client, in the os dependent files
there, and the disconnect handling is in pine/signals.c.

Hi Mike -

Please accept our assurances on this point:
	If Pine crashes, for any reason, it is a bug.  There is
	absolutely no intention on the part of the Pine team for
	any crash to be part of expected Pine behavior.

	Thus, asking us to change a Pine crash to ``can't display
	that message'' doesn't make much sense.  If we knew that
	a particular condition made Pine crash, we'd fix the bug
	that caused the crash.

We expect that in a few weeks there will be a major new release of Pine
that fixes a great many bugs.  Unlike 3.07, which was an interim release
of patches to 3.05, the new Pine (probably 3.85) consists of major
rewrites of large sections of the Pine and c-client code.  We hope that
this new release will be a great deal more featureful and bug-free; we've
spent over a year working on it!

Yes, that works one by one. The real problem here is that the person
ran emacs/rmail on someone else's advice I guess and immediately
decided she had no idea how to use it and didn't want to get into this
so quit. But it had already grabbed all her messages. So she won't be
able to go thru one by one, I suppose one of us could do this for her
plus or minus the privacy issue (of course we'd ask, but she may not
be thrilled and I wouldn't blame her.)

Anyhow, I guess I was just as concerned for the NEXT time this
happens, which I'll guess it inevitably will.

Thanks.

I didn't mean to nit-pick, Mark; I'm a fan! The reason for the suggestion
is that Pine retains some dignity (control?) when crashing ("Abort signal
received ....") so some sort of recovery (restart but refuse to re-open
last message mentioned in .pine-debug ?) seemed possible. 

I can see that if Pine can't tell that it crashed because of
message/header content this isn't much help, but that's always been the
cause we've seen here.

Mike -

     Usually, the crashes have been things such as false pointer calculations,
chasing null pointers, buffer overruns -- the usual stuff that creeps into C
programs no matter how careful the programmer may be.

     Pine traps various exception signals, but generally at this point it
hasn't a clue as to how it happened or what damage may have been done to its
internal data structures (this latter point is important; if a boundary
condition error caused a loop to romp through memory, you don't want Pine
doing further write to the folder based upon that clobbered data!).

     The ``abort signal received...'' is essentially a replacement for the
default behavior, which is usually something like ``segmentation violation
(core dumped)'' or ``IOT trap (core dumped)'' etc.  The only real ``dignity''
that Pine retains in this case is some sort of restoration of terminal modes,
etc; if you've ever had an emacs crash and leave your terminal in a wierd
state you'd understand what I'm talking about.

     There are a few internal consistency checks in Pine which trigger error
conditions, and there is recovery code such as you suggest.

     Anyway, our intent is to stomp out all of these bugs.  Pine 3.05 has
several known bugs which cause this; 3.07 has somewhat fewer; we think the
latest version has none.  Coming soon to an FTP server near you...

The method described works, but is tedious to type.  What I do is define
an emacs keyboard macro, e.g. 

 (fset 'rmail2bezerk
    "/tmp/mboxd")

Which stores the current message in bezerk folder "/tmp/mbox", and marks
it for deletion. 

In RMAIL mode, map the macro to a suitable key, e.g.

 (local-set-key "e" (quote rmail2bezerk))

I use "e", because "x" is redundantly mapped to "expunge", and because it
is adjacent to "d".  This makes it real easy to browse a babyl folder and
delete, or copy and delete, each message - cleanup as you convert.

I suppose something like this can be written properly in elisp with a
mode to do a whole folder, but I'm not enough of an emacs hack, and the
above was good enough for me.

Hello,
  If the arrow keys don't work you can always use ^F, ^B, ^N, ^P (emacs 
cursor motion keys) in place of ->, <-, \/,  and ^. Pine accepts the
arrow key escape sequences for most of the common terminals including at 
least two generated by vtxxx terminals.  It also doesn't depend on any 
configuration like termcap, so the problem is probably on his end or the 
network connection.  The RDF DENIED is not a Pine error message.

I tried PC-Pine Release 3.84 yesterday.  I used it as follows:

   (a) with LANWorkPlace for Dos (on a standalone PC rather than
       a Novell-networked PC),

   (b) with the existing IMAP daemon running on a Sun (i.e., the one
       that comes with Pine 3.07 rather than the new version of IMAP).

This experiment was successful: after asking for my username and password,
I was able to read my inbox from the Unix machine containing mailboxes.  It
was reasonably fast.

When PC-Pine started up the first time, it asked me for values for the 
user-id, personal-name and user-domain variables.   I supplied appropriate
values and these were stored in the \PINE\PINERC file.  These values are
used to generate the From line of a message.

Later, I changed the settings of these variables in the PINERC file.  I was then
able to send messages masquerading as someone else.  This is not desirable!
Have I got something wrong?  Is there anyway in which this can be avoided?

Unfortunately, from a PC there is no way to enforce things like user-id,
etc.  No matter what we do (short of PEM or other secure mail system) we 
will always have authentication problems with PC-pine :(

	Wouldn't it be possible to make PC-Pine ensure it had connected to the
	IMAP server & validated the user account & password that way before
	sending any mail - ie 1st time in a session the user goes to send
	a mail message, if they have not previously in that session read
	their inbox pcpine does some form of test-connect to the IMAP server
	to ensure their account details are valid?

That just makes them get a little more creative.  There are so many 
loopholes in current email *transport* mechanisms that anything you do 
on a user agent (like pine) is just window dressing.

We've got the developer's kit, but we decided to get the others working 
before we tackled yet another version.  If demand is great enough, we 
may include PC-NFS support in future releases.

This is something that I'd like to see in pine (among many other thing).

If, when adding an address, you could also toggle a Y/N .signature flag. 
The reason is that when doing administrative work on several of my mailing
lists, it becomes old to have to edit out my .sig every time (because the
server gets mad if you have error producing lines).

--

Building on that, a field in the address file allowing you to designate
one of several signatures would also be interesting.  (say one field you
edit with a number 0-9 or an N, default being 0.  You then have a seperate
file or as part of the .pinerc where you can designate each # as a
different file.)  Could be nice for companies where anything going outside
local needs to have a large disclaimer, while in house then need little or
nothing on the end.

I need to step in on this discussion before it gets too far out of hand and
too many misunderstandings arise.

The issue of authentication of outgoing mail messages is an important one, and
we treat it as such.  We consider it to be of great importance that an
authentication mechanism be trustworthy.

[On a personal note: I was once ejected from a computer system and subjected
 to disciplinary action for an act I did not commit, on the basis of falsified
 authentication data.  Although I might wish that system administrators have
 become a bit more cognizant of reality in the intervening two decades, this
 has not happened.  If anything, they're even more clueless today.]

``Trustworthy'' means that authentication must give a reasonable assurance of
accuracy.  Most of the proposed mechanisms to accomplish authentication are
feel-good kludges that are easily circumvented and break another capability.

This does not mean that we have thrown up our hands and said ``it's impossible
so forget it.''  Rather, we *will* provide an outgoing message authentication
mechanism in future releases.  This will include mailer patches so it will be
possible to distinguish between messages which have been authenticated and
non-authenticated messages.

It is important to understand that PC Pine does *NOT* introduce any new
authentication problems.  These problems have always been there, since the
beginnings of ARPAnet e-mail over 20 years ago.  It is only recently that we
all have become sensitized to this problem and the urgency of its fix.

Please be assured that a fix *will* be forthcoming.  We have been dealing with
the problem, and its consequences, for some time now and it is reaching the
point of urgency.  It is just that the fix must be an infrastructure fix, not
a PC Pine fix.

Regards,

-- Mark --

What would a pc-nfs version actually provide that the DOS version doesn't?
Do you mean it will be a Windows-API application like PC-Eudora?

I guess I was a little vague (and slightly mis-informed) on my previous 
post.

The network protocol stacks supported in the current release are PC-TCP
from FTP Software, LAN WorkPlace from Novell, and WATTCP from U. 
Waterloo.  PC-NFS from Sun will be supported *very* soon.  Other than
running on the different vendor's stacks, the versions are identical. 

Windows support is a whole different subject that we have not thoroughly 
investigated yet.  Hopefully we will have a bit better handle on the 
effort required than we had on the DOS port before we jump in with both 
feet ;^)

I am typing this with the new PC version of Pine. That's the good news!

It is giving me parse errors when loading my inbox. They occur on some
funky To: lines that I get on mail from Digital's "Easynet"

The error message looks like...

[{pima.dtcc.edu}INBOX [PARSE] Junk at end of address: @cop.dec.com (@kw)]

The actual mail in my mail file looks like...

To: mail11.;@cop.dec.com (@kw)

The way pine displays it is....

To: mail11.@pima.dtcc.edu;

Pine 3.07 doesn't give the error, but munges the line identically.

Other mail agents don't choke on it, including mailx, elm, and mush.

The sender claims she sets up a mail alias for me on their VMS mail and 
she just sends to the alias.  It always arrives without a problem.

P.S. On the authentication problem, I realize that it is easy to spoof 
mail, but we shouldn't make it TOO easy.  One should be required to login 
to the imapd server to send mail and then use that login id at least to
construct the From: line.

It is coming very soon.  I had mis-interpreted the current status of the

The first option has been decided against to keep the number of queries 
to a minimum.  Either option is valid, we just decided to go the other way.

Something related to variable signatures may be possible though.

If you put your signature in a file called ".s" or something else nice 
and short all you have to do is type four characters: ^R . s RETURN to 
have it inserted where you want.  You could have several of them too: .s1 
.s2 .s3 .... Not real fancy and automatic, but workable.

Some thoughts on PC Pine...

Many of our faculty work in two person offices with one PC. Others may 
also share PCs, like someone jumping on the secretary's PC.  I won't even 
go into the horrors of thousands of students using PCs all over campus.

With the PC port of Pine, it assumes one user to one computer. The pinerc 
file has info like full name, user name, etc...

Isn't there someway to get this information from the imap server when the 
user logs in to the INBOX? Can't you take the username used and get full
name info somehow by either using the SMTP port to do EXPN commands or
using NIS somehow?

Or, allow me as a sys admin to put a global configuration file somewhere 
and let pine query it for the additional items based on the username used 
to login. I can then store and maintain a copy on a PC file server somewhere.

Another thought, forcing file\path naming (\pine for example) is a drag 
in a school environment. I would rather be able to somehow specify where 
the configuration files and even mail folder is via an environment variable.

I am not sure about the feasibility of some of these suggestions. I just 
thought I'd throw them up for discussion.

I haven't looked into yet but perhaps one way around it for those servers
using IDA-Sendmail is to use the xaliases file to remap the From field to
what the sysadmin wants by way of the hidden_hosts and/or pseudonyms file.

Ken,
Short term, I can only think of one feature that might help:
  -you can use the -p command line option to specify alternate pinerc files
  -you could then create BAT files to hide this, e.g. joepine.bat 
   marypine.bat, etc.

Not as elegant as you (or we) would like, but a start. Long term, we will
be looking hard at the whole configuration issue. We want to be able to
have personal preferences, addressbook, etc, be stored in one place and
accessible by any version of pine running on any platform.  One
possibility is to use IMAP or its upcoming companion support protocol
(IMSP, from Carnegie Mellon) to access the config data. 

Note that there are really two issues: 1. indicating to the system who
you are (with authentication) and 2. getting the personal config info for
that individual.  Remote file access protocols (e.g. NFS or Netware) are
sometimes used to get at the config files, but we need a light-weight
solution that can be implemented easily on any machine. The
authentication problem ultimately calls for Kerberos, but we haven't had
time to address that yet.

Ken,
Mark has given the big-picture answer, but I wanted to add one point:
Tying the "From: " line to the IMAP login has several serious problems:

  1. Many people have more than one acct where they receive mail, and
     the acct names differ.  Pine has no way of knowing which, if any,
     of those login names should be used for constructing the From: line.

  2. Even with a single acct, it is *usual* but not *guaranteed* that
     your preferred outgoing username be the same as your login name.

  3. Some people who act in different *roles* need to be able to change
     From line info depending on what type of mail they are answering.

  4. The fact that you might tie the *username* to a login doesn't give
     as much security as you might hope, as usernames are not unique
     across systems.  That is, you need to worry about the "right side"
     of the "From: " address as well as the left side.

Having said that, let me reiterate Mark's point that we *are* concerned
about authentication, but we need to solve the problem at the transport
(MTA) level, rather than the user-agent (MUA) level.  Either that or
simply wait for end-to-end solutions such as PEM.

It worked like a charm, right out of the box with ONE, but major,
exception:

I can't type any 8-bit characters!  And any 8-bit chars sent in a mail
from UNIX-PINE (as ISO-8859-1) show up as "_", despite me having these
option set:

	character-set=ISO-8859-1
	feature-list=old-growth,show-all-characters

I really hope this is supposed to work in the final release, else
PC-PINE is utterly useless to us and the rest of the world that needs
8-bit charsets. The reason we have switched the UNIX users to Pine is
the support for encoding and decoding 8-bit chars without the user
having to bother. 


If it is to be implemented, will PC-PINE have map-tables to map from
the PC codetable to for example ISO-8859-n and vice verse? If so,
please implement that in UNIX-PINE as well. We need that to map
Swedish 7-bit (ISO 646-SE) to ISO-8859-1 for the users that have 7-bit
terminals (ie a '}' becomes a ISO 8859-1 "a-ring")


We would also like to see support for ISO-8859 in the HEADERS. That is
part of the MIME standard I believe.


Also, can we hope on some rudimentary mouse-support in the future?
(I bet a Windows-version is faaar away)

Is there a reason PINE doesn't recognize JPEG-files as being just JPEG

that it's a JPEG by looking at the file, "xv" and other viewers can.

PC-Pine doesn't support it either.

The "jpeg" subtype is part of the MIME standard.

	You do what you can - nowthing short of dropping SMTP altogether
	is going to stop people telnetting to ol' port 25, but if you can
	simply go into a pinerc & change your ID it lowers the skill needed
	to fake messages.

	I don't know too much about IMAP - does it support mail sending as well
	as processing mailboxes?

Subject: .signature options

This is something that I'd like to see in pine (among many other thing).

If, when adding an address, you could also toggle a Y/N .signature flag. 
The reason is that when doing administrative work on several of my mailing
lists, it becomes old to have to edit out my .sig every time (because the
server gets mad if you have error producing lines).

--

Building on that, a field in the address file allowing you to designate
one of several signatures would also be interesting.  (say one field you
edit with a number 0-9 or an N, default being 0.  You then have a seperate
file or as part of the .pinerc where you can designate each # as a
different file.)  Could be nice for companies where anything going outside
local needs to have a large disclaimer, while in house then need little or
nothing on the end.

I noticed this, too.  In a lab environment where a thousand students
use the PCs this is not viable.  It would be much better for PC-Pine
to ask the server about this info.  The server should know, and it
seems a natural extension to IMAP that the client can ask the server
what the headers should contain.  (Another possible extension is "what
other accounts should I check?" to cater for postmaster, support,
personal vs. business accounts and so on.)

	1 & 3 could be taken care of by permitting the user to specify a

	If they change this during a session, an new validation is performed.

	Specifying a 'Reply-To:' line would probably get past problem 2

It may be possible to ameliorate this somewhat, while keeping essential
functionality.  We'll discuss it within the Pine team a bit first.

No, and it won't.  There are excellent reasons why message posting should not
be in IMAP, which I will not go into here (being that this is the Pine-info
list, not the IMAP list).  The IMAP list archive on ftp.cac.washington.edu in
the file mail/imap_archive has some messages on this subject.

Arnt,
The reasons why it is not feasible or desirable to tie the config info 
(especially the username used to create From: lines) to the IMAP server 
providing the *inbox* have been mentioned in a previous message.

However, we completely agree that personal configuration info should be
obtained (or at least obtainable) from *some* server.  We just haven't gotten
to that yet, as our initial target for PC-Pine was the single-user PC case. 
Also, telling the MUA how to build outgoing messages is definitely outside
the intended scope of IMAP, but definitely within the intended scope of
IMSP... 

There are several issues that must be kept distinct:
  1. Making PC-Pine "multi-user"... that is making it aware of user 
     identity at start up so it can go find the appropriate personal 
     configuration info.  (Right now you must do this manually via the -p 
     flag, although a frontend menu or script could hide that).  
  2. Location of personal config files.  Clearly there needs to be a way
     for any Pine on any platform to get at a single instance of a user's
     config data.  (Right now you must rely on file access protocols, e.g 
     NFS for this.)
  3. Authentication of sent mail.  This is an MTA issue, but we will
     definitely be exploring ways to reduce the risks of abuse.  (Some 
     simple things might be helpful, but it is hard to justify anything
     elaborate with the "telnet xxx 25" option available.)

Regarding the "what other accounts should I check?" question:  That is 
exactly what the new "incoming-folders" variable in the PINERC is for, 
although it is general enough to use for multiple incoming folders on 
either a single host or multiple hosts.

May I suggest this ..

1. there will be a uniq config file for each use on the PC.

2. the information in the config file will be encoded with a user's
   access password to send mail from the PC.

3. if the use wanted to send mail from the PC, pine will ask the user
   for the password before and decode the config details for that user
   and then send the message out to the mail server.

This way more then one person can share a PC. But each user will
have their own ID code. Just like login to any unix system (almost).

###

On a separate issue, we are running pine on an RS6000 with AIX 3.2.3
and am wondering if it is possible to get Smail2.5 to run on it with
pine ? We have only a connection to the net via uunet using the UUCP
program. The *)(&(* sendmail.cf on this machine is a mess and I am
no expert in sendmail.cf ... so to get it to rewrite the internet
style of address to let it send over UUCP ... someone have suggested
to try Smail2.5, I have managed to get hold of the source code, but
I come to a point to figure out how AIX handle mail. AIX have this in
the /bin directory

wondering if anyone out there know how to configure Smail2.5 on AIX
with sendmail ?


(In my personal view, AIX should NOT be allowed to exist in the first place,
 but there is another story ... :(( )

This is also something that we would like to see...JPEG is the preferred
method of storing images here because they are sooo much smaller than GIFs.

Later...

Ken -

The address string
	mail11.;@cop.dec.com (@kw)
is not in compliance with RFC-822 (or to my knowledge any other e-mail
standards).

The problem is the semicolon; this is explicitly defined as a ``special'' in
RFC-822.  Consequently, it has to be quoted.  Ref: RFC-822, pp 44-47,
definitions of ``local-part'', ``atom'', ``specials''.  The string:
	"mail11.;"@cop.dec.com (@kw)
would have parsed successfully.

In order to deal with the buggy mail programs that still fail to write the
host field in the mailbox (e.g. ``To: Joe, Fred, Sally''), Pine will try to
parse an address with a missing host field.  Thus, it reads ``mail11.'', sees
a special other than an @, and assumes this is a missing host address and
substitutes the local host name.  Having now finished the address parse, it
goes further, encounters the semicolon when it was not expecting one (it is
only permitted as a group list terminator), and reports an error.

To be truly pedantic, Pine should have choked at the period.  Technically,
period is also a special, but can be used to attach multiple words (e.g.
foo.bar.zap).  However, words cannot be null, so ``mail11.'' isn't valid since
there is nothing after the period.

I have no trouble believing that mailx, elm, and mush ignore this syntax error
instead of reporting it to the user as Pine does.  That doesn't mean that
these programs do the ``right thing'', because there is no right thing in
parsing this address.

I do not believe that any useful information exists with this address.  It's
totally garbaged.  I suggest that you report it as a bug in your site's
mailer, and be thankful that Pine took the trouble to alert you to the problem
instead of ignoring it.

Don't forget OS/2, with IBM's TCP/IP package.  It may not be that
difficult either, since gcc has already been ported to OS/2.  Other large
UNIX programs, like elm, have been ported sucessfully.

As PC-PINE stands today, it depends on being connected to a network,
(and it works great that way).

When I go on business trips or on vacation, I usually download a bunch
of the most overflowing inboxes and read it and answer them on my
laptop. I've done this in a very brute way, with emacs and a (UNIX)
script that'll mail out the answer when I get back.

Pine could fit in here, using a version without any Imapd, SMTP or
network dependicies.  Turning off the ability to read remote boxes if
it is compiled without net can't be hard.

The thing(?) that would require some work would be queuing outgoing
mail in a folder ("outgoing") instead of using SMTP to send it directly.

That could be handed over to something that sent it using SMTP later
on.

Any thoughts on this?  Does anyone know of other solutions to it?

Hello,

I am sure people have asked this before, but I am still waiting for
a SCO port of pine.

Is anyone working on it?

>From the pine-ports doc

sco --- Santa Cruz Operation UNIX
  Some work has been done on this, in particular a version of the
  c-client has been ported, though it is not included here yet. This
  will probably be in the next major release.


Where is this part-port available from?


Thanks,

Jake

I have also seen that problem. It catches newbies off-guard. It doesn't
happen if there is a blank line below the one you are typing on.  I had
been meaning to say something on the list about it, but hadn't before now.

Christer -

     Offline reading and answering is a very important issue for us (we call
it ``disconnected operation'').  There is still a minor change needed to the
IMAP protocol to enable it -- a unique ID mechanism -- plus a fair amount of
programming...

     However, I can guarantee that it will happen.  It has been identified as
a MUST DO project some time ago.  It was not a target of this release (after
all, we've slipped about a year on it already and the UNIX version is still a
week or so away), but I hope that it'll be in the next release.

     Also, most of the members of the Pine team are laptop users and are thus
personally sensitized to the need.  A SLIP link can be nice, but that still
doesn't work well from airplanes!!  :-)

Regards,

-- Mark --

     I don't think this has been mentioned yet, but PC Pine *does* work on a
Mac under SoftPC.

     I installed the packet driver version PC Pine on SoftPC's simulated hard
disk along with the appropriate configuration files.  Then, having attached
the Mac's modem to SoftPC's COM1, I dialed out using PC Kermit and logged into
a SLIP server.  I then exited Kermit, and started the freeware EtherSLIP
packet driver in its place.  Finally, I ran PC Pine, and lo and behold, it
works!

     I wish I could find a packet driver that knows how to talk to the Mac's
Ethernet driver.  That might require nagging the vendors of SoftPC.

     For best performance, it should be run on a 68030 based Mac or better.
My experience on a 33MHz 68030 Mac is that it runs acceptably, although Pico
is a little bit slower than comfortable.

     I would not recommend using it on a 68000 based Mac such as a PowerBook-
100 or a Mac Plus.  Nor would I recommend PC Pine on an XT class PC.  However,
I've run Pine on both and it works like a champ, albeit slowly.  It's good for
impressing people as to just how crazy you really are...  :-)

     I don't think Pine will take the Mac world by storm.  Hopefully a ready-
for-prime-time version of Mailstrom will.  We've thought on and off about a
specific Mac port of Pine.  The good news is that THINK C makes large parts of
the porting trivial.  The bad news is that THINK C's console package isn't
powerful enough to run Pine; it simulates a ``glass TTY'' (e.g. an ADM-3) with
no cursor addressing.  So work would have to be done to build a terminal
emulator.

     It isn't clear that it's a productive use of time to port a character
based application to the Mac.  But, if you have SoftPC you can play around
with the concept.  The main difference is that a native Mac port -- if one is
ever done -- would be a lot faster.

A more realistic estimate for the Unix version is sometime in August.

We are also looking for a version of pine that would allow people
to compose and read message off-line and use the "uucp" program
to have the mail transfered to other hosts. Of course using SLIP
PPP or other method is nice, but it is not necesssary.

I am wondering if there would be a version of PC PINE in the future
that would support this in the future. (A version for the MAC would

PC PINE does run on a MAC!!!  Crank up SoftPC, connect the MAC modem to 
COM1, start packet drivers (EtherSLIP), and you are ready to roll with 
PC-pine!  A MAC/SoftPC ethernet version would be nice, but we can't find 
any packet drivers for this ...

Here's a request I have for pico.

Blocking.

I use my account (and thus pine et al) over a relatively slow 9600 baud
modem.  One of the most annoying things is when I want to delete several
lines and every time I do a ^K it will delete the line and then rewrite
the whole screen.

If there was a way to block a section and then delete all of the blocked
material, it would significantly reduce the amount of screen rewrite and
headaches.

I'd think a singly key sequence that toggled blocking on/off would do the
trick, in order to keep it simple.

Yes, you can add "old-style-reply=yes" to your .pinerc and the signature 
will come at the end.  The idea is that having the "reply" or new text 
at the top with the past references at the bottom is more readable than 
the old conventional way of doing it.

By the way, who decided this? I think the old-style reply is at least 100x
more readable than the "new" way, maily because (a) you can get the
context of the message being replied to much easier than having to flip
between the bottom and top of the message all the time, (b) it
encourages people to edit the quoted text to only leave what's important
as opposed to just leaving the whole thing at the bottom, which saves
bandwidth, and (c) if you have a message with many points you want to
respond to, it facilitates going into the middle of the message and
putting your points there, rather than collecting them all in one place
where it's sometimes hard to figure out what's being responded to.

Thank goodness they have a setting for it, or I don't think I'd be using
Pine at all.

Absolutely. Also, how do you know some new text doesn't follow the old
quoted text at the bottom?  I end up scanning the old message (bloated sig
and all) again anyway.

I'll second that.  As much as I like pine, if the old-style-reply option
goes away, I'm freeing up some disk space.

Say that received mail has a From: address like user%host@domain.
With elm-style-save=yes option, when saving the message, pine prompts
with a default savefilename 'user%host'. If you accept the default
then pine refuses to create a savefilename with a '%' sign
(although it could).

Is there some way to get around this problem ? (i.e. to have the
default savefile name be based on the From: line and be permissible
to pine)

The user who has this problem wanted pine to strip the "%host"
in addition to the @domain.

Is this feature worthy of consideration as a pine-enhancement ?

Apologies if this matter is covered in the documentation
or has been resolved on the pine-info list (looked but didn't find).

Thanks

PC-pine and the upcoming Unix pine support folder collections which are

Yeah...A VERY cool idea...I'd like to see this too, cause when I'm not in
my office, I have to dial in at 2400 or sometimes 1200 (AARGH!) baud!

Since pico is a cut-down MicroEMACS, which itself does provide this
functionality (set-mark, kill-region), presumably it was actually turned
_off_ in pico?

hi : i am having problems with the imapd server daemon on a ptx sequent
symmetry system. (v 2.0.0) i have placed the imapd executable in the
/usr/etc/ directory and added the appropriate entries to /etc/services and
/etc/inetd.conf but whenever i attempt to connect to the imapd daemon from
pine or mtest the following scenario unfolds:

- the imapd2b daemon announces itself
- the impad daemon requests a login and password which i provide

i then get the following three messages

- IMAP connection broken in reply.
- Login failed: IMAP connection broken in reply
- Too many login failures

i have tried connecting from a second ptx mainframe using pine 3.05 and
also from a pc using the pc/tcp version of pine. also when i try a 
telnet to the 143 port, imapd wakes up and announces itself but the
connection is broken once i try to enter an IMAP command manually.

Can any of the pine people or ptx people on this list provide me with some
suggestions as to how to proceed on this problem. thanks.

Bob, I encountered exactly the same problem (on ptx 1.4), but have applied
the following patch, kindly supplied by Mark (Crispin). As the saying goes
"It worked for me", and imap works with PCPine, etc. as expected.


*** imapd.c	Tue Jul 13 14:44:42 1993

+   dup2 (0,1);
    mail_link (&tenexdriver);	/* install the Tenex mail driver */
    mail_link (&bezerkdriver);	/* install the Berkeley mail driver */
    mail_link (&imapdriver);	/* install the IMAP driver */


Going on past experience (and much frustration) of porting C code to ptx,
Pine is in a class of its own. It compiled "as delivered", and has never
let me down.


Cheers,
Dave

PS  I think the "tirdwr" kludge must rate #2 to "-lseq" for ptx fixups ...

Pine-folk,
We've recently implemented disk quotas on our mail spool area in an
attempt to control the problem of users who let their mail inbox get out
of control (10MB...). Interestingly enough, we've noticed a quirk with
pine not allowing users who've reached their mail spool limit to delete
any messages from their inbox. Elm and mail will allow the messages to be
deleted, but pine won't 'expunge' them. We're running pine vsn 3.05 on a
DEC 5900 w/Ultrix 4.3. Anyone else aware of this problem/feature and it's fix?
Will an upgrade to 3.07 fix this? Thanks,

Hi Debra -

     That particular quirk isn't fixed yet, but it is on my list (= I'm the
turkey to beat up about it).

     The problem is that Pine makes a worst-case guess of how much disk space
it will need to complete a checkpoint or expunge before it will do it, and if
it cannot obtain that worst-case space it will decline to do the operation.
Pine's estimate is a bit too conservative; it multiplies the number of
messages by the size of a maximum-sized Status:/X-Status: pair of lines and
adds that to the current message size.  It makes no adjustment for messages
which may already have Status:/X-Status: lines; doing this via kludge is easy,
doing it right (safely) is hard.  Worse, it makes no adjustment in expunge for
messages which are deleted.

     The concept to fix the latter is easy; an implementation that is
guaranteed safe is much harder.  In particular, I am worried about the
scenario of what happens when the user does an expunge, but even after the
expunge she is still over quota.  [This is particularly likely to happen in
transition to quotas, such as you are doing now.]  Some systems will not
permit you to rewrite data over quota, even if the result of the rewrite is to
make you be less over quota.

     In other words, I am very worried about the prospect of leaving the user
with a damaged mail folder.  Although it's bad to force the user to seek
expert help when she is over quota, it's worse to risk destroying her mail
folder.  It's one thing to accept the risk by running Elm or mail; it's quite
another for Pine (which is advertised to be a safe ``rubber room'') to make
such decisions...

     The workaround for this problem is to be sure that the user is alerted to
the problem when she crosses her soft quota, so she doesn't reach her hard
quota.  This isn't the final word on this issue.

Disk quotas are a good thing but they are not the answer to all disk
useage problems.  I lean toward the position that they are not a good
solution to the system mailbox size problem.  The solution that I have
used is to monitor the useage on a regular basis.

In most cases the disk partition that contains the system mail spool also
has other spools in it.  Quotas will control the aggregate use of all of
these spools and not just the mailboxes.

On our Sun systems we NFS mount the mailspool.  The Sun quota suite is not
good about warning users of quota problems on NFS mounted directories.

I would not want mail to fail and be lost because of quota problems, even
for an uncooperative user who insists on keeping a very large system
mailbox.  I value e-mail service too highly to allow this kind of problem.
It is my impression that sendmail will not know about the quotas on the
system mail spool when it accepts mail from a remote site.  Such mail will
be queued in sendmail's spool directory for local delivery.  If these two
spools share the same partition then what has the quota gained you in
saved disk space?  It has just delayed the delivery of the mail at best.

Generally mailboxes grow fairly slowly so regular monitoring will allow
the manager to detect problems before they become critical.  Exceptions
are cases where a user is the subject of a "mail bombing" or does
something dumb like having a 10 Meg file mailed to them.  Those cases will
probably require intervention even in the presence of quotas.

I monitor disk useage on a partition basis ( df(1) ) daily.  The spool
partition needs to have enough free space that I can detect and deal with
problems before they create real problems.  At weekly intervals I use a
public domain program called cobwebs to list large and old mailboxes.  You
can probably write an awk script or a perl program to do the same thing. 
I have adopted a variety of methods of dealing with large mailboxes which
range from notification of the user to immediate active intervention.

Once users realize that there are limits to what is acceptable in the way
of keeping mail in the system mailbox they will tend to keep thing
reasonable.  Monitoring overall disk useage is good management so that is
not really added time spent on mail.  It doesn't take much time to scan
the list of big and old mailboxes.  I spend very little time in managing
this proble.

This is not to say that Mark shouldn't fix the things that he says he
would like to fix.  It does suggest that quotas may be a meat axe approach
to a problem that is better treated more delicately.

   Another possibility is the program mailclean.  We have just starting
using this program here at Kutztown and I am finding it works well.  You
can set a size of how large an inbox can become and run mailclean.  If
mailclean encounters an inbox that is larger than the specified size, it
will save the inbox in the /tmp (by default, which can be changed)
directory.  The user will receive a mail message indicating that their
inbox was too large and it will tell them where there inbox was saved and
how they can access it.  Then you can clean the /tmp directory as you
wish.  The "folder" created in the /tmp directory is accessible by pine. 
So far, this is working great - it keeps our inboxes to a manageable size
and still allows the user ample time to retrieve the "other inbox".

I'm composing this e-mail in pico on pine 3.07 as compiled on an SCO ODT
3.0 (well actually 2.1 beta :-) system.  At this point it still needs
testing.  I did find a problem where asking for disk space caused an exec
to fail, but haven't really looked at that yet.

Is there anybody out there who would like to help me test this (I've never
used pine before so don't know what to expect).

Pine supports international character sets to the extent that it assumes 
that if you say you are using ISO-8859-7, that that is what you are 
indeen entering.  i.e. It does not attempt to do any translation.  Most 
vt100 emulators allow you to specify an alternate keyboard mapping, so 
you can set it up to use whatever character set you want.

Hi!

I am unable to set the default editor to vi, using the entry in my

Any clues as to what I could be missing ?

You cannot set an alternate editor to be default.  You always have to use 
"^_" to get to it.  You also cannot use the alternate editor on the 
headers.  Sorry.

Is there a way to include ispell in pine/pico ? It will be very
helpful to allow use to use the "ispell" program to correct the
mispelled words before the e-mail is being sendout. Ispell is
part of the GNU program list.

Set your alternate editor to ispell.  Then ispell will be called whenever 
you press "^_".

It would be very nice, though, if Pine were to enter your alternative 
editor automatically when you moved the cursor down into the text part of 
the message from the headers. (And when you are doing "reply".) I make lots
of mistakes trying to operate with two different editors. I'm quite happy
for it to go back to the default editor when you exit your alternative
editor.

Yes, agreed exactly.  The automatic invocation to be an _option_, I
suppose.  And returning to the default editor on exit from the
alternative editor would let you review the header fields once more
before sending, and so on.

I was wondering if anyone has experienced this problem and could shed some
light on it for me.  We have some time-sensitive notes that have to go out
to a wide audience right now. Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks.

Further to the Memory fault problem stated below, I was wondering if disk
space [or rather, the lack of it] was an issue. Investigation shows the
following:  
Disk usage:   /dev/home    54%
              /dev/usr     90%  (This was at 98% at 5:00 pm yesterday)

Home directories of the accounts that couldn't send messages:
                  /home/mcmail/psych
                  /home/mcmail/spring
                  /home/mcmail/blanche
                  /home/mcmail/mailhelp

Home directory of the ONE known account that could send to a distribution
list:             /usr/people/mckay

The alias file is located in /usr/local/pine and most lists are located in
/usr/local/pine/dists. Carlene was trying to send to c-mcafee located in her
directory and the alias points there.

Is a single keystroke really that objectionable?

> Is a single keystroke really that objectionable?  

Not _objectionable_, but it is not an easy keystroke to make. You've been 
typing alphabetic things and pressing return to fill in the header; it 
would be nice to be able to go straight on without having to fiddle around 
to find ^_, which is not a key I can get at by touch-typing. I have to stop 
and look and it just feels uncomfortable. I'm clearly not the only person 
who feels this way.

... and, when replying, it is ANOTHER keystroke, after the millions of "Y"s 
you have to type to reply to everybody, include the original, use the 
"Reply-To" field, etc. I do tend to sit with my finger on "Y" when 
replying...

Don't get me wrong. I think Pine is very good. Like many people, I don't 
even bother to comment about things I think are lousy!

I think it's more a problem with confusion, as Philip Hazel remarked in
his original posting.

The natural thing to do is to start typing away madly as soon as you get
into the text area, and it's easy to forget which editor you're in.  MY
alternative editor of choice for Pine is actually MicroEMACS (our own
slightly extended version).  So pico is similar enough to feel familiar,
and I _always_ pitch into word operations, marks, &c, till I realise
that pico is beeping madly at me to stop because it's had those
particular functions removed.  So it's just a Would-Be-Nice. 

    I.

Yes. Precisely! Thank you. You have expressed it much more clearly than I
did.

What precisely do you want the behavior to be?  Would this be correct?

1. Compose/forward:  Start header editor.  When cursor down is hit from last
header line, alternate editor is entered on body of message. 

2. Reply:  Start Alternate editor on body of message. 

3. Exit alternate editor:  Start header editor.  When cursor down is hit from
last header line, alternate editor is entered on body of message.

When we were looking at making this work we looked pretty close at the way
Elm works and seriously considered it.  The main reason it was rejected was
because you can't easily edit a header line longer than the screen was wide. 
Ian's rational really makes sense and Dave's solution proposed here looks
pretty good. 

I've talked to Corey (Cc's here and not a Pine user) about this and he's
always suggested that Pine be extended to actually edit the headers with an
arbitrary editor using something something like TCL for Pine to interact with
the other editor. I've always thought it was an interesting idea, but it was
more than I was up for trying to figure out how to make work.  Corey please,
correct me if I've said something wrong.

I've tested quite a bit of pine here including using mailboxes on
another internet site and things seem to be working pretty well.

One problem I didn't think of is that we're not using mmdf on any
of our machines so I haven't had to deal with mmdf style mailboxes.
A site with a development system that could deal with that part
of the problem would be nice.

I'm very new to pine and haven't had time to study the tech notes
in detail so bear with me with these questions:
    1.  Is there a place at cac.washington.edu that we could use
        as central place to put code and binaries for ftp during
        testing?  We don't have anon-ftp set up on our systems
        here yet, and it will be at least a week before I have
        time to do this.
    2.  I don't see any way to get imapd just from the pine
        sources so I assume this requires imap-3.0, and this
        would need to take care of mmdf-style mailboxes on a
        stock SCO system.
    3.  There should be a simple way in the pine sources to take
        the mmdf mailboxes apart, but I haven't figured out where
        to look yet.  Could someone point me in the right
        direction?

I have a couple of questions also about pine usage.  It appears
that I cannot pipe output of a mail message to a program.  Is
there a way to include arbitrary headers (most important is
Reply-To:) as with the $HOME/.elm/elmheaders file?

This note is to announce a new release of the packet-driver compatible
version of PC-Pine.  This new version, 3.84a, fixes a bug in the
underlying TCP/IP library which caused, under certain circumstances,
folder opening to fail with a "IMAP connection broken in reply" error. 

This fix is the only change from 3.84, and the packet-driver compatible
version is the only one updated.  We're still busy on version 3.85 which
will include many of the enhancements and fixes that have been suggested,
as well as source. 

As always, thanks for your interest!

No.  I think if the alternate editor is made automatic, it should be an
option only.  The defaults should be the current set up since most pine
users I know prefer to use pico than say vi.  Actually I use pico for
small messages like this one and vi for much larger ones that require
fancy cut and paste, etc.  I think the current ^_ (or sometimes ^shift_ on
some vt100 emulators) is good enough and there are much more important
issues that the pine developers should be working on (such as mailcap
awareness).

We are looking into adding an option to automatically enter the alternate 
editor.  There are some tricky design issues to solve though...

pico is easily the most important reason we implemented pine here. Most of
our users couldn't use vi to save their lives.

It is intriguing to note that some of our terminals (Wyse-85's) don't send
anything to the host for the ^_ keystroke!

I initially hacked the Pine code to use ^/ instead, only to find that some
terminal emulators on our PCs wouldn't cope with this either!  In the end I
disabled the suspend facility and nabbed ^Z for the Alternate Editor keystroke.
Sigh.

Jack,

Oh yes, I think everyone has agreed about that.

Agreed again.  I added my vote to the case for automatic entry of the
alternat editor, but I certainly wouldn't disagree that many things (like
mailcap) are more deserving of the Pine developers' time.

    I.

(I'm agreeing even _though_ you're in the .au domain, and England are
 currently 279-8)

Support for mailcap is definately scheduled for pine 4.0.  Changing the 
alternate editor behavior is merely being "considered."

                         PINE ELECTRONIC MAIL

BACKGROUND

Pine is a mailer designed specifically for ease-of-use with the novice
computer user in mind. It is based on Internet mail protocols (e.g.
RFC-822, SMTP, IMAP, and MIME) and currently runs on a variety of UNIX
platforms.

The guiding principles for achieving ease-of-use in Pine were: careful
limitation of features, one-character mnemonic commands, always-present
command menus, immediate user feedback, and high tolerance for user
mistakes. It is intended that Pine can be learned by exploration rather
than reading manuals.  Feedback from the University of Washington
community and a growing number of Internet sites has been encouraging.
  
A stand-alone version of Pico, Pine's message composition editor, is also
available. It is a very simple and easy to use text editor with text
justification and a spelling checker.


FEATURES

   - Mail index showing a message summary which includes the status, 
     sender, size, date and subject of messages.
 
   - View and process mail with the following commands:  forward, reply, 
     save, export, print, delete, capture address and search.

   - Address book for saving long complex addresses and personal 
     distribution lists under a nickname. 

   - Multiple folders and folder management screen for filing messages.

   - Message composer with easy-to-use editor and spelling checker.
     The message composer also assists entering and formatting
     addresses and provides direct access to the address book.

   - Online help specific to each screen and context.

   - Supports access to remote mail repositories via the IMAP2 protocol
     defined in RFC-1176.
     
   - Support for multipart mail conforming to proposed MIME (RFC-1341)
     Internet standard. This allows attachments to mail messages such 
     as graphices (GIF, TIFF...), sounds, and other files such as spread
     sheets and binary files. 

   - Work is well underway to port Pine to MS-DOS.  (Stanford's Mailstrom is
     recommended for Macs).


AVAILABILITY

Pine and Pico, including source code, are freely available via anonymous
FTP from ftp.cac.washington.edu on the Internet. Other provisions for
distribution have not been made. From the Internet, you may try out Pine
and leave comments by telneting to "demo.cac.washington.edu" and logging
in as "pinedemo". To join the Pine mailing list for announcements send a
request to "pine-announce-request@cac.washington.edu". To join the list
which includes discussion as well as announcements send a request to
"pine-info-request@cac.washington.edu".

Pine is very portable and runs on a variety of UNIX machines including
DECstations, NeXT's, Sequents, and Suns. Pine was originally based on Elm,
but it has evolved much since, ("Pine Is No-longer Elm").

For further information send e-mail to pine@cac.washington.edu. Pine is
the work of Mike Seibel, Mark Crispin, and Laurence Lundblade at the
University of Washington Office of Computing and Communications.

PC-pine will run in a DOS window under Windows with the PC-TCP, Novell 
LWP, or WATTCP stacks.  We are also working on a Winsock version.

For PC-pine, set the news-collections variable in your PINERC file to 
point to your NNTP server (for WSU, news-collections=*{serval.net/nntp}[] 
should work).  For Unix pine, wait for version 3.85 to come out next month.

I read something somewhere about a new way to send FAXes across the
Internet, using MIME.  

WIll this be possible with PINE as the mail agent?  Does anyone know what
other software / hardware is required to create such a system?

Any information or clarifications would be appreciated.

Thanks

This would be pretty easy since faxes are typically tiff/f format.
The MIME enclosure then could be processed by a tiff->printer
routine or image viewer.

We send faxes out using our MTA to divert faxes to the fax delivery
software which renders ascii->tiff before faxing, by adding an Action:
header it will take the body of the e-mail as troff input typesetting it
before sending the fax. 

The troff solution works quite nicely either from Elm where we
can specify the Action or other user-defined headers, but I don't
know how this would be done with pine (I haven't figured out how
to get a Reply-To: header yet :-).

Subject: PC-PINE Questions: IMAPD3.0/"full login"/Winsock date?

Dear pine-info People:

We at WWU like and use Ultrix Pine and are starting to test out PC-PINE
and like what we see so far.  Some PC-PINE questions:

1) Does IMAPD 3.x need to be running for PC-PINE 3.84 remote
   folder collections to operate?

2) Will PC-PINE ever have "full login" capability?  i.e.
   login ID *and* password.  (Yes, I understand the security
   concerns.)

3) Is it possible to get an approximate target date for the 
   implemention of the Winsock version of PC-PINE?

You already have to login to the IMAP server to access your folders.  The 
assumption with PC pine is that all folders will be kept on the server.  
Actually, one of the biggest "enhancement" requests we have recieved is 
for the ability to keep passwords on the PC!

Nope.  We have a Winsock 1.1 stack available, but we have not started the 
port yet.

Subject: 2 pine/imap questions - shared folders; remote authentication

Background:

We are running pine3.07 (hacked, see below), imapd 3.0, and testing
ECSmail 1.0, in the process of converting from a home grown mail system
on a Prime.  We have a Sun 670 (thumper) as a mailbox server running imapd
with the /etc/rimapd link for remote pre-authentication.  We also have
a Sun Sparc 2 as an nntp server, running INN, and use trn as the client
news reader.  A number of other Suns and PCs access these services, and all 
the Suns run Sunos 4.1.3.

The Pine hack is to emulate "noticeboards" as we new them on the 
Prime system, which are really shared folders.  To make them 
visible to users in the normal folder menu, 2 extra entries are
displayed, <notices> and <parcels> which in reality point to
{thumper}/var/spool/mail/postnotices and {thumper}/var/spool/mail/
postparcels.  This works OK for pine, but not for ECSmail.

Question 1: We have noticed extended BBOARD functionality in imapd,
will this be used in Pine 3.85, and how?  Is it just for NNTP type
services, or can it be used like we are trying to do, pointing to
shared folders somewhere?

Question 2: Remote authentication works for some users but not others,
who seem to us to have identical configurations - same home system,
same unix groups and netgroups, same .pinerc, and all can use rlogin
and rsh OK.  We cannot pick the problem - anyone have any pointers
or procedures we could follow to try and solve this ( the same 
problem existed with imap 2 as imap 3, and with the original
unhacked pine)

Hi, Pine:

I usually have big mail list for several groups.  When I sent a mail to
one account which I used to make sure the mail got delivered, then blind
copy to several groups that have a big mail listing.  For some reason,
the entire mail disappeared.  I couldn't even find any error in mailq or
syslog.  Then I did it again with smaller groups.  It worked.  Anybody
knows why?  Does Pine have any restriction for the number of blind copy or
the number of mails?

Sounds like you're getting bit by the non-wrapping-bcc bug in pine 3.05.
Your unsuspecting sendmail is probably not even getting the chance to
write syslog. 

The good news is that this bug, among other annoyances (though not all!),
is fixed in the maintenance release, version 3.07, so you might want to
think about upgrading.  An ultrix binary of 3.07 is available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu. 

Hope this helps!

Shared folder such as you describe are also under development.  We're doing it
a bit differently, but I think that the new stuff in 3.85 will lay down a lot
of the groundwork to make noticeboards a lot easier to do.

Check their .cshrc, etc. file to make sure that no extraneous output is coming
out when an rsh is done.  Such output would confuse the rimap opening code in
c-client/imap2.c and make it conclude that it can't use rimap.  Remember,
rimap is simply an exec() of ``rsh serverhost /etc/rimapd''; the IMAP client
runs with no privileges.

We have just inherited 20 wyse50 technology terminals, and the
cursor keys do not work on those terminals. How could one
adjust pine to allow the usage of the cursor keys ?

/usr/bin/vi works fine with those wyse50 terminals. I guess that
the termcap and terminfo entries on our IBM RS6000 is correct.

Thanks for your help.

Eran,

I usually use the 'save to folder' command (not export) to save message as
a file in my home directory, then I just forward message as an attachment. 
This way the full headers will be included.

   I am writing our university's basic primer for using Pine, and will
 be incorporating some screen dumped graphics for the step-by-step

   My question therefore is a simple but important one:

    Will Pine 3.85 for Unix have the same menus and look as PC-Pine 3.85?

There's a really neat way to do this!  If you put Pine in old-growth 
mode, that is set feature-level=old-growth in your .pinerc, then when you 
forward mail you will be asked if you want to forward in MIME format.  If 
you say yes then the message will be forwarded as a MIME attachment with 
full headers. 

What's really nice is that when the message is received it is displayed 
without the full headers showing, but you can give the "h" command (also 
activated in old-growth mode) and see the full header of the included 
message. 

In the future we expect that you'll be able to reply to, forward and save 
in a folder the *forward* message itself.

Sorry to waste bandwidth with such a lame question, although my teachers always
used to say there was no such thing as a lame question, just lame answers.
(Well, it was something like that <|:-)  So here's your chance!  This question
comes from a user:

	Boy do I like this so much better!

	Is there a way I can set my keyboard to make the

I'd like to do that too!  She is using PC-NFS 4.0a and telnetting into a Sun4.
Can someone tell me how to map the ^D function to the delete key?

One way might be:
"stty erase ^Vdelete"   i.e. type control-V and then the delete key.
If that works then put that in her ".login" (for csh) or in her
.profile (for sh or ksh)

Do you know that control-D already has a purpose in Unix ? If you don't
mind losing that usage that then try
"stty erase ^V^D"   i.e. type control-V and then control-D.

Hi, Dear Pine Group:

The following is part of our interactive menu for general users to use
Pico as editor.

   ls -1F
   echo "Enter the file name you want ot edit : "
   echo "   (hit return to create a new file)   "
   set filename = $<
   pico "${filename}"

If the user type a file name to edit a existing file, it works normal.  But
if the user hit return to create a new file, the Pico brings some strange
characters to the screen.  The strange characters are different every time
to the different users.  Could anybody tell me why it happened and how to
solve the problem?   Thank you very much.

Thanks for the suggestion Mike, but I was already aware of those settings.  I
have the habit of not being explicit in my first post of a question!  The
control-D function I was speaking of is specifically how it works in the
default compose mode in Pine.  The stty settings don't seem to affect this.
Anyway, the control-D erases characters to the right of the cursor, as opposed
to both the backspace and delete keys, which erase to the left.  So what we
would like to do is use the delete key in the compose mode to erase characters
to the the right instead of the left.  Hows that?

Hi Sharon,
	I did change the program to cshell and work very good..
look..

#      <<<=====  Line 1, Column 1.
   ls -1F
   echo "Enter the file name you want ot edit : "
   echo "   (hit return to create a new file)   "
   set filename = $<
   pico $filename   <<<==  variable changed

I hope to solution you'r problem...

Oh. Hmm. What I read in the technical notes is that pine/pico does not
provide the kind of key binding reconfigurability required to do what
you are asking.

The only way it can be done is within "the terminal" i.e. by causing
the key you want to use to actually emit the character that pine/pico
expects.  You have to bind the delete key so it emits a control-D.
Only in some terminal situations is this possible. Two common situations
where I think it is possible are when using an X-terminal (keymodmap? or
something) and with MS-Kermit. Possibly NCSA telnet can rebind your
keyboard also.

If you are using PC-NFS as a telnet client then it would be up to PC-NFS
to give this ability - about which I know nothing. Telnet itself
does not normally give this ability - although it could conceivably.
Possibly somewhere in DOS.

Hi, Ernesto Isaias Callejas Mancilla:
Thank you for your solution.  It works only when the file name has no
space between.  Our users like to have long name with spaces between.  I
change my code to the following ( it is a C Shell code).  Hope it will help
somebody has the same problem.

#
                ls -1F
                echo ""
                echo "Enter the file name you want to edit : "
                echo "   (hit return to create a new file)   "
                set filename = $<
                if "${filename}" == ""  then
                   pico
                else
                   pico "${filename}"
                endif


Thank you very much.

There is a solution on the PC side that may work.  A tsr program called
newkey, I think, will remap any DOS key to any other key sequence.  It's
shareware and can be found on the Simtel archive.  If you want these keys
to function in Pico and have no other Unix applications where you want
them to function, you can run a .bat file that remaps the keys to their
Pico equivalent, establishes the Unix connection, and when the connection
ends, resets the keys to their DOS settings.  I got this program and had
it working fine with telnet connections, but the asking price of (I think)
$25 per PC was too steep for our budget, so we dropped the idea. 
Basically, you made a little file containing English-like commands telling
newkey that you wanted "home" remapped to "cntrla", which meant that when
you were in pico, home went to the beginning of the line.  Unlike other
remapping programs, it's independent of your comm program.  As far as your
comm program knows, you really just hit cntrl-a, not home.  With regard to
cntrl-arrow keys, these functions don't exist in pine, so there's nothing
to remap them to.

Subject: Arrow Keys and Pine ...
Date: Sat, 31 Jul 93 06:35:11 -0700



We have just inherited 20 wyse50 technology terminals, and the
cursor keys do not work on those terminals. How could one
adjust pine to allow the usage of the cursor keys ? Or adjust
the terminfo or termcap file to get the right settings. But the odd
thing is that /usr/bin/vi works fine with those wyse50 terminals with
those arrow keys. I guess the termcap and terminfo entries on our
IBM RS6000 is correct.

Thanks for your help.
