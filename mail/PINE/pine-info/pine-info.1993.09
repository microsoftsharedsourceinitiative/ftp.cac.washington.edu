The 'automatically move read messages to mbox' trick of UCB mail is
confusing for novices; without warning they suddenly have to look for mail
in two places. Even if Pine implemented an 'auto save to Oldmail' on read
messages, many users would be alarmed at seeing the consequent deletions
on screen.

This is why my suggestion makes it a user-choosable option, but if offered to
users at the beginning of each month, many of them would say "yes".

Where novices keep hundreds of mesages in a heap it's usually because it
hasn't occured to them that it could be done any other way or because they
fear losing messages by mucking about. "Move Inbox to Inbox-Aug-93?" would
seem an unthreatening yet sensible suggestion to be making to these people.

We too have decided to go with pine on our Univ.
Question is the same... should we wait or use 3.07 and 3.84 (pc-pine)?

Yes, IMAP can manage mail folders.  PC-pine currently supports remote 
mail folders and Unix Pine 3.85 will also have remote folder support.  

Stay tuned for more information...

We are planning to implement a "bounce" command in a future release of 
pine.  It will not be available in 3.85, but will be there in a later 
release.

Please forgive the ignorance of these questions.  I am new user of PINE
(previously using ELM) and I have not been able to find a decent technical
reference manual anywhere. 

Here are my questions:

1) How do I prevent PINE from creating ".pine-debug*" files in my home
directory?

2) How do I prevent PINE from saving my sent-mail (limited disk space)?

3) Is there a way for PINE to automatically launch if there is mail in my
inbox (equivalent to "elm -z" command)?

4) We are using PINE 3.05.  Is this the latest version?

5) In my To and or From fields, the full name is coming in with quotation
marks around it.  How can I remove them?

6) When I Index my mail, the To field is e-mail address.  Is there a way
for me to see the person's full name (ala ELM)?

I appreciate any answers that anyway can provide.

To prevent the files from being created, remove the -DDEBUG flag from the 
pine/makefile.xxx and re-compile.  If just having them empty is enough, 
use "pine -d 0".

Quoted from a previous answer by Terry Gray:
This feature is not built into Pine, but it is trivial to simulate it
with a shell script.  For example, you could create a script called
"pinez" containing:

--------------
#!/bin/sh
if test -s /usr/spool/mail/xxx ;then pine ;else echo No mail ;fi
--------------

where "xxx" is your user name.  Then put "pinez" into your .cshrc
instead of "elm -z"

The current distribution is Pine 3.07, but Pine 3.85 should be out real soon.

The quotes are necessary because of some character(s) that are invalid in 
the fullname without quotes.

I am not sure what ELM does, but Pine provides the best information it 
can with the available information.  i.e. it will use the full name in 
the index if it is given.

I can't imagine using a system that didn't automatically file the
mail I've read out of the inbox.  When I want to review 
unread mail, I don't want the folder cluttered with messages I've already read.

The system I use now, auto files read messages into a read folder,
but also leaves them in the newmail/inbox folder until you
select a new folder or exit.

I've been using mh, now I want to use pine to organize my mail.
Is there any way to convert my old mh mail files so it goes to 
pine folder? So I can use pine to accessed it?

Speaking as a system adminstrator who's always looking for more free disk
space, it would be wonderful if Pine could deal with compressed mail
folders.  The idea is that you could have a cron job that would go around
and compress old mail folders (say those not accessed in the last week). 
Pine would have to be smart enough to recogize the folders even with the
compression suffix on the end, and then launch the uncompress program when
the user tried to open the folder.

This would result in a hit the first time you opened a folder you hadn't
used in a while, but some folders are infrequently accessed.  Consider the
'sent-mail' folders.

I once tried to look at the folder opening code to see how hard this
would be, and it looked like the main hassle would be the fact that
instead of being named 'sent-mail', the folder name might be something
like 'sent-mail.gz'.  Clearly, you'd want to show the user the 'sent-mail'
name and not the 'gz' (or 'Z') suffix.

I ran into this recently.  In the MH distribution there is a script
called packmbox.sh.  Here it is.... 

----------

#
# Context:

#
# for simplicity (and speed) we don't parse command-line args (much)
case $#/$1 in
   1/-h*) echo "syntax: packmbox [+folder] [msgs] [-help]" 1>&2; exit 0;;
esac

scan -noclear -noheader -noreverse -width 256 \

# tricky -- you must do this "cd" after scan has updated the context
cd `mhpath`

I agree this would be cool...but...

Ok...the sent mail folder...accessed EVERY time the user sends mail...not
for reading, but writing...your cron job would (or should) never compress
this one...

If pine knew (say, by hardcoding to use compress {.Z} or gzip {.gz}) which
compression method was to be used, it could filter out the .suffix...that
wouldn't be too tuff...It could keep an internal list of which folders
where compressed, etc (Ok, maybe not trivial, but not impossible)...and when
they needed to be read, a zcat or gzcat could be done and piped right into
pine without actually uncompressing the file...However, the hitch would
come when you needed to write to the file...Tacking a message onto a LARGE
folder could take a LONG time (depending on your system, I guess).

I agree (becuase I'm a sysadmin who has disk space problems, too) that
compressed mail folders would be an added bonus to what I consider the
best mail software around (besides NeXTMail, of course), however, I think
that it would probably be more trouble than it's worth from coding, system
resources, and actual processing time standpoints...

Later...

Is there thought for including a "filter" program with Pine (similar to that
which is supplied with elm), so that mail from specified sources or groups
can be automatically foldered/handled/re-directed etc?

My reason for wanting this is simple: the sheer volume of traffic
generated by the pine-info mailing list is swamping my inbox!!!!

I'll wait to see the replies to this, but then I must seriously 
consider unsubscribing to this list........ which is a shame because
it is useful :-)

Thanks 

Steve

If you're on a UNIX system, then either 'deliver' or 'procmail' should do
what you want.  I use deliver with pine to have mail automatically stuffed
into the right folders -- including mail from pine-info -- and it is very
helpful.  Ask archie for an archive site near you.

It looked to me like David's response could be misinterpreted so that you 
might think he was kidding (because of the wink).  He wasn't kidding.  
The filter program that comes with elm can certainly be used.  The 
delivery of mail into the various folders has nothing to do with the 
program you use to read the mail.  I personally use procmail to filter my 
incoming mail.  Any filter you come across may be used.

	IMHO, why not simply use the filter program supplied with elm?
The filter program is NOT only for elm.  It is generic.  As a matter of
fact...that is what I'm doing.  Using the elm filter program and composing
with pine.

	I wouldn't unsubscribe based on this small item.  While pine
is lacking in some features it is much better than elm is when including
MIME attachments.  (Read, user friendly.)

	So, just grab the filter from the elm source and use it.  


	Hope this helps...

Agreed Ed. I wasn't intending to discontine use of Pine - just maybe 
unsubscribe from the list! 

Now that I can use another filter program, I don't even have to do that....

Thanks to all who replied.

How about linking the pine-info mailing list to a newsgroup called
comp.mail.pine?  That way people can choose whether to participate
via mail or news.  Also, it'll be much easier for Pine users to
find out about the discussion group -- currently it's pretty much
just word of mouth.

I suppose this means Nancy that you'll be proposing a call for 
votes etc etc for comp.mail.pine, generating discussion in 
news.groups etc etc :-)

It might be simpler to echo to bit.listserv.pine-info -- but in any case,
a Usenet group would be great!

How are these "mail-filter" programs used?
Does it involve the .forward file?
Can I use a mail-filter and the 'vacation' program at the same time?
Can I use a shell script as a mail-filter/redirector?
Where can I find information on use of the .forward file?  -mr

Other contributors to this discussion have missed a point: PC-PINE users
ONLY have the customisation provided by PINE, and cannot trigger features 
of the MTA instead (this comment also applies to the discussion on 
filtering).
In our case, we cannot use the currently provided features to produce the 
proper reply address since while we can get the domain right, we cannot 
put in a friendly name (eg, I want to have barry.landy@whatever).

No Barry, I think you're missing a point of functionality.  If the MTA is
not doing the "friendly name", then how the heck is it supposed to handle
it when it comes back (say, in a reply)?!  Don't worry - it's a common
mistake to try to move MTA functionality into the MUA.

Rewriting of user addresses is definitely a job for the MTA.  It may be
true that the MTA needs a better interface to the administration of this
functionality, but that can hardly be blamed on PINE...

Filtering and automated routing of certain messages to certain
mailboxes/maildrops, on the other hand, might fit nicely into a doitall
MUA like PINE.

Most archivers have an option to quickly add a new file to an existing
archive without having to decompress and recompress the whole
archive.  So if you were willing to reconsolidate the files
in an achive back into one file when you want to read it,
you should be able to add a message to a compressed archive without
a huge overhead.

One approach would be to keep every message as a separate file
in the archive.  Then you could retrieve or add a single message
with only the overhead for compressing/decompressing one message.

If you receive your mail on a system where the Mail Transfer Agent is
sendmail, then the .forward file is the typical place where you would
place the mail-filter program.  You can feed the incoming messages to any
program you want.  It could be a shell script that does multiple things. 
The .forward file can also have more than one address, so you could give
the vacation program as one address and a filter as another.  (I hardly
ever use vacation programs because of their tendency to send embarrassing
vacation announcements to mailing lists that don't care, though modern
vacation programs are fairly safe.)

I can't remember where you can read about the .forward file.  Probably in
the Sendmail Installation and Operations Guide.  Here is my .forward file
as an example.  There are two "addresses" separated by a comma.  You can
also put them on two separate lines, but some sendmails have trouble with
that in rare cases.  Each of these "addresses" is actually a shell script
invocation.  Quotes around the whole thing (because there are embedded
spaces), a pipe character at the start (to tell sendmail this is a program
instead of an address), and then the shell script.  Sendmail will call
each script with the message as standard input.  The programs will be run
under your UID. Procmail is available on the net and this is just the way
he suggests calling it.  The #hubert is there to distinguish it from other
user's procmail calls, so that your mail won't be eliminated as a
duplicate by some sendmails.  A simple procmail will usually look at the
From's and To's and maybe the Subject lines and filter messages into
different mailboxes based on those.  The other "address" is just a simple
script.  Note that I could throw in a comma followed by hubert on the end
if I wanted a regular delivery to go to me, similar to the way it is shown
in the vacation manual page (note that that backslash they show in the
vacation man page isn't actually necessary or useful).

In Pine 3.05, the name "inbox" is not always interpreted as THE inbox...
You can, however, save to the full pathname, e.g. /usr/spool/mail/gray,
moreover, if you create a link such as:
   cd ~/mail
   ln -s /usr/spool/mail/gray inbox
things should work as you'd expect.

You can probably find the missing messages by doing a G(oto) ~/inbox RET.

In 3.85, saving to "inbox" should uniformly mean THE inbox, in all name 
contexts, so you won't need the link to get the expected behavior.

However, it is usually trivial to arrange for MTAs to interpret friendly 
names on input -- e.g. in Unix you set up a suitable alias file, but on the 
other hand many MTAs do not provide straightforward ways of re-writing 
headers on outgoing mail. Furthermore, consider a system with a main mailer 
machine and lots of user workstations. The main machine can be set up to 
receive mail for  "Philip.Hazel@central.something"   and deliver it to 
"ph10@my.local.workstation". However, the workstations themselves may well 
just emit SMTP mail to anywhere. Therefore, it is in the workstations that 
you have to do header re-writing. It is much easier if the individual users 
can simply tailor their MUAs to do this job; otherwise there is a big
workload on some poor system administrator, which is also the case if you 
insist that all outgoing mail go through a central machine.

Again, you miss a point (and I think that the underlying message is that
the mail world is a good deal more complicated than appears at first sight!).
The friendly name I wish to specify is on the domain I am specifying, but this
is NOT the system on which the IMAP PINE is accessing resides.
We have a mail hub/switch system (identified by the domain) which takes a
mailid, and redirects to a different domain and userid; eg
barry.landy@ucs.cam.ac.uk is redirected to bl10@cus.cam.ac.uk
cus.cam.ac.uk is the unix system I am calling with PINE.
Now, I dont want my PINE users (or myself for that matter) to have to get into
any arcane actions on the unix system; the whole point is that they are PC users
for whom a unix based mailer is being made available in a PC like manner.

Subject: Pine and PMDF cannot talk quoted printable to each other

A friend of mine, who uses an Mail Transfer Agent called PMDF,
recently sent mail to me which purported to be in MIME format.
Pine, however, claimed that the format was illegal quoted-
printable and refused to show the text to me.

Two comments on this:

(a) Which is wrong? Pine or PMDF? The one which is not
correct should be corrected.

(b) It would be better if Pine showed the text to me, 
even if Pine thought it was illegal MIME syntax. Quoted
Printable, after all, is meant to be somewhat readable
also to those who do not have fancy character sets.

[This is adding to the above, not replying to it.]

Furthermore, in this example, it is NOT appropriate to configure the
cus.cam.ac.uk system to accept mail addressed to ucs.cam.ac.uk, since not
all users of cus.cam.ac.uk have that as their domain address. Different 
groups of users who have their final mailboxes on cus.cam.ac.uk may well 
have different "friendly" mail addresses, e.g. 

  john.doe@some-college.cam.ac.uk
  jill.person@some-department.cam.ac.uk 
  
which are handled via the mail hub/switch. There are thousands of users of 
this system. Apart from the fact that the MTA on cus.cam.ac.uk (smail3) 
doesn't have a re-writing facility, the sheer administrative effort of 
maintaining lists of per-user friendly mail addresses so that each outgoing 
message could have its headers re-written is too great. Much easier to let 
each user tailor their own world.

The solution to this, of course, would be an unsubscribe command in
Pine, which would automatically cause the user to unsubscribe from
a list. And also of course, a subscribe command.

Such commands, however, requires a standard for how to subscribe
and unsubscribe to lists. Some people in RARE are working on such
a standard.

Without sample data and information such as the Pine version number, it's
impossible to figure out what the problem was.  I'll defer to other members of
the Pine team to answer your request about displaying the text without
decoding.

I've finished cleaning up the pine port to ISC 3.0, but I find that it
gets bus errors in places that make no sense.  Being as how I've had
numerous panics due to faulty hardware, I have to make the assumption 
that certain system files were damaged, and are causing problems for 
numerous programs.  (Seems like programs which use various tcp/ip calls.)  

Being as how I'm not ready to go through the restore process and won't be 
for quite some time, I thought maybe someone out there might want to give 
my port of pine a shot on their machine.  We can start with a binary and 
see how that goes.  Any volunteers?

Thanks!

(in the G-WHIZZ section of the show). The mailer and editor used? Our
heroes--PICO and PINE.
Also featured was gopher (terminal window version).

We have had problems with using pine and pico in hpterm windows (with HP's

cursor-moving keys are not being understood.  Does anyone have fixes for
this?

A patch will be included in the Pine 3.85 distribution, in the 
contrib/keypad-enable directory, that will enable the HPterm cursor keys 
as well as the application keypad.  The reason it will only be a patch is 
that we do not currently support the application keypad, only the cursor 
keys.

No, but this is a problem for us, too.  Probably everybody that has an

By the way, HP-UX also comes with xterm which works fine with Pine.

I'm aware of this...I use it extensively...However...the console on an
HP9000/430 and any other HP 9000 that has X capability (the consoles) act
just like an hpterm window (its what hpterm is based on)...this poses a
problem if you need to use pine and you're trying to fix X, or do not have
XDM enable on the console (or don't want to bring up a full xsession just
to do a quick mail check)

Anyway...just putting in my 3.2 cents (tax in Washington :-) )

Later...

Seeing as how I didn't receive a single volunteer to test Pine 3.84x yet, 
I have to assume there is no interest in using Pine/Pico under ISC.  
Therefore, I will cease all work on it and may pick it up again in 6 months 
or so if I feel like it.

Has anyone other than me been unsucessful in entering an X400 gateway
address to the addressbook?

I have a person that need added to a distribution list, but I cannot
because his X400 address is too long for Pine. 

Also...even though I have all of my address book entries sorted properly
in the list (Last Name, First Name) when I prepare a distribution list made
up of other aliases, it sorts them alphabetically based on their FIRST name.
Any ideas here?  I am using version 3.05. 

I would test a new version, but I also don't know what ISC is.

Hey, and while I have already cluttered everyone's mailbox with this
message, anyone know where I can get a simple yet effective mnailing list
reflector package. (Respond via E-Mail to keep Pine traffic down, please).

ISC stands for Interactive Systems Corporation, and that is the
brand of Unix to which I have attempted to port Pine and friends.
I would guess that if you were running it, you'd know it.  Thanks
for the thought though!  (For the record, pico seems to work just
fine.)

L.S.

I did once with a "echo .... >> .addressbook" but my volatile mind has lost.
However, i just have tried a tempoary-file construction and it works as well:

Edit a file (vi x400.tmp) and enter the required string:
Nick-Name<Tab>Full Name<Tab>"A=aa aaa/B=bb bbb/C=et cetera/"@400net.Country

Finally append this file to the .addressbook (cat x400.tmp >> .addressbook)

There are good reasons for maintaining a central MTA with a re-writing
capability. I feel that Philip Hazel's reply dismisses these to lightly. 

Unlike Cambridge this University has a single, central, mail hub serving
all mail enabled Unix and Novell/PC systems on campus. It serves many
hundreds of systems and many thousands of users and does per-user
resignature as this message shows.

One advantage of a central mail hub is that it can provide additional
gateways for e-mail, such as TELEX and FAX for example, that individual
departments/users cannot afford to install themselves. Moreover system
administrators are freed from the tiresome and difficult task of
maintaining complex mail configuration files, tables, etc. Any mail
originating on a client is simply forwarded to the central mail hub which
does all the work of re-signature, routing, list expansion, etc. Likewise,
addresses on incoming mail are processed to determine the appropriate
delivery mail box and system. In certain cases the message is forwarded to
another destination. 

The central mail agent is sendmail with the IDA enhancements. The latter
is the key to being able to re-write header and envelope addresses in
incoming and outgoing mail. 

The main benefit to users is host hiding; users can and do move around and
although their mailbox system may change their e-mail address does not.
Their are secondary benefits such as "friendly" mail names, central
aliasing and automatic re-direction of mail at the mail hub. 

The administration of e-mail addresses is simply a component of the
centralised user registration system that our Computing Service maintains.
The majority of our users (undergraduate) are automatically set up
with a Unix username and a mail name derived from info passed to us from
the Registrar's department at the start of each academic year. Staff users
are added by hand when they register with the Computing Service.

Neither Philip nor myself would deny your good reasons, nor do we dismiss 
them lightly. We are only trying to point out that there are multiple 
ways to skin this particular cat, and for the way that we have gone (for 
good local reasons) we need "Reply-To".

I suggested creating a dummy account with a .forward in it listing all
the usernames, but that seems like a backward way of doing it.. any
other solutions in pine?

Hi,

I apologize if this has been asked and answered, but I just got back from
a three-week vacation to 1300 new mail messages, so I didn't really ready
everying very closely.

Anyways, is the new version (3.85 wasn't it?) out yet?  If not, what's the
time line?  When I left, it was 'Real Soon Now{tm}'.

Thanks much.

Hmm, any chance we could possibly maybe see a list of changes and
enhancements the new version will bring?  Just to make us all drool a
little bit more, of course.

(Of couse, if documentation is the last thing you are working on, I
suppose this doesn't exist yet :-)

This is from the PC-pine 3.84 release notes.  We have not reviewed it for 
Pine 3.85 yet, but it should give you an idea...

			********PRELIMINARY********

II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                    Page

- This is the first version of Pine that runs on DOS.

- It has several major new features:
   o Multiple folder collections.
   o Remote folder create/append (requires new IMAPd).
   o Composer has Mark command for block cut/paste.
   o Improved handling of text attachments.
   o Improved mailbox lock handling: latest Pine will now be read-write.
   o Messages directly to you marked with "+" in Folder Index.
   o Several new .pinerc options.
   o Various UI improvements (command consistency, simplification, etc).
   o Easier access to newsgroups (but still not a full newsreader).

- Several command key changes were needed to allow for new features:     Page
   o Print is now "Y" instead of "L"
   o The Folder List is now uniformly accessible via "L"
   o Viewing/saving attachments is now done via "V" instead of "A"
   o SortIndex is now "$" instead of "Z"

- There are several known limitations in the PC version:
   o There is no spelling checker.
   o Sorting the Index (by other than Arrival) is *hopelessly* slow.
   o The alternate editor function is not available.
   o Versions: initially only packet driver, Novell LWP, and FTP PC-TCP
   o Memory: it needs about 500K out of 640K.
   o Probably can't run image viewer from within Pine, due to memory.
   o Performance optimization still needs to be done.

No, please do not permit that. In general it would mean that someone
outside your mail domain receiving such a message and attempting to reply
to all the Cc: list would generate incorrect addresses for them; indeed, if
you used nicknames/aliases he would not know who to reply to at all.

Wonderful news - especially as we are relying (as are many others) on having
this in production for the new academic year now fast approaching.
It would be very important for me to know what bugs are fixed (in PC-PINE),
especially the 'black screen' effect I reported when doing compose in the "-k"
version for PC.
We would also very much like to know when you expect Unix Pine to catch up with
PC PINE.
These two in particular have major implications for our documentation, courses
etc etc.

Thanks for all the hard work; you guys must be really sweating!

We are still working out the details for standard setups, and have come
across an apparent glitch.  I believe I have gone through the whole
technical notes document twice (at least 8') What happens is when I attach
a data file and mail it back to myself, I seem to get the encoded file but
cannot detach it once received.  When I check for attachments, I am
asked...

Enter attachment number to view or save (1 - 1)

There has been times when the attached file is seemingly not included, and
the file bombed.  When this happened, I believe there was an attachment
but it was empty.  Specifically, I am trying to send WordPerfect files
created in DOS and then copied up to my Unix disk via NFS.  It works great
with ascii files.

I've attached a portion of the message below.

One more question:  Will there be block editing capabilities in future
versions of pico/pine?

	We also are having trouble with attachments. When a pine mail
message with attachments (a wordperfect file as noted by Elmar Kurgpold)
is sent to an OpenWindows 3.0 mail tool (SUN based X-11 system), the
attachment is not recognized. The attachment exists as part of the body of
the message not an attachment.

Hi all,

Just a warning about the use of long addressbook lists - they cause Pine 
to crash. I'm not sure whether it's simply the number of entries, or what.

I have a reasonably long addressbook, with a number of levels of
'indirection'. For example, my research section is made up of
3 research groups, each which are split over 2 physical sites 
(separated by ~1100 kms). 

So, when I want to mail all members of the research section, my addressbook
entry looks like:

Section		Whole Research Section		(Group1, Group2, Group3)
Group1		First Group			(Group1Site1,Group1Site2)
Group2		Second Group			(Group2Site1,Group2Site2)
Group3		Third-and-Final Group		(Group3Site1,Group3Site2)
Group1Site1	First Group Site 1		(name1,name2,name3,name4)
Group1Site2	First Group Site 2		(name5,name6,name7,name8)

Does long translate to more than 10 lines, more than ten screens, or more
than 10 thousand?

   I reported the same problem using 3.05a and 3.07 running aix 3.2.x
but have not had the time to try and chase it down.   Is this problem
unique to the rs6ks running pine?

	I don't know if this is the same problem.  I'm getting an error

everyone on the list.  I have 34 recipients on this list.  The hardware is

Below is a partial output from .pine-debug* after I sent a message to test
a couple of problems I am having.  This mail was sent to a distribution list
and my first question is why are these names being listed alphabetically by
their FIRST names.  

This is an excerpt from my .addressbook which shows the entries in question.

Christy	Allison, Christy	piranha@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu
Sarah	Butcher, Sarah		butcher95@alison.sbc.edu
Board	District Board		(Christy,I,Sarah)
I	Wolff, Jeffrey M.	jwolff@nyx.cs.du.edu

As you can see, the aliases are entered in last name, first name format so
that they sort alphabetically on their last name in the list.  That works 
fine, but in the distribution list they sort on the first name. 

The second question is my full name.  As you can see, it shows up on mail
as "Jeffrey M. Wolff".  How do I get rid of the quotation marks?  When I 
originally configured the .pinerc in my home dir, I put my name in
quotation marks on the fullname= line.  But then I realized I don't need
the quotation and I removed them.  PINE still puts them in.  I have even
tried deleting my .pinerc and reconfiguring but with the same results.

Can anyone help on these issues?

You most certainly DO need quotes around your chosen comment - because it
contains a period (".").  Periods (and other special characters) may not be in
unquoted comments in addresses.  

Alternatively, if you remove the "." after the "M", PINE will probably
stop putting quotes around your comment...

Someone else will have to answer your sorting problem, but in answer to why
your name is in quotes, any name that has a period in it has to be quoted.
That's the RFC 822 rules.  Spell out your middle name, remove the period after
the M, or get rid of it entirely; do any of these and the quotes will
magically vanish.

Well, for some reason, my whole email message didn't get posted. Here it
is again:


Just a warning about the use of long addressbook lists - they cause Pine 
to crash. I'm not sure whether it's simply the number of entries, or what.

I have a reasonably long addressbook, with a number of levels of
'indirection'. For example, my research section is made up of
3 research groups, each which are split over 2 physical sites 
(separated by ~1100 kms). 

So, when I want to mail all members of the research section, my addressbook
entry looks like:

Section		Whole Research Section		(Group1, Group2, Group3)
Group1		First Group			(Group1Site1,Group1Site2)
Group2		Second Group			(Group2Site1,Group2Site2)
Group3		Third-and-Final Group		(Group3Site1,Group3Site2)
Group1Site1	First Group Site 1		(name1,name2,name3,name4)
Group1Site2	First Group Site 2		(name5,name6,name7,name8)

This is getting *ridiculous*! 

I've now attempted to send this full message 3 times to the pine-info 
mailing list (about the Bugs in addressbooks), and all that gets 
transmitted is the first screenful of my message!!!!! 

Is this also a bug in Pico? 

Here is the 2nd screenfull, seeing I can't get all of the message!.

The saga continues.....

Jim and the whole mailing list.

1. My apologies for all this extra mail :-(

2. I *have* tried to send it to myself (and other individuals) and 
   the message *does* get through whole. Ergo, it must be the pine-info
   mailing list that does it. :-(

3. I have isolated the problem to an "elipsis" (i.e. 3 dots/periods sitting
   in the first character field of the message body. After the last line:
	
	Group1Site2     First Group Site 2              (name5, etc)

   of the message, this elipsis (3 dots) occurred. *That* is where the 
   message gets truncated. 

   I hypothesise: 

	DO the andminstrators of the pine-info mailing list directly 
	use sendmail to bounce all the pine-info messages? If so,
	a "dot" in the first character field of any of the text will
	cause sendmail to barf at the remainder of the file.

	I can only assume that is the problem. :-(

4. I have now taken the offending characters out of the mail message,
   and will try one last time. 

   IF this doesn't work, I'll give up!


Apologies again,

Steve

Again apologies for all the extra traffic. Here finally is the WHOLE
message, minus offending characters.

Can anyone shed some light on the problem documented below.

Thank you.

======================================================================


Just a warning about the use of long addressbook lists - they cause Pine 
to crash. I'm not sure whether it's simply the number of entries, or what.

I have a reasonably long addressbook, with a number of levels of
'indirection'. For example, my research section is made up of
3 research groups, each which are split over 2 physical sites 
(separated by ~1100 kms). 

So, when I want to mail all members of the research section, my addressbook
entry looks like:

Section		Whole Research Section		(Group1, Group2, Group3)
Group1		First Group			(Group1Site1,Group1Site2)
Group2		Second Group			(Group2Site1,Group2Site2)
Group3		Third-and-Final Group		(Group3Site1,Group3Site2)
Group1Site1	First Group Site 1		(name1,name2,name3,name4)
Group1Site2	First Group Site 2		(name5,name6,name7,name8)
and so on.

I then choose to compose a message to the "Section" alias, which 
brings up the Pico editor with the last few lines of a long list of
names. If I then choose to move the cursor UP through the list (to 
look at names earlier on the list), I get:


Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.


Now, if I try sending to any of the "Group" aliases (or "GroupSite" aliases)
it works perfectly. (That is, I can cursor up the list to check/modify any
of the entries). 

The overall number of names in the whole "Section" alias is in excess 
of 60. Is this a problem?

Steve.

P.S. I also tried to remove one of the levels of 'indirection', by redifining
     the "Section" alias to be (Group1Site1,Group1Site2,Group2Site1....)
     It fails in the same way.

P.S. If any of the Pine developers would like a copy of the addressbook
     to test, please e-mail me. I don't wish to broadcast my whole 
     book to the Internet!!!

Well, removing the period from my Fullname solved my quotation mark
problem.  Thanks to those people that were able to help.  Anyone have any
ideas about the sorting problem? Or is this a bug in PINE.

I'll look into why the lines beginning with dots are terminating the 
messages.  We are using sendmail but I thought we were ignoring dots.

I'm a user, not running any systems.  However, I have a couple of
questions about pine that I have not been able to get answered.  Sorry if
these are DUMB questions (probably FAQs), but I have not had much luck any
place else.  

1.  Other than using the F forward command for each message one at a
time, is it possible to read a message into another message?  Sometimes I
want to put two or more messages together into one message and send them
to someone.  

2.  How do you set up the .pinerc or other files so that messages are
ordered in Reverse order automatically as received?  For example, I like
to see the most recent messages at the top of the list instead of the
older messages.  Currently, our pine mailer puts the oldest messages first
on the list in a folder.

3.  Is there any more detailed instructions on using pine available some
place (ftp?) that is a little more advanced or detailed than what is
available on-line? 

By the way, I'm using pine 3.07 on a UNIX system.  

Appreciate any help or information.  You can reply directly to my
e-mail address rather than boring everyone else.  

By the way, I like pine much better than some other mail programs I've
used over the years.

Thanks very much.

About the only way to do this right now is to save the messages to a 
file, then compose a new message and read (^R) that file.

You can use the Sort option to reverse the order of messages.  You cannot 
currently set a default sort order though.

The source distribution includes a few files on the doc directory 
(tech-notes, etc).  There are also a few other files on 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the /mail directory.

You could get the effect you want by using an alias and command line 
option.  In your .cshrc you could have this alias:

  alias pine  'pine -iz -sort R'

Is there a limit on the number of characters in an address in pine ?

I have this address which is 62 ( believe it or not) characters long. When
I try entering this address in the To: field, I am able to enter all the
charcters, but it gets chopped up when it is being sent out.

Any clues ?

Thanks

Actually, what I think is happening is that the names are being listed
alphabetically by the alias name (Christy,I,Sarah), rather than by your
actual first names.

Hello,

	I've a few questions related to PC pine....

1.	Since PC pine is not windows based (future?) what program would be
	used to display GIF images?  From where can that be ftp'd?

2.	In a dial-up slip enviornment, how does one make the combination of
	PC pine and IMAP interoperate so that a user may "download" their
	messages and read them "off-line".

3.	Being in Asia, we see "BOGUS DATE" displayed frequently since 
	many places use Time Zones that are not official.  Can this check be
	gotten around?


					Thanks....

Does the message actually get sent correctly?  I believe that the display 
of the address may look like it is chopped up in the composer but that 
it is only the display that is wrong.

Some addressbook bugs have been fixed since 3.07, though it isn't 
altogether clear (to me) which bugs were fixed.  In particular, Steve's 
addressbook which caused the problem he reported in 3.07 no longer causes 
a problem in the soon-to-be-released 3.85.

This is fixed in the soon-to-be-released version 3.85.  The mini-window 
where you enter the address will scroll to the right if you bump into the 
right hand edge.  Thanks.

Does anyone know the timeframe for this release?

Does anyone have a canonical list of what terminal emulation software
supports the "attached-to-ansi" printing method (and, equally importantly,
what does not)?  If such as list doesn't exist, then I'd be willing to put
one together if people send me their experiences.  Thanks.

On a related note, does anyone know the relation between standalone 
utility ansiprint and pine?  E.g., does pine use the same script that 
ansiprint uses?  Anyone know of an anon ftp site for ansiprint that 
I can point people to?

Thanks,
Nancy


PS - I don't think Pine's "attached-to-ansi" or ansiprint work with
Windows Terminal; they do work with Kermit.

When I was using WinQVT for Windows (a vt100 communications program),
printing to attached-to-ansi woul dump it to the printer I had on LPT1.

Of course, now that I'm using linux and connecting with a different
program, it doesn't work any more.  Oh well.

I have several customers who HP LaserJet printers with the (old?) 
HP Postscript cartridges which will process ONLY Postscript input.
Currently if they try to ansi-print their (ASCII) messages from pine,
the Postscript-only printer ignores the print request.  [ Removing the
Postscript cartridge - requiring power-off/on - is not an option. ]
Has anyone figured out out to use the pine 'Print' (L) command with a
Postscript-only [ HP LaserJet ] printer ???  -mr

The pine distribution contains an ansiprint replacement in the contrib 
directory.  The following is stripped from the code:

/*
 * ansiprt.c
 *
 * Simple filter to wrap ANSI media copy escape sequences around
 * text on stdin.  Writes /dev/tty to get around things that might be
 * trapping stdout.  This is actually a feature because it was written
 * to be used with pine's personal print option set up to take "enscript"
 * output and send it displayward to be captured/printed to a postscript
 * device.  Pine, of course, uses popen() to invoke the personal print
 * command, and interprets stdout as diagnostic messages from the command.

What about using option 3 (personally selected print command)
and specifying:

 enscript | ansiprint

Or if you want to be "gaudy" and save some paper:

 enscript -2r -G -fCourier7 | ansiprint

Does this work?

	That technically wouldn't work because enscript wouldn't know
where where to get it's input.  A better method would be to write an
external shell script, and call that script to from within Pine,  when
printing to a postscript only printer.  Here is a "hack" that a friend and
I worked out together.   The only problem is that it tends to hang, when
trying to ansiprint the enscripted file.  Maybe someone on this list can
offer some suggestions.  As a consultant, I get many questions reguarding
the printing of e-mail to postscript printers, so any help would be
greatly appreciated.  Thanks...

#
# Concept:        Timothy Lee      <koolkid@u.washington.edu>
# Implementation: Jared Reisinger  <jaredr@u.washington.edu>
# Last Change:    08 Sep 1993
#
# Overview
# --------
# "ansipsprint" allows you to send regular files to local PostScript
# printers which can't handle raw text.  This is intended for use
# with any program that would normally invoke "ansiprint" (or "ansiprt",
# which Pine uses) to print a text file on a local printer.
#
# All flags and parameters used on the command line are passed verbatim
# to "enscript", and stdin is also redirected, so "ansipsprint" will
# accept the file either on the command line or through a pipe.

ESC=                                          # escape character

OPEN=${ESC}[5i                                  # open printer ANSI sequence
CLOSE=${ESC}[4i                                 # close printer ANSI sequence

TEMPFILE=/usr/tmp/.ansipsprint$$                # temp file name

enscript -p $TEMPFILE $@ <&0 > /dev/null 2>&1   # enscript to the temp file

echo -n "${OPEN}"            > /dev/tty         # start printer
cat      $TEMPFILE           > /dev/tty         # send file to printer
echo -n "${CLOSE}"           > /dev/tty         # stop printer

rm -f $TEMPFILE                                 # remove temp file

echo -n "file has been sent"                    # exit message
exit 0                                          # exit successfully!

You need to do enscript -p <insert any additional switches needed> | ansiprt

ansiprint doesn't work from pine, but ansiprt, which came with the pine
distribution, does.

Why not...I use something similar all the time...
a2ps | lp -dlwrm9

works just fine...I guess it would depend on enscript being able to read
stdin (which...I hope it can...)

Is it possible to exit pine w/o writing the mailbox?  i.e. an emergency

Mike, I also have been successful with Procomm (2.4, I think) for the PC.
We also use PC-NFS, and version 4.0 telnet.exe does not support it.
Version 5.0 telnet does very nicely though.

Have pine developers considered creating shared libraries for use
in pine?  Perhaps a libpico shlib?  Seems like pine is getting really
*big*.  Like, a couple more revisions down the road seems like it
will approach the size of the x11r5 X server...

This is also a concern of ours...Pine is definitely a resource hog (but
that doesn't mean that I don't think it's a cool mailer...)  When 80 or so
users are using pine on one of our Sequents, 128Meg memory is a little shy...

Jason and Paul,
I have two questions and two comments.  The questions are concerned with how
much physical memory is used by the code itself; the comments concern memory 
required for Pine's *data*... 

1. If one is using a *reasonable* version of Unix that provides for sharing
text (code) segments by all users of the system, what is the advantage of
shared libraries in this particular case?  (I'm not asking Why shared
libraries in general? which I think I understand; I just don't see the
benefit for Pine in the normal VM case.)

2. Does anyone know for sure that Sequent PTX *does* support shared code
segments?  We have a large Sequent (typical peaks of 800 simultaneous users,
almost all running Pine) and the system *is* memory hungry --but we've seen
conflicting data on whether or not the code segment is really being shared
amongst all the Pine processes... 

Either way, we must also consider the issue of memory for data: 

3. The Berkeley mailbox driver, the one normally used by Pine, assumes the
existence of a decent virtual memory system.  It therefore reads the entire
mailbox into virtual memory and relies on the paging system for optimal
'conservation' of physical memory.  Unfortunately, we have not had time to do
any careful analysis of working sets or Pine behaviors that might
inadvertently keep the working sets larger than necessary.  However... 

4. If you are willing to forego INBOX compatibility with other mailers that
require Bky format, then you can use Pine with the "tenex2" driver. Upon
startup, this driver pulls mail from /usr/spool/mail, and puts it into a file
called ~/mail.txt in a format first used for Tenex mailers. The message
delimiters contain a length field and a fixed-length flags field, so that
updating message state does not require rewriting the mailbox.  In this case,
the driver builds a list of pointers to the beginning of messages on disk,
and does not read the entire mailbox into VM. In this mailbox format, text
searches --which Pine doesn't support yet, but will someday-- are slower, but
most other operations are faster. Moreover, the typical process RSS will be
smaller than when using the Bky driver.  (Whether that *should* matter on a
good VM system is another question...)

Pine 3.85 uses the Tenex2 driver whenever the file ~/mail.txt exists, so if 
you want to try this out: 
  -pick up 3.85 next week (earlier versions lack the latest tenex driver)
  -touch mail.txt
  -Run pine.

Note that this operation is not easily reversible; that is, you can't 
just cat mail.txt back to /usr/spool/mail if you don't want to use the
Tenex driver any more.

-teg

p.s. the comparison to X program sizes was a bit of a low blow!  Consider:

  213 shiva2:bin> size xclock pine.new.new
  text    data    bss     dec     hex
  798720  163840  30544   993104  f2750   xclock
  757760  303104  82736   1143600 117330  pine.new.new

So in terms of code size, we have another 40K-worth of code to write
before we've even matched xclock!! :)

Terry...

I see your point...thank you...

I will check with Sequent as to whether or not PTX supports shared code
segments...

I don't remember this being discussed in the past, but I figure I'll bring
it up. :-)

Is there any plans in the future (most probably too late for 3.85) to
allow transparent use of PGP from within pine? (ie, being able to sign
and/or encrypt the message).

For the most part, it seems it would be pretty easy to do this, simply
passing the mail message through PGP prior to it it being sent on its way.

--

As for how to do it from a use standpoint?  Make it an Old-Growth option
or have to user define 'pgp=yes' in .pinerc.  Then, to invoke a pgp
mailing, you would press something like shift-C or perhaps some other key.
 
The message would be composed normally, but, when you exit, you are asked
'Encrypt (y/n) [n]'.  Pressing return defaults to no encryption and simply
sends out the message with your PGP signature [ie, pgp -sa filename] 

If you ask for encryption, it seeks your public-keyring, matching the
people you are mailing to to their public keys.  It also adds your PGP
signature. [ie, pgp -esa filename address1 address2 address3 ...]

--

er . . . 

In any case, it's a feature I would find most usefule and I'd think it
would be a pretty easy thing to add.

I appreciate any comments.

It's even simpler than that: they show up in the address in the same order
that they were defined in the "Board" alias...

I can't recall the name of the one we've been playing with, but I've 
never gotten it to work successfully from *within* PC-Pine, due to 
memory limitations...

With SLIP or PPP installed, and a dialup connection established, PC-Pine 
connects to the IMAP server in the usual way.  The two things you will 
quickly discover are that:

 o Pine lacks a *convenient* way of saving all (or NEW) messages from
   your INBOX to a local folder on the PC, although you can do it one-
   at-a-time.

 o Once you have the desired messages saved locally, you can read them
   offline (by ignoring the error you get when Pine tries to talk to 
   the IMAP server), but there is no way to reply or forward or compose
   new messages while offline.

YET.  Both of these issues will be addressed as soon as we can get to them.

Well, yes, but I think they are being sorted when you define the list in 
the first place, so you don't get to choose the order by entering them in 
your desired order.  (You could edit .addressbook and change the order, 
though.)

To expand on Terry's message about the Berkeley mailbox driver, the reason why
it is implemented that way has to do with a ``safe'' means of updating the
mailbox.  The problem is that in the mbox format, it is possible for a folder
to grow after an update -- that is, the introduction of Status/X-Status header
lines may result in a message becoming larger.  Basically, there are two
choices on how to deal with this:
 1) use the disk for a second copy
 2) use memory for a second copy

System managers tend to use nasty things called ``disk quotas'' which would
make strategy #1 useless for a folder that is any larger than the amount of
unused space in the user's disk quota.  The other problem with strategy #1 is
that one of the locking schemes commonly used (remember, Pine has to use *all*
forms of locking to be sure it interacts properly with other software)
involves the use of an flock() system call, which in turn requires that the
inode of the folder not change.  So you can't just ``write the new version of
the file then rename'' as you might do with an editor; you have to write the
new version, then copy the new version on top of the old version.

Hence strategy #2, which does the work in memory and merely uses the disk as a
saved image of the memory version for future use.

The tenex folder avoids this problem, because the fundamental nature of the
format guarantees that no message can ever become larger than it currently is.
The space for flags is pre-allocated and guaranteed to be in a single place,
neither of which is true in mbox format.

I concur... I sincerely hope that simple instructions are given for compiling up
a version of Pine that does NOT include this "feature" (stronger words spring to
mind!)

I often use the filename "msg.txt" when exporting a message I need temporarily.
I can quite well believe others using "mail.txt" with DISASTROUS consequences
(in the developers' own words the process of converting to Tenex format is "not
easily reversible!")

Pine has always had this behavior.

So does mm, and so (I think) does babyl.

Please explain how it is ``disastrous'' to have Pine decide to use a format of
mail that is faster, more efficient, and uses *substantially* less memory?

Pine will *NOT* convert formats just because a file named mail.txt exists on
the home directory.  The mail.txt file must be empty or in the proper format.
If the file is non-empty and not in the proper format, then it is ignored.

Other UNIX-based programs, such as zmail, babyl, mm, and mh, will convert your
INBOX to their preferred formats just because you had the audacity to run
those programs.

Personally, I can't see why anyone would want to convert back (once you use
Pine, you want to stick with Pine, right?), but the program to convert back is
trivial (about 10 lines using c-client).  It is ``not easily reversible'' only
because Pine doesn't have a command to reverse (Pine's older brother, the
MailManager application under NEXTSTEP, does have this feature).  If you want,
though, I'll write and post the program.

We have a large proportion of "naive" users and not very many staff to support
them (but doesn't everyone think this?!).  Anything which can leap in and change
things to a different format from the "norm" is unwelcome, opening the door for
increased support problems.

Also, we have a number of other little utilities which (perhaps stupidly, I
admit:-) kind of assume that a person's mailbox is in the standard place for our
system.

I believe it should be a decision of the system administrators whether or not to
switch to a particular format of mailbox, not the whim of some program.
(Particularly one that doesn't make this clear in its documentation!)

At least this is a small mercy I suppose.  So a judiciously placed "return (0)"
or something when in the mail.txt file format test should suffice ;-)  [See
below]

None of which we use, nor have any intention of using.  This argument is a red
herring ("I only broke into the bank 'cause others do it, Guv!")

IRIX on our Silicon Graphics kit comes with "mail" and "Mail" (BSD-type).  And
until now we have been using Elm.  All of these happily use the same basic
"inbox" format (and keep their sticky little fingers to themselves).

Strange... that's what we thought about Elm!

Which has to be written, and explanation  on how to backtrack given to those
users who've run into the problem.  No thanks!

Thanks for the offer, but I think I would prefer to look at disabling the
feature (I'm sure I can hack it out fairly easily ... a 

One of main aims at migrating our existing userbase from Elm to Pine is to ease
the learning curve and reduce support load (which Pine looks to be very good
at).  I see little reason to be forced ("encouraged"?) down a route whereby
mailbox formats can potentially get munged from the system default format.

STOP PRESS...

I have just received the second message indicating that this is NOT a new
feature due in the next release of Pine (as I had originally thought from
previous messages) but is already present in 3.07.  I've tried it... and it is!

Consequently even as I type I am recompiling, specifically excluding the Tenex
driver--thank heavens for modular programs!  Sigh.

Hmm.  I did just check this feature.  It's nice, but I do have one question to
bring up.  When pine is initiated using a Tenex2 style mailbox, and then
an export message is done using the filename "mail.txt", it will ask (and be
able to) append the message to the file mail.txt.  This causes problems when
pine is run again.  It will say "bad message number X" where x is the last
message, and then close the inbox.  I know that for most people on this list,
it would not be a problem, but for users who are not familiar with how the
mailbox/mail.txt works, it could be a problem.  Could it be possible to make
pine disallow saving to mail.txt if it currently being used as the mailbox?

We do not have the resources to make tapes of Pine, but perhaps there is 
some kind sole out there who can help...

I don't remember any reports one way or the other about CTIX, what is it 
similar to?

Subject: Getting pine.tar on DC600 tape.

Hello owners: I am VERY new to this list (this is my 1st posting 8-) )
and would like to describe a situation and some questions that arise from
it: I have two old System/80 of Unisys runnig a CTIX O/S which is version
5.2.25; I am told I can not upgrdate the unix/ctix version due to chip
incompitabilty. I would like to run a free-of-charge bbs using this old
equipment and employ pine for this end.
The questions that come to mind (my mind, that is):
1) Is it ok?
2) Can I get a version of pine.tar on a DC600, say if I send you one?
3) will it run on v.5.2.25? 

Thank you, Yigal Rechtman

Wouldn't it make more sense to have ".mail.txt" or something else?  Preferably a
hidden dot file.  I know that I would not care to have any extra files in my
home directory, which I prefer to leave containing no actual files, but only the
various sub-directories that I do my work in....

I believe that Pine 3.85 won't let you make this mistake.  Older versions of
Pine assumed that all mailboxes were in mbox format, and would append in that
format without checking.

Mark,
Alex refers to "export message"... rather than "save message"
Unlike Save, Export should (and I think does) append to any file,
if you say yes to the "append" prompt.

We made Export preserve the "From " line so that such files *could* be
read as mailboxes, but Export was intended to copy the message text to a
*file* not a "folder".  So Export to a mail.txt file used as a
Tenex-format INBOX is a problem... though I hope not one that will occur
very often.  Save, rather than Export, certainly should be used whenever
there is an expectation of "mailboxness", and should be safe in the
situation described. 

(Alex, if you really were using Save rather than Export, please disregard 
this message.)

The command in question is export, which is just used to copy a message 
out of the mail store into a text file.  It does no checking at all, and 
I don't think any is appropriate.

Tenex2 seems like a good idea.  If there's not a bunch of people using it
yet, how about putting the mail file where this isn't going to happen,
like in subdirectory?  It's real easy to clobber a file name mail.txt

Just an idea....

What it is - is Unix V. Why it is called CTIX I have no idea. Nor am I a
"Meven" about Unix in General. It IS unix, but for some reason the people
who made it's shell call it CTIX. What I understand is, that it is tied
directly to the S/80 chip, and therefor the Ctix/Unix can not be upgraded
- somthing on these lines.

In Pine, saved messages are always in mbox format too, unless the folder
already exists in a different format.  This is true regardless of the
format of the INBOX.  (This is considered a feature by most folks, who use
other messaging tools with the same saved-msg folders; e.g. trn)

The differences between save and export are:

  -Save preserves the *entire* message, complete with Received-from headers,
   whereas Export omits the normally-hidden headers and omits attachments.

  -Save sniffs the target folder and appends in whatever format the 
   folder already is; but if it doesn't exist yet, Pine uses mbox format.
   In contrast, Export always uses mbox format.

  -Save normally stores to a folder in the default folder collection 
   (typically in ~/mail) whereas Export uses the home directory by default.

As you know, there are several complex issues lurking concerning mailbox
formats and how to specify/control/accommodate them... As soon as we get
3.85 out the door, we need to focus on this as a generic problem.

Terry and Laurence -

     I see.  This is the same problem we had in MM back in 1979.  There was a
LIST command to list messages to the lineprinter, and then came a FILE-LIST
command to put a listing to a file, and sure enough, someone did a FILE-LIST
and specified MAIL.TXT as the target.  Oops.

     If Export preserves an mbox-format ``From '' line, then how does it
differ from Save?  Just in the semantics of the target?  A Save that always
saves in mbox format even if the user uses Tenex format?

     I'm wondering if we can't make Export a bit more paranoid.  Perhaps it
should refuse to write to an extant file, or it should see if the file opens
as a mailbox first?

Yes, this is exactly what I was trying to say.  (but I screwed it up....duh.)

The problem that I forsee is that if someone actually does export the
message to mail.txt, it will make it so pine will not be able to read the
folder.  Is there some way to make it so it can't save to this file if
it's being used as the inbox? (or rename the inbox)?

thanx...alex...

Here's a workaround that might save some of you from having to edit 
source to prevent mail.txt from taking over as inbox.  If a user 
explicitly defines inbox-path to be something, then when INBOX is opened 
it will use that instead of asking for the generic INBOX (which has the 
mail.txt semantics wired-in).  So,

inbox-path=/usr/spool/mail/hubert

would cause my mail to be read from and left in /usr/spool/mail/hubert 
even if I had a mail.txt file in my home directory.  As system manager, 
you ought to be able to define inbox-path in the /usr/local/lib/pine.conf 
file so it is something like

inbox-path=/usr/spool/mail/$USER   or
inbox-path=/usr/spool/mail/$LOGNAME

or whatever is appropriate for your system.  A user could still override 
this with an explicit

inbox-path=""

There is no designed-in feature to do this.  About the only way I can 
think to do it is to kill the pine process.  A kill -9 <pine_pid> would 
cause it to die without having a chance to rewrite the mailbox.  Of 
course, pine does do automatic checkpointing based on keystroke counts, 
so it is possible that the mailbox will already have been updated if 
you've been looking at it and changing it.

This is a repost.  I had hoped that someone would have a suggestion for

experiencing the same problem.  Basically, it works sometimes, and others
it doesn't.

What I expect to see when I try to extract an attachment is:

...and not:

This is Pine version 3.07-- is it fixed in the new release?
Someone please tell me where I made my lame mistake.

Yes, but it won't be recognized as an INBOX.  Specifically, mail won't be
snarfed from /usr/spool/mail/$USER into it.  Only ~/mail.txt is recognized as
a Tenex style INBOX, and only when you open it as INBOX, not as mail.txt.

But what I want to know is if it is possible to have an INBOX of a different
name.  I don't like the idea of a file name ~/mail.txt in my home directory,
cluttering up my otherwise organized directory structure.  I would much rather
have it as ~/.mail.txt, or ~/.inbox, or best of all, in my ~/mail subdirectory
with all my other folders as ~/Mail/inbox......

  Is this possible, and if not, why not?  Why not make this the default?

This sounds like a problem that will be fixed in Pine 3.85.  There has 
been alot of improvement made to attachment processing.  Pine 3.85 will 
be available later this week.

Hi all,

Probably something that has been addressed in the new version of Pine, however
I'll mention it anyway.

I regularly receive mail with headers of the form:

From: Tourenne
<uunet.UU.NET!vital!unixmailgate!tourenne@squiggle.resntl.bhp.com.au> 
To:uunet.UU.NET!uunet!VENUS.RESNTL.BHP.COM.AU!steve@squiggle.resntl.bhp.com.au
Subject: RE: Hello

When I go to save the message in a folder, it tries to create a folder 
named:

uunet.UU.NET!vital!unixmailgate!tourenne@squiggle.resntl.bhp.com.au

which of course I want to change. The only problem is that the length of 
the name of that default folder leaves me no room to type a new folder 
name in, after the prompt!

Steve.

DYNIX/ptx does not support shared libraries.  It does only load one copy 
of a certain portion of each distinct binary that is invoked.

No, a tenex-format INBOX is fixed as ~/mail.txt

There are some good reasons why this is the case.  Here are some of them:

I didn't want to get involved with subdirectories, because:
 1) using an existing name (such as ~/mail/, ~/Mail/, ~/Mailboxes, etc.) would
    bring it into conflict with other applications which think they own the
    contents of a particular named subdirectory.
 2) using a new name would be Yet Another Subdirectory Name for mail.

The ~/.mail.txt is an idea, but I don't like the idea of a large file such as
your mail INBOX being an invisible file.  This is particularly the case on
systems with disk quotas.  Try explaining to a person why he is over quota
``but I only have one little file in my directory'' sometime.

A problem with it being user-configurable means that you run the risk of bad
behavior happening when the configuration file gets corrupted or lost.  In a
past life as a systems programmer, I had to deal with entirely too many ``my
mail disappeared'' problem reports that turned out to be a entirely due to a
non-standard setting in a configuration file getting zapped.

Another problem with it being user-configurable means that you have a user
services problem.  It's one thing to ask for your mail file to be restored by
an operator (or ask a systems programmer to fix a problem in your mail file)
when it is in a well-known place.  It is quite another when it can be almost
anywhere.

For the record, I need to point out that Mark's explanation/defense of the
current Pine/IMAPd behavior (wherein the existence of a zero-length
mail.txt file will trigger Pine or IMAPd to begin using the Tenex driver
for INBOX processing)... does not represent a consensus position of the
Pine team. 

After we get 3.85 out the door* we will be focusing on the inter-related
problems of hierarchy support, selecting among different folder
namespaces, and controlling mailbox format.  Stay tuned...

I would say that a good approach to both of these issues is not to
apply dictatorial solutions because they are easier, but to provide
sufficient resource discovery tools for the end user and system
administrators. Examples which come to mind of solutions to analagous
problems are the ucb `which' command to tell you which of possibly
many identically named commands in your path you are executing, and
the -query option to xrdb, the X windows resource database utility,
with which you can find out the value of any of the ten thousand
variables controlling your X-windows behavior. Of course, in that
instance just knowing what to look for can be a daunting task, but the
biggest administrative problems come from sorcerer's
apprentices---users who blindly took a wizard's configuration over the
system configuration. That's a small group which might deserve what it
gets if the rest of the world gets something good.

Pine is already well past the point where "keep it simple" arguments
deserve automatic priority. Keep it useful is now more important.

We have a number of users wishing to send messages in European
languages.  In particular, they wish to compose messages containing 
accents and umlauts.   The mailer that they use is the Unix version
of Pine.  It so happens that they access Unix from MS-DOS on a PC.
For the letter a with an umlaut they type alt-132.  This works for
pico, but they have not succeeded in getting it to work when they
are in the message-composition part of Pine.

Should they be setting the character-set variable to ISO-8859-1?

Another question: what role has the show-all-characters variable?

Thanks in advance.

Barry,

Yes, you should be setting character-set=ISO-8859-1 if you are going to 
be using 8-bit characters.  If you have character-set=US-ASCII, the 
terminal driver is not initialized with LPASS8 and high bits will be 
stripped in Pine.  Pico is 8-bit clean and does not care what 
character-set you are using.

The show-all-characters variable has been deprecated.  It used to switch 
between filtering and non-filtering of mismatched character sets.  i.e. 
if your character-set was US-ASCII, any non-US-ASCII character would be 
displayed as '_'.  This feature has been removed.  If your character-set 
does not match an incoming message, you will be warned, but Pine will 
blast away...

Which is the PC code for a-umlaut.  The ISO-8859-1 code is not 132, and
you have to use the ISO-8859 character sets.

You need a PC telnet client with the ability to translate between the
ISO-8859-n and PC character sets.  I don't know any, but it would be
fairly easy to graft Keld Simonsen's code into NCSA telnet to do it, send
me mail if you want details.

We have heard of several stabs at a VMS port of Pine, but not of any 
successes.  If you find/complete one, we would like to hear about it!

THE NEWS...

On behalf of the entire Pine team, I'm pleased to be able to tell you that
Version 3.85 of Pine and PC-Pine is now available.  The release also
includes new versions of Pico and IMAPd.  This version is believed to run
on quite a few more Unix flavors than previous versions. 


STATUS...

Although some code in 3.85 is relatively "fresh", we are not aware of any 
serious bugs --otherwise you would be waiting even longer for this message :)

Like many of you, we've been working toward installing this version at UW
in time for Fall Quarter... and we know that we're late.  So, if anyone
finds any serious bugs, please let us know ASAP so that we can address them
quickly!  (Of course, we want to know about not-so-serious bugs as well.)

Please note: there are bugs that you have reported to us that are not yet
fixed... though hopefully no show-stoppers.  If you find one that is
really annoying you, please gently remind us!  And if in doubt, report it! 


HOW TO GET IT...

--> Via anonymous FTP

  ftp pine.cac.washington.edu
  user: anonymous
  passwd: your email address
  binary
  cd mail
  get pine.tar.Z    <-- full distribution, including Pico and IMAPd
  get pcpine_f.zip  <-- version for FTP PC/TCP
  get pcpine_n.zip  <-- version for Novell LWP
  get pcpine_s.zip  <-- version for Sun PC/NFS
  get pcpine_p.zip  <-- version for Packet Driver
  quit

There will also be precompiled binaries available for certain
platforms.  These will have names like pine-bin.ultrix.

--> Via PC-Pine

PC-Pine users can also obtain new versions via the "Update" option under 
the Main Menu "Setup" command.  From the Folder Index of the Update 
Server, just select and View the msg containing the version you need, 
then View/Save the attached Zip file.

Because attachment encoding/decoding has not *yet* been performance-tuned,
this will be slower than FTP, but may be more convenient.  (Let us know 
what you think!)


RELEASE NOTES EXCERPTS...

The complete release notes are available via the "R" command on the
Main menu of Pine 3.85.  Here are some highlights...

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- Pine 3.85 is the first integrated Unix/DOS release, and the first 
  PC-Pine source-code release.  It also brings Unix Pine in sync with
  changes introduced in PC-Pine 3.84 last July.

- Pine 3.85 has several major new features (compared to Pine 3.07):
   o Various UI improvements (command consistency, simplification, etc).
   o Multiple folder collections.
   o Remote folder create/append (requires new IMAPd).
   o Composer has Mark command for block cut/paste.
   o Improved handling of text and postscript attachments.
   o Improved mailbox lock handling: latest Pine will now be read-write.
   o Messages directly to you marked with "+" in Folder Index.
   o Messages that have been answered marked with "A" in Folder Index.
   o Several new .pinerc options.
   o Easier access to newsgroups (but still not a full newsreader).

- Several command key changes were needed to allow for new features:
   o Print is now "Y" instead of "L"
   o The Folder List is now uniformly accessible via "L"
   o Viewing/saving attachments is now done via "V" instead of "A"
   o SortIndex is now "$" instead of "Z"

- There are several known limitations in the PC version:
   o There is no spelling checker.
   o Sorting the Index (by other than Arrival) is *hopelessly* slow.
   o The alternate editor function is not available.
   o Memory: it needs about 500K out of 640K.
   o Probably can't run image viewer from within Pine, due to memory.
   o Performance optimization still needs to be done.
   o Versions: packet driver, Novell LWP, FTP PC-TCP, Sun PC-NFS


NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS (3.07 to 3.85)

  - Release includes PC-Pine ports, as well as Unix Pine.
  - Support for multiple folder collections.
  - Ability to create and/or append to remote folders via (new) IMAPd.
  - Mark and cut feature in composer.
  - Messages directly to you marked with "+" in Folder Index.
  - Messages that have been answered marked with "A" in Folder Index.
  - Ability to view plain text attachments.
  - Correct MIME type assigned for text, postscript and TIFF files.
  - Configurable by feature (instead of having to choose 1 feature level).
  - Initial keystroke list in configuration or command line.
  - Command line -p flag to specify an alternate personal config file.
  - Command line -P flag to specify an alternate system-wide config file.
  - Command line -o flag for opening a mailbox Read-Only.
  - More support for USENET news access via both IMAP and NNTP
    (The NNTP driver reads/updates local newsrc configuration files).
  - Changed order of reply prompts to reduce mistakes.
  - In the Save command, folder name completion using TAB key.
  - More consistency of commands across screens.
  - Main menu command selection via Prev/Next/Enter.
  - An option for automatically saving read-messages upon quitting.
  - Better INBOX lock handling: latest Pine always gets read-write access.
  - Improved display defaults for charsets other than us-ascii.
  - PC-Pine: code-page translation to ISO-8859 charset.
  - PC-Pine: improvements in how location of config files are specified.
  - PC-Pine: generate X-Sender line with authenticated address.
  - PC-Pine: more config flexibility in specifying location of support files.
  - PC-Pine: prompts before saving user name in pinerc; can disable save.
  - PC-Pine: NNTP driver changed to warn of missing NEWSRC file.
  - PC-Pine: if \PINE\PINE.PWD exists, prompts for saving passwd on disk.
  - Changed Keyboard lock strategy to eliminate use of system passwd file.
  - Removed disk quota command (hard to make it accurate!)
  - Reorganized source code to make ports more straight forward.          
  - Integrated several contributed ports.
  - Pinerc configuration variable for addressbook location.
  - SMTP-host config variable now allows a list of host names.
  - Choice of several rules for generating default folder names in Save.
  - Several other new .pinerc options.
  - Many bug fixes!

Handling Locking with multiple sessions.

Pine 3.84 introduced a new mechanism to handle competition between
multiple sessions for a single INBOX.  Previously, the first session would
have to be stopped before another could get read/write permissions on an
open inbox.  Now, the newest session forces the older session to surrender
read/write access to the mailbox.  Note: non-standard mailbox formats
exist wherein multiple sessions may all have read-write access.  See the
Tech Notes in the Pine distribution for more details.

Folder Collections.

Pine allows you to have full access to sets of folders on you local
machine and any IMAP server.  These sets of folders are called "collections"
and Pine has some special new browsing features to take advantage of them.
By default, everyone has one folder collection.  Additional collections may
be defined by editing your .pinec configuration file.

MIME Attachments.

Pine now recognizes attachments which are displayable text and marks them
the appropriate MIME type for text.  Pine has a new system for determining
which MIME text attachments should be displayed automatically and which
should be displayable on request.  In addition there is a new text
attachment viewer module just for browsing these attachments.  Finally,
Pine will now recognize postscript files and TIFF image files and assign
the correct MIME type information in the message.


OTHER THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

Several commands can be enabled by .pinerc options, but not all of them
actually exist yet.  In particular: Flag, Bounce, Pipe, Apply, Zoom Also:
news item eXclude/uneXclude and news group subscription/unsubscription are
note yet available. 

Unfortunately, when you Save a message to a folder, the message state
flags (e.g. whether it was Deleted, or Answered) are not preserved.  This
will be fixed in the next release. 

NNTP vs. IMAP for News: Having a local newsrc file is only needed if news
groups are accessed via NNTP rather than IMAP.  If you have an account on
a machine storing news files, and runs IMAPd, leave your newsrc file there
and use IMAP to access news, rather than NNTP.  This is accomplished by
omitting the /nntp flag in the news host specification in your .pinerc.
(NOTE: full NetNews functionality is not yet available in Pine; stay tuned.)

The Goto command must now be explicitly enabled by a .pinerc option...
Because it requires explicit text input, as opposed to picking from a list
of folders, Goto was deemed to be a more power-user oriented command.  In
the past, it was the only way to get from Index or View back to Folders
without first going to the Main menu, but with the advent of "L ListFldrs"
that is no longer true. (NOTE: Unix system managers may restore Goto for
everyone at once by enabling the command in the global pine config file.)

If a file called .mailboxlist exists in any folder-collection directory,
attempts to list folders in that collection may fail. Pine will interpret
the contents of that file as the list of interesting mailboxes... but if
the empty file exists, then it will appear that all of your folders have
disappeared. Unfortunately, we just recently learned that Stanford's
Xlview program will silently create this file.  The next version of Pine
will definitely be changed to avoid this problem. 

If a file called ~/mail.txt exists and is either empty or appears to be a
Tenex-style mailbox, Pine will decide to use its "tenex2" driver which
will move all pending mail from /usr/spool/mail/$USER to mail.txt, and use
mail.txt as your INBOX.  This behavior is subject to change. 

Pine 3.85 will not permit you to create folders ending in .txt This is due
to constraints on how mailbox drivers are selected, and is also likely to
change in the next release.  However, you can rename an existing folder to
end in .txt. 

COMING ATTRACTIONS (but don't ask when!)

  - Shared (plus personal) address books
  - Improved network news support, including posting and subscribing
  - Implementation of "missing" commands (Bounce, Pipe, Flag)
  - Improved MIME support, including "mailcap"
  - For PC-Pine, beginnings of "offline" support
  - For PC-Pine, performance improvement
  - A Windows/Winsock version (though not initially a GUI)
  - Access to remote support files: address books, newsrc, pinerc
  - Operations on multiple messages (aggregate operations)
  - Threaded Index views
  - Improved Search capability
  - Access to directory services from Composer


We hope you will find Pine 3.85 useful.  Comments are always welcome;

Pine 3.85 contains the really nifty feature that messages that are sent 
directly to you (ie, your mail address is in the To: field) are marked in 
the index with a +.  This feature allows you to quickly see what messages 
you might want to look at first, as opposed to messages that might be to 
a mailing list.  

An old Xerox mailer used to have this feature (any Hardy users out 
there?), but it would also allow you to mark messages cc'd directly to 
you as well.  So below I present a small hack to allow you to mark 
messages to yourself.  If you install this, you'll see a '+' if the 
message has you in the to *or* cc list.  (I have a vague recollection 
that I might have suggested this feature to the Pine folks, so I get to 
hack it the way I want it.  And if I didn't suggest it, they must have 
read my mind.)

Now all I want is the ability to sort on messages with that '+' mark.

Whenever I try to delete a name from the address book, it says error 
writing addressbook, permission denied or something to that effect.  
After I tried that 2-3 times, it said received abort signal and died...

When I try to create an addressbook with a list with 67 names in it
constructed according to the pattern (as I close as I can tell) of the
addressbooks created by pine 3.07, I have not found it to work.  Either
the names in the list get jumbled once I have run pine 3.07 or it simply
hangs.  Is the problem that Pine doesn't want to handle lists with 67
names, or am I not recognizing some subtle format considerations.

Does the recent version of Pine handle long address lists more easily?

	From blah@blah.blah.edu

Save to folder:

	From highway@wam.umd.edu

How do I change this or remedy this.

Yes, there are several bugs in the 3.07 addressbook code.  We hope we got 
most of them.

Sorry for the premature report of an addressbook problem. I had created a
file to serve as an addressbook with a mail list with 67 entries in Pine
3.07.  I had omitted commas at the end of one or two lines - once I
corrected this, and fed the resulting addressbook to pine it did seem to
work OK. 
Thanks,
Dan

I've just upgraded to 3.85 from 3.07. Both versions have the 'feature' 
that they dump a core in my home directory when I 'quit'. I really don't 
need an 8-9 Mbyte core file permanently hanging around.

I'm running on a Sun IPX with SunOS4.1.3. I tried rebuilding 3.85 with 
debugging turned off but than doesn't seem to help.

Is this a Sun specific feature or is it just me?

	Sounds like it is a "Sun specific feature".  I've been using both
pine 3.07 and now 3.85 on a MIPS machine and it has never had the occasion
to core dump.

Subject: NEWSRC format for PC-Pine

Hi
I have been trying my luck with PC-Pine 3.85 and news reading. I finally found
the format that seems to work, e.g.
comp.lang.c :
Without any included item numbers there are lots of [HOLES] messages from the
NNTP server which appear as message missing. Exiting Pine I get a message that
it is updating the status of the folder (I guess to mark them as read/unread)
but nothing changes in the newsrc file (I found it had to go in c:\newsrc).
Could someone help me get the format, etc right.
Thanks
Neil

I think your problem is that you are not compiling using the -Xs option.
I have successfully compiled 3.85 for SunOS 5.2 (Solaris 2.2), having used:
   /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -Xs ...
for the compilations.

Perhaps this has already been covered, sorry if I missed it.  Is there  a
way to set a global addressbook in pine, or import one?  Is there a way to
have more than one addressbook?

Alas, not yet.  But this is definitely on the "short list".

The first step in that direction has been taken, with the addition of the 
"address-book" variable in the .pinerc file for Pine 3.85.  The only 
problem with using this now to share a single addressbook is that there 
are file locking problems that have not been addressed...

As Terry hinted at, there will be support for multiple and remote 
addressbooks in a future release.  The remote case is almost trivial, but 
the multiple case requires some redesign...

The easiest way to "get it right" is to copy a .newsrc from a Unix host.  
Pine uses the same format, and you can pick up right where you left off 
with rn/trn/nn...

Right now, Newsreading in Pine is *very* primitive, but enhancements are 
very definitely coming.

I have found a repeatable bug in the Solaris version of Pine.  When replying
to a message I get a core dump about 80% of the time.  Is anyone else 
having this problem?

Are you using pine-bin-solaris from pine.ftp.washington.edu or a binary 
that you have built yourself?   I have built a version of Pine 3.85 for 
SunOS 5.2 (Solaris 2.2) and it doesn't seem to suffer from the problem 
you mention.

On a Sun SparcStation 2 running SunOS 4.1.3 we do not have this problem...

I've managed to compile pine under SCO UNIX v3.2.4 (after some twiddling
with the c-client code to get mmdf working). I used the os-gen files under
pine/osdep to get it all compiled.

All seems to work pretty well (ie I can read messages), accept when I try to
read the following message:

I simply copied my .newsrc from my Unix account and it seems to work well
from that.  If you don't have a Unix template to go by, e-mail me and I'll
send you a copy of mine.

However, I do have a concern of my own regarding reading news in PC-Pine --
It seems that it takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r when I go into news groups that have
more than a handful of articles posted.  I have a 486DX/66MHz system
running DOS 6 and NCSA Telnet with plenty of disc space. When I went into a
group with 154 articles, it has been sorting for the past hour nonstop (I
hope my hard disc survives!) -- I've let it sort for several hours before I
finally give up and turn the darn thing off.  This is true for any news
group I have tried -- I can't imagine any user wanting to wait that long to
read news!!

Our Mac users use NewsWatcher and the results are fairly instantaneous
(well, at least compared to what I have seen with the news on PC-Pine).

Any ideas what's causing this??  Thanks!

Yes.  We're painfully aware of what's happening, and hope to make
substantial improvements in PC-Pine sorting performance.  For now,
all I can say is: learn to like "arrival" order... :)

I built pine 3.85 on an RS/6000 730 without any difficulty.  However,
executing it results in the following message & termination:::

Who are you?  (Unable to look up login name)

Any idea what isn't configured correctly???

Subject: patch to 3.85 to mark msgs cc to self with +

Pine 3.85 contains the really nifty feature that messages that are sent 
directly to you (ie, your mail address is in the To: field) are marked in 
the index with a +.  This feature allows you to quickly see what messages 
you might want to look at first, as opposed to messages that might be to 
a mailing list.  

An old Xerox mailer used to have this feature (any Hardy users out 
there?), but it would also allow you to mark messages cc'd directly to 
you as well.  So below I present a small hack to allow you to mark 
messages to yourself.  If you install this, you'll see a '+' if the 
message has you in the to *or* cc list.  (I have a vague recollection 
that I might have suggested this feature to the Pine folks, so I get to 
hack it the way I want it.  And if I didn't suggest it, they must have 
read my mind.)

Now all I want is the ability to sort on messages with that '+' mark.

The problem is that you have a space between the newsgroup name and the 
colon.  There should be a space after the colon, but not before.

Normally, you should not be manually creating or editing a newsrc file. 
If you go to a newsgroup that is not in the newsrc file, Pine will
automatically add it to the list in the proper format. 

The [HOLES] message indicates that you are talking to an NNTP server that
does not support the new LISTGROUP command.  With such an NNTP server, 
there is no way to know what message numbers exist and what ones do not 
exist, so even though it knows that there are, say, 435 messages in the 
newsgroup with a range of 5 to 899 it does not know what the 332nd 
message is (there are gaps in the sequence).  Such holes will show up in 
the browser as empty mesages.

With an NNTP server that supports the LISTGROUP command, Pine can 
suppress the holes.  The INN NNTP server is such a server.

If you can establish an IMAP-based news server (meaning that the .newsrc 
is on the server, so you have an account on the server), you'll find that 
sorting will be much faster.  It won't be instantaneous, but there would 
be a lot less work on the network and on the PC.  Also, UNIX Pine and PC 
Pine will be at much closer to the same speed.

What is happening is that Pine is ending up fetching all the messages and
sorting.  With UNIX Pine, this is merely an annoyance, but in PC Pine, it
is disasterous; since it only has limited caching (and even index
information has to be rolled out to disk -- thank you, DOS 640K limits...)
it often ends up fetching the same information, over and over again. 

We know that this is terrible.  We don't sort NNTP newsgroups with PC
Pine.  We will be working on this.  We apologize for this problem, but
given the long delays to release Pine 3.85 we really didn't want to hold
the release another several months to get this fixed.  It is my hope that
we will have more frequent releases (including maintenance releases) after
this.

Do you have sorting in NewsWatcher?  I would be very interested to know 
how the Mac does it (I suspect it keeps a local cache on the disk).

It didn't build on ULTRIX 4.1.  Pico did, but pine didn't.  Anyone have
help for this architecture?

I just now built Pine 3.85 under Ultrix 4.1.3 - './build ult' is all it took.

Hmm.  Works for me, too.  I just tried it on a system that claims to be

Don't really know, but it means that this simple function is returning NULL.

char *
get_system_login()
{
    if(unix_pwd == NULL) {
        if(!pwd_looked_up) {
            unix_pwd = getpwuid(getuid());
            pwd_looked_up = 1;
        }
        if(unix_pwd == NULL)
          return((char *)NULL);
    }
    return(unix_pwd->pw_name);
}

which looks like it means that getpwuid(getuid()) is returning NULL.  I 
don't remember seeing this problem before.  Here's a little test program 
to test the hypothesis that this is where it is failing.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <pwd.h>

main() {
    struct passwd *pw;
    uid_t uid;

    uid = getuid();
    printf("uid = %lu\n", uid);
    
    pw = getpwuid(uid);

    if(!pw) {
	printf("getpwuid(%lu) returned NULL\n", uid);
    }else {
	if(!pw->pw_name)
	    printf("pw->pw_name is NULL\n");
	else
	    printf("You are %s\n", pw->pw_name);
    }
}

I also tried the pre-compiled pine-bin.ultrix and it works fine on the 
same system...

If you can give us some details of exactly what did and did not work, we 
will see if we can help.

Okay...  Have another question regarding PC-Pine.  I've noted that 
PC-Pine correctly picks up all new mail messages when I first fire up 
PC-Pine.  However, all new messages after that point are not picked up by 
PC-Pine and I have to exit PC-Pine and re-enter PC-Pine to see these 
newer messages.  Surely there's an easier way to do this, isn't there?

Thanks!

Stephen

Would command should I execute to build Pine (Sun version) so that it does not
creat the .pine-debug? files in my home directory?

I was successfully able to build it last night but realized when I ran the
binary that it still created those annoying files. 

Last night, I issued the very simple "build sun" and sat back to watch.  My
compliments to the design team for ease of use.

Subject: Problems with HP terminals...
Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1993 22:14:30 -0600
From: Daniel Simmons <simmdan@kenya.isu.edu>

I just grabbed 3.85 and compiled it on my HP 9000/710 running HP-UX 9.01.
Everything seems to work spiffy.

Well, everything that's ever worked, that is.  I have for some time,
experienced a problem using pine and pico with HP terminals.  That is, they
have a propensity for turning on reverse video and then not turning it off. 
For instance, when composing a new message, each header component is
highlighted (reverse video) when the user is supposed to enter that part
(to, subject, etc.).  On HP terminals, though, when you press enter to go
to the next part it gets highlighted but the previous part stays
highlighted as well.  This is particularly annoying when doing something
like selecting a folder--the highlight doesn't move, it just covers
everything.  With the new pico and the ability to mark a region of text the
same problem occurs if you set the mark, move down over some text, and then
move back up--"unmarking" some of it--it all stays marked.  Of course, you
can always hit ctrl-l and redraw the screen correctly, but it is still
frustrating.

I've looked at the code a little bit, but the problem is non-obvious on
first perusal.  I'm willing to go at it, but I thought I might ask for
some overall pointers first.  (For instance, when highlighting is turned
off, does that section of text get redrawn or do you attempt to just tell
the terminal to turn it off or something?)

As a token of my good faith, here's my version of the patch that enables
the keypad on hp terminals.  The old contrib patch didn't apply right to
the new pico/tcap.c, and it didn't cover pine/ttyout.c at all.  So, here's
a small patch that seems to work for both of those files with ver. 3.85.

I'm somewhat confused about what exactly Pine 3.85 can do with news.  I
know the news implementation is somewhat limited at this point, what I'm 
really interested in if I can post to new.  The reason is that I'd like 
to at the same time I send out some FAQs to different mailing lists, I'd 
like  to be able to post them without having to go off and invoke my 
reader and post a second time.

Am I missing something?  (very probably).

Unfortunately, News posting didn't make it into 3.85, but it is 
definitely coming.

What you can do with news in 3.85 is, given a pre-existing newsrc, read news 
groups in the same way that you would read mail folders.  Enhancements to 
make this easier, as well as posting/subscribing/unsubscribing, are high
priorities for us.

(You may have noticed that we have a lot of "high priorities for us"...
 which is why I'm not predicting a release date.)

If you run pine with the argument -d0 it will not make the .pine-debugX 
files.  So you could just create an alias or script called pine that does 
that.  Alternatively, you can rebuild the source.  You need to remove the 
declaration of the DEBUG macro from the makefile in the pine directory.  
So look for the appropriate makefile in the pine subdirectory 
(makefile.sun, I guess, and delete the -DDEBUG from it.  Then do

make -f makefile.sun clean
make -f makefile.sun

in the pine directory to rebuild it.

The design team wasn't able to be here tonight, but I accept your compliments

Edit pine/makefile and remove the "-DDEBUG" flag.  This will remove all 
debug code from Pine.

Thanks for the new patch!  I'll make sure it gets into the next 
maintenance release.

We have seen similar highlighting problems on other systems.  It is kinda
hard for us to deal with HP terminal problems as we do not have any (that I
know of :) around here :(

On Linux systems we found that not all terminal drivers did "the right 
thing" wrt highlighting....

If you have the time and motivation to help us with HP terminal

Ahhh, I missed that fix ;)  Older versions of Pine would create an empty 
.pine-debug with -d0.  Either -d0 or removing -DDEBUG will work, 
depending on how 'permanent' you want the change to be...

Greetings:-

I would like to express my thanks to the Pine Team for incorporating many
substantial improvements and new features into version 3.85. Personally, I
really like the `incoming-folders' and `folder-collections' enhancements -
I was already performing functions related to the latter of these
manually! 

With the ability to now provide one's own name for one's Pine 
addressbook, it's also good to know that global addressbooks are just a 
release (or three :-) away. 

Saving mail from one's inbox by some user-specifiable default strategy is 
also terrific. Would it be possible to do the same for outgoing mail? For 
example, would it be possible to develop a .pinerc option something like 

	Fcc-name-rule=by-recipient

instead of the current 

	sent-mail

One other question: Is is possible to make the rich header option the 
default option when one is composing a message?

In passing, I have successfully built and use Pine version 3.85 on two
Suns,

	SPARC 1+ (SunOS 4.1)

	SPARC 10/30 (SunOS 4.1.3)

where it is enjoyed by our user community :-)

Ian.

From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

Hello,

I'm using a Bull DPX/2 system, running a SVR3.1-based UNIX, including
sockets, TCP/IP, etc.

After getting Pine 3.85, I tried to get it running on my system.
But that's a lot of work...  Copying the OS-dependent files,
and then the trial-and-error when building Pine.

My suggestion is: wouldn't it be better to add proper #ifdef's for
all the system-dependencies in *.[ch] files?  A Configure script also
would be nice, of course ...

I've ported *a lot* of software packages to a lot of UNIX systems,
including the DPX/2 I'm using for Pine now, but I never had to spent
so much time on porting a package ...

Nevertheless, I'll continue, because I think Pine will be a good
alternative for people using UNIX e-mail without being UNIX-users
themselves.

We will be trying to make more frequent releases in the future.  We got 
hung up entirely too long getting PC-pine out the door :-(

Rumor has it "The Boss" has a release schedule planned for the next year 
(or five :-) but we will avoid giving out "expected" release dates for a 
while...

Hmmm...  I can see some merit in having these options...  We will keep 
them in mind...

We feel that the inconvenience of the initial port to a new platform is 
by far outweighed by the ease of maintenance once it is done.  If you 
have the dependencies scattered throughout the code, it can become a 
major nightmare to keep track of what code is doing what very quickly.  

I've done *maintenance* on alot of packages and I can tell you tat it is 
very nice to not have to worry about OS-dependencies when I am trying to 
concentrate on functionality!

Subject: DNS resolving problem
Message-Id: <A8244F92E1967490@UK.AC.CAMBRIDGE.PHOENIX>

We are trying to use the LWP version of pine 385, and find that there is a
problem resolving our DNS addresses.
PC-Pine doesn't appear to handle DNS names which only have CNAME records.
We use CNAMEs to keep the actual location of the IMAP and SMTP services out
of PINERC etc (so that they are aliases of the machines which supply the
service, so we can switch thing around of a machine drops, or for maintenance.
Names which have DNS A-records work fine so I don't think it's a setup problem.

Also, the packet driver version copes with this correctly, so it is specific to
the LWP support.

An urgent fix would be appreciated, as we would like to use the LWP version
for our student service.

Barry,
As you probably know, Alasdair Grant reported this to us yesterday.
We had been assuming that it was an LWP bug, but maybe not...

For the benefit of any LWP experts on the list who might be able to help, 
MikeS sez :

  The library call now doing the work is "rhost()" from the 4.0 toolkit.

Suggestions, anyone?

I don't know if this is related but domain addresses corresponding to CNAME
records are supposed to be canonicalized to hosts with A or MX records:

>From RFC-1123:
          5.2.2  Canonicalization: RFC-821 Section 3.1
     
             The domain names that a Sender-SMTP sends in MAIL and RCPT
             commands MUST have been  "canonicalized," i.e., they must be
             fully-qualified principal names or domain literals, not
             nicknames or domain abbreviations.  A canonicalized name either
             identifies a host directly or is an MX name; it cannot be a
             CNAME.

Well, it appears the problems were in the compiler options.  I reduced
the options to -O -d=const (memory may have lapsed on that last one)
and it compiled.  I dropped the -g3 -Olimit 800 flags, and used gcc
2.45 to compile it.  Aside from a couple of warnings it worked fine.  I
normally have at least one initial problem compiling pine over the past
18 months, but things work out well in the end.

The original build, using ULTRIX 4.1's traditional cc compiler just
died without much complaining.  In any event, we're up and running.

I posted a query last week to the mailing list about a problem with Pine 
dumping core when I quit.

My thanks to all those who responded. The responses indicated that no one 
else had this problem so I've dug a little more.

My working environment on the Sun is X-windows with twm as the window 
manager. If I fire up pine inside an xterm session and quit things are 
fine but I want to have pine as a menu item so in my .twmrc I have the 
following menu item:

	"pine"          !"xterm -title pine -name pine -e pine -i &"

When I quit from this I get the core dump. I can also repeat it if I run 
the command 'xterm -e pine' at the shell prompt.

Using dbx I see:

$ dbx /usr/local/bin/pine core
Reading symbolic information...
Read 31859 symbols

(dbx) where

I'll ask the question again - is this just me or can other people repeat 
this problem?

I'd guess that there's some cleaning up of the terminal going on after 
the xterm has gone away.

My guess would be to write a script called xpine or something and have it 
sleep after pine exits (so the terminal can clean up) and then kill the 
term window...

Later...

	Ever since I got pine 3.07 (and now 3.85) I've started it up 
using an alias that equates to:

	xterm -geom 80x29+75+536 -e pine > /dev/null &

	(Don't remember my logic for the > /dev/null & part..."

	Anyway, it has never dumped core on my MIPS....and I've tried
using your examples and it has not dumped core.  So, I suppose it may
be just your portion of the universe.   :-)

	I'm using the Motif window manager.

I took a stab at making Pine 3.85 compile with GCC 2.4.5 under Solaris, but
didn't get very far before time ran out.  If you get it working, we would be
happy to include your changes though...

Pine is in K&R C (Ahh...purists!)  GCC is ANSI compliant.  To compile K&R 
with GCC you must use the -traditional flag.

Is there a way through the pine.conf configuration file to disable the 
update command?  I've already had some users get confused when they 
stumbled upon this command.  I like the ease of obtaining update files, 
but don't really need this ability for my typical users.

Something I'd like to see in Pine, when you go to select a mail folder 
and hit W to search for a mailbox, as you type in the name of the mailbox 
I'd like it to highlight whatever match it can find from what I've 
entered so far. I don't know about the rest of you but I have about 75 
folders, and it would be real nice to not have to type in the whole name.

For example, mailbox name is hotline.todo

if I enter "hot" and thats the only mailbox with that beginning, it's 
already highlighted and I can enter it right then. Whether it does this 
automatically, or similar to a file completion key (like escape), I think 
that would be a helpful, if small, feature.

Just a suggestion

I am planning to upgrade pine to 3.85, but have been stumped by the new 
mail folders stuff...  This may be due to my not having read the 
documentation, or the effects of prolonged exposure to Sam Adams over the 
weekend (though I'd rather be down the Vic any day, Barry).  Anyway the 
problem I'm creating is that I have all sorts of folders in ~/mail which 
used to show up in Pine 3.07 quite happily when I did a 'G'oto folder, in 
3.85 Pine is seeing the contents of the directory 'cos it gripes about 
not being able to create saved-messages, but when I use L from the main 
menu all I can see is an INBOX in my mail collection.  I have tried 
fiddling about with adding collections to my folder-collections, but to 
no avail...

I get:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder-collection </export/home/io/mike/mail/[]>                         (Local)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             [ ** Empty List **  Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]

when I set my folder-collections to mail/[],~/mail/[], and yet when I list 
the directory they folders are there, and when I try to add an existing 
folder I get the message 

[Can't create folder mail/llnl: folder already exists]

which suggests I'm pointed at the right place.

I'm on a Sun running 4.1.3 with a "better" bind & resolv+2.1, what do I 
have to do to see these mail folders?

Check for a .mailboxlist file.  If pine finds this file, it will assume 
that it is a list of folders.  A couple days before we released 3.85 we 
found out that there are a some programs out there (e.g. XLview) that 
create empty .mailboxlist files that trip us up.  The workaround for now 
is to delete or rename the .mailboxlist file.

I would like to suggest that in the future there should be an option to build to
specify a default destination directory other than /usr/local....  Yes, I know
you can edit the source, but I think enough people out there would be interested
in this to make it a little more convenient.

I encountered the same problem that Mike describes. Something had created 
a .mailboxlist list in my home directory. After I removed this file, the 
folders showed up in the folder list as expected.

Hi.  I'm having very similar problems.  I've seen it on pine 3.05,
3.07, and now 3.85.  i've seen it happen at different places.  First,
We have a NeXT running NeXTstep 3.0, If we use console to run pine in
the NeXT, it works fine.  If we use MacNCSA Telnet 2.5/2.6 to telnet to
the next, we get the ^J mapping thing.  It only happens when within
PINE or PICO.  If I use an alternate editor (vi), it works fine.

The second place I see it is on my NetBSD-0.8 box.  It's the same
circumstances when using NCSA telnet for mac.  If i telnet directly to the
NetBSD macine, I get the ^J thing.  If i use NCSA to telnet to a sun pine
works fine, and if i telnet to my netbsd box, it works fine then too.
i'm confused.

This problem is a bug in the telnetd that ships with NeXTSTEP.  A newer 
version of the telnetd will fix the problem under NeXTSTEP 2.x, but under 
3.x, it will not.  You can try adding the line:

	stty -extproc

to the .login or /etc/login.std.  This fixes the bug under 3.x, and 
should work under 2.x as well.

I did just that and it 'solves' the problem.
e.g.

My menu item now reads:

	"pine"          !"xterm -title pine -name pine -e mypine -i &"

where 'mypine' looks like:
--
#!/bin/sh

pine $*
sleep 1
--

I still think that this feature is a bug!

This problem is due to a bug in the very old version of the BSD Unix Telnet
server that NeXT runs.  As of NEXTSTEP 3.1, this problem is still not fixed.

On ftp.cac.washington.edu, the file next/telnetd-for-3.0 contains a more
modern version of telnetd that fixes this problem for NEXTSTEP 3.0 systems.  I
built it from vanilla BSD sources, which are readily available over the net
from a number of ftp services.

Use the following procedure to install it:
	% ftp ftp.cac.washington.edu
	Name: anonymous
	Password: foo
	ftp> binary
	ftp> cd next
	ftp> get telnetd-for-3.0
	ftp> quit
	% chmod +x telnetd-for-3.0
	% su
	Password:
	# mv /usr/etc/telnetd /usr/etc/telnetd.old
	# mv telnetd-for-3.0 /usr/etc/telnetd

Unfortunately, it appears that NeXT broke the TTY driver in NEXTSTEP 3.1, so
this fixed telnetd does not work.  I tried recompiling under 3.1, but it still
doesn't work.  Since NeXT doesn't supply sources, I'm clueless on how to help
for 3.1, other than ``don't run 3.1 if you care about a working Telnet
server.''

If you can configure your Telnet client to send CR NUL instead of CR LF when
the RETURN key is hit, that will work around the problem.  Unfortunately, it
also means that you must type CTRL/J after the user name and password when you
log in instead of RETURN.

Folks...

I love pine and try to convert all users to it...It is very 
cool...However, I've found a little annoyance with the new pine that is 
documented in the man pages to work...I have yet to be able to specify an 
address on the command line...I get spit into the main menu and am told 
that "4 is an unrecognized command"...something like that.  Any ideas?

Later...

	Hummm....it works fine for me.

	Can you give a few more details of you set up?  OS, hardware,
terminal type, etc.?

	I'm running pine 3.85 on a MIPS platform.

Mike,
Jason has confirmed to me that he indeed does have Pine aliased with -i.

Folks: we've been bit by the law of unintended consequences again,
which is a polite way of saying we failed to think about the interaction
of the new keystroke list option with existing aliases that included -i.
Sorry about that... We'll be discussing today what, if anything, might be 
reasonable to do about this.  (In retrospect, I would vote for the new
keystroke list to be -I in caps, and leave -i alone.  Command line 
options are the one place in Pine where we've allowed input to be 
case-sensitive.)

Maria,
Is the "image-viewer=" variable set correctly in your .pinerc, or in
the system-wide pine.conf file?

It should specify the path of a suitable program such as xloadimage or xv.

This is one that has hit us too.   In the past the department concerned 
had advised its users to have an alias for "pine" that did "pine -iz". 
Yesterday, they rang up to moan that this was causing problems.  They 
also include a departmental bin dirtectory in the search path, and so I 
suggested they include in that directory a shell script called pine that 
does:
   if parameter is -iz
      then
         echo change your pine alias to "pine -z -i"
      else
         exec /usr/local/share/bin/pine $*
   endif
[The file /usr/local/share/bin/pine is the place where the executable for 
pine is located.]  Agreed that it's tortuous, but hopefully it is solving 
their problem.

I haven't given any thought as to what I would suggest for the next 
release of Pine.

My previous message stands about this problem for 3.1.  I had tried 
recompiling the telnetd that Mark is talking about, but it is definitely 
broken under NeXTSTEP 3.1.

If you add an obscure, undocumented command to your .login, or to 
/etc/login.std, this problem with the CTRL-J will go away.  Believe me, 
it works.  We have more than 40 NeXTSTEP machines that this is working on.

The CTRL-J problem is not just limited to Pine or Pico, either.  Try 
using tin, rn, or any other vt-100 oriented program.

Again, if you add the following to your .login, it will fix the problem:

	stty -extproc

-jason

I believe "pine -zi" works fine.  "pine -iz" does not.

Does anyone know of a DOS TSR that could periodically poll a UNIX mail 
server running IMAPD for new mail over a TCP/IP network and announce the
new mail?

HP 9000/433 68040-50 HP-UX 9.01 X11R5, I usually run from an x-terminal, 
but it happens to matter what term type I use.  Pine is aliased:

alias pine -z -i 

It worked with the older versions...

Hi.  I've got 2 questions...first with pine 3.85, when I save messages to 
folders, they get re-marked as new...even if it was read and/or answered 
before i saved it.  Is this a bug or a feature?

Second I thought that pine would get the folder lock from another pine 
process.  When I run pine, then suspend it, then run pine again, it chews 
on the lock process for a while, then it says that it's read only, and 
the original session gets the write access taken away....hence 2 pine 
sessions with no write capaability.  

just wondering....

If you can tell me where pine parses it's command-line I'll make the hack 
and edit our local man pages...

I have mine running as 'pine -i -z' and it works just as it always has.  
But I agree, the initial keystroke list should use -I or some other 
identifier to avoid confusion.

When typing in a local user name in the To: (or Cc:) field followed by
carrage-return, Pine will retype the line with only the fully qualified
domain name and NOT include the user's real name obtained from the passwd's 
gcos-field.
For example:
     To: adams            ==>  To: adams@smc.com
Since my machine does not have a fully qualified domain name in the
hosts file, the pine variable "user-domain" was set to "smc.com".

I noticed that if the "user-domain" is set to "". Then the user's
real name is included BUT I DO NOT GET THE FULL DOMAIN NAME (only
the local machine name that I am on).
For example:
     To: adams            ==>   To: Tom Adams <adams@myworkstation>

What I really would like is both the local user's real name and
a fully qualified domain name (without the local machine name)
and not touch my /etc/hosts file.
For example:
     To: adams            ==>   To: Tom Adams <adams@smc.com>

(I assume the above is what is normally expected when the machine
is fully qualified in the /etc/hosts file.)

How do I set up pine's local variables to do this?

Here is a context diff to change the behavior of the -i flag in pine3.85. 
This fix changes -i back to its old behavior.  That is, -i means start in
the index and -i doesn't take any arguments.  There is a new flag, -I,
which requires an argument.  The argument is a comma-separated list of
initial keystrokes. 

An alternative workaround to the problem of -i causing unexpected 
failures in aliases is to have another flag come after the -i.  That is,
pine -i -z will always work correctly.  Pine -iz will never work 
correctly, and pine -zi will not work correctly if the alias is invoked 
with arguments.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

I have recently installed Pine 3.85 on one of our RS6000's and things 
went very smoothly... World of difference from 3.07...  Anyways, I was 
kind of surprised that pine doesn't use the mailcap file in order to 
determine how to handle MIME.  How difficult would it be to incorporate?  
Also, is is possible for Pine to handle Postscript documents (ie: pass 
them on to Ghostview?)

We did not have time to get mailcap into 3.85, but we plan to include it 
into 4.0.  Pine will recognize a Postscript attachment and label it 
appropriately on outgoing mail, but it currently does not know how to 
call a PS viewer.  All this will come with mailcap...

This is a lack of feature.  You can call it a bug if you like.  The fix will
be to write the code to preserve flags.  This will be done in a future
version.

That's unfortunately correct.  The second Pine cannot steal the folder lock
without the first Pine's consent, but if the first Pine is suspended it cannot
give that consent.  Unfortunately, when it gets resumed, the lock-steal
request hits, with the results you note.

The workaround, at least for the time being, is not to do this.  :-)

Does anyone know if Pine is available for VAX systems? Also, if anyone is using
a nice email similar to Pine on a VAX system I would like to know. I do know about All-in-one but thats about it. Thanks.

Is it possible to get Pine to deal with:

  [Part 1, "Text_1"  Unknown text "IBM437"  3 lines]
  [Can not display this part. Use the "A" command to save in a file]

We are bringing up a PMDF/cc:Mail gateway that apparently puts text into this
charset.

There are unsubstantiated rumors of a VMS(Posix) port of Pine floating 
around, but we have not seen it...

I have small problem with pine in hpux.
In /usr/local/lib/pine.conf I have following line:
	folder-collections=Mail/[]

'Folder list' uses correctly Mail-directory, but if I look system
configuration with pine -conf here is what pine says: 
	folder-collections=@,

I'm using pine in hp9000/7xx machines.
In SunOS 4.1.3 it seems to work.

The latest (3.85) version of Pine will go ahead and display the message 
with a warning.  Since IBM437 is not part of the MIME standard, we would 
strongly suggest that this behavior be changed if at all possible.

1)  I am getting the following errors after typing the username and password and
before I enter the index.  I thought it was an indication of junk in my
.addressbook, but it is not.  The messages go away as soon as I hit a key to go
into the index. 

   ...first...
[{develop}inbox : [PARSE] Must use comma to separate addresses: faculty;@faculty]
   ...and then...
[{develop}inbox : [PARSE] Junk at end of address: ::"ekurgpol@law.usc.edu"@sutr>]

2)  Why isn't there a way to move one word backwards at time?  In other words,
the opposite of ^[SPACE] ?  And by the way, thanks for the feature!

3)  While I'm at it, if someone wants to save me some time and tell me if there is
an option to disable the bell in pine, that would be nice.

It is possible, but the right thing to do is to make the gateway use MIME
as the RFCs say.  Code page 437 is not a MIME character set, and only
boneheads think every other machine should support machine X's character
set - even if it's a sane charater set, and code page 437 is isn't: It can
do some very naughty things if a 7-bit program uses it.

Sorry I'm grumpy, I'm too tired and anyway that gateway deserves flamage.

These [PARSE] messages are routine.  They do not indicate any problems in your
.addressbook or your configuration.  They *do* indicate problems in the
headers of one or more of the messages in your mailbox.  Since there is no way
anyone can control what sort of garbage gets deposited in your mailbox, it's
pretty much routine to see [PARSE] messages.

The sole purpose that these messages is that Pine's parser is alerting you to
the fact that it saw something that was invalid under the RFC-822 or MIME
standards.  It's done some error recovery, which generally involves tossing
out whatever confused it.  When the offending message is displayed in Pine,
the display may surprise you if you weren't alerted to the possibility of a
problem.  For example,
	To: All the Gang
would probably show up as:
	To: All@Law.USC.EDU
and a complaint generated about `` the Gang'' being a non-comma separated
address.

The [PARSE] token is a key to the Pine main program from the parser that it
may want to suppress these messages as ``babble''. I don't think Pine keys on
it yet.  In the future, the parser will offer better communication to Pine so
that the offending message can be flagged as having had a problem.  Presently,
it gives a set of [PARSE] messages without an indication of what caused it;
the parser presently has no idea about ``message numbers'' and just parses
strings that are spoon-fed to it.

Of course, in a perfect world, people won't run mail programs that compose
invalid RFC-822/MIME, and you would never see such messages.  People who
believe in perfect worlds also believe in UFOs, the Easter Bunny, and the
triumphant arrival of the SS Titanic in New York Harbor....  :-)

I hate to have to be so heavy-handed here, but you're simply dead wrong on
this. IBM437 is defined in RFC1345. That takes care of the sanity and
definition issues completely. And all character sets in RFC1345 are registered
for use in conjunction with MIME -- see RFC1340 for the *official* IANA list.

I happen to think that registering absolutely all the charcter sets in RFC1345
was a mistake, since some of them are not adequately defined to be used in an
interoperable fashion. But nobody asked me and IANA did in fact register them
all for use with MIME. (If you think that IANA doesn't have the necessary
authority you need to reread RFC1341 or RFC1521 for a reality check on this 
point.)

IBM437 is one character set that is adequately defined, in my opinion. If you
have a problem with this definition, you should be discussing it with the Keld
Simonsen (author of RFC1345). You can do this either directly or you might want
to consider the ietf-charsets working group
(ietf-charsets-request@innosoft.com) for this purpose.

I also think that releasing IBM437 stuff on the Internet is something to be
avoided if at all possible. However, the gateway at issue contains very
complete facilities for handling character set conversions and is quite capable
of converting IBM437 into whatever character set is appropriate. This can be
done seamlessly, efficiently, and automatically. The difficulty lies in picking
an appropriate character set to convert IBM437 to: depending on local usage
there are several possible character sets it might make sense to use as a
target. (All things being equal I'd probably pick ISO-8859-1 myself.)

Once you pick something setting up conversions is trivial -- the point is that
the local administrator does have to pick something and configure accordingly.
And in case you didn't notice, the administrator in question here is in the
very early stages of both setting up the gateway *and* getting Pine going. It
is therefore quite reasonable for him to ask about this in multiple forums to
see what the best approach is. You should not assume that just because things
are working in a particular way now that they will stay that way.

But in the absence of proper configuration information the gateway has no
choice but to operate in a loss-less and completely standards-compliant
fashion, which in turn means that IBM437 stuff is produced.

As for Pine's actions in this case, I have no problem with them either. A user
agent should be able to pick and choose what character sets it supports, and if
it wants to make it hard or impossible to use IBM437 directly that's fine. The
issue here isn't one of standardized use versus nonstandardized use -- it is
entirely within Pine's purview to do whatever it likes with the material
presented to it, just as it is entirely within the gateway's purview to produce
IBM437 character set labels.

> Sorry I'm grumpy, I'm too tired and anyway that gateway deserves flamage.

Grumpy or not, before you flame like this you need to learn to distinguish
between what the standards actually say and what you'd like them to say. I
don't particularly like what they say in this area either but that doesn't
change matters. And while you're at it you might also want to consider the
difference between bad design and bad initial configuration.

Ned -

     Please enlighten me.  I'll be the first to admit that I may be wrong, but
here is how I see it:

     RFC-1345 character sets are undeniably listed in RFC-1340, and the IANA
has undeniable authority to register MIME character sets.

     But I see nothing in RFC-1340 that indicates that RFC-1345 character sets
are registered for use in MIME.  In fact, I see an entirely separate list of
character sets registered for MIME on the previous page of RFC-1340.

     As far as I know, RFC-1340 registers RFC-1345 character sets as
registered character sets.  I don't think that that says that they are
registered MIME character sets, particularly as RFC-1340 has a separate list
of registered MIME character sets.

     Damned if I know what use a list of registered character sets might have
if it isn't for MIME, but that's how I interpret the situation.

Stephen,
We believe this to be a characteristic of the VMS (PMDF) IMAP server you 
are connecting to, but are CC'ing the folks at Innosoft for comment.

(New mail notification is supported in UW's Unix IMAP server.)

Using PC-Pine 3.85 isn't bad, but I do have a few questions:

1. How do I get Pine to "re-fresh" the INBOX?  What I mean is that new 
incoming mail that come in after I have fired up PC-Pine is not being 
seen unless I exit Pine altogether and then fire it up again.

2. What kind of encryption does PC-Pine use to send binaries?  I note 
that I cannot accept all binaries sent to me -- so I want to know what my 
options are, and how to instruct others on how to encrypt their binaries 
to be sent to me.

Thanks!

This is apparently only a problem if you are using Innosoft's VMS-based IMAP
server.  Other IMAP servers will automatically ``refresh'' without any action
on your part.

There is nothing that PC-Pine can do about this.  Innosoft is aware of the
problem in their software, but they don't have a solution yet.

The only thing I can suggest is to set up a UNIX system as an IMAP server
instead of VMS.

PC-Pine does not use ``encryption'' per se.  It uses the BASE64 encoding of
the MIME Draft Standard (RFC-1521).  So, you should be able to receive
binaries sent from a MIME-compliant mailer.

X-To:       pine-announce@cac.washington.edu

Folks,
We've learned of several problems in 3.85 that you should be aware of...

 1. Backspace/delete in, or after, spell-checking a message sometimes
    makes the message evaporate, or turn into garbage, or Pine to crash.

 2. The new meaning of the -i flag breaks some aliases.  We will revert to 
    old semantics of -i, and add -I for the new keystroke list.

 3. Feature-list options in the global pine.conf file (e.g.
    enable-goto-cmd) are nullified by defining *any* feature-list entries
    in one's personal .pinerc.  We will fix this by making global and
    personal feature lists additive, and will provide a way to negate
    globally-set features. 

 4. A message with a null To: field will cause Pine to crash.

 5. The new "Can't delete open folder" policy is causing chagrin.
    We will revert to the old policy.


All of these (and more!) will be fixed in 3.86... a maintenance release
planned for next week. In the meantime, a diff for the -i command line
conflict has already been posted to the pine-info list, and we expect to 
post a diff for the spell-check bug soon.

As always, apologies for any difficulties these bugs may have caused.

-teg

p.s.  As you all know by now :) the goto command was made optional in 
Pine 3.85, for the reasons mentioned in the release notes.  We assumed,
perhaps incorrectly, that the pine users who had discovered and come
to love Goto in previous versions were typically power users, and a 
small percentage of the total population.  We'd love to have feedback
on whether the new (option-enabled) Goto is OK, or whether you would
prefer to see it always enabled.

If the character sets are not registered for use with MIME, what precisely are
they registered for? You must answer this question before such an indication
would be either necessary or meaningful. The only reasonable interpretation of
the lack of any indication in the document as to the registration status as
meaning everything has the same status.

There is only one character set registry at present. This registry is for use
with MIME. Nobody else has ever set one up -- there are plenty of things that
might make use of a such a registry besides MIME, but to my knowledge none of
them have done anything formal with IANA.

As such, character sets are either registered or they are not -- they don't
have a "status" associated with them and they don't have a "recommended use"
associated with them.

As a matter of fact, this is probably the wrong place to do this. Any
registered character set should be legal for use in MIME. But MIME is being
used for lots of things besides email now. What needs to happen is a profile of
the proper character sets for use in MIME-based email (as opposed to netnews,
local clipboard formats, world-wide-web, etc. etc. etc. which may need to make
completely different choices). RFC1502 provides an example of a similar profile
for the X.400 community --  read it and you'll find that they blew it in ways
we never even dreamed of!

>      As far as I know, RFC-1340 registers RFC-1345 character sets as

What is a "registered character set" if it isn't for use with MIME? The
separation of the lists is an artefact of the separate sources involved as far
as I can tell, and that's all it is.

>      Damned if I know what use a list of registered character sets might have

Precisely! And please note: I DO NOT LIKE ANY OF THIS THIS. I think it is
terrible, confusing, and we have well and truly opened the pandora's box we
tried so hard to contain in the IETF-822 working group. And it was done without
our knowledge or consent and pretty much in direct contradiction to the
consensus reached in the working group. But hating it and getting angry about
it don't change it. What I am trying to do is pursue this through the means
available to me -- the Character Set Working Group and the Application Area
Directorate, and see if we cannot make some sense out of all this chaos. I must
confess, however, that the current imbroglio involving MIME content subtype
registration is a bigger concern of mine, and I'm spending much more time in
that area than on character sets.

Finally, it is vital to keep in mind that this all becomes moot once the
gateway is properly configured. As such, this is all academic insofar as the
present situation is concerned.

Nevertheless, it is far from academic in that other software will undoubtedly
start using character sets off the registered list, and is in fact entirely
justified in doing so until and unless we get a email-specific profile in
place. This is especially true since there are any number of people going
around saying that not only is everything in RFC1340 of completely equal
status, that therefore I should have every expectation of, say, T.61 working
just as well as US-ASCII. Not!

We've recently fixed a bug in pine's composer that could cause pine 3.85
to crash after spell-checking a composition.  At best, the problem caused
random junk to get appended to outgoing messages after a spell-check. 
Either way, it's quite annoying. 

Attached is a context diff for the fix that will be included in the
upcoming pine 3.86 maintenance release.  Apologies for any problems this
bug may have caused!

I don't think IBM437 is "MIME-compliant".  I'd fix the problem at the
source and use PMDF's character conversion channel to modify the character
set on the fly - unless it disturbs your cc:mail users.

Subject: Extracting 'dead' attachments

Hello
Since the VAX mailer cannot forward MIME attachments nor can it read them I
wondered if someone has a simple program to decode the extracted attachments.
I guess there are a lot of people who have VAX/VMS accounts who will be facing
a similar problem as MIME attachments increase in popularity and a VAX port
of pine seems as far away as ever.
Thanks
Neil

Of course I regret what I yesterday - my brain is awake now and properly
functioning.  I'd like to apologise, and to quote some RFCs:

RFC1341, on character set use in MINE:

            NOTE:   Beyond  US-ASCII,  an  enormous   proliferation   of
            character  sets  is  possible. It is the opinion of the IETF
            working group that a large number of character sets is NOT a
            good  thing.   We would prefer to specify a single character
            set that can be used universally for representing all of the
            world's   languages   in  electronic  mail.   Unfortunately,
            existing practice in several communities seems to  point  to
            the  continued  use  of  multiple character sets in the near
            future.  For this reason, we define names for a small number
            of  character  sets  for  which  a  strong  constituent base
            exists.    It is our hope  that  ISO  10646  or  some  other
            effort  will  eventually define a single world character set
            which can then be specified for use in Internet mail, but in
            the  advance of that definition we cannot specify the use of
            ISO  10646,  Unicode,  or  any  other  character  set  whose
            definition is, as of this writing, incomplete.

            The defined charset values are:

                 US-ASCII -- as defined in [US-ASCII].

                 ISO-8859-X -- where "X"  is  to  be  replaced,  as
                      necessary,  for  the  parts of ISO-8859 [ISO-
                      8859].  Note that the ISO 646 character  sets
                      have  deliberately  been  omitted in favor of
                      their  8859  replacements,  which   are   the
                      designated  character sets for Internet mail.
                      As of the publication of this  document,  the
                      legitimate  values  for  "X" are the digits 1
                      through 9.

            Note that the character set used,  if  anything  other  than
            US-ASCII,   must  always  be  explicitly  specified  in  the
            Content-Type field.

            No other character set name may be  used  in  Internet  mail
            without  the  publication  of a formal specification and its
            registration with IANA as described in  Appendix  F,  or  by
            private agreement, in which case the character set name must
            begin with "X-".

            Implementors are discouraged  from  defining  new  character
            sets for mail use unless absolutely necessary.

RFC1345, about itself:

Status of the Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is
   unlimited.

Summary

   This memo lists a selection of characters and their presence in some
   coded character sets.

So I apologise for tone, but I'm not sure whether I should apologise for
the content of my message.

Although VMS Mail (a *very* out-dated mail system that DEC should seriously
think about revamping!) cannot handle MIME, we have found that Innosoft's PMDF
MAIL product can.  I am hoping that Innosoft might someday beef this product up
with a menu interface comparable to Elm or Pine or Gold Mail.

PMDF also provides a IMAP2 server; however, there is a small glitch in its
IMAP services -- while in Pine, it doesn't concurrently update your 'inbox' for
new mail messages.  You must exit and re-enter Pine to read new NEWMAIL --
which sort of makes DIR/NEW comparatively more attractive. :-{ 

I am happy with PMDF, but like everything else -- there's always room for
improvment! :-)   I should add that if you are within a university setting,
their educational rates are fairly reasonable and affordable (however, I don't
know how this would translate outside the U.S.).

When you mark text for deletion, and hit ctrl-x, the editing mark will be 
lost and pine or pico will exit.. Could this be changed so that when you 
mark something and (inadvertantly) hit an exit key, it'll say something

	I notice that when I use pine 3.85 to view attachments that the 
first attachment is always the main body of the mail message. Actual 
attachments are always the second or greater attachment. Is this the 
intent of the pine design or a bug? 

	Bye the way - thanks for pine. My son told me about it and it is 
great! I am medically limited to working at home and without pine my life 
would be much more difficult.

Has someone got a fix for the Mac NCSA Telnet problem with ^J ?  It's been
making us crazy here.  I actually modified Pico/Pine to avoid ^J as a
command but that'll be annoying to do with each release.  If I can install
a standard 3.85 I'd be happy.

I was wondering if there's a good termainal emulation package which runs 
under Windows on a PC which allows the ansi printing escapes to be used 
in an "intuitive" way.  Currently a user of mine uses the Windows Term 
program, but can't seem to make printing work...

I don't have a PC to hand, and the user is connected via a 2400bps modem 
to a service which eventually sprouts him into my computer as a telnet 
connection.  He is emulating a VT100, any helpful hints about how to get 
a pine message printed to a file on his PC would be able to get captured 
to a file or sent to the normal Windows printing system.

Sorry if this is more of a Windows than Pine question, 3.85 is pretty 
neat, thanks.

Mike

  Pine will let you send mail with no "to:" field, causing bad things to 
happen  and postmaster to get mail.  Is there a way to make pine check to 
be sure there is a non-null to: field before sending mail?

I was just recently working on this problem. Im not too sure about the
software you are using, but if it is a VT100 emulator on a PC I was 
successful in printing files directly to the printer by sending an escape
sequence to pipe it to lpt1 and then sending another to stop it. Here
is the program:

dosprint

  echo 'Printing.. Please wait.'
  pr -f -l64 $1 > ~/.prx
  echo '<esc>[5i'
  cat ~/.prx
  echo '<esc>[4i'
  \rm ~/.prx

(replace <esc> with the escape key) 

Its not elegant, and I couldve probably piped the pr through the cat, but
this works for DOS machines. I tested it on PCs running Procomm via asynch
and also on LanWorkPlace for DOS's tnvt220 via ethernet and was successful
in printing it to lasers/dotmatrix/deskwriters. (you can change the pr 
parameters to your preference) 

As far as printing directly to a file, I havent tried this yet, but there
are utility programs out there (wuarchive?) that redirects anything sent
to lpt1 to a file. Course, that would mean starting that utility BEFORE
you enter your comm program and that EVERYTHING sent to the printer would
be sent to that file.

Crosstalk for Windows works, as well as Procomm+ for Windows.  If you're 
looking for shareware, look for WinQVT.  I've used all three and they all 
work great...

Later...

You didn't indicate which operating system you were using, so I thought I would
provide a VMS solution as well:

Hi -

I share your frustration with this problem, being someone who personally
experiences it daily.  Fortunately, there are several forms of attack to this
problem:

Attack #1: Avoid CTRL/J in Pine and Pico as you have done.
 Pros:	Fixes it in Pine.
 Cons:	Doesn't solve the general problem.

Attack #2: In your NCSA config.tel file, add the line
	crmap=4.3BSDCRNUL	# map return key to CR/NUL instead of CR/LF
 Pros:	The official BSD UNIX hacker's workaround.  Works for all systems
	which have the broken BSD telnetd, and doesn't require cooperation on
	the part of those systems to fix it.
 Cons:	A dreadful kludge against the intent of newline handling in the Telnet
	protocol.  You have to login in using CTRL/J instead of return (that
	is, I have to type mrc<CTRL/J> instead of mrc<RETURN> to the login:
	prompt, and ditto for the password prompt.  Then RETURN works right).

Attack #3: For NEXTSTEP 2.x and 3.0 *ONLY*, acquire a copy of vanilla BSD
	telnetd source (available from several sources) and rebuild telnetd.
	The broken version of telnetd distributed by NeXT is 5.45 (6/28/90).
	The fixed version is 5.48 (3/1/91) or later.  A binary for 3.0 is on
	ftp.cac.washington.edu in the next/ directory.
 Pros:	The correct fix for the bug.
 Cons:	Can't do it on NEXTSTEP 3.1, for unknown reasons.

Attack #4: It is claimed by reliable sources that ``stty -extproc'' in the
	user's .login file will work around this problem as well.
 Pros:	Works with NEXTSTEP 3.1
 Cons:	I haven't personally verified to see if there are any undesirable
	side effects.

There are other strategies, but the four that I've listed above are likely to
be the only productive ones.  On the other hand, bopping certain vendors on
the head with a sledgehammer on the head *is* emotionally satisfying after
experiencing this infuriating bug...

Yeah, well... for idiots like me who hit ctrl-x instead of ctrl-k... 
Plus, this prompt wouldn't appear for mildly intelligent people (i.e. I'd 
see it alot)....  It'd just appear if you screw up (or if you meant to

I think this is the best. We have similar problems with SGI's xwsh
terminal-program: when doing X cut&paste I either paste into xwsh or copy
from xwsh and paste into xterm (or whatever) the pasted text has ^J as
end-of-line character instead of ^M. This makes cut&past impossible
to use with pine.

A way (hack :-) might be to add a configuration parameter (yes, one more)
like =


# fill-command defines the control chacter used to fill paragraphs
# the default value is 11 (^J), 0 means fill no in use =

fill-command=3D

The problems with this are
	- screen-menu shows ^J as fill (runtime change)
	- help file has wrong key (must edit help-file)

Neither of these are serious because when a user changes this he should
now what the fill command is.

I just looked and found a problem with this. There are few free keys. I
think ^W and ^] are about the only unused ones. A way around this would me=
 to
make some key (like ^X) a prefix-key and make some seldom-used
functions two-key commands. I can suggest several like spell (^X^S),
read (^X^R), postpone (^X^P), send (^X^C),... . If pressing the prefix
(^X) changes the menu at the bottom of the screen tit isn't much harder
to use that pine/pico now are (and most people need to know emacs anyway).

Let me take these points in reverse order and begin by repeating something I
said in private mail: The fact that RFC1345 is informational is itself
meaningless. There is no requirement that character sets designated for MIME
use be described by standards-track documents. If anything, the intention is
precisely the opposite -- a standards-track document defining character sets
would effectively put the IETF in the character set business for itself. We
(speaking as an IETF member here) do not want to be in this business! There are
two many people defining character sets already!

This is also borne out by actual RFCs as well. RFC1489 defines a Cyrillic
character set, RFC1456 defines VISCII (for Vietnamese), and RFC1468 defines
ISO-2022-JP (for Japanese). There are also at least four other documents of
this sort that will be published as RFCs in the near future. These character
sets are specifically intended for use with MIME and were/will be approved for
such use at the time of their publication. And *all* of these documents are
informational RFCs.

RFC1345 differs in that it defins a mnemonic encoding as well as describing
existing usage. But if anything its status is even more assured -- the
character sets it documents are in the latest assigned numbers RFC: RFC1340!

In the final analysis you really cannot have it both ways. Either publication
as an informational RFC is sufficient or it is not. If it is RFC1345 defines
character sets for use with MIME. If it is not none of the others (ISO-2022-JP,
VISII, etc.) are allowed in MIME messages either. And if this is true why on
earth were these documents published?

Now let's return to the language in RFC1341, some of which I wrote. RFC1341 is,
to put it in the most charitable terms possible, naive. I still believe that a
proliferation of character sets is a bad thing. I still hope for the One True
Character Set to come and rescue us all from all this character set dementia.
But I've largely given up hope -- we've yet to satisfactorily determine how to
transmit either ISO10646, let alone its BMP subset, in MIME, and even if we
licked this problem today we'd still have issues with various communities whose
needs are *not* met by ISO10646.

However, regardless of how I feel we have to distinguish between fact and
wishful thinking when it comes to labelling things as illegal. RFC1340
registered the RFC1345 character sets. You can argue that this was a bad idea
(it was). You can argue that this was done contrary to the wishes of the
IETF-822 working group (it was). You can argue that just because something is
allowed is no reason to do it (it isn't). You can argue that we need to do
something about it NOW (I've, along with John Klensin, have been trying for
over a year). But the fact remains that an implementor, starting with the RFC
index and without any other information, would rapidly come to the conclusion
that RFC1340 contains the list of permitted character sets and that the ones in
RFC1345 are legal. Making a case that usage out of RFC1345 is illegal requires
a lot of twisting and turning that simply cannot be part of determining whether
or not something is standards-compliant.

My position here is an awkward one and I admit it. I freely admit that I don't
approve of open use of IBM437 or any of the other character sets in RFC1345.
But I cannot accept assertions that such usage is illegal. To do so would mean,
among other things, that I think that the present situation is tolerable. And I
don't think it is.

I have also had second thoughts about what I said about Pine supporting or not
supporting character sets outside of the list in RFC1341 (or RFC1521). Let me
use a somewhat different example to make my point -- we've picked on poor old
IBM437 enough now.

I mostly use VMS machines. VMS machines use a character set called (in RFC1345
parlance) DEC-MCS. VT200 and VT300 terminals use DEC-MCS as their native
character set as well.

The mail utility on VMS, VMS MAIL, is quite popular. (We provide a replacement
for it that works a lot better, but it would be foolish for me to think that
VMS MAIL usage is disappearing because of this.) It provides native support for
DEC-MCS and all messages are assumed to be in DEC-MCS. This leads to
interesting issues when things like IMAP or POP servers and/or Pine clients are
installed/served from a VMS machine.

We commonly use a simple trick to eliminate most of the problems. DEC-MCS is
quite close to ISO-8859-1: it has things like an OE-ligature while ISO-8859-1
doesn't, but there are only 8 differences of this sort. This means that most of
the time pretending DEC-MCS is the same as ISO-8859-1 is an acceptable
solution. We do this whenever and whereever it is feasible to do so.

But there are sites where the 8 different characters do matter and where this
trick won't work well enough to depend on. We cannot change the fact that
people's mailboxes are in DEC-MCS format, so we convert incoming mail into this
character set whenever it makes sense to do so. And of course we label the
message accordingly. And when mail is sent off-site it is converted into
ISO-8859-1 (or whatever is appropriate) as it goes out.

But what does the IMAP server and the Pine client do? You get errors, that's
what. So now we're back to the same set of issues -- should Pine have to deal
with stuff like DEC-MCS directly? You say no, such usage is just as illegal in
this case as it was with IBM437.

But there's a very important difference here. This usage is entirely local. The
usage on the network is completely in compliance with RFC1341. This is a local
matter. And it is axiomatic that local matters are just that: local and not
subject to standardization. (Getting POP and IMAP on the standards track was
a major challenge because of this axiom. Only the fact that either one can
be used on the real Internet made it possible to standardize these protocols.)

One possible solution is for the IMAP server to do this conversion. (This is
what we'll probably implement if need be.) But this involves information loss,
and if the information loss was important enough to make labelling DEC-MCS as
ISO-8859-1 infeasible, it probably means that converting to make Pine happy is
not acceptable either.

The point I'm trying to make here is that Pine, like any MUA, is subject to
requirements and needs that lie outside the realm of standardization. For
example, Pine and IMAP contains support to read UNIX mailboxes in a variety of
different formats. You will not find these formats documented in any RFCs, nor
will you find people arguing that because these formats are not documented in a
standards-track RFC that Pine has no business supporting them.

I am not arguing that Pine should support either IBM437 or DEC-MCS -- this is a
bridge we'll cross when someone has a real need and documents that need. All
I'm saying is that even if it were true that use of such character sets is
illegal on the Internet, this would not in and of itself eliminate any chance
of needing support for them in Pine.

Would it be useful to conduct the pine-info discussion on a newsgroup 
rather than via mailing list?  (Heresy?)  I might want to suggest to a 
colleague that they look at a message (article) which I have deleted.
With the mailing list, it's gone; with a newsgroup, it's available
(at least for a while).  -mr

One additional note. I Bcc'ed a bunch of this discussion to John Klensin, who
is the co-director of the Application Area of the IETF/IESG. John is also the
specific person who most often oversees character set issues in the IETF (poor
guy!). Here is his response (extracted from a list of bullets sent in response
to several things I'd asked him, but nevertheless quoted in its entirety):

   -- The 822 WG set up a registration procedure.  I haven't been happy about
  the charset aspect of it from day 1, which clearly hasn't been a secret.
  But that procedure made it into a Proposed Standard, Keld followed it and
  registered a bunch of stuff with IANA.  IANA followed it and accepted the
  registrations.  So your users aren't using "something from 1345", they
  are using something from the IANA-maintained registration list, which is
  perfectly valid (however stupid it may also be).
  
(John gave me permission to quote him as well.) Now, I suppose we could ask for
a full IESG ruling on this issue, but it would only make a lot of busy people
needlessly busier, and, assuming they would bother, would probably produce
exactly the same opinion.

In other words, this is as official as it is likely to get. Use of RFC1345
character sets in MIME messages is legal. Stupid, but legal. The only real
issue here is how we want to deal with the unfortunate situation that's
developed.

It would also, in my opinion, be a better place for discussion on
topics such as the recent character sets/standards thread.  While
interesting to some, this line of discussion, in its present form,
doesn't relate directly to pine (the first couple of messages did),
and tends to fill the inbox rather quickly.

Just my $0.02 worth.

Mike:
	Some of use do not have access to a newsgroup.

This is a good idea, in my opinion.

1. It permits easy use of kill files to reduce noise.
2. Can be easily ignored when you're busy.
3. Will be readable with the PINE newsreaders of the future.
4. Will increase readership.

Yes, but the mailing list could still be administered for people with 
no News access.

The rest of us could use the newsgroup, and select which articles to read!
