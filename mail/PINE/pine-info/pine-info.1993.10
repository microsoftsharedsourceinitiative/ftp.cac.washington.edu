I agree totally with your sentiments but one thing must be made clear for
correctness.  VMS mail does have an undocumented feature to send base64
encoded files.  It works to a MIME mailer but unfortunately it doesn't
work the other way, i.e., VMS mail won't recognise a MIME attachment (only
from another VMS-mailed attachemnt).  For some strange reason DEC desided
to stall on the base64 feature about the time MIME started to become
known and popular.  As usual DEC does it first but no follow through.

A suggestion for the next maintenance release - could we make the 
location of rimapd configureable in the "build"

We like to keep locally installed stuff separate and hence install in 
/usr/local/sbin.

At present we edit the source, but a configuration option would be tidier.

Regards

Laurie Cuthbert

This morning (1st October) the usual "Delete old sent mail" question 
appeared to take a l-o-n-g time to do it's job, i.e. hang. To overcome 
the problem I used Pine 3.07 to satisfy Pine's requests for dealing with 
previous months' sent-mail files.

I know you're running PTX at Washington, but are you running PTX 2.0.4 and 
had the same problem?


Dave

PS Other than that, Pine is fine!

I had exactly the same problem today, running 3.85 on SunOS 4.1.3 machines.
Seemed to hang forever.

As an aside, I prefer to save old mail for a long time. It would be nice
if Pine did *not* ask if I wanted to delete the old mail folder for *each
and every* sent-mail-xxx-1993 folder I have! Is there any way to avoid these
questions?

NO (sorry, I cannot find any bigger letters on my keyboard)

Mail is available to all and fairly fast. News is available only to some 
and is variable but mostly slow.

Have you heard of a program called mailbase? Written at the University of 
Newcastle upon Tyne (just down the road from me), it was conceived as a 
LISTSERV program for unix but is now much more. It functions as a mailing 
list expander but you can also archive the messages and read them using 
gopher. [Type gopher mailbase.ac.uk to see examples.]

The program is free to UK eduactional establishment because of its 
funding. postmaster@mailbase.ac.uk could say what the position is for 
foreigners.

Can we gateway it to a newsgroup, so that people who want to read it via news
can, and the rest of us can stick with email?

It's the beginning of the month...  and I am being asked about deleting 
my old mail by pine.  With 3.85 this seems to take ages, moving the 
sent-mail to sent-mail-sep-1993 was OK, but it seems to take about 30+ 
seconds to digest my "n" answer to 'Remove sent-mail-???-1992', then even 
longer (maybe 90 sec) to *not* delete sent-mail-aug-1992, then another 
long period to deal with Sep 1992...  It even seems to take a long time 
(a minute or more) to put up the No when I type "n" at the propmt.  

This is an annoyance to me 'cos I keep a couple of years of mail lurking 
around by default.  For now I can kill pine, rename all the sent-mail-* 
folders to something else, re-start pine.  It fit *my* working pattern if 
all pine did was to move the sent-mail and then not ask about deleting 
mail (another addition to the feature list?).

I am running 3.85 (with both patches) under SunOS 4.1.3 on a Sun 4c.  The 
CPU meter on the local machine and the remote machine both seem to be at 
about 0.  Sorry if this is one of those problems that loads of people 
report as they get into work in the morning today :-)

Still, loads of features about 3.85 are really excellent (tab completion 
of folder names, folder collections, saved-name-rule, ...).  Thanks again.

Mike

Mailing lists and news are not mutually exclusive and news, for some,
has very rapid distribution.  Many lists are sent into and out of news.  
I'm not sure which way I would end up preferring, but I wouldn't mind
having the choice.

I haven't been following the discussion on PC-pine thoroughly enough to 
know if this has been suggested already, but after about 10 minutes of 
usage I already miss something badly. The ability for the ESC key to take 
me back, e.g. from the addrbook to the main menu. All I get know is an 
annoyin beep.

Thanks Ned, for that posting.  One thing I probably should add to what
I said yesterday.

The current theory about what to do about the proliferation of MIME-
defined character sets is to start issuing Applicability Statements at
some point that identify things as, e.g., "good", "not-so-good", and
"probably you shouldn't use this trash".  Now IETF has been a lot better
at talking about A/Ss than about doing them.  And the feeling has been
to let experience accumulate for some months before trying to get serious
about this one.

However, if someone has a theory on which such a document could be built,
I'd be happy to see a draft proposal.

In the meantime and thereafter, mail systems must be prepared to receive
character set specifications they haven't heard of before and to handle
them in a fairly graceful way.  And the meaning of "graceful" is very much
a matter of taste.

I have a couple of mailing lists that I have redirected to a file as
well as to my inbox.  Said file needs to be trimmed by hand, but not
very often if you have the disk space (I trim sometimes only at the
first of the year.)

I don't know if you can do this (depends on your system & your
privilege), but here is what I've done, e.g.  I've subscribed to the
firewalls mailing list as user "firewalls".  Then I put these aliases
into the aliases file on my mail gateway:

    firewalls: fwall_folks, fwall_file
    fwall_folks: ken,max
    fwall_file: /home/ken/security/firewall-list

The mail to "firewalls" gets split to "fwall_folks" and "fwall_file".
You can see that Ken & Max get the list in their inboxes, and the
traffic goes to a file under my home directory as well.  This file can
be read as a mail folder.

I encourage all users here to subscribe to lists in this way whether or
not the redirection to a file is used; local readers can be added to
and subtracted from the list without bothering the mailing list
maintainer, and only 1 copy of each article needs to be sent &
received.  This is how I subcribe to the Pine mailing list (it doesn't
go to a file.)

    Same problem but running on a RS6000 530H and AIX 3.2.4 with each 
question taking longer and longer...

Switched back to 3.07 and had no problems.

We have a Solaris machine and ~100 SunOS 4.1.n other machines.

For the moment we're happy to run Pine in binary-compatibility mode on 
Solaris, but the mail spool is in /var/mail and not /var/spool/mail.

The actual mailboxes (held on SunOS 4) are mounted by the Solaris machine
at /var/mail. Our problem is how to allow users (who move from one machine
to another) to see their mail. We don't really want to use IMAP; why make
them "login again"? If they edit "inbox-path" to /var/mail/_username_
they're Ok until they switch machines. If we setup inbox-path in
/usr/local/lib/pine-conf on the Solaris machine, we can't name each user's
- we need to be able to say /var/spool/$USER or somesuch). If we link
/var/spool/mail to /var/mail then Barry Cornelius reports locking
problems.(See below)  Advice please!

Subject: Re: Pine and Solaris

It is possible to run SunOS 4.1.x binaries with SunOS 5.1 (which is part
of Solaris 2.1) if you use the Binary Compatibility Package.  I have tried
this with a SunOS 4.1.x binary of pine.  Most aspects of pine will work.
For example, this message was sent from a 4.1.2 binary running on a
machine with SunOS 5.1.

However, I found a problem with file locking.  This problem occurs in two
places:
    (1) if you use NFS to mount /var/spool/mail rather than use
        IMAP, then pine hangs on starting it up. For example, you can't
        get the mail index, and there is a lock on your mailbox;
    (2) if you use the g command to goto a folder, then pine hangs:
        there is a lock on the file containing the folder.

^W is search, ^] is frequently a telnet escape.  One of the fundamental=20

I also had the problem early this morning with it taking *forever* to 
accept my "no" for removing the old sent-mail folders.  I think it 
literally took *minutes* to respond to each keypress.  I never had any 
problem like this under Pine 3.05 and 3.07, perfectly normal response 
time when this question appeared.  This is on a DEC RISC box running 
ULTRIX 4.2A.

Note that I was trapped at 1:00 am when dialing in from home, because at 
the "Delete sent-mail-xxx-1993?" prompt neither Ctrl-C nor Ctrl-Z had any 
effect, these keypresses were just ignored, so I couldn't easily break out 
of the Pine process and rename the folders.  Once I did rename the 
folders (to mail-xxx-1993) everything functioned normally.


I agree that it would be a nice configuration option to have it not ask 
you about removing old sent-mail folders.  I too keep my mail around for 
a long time, and it would be awfully nice to not have to hit Return 20 
times on the first of every month.

You have to change some other control-commands.  I ended up killing
spellcheck and using its letter for fill-para, since other "good"
control letters are used up.  I'm not happy with it but it makes Pine
usable and that's what I want.  It's a batch of changes since the
actual command, menu, and help all have to be fixed, and ^J has to be
made a synonym for ^M in several places.

It's a Pine bug as far as I'm concerned.  The rest of it is good enough
to make it worthwhile to fix.  We did skip 3.07 to avoid doing it
though.

Although I was certainly under the impression that there were file-locking
problems using a 4.1.x binary with SunOS 5.1 back in March, at a later
date (perhaps in May) I was unable to reproduce the problem.  

We have successfully used a 4.1.2 binary on a 5.2 system without any
problems.  I thought I had sent a message to the pine-info mailing list
retracting my words, but I can't find it in my back numbers of this list. 
I'm sorry if I have misled anyone.

We've recently switched to WINQVT/net version 3.6 here and printing is not
functioning well at all.  It's slow, keeps defaulting to a doublestike
font, and inserts a separator page between each message printed.  Perhaps
these problems have been corrected in later versions.  We've seen a version
3.93 on the net but haven't tried it yet.

We run PTX 2.0.3 on a fairly old S81...No such problem for us...

As many of you have discovered by now, there is a bug in pine 3.85 that
can cause inordinate delays in the monthly sent-mail pruning.  The bug has
to do with a sleep intended to introduce a *brief* delay before over
writing the message line with a new prompt.  The bug has nothing to do
with the actual pruning itself, and all folders are copied properly (if
you have the patience to wait long enough). 

There are a couple of ways to work around the problem.  As suggested here,
fooling pine into not prompting by editing the .pinerc is one option. 
Setting the "last-time-prune-questioned" variable to "93.10" or deleting
the date altogether should do it.  This is the best fix if the "sent-mail"
folder is part of a remote collection (i.e., the first folder-collection
listed is remote).  The other option, also suggested here, is to run an
older pine version to handle the pruning. 

Attached is the diff for the fix that will be in the pine 3.86 maintenance
release next week.  It takes a much less "sophisticated" approach to
figuring out any necessary delay.  We'll also take a look at options for
turning off the pruning in general. 

My sincerest apologies for any problems this has caused.

We disagree.  It seems clear that the bug is in the NextStep telnetd.

I would like to add a note of caution.  Granted, I'm ``Mr. IMAP'' so you
may need to take this with more than the usual grain of salt (a 20 ton
boulder of salt, some may say...).  But, I think that using NFS as a means
of remote access to mail is, in general, a horrible idea.  There is a
reason that I invented IMAP. 

The problems range from performance, to scaling, to being able to enforce 
locks across the network.

The extra password problem can be solved by use of the rimap mechanism, 
and we *will* be supporting Kerberos, perhaps sooner rather than later.

We've tried our best to make NFS access work, due to the demand for it, 
but there are known sharp edges that will get you if you aren't careful.

Not necessary if you use the pre-auth feature (rimapd).  It's described 
in the tech-notes.  Each user must have a .rhosts in their home directory 
with the appropriate entries...

Later...

I agree that IMAP is better in most cases but for tightly coupled systems
on a local LAN I still prefer NFS.  I don't know much about rimap but
sounds like it's the best of both worlds. I've been using the NFS approach
with the recommended tricks like: 

/usr/var/spool/mail@server:/usr/var/spool/mail:rw:0:0:nfs:bg,hard,intr:noac:

for many months now and haven't had any problems as long as we don't try
to access the inbox from more than one machine at the same time.

I apologize for mailing to the list.

Earlier this week someone posted the address of a site where you can 
email to news.  Could some kind soul drop me a message with that 
information again?  An itchy delete finger hosed it by accident.

I should know better than to disagree with Ned Freed and John Klensin
about this, but...

My reading of RFC-1340 (Assigned Numbers) does not support the view that
all the character sets from RFC-1345 are registered for use with MIME. 
Unfortunately, the sections in RFC-1340 are not numbered, but nevertheless
there appear to be clear boundaries between major and minor sections: The
major sections have headings in ALL CAPS, and are listed in the table of
contents, while the minor sections have headings in Mixed Case and are not
listed in the table of contents. 

One of the major sections is headed MIME TYPES, and begins on page 77. The
introduction to this section refers to the authority granted to IANA by
RFC-1341 (MIME).  One of the sub-sections lists the registered MIME
character sets, and there are only ten of them: US-ASCII and ISO-8859-x. 

An entirely separate major section is headed CHARACTER SETS, and begins on
page 79.  There is no comment about the status of these character sets,
nor the reason why they are listed in RFC-1340.

There are some cross-references from the "MIME TYPES"/"Character Sets"
subsection to the "CHARACTER SETS" section, but I interpret these as
beiong purely informational.  Perhaps a clarification should be sought
from the IANA regarding its intent.

And this is the problem. What's the purpose of listing character sets in the
assigned numbers RFC? There is only one such purpose -- registration for use
with MIME. In order to justify your position you have to explain what purpose
this list has if it isn't for MIME use. Thus far nobody has come up with an
acceptable explanation for this registry list if it isn't for MIME use.

And please don't try to argue that the character sets are not registered. The
entire purpose of this RFC is to register things.

I believe this has already been done, and the answer was that the character
sets have been registered for MIME use.

Much as I might like to believe in your interpretation (and Mark Crispin has
sent me comparable material in private mail), I just cannot buy it. I can only
reiterate the points John has already made. The IETF-822 Working Group set up a
registration process that is open to everyone. This is irrefutable -- see the
language in RFC1341 or RFC1521. Keld applied for registration of all the
character sets in RFC1345. This is also known to be true. Lacking any mandate
to perform any kind of checking or filterng and only requiring minimal
documentation as a prerequisite, IANA registered these character sets. And the
act of registering by definition carries with it the right to use them in MIME.

And even if I were to buy into your interpretation, you cannot possibly make a
case that proves my interpretation is invalid. This would be true even if
RFC1340 did not exist. Keld published his RFC and requested that these
character sets be registered for MIME use. I am aware of absolutely nothing
that would allow IANA to refuse such a request. As such, characterizing use of
RFC1345 character sets remains unacceptable.

This list is generating far too much traffic for me and would probably be

Jack, 
Could you elaborate on why you prefer NFS in the local cluster case?

We've had very good success with IMAP even in our NFS-linked clusters,
where the advantages Mark cited (performance, scaling, more robust
locking) seem equally useful.

When I first installed pine I didn't like the imap method since the users
had to type their passwords each time the wanted to use pine.  They might
as well telnet to the server.  Telnet's more secure too since there's no
.rhost file to worry about as is the case with rimap (I think). I didn't
realize there was the rimap method at the time but now I will try it when
I have time.  For now the NFS-served imbox and folders works well so I
and the users have no complaints.  Rimap will scale better but for now we
only have a few unix workstations to worry about.

I've been calling these things profiles. (A legacy of ANSI committee-speak? I
don't know where I came up with the term.) I stand corrected and will start
using the term "applicability statement" instead.

Hmm. Well, this would probably end up as a matter for ietf-charsets, and I'm
still smarting from my last scuffle in that venue. So I think I'll plead "too
busy for me to do all by myself" for the time being, and see if we cannot come
up with a design team to formulate at least the skeleton of such a document. 

Thanks for your note.

Tom,
 
 Address manipulation is the job of the MTA (e.g., sendmail), not of the 
MUA (pine).

It is, usually, a good idea to have fully qualified names.

I have heard many warnings that NFS is not the best way to read mail. 
However, we once had 100 Suns NFS mounting /var/spool/mail from various
places and I don't remember a single problem in 2 years.  I did experience an
"unexplained" catastrophe last year where I lost about 500 messages out of
the middle of my mail file.  (and no, it wasn't user error ;-) Of course, I
was not using pine at the time, but this shows you that it could happen. 
Your car can get broken into as well, but the chances of that happening
depend on where you park it, and nobody can say how much damage will occur.

We have just started seeing some problems with NFS /var/spool/mail
under AIX, there are times when the servers don't seem to be able 
to establish a proper lock and it just sits there.....waiting and
waiting...sometimes the cows come home before rpc.lockd stops
complaining..
I guess it's time to install imapd

Yes, rpc.lockd is famous for not working reliably.  I've heard of many sad
stories about people who trusted it, and now trust it no more.  Unfortunately,
it works most of the time, often enough that people are misled into trusting
it.

Good idea!  ;-)

Elmar -

     You are probably correct in your observation that you've used NFS for
mail reading for 2+ years without encountering many problems (you did lose
500+ messages once...).  Basically, it all hinges upon avoidance of certain
behaviors that would get you into trouble.  To a lesser extent, it also relies
upon certain mechanisms (.lock files, rpc.lockd) working properly and not
encountering one of their failure cases.

     If your user community is relatively sophisticated, and if the overall
size of the cluster is relatively small, and if the available bandwidth is
always guaranteed to be high, mail access via NFS should work out alright most
of the time.

     IMAP was designed to handle those cases where one or more of those
assumptions is not true.  At UW, none of those assumptions are true.

     I'm not going to tell you that you should switch from NFS to IMAP; I'm
just trying to keep people informed of the tradeoffs so they can make an
intelligent decision.  NFS does have the advantage of being able to leverage
off an existing infrastructure without having to build an IMAP infrastructure;
to my mind this is an unimportant advantage, but it is real nonetheless.

OK Mr. IMAP!  I've already switched!  I was supporting your opinion.

We have users who put 80 addresses in the To: field.  Two questions
related to this:

1.  One user complains of Pine dumping him back to the Unix prompt if
that user tries to edit the addressee list....  If he sends it, all is okay.
Any ideas???

2.  Another user at the end of a 1200 baud line in an overseas location is
the recipient of Email with 80 plus lines on the front of the message all
dedicated to the To: field. 
Is there any way to keep the addressees spread across the 70+ character line??
OR is there a way to set THAT user up so that the addressees
either do not show or they show at the end of the message??

Thanks,
John Daum

This is a bug that will be fixed in Pine 3.86 which will be out later 
this week.  It will be ftpable from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the /mail 
directory.

If you put the addresses in the Bcc: field rather than the To: field, 
they will not show up on the other end.  In Pine 3.07, set 
feature-level=old-growth in your .pinerc.  In Pine 3.85, set 
enable-full-headers in the feature-list.

Oops, disregard that last part.  Full-headers has to do with viewing 
messages rather than composing messages.  

When you are composing a message and the cursor is in the headers, the 
'^R' command will turn on Rich Headers.  Use the Bcc: field and none of 
the other recipients will recieve the full list of recipients.  

An even better way to send messages to alot of people is to use a mailing 
list manager...

Sorry about the mis-information.

Jon, 

The rule for all conventional Internet mailing lists (where "conventional"
means "not LISTSERV, Majordomo, or ListProc...") is to send a message to
an address formed by appending "-request" to the left-hand-part of the
list address.  Therefore, in this case, a message to
"pine-info-request@cac.washington.edu" would be the correct protocol. 

In the case of pine-info, which uses the Majordomo list manager, an even
better option --albeit one you wouldn't reasonably know about-- would be
to send a msg to "majordomo@cac.washington.edu" with one line in the body: 
"unsubscribe pine-info"

-teg

p.s. Apologies to everyone else on the list, but the number of
administrative requests sent to the whole list suggests that periodic
reposting of this info might be appropriate.

	Starting pine, ^Zing it to go do something else, and then 
forgetting about the ^Z'd process until you try to start up pine again, 
and then having to wait for it to try to talk to the other process only 
to find that it can't and that both are RO and having to kill both is 
rather annoying....  Could pine be fixed so that if it opens up and 
notices that another pine is running, it asks if it can make the other 
one RO?  This would save a lot of grief...

My views:

 -Both mailing lists and newsgroups have their places.
 -Having both, with bidirectional cross-posting seems desirable.
 -All of you will be happier if the UW team focuses on code-cutting
  rather than list management...

So this seems like a good direction to go, but someone else would need to 
volunteer to do it.

pine 3.85 will not compile for me under svr4...  It gets through

this:

then it doesn't spew out addrbook.o... what's going on?

We agree that this is annoying, but none of the various alternatives which we
have considered have been any better.  We'll look into this further, but for
the time being the best thing is to avoid suspending Pine and forgetting about
it!

The danger I see in all this back-and-forth posting is be that 
discussion would get even more desynchronised than it is now.

I still think you should take a look at mailbase.

As the manager of several lists and reader of several newsgroups, I agree.

> >  -Having both, with bidirectional cross-posting seems desirable.

Toolb-l (which manage) is posted also to a newsgroup (as a digest).  Cross
posting is not doable.  BEER-L is another list which is posted to a
newsgroup with no cross posting.  I don't know of any list/newsgroup that
has cross posting.  Let me know if you do.

I think they are doing a fine job of both :-)

I also wrote about this...I was wondering if it's possible to get the second
pine session to see if the first is sleeping.  If so, then make the second
pine session read only automatically and not try to grab the lock.

just wondering....

Subject:      PIne3.85 on RS/6000 AIX 3.2.3
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu

I built the Pine 3.85 on a RS/6K AIX 3.2.3 machine using 'build_a32' and
the thing built without complaint!  Congrats to all you a32 port-ers.

Now the bad news:
When I TelNet in (using FTP's TCP/IP Software on my PC) with vt220
emulation, Pine/Pico complains that "vt220 is not a known terminal"!
Other utilities, vi and less, have no problems recognizing the vt220 so
what's the problem here?

Many activities get me kicked out with a "signal abort" and a coredump.
Immediately reproducable is:
    pine
         'L' -- List folders
...death by signal abort.

Any clues?

I have been running only in 'test' mode -- from where I built Pine3.85
-- and have *not* moved the files to the appropriate /usr/local/...
areas.

John Benjamins at McMaster renamed pine to pine.exe and then wrote this
script which he called pine . This checks for an existing pine process and
if it finds one asks very nicely if it should be killed (mcmail is the
name of our mail machine.) This works on SGI - Irix 4.0.5 . I'm sure I have
one for sun 4.1.2 . I'll look and post later if anyone wants.

I *thought* that comp.mail.mime was cross-posted, but I could easily be 
mistaken on that.

We agree that this is annoying, but none of the various alternatives which we
have considered have been any better.  We'll look into this further, but for
the time being the best thing is to avoid suspending Pine and forgetting about
it!

what we do here is run a perl script called pine.  it checks for a
file like /tmp/.\usr\spool\mail\loginname.  if this exists it uses
fuser (system V only, sorry) to kill the process that has the file
open.  it then exec's the REAL pine binary called pine.x.  well
actually it has a couple of prompts in it, to make it more friendly.
if it finds the lock file, it says that you already have a pine
session running.  it then gives you the option of killing the original
session and starting a new one, or starting pine in read-only mode.
this has worked very well for us.  we had to do this because many
people here use a terminal emulator on their pc's to login to the
mailhost and read their mail with pine.  unfortunately sometimes the
pc's will hang, get rebooted, etc.  these leave pine sessions running
on the mailhost, so the next time they login they are in read-only
mode.  this script gets around having to explain how to run
ps/grep/kill to get around the problem.  sounds like it would help for
this case as well.

i'll include the script here (from an sgi, needs tweaking to work on
sunos, etc.).

hope this helps.

This is a wonderful, great script, there's only one slight problem... It

I have a couple of suggestions for the next release.

1) Can the "^R Rich Hdr" function in the composer be expanded to include 
"Acknowledgement-To:"?

2) Can we add "no-confirm" to the feature list? "no-confirm" would turn 
off all the confirmation [y/n] messages?

How about keeping the mailing list going, and archiving the mail on a gopher
server?  I think that gopher is accessible to more people than is news. 

Anyone that watches the sun-managers list will know that any message that has
the word "summary" in the subject header is automatically archived on a
gopher server, so that all the answer-less questions are not saved.  There is
usually much less traffic on pine-info, so I am not sure that we would need
to filter out any messages, or if we did how it would be determined. 

The next question is, "Who maintains the gopher server?" If I had more time
on my hands, I'd volunteer to do it myself because I've been offered free
access to a campus gopher server with reportedly "gobs of disk space".

Can the non implemented features be removed ?
How do I stop Pine from writing to sent-mail ?

There will be extensions to the headers available in future versions of 
Pine.  The "Acknowledgement-To:" header is not part of any standards I am 
aware of though...

There will be a couple more options in Pine 3.86 to reduce confirmations.

Well, we have thought about taking out the non-implemented features, but 
have not done it.

To stop writing sent-mail, set default-fcc="" in your .pinerc.

Yes, taking them out would be almost as much work as finishing them! :)

Note that most of them are individually enabled in the .pinerc, although 
included in the "old-growth" package.  So one could cause all of these:

# enable-unix-pipe-cmd          (included in old-growth set)
# enable-bounce-cmd             (included in old-growth set)
# enable-apply-cmd              (included in old-growth set)
# enable-flag-cmd               (included in old-growth set)
# enable-zoom-cmd               (included in old-growth set)

to disappear from the keymaps by not setting "feature-list=old-growth" and
explicitly listing just the things you want. 

Apply and Zoom will take awhile yet, but pipe, bounce, and flag should 
definitely make it into the next non-maintenance release...

Thanks for the info.

Well I got Pine3.85 to compile under Solaris2.2 using GCC2.4.5, the flags
in the makefile.sol should be set to :

-traditional (removing the -ansi and -DANSI)
I also user the os-sv4.h and .c files for the os dep.

I thought you might want to include a HOW-to compile under Sol2.2 with GCC
in there somewhere, I can be a contact if you like.

Did it, and it fixed that problem!  Thanks for the tip.
For other RS/6K AIX 3.2.3 users, the changes are to:
    pine/makefile.a32 and pico/makefile.a32
         change modules: tcap to tinfo (:%s/tcap/tinfo/g)
         change library: termcap to curses (:%s/termcap/curses/g)
and re-make for a32.

This is the way Pine was designed.  When you have a multipart message, 
there is really nothing in the format of a message to distinguish the 
body of a message from the attachments.  Pine happens to make the body of 
the message the first part, but there is nothing in the standards that 
say that has to be the case.

Thanks for the good words, I'm glad you are finding Pine useful.

We made a conscious decision to not give Pine a concept of where "back"
is.  One of the principles of Pine is that hitting a particular key will
do the same thing every time, regardless of the past sequence of commands. 
Using the ESC key is also a problem because of the need to distinguish the
ESC key from an escape sequence.  Programs like 'vi' try to get around
this by using a timer, but that is very unreliable over slow or heavily
used connections.  This leads to surprise, which violates another of our 
major principles.

Sounds like you've got profiling turned on.  That would usually get 
turned on by having something like -p or -p<something> in the CFLAGS when 
you compiled.

I agree 100% that gopher is accessible to more people than is news. [Of 
course, if you used the mailbase programs, you would have a gopher server 
there.] Now I will stop saying this because we seem to be spending more 
time on how to deliver the message than on discussing pine!

One of my users has just noticed that the way in which cut text is 
handled between 3.07 and 3.85 is different.

He used to be able to combine the contents of more than one message by, 
for example:

  starting to forward <message 1>, go into the body, cut the exciting 
  lines.

  cancel the forward of <message 1>

  reply to <message 2>, go into its body, uncut the lines which were 
  cut from <message 1>

This allowed him to quote from a number of messages even from a VT100 or 
similar terminal where the luxury of a window system provided cut & paste 
facility wasn't provided.

Is there any chance of the "old" behaviour slipping back into 3.86, or is
there some workaround that I have missed? 

Thanks,

Mike

Ok, so I have the code for pine 3.07 (I'd rather this then 3.85, just
BECAUSE it has less fetures-- les problems...) and I am trying to compile
it on a really low machine, A CTIX (Convergent Tech Unix) S/80 which is the
equivallent to Unisys's System/80. I can't seem to find a platform that
would be compatiable although I saw in pine-ports some that may be, but
could not find their makefile. Does anyone havve any experince with it?

We are trying to donate two of these machine to a small college to have them
starting with some email capabilites, to join the cyberspace world. 
So : any ideas? Suggestions? MATERIALS (I will ftp, if possible to get it!)

Thanks, Yigal.

I tried mailing to 2 addresses of the format:

 @vm.uni-c.dk:user@node

which is a fully legal way of mailing to EARN and BITNET users 
(vm.uni-c.dk being my local gateway).

However PINE wouldn't accept it, claiming there to be "Junk at end of 
address". In this case I'll claim the "junk" to be in pine instead.

My first suggestion would be to get Pine 3.85.  Even though it has more 
features, we have done _alot_ of work to make it easier to port to new 
platforms.  In 3.07 we barely had any SYSV support.  Now we have several 
SYSV variants running.  A CTIX port may still not be easy, but we are in 
a position to better help you with 3.85.

Alternatively, there is a person working on a port of Pine to the 
UnixPC (SVR2).  If you like, we can get you in contact with him.

Yigal,
We would *strongly* urge you to upgrade to Pine 3.86, which will be
released tonight or tomorrow...  3.86 has important bug fixes compared to
3.07, including improvements in MIME attachment typing that will affect
everyone who receives *your* messages with attachments, and will also
limit your ability to participate in the Internet remote printing (fax
gateway) experiment. 

Almost all of the new features in Pine 3.85/3.86 are optional and must be 
explicitly turned on.  (And some of them are even believed to be useful :)  
Finally, 3.85/3.86 is emminently more portable than 3.07, so it should
be much easier to get it running on CTIX.

Please reconsider your decision to promulgate 3.07.

-teg

We just got a report that Porting 3.86 to DG/UX was "hardly worth calling 
a port".  He was using our SVR4 port as a baseline.

I agree - pine should not force addresses to be in a certain format.

-Mike Corrigan

     I tried mailing to 2 addresses of the format:
     
      @vm.uni-c.dk:user@node
     
     which is a fully legal way of mailing to EARN and BITNET users 
     (vm.uni-c.dk being my local gateway).
     
     However PINE wouldn't accept it, claiming there to be "Junk at end of 
     address". In this case I'll claim the "junk" to be in pine instead.

When Pine 3.85 was first released, I posted a message stating that we
were consistently getting core dumps when replying to messages from certain 
sites.

We have since narrowed the problem down.  It appears that pine was having
trouble replying to messages that did not have a Message-Id header.
Message-Id header generation was (by default) turned off in our sendmail.cf. 
It appears that pine generates it's own Message-Id header so that if
a pine user received a message sent with pine the reply command worked fine.
However messages generated with any other mailer (mail, mailx, elm 
etc...) caused pine to dump core when the reply command was issued.

We have since cleared up this problem by uncommenting the line
"H?M?Message-Id: <$t.$i@$j>"  in our sendmail.cf file.  Now all messages
that pass through our system get a Message-Id, but I'm wondering if
this is a bug in the latest version of pine, or if our system was configured
incorrectly to begin with.  We have never had problems with any other mailers
or previous versions of pine.

Source routes are actually required to be in brackets.  I think if you 
use brackets it will work.

Please review RFC 822 and RFC 1123.  The correct syntax is
  <@vm.uni-c.dk:user@node>
and that works just fine.  If you investigate the other address formats that
Pine attempts to parse, including some very common bogons, you'll see why the
brokets are required; too many ambiguities otherwise.

However, I question why you are using RFC 822 source routing addresses at all.
These have been deprecated, because ``node'' is required to be a valid entity
in the Domain Name System.  So, you have to use something like the infamous %-
hack, e.g. user%node@vm.uni-c.dk, to get around this.

Sigh.  I was one of the individuals, 10+ years ago, who pressured (rather
LOUDLY) for source routing in RFC 822, after the Powers That Be of the time
banned the RFC 733 multiple-@ syntax (which looked like ``user at node at uni-
c-vm'').  When RFC 822 was issued, I went to implement source routes and
immediately ran up against the ``must be a valid name in the  host table
(later DNS)'' rule.  The %-hack was a 2AM fix for the problem.  [Not that the
%-hack was without problems; it was responsible for the entire OS development
group at a major computer vendor being unable to log in the next day...]  :-)

We are running Pine 3.07 on DECStations 5000s under Ultrix 4.3a.  We seem to
be having a problem with the "Reply TO All Recipients?" feature.

The "Reply To All Recipients? (y/n)" prompt always comes on even when the
original message was sent to only one recipient.  Can some one shed some
light on this?

Thanks in advance.

I have noticed this too.

If you reply to a message with no Message-ID line, with 3.85 compiled for 
HP-UX 8.07, Pine will generate the following line in the reply: 
   In-Reply-To: 
With SunOS 4.1.x, Pine 3.85 will generate the following line in the reply:
   In-Reply-To: (null)
However, with SunOS 5.2, Pine 3.85 will crash if an attempt is made to
reply to a message that has no Message-ID line. 

The problem lies in the function generate_reply_to in the file
pine/reply.c.  This function attempts to use sprintf on a pointer which I
believe is NULL when replying to a message with no Message-ID line.

The following patch solves the problem.  With this patch, the In-Reply-To
line is not generated (when replying to a message with no Message-ID
line).

I have reported this to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu, and Michael Seibel

in 3.86.

Pine 3.07 had some difficulties with the matching algorithm when 
comparing the recipients of the message with the sender of the reply.  If 
you reply to a message directed only to you and answer yes to "Reply To 
All Recipients? (y/n)", you should see your name in the cc: header.

This problem is fixed in Pine 3.85.  Unless something crops up in the 
next few minutes, we will start packaging Pine 3.86 this afternoon.

Your first problem is on the list for the future, but it will not make it 
into the Pine 3.86 maintenance release.  One way to look at it is that 
the message is new to this folder...

Your second problem is more difficult and has recieved some attention in 
other postings on pine-info in the last few days, so I won't go into it 
again.

Subject:    Pine 3.86 released
X-Owner:    pine-announce-request@cac.washington.edu
X-To:       Pine Announce Distribution <pine-announce@cac.washington.edu>

Version 3.86 of Pine and PC-Pine is now available.  The release also
includes new versions of Pico and IMAPd. 


STATUS...

This is primarily a maintenance release, although there are actually a
couple of new features (and therefore a chance of a few new bugs).  In a
few cases, we changed Pine's behavior back to the way it was before 3.85,
based on feedback from you. 

There are some important bug fixes, so we encourage everyone to upgrade to
3.86 as soon as possible.  You should update your IMAPd as well. Pine's
method of discovering remote folders has been changed (to avoid an
unfortunate conflict with other IMAP clients that make use of a hidden
.mailboxlist file) but will be somewhat slower *unless* using the new
IMAPd.  There are other IMAPd fixes as well. 

The list of changes/fixes is appended... and is quite long, considering 
that 3.85 is only two weeks old!


HOW TO GET IT...

--> Via anonymous FTP

  ftp pine.cac.washington.edu
  user: anonymous
  passwd: your email address
  binary
  cd mail
  get pine.tar.Z    <-- full distribution, including Pico and IMAPd
  get pcpine_f.zip  <-- version for FTP PC/TCP
  get pcpine_n.zip  <-- version for Novell LWP
  get pcpine_s.zip  <-- version for Sun PC/NFS
  get pcpine_p.zip  <-- version for Packet Driver
  quit

There will also be precompiled binaries available for certain
platforms.  These will have names like pine-bin.ultrix.

--> Via PC-Pine

PC-Pine users can also obtain new versions via the "Update" option under 
the Main Menu "Setup" command.  From the Folder Index of the Update 
Server, just select and View the msg containing the version you need, 
then View/Save the attached Zip file.

Note: it is still true that, because attachment encoding/decoding has not
*yet* been performance-tuned, using Update and Save will be slower than
FTP, but it may be more convenient. 


RELEASE NOTES (Changes since 3.85)...

 -Revert to having GOTO enabled by default.
 -Revert to allowing open folders to be deleted.
 -Revert to former meaning of -i command line flag.
 -Add command line flag -I for initial keystroke list (replaces -i overload).

 -Allow negation of previously-enabled features by prefixing "no-".
 -Add "by-from" name rule; change "by-sender" to use Sender: field

 -Change "save-by-X" rules to strip routing data from offered foldername.
 -Change Pine to use FIND ALL, to avoid conflict with .mailboxlist.
 -Change IMAPd's FIND ALL behavior to not check file type.

 -Change composer to only put one blank between .sig and included text.
 -Change pine to expand tabs on fixed, 8-char boundaries.
 -Change address book nickname display length to match input limit.
 -Change inline-text encoding rule to use quoted-printable more often.
 -Change NewVersion message to indicate it only shows once, etc.
 -Change wording of monthly pruning message.
 -Change Ctl-K message to appear less frequently.

 -Fix: Delete in/after spell-check may trash msg or crash Pine.
 -Fix: crash resulting from M->S->? key sequence. 
 -Fix: crash resulting from null To: field.

 -Fix: [Mark Set] message should vanish after ^K. 
 -Fix: "No attachments" msg in Postpone is too long to fit. 
 -Fix: Ext. help inclusion confusion (insert page breaks as file is read). 
 -Fix: Low-speed fixes that broke in Pico 2.0.
 -Fix: Select/Goto should return to previous folder when open fails.
 -Fix: Spaces at beginning of filenames are now ignored in Save/Export.
 -Fix: put domain literal brackets around X-Sender when necessary.
 -Fix: Can't save to INBOX if "inbox" is implicit in inbox-path.
 -Fix Pico so lines w/tabs display correctly when characters deleted. 
 -Fix negative network number in bracketed host numbers for DOS SMTP clients.
 -Fix Tenex driver to never cause a kiss-of-death to be sent or received.
 -Fix: Some global config options not transferred/displayed correctly?
 -Fix: Use "default state" when returning to INBOX, instead of wrong msg #.

 -Make PC-Pine more graceful when out of memory during a Send.
 -Suppress From: (Sender Unknown) in included headers for -nr mode
 -Improve performance of TAB and Del-skips-del on large folders.
 -Improve failure case when .addressbook or .pinerc can't be re-written.
 -IMAPd ignores kiss-of-death if current mailbox is not bezerk, mmdf, or mbox
 -Use XHDR in NNTP client drivers to work around a missing LISTGROUP command.
 -Internal FIND/FIND ALL redesign (no user or Pine-visible changes)
 -Create separate VAX ULtrix (VUL) port.
 -Rsh program name and pathname now set in c-client makefile for each port.
 -Modify some ports to be only makefiles (and perhaps os_???.h files).
 -Suppress Tenex driver new-mail snarf if it can't get RW access to spool.

As always, thanks for your interest in pine!

A bug capable of causing Unix Pine to crash has been found (already).
It will occur if your FCC is a path name, e.g. ~/sent-mail

The file /mail/patches-for-3.86.tar on ftp.cac.washington.edu contains 
the fix. 

Thanks to Leland Woodbury <leland@pipeline.com> for the quick bug report

Are you seriously suggesting that I should tell my users: "Oh yes, btw 
for some addresses you might need to put it in <>s" ?

I don't posses your intimate knowledge of RFC 822 nor 1123, which I 
assume is the host requiremtns rfc, but from a user's perspective I'd 
rather have PINE accepting the address. The UAs I've used previously 
generously did this, and to the best of my knowledge did not create any 
problems.

Looks like my weekend will be spent rereading 822 and reading 1123? ;-)

One additional feature available in elm would be very helpful.

In my elmrc file I had:

  # alternative addresses that I could receive mail from (usually a #
  forwarding mailbox) and don't want to have listed...  
  alternatives =erik.lawaetz@uni-c.dk uniel@danpost.uni-c.dk
          uniel@danpost2.uni-c.dk uniel@uts.uni-c.dk
          postmaster@danpost4.uni-c.dk

which helped persuade elm not to include these addresses in replies to all
recipients.

Unfortunately, yes.  There are ambiguities that occur otherwise.

How did the other UAs solve the parsing ambiguities?


To be more specific about the problem with source routes, the host
requirements RFC (RFC 1123) explicitly depreciates them (paragraphs 5.2.6,
5.2.19).  Technically, Pine is in violation of the Host Requirements by
permitting their use at all.  We would have no defense to the ``protocol
police'' if someone received a message with one that was generated by Pine
and complained. 

Host Requirements specifies that some means of mail relaying that does not
involve the use of RFC 822 source routing be used instead, e.g.
	user%node@uni-c.dk
(the so-called %-hack) instead of
	<@uni-c.dk:user@node>
This recommended way (RFC 1123 paragraph 5.2.16) is three characters
shorter and arguably easier to understand! 

So, we're between a rock and a hard place.  We're not supposed to permit
the user to use source routes, there's an officially blessed alternative,
and there's a possibility that it might break something else if source
routes were permitted outside of the angle brackets. 

Would it be possible to use the ``% hack'' instead?

 I have compiled pine 3.86 with the patch-for-3.86.tar fix but
get a segmentation core dump when I run it - No output comes out.
This is on a Sparc 2000 running Solaris 2.2.
 I found pine 3.85 compiled under Solaris 2.2 ok and ran ok.
I am compiling using Sun's c compiler with -Xs option in addition to your
 supplied options.

I have never sent the Pine people any wish list for Pine.  However, this
is one that I have been meaning to send them for the last 4 months: it is
the one that would top our wish list. 

Whenever you release a new version of Pine, I modify the code so that it
understands the mailnames that are used at the University of Durham.  For
example, although my username is dcl0bjc and this message is being sent
from vega.dur.ac.uk, my e-mail address is Barry.Cornelius@durham.ac.uk. 
So, I want to be able to include something in my .pinerc that will tell
Pine that messages addressed to the address Barry.Cornelius@durham.ac.uk
and Barry.Cornelius@dur.ac.uk are references to me. 

Is this the issue addressed by the "alternatives" variable of elm?  If so,
could we please, please, please have it in one of the next non-maintenance
releases of Pine.

The alternatives variable sounds like something we could do.  (We have to 
evaluate the idea and think about it and blah, blah, blah first, of 
course.)  To the best of my recollection, you are the first two people 
who've ever requested such a feature, but now that you mention it, it 
does seem like a feature that many mailers have.  Thanks for the suggestion.

Like you, I have compiled Pine 3.86 with the patches-for-3.86.tar fix on a
SunOS 5.2 (Solaris 2.2) machine.  I compiled it using: 
   
   /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -Xs ...

I run it on the same SunOS 5.2 machine using an IMAPd daemon running on a
SunOS 4.1.3 machine.  I have not seen the segmentation core dump problem
that you mention.

At our university, a person sees a full-screen menu after s/he logs in.  
Two of the items on the menu are worded M)ail and N)etwork News.  If the 
person presses M then pine is launched and if N is pressed then nn is 
launched.  If I substitute pine for nn, how can I keep pine from going 
into the INBOX.  I want pine when launched as a news reader to only look 
at USENET newsgroups.  I don't want the person to be able to switch into 
their personal mailboxes when they originally started pine as a news reader.

Second unrelated question, does anybody have a written document that they 
would be willing to share with me that explains why pine would be a 
better mail agent than elm for general users.  I need something that I 
can present that would make people see the light and switch to pine.

Check to make sure that you have something listed in the feature-list
variable in your .pinerc.  An empty feature-list triggers a bug on 
Solaris.  This will be fixed in Pine 3.87.

And a feature of no-something is allowed in 3.86 and would effectively be 
a no-op.

This is mostly a "me too" kind of reply in that we are also very interested in
other folk's experiences with using Pine as an interface to news.

Our interest is because we want to make it easier to electronically distribute
general announcements and information on campus. We don't want to distribute the
same email message to many hundreds of mail boxes (inefficient and, to some
folk, annoying). News groups are the ideal vehicle, but the learning curve for
most Unix mail interfaces would prevent most folks from reading news the
conventional way. Eventually, people can use Mac and PC based news readers (and
mail programs) with nicer interfaces. But for now most use some type of vt100
access to our central systems.

If most of our folk are already logging in and running Pine to read mail, they'd
have no problems using the same Pine interface to read announcements. We've
started playing around with 3.85 and have found that we can have .pinerc file
point to specific newsgroups and, using the initial keystroke options, start
Pine right into an index screen of that mail group.

What we'd like to know is what options/problems other folks have discovered for
similar types of services. Ideally, we'd like to present people with a front end
menu of commonly used Unix applications such as mail, announcements, scheduling,
and file management. Choosing mail gives you Pine, choosing announcements gives
you Pine pointed at a newsgroup (we assume we'd have to have this use a
different .pinerc for this). 

Anyone else trying similar things yet?

Are you sure you want to do this with the current version of Pine?  The 
current version of Pine can only read news.  It cannot subscribe, 
unsubscribe or post messages.  You still need another newsreader, like 
nn, to manage your subscriptions.

The status of Pine 3.86 is that 3.87 (a "maintenance release maintenance
release") will be coming very soon; hopefully within six hours. 

We still think we fixed more bugs in 3.86 than we introduced :), but 
there are several nasties that slipped by.  For sure the following
will be fixed:

 Leland Woodbury: crash caused by out-of-context FCC (Bezerk_open)
 Keith Christopher: Solaris crash when there is no feature-list
 Grant Weber: crash with [No Message Text Available] message
 Dan Larsen: crash on folder Rename

We are also trying to verify whether or not some of the other Solaris 
problems are manifestations of one of those bugs.

Apologies for the difficulties, and many thanks both to those who helped 
us find the bugs, and those who are being patient with them!

You could launch pine with the '-nr' option.  This puts it into a special
anonymous mode specifically for newsreading.  You could also use the '-p'
or '-P' option to use an alternative to .pinerc or
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf, respectively.

Hmmm...  About the best sales pitch we have found is a demo.  There is a 
special demo account, pinedemo@demo.cac.washington.edu, that anyone can 
use to get a feel for Pine.

Pine's news interface is at a very early stage of development right now.  
This is a very high priority topic for future releases though...

Calendar and scheduling functions are on the list of requested features

I've just made my subscribed newsgroups available via Pine. If I want to 
reply to a message I hit R for reply, delete the To:, and address it to:
"newsgroup"@cs.utexas.edu, which then forwards my reply to all sites 
getting Usenet. The only thing to remember is to add dashes instead of 
periods to a newsgroup's name:
i.e. alt-bbs-internet@cs.utexas.edu

Careful with this.  This is mostly intended as a UW flag and is in a

This version fixes several particularly unpleasant bugs found in Pine
versions 3.86 and earlier.  The bug fix list is fairly short, but should
make Pine quite a bit more stable and a little easier to use.  The list
includes the following reported bugs: 

 -crash in bezerk_open caused by out-of-context FCC (Leland Woodbury)
 -crash on Solaris with missing feature list (Keith Christopher)
 -crash with [No Message Text Available] message (Grant Weber)
 -crash on folder Rename (Dan Larsen)
 -crash with "Bad msgno in mail_fetchstructure" (Les Pennington)
 -need one more NL before included text if NO sig file (Jeannine Senechal)
 -makefile.sgi repairs (Mike Brudenell)

Thanks to all (including those not listed above!) who helped by reporting
and tracking down these bugs.  Apologies for any problems or inconvenience
they may have caused!

 Yes. It was indeed the lack of a feature list in .pinerc that caused the
problem.
After I set the right hand side to no- I was able to use pine 3.86
without a problem. Thank you

I would support this idea -

Internally to the dept my mail is generated as laurie@elec.qmw.ac.uk, but 
changed to L.G.Cuthbert@qmw.ac.uk at the site mailer. Replying to 
external mail therefore always includes my own name on the list when I 
choose the "all recipients" option with pine.

So would I! It's one of the few Elm features I miss in Pine.

I had gotten the following answer by David Miller then but I still beg

Hello,

	When pine went from 3.07 to 3.85 it was released as a compressed
tar file of over 2M bytes.  When 3.86 was released it also came out as
a compressed tar of about the same length.  I'm assuming that when 3.87
is released it will be much the same.

	Well, I'm not in the USA and my connection is an expensive
X.25 connection.  So, for incremental releases, I'm wondering if pine
updates can't be released as diffs that can be used as input to the
"patches" utility?  This would make the "free" software I obtain much
less expensive.  I can't believe I'm the only person in such a situation.

	How does one change the location of the system wide config file
from /usr/local/lib/pine.conf to something else?

There is a macro SYSTEM_PINERC in the pine/osdep/os-xxx.h file that is 
set to the name of the file (if you want to change it for everyone).  If 
you are talking about just changing it for a single user there is a -P 
<file> command line arg to do that.

Subject: Pine weirdness

Looking for help in (I hope) the right place...

I've got a bizarre problem with the new(er) versions of Pine.  It
cropped up with both post-3.07 versions I've tried (most recently with
3.87), so I've reverted to 3.07 (which works fine).

My system is a Sun IPC running SunOS 4.1.1.  I compiled using gcc 2.3.3
(by changing the CC=cc to CC=gcc in the build script).  It makes no
difference whether the DEBUG option is used or disabled.

I compile pine, install it, and change its permissions and ownership to:

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root     staff     2187264 Oct 10 17:18 /usr/local/bin/pine

When I run it, all is well.  Fine.  But if any other user tries it, it
fails.  For example, the user "server" tries it (in real life this is a
pseudo-user for a mailing list manager):

    [tbone]% pine


    Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
    Exiting pine.
    Arithmetic exception
    [tbone]% 

The debug file produced is appended at the end.  Any ideas on what's up?

Thanks!

-Dean

Anyone out there doing any work on Pine port for SCO?

The latest has makefiles etc to get through c-client, imapd and pico. But
nothing for pine.

I hacked up enough to get pine compiling and running. Would like to compare
notes.

I have no ported pine3.87 to run on DG/UX. If anyone else has done similar
work i would like to compare notes. Thanks David for the srv4 hint, you
were correct that the amount of work involved could hardly be called
a port. The 3.07 port i did was based on the ptx port.

After fixing the compilation error as in my previous mail, pine now

I am attempting to use ispell as an alternate speller.  Could someone 
provide me with the syntax to use.  Simply defining ispell as the speller 
in osdep.h is not working correctly.  Upon invoking the spell checker 
from within pico, the screen fills with the ispell help message.

Subject: Pine 3.85/3.87 problem with Solaris
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Message-Id: <Pine.3.87.9310121505.A24105-0100000@adam2.bnsc.rl.ac.uk>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII


I have built Pine 3.85, (3.86) and 3.87 for our multi-host-type
system,  and mostly it works quite well. We have the following setup:

3 x DECstation/Ultrix 4.2a
1 x DECstation/Ultrix 4.3
1 x Sun Sparc/SunOS 4.1.2
2 x Sun Sparc/Solaris 2.2
1 x DEC Alpha/OSF 1.2
2 x HP 9000/HPUX 8.07

Mail lives on the Sun running SunOS 4.1.2. It exports its
/var/spool/mail to the other machines in the group management domain.
The other machines  mount the directory over their own mail directory
usinh the NFS automounter. The sun has the following in its
/etc/exports:

	/var/spool/mail -rw=client1:client2:etc

(giving the names of our village of machines.)

All the user accounts reside mainly on disks NFS automounted around
the  system, chiefly on disks attached to the DECstations. 

The problem is this: 

For the Solaris machines, the user cannot access any of his mail
folders,  including INBOX. Pine locks up and refuses to do anything;
kill -9 being  the only way to dispatch pine AND its parent shell. The
lock occurs  immediately the access is tried: viewing folders or at
send time after  composing and mailing a message. The message itself
is mailed and arrive  ok at the other end (a VAX). Pine appears to
sleep and not wake up.

Only one user is able to use Pine on Solaris and his home directory is
on  a disk served by one of the Solaris machines. The rest of us are
stuck, resorting to the other machines for mail work.

Has anyone seen this sort of behaviour? I can supply debug logs and 
system call logs.

>From reading the pine-info list, I gather using imap may be the only
way out, but I'd rather not let Pine get too complicated and inflict
imap on our users when we have such a tightly coupled system. 

We have ~1600 users at ~25 sites around the UK waiting for Pine and 
most or the sites using similarly coupled systems, I'm hopefull that
this is a local system problem.

Cheers, Martin.

Yes, this is the correct behavior.  We base this on the requirement that 
an extracted attachment be identical to the original.  Only BASE64 
encoding guarantees this.  Some would argue that Quoted Printable would 
be better for text, but it does not *guarantee* complete preservation of 
an attachment.

Ralph,

Ever since the PINE mail agent was updated I've had problems with BASE64
coding.  Please see the attached reply from our Bangkok office.  The
problem is the same for Compuserve users and Internet users alike.  What
is BASE64 and how can I get PINE to work as it did before the upgrade?  

P.S. I've already reported this to the NOC with no reply.

Doug, 

Your last three messages have been unreadable.  I cannot decode them with any 
of my utilities.  I suspect that your MIME mailer is using an application 
specific encoding scheme.

Here are the first few lines of your last message.  Try using standard 
UUENCODE or ascii.

Although I wish there was a cleaner way to do this (feature suggestion?!
;-) I've found the defining ispell as the alternate editor in either
individual .pinercs or in the global pine.conf works quite nicely. 

It would be nice if an alternate speller could be defined, so one could 
have both it and an alternate editor, but the current system works fine 
for most people.

Because I didn't like the text in the printer setup screen (only
talking about "lpr" and "PRINTER", and not about "lp" and "LPDEST"),
I looked in the code.

There I saw the "redraw_printer_select()" function declared twice:
in pine/pine.c and pine/other.c.
The one in other.c contained the text I'ld like to have.

But .... is the function from other.c ever called?
I *always* get the text from pine.c.
And... I didn't get a link error....

I'm confused.

I believe when trn (Threaded Read News) invokes ispell, it uses:
ispell -x

But I'm not sure...Does this help?

Later...

I would also like to see an alternate speller added as a feature, as I 
quite often use an alternate editor which I do want to give up for a 
spell checker.

You can define an alternate spelling checker by setting the SPELL 
environment variable.  Note that whatever you define here must take the 
text input on stdin and write out a list of misspelled words on stdout.

I have notcied that, for some messages, with full headers switched on, the
BASE64 "gibberish" comes out, whereas with full headers off, "normal text"
comes out. 

To prove that I was able to read the BASE64 gibberish in your message, I
put the message with Subject field "Re; 8lb Baby Girl" into a folder,
switched full headers off, and found that the baby girl was born at 6.12am
on September 30th.  [Congratulations!]

I have also noticed that the presence of lines ending with carriage-return
following by line-feed instead of just line-feed causes the message to be
classified as BASE64 in the Unix version of Pine. 

I dunno if that helps.

Subject:      Pine 3.87 on AIX 3.2.3
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu, pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu

I had build pine3.85 on a RS/6000 AIX 3.2.3 with the following mods to
the makefile.a32:
    pine/makefile.a32 and pico/makefile.a32
         change modules: tcap to tinfo (:%s/tcap/tinfo/g)
         change library: termcap to curses (:%s/termcap/curses/g)
and it built just fine!  I just got 3.87, made the same changes and it
will *not* build -- can't find 'tigetstr()' anywhere.  This was a
problem I had when I tried to build 3.07 way back there and because of
it I abandoned pine because I did not have time to pursue the solution.
Obviously, somewhere in 3.85 it was solved but is now gone again!?  Any
clues?  Suggestions?

I could got the pine-bin.aix32, but it doesn't know vt220 or probably
any other vt above 100 on this system -- they go for the terminfo
approach and don't waste a lot of effort on termcap so those entries are
rather sparse compared to the terminfo database.  Also, I want to build
without the debug option -- I get a .pine-debug? created for each
invocation.

I would *really* like to get this sucker to build.

Bingo!  Thanks, Paul.

I have it built, but now I'm back to the problem I had with 3.85

I don't happen to have a 3.4.2 System -- any fixes or suggestions for my
nasty 3.2.3 System?

This sounds suspiciously like one of several bugs that were fixed in Pine 
3.87.  Could you try 3.87 and send me one of the core files if it still 
happens?

We had correspondence recently about the lack of Reply-To: in Pine. One 
of my users, missing the feature, has pointed us to the relevant text in 
RFC-822, which would seem to end the debate. If the RFC says it should be 
there, then the feature ought to be provided, and the only variable left 
is a decision about priorities.


     4.4.3.  REPLY-TO / RESENT-REPLY-TO                               
                                                                      
        This field provides a general  mechanism  for  indicating  any
        mailbox(es)  to which responses are to be sent.  Three typical
        uses for this feature can  be  distinguished.   In  the  first
        case,  the  author(s) may not have regular machine-based mail-
        boxes and therefore wish(es) to indicate an alternate  machine
        address.   In  the  second case, an author may wish additional
        persons to be made aware of, or responsible for,  replies.   A
        somewhat  different  use  may be of some help to "text message
        teleconferencing" groups equipped with automatic  distribution
        services:   include the address of that service in the "Reply-
        To" field of all messages  submitted  to  the  teleconference;
        then  participants  can  "reply"  to conference submissions to
        guarantee the correct distribution of any submission of  their
        own.                                                          
                                                                      
        Note:  The "Return-Path" field is added by the mail  transport
               service,  at the time of final deliver.  It is intended
               to identify a path back to the orginator  of  the  mes-
               sage.   The  "Reply-To"  field  is added by the message
               originator and is intended to direct replies.

1. I like to filter my mail into multiple incoming folders.
   Contrary to elm, pine keeps the empty folders, and consequently
   one cannot tell by the mere existance of a folder if new mail has 
   arrived, and one has to enter the folders.
   EAN for instance has the ability to show how many messages a folder 
   contains, and how many are unread/new.
   I know this requires checking out the folders, and maybe it will slow 
   down things too much?

2. When I do cut and paste in "brokenwindows" (OW 2.0) from one shelltool 
   window to the one running pine I'd like keep the structure of the data 
   I cut from the other window. pico however insists on making it a 
   pretty text. Any way out? Should I just RTFM?

The biggest problem with keeping track of all the incoming folders is 
that you have to keep them open, and with the default berkeley format 
folders, that means keeping them in memory.  In addition there is the 
extra overhead of checking each one for new mail.  We would like to 
display a count, or at least an indication of new mail, but have not yet 
figured out a good way to do so.

Pico has no way to tell that a "paste" operation is anything other than a 
sequence of characters.  Consequentially, word wrap occurs just as if you 
were typing.

Barry,
In general I tend to think of RFC822 descriptions as "if you are going to 
have field xyz, this is how it should be done."  Example: there is no
requirement that every message have a CC: field; 822 specifies what they 
should look like if they do exist.

However, this debate is academic: as we've said before, "Reply-To:" is 
definitely coming.  I can't say exactly when yet, but "pretty soon"...

While some people are asking for "Reply-To:" and other headers, a question
comes to mind: since RFC-822 essentially allows you any darn header you
please in an email message, why not have a facility that allows the user
to do just that, put in any header they want? 

While I'm here, I would also really like the ability to move to the bottom
of a long message I am reading and to do a search inside a message I am
reading. Things for the wish list.

Although I maintain Pine for those users who need/prefer it, I use
Sun's mailtool myself, and it has just such a facility -- I used it to
add the "Reply-To" header on this message so that any responses should
go to the list automagically.

Do the authors of Pine use only Pine?  It's a great application, but
they're wearing blinders if they don't survey what's being done by
other applications in the same field.  (They're probably well informed,
and it's just a matter of reaching a consensus of what's worth doing
and what's not.)

Letting the user add any header desired keeps the Rich Headers option
from getting too big and avoids the shortcomings of petrifying a list
what headers can be added.  Some applications (like the anon.penet.fi
anonymous mail server) use "X-*" headers of their own design.  I think
it's worth serious consideration.

I personally lean toward a laissez faire approach to headers, but be
advised that not everyone agrees that this would be desirable.  In the
past, some mail agent authors have been flamed for permitting arbitrary
headers because of their potential for perceived "abuse".  Alas, we have
at least our share of mischief makers.

Yes, but this is a good example of what I would consider *mis*use of the
Reply-To: field.  LISTSERV's are often configured this way, and it has 
caused enormous embarrassment to individuals who thought they were 
replying to an author, only to find their msg in thousands of mailboxes.
Fortunately, Pine gives you the option of ignoring the reply-to field, so 
that you get to *choose* where your response goes.

The pine team *tries* to keep up on current events, but we always
appreciate efforts to educate us... 

There is a consensus issue, but there is even more a *time* issue.  This is
only one of *many* enhancement requests.

Rest assured that it is getting serious consideration.  But also keep in 
mind who is funding this project.  In the 3+ years that Pine has been 
around, I believe that virtually all the requests for additional header
support have come from other sites.  With possibly very few exceptions, 
their absence has not been noticed by our constituency.

Having said that, I will state one more time, just to be really clear:
we will be providing additional header support in a future release.
Whether to permit arbitrary user-defined headers is not yet decided,
for the reason mentioned above, but Reply-To will certainly be there one 
way or another.

	I don't think it is so much a "preceived abuse" but a risk to
interoperability.

	As an example...  It doesn't matter whether or not you compile
MIME support into elm, elm will always generate a "Content" header.
A certain application at our site was checking for "Content" header to
determine if the message was MIME so it could further process the message.
The application failed since the message was not really MIME compliant.
Granted, the application should have been checking for the "Mime-Version"
header instead of the "Content" header.....maybe....since without the
"Mime-Version" header the "Content" is not defined and therefore should
not appear in a message.

	I believe that RFC-822 is quite clear in its intentions and
definitions.  If you are going to implement the headers defined in 822
(and its extensions) you must do so as defined.  If you wish to use 
headers not defined in the RFCs then you need to preceed it with an
X.  The reasoning is clear, in that later RFCs may define a header
that you have chosen to use and you may end up "breaking" compliant UAs.

	Remember too that RFC-822 and its extentions only tell you how
you must implement the defined headers.  It doesn't say you have to
implement them all.

	I like the fact that pine gives you the choice...but I can do without
it since I'm a more experienced email user.  For the less educated email 
user it presents a dilema.  "When do I say yes?  When do I say no?  If I
say no can I be sure my reply will get there?"  I would say leave the
decision of adding the "Reply-To:" field with the sender.  If it causes
"enormous embarrassment" it will not be the end of the world and the
user will learn a few things from it.  Not the least of which would be
to be more careful of what is said in email.

	I'm very sure the Pine authors are up-to-date on what is happening
in the world of email.  As far as I know, there is no UA in existence that
implements all of the possible features in all of the possible combinations
in all of the possible ways that everyone will like.  (Just be happy they
don't have to decide on what features of X.400 they should implement.)

	I for one am thankful that there isn't enough time to implement
all of the "*many* enhancement requests".  To do so would drive Pine to
the level of complexity it seeks to avoid.

	"X-*" headers of their own design" only make sense if they
convey information that the receiving UA understands and can make use of.
While I see some justification for them I also see the potention for
misue much like the *huge* .sigs I've had to endure.  Should the
authors of Pine decide to allow them I hope they also make it optional
to display them.

	That said, I'd vote for minimum additions to the "Rich Headers"
field and the ability to include a file of user defined headers on
which Pine would enforce the "X-*" convention.

	Thank you for considering it.  If I wore one, I'd take my hat off
to the Pine Team for being as sensitive as they are to indivduals outside
of their community.  And even if they decide against adding this feature
there are at least 2 alternatives...move to another UA or start hacking.
I, for one, would rather hack than switch.  :-) :-)

Maria,
My apologies for our not responding sooner... as you can imagine, things
have been fairly hectic lately.

Attached is a message that Steve Hubert sent to you and Markus on 21 Jul 
indicating that we probably wouldn't include the contributed changes for 
locking in home directories, and inviting further discussion --which was 
not forthcoming.

You mentioned in your original msg that "this feature of allowing locking
in the user's home directory (if defined) is harmless and very useful."

We discussed the locking situation further at our weekly development
meeting yesterday, and concluded that while locking in /tmp *is* a problem
in your environment (where a single /tmp is not globally available on all
machines), the proposed solution is not completely harmless, which is why
we are still a bit reluctant to encourage lockfiles in home directories. 

The problem is with the shared mailbox case.  Pine and imapd locks mediate
access not only between a single MUA and the delivery agent (which agent
presumably *can* be taught to find the lock file in the user's home dir),
but they *also* mediate access among concurrent sessions, of possibly
different users.  In the multiple user case, a process running on behalf
of one user has no knowledge of who else might be accessing the mailbox,
so would be unable to know where to look for the lock file.  If you are
using tenex or mbox drivers, it's even worse, since access to both the
inbox and the spool file has to be mediated.

If you don't allow (or at least don't advertise the possibility of) shared
mailboxes, this shared case may be of small consequence to you, but we 
are finding it increasingly useful and popular, so you can understand 
why we are concerned about giving the home directory lock approach a 
stamp of approval, even if only via an IFDEF.

We believe that the ideal model is to organize things so that *all* the
processes that directly manipulate a particular mailbox are actually
running on the same machine.  That doesn't mean running Pine on a file
server, of course, but it does mean running IMAPd on whichever machine the
mail is actually delivered to.  I realize this suggestion is not 100%
helpful if the delivery agent has been modified to accommodate non-IMAP
clients by looking for lockfiles in home directories. 

So the choices seem to be:

1. Use /tmp for lockfiles, with all processes directly manipulating a 
   mailbox running on the same machine.
   Pro: solves all locking problems even for multiuser shared mailboxes.
   Con: implies using only IMAP clients, or having a shared /tmp

2. Use NFS or AFS -mounted mailboxes with lockfiles in $HOME
   Pro: allows for concurrent non-IMAP and IMAP access to mailbox
   Con: precludes multiuser shared mailbox access, even in pure IMAP case
        (and in the NFS case, there are other problems.)

3. Postulate a "global" /tmp alternative, e.g. /gtmp
   Pro: allows for imap and non-imap access, and shared multi-user access.
   Con: highly non-standard; requires changes to all mail programs used.

4. See if it is feasible for the delivery agent to look in both places for
   lockfiles... on the assumption that users will not be trying to run elm
   and pine *simultaneously*.  (This also assumes using Pine in IMAP mode,
   but I can't think of any reason *not* to do that...)

5. Try to think of a clever solution using links... 

Comments?  Other suggestions?

Markus,

   Pine has changed quite a bit between our last release and the current 
development source, so it is a little tough to integrate ports.  We do 
have an AIX 3.2 system to work on and have a version that compiles and 
runs there.  Perhaps when we are just a little bit more stable (couple 
weeks maybe?) you would be interested in testing on your AIX system.  If 
so, we could send you an alpha-version to try to compile and run there.

   I don't believe we will include your LOCK_IN_HOME change in the 
source, however.  If you wish to try to convince us of that write back 
and we'll discuss it!  Thanks.

Subject: pine.conf

Hi,

I just compiled pine and I need to install pine.info and pine.conf
files in the /usr/local/lib directory, but I can't find sample
pine.conf or pine.info anywhere in the 3.87 distribution hierarchy.
Could someone please point me in the right direction? Otherwise,
the pine.debugX files keep getting bigger and bigger in each user's
directory....

Thank you.

You can get a default pine.conf by running "pine -conf".  The pine.info 
file is simply a text file with whatever local information you want in 
it.  I will attach a sample from one of our systems.

To my knowledge, you create pine.info yourself...

As for pine.conf, there is an option for pine to generate a fresh 
.pinerc...It's in the man pages...Then copy this to pine.conf and edit it 
to your liking...

Later...

Subject: Problem with .lock mailbox locking
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 93 16:09:16 MET
From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

I noticed the following behaviour:

When I make my pine (on System V.3) setgid mail, it creates a lockfile
for the INBOX (/usr/spool/mail/jos.lock on our system).

In a non-setgid (non-setuid) mode, pine seems not to create a .lock
file (it can't, because it doesn't have the right to write in
/usr/spool/mail), but it doesn't complain!

Any explanation for this behaviour?

Yes, there is an explanation.  Pine is not designed to run privileged, and
some sites (as a matter of policy) protect their /usr/spool/mail directories
so unprivileged processes can't create .lock files.

Pine uses two forms of locking: .lock files and the flock() call.  Both of
these are used by various versions of /bin/mail (which is what sendmail uses
for mail delivery).  Since Pine has no way of knowing which form of locking
mail delivery uses, it tries both.  Both forms have problems.

Because there are sites which deliberately, prevent the creation of .lock
files, Pine can only hope that /bin/mail uses flock() locking.  Otherwise, the
site's policy really is ``you can't have unprivileged programs accessing mail
files.''  On such a site, either you make Pine run privileged (and run the
risk with doing that), or take the risk of not having effective locking, or
you run Pine on another system.  :-(

Unfortunately, flock() (or lockf() on SysV) isn't a panacea either.

It's terribly annoying for Pine to issue zillions of error messages (we know;
our local computer center has the above policy) when there is nothing wrong
and flock() is covering Pine's rear.  Hence Pine's silence on this condition.

To summarize: Pine *tries* to do .lock file locking, and always does flock()
(or the SysV equivalent) locking.

The only other thing to do is to have some build configuration parameter in
the c-client library set what kind of locking to use.  There is a problem with
this.  In my experience, 98% of all the people who build Pine haven't a clue
of how to answer such a question, and the consequences of answering it wrong
are even worse than the current status quo.

We would appreciate suggestions of how to handle this any better.  We don't
think it is safe to make locking configurable; Pine should try all forms.  We
can hope that .lock file creation failure means ``don't use .lock files on
this system'', based on the assumption that the only other interpretation is
``only sysadmins can write/install mail programs on this system.''  We'd lock
to hear of any ``magic bullets'' that'll solve these problems!

Hmmm, so what is the risk of setting pine setgid to mail then?

That's understandable, but at least put a note in the docs that say if
you want .lock locking, pine must be installed setgid to mail. Then those
of us that do know can make an intelligent decision.

Pine does nothing to prevent abuse of being setgid to mail.  A setuid/setgid
program is supposed to check itself to make sure that system integrity is not
being compromised.  Pine was not designed to run with privileges.

Some note should go into the documentation about what's going on, but I don't
think that *recommending* that Pine be setgid is doing anyone any favors.

Personally, I feel that protecting /usr/spool/mail is needless, not to mention
obnoxious; why should a system manager take it upon himself to forbid J.
Random User from writing (or using) his own mail program?

But thanks for the suggestion, there *should* be some documentation.

OK, I am curious now, (honest!)

Are you saying that the mail spool should be 777 (or at least with the
sticky bit set on)?   Then if so, what is to prevent users from copying
whatever files they want up to the mail spool, or someone creating
a mailbox of a user that hasn't had mail delivered to them yet,
chmod'ing it to 664 and then chown'ing it to that user? (Sys V allows
chown by users)

This is my personal opinion ONLY!!!

Here's an alternative strategy:
 1) Create mail files for all users, and fix any system programs which presume
    to delete empty mail files.  [Pine does not delete empty mail files.]
 2) Consider disabling chown() for users.  Unprivileged chown() has several
    other security/denial-of-service implications, which is why BSD disabled
    it.  If necessary, have a setuid ``safe-chown'' program that makes extra
    checks before doing the operation (but note that BSD users have rarely
    complained about its absence).
 3) Make sure that your mail delivery program does not permit links to mail
    files, improper ownership, improper protection (600 only), etc.  Have a
    periodic task ensure that mail files are ``proper'' and that all users
    have mail files (creating if necessary).  Possibly also flag mail files
    which are caught in ``bad'' state and drop an alert to the user.
 4) Put in traps to catch people who try this stunt, and bop them on the head
    when you catch 'em.  A few well-publicized examples do wonders...
 5) Educate your users about the possibilities of forged mail, and that they
    should cast a skeptical eye at any mail that looks ``wrong''.  Maybe also
    educate them about not deleting their mail files.
 6) Create a non-adversarial relationship with your users.  It seems to me
    that sites that are the most concerned with preventing users from doing
    something that *may* be bad are the ones which end up with users who are
    always trying to ``beat the system''.

These 6 measures will do more towards achieving a reliable mail infrastructure
whose integrity is high than so-called ``magic bullets'' such as directory
protections.  It does require more work, which is why many sites seek out the
magic bullets.  But, in my opinion, the time invested in doing this is more
than paid back in the long run.

In our system all the INBOX folders are rw for owner and mail-group
(660). Also the /usr/spool/mail is writeble only for mail-group.
If we set sgid for pine, then anyone can read any INBOX-file. :(
ie. you can read other users mail...

Elm works fine and it is sgid mail. Could it be possible to change
pine to work correctly with sgid set?

Yes, and: I don't want my mailbox being deleted by other users!

Unfortunately, *trying* to lock means existing .lock files are
not honoured, isn't it?
So, when mail is just delivered to your INBOX, Pine doesn't matter :-(

I assume that making Pine setgid mail does not solve the problem.
When a lock exists, it'll just ignore it anyway.  Or am I wrong
(I didn't dig into the coding details yet)?

No.

The decision to give up on .lock file locking happens at a very specific
point; that is, when an attempt is make to create a .lock file and the
operating system returns a ``protection violation'' (EACCES) error.

In ALL other cases, .lock file locking is enforced.  This includes the case
when there is an existing .lock file.

In other words, Pine will not tromp upon some other program which has the file
locked.  But, if Pine is unable to make the .lock file, some othe program may
tromp upon Pine.

Does pine check periodically for new news like it does for new mail?  Can 
it be set to?  Could it be set to check the currently active newsgroup 
for new news?

Subject: Pine being setgid mail (was: .lock mailbox locking)
Date: Wed, 20 Oct 93 10:46:06 MET
From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

Some good and some bad news.

The good news is that making "pine" setgid mail (on System V systems)
makes .lock mailbox locking work fine.
Although it ignores failing .lock mailbox locking when the access is
prohibited (i.e., when pine is not setgid mail and the mail directory
is 775, is it should be), it honours existing .lock files and it creates
its own .lock file if necessary.

Now the bad news.

When pine is setgid mail, I can read evertbody's mailbox.
I did this by creating a symlink in my $HOME/mail directory
to another user's mailbox.

This is a *serious* security problem: System V mail locking is based on
.lock files, basically, and this *should* work properly.

Some problems with 3.87 and NNTP news-reading.

The command 'mode reader' should be issued after connecting to NNTP port
in case the host running the remote news reader also happens to feed the
local host.  This is peculiar to INN sites, and it is not a common
occurance even at INN sites. (If another site is feeding your local site,
you would normally read from your normal site, not the remote site.)
However, I am in the process of migating from one system to another and
attempting to move users slowly, so this situation currently exists.  It
shouldn't be hard to add, and just ignore any error message from a non INN
site.  What I get now is 'Group not implemented error'

Another issue.  I defined in the global pine-info file...

news-collections=Local-News *[dtcc.*]

When I expand the folder, it does list the local groups, but when I select
a group, all of the messages in the index say [No Message Text Available].
However, if I change it to be

news-collections=Local-News *[]

It works fine or

news-collections=Local-News *{news.dtcc.edu/nntp}[dtcc.*]

it also works fine.

NOTE: I want to break up the news stuff into the top level groups because 
if they are all in one, then it takes forever to expand the folder.

Unfortunately, I personally wish the login password was still used for
keyboard locking instead of asking the user to type the password in. I
have already had someone forget the password they used.  I guess this is
to eventually make it compatible with DOS platform, but I hate bringing
this to the lowest common denominator.

At least, if you have to have users enter the password, have them do it
twice to check for typos.  (Of course, maybe they will just enter it once
and leave, which will basically make the computer not secure if it is left
prompting for confirmation of password.)

I also miss the screen showing disk space used, mail space used, and quota
information.  I did modify the sources to show percentage of quota used
when they start up pine, instead of just displaying when they go above the
soft limit.

(This is all on DG/UX, which can have a hard quota (cpd) but no idea of a
soft quota anyway).

I have to agree with this.  What I have been doing when a user forgets
her or his temporary password is killing their pine process so they can
start another one.  It seems to be the safest thing to do in our
situation, but our sysadmins aren't on call after hours.

If you don't use the login password, typing the password twice is the de
facto standard, no matter how annoying it might be.

Thank you for making us aware of the problem with body parts of type
MESSAGE/SAMPLE (and its official successor, MESSAGE/RFC822-FRAGMENT) not
displaying in Pine.

This problem will be fixed in a future release of Pine.

     Pine is not intended to run with any setuid and setgid privileges.  Nor
is imapd.

     It is questionable that an improvment to system security is made by
creating a requirement that all mail-reading programs run with privileges.  It
is even more questionable that security is enhanced by granting privileges to
software other than that provided by your vendor.

     The infamous bug with the ``move-mail'' program, used by the cracker in
``The Cuukoo's Egg'', suggests the great danger of requiring privileges in
order to enable fundamental user tasks such as mail reading.  It should be
noted that move-mail itself was designed to be a ``safe'' privileged program
to do a particular task that required privileges so the main program did not
need any privileges.

     Pine has always supported .lock files.  This are one of the fundamental
aspects of locking in the mbox format.  The problem is that an unprivileged
program is not allowed to create .lock files on your system, because of the
bad protection you have placed on the /usr/spool/mail directory.

     A separate message outlined an alternative strategy for dealing with the
problem of a mischeivous user being able to create a mail file for someone
else.  Although this strategy is more complex, I urge you to give it serious
consideration.  Please also consider the great danger of having to give many
mail programs privileged access.

     I will suggest to my co-workers about the possibility of making Pine and
imapd safe to run with setgid privileges.  It would be a great deal of work to
make these programs privilege-safe, and the problem can be solved by an
alternative configuration on your system.  So I can't make any promises.

     If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Hi.

At the present time, Pine does not check for new news.  It can be done,
although there are certain technical difficulties, in the IMAP and local news
case.  I don't think it can be done in the NNTP case without re-selecting the
newsgroup (this is why the NNTP version of rn doesn't offer this).

We will consider this as a new feature to implement in a future version of
Pine.

We are still investigating this problem.  Am I correct in believing that on
the local machine, you have a /usr/spool/news directory tree and a
/usr/lib/news/active file?  Is the local machine also the NNTP server?

No, it wasn't, but I symlinked it and no difference. Besids, I can almost 
guarantee that I altered defines in the code to point to the right place.

More weirdness, With just...

news-collections=Local-News *[]

some groups with small number of articles has the empty text message, and 
then those with more articles could have the same article duplicated for 
~40 messages, then another set of ~40 duplicates.

And yes, the local machine is also the NNTP server. If I set it up
for nntp access, it works fine.

This is *seriously* wierd.  Can you give me access to your machine and
definite instructions on how to reproduce it?

Is there any possibility that you might have made a mistake in your alteration
of the defines in the code?  This looks very much to me as being symptomatic
of it not accessing the news spool files properly.

I have read your three messages on this subject.  I must say I was initially
surprised that pine doesn't run setgid.

I must be one among many who can't really contemplate using your "alternative
strategy."   Mail is only one of many services here and we can't put that much
effort into something which only improves, rather than fixes matters.  Nor do we
want a situation in which we have to continually create ~ 5,000 (mainly empty)
mailboxes in our spool area! 

You suggest disabling chown.  To do this effectively would mean a kernel
change.

You suggest we should endeavour to create a non-adversarial relationship with
our users:  I wholeheartedly agree here, but university students _will_
sometimes try to break security, whatever we do.

We are fortunate:  both our main system types (HP-UX and SunOS) support the
alternative meaning of the sticky bit on directories, so we are partially
protected from abuses of a rwxrwxrwx mail spool.  We still aren't fully
protected against users who create "false" mailboxes on behalf of others.

What to do?  Given an adequate modern Unix which will allow a setuid-program to
switch back and forth between identities there is no need for such a program to
"check itself to make sure that system integrity is not being compromised,"
except inside the "security box" in the program.  Everywhere else the program
runs with normal user privileges.  Some additional care also needs to be taken
with system resources (such as file descriptors) which are acquired inside the
security box but used outside of it.

Clearly such a restructuring of Pine would be a lot of work, but the result
needn't be much more dangerous running setgid than Pine is now.

The fact is, making your /usr/spool/mail directory protected 775 does *not*
``fix matters''.  It breaks matters in two related ways:
 1) Unprivileged programs can not be mail readers.  So, if someone has a neat
    idea for the Ultimate Mail Reader, he cannot write it on your system,
    because your system's policy prevents it.  If he sees a new nifty mail
    program on the net, he can't just FTP it to his directory and run it,
    because only programs that the system manager approves can be mailers.
 2) All mail readers must be privileged, and the slightest oversight in ANY
    single mail reader compromises your entire system.  How many more horror
    stories do there have to be about the setuid program that allowed you to
    spawn a root shell with !, before people realize how serious a problem
    this is?

I hardly call this an ``improvement'', much less a ``fix''.  It creates
adversarial relationships and provides multiple stress points that can be
tested for weaknesses.

I have discussed the question of making Pine be set[gu]id safe with my co-
workers, and I'll bring it up with our boss.  No decision has been made.  If
done, it is going to be a tremendous amount of work, now and in the future.

We have a very long ``to-do'' list of feature enhancements and bugs to be
fixed.  Should we divert our limited resources for several months (or longer)
towards an effort that adds no user function and is unnecessary with better
site management?

Would offering a /bin/mail substitute (you would edit your sendmail.cf to run
it instead of /bin/mail) that protects against mail being delivered to false
mailboxes be a satisfactory alternate?  We can offer this in a finite amount
of time.  This would fix the problem without requiring that mail readers run
with privileges.

Subject: (fwd) Problems with 3.87 on a Sun
Newsgroups: ornl.mail.pine-info

I've seen a couple of problems with pine 3.87 on a Sun Sparc 10 (running 
SunOS 4.1.3).

First, it appears that when you save a message to another folder, the
saved message gets marked as New, even though you've already read it.  This
is not the way it worked in 3.07.  Is this normal?

Also, we've been having trouble with users who apparently loose their
connection (they're calling in through modems) and their pine process doesn't
disappear.  Sometimes it not only doesn't disappear, but apparently goes into
a loop using up as much CPU time as it can get.  Any ideas what may be
happening?

Thanks,

Jim (s4i@ornl.gov)

specifically, pine processes started up over dialup don't always exit cleanly.
This was true of 3.85 as well; my machines are 10/51s running SunOs 4.1.3,
similar to the previous message.

They loop; each one puts on an average of 1 load point (a nuisance on these
systems) until eventually killed either by me or other checks I run.  The 
last time I saw this was with the occasional X11R4 process; X11R5 doesn't in 
general. It's a nuisance.

I haven't yet noted the 'new' problem. I suspect that will be true as well.

Could it be possible to use some small external program from pine to

We also have been having problems with Pine causing processes gobbling up
cpu time. This is with Pine 3.85 running on a SunOS 4.1.3 computer (called
vega).  I noticed 3 process like this a few weeks ago, one last Sunday and
3 today.  When this first occurred on 1st October, I reported it to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu. 

I haven't managed to track down where the problem lies.  However, it seems
to occur when Pine is trying to write to the screen when the person
running Pine has logged out by some means.  It then seems to get into a
closed loop (aka infinite loop).  I have put the output from SunOS's trace
command for one of the runaway processes below.  The lines given below are
repeatedly output. 

vega# trace -p 4413
Process 4413 attached - interrupt to quit
setitimer (0, 0xefffed28, 0xefffed18) = 0
getpid () = 4413
kill (4413, 1) = - SIGHUP (1)

setitimer (0, 0xefffed28, 0xefffed18) = 0

You write later that your main systems are HP-UX and SunOS. You certainly
don't need a kernel change for these systems!

- For SunOS 4.1.x, chown to another user is *not* allowed, ie it follows
the BSD standard, not the System V standard.

- For HP-UX, chown to another user is by default allowed. It can easily
be turned off by creating /etc/privgroup which contains *one* line:

	-n CHOWN

If you want programs which are setgid to mail (eg. /bin/rmail) to be able
to do chown, you need:

	-n CHOWN
	mail CHOWN

In both cases, extremely easy.

Subject: Problem with sending mail in OLD version of pine

Hi,

I am in the process of building the new version of pine, but right now
we are still running 3.03 (I know, we need to upgrade it).  We have seen
an occasional problem where when someone sends a message, the text of
the message is replaced with the name of the smtp server.   Our smtp
server is smtp.pitt.edu, so the message would be something like:

To: blah
From: la la la
Subject: test
Date:  ...

smtp.pitt.edu

The debug file from a session where this type of message was delivered
looks normal.

We cannot reliably reproduce this.

Is this something that was previously reported and fixed?


	jeff

Both of these are known problems.  The saved message problem will be 
fixed in an upcoming release, but it is not a trivial change.  The 
looping problem on disconnection will be fixed in the upcoming Pine 3.88 
maintenance release.

We've also noticed the same problem here on a Sun 10/30 running SunOS
4.1.3. I hesitated in posting a message to this discussion group, as I
_thought_ that the problem may have been specific to our users connecting
to our Sun host via Novell ethernet.

I've made a quick hack to temporarily solve the problem:

-  Pine (and other programs opening folders) run setgid mail,
   being compiled with SETGID_HACK set.

-  In main() the first thing to do is to save the effective gid,
   and do a setgid(getgid()) (disable the setgid stuff).

-  In the lock and unlock functions I temporarily restore the
   saved effective gid when performing the actual locking/unlocking
   actions.

-  This means that, except for the small pieces of code doing the
   (un)locking, pine runs with the real gid, and opening another
   person's mailbox is impossible.

-  All the stuff still works as before when not running setgid
   mail.  Then the effective gid is the same as the real gid, so all
   setgid() actions are in fact a no-op.

-  I've tested it here with pine, and it seems to work fine.
   I didn't test it with imapd, because I don't use it (yet).

-  I consider it an unelegant hack, but it works.
   I invite everybody to make comments (and test everything
   thoroughly), so that we can suggest it as a standard solution
   to the Pine development team.

Subject: Patch for disabling the Update function
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 93 17:24:57 MET
From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

Because I wanted to disable the Update function that (IMHO)
may confuse our users (and does not work here),
I've made the following patch to be able to disable it at
compile time (macro: DISABLE_UPDATE).

I'ld like to have it be included in future releases of Pine.

Subject: Patch for Pine documentation and groff
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 93 17:20:57 MET
From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

The following patch I made to the pico manual page, because
I had trouble formatting it with groff (groff can handle
macro names longer than 2 characters).

Please consider to include it in the next release of Pine.

Unfortunately this is not a solution.  You are making a common mistake in
assuming that everyone is running sendmail.  There are at least two other
MTA packages that are as good as, or better then, sendmail (e.g. MMDF and
ZMAILER).  Some sites (like us) handle too large a volume of mail to use
sendmail. 

I say let the system administrator worry about it - this is not a new
problem.  I think your time is much better spent on improving the
interface and user-visible functionality of your MUA.

From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

When adding a new entry in the addres book, you get the text

	New full name (last, first) :

I think it's better to let the text be:

	New full name (First Last) :

Because we don't really want a "," in the registered full name.

Subject: Patch for Printer setup screen
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 93 17:32:42 MET
From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

In the file other.c and pine.c two functionally equivalent (static)
functions redraw_printer_select() exist.
The text included in other.c was more generic (it contained also references
to "lp" and "LPDEST", thus being more appropriate for System V systems).

So I made the following patch to make the text in pine.c equal to
that in other.c.

Please include this patch in the next official release.

I got to thinking of somethign that might be nice to have in a future 
version of pine:  filename completion.

Where I'm finding this would be helpful is when I'm reading in a file 
into a piece of mail.  In bash, you can just press TAB and it will 
complete the filename for you.  This would be most helpful to have when 
you have long filenames (or worse, confusing filenames).

Just a thought, anyways.

Pine 3.87 already supports TAB for filename completion.  You can activate 
this by adding enable-tab-completion to the feature-list in your .pinerc.

This is a known problem, caused by a design change which permits saving of
messages to remote folders via IMAP.  Formerly, Pine had internal code to
implement saving; now it uses a generic library routine.  The problem was that
IMAP didn't have a way to support flag preservation, so in the name of
consistency flags were never preserved.  This problem has been resolved.

It is near the top of my high priority list of things to do.  Unfortunately,
it is a ``missing feature'', not a ``bug'', and so it will probably not make
it into Pine 3.88.  We have high hopes for it being in Pine 3.89 or Pine 3.90.

We believe that this problem will be fixed in Pine 3.88.

I don't think it matters to have in the address book menu
(first last) instead of (last, first).  The only difference
is that you have to manually type in the comma.

Also, "," doesn't show up ie:

	New full name (last, first) : Doe, John

cause when you type the nickname in the To: field, it comes out as:

	To: John Doe <userid_address>

Why is it that when I save my incoming file to another folder, the
author for the email is changed to my account name?  Before, in the
old version, I would save mail in one file and type:

	from -f ~/mail/<filename>

it would list the mail items with the proper address it came from,
but with the new version, it changes all the email address of where
it's from to my userid.

	from -f ~/mail/<filename>

	From highway@wam.umd.edu Thu Oct 21 22:02:21 1993
	From highway@wam.umd.edu Thu Oct 21 22:10:52 1993
	From highway@wam.umd.edu Thu Oct 21 23:22:11 1993

Like that... how do I fix that or how do I change settings?

That was considered many years ago.  One problem with doing this is that Pine
is no longer self-contained; you now have to install two programs.

Plus, this doesn't help the case where Pine is user-installed and maintained,
since presumably that external program will run with set[gu]id privileges and
most system managers don't allow random programs to be privileged.

Sorry!  I really thought I'd seen a "," appearing somewhere (maybe
that was in 3.07, which I looked at quickly before moving to 3.87).

It's still questionable whether it makes sense to ask someone to
type in a name in the format "last, first".  Is that a natural way
in the U.S.?  Here the "first last" format is more natural
(in France the format "LAST first" seems to be the default :-)).

The so-called ``author for the email'' -- more specifically, the token that
follows the word ``From '' in an mbox-format header -- is really the ``return
address'' of whatever delivery agent wrote that message.  It may have nothing
to do with the actual sender of the message.

Pine does not use this field, nor do other mailbox formats have this field at
all.  Possibly, we could in a future copy this field in copying from one mbox-
format mailbox to another, but in all other cases (including those involving
IMAP) it is simply impossible.  I don't think that inconsistent behavior is
doing users any favors.

In a sense, it is you who wrote that message into the other folder, not the
agent who wrote it originally into your INBOX.  In mailer architectures where
there may be multiple INBOXes, this can be a significant difference.

The date in the ``From '' header isn't copied either.  This is intentional,
due to the requirement in IMAP that the internaldates be strictly ascending.

Arguably, it is a bug in the Unix ``from'' program that it reports this data
and not the address in the RFC-822 ``From:'' header line.  The from program's
usage dates back from 1970's pre-ARPAnet UNIX, where the mbox ``From '' header
was the only header and a ``network'' was UUCP and 1200-baud phone lines.

Because I couldn't get pine v3.87 to run on on our Challenge XL under
IRIX 5.0.1 I recompiled pine3.07 -- which failed to compile with the
same error message.

Ahah!

I then recompiled it on our 4D/420 under IRIX 4.0.5 and compiled and
ran like the champion it is -- so did v3.87!

The compilation problem comes from /usr/include/time.h which (C
compiler v3.10) has

extern char *   _tzname[];

while version 3.16 has

extern char *tzname[2];

It has apparently taken the good folks at Silicon Graphics 6 patches
to break another piece of software!

One of the users here uses pine indirectly through a dialin... He goes 
from the dialin through ISN through another machine to his.  Thus pine is 
clueless as to the fact that he's calling in at a very slow baud rate and 
needs the '-->' instead of the selection bar... How does one tell pine to 
use the -->?  This is probably a very stupid question with a very simple 
answer, but it's 4:51 in the am...

Is there any way to get PINE to do what Elm does with outgoing mail?
That is to have it saved under the username of the person you are
sending to.

If not, could it be added in a future release?

If he's running on a Unix system and logs on to it through 'rlogin' or
'telnet', he could type 'stty 1200', 'stty 2400', etc.

This would *not* be a good idea if he connected to his system through a
character port, because it would actually change the port speed.  But
if he was connecting through a network port, the 'stty' speed would
just serve to advise Pine that he's running at low speed.

The reason we use "Last, First" is that we sort the addressbook by the 
full name field.  This format makes it easy to get the entries in order 
by last name.

Also, Do you know of any services with trial periods?

Isaias,
A thousand pardons...

We moved the update service to a different machine and didn't get all the 
necessary files copied.  I'll let you know as soon as this is corrected.

Some time ago there was a discussion on ideas to discourage users leaving
their read mail in the inbox.  Would you leave your real mail in your
letter box after reading it?  As a low priority, since I know the pine
team are busy with other more important things, is it possible to have the
option to force all read mail to be moved automatically to the
"saved-messages" folder?

Ah yes.  The newest c-client in the IMAP 3.1 toolkit has this change for
the renamed tzname variable, courtesy of Angel Li.  You can try
substituting it for the one that is in Pine 3.87.  Note that the SGI port
is now an ANSI port instead of a non-ANSI one, so perhaps someting in the
Pine makefile also needs to be changed. 

A pox on vendors who can't maintain source code compatibility from one
release to the next!  ;-)

	I've just put up 3.87 (from 3.01).  Some of my users are
complaining that attached text files are being encoded in BASE64 and
this seems be the case.  I realize the 3.01 use BASE64 if it found any
8 bit charaters or very long lines, but that is not the case here.  If
there any way to change this behavior?

Spike,
This change was a very conscious decision; and hence is a feature, not a 
bug :)  We thought very hard about this one, so let me share the rationale.

Pine provides two ways of sending text files:
  1. By *inclusion*, using the ^R function in the composer
  2. By *attachment*, using ^J or the attchmnt header line.

Text *inclusion* should be used if the recipient does not have MIME support.
Text *attachment* should be used if the recipient *does* have MIME support.

But why change the *attachment* behavior for text files?  Because we
*strongly* believe that any MIME attachment should arrive intact, without
modification of any kind.  The only way we have to guarantee the integrity
of the attachment is to Base64 encode it.  (Q-P encoding is not sufficient.)

Using MIME attachments should be as safe as doing a file transfer.  Once
we learned that q-p encoding was not sufficient in all cases to prevent
modification of the text attachment during transit through gateways or
delivery, we were not willing to jeopardize the reputation of MIME in
general and Pine in particular by using the more "readable" encoding,
especially given that the ^R alternative was always available when
absolute integrity was not needed. 

Note that this problem completely disappears when your correspondents
upgrade to MIME-aware mailers, as we hope they will soon, so that they 
can fully participate in the Internet mail world.

Subject: Attached text always BASE64 encoded?


Thanks for the response, now to offer (possibly) some help...

We're experiencing that reported wild looping when someone hangs up on
Pine (3.87), I used Sun's trace to see what it's looping on (this only
reports syscalls, but perhaps that's useful) and here's what it looks
like:


write (1, "\33[22;1H\33[K", 10) = -1 EIO (I/O error)
write (1, "\33[22;29H\33[7m[ \7Unknown command: ".., 39) = -1 EIO (I/O error)
write (1, "\33[6;18H", 7) = -1 EIO (I/O error)
sigblock (0) = 0
sigstack (0, 0xf7ffead4) = 0
setitimer (0, 0xf7ffead0, 0xf7ffeac0) = 0
getpid () = 20467
kill (20467, 1) = - SIGHUP (1)
sigcleanup () = 0
setitimer (0, 0xf7ffead0, 0xf7ffeac0) = 0
gettimeofday (0xf7ffeae8, 0) = 0
write (1, "\33[22;1H\33[K", 10) = -1 EIO (I/O error)
write (1, "\33[22;29H\33[7m[ \7Unknown command: ".., 39) = -1 EIO (I/O error)
write (1, "\33[6;18H", 7) = -1 EIO (I/O error)

Perhaps one easy fix is that someone, somewhere needs to check for
that error return on the write()? Also, not that it is trying to
kill() itself with a SIGHUP.

Anyhow, perhaps that's helpful.

However, pine is designed for folks that have little awareness of
unix/ms-dos tricks.  If a pine user uploads a file prepared with an
ms-dos editor that leaves a a ctrl-z EOF, or a ctrl-m at the end of
each line, pine makes the determination that this is a binary file,
suitable for BASE64 encoding.  This was documented by one of our users,
Doug Palm, and brought to the development team's attention.  It was
indicated by Dave Miller (I think) that the 'feature' will be
re-designed in the upcoming 3.88 maintenance release, in order to ease
the pain.

We should not assume that pine's users know how to strip these control
characters from uploaded files, or use zip/unzip to remove them, in
order to make them 'true' ascii files, compliant to unix format.  While
this may have been planned as a 'feature', it is rapidly becoming an
adminstrative/helpdesk headache.  Messages posted with pine traverse
many networks, including CompuServe, which is arguably one of the
largest single mail systems around; CIS's mail interfaces do not
provide for MIME attachments, it appears.  While the rest of the world
ramps up to MIME, pine is producing messages that can't be using the
recipient's {traditional,only available} mail reader.

Thanks Barry!

This SIGHUP looping bug is one of several reasons why a pine 3.88 (mtce 
release) will appear much sooner than we planned :(

Probably before the end of next week...

Ralph,
The question of when to encode *in-line* text, as opposed to *attachments*
is definitely distinct, and 3.87 appears to be too aggressive in when it 
encodes in-line text.

I personally feel very strongly that Pine is doing the right thing in 
always encoding *attachments*, but I do not feel that Pine should be 
imposing MIME-ness on everyone else for *in-line* text.  

I need to talk with the team about exactly what will be done, but your
(and Doug's) input on this was received loud and clear.

As an option that could be set either by the user or manager, that
would be like one Berkeley mail has had that saved messages to "mbox".
As a style, however, it can result in people reading mail, not deleting
that mail, and forgetting about it because it goes to another folder.  
Leaving it in the system inbox can encourage people to specifically
delete or save messages, and I believe that more messages are thus
appropriately deleted.

Yes, I had discussions which went along the same kind of reasoning about
the limitations of having read mail moved to another folder.  I suppose we
can't have everything but I still like to handle the inbox like real mail,
anyone who wants to read their real mail has to remove it from their mail
box at home or the office, read it and file it away (includes the rubbish
bin).  Unfortunately, a lot of people don't follow your (and my) nice
habbit of regularly cleaning up the inbox. What better way is there to
force people to clean out their mail than if they reach their disk quota
limit if their read mail is automatically moved to another folder?  The
same happens to me if I don't file away my real mail for more than a week
- my desk starts to look like a rubbish tip and I can't do any work. 
Also, I prefer just one person to suffer disk quota problems than all of
them suffer disk space problems as is the current situation if the
/var/spool/mail area gets filled with bloated inboxes. 

I have in mind to install a cron jobs that will check everyones
"read-messages" folder, their quotas and other things and send a reminder
message about cleaning out their folder(s) before a dangerous level is
reached.  If they want to leave any of their mail after the cleanup in the
"read-messages" folder instead of filing them into appropriate folders
then that's their decision.  That sought of duplicates the
"saved-messages" folder.

Perhaps a suggestion:  when text is yanked in with a CTRL-R, then
process it as-is--do not invoke encoding.  If text is sent as an
attachment, then use whatever encoding scheme prevails.  Or, when text
is yanked in, ask if this should be encoded or processed as-is.  I can
see times where both features would be useful.

Ralph,
There probably doesn't want to be any distinction between what is typed 
in directly and what is included via ^R... the question is what 
conditions should trigger q-p or b64 encoding of the inline text. 

We don't want Pine to be overly obnoxious to non-MIME users, but at the 
same time we want to fulfil the requirements of the MIME RFCs, and make 
sure that Pine does the right thing for our non-US-ASCII friends.

We have been using an algorithmic approach to triggering the inline 
encoding, but the algorithm needs refinement.  Stay tuned...

Subject: How to disable the addition of '@hostname' to addresses?
Date: Sun, 24 Oct 93 16:09:52 MET
From: Jos Vos <jos@bull.nl>

Pine automatically appends an '@' followed by my local hostname
to outgoing addresses without an '@'.
Is there a simple way to disable this (or to hack the code
for this purpose?

In my opinion this is a function of the mail transport agent
(sendmail in our case), not of the mail user agent.

Especially, the "rewriting" of

	hosta!hostb!user
to
	hosta!hostb!user@myhost

I don't like, because this type of addresses often confuses some
mailers (I know it's officially correct).

Jos -

Pine is a RFC-822 syntax mailer.  It is not intended to be a UUCP-syntax 
mailer.  Since Pine runs on DOS configurations as well, it has to take on 
the responsibility of building proper RFC 822 format headers.

If you run sendmail, you can configure your UUCP routing to use RFC-822 
syntax using the Domain Name System, or you can configure sendmail to 
convert RFC-822 syntax to UUCP syntax.

Regards,

Subject: input/output character mapping in Unix-Pine
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

A long time ago I wished for input/output character mapping for Pine
(back then it was UNIX only). Now I see that you have put it in, but
unfortunately for PC only!!

With a slight generalization of this it becomes usable for UNIX as
well. Example; we would use it for users that have old terminals with
ISO 646-SE, the swedish 7bit charset where "{}|[]\" are replaced by
our national characters. I want to map these users input/output
to/from ISO 8859-1 else they can't read mails using 8859/1 and what
they write will become incomprehensible when viewed on a 8bit
terminal. (It'll look like a C-program...)

It seems I could use the PC-mapping stuff if it became enabled for
UNIX as well.

And why are the maps named by two env variables and not by entries in
the pinerc-file like all other options?

It does the right thing when the receiver has MIME, but with the
advance of 8bit SMTP there's no need to QP-encode. BTW, most SMTPs
in Sweden are already hacked to pass 8 bits...

So it would be nice if it was possible to turn the QP feature off,
preferably per composed mail or at least in the rc-file. Put in
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" instead if QP is not used.

99% of my contacts does not have MIME-capabale readers yet.  They are
mostly users and have not a slightest idea on how to install metamail"
nor Pine. They get terribly confused by all this =E5 stuff...
Especially the line-breaking!  (they are sort of used to see all kinds
of weird characters instead of our national characters...)

So, in short; Pine should offer all these nice MIMEifications, they
come to great use in-house and between MIME-compliant mailers but as
most of the email world doesn't do MIME yet, please make the encoding
stuff more configurable.

We have Sendmail running, using UUCP to the outside world and SMTP
in our internal network.  And our Sendmail *does* use domain addresses
as much as possible.

But: that's just the reason that I don't want Pine to mungle headers.
Our Sendmail takes its own decisions to change headers.

I don't think you understand what is going on inside Pine.

Pine does not ``mungle'' headers.  Pine accepts input and parses it into a
structured representation of that particular field.  While doing so, it
does services such as address book lookup, etc.  When the message it sent,
it generates a header from that structured representation.  The original 
input is not used at all.

This structured representation includes a ``hostname'' subfield in the
case of an address field.  This is not an optional field.  It gets filled
in with the local domain if it is not specified.  The alternative is to
give you an error message if you don't specify a hostname; I don't think
anyone wants that! 

There have been many problems caused by mail programs which fail to set up
fully-qualified e-mail addresses prior to sending the mail.  The Internet
e-mail development mailing list archives are filled with horror stories of
such dating from at least 1977.  The potential for user confusion and
technical problems with incomplete e-mail addresses is *enormous*.

What you are really asking is not ``make Pine not mungle headers''.  In 
actuality, you are saying ``make Pine use exactly what the user typed in 
instead of generating proper Internet format, and trust that sendmail 
will mungle the headers to be valid.''

Please consider moving your UUCP network towards using the domain name
system via MX records instead of UUCP routing syntax.  This is a more
robust system and is better supported by modern e-mail tools such as Pine. 
I do not see any means that we can make the hostname field optional in
addresses without inflicting 16+ years' worth of documented horrors on
novice users.

Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking.
Sendmail is much better occupied for that job than any mail user agent.

We *do* use domain addresses for almost all destinations (even UUCP hosts).
But in some cases people use, for whatever reason, use an UUCP-path.

When one receives mail from a list (i.e. mail not sent directly to one... 
there's a cool sentence for ya...)  is it possible that pine could ask 
one whether it should grab (when one uses the TakeAddr command) the 
address of the sender or the address of the To: line?  This would be cool 
for saving the addresses of mailing lists...

Hello, 

If I use pine with aixterm window size 108x57 the header line will be written
to line 0 and the content of the window is garbagged. (The cursor is not
where it should be!) If I use ctrl-l the correct content will be displayed,
but if I fill in text in the the header region it is again garbagged. 

Resizing the window to 107x57 or 109x57 will give correct contents and no 
garbage! Isn't it funny that only a x-size of 108 characters will have an 
effect and I have set my default size to just 108 characters?

Kind Regards
Guenter

Mark is exactly right about using fully qualified domain names in the
headers generated by Pine.  It would be nice if all MUAs did the same. 
Please don't change it.

Mixed bang and @ addresses are a bad thing because they are ambiguous
in meaning.  Users probably should not be generating full bang paths
either.  The topology of the uucp network tends to change more rapidly
than most people's knowledge of it.  If one needs to use bang paths
for delivery then the MTA should generate them and not the user.

There have long been MTAs that can both handle domain style addresses
to uucp sites and generate the correct bang path for delivery from the
uucp maps.  People who use uucp should use that software and not
burden programs like Pine with those problems.

	I must say that I fully agree with Mark.  Even to this day I see
broken mailers and broken sendmails were mail shows up on my doorstep
in the form user@hostname...and they are no where close to being in my
domain.  

	You are making a bad assumption about sendmail since I think you
are also assuming that everyone knows how to properly configure it to
follow the rules.  I can add to the "horror" stories that prove it bad
a bad assumption.

	For pine to be the mailer it wants to be, i.e. the mailer of
choice for the non-techincal, it needs to make inteligent decisions
based upon standards.  I personally find that to be commended.
Not only that...it helps to reduce the "mistakes" made by even the
most techie mail user.

	Within our local network we use SMTP, IMAP, POP2, POP3 and UUCP[B
as protocols.  For ease of making routing decisions and getting
everything to interoperate...we don't fool around we simply use
fully qualified domain names all of the time.  The only thing we have
is a "fire wall" that strips off the host part from all mail escaping
our domain.

	If you want a mailer to do as you requested....try /bin/mail :-)

Since many existing mail programs support only uuEncode/uuDecode (CCMAIL,
DaaVinci) AND since pine sends attachments as BASE64, could you provide 
the a source for BASE64 on MS WINDOWS, DOS, and for the MACintosh - thus 
allowing those poor unfortunates the ability to decode pine's BASE64 
attachments???

Chris Newman and I are pleased to announce the release of mpack 1.0

Mpack and munpack are utilities for encoding and decoding
(respectively) binary files in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) format mail messages.  In short, they are the MIME
equivalent of uuencode and uudecode.  For compabibility with older
forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format.

Mpack/munpack are minimally MIME-conformant and support the
Content-MD5: header.

Thank you for your bug report, and please accept our apologies for the
difficulty you encountered.

Without additional information (such as a core dump) we cannot investigate the
cause of this crash further.  The message reported that an internal
consistency check in a library called by Pine failed; however by itself that
doesn't help us much.

However, we believe that we have identified a bug in Pine which caused this
error.  This problem should be fixed in Pine 3.88.  We expect to release Pine
3.88 in the very near future.  If it happens to you again and you get a core
dump, please let us know (and if possible forward the dump to us).

Thank you for your continued interest in Pine.

Regards,

-- Mark --

Sorry, my apologies to everyone.  There was no core dump.  It simply quit 
pine, leaving no process existing.  Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.  I 
was just leaving the system and I wanted to quickly post the error 
message before I forgot it.

Probably a FAQ. If so, sorry...

When I forward a message from ALL-IN-1 through PMDF to a UNIX machine, it
looks like what you see below. The problem is that Pine (3.85) hides the
"Sender" header when displaying the attachment. But without the Sender
header, users can't easily see who originated the forwarded message. How
can you un-hide headers in Pine?  -Thanks!

I seem to recall having seen some messages about this before but as we 
were not having the trouble then I did not save them. Apologies if this 
has been answered.

We are running the imapd that was bundled with pine 3.87 on a Sun ELC 
with SunOS 4.1.2. We had not noticed any problems with this until today 
when I noticed that I often logged in to see the message "You have mail" 
when it should have been telling me I had new mail. On investigation I 
saw that an imapd process I had started hours earlier was still running.
The reason this had not been noticed before was that I normally keep a 
window open all day, but today I was working from home and coming over a 
modem (so naturally only staying logged on when necessary).

Can someone please let me know whether this has now been fixed or do we 
have to wait until pine 3.88

A more worrying sympton is that I also had mail completely disappear. I 
logged on to see the elm "frm" command reporting I had one message - I 
was doing something else (not running pine) and then ran "frm" again - 
this time to see no messages! Again I discovered there was an impad 
process running from a previous session. I seem to recall that there had 
been problems with Sun sendmail and imapd earlier but I thought these had 
been fixed.

By the way, I also pulled the latest imap.tar.Z - the compilation for the 
sun build fails with:

"mtx.c", line 706: SEEK_SET undefined

I am used to several email systems that use a wastbasket for deleted messages. 
This wastebasket holds deleted messages for either a period of time (specified)
or until manually purged.  The wastebasket is just a folder which one can go
back to and reread a deleted message.
I like this feature and have not found this in Pine.
Have I just missed it?  If not, I would like to suggest it is a future option.

This seems to be consistant with what happens when you have a living Pine
reading your mail.  Normally, imapd commits suicide within 30 minutes of the
Pine end vanishing (assuming an explicit logout wasn't done).

Are you sure the message really disappeared, as opposed to merely no longer
being marked as new?  Are you sure that that ``imapd process running from a
previous session'' isn't talking to a living Pine that is checkpointing?  Did
you check your /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog file (or wherever sendmail logs are
kept) to see if there are any unaccounted-for messages that were delivered to.

Please check out these possibilities.

Please change the SEEK_SET reference in mtx.c to L_SET.  This will be fixed in
the next version of imap.tar.Z.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

A nice feature found in some other editors is the ability to use wild
cards when specifying the filename at the ^R (read file) option.  A screen
similar to the ^T (to files) option should then appear for selection
unless there's only one file that matches anyway.

It appears that PINE tries to contact the rshd on the imapd host even if 
the "passwordless" access feature of PINE is not being used.  I noticed 
this when I commented out rshd in inetd.conf on my mailhub (a bit of 
firewalling) -- connections to the server took about a minute to complete 
(from the "Opening INBOX" message to the userid prompt) with rshd 
disabled.  Connections establish in about 2 seconds with rshd enabled.  
Why is PINE (if it is) trying to talk to rshd even when not doing rsh 
authentication?

There is no way for Pine to know whether or not it is using rsh based 
authentication unless it tries it.  It sounds to me that your rsh client 
is timing out rather than getting a connection refused error.

Hi!

I have a question on Pine. we are trying to print from a Mac using Telnet
2.5 and an Imagewriter attached to it directly to the Phone line. I used
the option in Pine "attached to ansii" and tried to print, it tells me it
is printing, but nothing comes out. Print selection works. Do you have any
suggestions for me?? Are other people able to print??

Also do you know if Pine for RS6000 is here?

Thanks a lot in advance,
Mahbuba

I dial in occasionally from my Mac at home using Microphone and print to a

I just upgraded from pine 3.07 to 3.87 (for our campus wide File 
Server for Sun4, Solaris, Ultrix, RS6000, HP 9000 (700+800) and NeXt).

And I'm happy about the new features, our users as well, hopefully :-)

One little thing I detected which disturbs me:

[No default command in Message View Screen] -- when I press RETURN while 
viewing a message.

Could this be changed?

I posted a discussion of this a while back, but I believe it got buried 
under the flood of mail accompanying the 3.85 relase of the Pine package.

I'm wondering about possibilities of encorporating abilities into Pine 
that will allow you to utilize the security features of PGP.  Most 
specifically would be the ability to add a digital signature to your 
outgoing mail (pgp -s filename), and perhaps later the ability to check 
the 'To:' field and match those names to your public keyring.

In theory, I don't think it would be that difficult to do.  Simple that 
before the file is sent on its way, the headers should be stripped and 
then the signature would be added, then reattached to the headers and 
sent out.  It's an operation that could take place invisibly to the user.

Right now, the only way to sign a message is to create it outside of 
Pine, sign it, and then read it in, which is really cumbersome for spur 
of the moment creation of messages.

I appreciate your time.

Local printing requires that your communication program be able to handle the
excape sequences that Pine sends and then route the text to a printer. The Pine
docs say that this is possible on the Mac with some comm programs (I think they
mention VersaTerm, and it looks like Microphone works, too). I know that Telnet
won't work.

Telnet does allow you to select text on the screen and then print the selection.
Unfortunately, Pine does it's scrolling in a way that doesn't let Telnet capture
text that has "scrolled past". Thus you can't scroll back through your Telnet
window and select more than one screenful of your message (for printing or
copying). This is one of the few advantages of elm and the reason some of our
users haven't switched to Pine. 

I don't think this lack of scrollback capture is a Pine "bug", I think it's just
related to how tightly integrated the interface is.

Is there an easy way to get PINE to recognize these Email messages???

I have a user who accidently invoked an older mail package that stored 
each of 80 some odd messages as individual files with a different order 
to each of the "From:" "To:" etc... for example:

Hmm, that would be great. I've got the latest NCSA Telnet and it still doesn't
seem to work (LaserWriter driver 8.0 and a LaserWriter). The printer config
screen in Pine says the following:

1. Printer attached to IBM PC or compatible, MacIntosh
   This may not work with all attached printers, and will depend on the
   terminal emulation/communications software in use. It is known to work
   with Versaterm Pro on Macs, and WRQ Reflections on PC's and with the
   latest UW version of NCSA telnet for either, and probably Kermit too.
          Command: attached-to-ansi

Does UW have some further modified versions of Telnet for the Mac? I know that
Telnet 2.6 is in the works from NCSA, but I don't believe it's 
released yet.

When users export to a file, if the file exists, they are asked about 
appending.  If the user does not wish to append, most programs will 
request a new name be supplied.  We have had users who when they 
indicated they did not want to append thought that the original file was 
overwritten (replaced) by the new message. In fact nothing has happened.

If they had the option to supply a name instead of simply returning them 
to their document, they could then supply a different name.

NCSA Telnet v2.5x for the Macintosh DOES understand the ASCII printing escape
sequences. When you select Print ('Y') from pine, you should get the normal
print dialog box. If you Cancel the print dialog, you should get the option to
spool the job for later printing.

Subject: Re: Ascii printing in Pine

Local printing requires that your communication program be able to handle the
excape sequences that Pine sends and then route the text to a printer. The Pine
docs say that this is possible on the Mac with some comm programs (I think they
mention VersaTerm, and it looks like Microphone works, too). I know that Telnet
won't work.

Telnet does allow you to select text on the screen and then print the
selection.
Unfortunately, Pine does it's scrolling in a way that doesn't let Telnet
capture
text that has "scrolled past". Thus you can't scroll back through your Telnet
window and select more than one screenful of your message (for printing or
copying). This is one of the few advantages of elm and the reason some of our
users haven't switched to Pine. 

I don't think this lack of scrollback capture is a Pine "bug", I think it's
just
related to how tightly integrated the interface is.

Frank,
We held off having a default action for Message Text until we had a 
chance to come up with a spiffier "attachment selection" interface.
There *will* be a default action as soon as this is available.

I have noticed something that I think is backwards?
When displaying email with the HdrMode off (i.e. the short form) I notice that
my id in the to: field contains the complete domain spec:

To: DRYFO001@mc.duke.edu, jdd@mcismvs.mc.duke.edu

However, if I press H and turn on full headers, it is shortened:

To: DRYFO001, jdd@mcismvs.mc.duke.edu

This is no big deal, just seems opposite from what I would expect.

Full Headers mode displays the raw message as it was recieved.  With Full 
Headers off, Pine parses then reconstructs the headers into a fully 
qualified canonical form.  Full Headers mode might actually be better 
described as Raw Message mode...

Attached is a message one of our faculty received.  She (username: 
sscher) was trying to get some information from a listserv and 
incorrectly entered the To: address.  Needless to say, the message was 
returned to her, but if you look at the From: line of the unsent 
message, it says that this message was sent by pchang, not ssher.  I 
tried to replicate the problem with no luck.  There is a user pchang on 
this system, but he has never logged in.  No one else had this problem.  
The syslog entries for this and a few more similiar messages look normal.
The password entries for each look okay also.  We're running ULTRIX 4.3 
and Pine 3.87.

Any ideas, suggestions?

Is there any possibility that pchang and ssher have the same user number?

I checked that out first thing.  They both have very different user IDs.  
ssher's account was created last year and pchang's acct was created on 
October 22.

We've seen exactly the same thing here, with Pine 3.07 and Ultrix 4.2 (A?).
In this case, the messages with the strange headers appeared in the user's
sent-mail folder, with the name of a user of an account I had created a
few hours earlier.  The user has no idea what she did, and the debug files
didn't look out of line.

I recently discovered that Pine's save and extract operations rewrite the
"Unix from line" of a message with my own address and the time of the
operation.  Can this possibly be a feature? 

This is with V3.85 on a Convex and V3.87 on an SGI.

Thanks,

Hi all.  I've ported (sorta) 3.87 to NetBSD-0.8.  It was fairly easy....i 
just changed a couple of things.  But...the problem is that it doesn't 
work. :(

It compiles and runs fine, but when I run it, the mail i send just 
vaporizes.  At least as far as I can tell, i send the mail, and it never 
gets anywhere.  (I can't even send to users on the same machine).  I can 
see the message briefly pass through /usr/spool/mqueue, but then nothing. 

I think that The .pinedebug files are indicating that all went well.  No 
errors.

sendmail works ok, i can use ucb mail, and i had an old version of pine 
running (3.05), but it got deleted a while back.
I can't figure out why it's doing this.  I'm including my .pinedebug file 
below.

Thanx...alex...

You could try some debugging by altering the source so that it stops after
it creates the /tmp/pinesend123456 file and returns NULL.  Then you could
look at that file (the input to sendmail) to see if it looks right and try
running it through sendmail with sendmail verboseness and debugging turned
on.  If your syslog is working you might be able to find some mention of
the sendmail problem, there, too.

Alternatively, you could try setting the smtp-server to some other SMTP 
host and see if avoiding the local sendmail fixes it for you.

Someone posted a message the other day about users (apparently) getting 
other people's mail. Could they re-send that message to me please? We 
have a similar problem.

I have a couple of questions about pine and filters for mail folders.  
I'm not a programmer, just a user, so please keep responses "basic," and 
excuse me if the questions are FAQs.  I know there was some discussion on 
this list earlier about filters, but I was not focusing on it at that time.

I receive mail from several mailing list, and would like to have the
incoming mail from these lists routed to a folder just for that list or
topic.  Can this be done?  If so, how?  I've read the technical notes,
help menus on pine and looked at examples in the .pinerc file, but still
cannot figure out how to do this.  

An example.  I receive incoming mail messages from a list
ROOTS-L@VM1.NoDak.edu and would like to have new incoming messages from
this list got directly into a folder called "roots" instead of into my
INBOX.  How would I configure the .pinerc file to get the incoming mail
messages from this source to be filtered/routed into my folder called
roots instead of to my INBOX?  

Thanks very much.  Appreciate any help.  If this is something not of
interest to others, you can just e-mail me direct rather than to the list.

initial-keystroke-list
----------------------
When setting initial-keystroke in .pinerc to present mail sorted by arrival 
(reversed to get new messages at top of index) as in:
 
initial-keystroke-list=i,$,r

Gives rise to the following `error' :

Can't mix characters and function keys in
"initial-keystroke-list", skipping.

If, however, the `$' is quoted with `\' as in

initial-keystroke-list=i,\$,r

Pine behaves as expected.


New version message
-------------------
It would be helpful to reserve the `new pine version' welcome message for
versions of Pine that are FUNCTIONALLY different from previous versions
because displaying this message for `maintenance' releases may lead to
confusion, i.e. a user asking "What's new in this version?".



Dave

PS I forgot to mention the above points are Pine 3.87 on DYNIX/ptx 2.0.4,
but I suspect are generic.

YES!  I would very much like a primer on mail filters.
I think they are implemented via the .forward file -- not .pinerc.
(cf the 'vacation' program)
Is there any thorough & understandable documentation on the uses 
of the .forward file?  Other than "read the source code"?  
... and on available filter programs and how to use them ???  -mr

John,

I have been using a program called "procmail".  This program will allow 
you to assign any sort of function for your incoming mail, based on what 
is in the headers.  For example, I have all mail that has a From line of 
"owner-pine-info" go into a folder in ~/mail/pine-info.  You can download 
this program from archie.  I'm no programmer either, but if you need some 
help drop me a line.

TO THE PINE TEAM:

As you can see I have mail from different people or mailing lists go into
folders.  My gripe is that when I enter the folder, the "current" message
is the very last one.  I would expect this to be the first *new* message,
ie the one with the lowest number marked with an "N".  I believe this is
how it works for the INBOX.  By the way, I'm running 3.87 on a
Sun4m/Solaris 1.1.

John,

	This is not something that is done in pine.  It is not included
in the pine package.  

	I use the "filter" routine supplied as part of the elm package.
Another alternative, I'm told, is procmail. 

	I'm happy with the "filter" from elm.  It can store messages
in folders according to Subject:, To:, From:, and other things.  You
can also start a process depending on those same fields.

I use and recommend using the 'filter' program that comes with elm.  It 
is a very functional filter program and can easily handle by 65 or so 
defined filter fields I have set up.  (also makes a great kill file for 
mailing lists :-)

Elmar,
If you filter your incoming into folders defined in the "incoming-folders="
variable of your pinerc, and open them via that section of your List 
Folders screen, you'll get the behavior you want.

The incoming-folders idea was exactly for this delivery filter case, or 
where you have inboxes on multiple machines, and accordingly the initial 
message is set to the first new one.

In the saved-message folders, the last msg is thought to be more often of
interest, and until the IMAP2bis extension is implemented that permits
copying the message-state flags, looking for the first "New" msg is not
very useful anyway.

I didn't know about the 'incoming-folders' parameter in the .pinerc file.
A tutorial on how to use it would be very helpful.  -mr

My old (3.05?) .pinerc file was "Updated by Pine(tm) 3.87" when the new 
version was installed.  I recently discovered that some of the 
information contained in a 'brand-new' pine 3.87 .pinerc file did not 
make it into my old 'updated' file.  Specifically, the last 4 lines of 
the introductory paragraph (beginning with "For a variable to be unset 
it's value must be blank. ...") are missing from my 'updated' file.

Also the section headers do not appear; such as:
   ####...#### Essential Parameters ####...####
This may be difficult because I had rearranged the order of entries in my 
.pinerc file, so that all changed entries would be at the top of the file.

Also the description of parameters WAS -NOT- UPDATED!  My old 'updated' 
file still contained:
   # Sub directory in users home directory where mail folders/files are kept
   # mail-directory=
   mail-directory=Mail
(which I had changed so that all my directories begin with Capital 
Letters -- to segregate them from ordinary files).

In a 'brand-new' 3.87 .pinerc file, the definition of this parameter is:
   # mail-directory is where postponed & interrupted msgs are held temp'y

QUESTION:  Under pine 3.87, if I want the directory 'mail' to be fully 
replaced by the directory 'Mail', are these the only changes required ?
   folder-collections=Mail/[]
   mail-directory=Mail

REQUEST:  Is it possible in future, to do a more thorough job of updating 
the .pinerc file?  It would be helpful to alert users to changes in 
.pinerc which might affect them -- especially if .pinerc contains user 
changes.

Thanks, -mr

If you get the elm software, in the doc subdirectory, there is a 
Filter.guid which I found very helpful in implementing filters for one 
of our users.

Thanks Rick, we are using successfully your tools.  However, we wonder
if there is also a tool for VM's "names" conversion.

I'm curious to know is there is a way to send mail from the command line 
to a distribution in the addressbook.  I have several scripts that I run 
automatically periodically to mail out FAQs and other things.  
Unfortunately, there is a series of mailing that I end up sending 
manually to a large (~150 person) distribution.  I'm just wondering if 
there is a way to do it from the command line so I can slap it into my 
script and be done with it.

Thanks much.

I have a couple of pine-format mailing lists that I mail to...the one I 
use most is called "og"...

To mail to it I type:

pine og

(I have pine aliased to pine -zi and am using version 3.87 with the 
command line fix from 3.85)

Later...

When using pico for editting news articles, it has this annoying tendency 
to automatically clip long references lines into two smaller lines, so 
that I have to change them back to one line before it's a legal article 
again...  This was not in the pico that came with 3.07... (i.e. the pico 
from 3.07 didn't divide the references line)... Can the 3.87 pico be 
changed back to the 3.07 pico behavior??

I have such a tool.  It is a Bourne shell script which relies heavily on 
awk (well, nawk actually).  Anybody who wishes a copy can drop me a line 
in e-mail.  I'd be happy to share.

I am in the process of re-coding the utility in C, with a grammar 
constructed using lex & yacc.  I'm a ways off on that, however (I'm a 
yacc novice).

Pine does not really "understand" the comments in the .pinerc.  When
updating an old .pinerc, the old comments are preserved as much as
possible to preserve any comments the user has inserted or modified. 
We plan to make Pine smarter about comments at some point in the
future...

Unless you have some other setting, like read-message-folder,

Subject:      Binaries for AIX 3.2
To: pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu

I  am running  AIX 3.2.3  and can  build pine/pico  just fine  using the
'build a32';  however, when  I run  pine almost anything  I do  causes a
IOTrap abend with core dump. It appears  that this is a problem with the
AIX 3.2.3  system which  according to  reports out  in NetLand  does not
occur with AIX 3.2.4.

I  ftp-ed  your  aix32  binaries  but  they  have  the  problem  of  not
recognizing my  'vt220' terminal. There is  a simple fix for  this and I
would like  to request a re-build  of the aix32 binaries  (pine/pico) to
solve  the problem.  The only  change  needed is  to the  'makefile.a32'
files and that is just an insertion  of "-lcurses" into the LIBES as the
first library.  It should look like:
    LIBES = -lcurses -ltermcap -lc
instead of:
    LIBES = -ltermcap -lc
when this is done it should link without problems *and* recognize all
the vtXXX's normally known to AIX.

If you  could rebuild those binaries  with the -lcurses I  would be very
grateful!

BTW:  All my  correspondence  to  the pine  lists  have  been from  this
account which is  an IBM VM/ESA System running RiceMail  (MUA) and LMail
(MTA) -- which does  not support MIME at this time.  I have no Pine/Pico
available at this time on any of my machines.... and I really need it
on my RS/6000 AIX 3.2.3 units.

I'd like to read news from the Pine mailreader.  How can I convince Pine 
to look in a non-conventional place for news?

Instead of /usr/spool/news, I keep my news in /usr/news/spool.  This is 
on the local system (no NNTP or IMAP needed).

Any help or hints are appreciated.

Mime-Version: 1.0

I have been using pine (albeit 3.85, as that's the last linux port that I 
have--awaiting 3.88) via imap.  It appears that if I close the remote 
mailbox and exit the host and rather invoke the remote host again via 
imap, that I am not prompted for a userid or password.

Is there some type of 'hidden authentication' still in effect that would 
not allow someone 'posing' as me to log in via imap and access my mailbox 
during this brief period.  It seems that if I exit the host and look at 
[INBOX] as a new folder and then go back to the remote host, all's well.

Possibly, I'm seeing that pine is still connected via imap and doesn't 
actually close the connection until a new folder is opened.

Ideas?

You can edit the c-client/os_???.h file for your system and change 
the definition of NEWSSPOOL, then rebuild.

Or, you can provide a symbolic link to /usr/spool/news.

A folder remains open until you exit pine or open another folder, the 
exception being the INBOX which remains open until you exit Pine.  Is 
this what you are seeing?

Users of our system would like to find out about other users on the 
system, for example when they cannot remember their e-mail ID. If they 
also use the underlying UNIX system, finger does it for them. If they 
only use PINE on a PC, they have to exit PINE, use finger, then go back 
in to send the mail. It would be nice to have a "finger" option available 
on PINE's menu.
This can only be classed as an "it would be nice" item for the wishlist.
Since MAISTROM does it on the MAC, I assume that all the necessary IMAP 
features are already present.

Subject: INBOX again: BSD-mail-mbox model not allowed?
Date: Tue, 02 Nov 1993 15:11:04 +0100
From: Peter Svanberg <psv@nada.kth.se>

I've tried to read all about INBOX in the documentation and in
old messages on this list. Conclusions:

1) It is impossible to get the BSD-mail behavior with BSD-
   format usage in PINE - i.e. that incoming, read and unread
   mail is handled in _one_ file, which is not in
   /usr/spool/mail. 

2) With Tenex-format usage - on the other hand - this behavior
   is the default: /usr/spool/mail contents is silently moved to
   the mail.TxT file.

Questions:

3) Is the silently-moving model considered bad for _all_ users?
   In what way?

4) If so, why is that model still used with Tenex? If not, why
   not allow it in BSD-format usage also?

At least, I think, the documentation should warn, tell and
explain about this big difference for users used to the
BSD-mail program. I have not found anything about it.

Finger is not a function of IMAP.  We are planning to add support for 
directory services, which might include some form of access to finger 
as well.

You can get this behavior by linking the mbox driver into Pine.  This 
is the Berkeley format (bezerk) driver with silent moving added.

Thanks - works fine!

BTW, I saw there has been some progress to the MH driver - any
change in the will-maybe-work-some-day plans I was told before?

The only ``hidden authentication'' in Pine/imapd is that if you can rsh 
to the remote host for free, you can imap to it for free.  In other 
words, the answer is NO.

This can happen.  The primary INBOX is always kept open, and secondary 
streams can be recycled to open new folders.

This is correct with unmodified Pine.

If you modify the .../pine/pine.c file to have a line of
	mail_link (&mboxdriver);
before the mail_link() call for bezerkdriver (you may also have to add 
mboxdriver in the list of driver externals elsewhere), then you will get 
that behavior.

mbox is like tenex, but it uses the /usr/spool/mail format.

This is correct.

Some people find it objectionable, which is why mboxdriver is normally 
turned off.

This model is the only model meaningful for Tenex.  But, because some 
people find mail.txt to be a dangerous name, it was changed to mail.TxT.

I've just compiled 3.87 for linux.  We're up to speed now.  All that 
remains is to work on the the .pinerc file (beginning to resemble a 
sendmail.cf file to some degree with all the options available).

Thanks to you and David Miller.  The pieces to the puzzle are now easier to 
put together.
