This cannot be touted enough. This is where IMAP really kills POP.

Try reading a 2-Meg MIME messages over a 9k6 SLIP link with POP - can you 
say SLOW??? I knew you could ;-)

Try reading a 2-Meg MIME message over IMAP - where you read the 10-line 
text part, and decide to leave the PostScript attachment on the server 
until you get back to the LAN. Can you say FAST?

I still think all other work on IMAP should be stopped until the

Help... is there any way to "activate" ^Z in Pico (or any other key

(no problem with pine, unless... I'm editing mail with pico, in which 
case I need to use ^O -postpone- and then ^Z... but if  I'm using pico as 
an editor in my shell or in tin... I couldn't find a way to do that...)

btw my shell is tcsh... (and as long I don't see any .picorc probably I 
will need to edit my .login or my .cshrc)

Subject: Pine, AIX, and lock-ups
Date: 1 Aug 1994 15:45:41 GMT
Message-Id: <31j5b5$rdo@news.ysu.edu>

I've installed V3.89 of pine on AIX 3.2.2.  I'll say up front that I don't
use pine, I installed it because my newer users wanted something "better"
or "easier" than elm/vi... but with the problems I'm having, neither they
nor I are convinced (one of them is ready to go back to the mainframe for
e-mail, she's at least sympathetic to the problems).

When I first installed pine, my users were having serious lock-up problems.
With the assistance of Jeff Scarborough (scarboro@quit.Colorado.EDU) I
put a patch on C-Client's bezerk.c to make it less vulnerable to AIX xlc
problems, and Pine doesn't lock up when they go to read e-mail.

Replies (or composing new outgoing e-mail) is another story.  Users pick the
letter they want to reply to, press 'r' to reply, the header is all filled
in, and they go to the text area and it freezes.  Ctl-Q and Ctl-C don't help,
I usually have to kill -HUP their process.

This particularly happens to users on high-speed modems through a terminal
server, but occasionally to users running FTP Software telnet over ethernet
as well.

How can I find out what's going on ?  Set a higher debug level ?  Start
using Pine for myself ?  What do I look for ?  Any suggestions (dumping AIX
isn't a viable one, sorry) ?

First, I've set pine to be my default mail reader-sender.  This way perhaps
I'll see what problems people are having...

One observation so far, but it seems more relevant to retrieving mail from
the mailbox than replying to it:

Since pine is not setgid mail, it cannot create <userid>.lock in the mail
spool directory, /usr/spool/mail.  This lock-file is created if pine is run
as root, but not otherwise. 

Based on my experience with elm, there's a lot of futzing around involved
before I can make pine setgid mail.  I've not looked at making /usr/spool/mail
world-writable with the sticky-bit set - that's how /tmp and /var/tmp are
set up on this machine.

>From the upcoming FAQ:

I keep getting the message "unparsable date" when I receive messages. What
does it mean and how do I fix it? 

Pine parses the date and time in the UNIX mbox "From " line in order to
determine an "internal date" for each message. One of the components of this
date and time is the offset from Universal Time. 

Certain older mailers write a symbolic timezone name instead of the more
modern numeric offset. The problem with symbolic timezone names is that such
names are ambiguous. Is BST "Bering Standard Time" or "British Summer Time"?
Is KST in Korea or Kuwait? etc. 

The routine mail_parse_date() in pine/imap/c-client/mail.c knows how to parse
some, but not all, of these symbolic timezones. We recommend that you modify
this routine to add support for your own local timezone. Due to the ambiguity
problem, however, it is unlikely that we will add any more symbolic timezones
in the distribution sources. But, hopefully, this will only be a minor
editing consideration for you. 

The correct solution is to undertake the transition from symbolic timezone
names to numeric timezone values. UNIX software is definitely moving in this
direction due to the ambiguity problem, and has been doing so for several
years now.

Some sites deliver mail to home directories, rather than the system default
of /var/spool/mail/username or whatever.  Imapd seems to cope with this well
enough but ipop3d does not.  I suggest a change a bit like this in the function
myusername, part of env_unix.c:

myHomeDir = cpystr (pw->pw_dir);
#ifdef HOME_DELIVERY
  sprintf(tmp, MAILFILE, myHomeDir);
#else
  sprintf(tmp, MAILFILE, myUserName);

the intention being that if HOME_DELIVERY is defined, MAILFILE will be a sprintf
template for mailboxes located in home directories.

If it was saved from Pine, you should be able to open the file as a folder
and extract the MIME.  Use "Goto" then enter the pathname of the file, if it
isn't in your mail directory.

I don't see anything amiss in your .pine-debug output.  The "-1" just means
that there was no new mail.  It is checking every 2.5 minutes like it is
supposed to, so everything looks normal from that standpoint.  Does this
problem occur every time?

Pine will support encryption in the future, but the exact implementation is

The system aliases are normally applied by sendmail, which is called by Pine
when you send a message.  Pine 3.90 will support multiple addressbooks, so
you could convert your aliases file to a global addressbook if you so
desire...

Which imap should I use? IMAP 3.4 or the one comes with pine 3.89

if I use IMAP 3.4?

In general, unless you are a developer or need the very latest and greatest
IMAP, you should use the IMAP that comes with Pine.  The IMAP distribution is
a separate release, primarily for hackers; often it was bit literally minutes
after edits were made to the development sources.  The Pine distribution, on
the other hand, is carefully beta and field-tested prior to release.

Sometimes the IMAP distribution will have bugfixes that a site will need for
Pine; but usually we'll advise a site if this is the case.

Pine 3.90, which should be coming out very soon, will have the latest IMAP
distribution.

Also, IMAP 3.4 will probably be the last version build upon IMAP2 (RFC 1176)
and IMAP2bis.  IMAP 4.0 will support IMAP4, an updated version of the IMAP
protocol that we hope will become IETF Standards-Track later this summer.

Replace the date-parsing macro in bezerk.h with a function that
correctly parses the "From " lines.  The macro author made
rather optimistic assumptions about the lengths of From line
fields.

Hello.

I'm a recent pine convert and I'm setting pine up for students to
use here at our campus on a unix machine.  To my surprise, I find
that pine and pico were already running on our VMS machine as part
of the PMDF suite of mail programs.  This was an added bonus.

When running pine on VMS, I found the PMDF people had incorporated 
DECspell into pico.  This is a good idea as DECspell is a very good spell 
checker.  I'd like to incorporate ispell into the unix version--it's not 
quite as good, but it does prompt for user input.

I looked at the spell.c code and realize it is possible, but I'll have
to learn how to trash the current edit buffer and replace it with the
temp file.  Not impossible, but I was wondering if someone had done it
already.  (I grabbed the only VMS source code I could find, but it doesn't
give a hint on doing this.)

By the way, my motivation is my dyslexic son who really needs a prompting
speller.  In his case, it's not a matter of simple typos--if he misspelled
a word once he'll likely have no idea how to spell it the second time 
either.  Hence something like DECspell or ispell, which prompts and corrects
the whole document, is critical.

Hi,
Because I vary locations to check my e-mail quite frequently, I usually
use pine to read my e-mail through IMAP protocol.  It is a pretty neat
software.  One of the nice features is it can automatically save the
outgoing mails in the IMAP mail server.  I am thinking about using
mailstrom to read my e-mail if I use a Mac to access my mail server. 
Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any feature in the mailstrom
which allows me to save the outgoing mails in my IMAP mail server.  Is it
possible to do this?  I know it can be saved as a local file, but I prefer
to save the outgoing mails generated by mailstrom along with the previous
outgoing mails in the mail server.  It will be more organized this way. 
If this feature is not available in mailstrom, is there any IMAP-based Mac
mailreader software available (shareware or commercial) for doing this? 
Thanks in advance.

Let me strongly caution you against use of BCC if you really don't want

I've to make a study about the use of international character sets in mail,
www, ... Some of the topics are :
- how do you create/read a message on a unix host that has another character
  set ?
- what telnet programs (dos/windows) allow to use 8bit character sets and how do they map the characters to their character sets ?
- what do www-client programs do (or don't do) with the display of characters
  above ASCII-128 on a dumb terminal, an x-term, ... ?

I'm looking for all possible info on this subject. I know where to find the
RFC's, so those references i don't need any more.

If anyone has implemented the use of ISO-LATIN-1 or another character set on
his site in email and other applications, i would be very interested in 
hearing how you did this, with which software, ...

Any info is welcome, thanks

Greetings,

You can remap the keyboard if you have a qwerty and want to use ISO Latin
1 characters. I had to do this on my Silicon Graphics to be able to write
in french, with accents etc. My mailer is Pine 3.89, executed in a xterm
window which is remapped from within the .Xdefaults file. When Pine detects
non US-ASCII fonts in the message you are writing, it changes the
Content-Type: header to the appropriate one (Content-Type: text/plain; 
charset="iso-8859-1" in my case).

> what telnet programs (dos/windows) allow to use 8bit character sets

I'm using winsock qvtnet, or wintel for windows without remapping the
keyboard, but it can be done exactly like you do it for X11/Unix based
programs.

There is a very good document written by a canadian, François Yergeau 
(yergeau@phy.ulaval.ca) about ISO Latin 1 Charset usage, and keyboard
mapping, but it's in french. Tell me if you're interested...

IMHO !

Cheer up...

I quite often am involved in short to medium term projects made up of a group
of people.  Most often I will receive email from the person in charge and
this message will be cc'ed to all the others involved.  I would like to be
able to do a similar function as the "TakeAddr"  function, but instead of
just adding the sender to the alias directory, I would like to create a group
containing all the addresses in the from:, to:  and cc: fields.  I would also
like to do this without having to add each individual as an individual 
alias -- I.e.  only the group is created and the group holds all the 
addressing information. This is different from the way groups are 
maintained now where each group member must be in the alias 
directory.  What you think? 

Thanks for all the great work!

 Is there or will there be a pine for macintosh? The other versions work 
really well, you're right, so why not a mac version?!? Inquring minds
want to know.

I don't think so.  The problem is that pine is inherently a command-line,
text-only terminal program, and wouldn't really work directly ported to
the Mac.

Of course, there is a Mac IMAP client, as the original poster mentioned:
Mailstrom.  Mailstrom is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu; NOT in the
Info-Mac archives, but in /imap/clients.  Of course, Sumex is nearly
impossible to get into these days...:(

Mailstrom is similar to Pine in some ways, but not in all.

But IMAP doesn't do that.  Who uses it as a simple POP replacement?  Is
anyone defining a POP-equivalent subnet?  IMAP Lite?  If you want to replace
your POP with functionally equivalent IMAP, you get to run the more complex
server and leave your server open to the kinds of server-resource-draining
behavior that IMAP was designed for.

IMAP is great.  But if you are aiming to limit your server resources
by offering only POP-style usage, then IMAP server and client software is
not ready for prime time.

I was about to cast by vote whole heartedly for IMAP over POP, but
John Wobus' comments above, remind me to add the caveat that IMAP
is better than POP as long as it makes sense for you to shift
resource usage onto the server, with the advantage of reducing 
load on the client and on the network bandwidth. 

These conditions fit for people like Bill Yeager who are interested
in mobile & disconnected use, and people who get hundreds of messages
a day and don't want to download them all to find the one they need, 
but there may be a number of cases where server load  is the more
important limiting factor. In that case, then yes - POP makes more 
sense.

Could you elaborate on what sort of ``server-resource-draining behavior'' you
are referring to?  Have you made any sort of statistical analysis about
various distributed email strategies and their relative costs?

I can understand the claim that keeping mail on the server consumes disk
space, but it would be much more expensive for me to buy adequate disk space
on every client that I use for mail than it would be to buy adequate disk
space on a single server.

It is interesting to compare IMAP vs NFS when you talk about resource
consumption.

Subject: HP "sent-mail is locked" ERROR
Date: 3 Aug 1994 04:44:44 GMT
Message-Id: <31n7cf$igo@condor.ic.net>


After I do a Control-X to send a letter, it freezes like that on my screen,
I'm not sure what I compiled wrong, but apparently I did. It does this 
countdown thing, sayes that it has 280 seconds before it unlocks it.
Every 5 seconds or so, it beeps. 

Here the situation I'm trying to setup:

On an HP9000/832 I have just UUCP mail feed to my home computer
which has a slip connection off the internet. I have my HP, uucico
into my home computer on an hourly basis.

I just started working there 3 months ago. 

Mail has been working fine as far as UUCP, but when I first started using
pine on the HP, I noticed it said it could not access sendmail in :
/usr/lib/sendmail. I noticed the permissions set 000. So it could not
be accessed. (Actually when it's like that everything works fine.)
So now I turn on sendmail with 777 permissions and use pine, and I
get that stupid 'Folder "sent-mail" is locked, Blah Blah.'

I don't know what to do. I love Pine and want to use it there.

Can someone help me?

Please!

Pine 3.90 will have the call to sendmail broken out into a separate
OS-dependent file, which would make is a bit more straight-forward to hack
in.

Hi all,

Don't you think Pine 3.89 is already a very good and cool mailer ? I really
prefer to wait for release 3.90 rather than having to pay for an equivalent
mailer with weekly releases !!! Great job has already been done within Pine
I'm convinced the next release will be very satisfying too... even if coming
a little bit late !

Has someone tried (beta) X11 version of Pine called Spruce ?

Cheers
GB

I'm very new to pine and to this list so maybe this has been discussed 
already...

When I try to put multiple lines on the feature-list= line of pine.conf 
only the first item is shown with pine -conf.  In other words:

feature-list=enable-tab-completion, 
	enable-jump-shortcut,
	signature-at-bottom,
	delete-skips-deleted,
	enable-alternate-editor-cmd

gives me the following when I say pine -conf :

feature-list=enable-tab-completion

If I put all the features on one line then pine -conf reports them all, but
in the multi-line format, which I can't use as a starting point for a 
new .pinerc. 

Has this been discussed before?

I'm running the following version of pine under Solaris 2.3:
last-version-used=3.89

Also, I sent a question in as my first posting to this list asking if 
anyone has modified pico's spell.c to allow for the use of ispell.  This 
would, I believe, entail running ispell on the temp file and then 
replacing the temp file rather than going into the word prompting command 
loop currently in pico's spell.c code.  I believe the PMDF pine version 
on VMS does this (only using DECspell and not ispell).  It shouldn't be 
very hard for someone who knows how to replace a pico edit buffer--but I 
was hoping for advice before I attempted it myself.  [This would probably 
answer the question posted recently about using a spanish dictionary as 
ispell has foreign language support, by the way.]

I for one agree.  Pine 3.89 doesn't do everything we would like but it
does a lot of good things relative to other programs out there.  For the
price and the fact that the majority of our end-users don't have a great
need for all of the highly technical bells and whistles, I have never been
one to complain.  IMHO, I would rather wait a "few more weeks" for a good,
solid release than get an early, buggy one with frequent patches and
updates.  We put up with that too much in the MS-DOS, Windows, Mac
environment now days. 

Just my $.02 worth.  Rick Nebel.

I can understand the issue about longer session times over dial-up
connections for IMAP, although I would contend that many users might keep
their dial-up session active throughout the time they are using their
email client, especially if they have their POP client (eg. Eudora)
configured to do immediate sends and they are replying to messages, one by
one, and if they are making a local call.

However, I don't really buy the issue of POP somehow relieving disk space
on the server. In either protocol, you must allocate some disk quota to
each user and implement some sort of space retrieval (or mail bouncing)
system so you can deal with accumulations of unread email. I would
contend, based on the pattern of use among students at our university,
that the bulk of the storage is consumed by unread mail, not mail that has
already been read. What I'm told is that students on average check email
less frequently than do staff, which allows a greater accumulation of
unread mail. We've heard horror stories for departmental email systems
where a student logs on, subscribes to eleventy seven LISTSERV lists, and
then doesn't logon again for a month.

If you set the quota so that it is not practical for students to store
their logs of email history on the server, but only to accomodate a
reasonable accumulation of inbox messages, I suspect there won't be a
whole lot of difference between IMAP and POP as far as server disk space
goes.

For me, the real reason to go IMAP is to resolve the problems of sharing a
single machine among many (e.g. public access workstation) and of sharing
a single inbox among many workstations (e.g. a workstation at home and a
workstation at work). Also, the advantages of shared inboxes, selective
downloads of MIME components, etc.

I am having trouble having Pine putting my .signature at the end of a

signature-at-bottom" in my .pinerc file, but that doesn't do it.  Is 
there something I'm forgetting to do?

Also I am using "vacation" to send an automatic reply to any mail I

file without actually typing it in?  Maybe a $ variable or something?  
TIA for any info.

Check for the existence of "filter" or "procmail"  Filter is easy to
use, but procmail is pretty powerful.

Greetings.

I'm trying to figure out how to reply to an e-mail with a form letter.  
For example, I placed a post in some newsgroups that led to a large 
response, but I want to be able to reply to everyone with the same letter.

I've been writing down the respondee's name, and forwarding the form 
letter to them, but that seems like a waste of time, and the inbox 
doesn't mark the respondee's note with and "A" to note that it's been 
answered.

Is there any way to reply with a form letter?

PLEASE RESPOND VIA E-MAIL...  THANKS!

Who would want to? All I'm saying is that IMAP contains the functionality
of POP - obviously it isn't POP. But a MUA could be written that uses IMAP
in _exactly_ the same way that POP is used. No-one has done that because
IMAP also allows you to do other things too. 

: your POP with functionally equivalent IMAP, you get to run the more complex

I'm a bit concerned about your "server-resource-draining" comment - it may
scare off potential users ;-) IMAP _can_ use more resources than POP
because it offers more features - but I wouldn't want people to think it's
some kind of memory-hog...

Try setting signature-file=<filename> in your .pinerc. That does the 
trick for me.

For your .vacation.msg, it is simply text. Just enter into any editor and 
insert the file where you want it placed. For example, if you use pico, 
open it with your .signature, place the cursor where you want the 
signature, and do CTRL-R. Type in the filename. No typing of file and 
signature is included.
Hope this helps.

	Simple....  pick up a "filter" program such as procmail or deliver
or filter (from the elm distribution).

	The most comprehesive (IMHO) is procmail.....from the FAQ:

A recent version can be picked up at various comp.sources.misc archives.
The latest version can be obtained directly from the ftp-archive at:

        ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (137.226.112.172)

I am curious what you posted that got such a response, but non the less, 
why don't you just respond, without including the previous message, and 
import the form letter, (Read File, ^R in pine).  There may be more 
automatic ways of doing this, but this will work.

Is this true and if so, could someone suggest an FTP site for a pine archive (preferably

Mailstrom V2, with MIME support and many other niceties, is still in
private alpha testing.  It's going slowly because the author and the other
people working on it all have full-time jobs at the moment which have
nothing to do with Mailstrom. :(  But they're trying to have it at least
in beta testing by sometime this fall.

As far as I know, no one has done a port yet.  I have been working with
Pine 3.89 but I'm having major problems with Pico & EMX/GCC's termcap
libraries (thus, I'm still working on Pico, haven't even starting porting
the rest of Pine itself yet).  I may switch to Borland and use the 
DOS-specific code, but then I have to actually be at my machine :-( 
instead of telnetting in (thank you IBM, for including a telnetd!). 

Pine 3.90 is supposed to use IMAP 3.4, which includes WINSOCK support and
other API (function params, etc) changes, so I'm inclined to wait for it
before porting the whole thing, given that it's due out "any day now" :-)
I'm continuing w/3.89 slowly though, I figure I will at least get used to
the code that way. 

I realize IBM TCP's socket interface has more in common w/BSD than
WINSOCK, but the Winsock code (other than winsock calls) is likely more
OS2 friendly than the BSD/Unix code, even using EMX/GCC.

Unfortunately I am having a problem printing some E-Mail 
using Pine.  I am using Pine ver 3.89 and the printer 
prints out short memos with no problems.  But when I try
to print out a memo of 48,958 or 49,039 I get a ProComm
error message saying "Procomm Error / Error printing to
printer".

I am an experienced PC user with some knowledge of Windows
(meaning I don't need to be spoon fed just yet ;)

I have the same problem in Pine with certain printers printing multiple
page messages using the DOS version of Procomm (but not with all 
printers.)
The solution I found was to capture printer output to a disc file while
on-line and then use the DOS 'print' command to print the file off-line. I
use the PRNDSK.COM program written by David Rifkind. 

My guess is that there's a handshaking problem between the computer and
the printer which may be easier to work around than to try to fix, but
I would be very interested in an easier solution.

It seems that everytime I delete mail, then quit pine, my xbiff fires,
telling me that new mail has arrived. How do I fix this?

Or better yet, what are your creative ways of running pine under X
such that it lets you know when new mail has arrived?

Hi!  :)

I guess this has probably been asked a zillion times, but since I've only 
recently gotten a hold of the newsgroup, I think I'm gonna risk getting 
flamed just to ask this question... *cringe*

Is it possible to read the path by which the mail arrived?  ie. the 
domain!domain!subdomain.domain!... etc.  Is it something that can be done 
by tweaking the .pinerc file?  or even in Pine itself?  :)

Cheers,
Ed

*FILTER* is easy to use?  Cosmos I hate UNIX and this whole ugly little

You might also want to edit the files ttyin.c, ttyout.c in the pine
directory.  It is somewhat unfortunate that the name "termname"
is used as a variable (char []), since in libcurse, termname() happens
to be a function.

I sent in a suggestion to the pine people last year about changing
termname the variable to something like "termName" so there won't be
a name conflict.  This was with regard to 3.89 so the changes, if any,
won't be there till next release of pine.

You can just do a search and replace all references to "termname" to
something else.  I suggest using "termName".

Hi All,

One of the many great features of Pine is its attached-to-ansi
print option.  Unfortunately this doesn't work with some
communication software, for example it doesn't work in either
MS Windows Terminal and Delrina's WinComm.  But it does work with 
DOS Kermit.  I'd like to compile a list of comm software that
it does and doesn't work with that I can give to my students
(I teach Internet classes).  It would be great if people could
either send me email or post a followup to this article saying
what comm software that you know it does or doesn't work with.

I'll post the list.

Thanks much,
Nancy

When PC Eudora sends out mail that contains 8bit characters and one
has turned off the Quoted-Printable option, the mail is encoded as
being "binary" (not "8bit"). I'm not sure what the MIME specs say
about this, but I can't change Eudora. 

This works fine between Eudoras but when replying to such a mail in
UNIX Pine 3.89 only the first line of the included text is prefixed.
When the mail is marked as being "8bit" replying works fine tough.

Bug or feature?

Can anyone of the Pine gurus point me to the piece of Pine-code that
decides what way to go?  I need to patch this if possible as it is a
problem for our internal mail.

Message-Id: <31r7u0$c4b@apollo.it.luc.edu>

I'm trying to run Pine on a VMS/VAX machine, and am having a bit of 
trouble trying to get it setup properly.  In particular:

1) How can I get it to automatically send myself a copy of message I send 
out.  I tried to setup the .pinerc file so that fcc would save a copy to 
a folder, but have not had any success yet.  While I could just specify 
my own address in the CC: field every time a send a message, there must 
be an easier way.

2) When I start pine it tries to open the INBOX folder, which has no 
messages, becasue new messages on our system show up in a NEWMAIL 
folder.  What I'd like to do is either: a) get pine to start up looking 
in the newmail folder (I'd prefer this); of b) get my new mail to appear 
in the INBOX folder.

3) Is there, or is there not, a Pine FAQ?

I think part of my troubles are due to the fact that I'm running Pine on 
a VMS/VAX system, and the setup is designed with something else in mind 
(Unix, PC?).

Any help would be appreciated.
jon.

What astounding eloquence & articulation.

The problem with most tools on most computer systems is that the more 
flexible they are the more detail is required to specify how you want 
them to behave.

To take a simple example from my .procmailrc (the file procmail uses to 
determine what to do with my incoming mail:

MAILDIR=$HOME/mail

#
# AMANDA mail reports
#

:0:
*^Subject:.*AMANDA MAIL REPORT FOR
amanda-mail

This could have been invented by changing a few of the words in the 
manual page / cookbook that came with procmail and *not* required an 
understanding of the regular expression notation.

Tells procmail to put mail with a Subject line containing AMANDA MAIL 
REPORT FOR in a folder called amanda-mail.

The reason Pine and Elm don't shuffle mail between mail boxes when it 
arrives is because their function is *not* delivery of inbound mail, a 
progran which was responsible for sending & receiving mail would be even 
more complex.  I suppose that it would be possible to have features that 
automatically shuffled mail aboutr thwn pine started up and every time 
new mail arrived, but that seems like a lot of work, and even if it were 
to be implemented as you suggest people would eventually ask for features 
like pattern matching and case insensitivity and the .pinerc would start 
looking like a little language for describing regular expressions again.  

One possible way round this would be to have the user shuffle mail 
manually for a bit and stick a simple bit of neural network code into 
pine so that once it recognised some patterns of use it could 
automatically start prompting the user...  There's probably time to get 
that in to 3.90 still ;-)

> I long for the day when this whole paradigm of user interface is a detestable

If you abandon using computers today then you're in luck ;-) The paradigm
of "user interface" is pretty useful to people trying to use computers. 
Even if someone develops a really neat buzzword-laden GUI driven object
oriented interface there'll be someone who says "Just how many *******
buttons do I have to press to specify..." 

Rant off.

Thanks to the Pine Team for pine which is still fairly simple despite the 
number of features grafted on to it.

I am new to PINE and I have some questions if someone can help me.

1. whenever I reply (mail) from within PINE it gives me a message that 
'permision denied'. The mail however does get to where it was sent.

2. How can I save a letter?

3. How can I have pine automaticaly save the FROM in eache letter? It 
would be nice if it only saved the new ones, namely only uniqe ones.

any help would be apreciated.
thanks

Message-Id: <31s5fa$ami@ctsc.hkbc.hk>

I have heard of Pine ver. 3.90 can support multiple addressbook so that
I can convert my system aliases into a global addressbook that everyone
can use it. When will Pine ver. 3.90 release ? Cause I am using verion
3.89 and find it did not support system aliases in sendmail.

Is that version support the common brand of UNIX OS such as SUN OS,
Solaris, HPUX and IBM AIX?

Your kind discussion is much appreciated.

other than Pine, does anyone have any recommendations regarding other IMAP

Does anyone have experience running ECSmail or AIRmail (DOS/Windows based)?

It works in under OS/2 using IBM's TCP/IP for OS/2 telnet capabilities
(provided you have updated to the latest corrective service diskettes -
readily available).  I do this using both a token ring network connection
and SLIP from home.

I agree this is a wonderfully liberating feature.
Please post a summary.  Thanks.

I am the author of Spruce.

Unfortunately I have been so busy with my work since May that I haven't
had any time to finish Spruce up to distribution quality yet. 
The summer has also been so nice that I've spent all my spare time 
outdoors. When the autumn rains begin, that's when it's good time to start
writing code again. Hope that doesn't come too soon :-)

I have also been waiting for PINE 3.90 release, and hoping to upgrade
Spruce to same level at once.

Those who are interesed and have a decent WWW client can take a look
at some documentation I started in May at:

http://dshp02.trs.ntc.nokia.com:3000/Spruce/Spruce.html

Especially interesting should be the interface description with screen
captures at:
http://dshp02.trs.ntc.nokia.com:3000/Spruce/interface.html

One can also download an uuencoded demo executable for HP9000/7xx.
The WWW server is located in Finland (see /~leiman/Finland.html)
so the network connection may s l o w from somewhere like Seattle,
or even down sometimes.

The source code of Spruce is at an ugly messy state and I ought to 
clean the source directory up before I dare to show that stuff publicly.

This is an idea I have been thing for some time:
================================================
As soon as I find time, I'll start a major cleanup at Spruce source
directory and put it all publicly available through HTML hypertext
links. The HTML would also document the code a bit, making it reasonably 
easy to see the structure of the code. How does this sound?

I also have to figure out how to configure my httpd (WWW server) to
act as an ftp proxy, so that I could distribute source code and
compiled binaries from my own host. The biggest problem here is to
assure system security against hacker penetration.

I have been contacted by many people who have expressed a keen interest 
in porting the Spruce code for various platforms. Perhaps this way
also compiled binaries can be provided.

Currently I have very little time to read news, so I may not read this
newsgroup too often.

Just leave Pine running in an xterm window, and shrink it down
to about 8 lines. Pine will notify you of new mail, plus you 
will have a display of the last couple of messages so you 
don't have to do anything else to check to make a good guess 
it it's urgent or junk mail. ( The "+" in the display is 
always a good clue! )

Hello,

Our system has 2 domain names. Sendmail uses aliases to handle incomming 
mail sent to either domain.

I am trying to configure it so some users appear as user1@domain1.com
others as user2@domain2.com. I don't know sendmail well enough to do it 
thru sendmail.cf.

I was wondering if there is a way to set it in .pinerc. I tried setting
user-domain but that didn't seem to work. 

Please respond via email if possible.

Thanks in advance,

I was going through the "checklist of some things to check when testing a 
new port" in the Pine Technical Notes.  I ported Pine to VM/CMS...  Just 
kidding! = )

I was testing Pine 3.89 on Solaris.  The "#" command on main menu with
debug level 9 resulted in the following:

Bug in Pine detected: "Testing panic".
Exiting pine.
Abort

What does this all mean?

Another item in the checklist is "Pinef."  Pine what?

Thanks!

Message-Id: <31o76o$5dr@news.cs.tulane.edu>

Hi,

	I've seen it on this newsgroup, but, unfortunately, I ignored it.
When I start up Pine, it tells me that it is a read-only session.  Normally,
it is because there is another session of PINE running (I already know that)
whether suspended or on another UNIX session.  However,  this happened after
I logged out.  In other words, I have no open UNIX sessions on the 
network (I checked several times) and I have no current jobs running in the
background.  What's up with this??

	BTW, HELP, my mail is piling up, and I can't delete!! :)

I would like to send mail from my home computer with the from: field
intact, while adding a Reply to: field so that I can get a reply at

the .pinerc file myself... but I still havn't figured out how to do it...
if someone can help, please e-mail me... thanks!

We have pine binaries on ftp.celestial.com that work with smail-3.1.28
(drop-in replacement for sendmail).  I've been told that they should
work with mmdf, but since I don't do mmdf here or at any of my client
sites I can't verify that.

Just set up an alias like:

 alias pico 'pico -z'

Simple enough. And of course, as always, RTFM!!

Include this in your .pinerc file:

Dunno about the FAQ, but the answer of both of your questions are in the 
man pages & online help. Hack around.

I can't find a reason why it could, but again, I cannot find a reason why 
it couldn't.

You may have changed the access to critical files and/or directories. If 
you don't know what I'm talking about, seek help from the sysadms at your 
site. They can fix it for you as well.

Until then, I have a c-shell script (inspired by mkpgp) you can use as an 
interface to pgp.

In a compose window you:
 
            use the editor of your choice,
            send encrypted attachments (as .tar.Z.uu in the message text, 
            encrypt a message,
            sign a message.
            
In a reply/forward you:
 
	    use the editor of your choice,
            decrypt, 
            extract encrypted attachments from the message text, 
            check signatures, 
            add public keys.
 
 
You can get it by  (1) sending your pgp public key to 
deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu with (2) a promise not to 
laugh out loud at the code.

Date: 6 Aug 1994 11:27:56 +0930
Message-Id: <31uqn4$l5e@eve.adam.com.au>


Could anyone tell me if it is possible to redefine keys in pine, so that 
the <up> <down> <lef> & <right> cursor keys can be used to navigate 
through folders and indexes in a similar way to tin ?

Many thanks,

Neil.

I am trying to port pine to a 3B2.  Has anyone been successful?
Is there a port available that would save me a lot of work.
My 3B2 is running ATT System V V3.

Jim,
	There are a number of places where you can obtain vacation, 
mostly depending on what system you are running, for each is a bit 
different. I will give you two sites. First, ftp to unix.hensa.ac.uk or 
you can check plaza.aarnet.edu.au . Good luck. Hope this helps

Steve

   You save a mail your received in a folder of your choice using
   the "S" command (that's the above reply)
   You save OUTGOING mail you send in a folder of your choice by :

      moving the cursor to the header of the mail being composed
      pressing control-R to get a Rich header
      filling the Fcc: field (Folder-Carbon-Copy)

     I'll try to guess what the original poster asked.

     either the second of my replies to question 2 (save outgoing mail)

     or a way of saving incoming mail by folders according to the
     mail sender. I do not know a way of doing this automatically
     (like NOTEBOOK with VM Rice Mail), I know a feature called 
     "elm-style-save" exists in .pinerc but I've never used.

     of a way of saving the addresses of the senders in the addressbook
     which can be done using the T ("Take Address") command

In addition to Mailstrom and ECSmail...

Another possibility is Mail Drop by Carl Bell at Baylor University.
See /pub/bell/Mail_Drop on ackmo.baylor.edu

The development version dated 8/4/94 appears to have the beginnings of MIME 
support.

Subject: Any readers sort incoming by username?
Message-Id: <Cu5FD6.LBs@rahul.net>
Date: Sun, 7 Aug 1994 05:03:06 GMT


Are there any mail readers that can sort the incoming mail by username?  
Lets say my wife and I share an account, and we have wildcard forwarding 
so all mail comes in regardless if the username is typed correctly or 
not.  I want incoming mail to user 'abc' to go to folder A and incoming 
mail to user 'def' to go to folder B, automatically.  Then when I logon I 
would not look at the incoming mail like I do now, but rather just go 
right to folder A, and the wife would go straight to folder B.

Which mail readers do this, and which is best?  Thanks,

Kevin

It sounds like it is the _file_ "sent-mail" within the "mail" 
subdirectory in your home directory that is causing the problem, and not
"sendmail" in /usr/lib.  The problem could be improper permissions on the
home directory (or any parent directory), the mail subdirectory, or the
actual sent-mail file. It could also be caused by NFS file locking if you
are mounting your home directory.  The NFS file locking problem is fixed
by several patches.

This isn't really the job of the mail reader, but of a Mail Delivery
Agent (MDA) like Chip Salzenberg's deliver program which can put
incoming mail into different mailboxes based on any selection criteria
you specify.  For instance, with deliver I put something in my
$HOME/.forward file like:

"|/usr/lib/mail/deliver bill"

My MTA (Mail Transport Agent) sees this and pipes the mail message to
the deliver program (WITH USER-ID SET TO bill which eliminates many
potential security problems).  Deliver looks for a $HOME/.deliver
program which is any executable program (I use perl scripts) and
executes that program looking at its standard output to determine what
to do with the mail message.  It the simplest form a shell script
could do several things:

user=$1     # this saves user name which is first argument

echo $user  # this would tell deliver to put it in my system inbox.
print "$user:$HOME/Mail/inbox1";    # save in specified mailbox.
echo DROP   # send to /dev/null -- it's probably junk.
exit 0;

Deliver splits the mail into separate $HEADER and $BODY files and sets
various environment variables like $SENDER (originator of the message)
which make it easy for the user to do things without having to parse
the mail message.  For instance, if I want to send all mail that
originates from president@whitehouse.gov where it belongs using a
shell script it might be:

case "$SENDER" in   #{
    president@whitehouse.gov: echo DROP;;
    *) echo $1;;
esac    #}

Other programs like Elm's filter do much the same thing.  I like
deliver because I don't have to learn a new language, but can use
whatever is most comfortable for me.

Question:  Is there a command-line switch on Pine which tells Pine to NOT 
go into interactive mode, ie. to return you immediately to the Unix 
prompt when the INBOX is empty?   I've read the man but can't locate 
such an option.   Sure would save me a bit of time cycling thru the 
program (and reassuring it 'yes, I REALLY REALLY want to leave Pine').

Thank you for the suggestions. We have the filter program on our system 
and since this is also the easier one to use I gave it a try. Only one 
problem, ... when I put the line 

| /usr/local/bin/filter -o~/.elm/clp.filter_errors

in my .forward file all my mail goes no where. It gets returend to the 
sender.

Any ide why?

Hi, there. Whoever has installed Procmail before, can you help me?
I'm having a hard time installing it, and it asked for a lot of stuffs
which I'm not too familiar since I'm a new UNIX user.

I think I have kind of installed it (minus a few directories here and 
there), but how on earth do you use it with PINE?

Thanks for any kind souls' help.

I used this potion to set the mail directory to ~/Mail in the global pine
configuration for our system (same used by ELM so people can go back and
forth).

But since this change I've noticed that when a new user cranks up pine for
the first time, it dies on them because it cant find a ~/Mail folder.  I
assume its hard coded into pine to create a ~/mail on start up, but since
for new users there is no ~/Mail, it dies?

Can this be fixed in future versions, so that it reads the variable in the
config file first and create that directory if it doesnt exist?  I assume
there is a hack I can make to the code to tell pine to create and look for
~/Mail instead of ~/mail?

OK, this is more a question about Pico:

I have a Mac LC, with a standard keyboard.  When i try to use the 
"control ^" feature, to mark text for cutting, i end up typing "6".  I can 
use "^K", "^Y", "^X", and many others; however, i still haven't figured out 
why this "^^" does not work.

Anyone has experienced the same?

Thanks

Exact same problem from both my IIsi and my old SE.  I posted the
problems a few months back and got some suggestions for workarounds (I
think involving <esc> <esc> or something--I'd have to check my notes)
but it didn't work.  Very frustrating.

It seems like the current release is somewhat partial to Suns cc compiler.

It sounds like you are using NCSA Telnet 2.6.  Versions 2.5 doesn't have 
this problem.

Telnet 2.5 used to fiddle with the KCHR resource which maps the keyboard 
into the characters that actually get sent down the line to the host.  
This apparently caused various problems, so in version 2.6 they always 
honour the KCHR selected in the System.

Unfortunately this means that Ctrl/^ now appears as "6".  Sigh.

One workaround is to type Ctrl/Shift/6 (which if you look at the keyboard 
really IS Ctrl/^ ... Ctrl/6 without Shift could be argued to be just 
that: Ctrl/6!).  This works fine.

Alternatively you can try using one of the alternative KCHR files that 
are shipped with Telnet 2.6.  One of these is called "U.S. - Fixed 
Controls".  Drag this onto your System Folder icon (it will be placed in 
the System file).  Then use the Keyboard control panel to select it.  
With luck things should now work.

As an aside, I found that doing this helps me with my British keyboard.  
The keystroke Shift/3 used to generate the hash (tic-tac-toe) sign in 
Telnet 2.5, but in 2.6 generates the (curly-L) pound sign actually 
printed on the key top.  Unfortunately UNIX doesn't like this!  Using the 
US KCHR resource fixes this too.

A useful thing to know is that Command-Option-Space cycles around the 
KCHRs you have installed in your System (ie, those visible in the list in 
the Keyboard control panel).

Hi,

I very much liked the prune or folder update command of Elm.
It deleted marked messages and reread the incoming MBOX folder.
Is there any way of doing this under pine also? (except quitting
and restarting of course ;)

Subject: Need PGP Script for Unix Pine 3.89
Date: 8 Aug 1994 06:15:07 GMT
Message-Id: <324ihb$lan@rigel.infinet.com>

Hey guys,

I'm looking for a working Pretty Good Privacy 2.6 Script to interface with
Unix Pine 3.89.  From what I've seen it can be invoked by script when the
.pinerc alt.editor configuration is used from the old-growth setup.  Do
any of you have a working script that works that way?  If you do, would
you be willing to share it? Any help in this area appreciated. 

I have already written to Philip Zimmerman of PGP, and to David L Miller 
of UW, coauthor of PINE to no avail.  I guess they don't need any legal 
problems by officially sanctioning the use of PGP with its intergration 
into PGP, I can understand. But I am sure, that there is someone more 
adept than myself, who likes a challenge, doesn't mind that Big Brother 
is watching, and would be glad to encourage others to get some privacy 
without major hassles interfacing software.

DMH

   There are two directories you have to change (in the .pinerc file) 
"folder-collections" and "mail-directory".  The mail-directory is where 
postponed and interrupted messages are held.  If you change both of these 
to "Mail", then pine shouldn't create the "~/mail" directory.

You may have no "jobs" running in background but there may well
be a pine process running in background.  I don't know what type
of unix you're on so either `ps -ux` or `ps -fu <user>` should
show _all_ of your processes including those not tied to a tty.

If there is a stray pine process then kill it with `kill -9 <pid>`
If not, then something's gone wrong somewhere and you'll have to
delete the lock file.

This should be called something like:	/tmp/.\var\mail\user
or:					/tmp/.\usr\spool\mail\user

Delete that file and your INBOX should become writeable again.

Hope that works/helps,


	Liam.

This is the variable to change, just make sure you change it properly.

>I used this potion to set the mail directory to ~/Mail in the global pine

Nope.  This isn't quite right.  If you watch carefully when pine tries to
create you directory (and also read the .pine-debug* files) you can tell
what is going on.  You should change this to *just* "Mail".  No "~/" in
front of it.

>the first time, it dies on them because it cant find a ~/Mail folder.  I

Yes, it does die if you set the mail-directory to ~/Mail.  It does not die
when you set it to Mail.  I don't know why but I guess the code is for
it to work in your homedirectory always.  A good hint is if you were to
set the mail-directory to your *full* path (/users/cs/pthirose/Mail in my
case) then when pine tries to create a directory, it tries to create
/users/cs/pthirose/users/cs/pthirose/Mail.  The first part is by default
(I'm guessing) and the "repeated part" is because of what I set my
mail-directory variable to.

>Can this be fixed in future versions, so that it reads the variable in the

Bottom line - it doesn't need to be fixed (although it should, or at least
made better documented.)  What you oguht to try is changing the mail-directory
to just Mail instead of ~/Mail.  To me, I think it's silly and both should
work, but hey.

Hope this helps....

I can't have a remote folder collection be the "default for saves" and then 
have the "default fcc" be a folder in the local folder collection in 
3.89, as far as I can tell.  Pine 3.90 will fix this, right?  And it will 
also make me handsome and rich, right?

Thanks!

Pine seems to have a bug when saving to boxes other than the default.  I
for instance use ~.elm/Mail since I used to use elm and still do for some 
things and the format is compatible but pine keeps trying to put in ~/"boxname"
instead of ~/.elm/Mail/"boxname".  If I save to the default it places the
mail in the correct ~/.elm/Mail/"boxname" file.
Is this a known limitation? Feature? ...

Thanks.

When I send mail using pine on SCO Rel 3.2 Ver 4.2 it sends the wrong date.
The date is always February 23, 1970.

On another system running SCO Unix Rel 3.2 Ver 2.0 pine aborts when trying
to start it up. 

Anyone experienced these problems before?

I have had pine running on a different system with SCO ODT 3.0
(same as SCO Unix 3.2 Ver 4.2) for months and it works just fine.
The ones with the date problem are all fresh installs on new
machines.

Message-Id: <326cj8$kiv@chopin.udel.edu>

I've been using pine for a few years now, but I've recently gotten an
account on a machine where pine is not installed.  I've spoken with the
system manager but I don't think I can talk him into installing pine. 

I'm interested in installing pine in my own account if it's not too
awfully large (pico is already available on the system).  The machine is
running SunOS Release 4.1.3.

I'm fairly new to UNIX and don't know exactly what I need to do to install
Pine in my account.  I've found the source code and binaries using Gopher
but don't know exactly which files I need, how to install them, etc.  I'd
greatly appreciate it if someone would be willing to walk me through this
installation, or at least point me in the right direction.

Thanks muchly--

The best mail program to use filters is definitely MH. I use it to
filter mail from different people to different folders and to delete
mail that is junk. If you would like an example script to do this in MH
you can post to this newsgroup and I will post it.

Once upon a time, you were reading mail with pine, and some form of crash 
occured, meaning that your system mail folder was left LOCKED. Next 
time(s) you invoked pine, it saw the file was locked - and therefore 
opened it read-only. The fact that this locked-file problem is ongoing 
implies to me that the files is physically locked via the .lock file 
extension.

Check for /usr/spool/mail/jsallen.lock or /usr/mail/jsallen.lock 
(assuming your usercode is jsallen). Ensure you're not using mail at that 
point in time, and then delete it (it will be a zero-length file).

You really should have just asked your System Admin/Postmaster - she could 
have probably helped you quicker than we have...

I was viewing my sent-mail file and I wanted to sort the file by the TO: 
field which seemed like a natural thing to want to do for a file 
containing the mail I have sent out. Unfortunately, what I found is that 
you can sort on the From field (pretty useless given that by definition 
all of the mail in this folder came from me). Is there any other easy way  
to do what I want from within Pine?

I keep a few distribution lists, and sometimes people email me asking

only allows adding to the address list. How can I take an address

Unless you must access your mailbox via IMAP you can apply the Unix
file test operator for that matter:

alias pine "[ -s $MAIL ] && \pine"

assuming MAIL would hold the pathname to your mailbox.

Assuming you are on a SPARC-based machine, all you should need is the pine
binary for SunOS.  Download it, call it "pine", mark it executable (chmod +x
pine), and you should be ready to go...

Subject: Pine 3.89 setup for SCO
Date: 9 Aug 1994 16:54:33 GMT
Message-Id: <328cc9$4b@herald.indirect.com>

I have FTPd the pine 3.89 binary for SCO UNIX from 
soils.agron.iastate.edu and would like to know if this program works with 
MMDF.  I have installed the program and I get sporatic mail delivery on 
the  system.  What I am doing is using UUCP to poll mail from Netcom and 
then MMDF to deliver it, then for now use pine to read the mail.  I plan 
to get SMTP gateway running and have MMDF deliver mail there for the 
people using PCs and pine for those who use terminals.  But this problem 
is persistant.
I sent a message to a friend in the office as a test message. he never 
got it.  He in return sent one back to me and the same.  But when I send 
messages to root (Superuser) it gets there.
The address lines are as follows.

from davida to
davidp@datacal.datacal.com    ---no delivery
davidp@datacal.com            ---no delivery
root@datacal.com              ---delivery
root@datacal.datacal.com      ---delivery

from root to
davida@datacal.com            ---delivery
davidp@datacal.com            ---no delivery

Any ideas?????????????

Can someone please tell me whether the PC Pine support MIME?
If the answer is yes, is there any command line args. which allow me to
specify a file as an attachment ie. I just want to use PINE to send out an
attachment without starting it up.

Message-Id: <Thacker-0908941956120001@ppp5.dialup.unt.edu>

Having tested ECS Mail version 3 and being fairly impressed with IMSP, I
wonder if Pine will eventually support the IMSP standard.

IMSP stands for Internet Messaging Support Protocal (I think) and allows a
mail package to store it's configuration information on some remote
machine.  This means that whenever I fire up a mail/IMSP client from
anywhere in the world, as long as it is pointed to the proper IMSP server,
all of my personal setup information (folder configuration, message
services to connect to, what windows were open, what viewers to use
etc....) are all downloaded and interpreted for the client that I am on.

I remember reading somewhere that Pine might support the IMSP standard one
day, but am curious about how soon that might be.  The ISA Corp will have
it ready in ECS Mail version 3 when it ships in the next month or so.

Thanks again!

Subject: Pine 3.89 on an NCR 3550 (SVR4 without sendmail)?
Date: 9 Aug 1994 22:08:39 -0400
Message-Id: <329cr7$n57@news.Wittenberg.EDU>

Anyone have any luck getting Pine to work on an NCR 3550 or similar AT&T
SVR4 system that dosen't have sendmail on it?  It compiles and works mostly
OK, it reads mail OK, but chokes on sending mail.

There's actually two problems here: 
1) I don't know exactly what to have Pine call as its MTA, since sendmail
isn't on here.  Should I be calling rmail?  mailx?  With what args?

2) It also gives some weird errors before even getting that far. Things like
"folder 'sent-mail' dosen't exist, create?'" when it does in fact exist....
if I say "y", it says it can't create it because it exists already....
if I say "n", I get an error saying "fcc of message rejected".  (Whatever
that means....  probably a failure to run the MTA right?)

I do have write permission on ~/mail and ~/mail/send-mail, too.  First thing
I checked.

Anyway, has anyone gotten this to fly and want to save me a little hassle? :)

By the way, we have applied the patch from NCR to the mail system that keeps it
from rewriting everything into stupid bang adddresses, if that helps.

Thanks much,

Mike Andrews, Wittenberg University

I receive a digested mailing list and sometimes it would be nice to 
respond directly to the author of a piece rather than to the full mailing 
list. Is there a way in Pine to do that? If it's in the help, I can't 
find it.

If not, any ideas on how to accomplish the same thing other than writing 
a note.

I have discovered that the ctrl-J method of attaching a file doesn't work.
I'm not sure when it stopped (I'm not a PINE user myself but support several),
with the upgrade or before (or after) but it doesn't work with either OS.
Specifying the attachment in the header is fine.   Any ideas?

What you need is another machine on your network that has sendmail or
can in another way serve as an smtp server. Then you just enter that
machine in your .pinerc file as "smtp-server=<machine name or address>".

You could also fiddle with the source to enter the correct call to your
smtp mailing program. We had to correct the path to sendmail after it
was finally installed. I wish this was a configurable parameter in
.pinerc or at least a compile-time switch.

Hope that helps,

Can someone explain how filter works with Pine?  I have looked at 'man 
pine', at 'man filter', and at .pinerc and I just don't understand it.  I 
would like to sort my incoming mail based either on who it is from, or 
who it is to (lets say that the 'to' part can vary, because I have wild 
card forwarding on so all mail gets through regardless of the spelling, 
etc).  Can I sort both ways?  Could someone give an example?  I have 
tried it, and when I hit enter to go to the new folder, I get a messages 
that the conection failed.  Why is it trying to make a conection?  

Any help is appreciated!

thanks,

   I am not aware of a way in Pine.
   But you can write a shell script around it (we have one which
   tests if inbox is empty : if not empty enters pine in the inbox
   index, if empty enters pine folder list.

We get the size of inbox as (csh script) :

set dim = `ls -s /var/spool/mail/$USER`

(actualy we do an rsh in some cases according to where user's inbox
reside, but that's our local arrangement)

if ($#dim == 0) then
  set dim1 = 0
else
  set dim1 = $dim[1]
endif

After this massaging dim1 will contain 0 if inbox empty or not
existing, non-zero otherwise

Does PC-pine offer support for offline-mailreading over modem without using
slip/ppp? I remember reading that IMAP supports it, but is it incorporated
in PC-pine or will it eventually be?

I think Eudora (at least the commercial version) offers this support, but
I have never heard about it in Pine yet.

Thanks in advance.

Below is a note from a Macintosh Eudora user at our site who I'm trying 
to get interested in Pine.

I'd be grateful if anyone could provide an explanation of what's causing
the problem and what can be done in situations of this type.

--------------

I had a 'peculiarity' with Eudora (for Macintosh) and PINE this morning.

I have been away on holiday and wanted to use PINE to quickly delete all
'bounces' from MAIL LISTs that I own. When my machine started up, Eudora
was launched as a 'startup' application and began to transfer my unread
MAIL from our main Unix server (around 1300 messages!). I aborted this
transfer with <CMD> period and 'Quit' Eudora. I then left things for a
meeting (two hours) and on returning launched Telnet on the Mac to begn a
Unix session, then ran PINE.

PINE only showed 12 messages in my IN box.

When I reloaded Eudora it still showed around 1300 messages to be transferred.

I then went back to PINE and it showed ZERO messages in my IN box.

Is there some flag that Eudora sets in the mailer on Unix that PINE is
interpreting to indicate that all MAIL has been read and deleted up to that
point?

Eudora uses POP, not IMAP.  The abort of Eudora may have left the
messages in an intermediate file POP uses, typically
/var/spool/mail/.userid.pop (userid being the user's actual id).
If so, they were really gone from "INBOX" and IMAP was reporting the
situation correctly.  Once Eudora starts, probably best to let it
finish what it's doing.

Eudora uses the POP protocol and when it downloads mail it first 
moves all mail from the users mailbox 
(usually /usr/spool/mail/<username> - making the mailbox empty) 
to a "POP" file (usually /usr/spool/mail/.<username>.pop).  If a user in 
the middle of a Eudra download aborts, the mail stays in the "pop" file. 

When the same user logs on to their account after the "abort" and tries
pine, pine looks in the mailbox (/usr/spool/mail/<username>). pine would
only find "new" mail that came in since the download was attempted.  It
wouldn't find the "old" mail because it is now in a different file.  You
can either copy this "pop" file back to the mailbox file, or you can use
pine and when you "GoToFolder" type the full name of the "pop" file
(/usr/spool/mail/.<username>.pop).

How do you keep your screen from junking up in pine 3.89 when printing?  


Every time I print it also displays the message or send s the output to the 
screen also.  This junks up the scrween and if you want to print other letters
it looks kind of goofy. 

Also is there a way to mark mail to print.  Example mark a few messages to
print instead of having to print them individually?

Pine will support IMSP, but a specific schedule has not been set for
implementation.  Is ISA going to distribute/support an IMSP server, or are
they relying on the server from CMU (currently in _alpha_ test)?

Pine currently treats the digest parts as text rather than messages, so no,
you cannot respond directly.  We plan to improve handling of embedded
messages in a future release or Pine...

I've been reading replys like this for a while, and I'm curious: what
ISN'T going to be in 3.90?  It seems to me that this is a MAJOR
change, if all these new things are going to be in it, so it puzzles
me as to why it isn't going to be Pine 4.00 or something. (not that it
really MATTERS to me...I mean, our systems here are still using Emacs
18.59, so I don't expect us to upgrade Pine for a couple years....)

Subject: Stop deletion of sent-mail
Date: 10 Aug 1994 17:46:41 GMT
Message-Id: <32b3q2$rc0@news.midland.co.nz>

I was wondering if there is a way to stop pine trying to delete all my 
old sent-mail-* boxes at the start of every month?? This is very anoying 
as I want to keep them, I have gone through the man page and the pinerc 
but I don't see any obvious option that turns this off ( No doubt it's 
right in front of my eyes though ). If there is no proper way will 
commenting out the "last prune date" or whatever near the bottom of the 
.pinerc work??

Thanks in advance.

Can the above be modified to open an alternative folder if
inbox in empty

an alternative to $MAIL could be /var/spool/mail/$USER 

I would like pine to open my mbox where I save all messages
that have been read.

I just took a call this morning from a person who is trying to install
Pine as an *in-house* mailing system in Alabama: that is, they don't
have Internet connectivity or even a UUCP link, and coming into the lab
here isn't really practical.  He's willing to pay shipping, etc., if
someone will send him disks containing both Unix and DOS versions of
Pine.

I told him I'd pass the information along to you and have you mail a
response either way.  His address is:

Message-Id: <stankerr-1008941641080001@opus.cso.uiuc.edu>

Many of our people now use pine, but are constrained by quotas on system
mailbox space. In one case I saw this week, a person with a lot of mail
was over quota and tried to use pine to delete a bunch of messages, so as
to get under quota. She did everything correctly to delete the messages,
and pine politely asked for confirmation when she exited. However, the
messages were not deleted. I tried it myself and it did the same thing.
Finally I resorted to good old Berkeley 'mail', which had no trouble at
all removing messages.

Our systems folks are overworked and not excited about poring over pine's
code to see how this problem might be addressed, so they're basically
ignoring it (as far as I can tell). If someone has solved it, and can pass
along the solution, we would be grateful.

I don't know about the former.. But, I *DO* know that you can set it so 
that there is no y/n question when you exit.  also, because I move mail 
to other boxes often, I set pine so that it wouldn't question me on 
expunge.  Check yer .pinerc file

I also use both Pine and Elm for mail and what I've done is link 
each of their folder directories (mail for Pine and Mail for Elm) 
to a directory called Folders.  This way you avoid having to change
settings in the .pinerc and elmrc.  Here's one way to do this:

cd
mkdir Folders
cp mail/* Folders/*
cp -i Mail/* Folders/*
mv Mail/redundant_filename Folders/new_filename
ls Folders
rm mail/*
rm Mail/*
rmdir mail
rmdir Mail
ln -s Folders mail
ln -s Folders Mail


Hope this is helpful,
Nancy

Tim,
There is indeed a lot new in Pine 3.90, but there is still much more to 
be done, e.g. IMAP4 compatibility, hierarchy support, white pages dir. 
support, offline operation, additional MIME capabilities, etc, etc.

We're saving "4.0" for some of those, especially IMAP4 compatibility,
as in "Pine 4 supports IMAP 4".

Procmail comes with program formail which can be used to transform a
digest to a email folder. After transformation you can use pine to
answer to the author of a piece.

1. Use pine export command to save the digest to a file and exit pine.

2. Type 'formail +1 -ds cat <digest_file >>~/mail/some_folder'

3. Type 'pine -f some_folder'

4. Select the piece and press 'r' (pine reply command).

Message-Id: <32cta5$drh@lyra.csx.cam.ac.uk>

I am using Pine 3.89 under SunOS 4. When I use reply for
a message in INBOX an A gets prefixed to signify that
I have answered the email. I have configured PINE to
autosave all read messages to a folder mbox. When I now
open mbox the message is now flagged as N. Is this
a bug/feature. This sort of defeats the purpose of
the A flag, which I find very useful

Hello everyone, I know this is a PINE forum, but I don't know where else
to turn. I am currently at a school that uses PINE, but am soon moving to 
a position at a school that uses EUDORA. Any information on this program
would be appreciated. Especially information on where to find more 
information on the net.........Thanks in advance

The Pop program moves all of the current mail to a file called something like:

.julie.pop

So when you run Eudora, all of your mail is put into this file.  The file
isn't emptied until all messages are read.

>PINE only showed 12 messages in my IN box.

These must have come after you aborted Eudora.  New mail goes into the regular
mail box, and isn't copied until you read it with Eudora.

>When I reloaded Eudora it still showed around 1300 messages to be transferred.

Once again, the 12 messages were appended to your .pop mail file and
removed from your regular mail box.

HI,
	I am looking for a version of pc-pine for novell that will
work with a vax running the PMDF IMAP Daemon. It seems that the
version 3.89 from ftp.cac.washington.edu is not compatible. When
adding files to a folder it isssues an APPEND command and not a COPY
command like the VAX IMAP wants.
	Any ideas?
		Neal.

Since PICO is the editor part of pine, I thought I would ask here. 

We  have PICO 2.3 on OS/F1 and find the ^^ key combination to mark text 
does not work. I see the help message from time to time saying Ctrl-^ 
would work to mark text.

The only thing I get is a message that this is an unknown key.

I am also in need of a simple way to do this. If readers
responded to Mr. Chang via e-mail, I wonder if they could
also e-mail me or (BETTER) post a response.

Hi guys,
Admirable work on PINE.  We use it of 15 nodes (HPs and RS/6000s) here at 
the Bureau.  Thus my problem....
 
We have 6 Interactive Unix nodes.  Interactive does not come with a compiler.
Called them up and tried buying one, (Liant-C) but it doesn't work (they 
told me to send it back).  Tried to find the the gcc stuff but it appears 
to be missing the link editor (ln).
 
Would GREATLY appreciate if you could 
provide-for-me/point-me-in-the-right-directiion of either a complete 
public domain C compiler for Interactive version 3, or already compiled 
versions of PINE, PICO, TIN, and GOPHER.  It's worth a lunch (Pizza Hut 
certificate ok?).  (Sent a note to Andy Brager, but don't know if he's 
still around.)
 
Thanks,

You can only see this line if you look at the full header.

	Message-ID: <Pine.3.89.9408120155.A11281@kelly.teleport.com>

I can guess at the first part (pine ver 3.89) and the last part (I'm 
mailing from kelly.teleport.com)  But what is the big long number in between?

It changes each time I mail something.  But there doesn't seem to be a 
rhyme or reason to what influences the number.

As for A11281, I assume that is the sendmail ID# that was assigned, but I

It looks like you wrote that letter at 1:55 on the 12th of the 08 month 
in 1994...i.e. the number is a serial number that uniquely identifies 
every message that travels in the NET

The primary purpose of the Message-ID is to be unique.  Pine does supply a
bit of information there, but opther mailers don't.  Basically, the first
number is the date and time, but I don't recall where the second one comes
from offhand...

Could you explain the symptoms?  Does it not work at all or is there an
error message?  Does ^J work outside the headers?

Pine should run without any config files beyond the .pinerc file which it
creates the first time you run it.  As an experiment you might try setting
smtp-server in your .pinerc file.

Our Documentation & Training department has asked me if it would be
possible to get an advance copy of the release notes (or any other
documentation) for Pine 3.90.  They'd like to get a head-start on
editing our manuals.

Subject: Pine and disk quotas

A few days ago I posted the note below to comp.mail.pine; when I heard of
the pine mailing list I decided to subscribe and try the question here as
well.


Many of our people now use pine, but are constrained by quotas on system
mailbox space. In one case I saw this week, a person with a lot of mail
was over quota and tried to use pine to delete a bunch of messages, so as
to get under quota. She did everything correctly to delete the messages,
and pine politely asked for confirmation when she exited. However, the
messages were not deleted. I tried it myself and it did the same thing.
Finally I resorted to good old Berkeley 'mail', which had no trouble at
all removing messages.

Our systems folks are overworked and not excited about poring over pine's
code to see how this problem might be addressed, so they're basically
ignoring it (as far as I can tell). If someone has solved it, and can pass
along the solution, we would be grateful.

I would like to use Procmail to filter my messages in Pine, but am having 
problems setting it up. If there is anyone who does this, could you 
please lend me a hand? The main problem is that I can't read the man 
pages because they are [nt]roff'ed and it appears DG/UX does not include 
anything to let you read the format. TIA

Subject: PINE seg faults when run in an xterm?
Date: 12 Aug 1994 20:59:17 GMT
Message-Id: <32gnr5$qfa@usenet.srv.cis.pitt.edu>

	A while back, I saw various reports of pine catching a SIGSEGV
while trying to exit if being run in an xterm.

	One posted solution was to not run pine in an xterm directly,
but to instead run a script something like this:

#! /bin/sh
pine ${1+"$@"}
RETSTAT=$?
sleep 1
exit $RETSTAT

	My question is: was the definitive cause of the SIGSEGV ever
found?  Pine is not the only program that has (had?) the mysterious
xterm SIGSEGV problem, so I'm very interested in determining whether
or not the source of the problem was ever found.

	Please reply via email.  I will summarize if necessary.

Didn't you ever hear that the documentation is the last thing to get 
done? ;)

Seriously, we are working furiously to finish the docs for 3.90, but if you
have a deadline that can't wait a week for the release, drop us a note at
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu and we'll see if we can work something out...

Actually, there is a bi-directional gateway between pine-info and 
comp.mail.pine, so you don't need to post both places...

Due to the way Pine is implemented and the structure of the Berkeley
(default) mailbox format, the act of reading a message for the first time
increases its size by a few bytes for status information.  It would be
possible for Pine/c-client to decrease the impact, but it would entail a
performance penalty that we do not feel is justified. 

Pine does support alternate formats, e.g. Tenex, that do not have those
problems, but unfortunately other tools like mail and elm do not support
them.

  In Pine's Address Book, the command "S" will enable you to create a
mailing ("distribution") list. Give the list a long name, e.g., Alcohol
Beverage Control; then a short name, e.g., abc. The command "Z" enables
you to add an address to the list. 

  When sending a message to the group, enter <Control-R> in the header; 
"Bcc:" will appear. After "Bcc:" simply enter "abc". Your entire mailing
list will appear. When the message is sent, no recipient will know who
else has received it.

Does this mean the release of 3.90 is within a week or so instead of a 
few weeks? :-)

Just curious?

A professor recently posed an interesting question to me. He receives 
e-mail regularly from the National Academy of Sciences and when he 
finishes reading the message and deletes it, he is asked to send a return 
receipt. This process happens automatically. Pine also know the return 
address of the person who is supposed to recieve the return receipt. all 
he has to do is answer yes. Does anyone know how this happens? Also, how 
would one set up such a system so he can do the same for e-mail he sends. 
TIA.

As far as I can gather the max is 40!  Try it and see.

> Is there a Windows version of the Pine mail program ?

Jerry,
The answer is "yes and no"...

In the upcoming(*) Pine 3.90 release, we intend to include an "alpha"
version of "PC-Pine for Winsock".  Note that this is not a full Windows
GUI application.  Rather, it has the same character-based User Interface
as Unix and DOS Pine. 

Unlike PC-Pine for DOS:
 o You can resize the window.
 o There is *limited* Windows cut/paste (this will be improved soon).
 o There is a Windows printer interface
 o It uses the Winsock network interface

Like PC-Pine for DOS:
 o Mouse can select commands, messages, and Composer cursor position
 o Some Unix Pine functions are not available:
	-integral spelling checker 
	-alt editor 
	-pipe command
 o Performance optimization hasn't been done yet (esp. for index sort)


(*) now shooting for approx 94.08.22

There is no defined limit.  Pine 3.89 and before store the entire list in
memory, so there will be a practical limit though...

What version of PC/TCP are you using?  Or are you using a different

If I understand correctly, some 3rd-party person ported Pine 3.89 to 
Linux when it was release.  I am curious as to if 3.90 will work with 
Linux right out of the box or if use Linux people will have to wait for 
somebody to port it?

This comment from adrbklib.h (pine 3.89) indicates that each entry in
the addressbook can contain up to 1000 addresses. I tested this while
writing a little program that converted VMS distribution lists to pine
addressbook entries and I think I got 1010 or so before pine dumped
core. 

from adrbklib.h:
/* There are no restrictions on the length on any of the fields. This current
   code restricts the number of addresses in a list to 1000.

We have gone to considerable effort to upgrade addressbook support in Pine
3.90 to handle huge addressbooks with reasonable performance.  One of our
test addressbooks has over 10,000 entries.  Pine 3.89 does crash on a
sendmail bug with large numbers of recipients, but that is also solved in 
Pine 3.90...

Hi, I am using Pine 3.89 in SunOS and HP-UX. The header (long) mode seems
doesn't work. If I type either h or H I only heard beep.
In Pine 3.85 it worked.

Message-Id: <1994Aug15.095413.3138@huxley.physiol.ox.ac.uk>
Date: Mon, 15 Aug 1994 09:54:13 GMT

The system wide pine.conf file for the Pine 3.89 installation in our
department has the "news-collections" variable set so that users can
read news from an NNTP server in another department using Pine. However
I prefer to read new using a threaded news reader rather than Pine.
Unfortunately I can't stop pine from showing me the news collection.
This is particularly annoying because the NNTP server can be a bit
flakey at times an I like to run Pine with the "expanded-view-of-folders"
option turned on. The news can slow down the opening of the "FOLDER
LIST" screen considerably.

Can anyone suggest something for me to put in my pinerc file to turn off
news access? I tried 

	news-collections=""

which *almost* does what I want, but causes Pine to generate an error
message everytime it starts up :-

	Bad context, No '[' in context : ""

Anybody got a better solution? I can modify the pine.conf file if need
be (I'm the sysadmin :-)) but I don't want to mess up news access for
Pine users who want to continue using Pine for news.

Regards,

--

Hi all,

Does anyone know if there is a problem running PC-Pine for PC-NFS on DOS 6
machines?  It runs fine on DOS 5 machines but when I try to run it on a 
DOS 6 machine it is unable to find the host machine containing my incoming
mailbox.  The PINERC file is the same for both versions of DOS.

Hellow pine users,

We are using pine 3.89 at work, and are happy  with it.
We are running it on the tcpip-net internal, on a unix server,
and with pc-pine on the local PC's.

What I would like to ask you, is whether some of you have experience 
with pine on your HOME computer, and how to integrate it with the 
unix-server at work, via a modem, but without needing to do a login
at the server.

I am using uupc, and have been thinking of something like:
1) transfer /usr/spool/mail/mymail over modem to my HOME PC
2) do the mailjob (read, reply, compose)  with pine
3) transfer the result back to the server via modem

I would like some comments on the above items, to do the setup
correct.

In advance thanks, and best regards, Hans Peter

Hello,

I have been trying to get pc-pine to work with PC-NFS (various versions)
but have not been successful.  I get the following error message:


	Opening INBOX

	Host not found: atlas.chemistry.uakron.edu


where, atlas.chemistry.uakron.edu is our mailhost.  The PC is a 286
running PC-NFS version 3.5 using an EtherLink 3c503 ethernet card.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Hello there...

I am presently trying to compile
Pine (3.89 or 3.87, the version 
doesn't really matter to me) on
a system with Solaris 2.2. as the OS.

I have found pre-compiled binaries
of both Pico and Pine for the system,
and they work wonderfully, but Pine
defaults to having 4 debug reports,
whereas I want to disable the debug
option altogether (by editing pine/osdep/os-sv4.h)
and setting the number of reports to 0.

All I want to do is change this one
little thing, but when I try to compile
with 'build sol' it fails every-time.

It could be a C-compiler problem, I have
gcc here, and the version of cc (/usr/ucb/cc) 
doesn't fit the bill at all it seems...

I have tried compiling for the Solaris
platform on another system with both
cc and gcc, and still failed...

Everything I try always elicits the 
results... '.../c-client/osdep.h:49: sys/utime.h: 
No such file or directory...

But if it can seemingly find the other
include files (such as sys/type.h)...
why doesn't it find that one???

Am I doing something patently wrong?

Can anyone help? Has anyone 
successfully compiled Pine
under Solaris? Any help will
be most gratefully received,
although preferably by Email.

Thanks!

Peter Bates,
University of Bradford.

I use pine 3.89 on a linux machine at home with no special port.  I have
used the same source and re-built for SunOS 4.1.3, HP-UX 8.0 and linux 
kernel 99.14 without any problems.  The linux distribution I use is 
debian and it came with elm.

Hope this helps.

I am using Pine 3.89 on SunOS 4.1.3 and HP-UX 8.0 and have no problems 
with headers.  Do you have 'old-growth' or 'use-full-header' included in 
feature-list in your .pinerc file?

Unfortunately, PC-Pine does not currently run in that setup.  The current
PC-Pine model is to connect to the server via a SLIP or PPP connection....

Well, does /bin/mail work as a mail submission agent?  It looks to me 
(like I said in that last message) like you've got some funky permissions 
problems within the MMDF subsystem, or worse.  I finally looked up the 
permission command you should run, so try typing:

# /etc/fixperm -nd MAIL /etc/perms/*

which will report, but not repair, all the errors of the MAIL subsystem 
as defined by the files in the /etc/perms directory.  'man fixperm' for 
more information.

Let me know.

That's my port, and I'm running 3.2v4.2 here.  I can't say what's up with 
the date.  The system date is OK, right?

Someone once mentioned that to me.  Do you remember what the error was?  
In a sense, though, this isn't an ODT port, so some problem are possible 
if I inadvertantly used any non-ODT functions.  Or, if you don't mean 
ODT, and this is really a 2.0 version, ye gods, that's old.  I had this 
built with the latest TCP/IP and development system.  Who knows what 
might have changed since then.

Well, I haven't seen anything here.  Try writing some small programs to 
check the system date and time from C, and see what you get.  It's always 
possible that Pine is just reflecting a symptom of a larger problem.

Well, at least Pine isn't the problem.  Pine doesn't touch your 
underlying mail system at all in its operation.  What you should probably 
do, to ease your mind a bit, is only use /bin/mail until you've either 
fixed the delivery problem, or satisfied youself that Pine isn't causing 
the problems.

Check your permissions on all the MMDF stuff.  I don't, of course, 
remember the correct command to issue, but you'll want to run (I think 
it's called) checkperms on the MMDF package to see if there's a part that 
should be setuid that isn't, or vice versa.  If root can do something 
that the rest of the world can't, it's more than likely a permissions 
problem.  But this is, at its heart, a MMDF problem.

I presume that other PC-NFS applications (e.g. telnet) can access
atlas.chemistry.uakron.edu without problem?  Checking our nameserver, it
appears that atlas.chemistry.uakron.edu is a dual-homed host (has two
ethernet addresses).  The reason I mention this is that we have recently
recieved a couple other similar reports that we have been unable to explain
with PC-Pine trying to access dual-homed hosts.  A second problem I noticed
is that atlas.chemistry.uakron.edu does not appear to have an IMAP server
running. 

If you are still unable to get PC-Pine running, please send details to 
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.  Thanks!

Hi

I realize pc-pine does not support windows yet, but can't I create a
pif file to run pine.exe, so that I can run pc-pine in full screen
while still in the windows environment???

I am trying to do this, but when I click on the icon, it starts pc-pine
and then goes back to the program window - is there a setting I am
missing?????  By the way, pc-pine works fine from DOS.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm new to this group and apologize if this is an old topic. I did not see
a FAQ. 

I use PINE on my unix machine. I have recently gotten dial-up PP access
and am using Eudora on my mac at home. Is there a Mac. version of pine or
some program that works well with it?

Eudora is working fine but now I have half my mail in my pine folders and
half in Eudora. I currently have Eudora leave the mail on the server so
that way I can at least have all my received mail in one place. Any mail I
write from Eudora never goes to pine, though. I would like to avoid
sending myself copies of all mail, if possible.

Thanks in advance,
Peter Andrews

I think you have to enable this feature in your pinerc file.  Try 
adding it to your feature-list as follows:

feature-list=enable-full-header-cmd, list of other features

I am running Pine 3.90 under SuOS 4

I have placed old sent-mail and old mail in a subdirectory on another
disk which has a link to my mail subdirectory. When I use Goto folders
and browse down to the relevant directory I cannot enter it. 

Does Pine support alternative folder sub-directories?

How do I access them?

Any ideas welcome!

One of our more observant users noticed that the time (0155 in the above
example) was not in fact the hours and minutes value from the time as he
expected.  It turns out that it is the hours and seconds of the time.  We
reported this "bug" as a very low priority curiosity to the Pine team, and
I understand that it will be "fixed" in 3.90.

Hi,

	Does anyone know of another way which might be faster ? I've 
heard it suggested to use UUCP, but I've no idea how to do this, as I

The Message-ID header is required by the Internet mail standards to
provide a unique identifier for each mail message. This ID can then be
quoted as a reference when generating replies etc. The Netnews system
uses something similar to allow threaded readers to associate follow-ups
with the articles which prompted them.

The number in the middle of the string seems to be made up from the
current date and time and, I would guess, the process ID of the Pine
which generated the message.

94 - year
08 - month
12 - day
0155 - perhaps it was mailed at 01:55 GMT?
11281 - I would think this is a process ID.

However the contents arn't really important.

Regards,

Can the PC resolve the name to an IP address? Can you get IP packets
back and forth between the mailhost and the PC? Try ping and telnet from
the DOS command line - this should give you some clues as to where the
problem lies.

PC-NFS uses NIS for name resolution. Have you tried pointing Pine at
"atlas" or "atlas.chemistry" rather than the full domain name?

I am the author of Spruce.

Unfortunately I have been so busy with my work since May that I haven't
had any time to finish Spruce up to distribution quality yet. 
The summer has also been so nice that I've spent all my spare time 
outdoors. When the autumn rains begin, that's when it's good time to start
writing code again. Hope that doesn't come too soon :-)

I have also been waiting for PINE 3.90 release, and hoping to upgrade
Spruce to same level at once.

Those who are interesed and have a decent WWW client can take a look
at some documentation I started in May at:

http://dshp02.trs.ntc.nokia.com:3000/Spruce/Spruce.html

Especially interesting should be the interface description with screen
captures at:
http://dshp02.trs.ntc.nokia.com:3000/Spruce/interface.html

One can also download an uuencoded demo executable for HP9000/7xx.
The WWW server is located in Finland (see /~leiman/Finland.html)
so the network connection may s l o w from somewhere like Seattle,
or even down sometimes.

The source code of Spruce is at an ugly messy state and I ought to 
clean the source directory up before I dare to show that stuff publicly.

This is an idea I have been thing for some time:
================================================
As soon as I find time, I'll start a major cleanup at Spruce source
directory and put it all publicly available through HTML hypertext
links. The HTML would also document the code a bit, making it reasonably 
easy to see the structure of the code. How does this sound?

I also have to figure out how to configure my httpd (WWW server) to
act as an ftp proxy, so that I could distribute source code and
compiled binaries from my own host. The biggest problem here is to
assure system security against hacker penetration.

I have been contacted by many people who have expressed a keen interest 
in porting the Spruce code for various platforms. Perhaps this way
also compiled binaries can be provided.

Currently I have very little time to read news, so I may not read this
newsgroup too often.

when using replay to, if the sender has a name like:
"Blow, Joe" <joeblow@some.com>
pine will split the line after "Blow, ..." in the same way that it does it
when you have mail that goes (in replay) to several receipients...

I do not know if this cause a problem by itself (I correct this manually
deleting the offending coma), but, sometimes (specially when quick answering
to some mail with a mere yes or no), the editing could be anoying.

Is that solved in 3.9... or there is something that I can do in 3.89 that I
did not notice (the question for 3.89 is because I'm not overlly optimist
that netcom will install 3.9 pronto...)

: did not notice (the question for 3.89 is because I'm not overlly optimist
: that netcom will install 3.9 pronto...)


It looks to me like it's fixed in 3.90, but I'd have to wait for the 
final version to come out.  Anyway, even though it shows the addresses 
incorrectly in the composer, there is no danger to send them right back 
out unedited.  I do this all the time without problems.  I don't think it 
could possibly be a problem unless you're sending to many addresses, and 
at the particular place where that address is, Pine wants to break a 
line.  But for normal usage, no problem.  That is to say, it never broke 
for me, but I never do anything truly weird with mail.

Subject: Updating the INBOX?
Date: 16 Aug 1994 19:47:39 GMT
Message-Id: <32r54r$tk1@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

I have a question in Unix Pine 3.89... I know it only checks my 
incoming mail file at intervals, and that I can force it to do so by 
eXpunging deleted messages or by quitting and restarting mail.

On occasion, I will send a message while my inbox is empty... I have 
Pine set to put my outgoing messages in the inbox, however, I can't 
make the message I just sent appear in my inbox (so I can file it and 
go on to doing something else) without either waiting or quitting and 
restarting.

Is there any kind of "update" command that will check /usr/spool/mail 
and add new messages immediately to the index of the inbox?

Help!

Trying to compile pine3.89 (from jagubox).

Attached is the result of a BUILD AUX.   Pico goes fine.
They are all erroring on the lack of ability to find library libiberty.a
I found a note on it that gave me some vague information in the 
pine_diffs.notes
but it was not specific enough (where do I get it in gcc and where do I 
put it and what does it have to do with memmove?!?).

Can anybody help?

Thanks,
Gary

You can have access as many directories as you want.  Just list them on the
folder-collections line in your .pinerc file (comma separated list).

It looks like your system has not been configured properly.  Check your
/etc/hosts file to make sure it is configured properly.  It also looks like
your news software is using similar unconfigured defaults...

instead of invoking pine, call the "old" mail... (in unix)
mail will give you either a "no mail for ..." or a list of your mail...
then press "q". is much faster than pine. Sometimes I use this 
before deciding if i will use pine to read the mail...

Pucho

(I now there are scripts to give you an alert each time that you have mail,
listing from and subject, and also will give you that info at any time)

	With Pine you can use the same filter command and filter-rules
file in the $HOME/.elm -directory as you would use with Elm.

Hello:
	I have a problem when composing or editing letters in pine.  My 
signature (from .signature) is always posted at the bottom of the 
editor.  This is fine except that when I invoke ^T to check the spelling, 
it repeatedly asks for corrections (not being able to recognize names, 
domains etc.)  Is there a way to have the spell checker ignore my signature.

P.S.  This is not a problem when posting news as the signature file is 
appended after the editing and command to send.
						...thanks

I have installed pine 3.89 on our HP. I am using a MAC with small keyboard

supposed to cancel editing and return to Main Menu. However, it return to
quit pine. Is there any bug with my version of pine? How to correct it?
Will it happen in the new version of Pine?

I think you may have your Telnet set up to inercept Ctrl/C and interpret 
it as Interrupt Process.  Try looking in your Session menu at Setup Keys.

No promises, but I rmember there was a funny like this.

Hello there...

I've just compiled Pine3.89
on a Solaris 2.2 system and
it seems to be working fine...

The .pine-debug report however includes this line:

ioctl (TIOCWINSZ) failed :Invalid argument

Is this something I should 
be worried about?

Have I failed to compile it OK?

I would be most grateful
for any help on this matter...

Thanks!

Peter Bates

Is it possible to be more specific about what kind of problem ? It seems to me
that, when using  earlier versions of NCSA Telnet than 2.3.07 r2, no output is
displayed on the screen.

> Are there any plans to include a POP client in Pine?

It's being considered.  The protocol part is easy (and in fact the
C-client libraries include a POP driver), but we have not yet thought
about all the other stuff, e.g. what new configuration variables are
needed to distinguish between the remote INBOX --which is now just an
intermediate drop point-- and the local INBOX you wish to append new
messages to; how to control disconnecting and reconnecting to check for 
new mail, etc, etc.

So, no promises yet, but it could happen --perhaps as an adjunct to the 
offline processing support planned for a future release.

-teg

p.s. I have my own thoughts on why doing this might make sense, even 
though we have no plans to deploy POP at UW, but I'd be interested in 
hearing from you in a private message about why you are interested.

In 3.89 (pico 2.3) it seems pico will set the fill column
according to the window size which is awkward with X-Windows.
Will this be a control argument or user-settable option in 3.90
so that pico can be used with other applications?

Will there ever be the ability to hide distribution list members in the

The new mail check was added in Pine 3.89.  In earlier releases you can press
'N' a few times at the end of the index.

The underlying c-client library that Pine uses now supports POP, so it would
not be hard to hack in POP support, but we are waiting until we can make Pine
behave like a more traditional POP client...

This behaviour is something that I've known about for a long time, but 
only fixed a couple of days ago with the help of Sequent support.

I have implemented this solution on DYNIX/ptx 2.0.4 and it works for me. 
It may or may not work for your operating system, but it's easy to try
out. 

I think you'll find what is happening is that ioctl() is being passed a
window size of 0,0 from UNIX which ioclt() considers to be an invalid
window size. I suspect this problem may be generic to SYSV Unix, perhaps
others can confirm this? 

Confirm what your shell "thinks" your current window dimensions are by
doing an "stty -a", and look for the "rows" and "cols"  values. If they 
are shown as 0 (zero), try this fix:

stty cols `tput cols` rows `tput lines`

This shoud use stty to set window dimensions to those defined in your 
terminfo database according to your TERM variable.

Run Pine again and check your .pine-debug file to see if ioctl is now 
reporting a correct window size.

If you find Pine (and your other programs) are happy with this, you could 
put the line in your /etc/profile.

I hope this helps.

	You could use "filter" from the elm distribution since "filter",
like "procmail", is not tied to a particular UA.  At first glance
procmail seems more difficult to use.....but it is much more flexible
and it is time well spent learning how to use it.

What can you do if your inbox is accessable only via IMAP?  Filter and 
Procmail require access to the mail spool file, as far as I know.  Are there 
any mail filtering tools which use IMAP for getting the mail?

I want to have PC-pine be available to various teachers at the same 
machine.  In order to do this I need separate pine and mail folders for 
each teacher.  These folders could be kept on their Novell home directory 
but it seems as if PC-Pine always wants to place the pine and mail 
folders at the top level of the volume.  Any suggestions?

I hope someone can help me through the confusion.  I'm new to the "Unix world" 
and have recently installed Linux which contains pine.  I was told by my 
internet access provider that pine would allow me to send/receive mail by 
pointing it at the slip service providers system (DIAL.CIC.NET).  In looking 
at the .pinerc, I see where I think I put: {dial.cic.net}inbox.  Is that all I 
have to change?  Do I need smail/sendmail?  My goal is to be able to send and 
receive mail when logged on to my Linux machine.  Does it matter what userid 
I'm logged on to Linux with?  I believe I have to run DIP under root?  After I 
get my slip connection going, do I then logout of root and logon under my real 
internet userid (jblacker) ?  Help!

John,

Setting 

	inbox-path={dial.cic.net}INBOX

is sufficient to take care of your INBOX.  If you want access to folders on
the remote machine, set

	folder-collections="Local Folders"	mail/[],
			   "CIC Folders"	{dial.cic.net}mail/[]

Pine will use sendmail by default to send mail, but if you want to avoid 
the hassle, you can set

	smtp-server=dial.cic.net

to use the remote server for sending.  I don't know the details of DIP 
usage, but I presume you have to start it as root.  Pine will prompt you 
for a username/password on the remote server, so it doesn't really matter 
who you are logged in as on the local machine.

Thanks for the request!

Hi, 
Is there a version of PINE available which supports MH style mail folders ?

If not, will a version be available (& when) and in the meantime, do you
know of any tools to convert MH mail folders into PINE compatible files ?

I'm looking forward to using PINE in anger, but am reluctant to manually
reformat my mail folders !! I think the PINE functionality overall looks
really great !!

Regards

Stuart.

I have a customer who is using PINE on AIX machine with a bunch
of Wyse-60 terminals.

It would seem that the Wyse-60's down arrow key sends a CTRL-J,
which PINE is interpreting as a CR, which doesn't do what they
expect.

What solutions have people used to get PINE to work well
on a Wyse-60 terminal?

	In .pinerc -file of your home directory there is 
	an entry like this:

############################### Preferences ################################

# feature-list= comma-separated list of features from the following set:
# Note: the value "old-growth" is shorthand for the indicated features...

<lines deleted>

# enable-zoom-cmd               (included in old-growth set)

# delete-skips-deleted
# e.g.
# feature-list= old-growth, signature-at-bottom
feature-list=old-growth,
	expanded-view-of-folders,
	signature-at-bottom

Just edit the .pinerc -file and make it look like above.

No..and the cursur UP key deletes lines! (fun, fun fun!)

Since the authours have hard coded the key sequences into PINE, I suppose 
you could try and hack the code to change the keystrokes for Justify, 
etc.

It would be REALLY nice if PINE would use a TERMINFO file :(

Date: 18 Aug 1994 15:01:43 -0400
Message-Id: <330b6nINNiq5@umbc7.umbc.edu>


Hi,

I am running the latest versions of PMDF IMAPD (8-AUG) and of PC-Pine
(3.89).  I have been able to configure PC-Pine to attach to my VMS mail,
read it, delete it and exit.  I can also see my other folders.  However,
when I try to open any of the other folders or I try to compose a message,
it fails with the message

[Error connecting to mail server: Unable to create TCP socket <55>]

or something similar.  This problem occurs even if I am reading my mail 
from VMS, but my smtp-server is a unix host.  Also, if my session is 
connected completely to unix (i.e. inbox, smtp-server, 
folder-collections, etc) then all works fine.

If no one can tell me what the full problem is, can someone at least tell me 
what the error message refers to?

I am attaching my PINERC file below.

Regards and TIA,
Dan

It's more likely telnet that's causing the problem. You're using NCSA 
Telnet for Mac? Hmm... Try hitting command-s (it's the key setup stuff). 
You'll see that "Interrupt" is set to control-c. Hilight that and hit 
delete. Just leave that entry blank, and see if control-c works in pine then.

I'm running Ultrix 4.3a and sendmail 8.6.9.  I've noticed when
I'm notified of New Mail at the shell prompt, PINE does not
recognize the new mail or move the mail out of the spool area.  
If I run the old mail :-(, I find that mail exists.

Do I need to configure something?

I'm running PINE 3.89 on Linux 1.1.44 with SMail 3.1.28 on a SL/IP 
connection with an address that changes every time I connect.  Mail sent 
to those addresses aren't forwarded anywhere else.  I was wondering if 
there is either a way to change the from address of sent mail to 
something different, or add a header field which will redirect replies to 
a different address?

doesn't work but user's conf. does work. 

Can somebody help me, it's time consuming to configure every new users....

After running Pine with a global pine.conf file, take a look at the
.pine-debug1 file.  It will tell you if the /usr/local/lib/pine.conf file was
found and what settings were found in it.

Cool. Please understand that I wasn't criticizing pine on this point - I
think 1,000 entries per list is a reasonable limit. At one point my test
addressbook has over 15,000 entries, divided into approximately 15 lists
with 1,000 entries per list and pine worked just fine. I only hit this
limit because some of our users maintained enormous administrative
mailing lists (~3,000 entries typically) under VMS and wanted to move
them to pine's addressbook, since they were being "encouraged" to move
their email activities from our VMS cluster to our primary unix
email host.

Actually, since it's late and I'm tired :), I'll ramble on a bit. I
think support for huge mailing lists within a MUA like pine or elm or 
mh or whatever is ultimately a misplaced effort. Big mailing lists (where
big >= 100 entries) are best handled by network information providers
(NIS, Hesiod), by an MTA database (sendmail's aliases file for example) or
by a dedicated mailing list manager (e.g. MajorDomo). There's no reason
to force a MUA to bear the burden of parsing and formatting enormous
lists while striving to be "interactive", when such tasks can be more
handled more efficiently and at less cost (in user time and cycles) by a
background MTA or better yet by a list manager on another host. 

I've been spending far too much time with sendmail and BIND lately, so
I'll go get a life now :)

Subject: Help me please .

Hello,

I have problems with linking Pine 3.89.
When i use option of linker '/DYNAMIC' as it is in makefile
the obtained 'pine.exe' simply reboots my PC.
I tried to use old option '/OLDOVERLAY' . Than it partly works.
But for this option Microsoft Linker 5.30 has some restrictions
on using of pointers to functions in different overlays. So i think
that is why it works only partly  after linking with this flag.

I need to use flag 'DYNAMIC' but i cant undersand why the 'pine.exe' doesnt work
after this. I am sure that the only problem with the program is overlays.

I have
i386 
DOS 6.0
PC-NFS 4.0
Microsoft Compiler 7.0
Microsoft Linker   5.30

May be highmem.sys or emm386.exe or PC-NFS is configured wrong.

If it is not difficult would you tell me how i should configure my
PC to make the program work. Or may be i must use another linker.
Or if it  possible would you send me the file 'pine.def' to use
linker with the flag '/OLDOVERLAY'.

Help me please.

Thanks alot.

Ahhh, the way I did it was to reprogram the down, up keys by sending
the following sequences

   <esc>[Z+<newcode><del> --> up arrow
   <esc>[Z,<newcode><del> --> down arrow

this is from memory, but look in the wyse60 manual....

now, does anyone know the sequence to reprogramm a wyse50 which has the
same problem?

That's one possibility. Unless the relevant part of the pine
code has been changed since 3.07, it could have been generated
at 01:xx:55, that is, the hours and seconds, but not minutes,
are used to generate this part of the message id.  It is possible,
therefore, to have two messages with the same message id, posted
on the same day within a one hour window, if the process ids wrap
around within that time; unlikely but possible.

We're receiving MIME enclosures from a Pegasus-based site in the 
Netherlands which are not being recognized by Pine. David Miller was nice 
enough a few weeks ago to show me how to fix the headers so they would be 
recognized, but now the volume is picking up and one user is making demands.

I'll copy a sample header below. Can someone point out either (1) some 
way to make them readable without handling them item-by-item; or (2) 
something I can send back to the Netherlands to have them do differently 
and make the recognizable by Pine; or (3) simply point out why 1&2 are 
not possible and another solution is needed?

Thanks!

I believe that version still has some problems.  The version included with
Pine 3.90 will be more robust.  It should be available early next week.

Depends on what you mean by the ^A problems.  That they continue to exist 
at the end of every message, no, that hasn't been solved there.  The soon-
to-be-released Pine 3.90 (which compiles quite nicely on SCO systems) 
fixes this, largely by completely rewriting the MMDF handling routine.  
It's quite an improvement.  The MMDF handling in 3.89  was much more of a 
hacked-up version of the bezerk module, with a bit to deal with the 
^A^A^A^A before each message.  The one after was ignored.  Alas.

However, if you're having other problems with ^A's, I can't tell you.  If 
you can wait a week, wait for 3.90.  As soon as it's available, I will be 
dropping a binary (and I promise to include man pages this time) on 
soils.  It's worth the wait, if you ask me.

comp.mail.pine is an unmoderated newsgroup which passed its vote for
creation by 421:19 as reported in news.announce.newgroups on 20 May 1994.

For your newsgroups file:
comp.mail.pine		The PINE mail user agent.

The charter, culled from the call for votes:

    This group is for discussion about use and development of the Pine
  mail/news user agent developed by the University of Washington.  Any
  Pine-related and Pine-specific discussion is acceptable, but general
  discussion regarding e.g. MIME or incoming-mail filters is referred to
  other, more appropriate newsgroups.
    The group is not moderated.  To be made moderated, the same procedure
  should be followed as for the creation of a new group at that time.
    The group is bidirectionally gatewayed to the mailing list
  pine-info@cac.washington.edu.

Ok, now I understand that Pine offers *some* support for reading news, 
but looking through the docs has not enlightened me enough. I'm running 
DG/UX 5.4.201 and pine 3.86. I've just managed to get Procmail to sort my 
mail into various incoming mailboxes and even have the system tell me 
which mailbox has just received mail (most of the time).

Now I want to be able to at least *read* news from wherever it is that 
people read their news. My system does not have its own news-reader (I've 
tried, thus far unsuccessfully, to get one working) so I would like to 
hear from other DG/UX users who *do* have a newsreader running and linked 
in with Pine.

Please note that while I am the SysAdmin, I'm a new one. Our VAR did not 
give us much training on the system besides "Here's how you login, here's 
vi.." While I have taken DG's SysAdmin course, it doesn't help much in 
this case. I would greatly appreciate any help that could be provided 
asap as there is information out there that I need to retrieve and the 
person who saw it won't tell us where they saw it. (Separate matter, no 
need for more detail at present)

TIA

Dion

What's the status of encryption?  I'm building a script that provides pgp 
encryption to Pine.  Send your public key, with a solemn promise not to 
laugh at the code, to deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu if you want it.

-- kc

Here's the blurb:

(1) Extract and install mkpgp.

At your Unix prompt, run the command:

   uudecode NameOfTheFileYouArePresentlyReading

An executable script, mkpgp, will be extracted.  Move the
the script into a directory on your path.  One such dir is
usually "bin" in your home directory.  Examine the leading
names of your path variable if you are unsure.  In the unlikely 
event that you don't have access to a dir for executables, see * below.

Run the Unix command

  rehash

*or* logout and login.  Either of these will make your system
"aware" of the new command "mkpgp."


(2) Configure Pine for mkpgp.
Edit .pinerc.  


Set the alternate editor to mkpgp:

# Editor to use in place of Pine's internal composer, Pico
editor=mkpgp

	* Or use an absolute path. E.g., editor=/yourHomeDir/mkpgp

Force Pine to put your signature at the bottom:

# Use old style forward/reply with new text and signature below included text
# Old-style-reply is obsolete, use signature-at-bottom in feature-list
old-style-reply=yes
[...]
# The feature-list that is in effect when you are running Pine
[...]
# of the features is no-, that is, off.
feature-list=old-growth,
        signature-at-bottom

(3) Configure mkpgp

At present, there are only two configuration options in mkpgp.
Edit mkpgp and change lines 3 or 5 if appropriate.

#!/bin/csh -f
# Set the real alternate editor on the next line.
set MKPGPEDITOR=pico
# Determine if sender can read encrypted messages.
set ENCRYPTTOSELF=on

(4) Usage.

My first axiom: I detest pecking on keyboards...

==========
Encryption
==========

Compose a message.
	(a) If you don't use pico, invoke the alternate editor then compose.
	(b) If you do use pico, compose then invoke the alternate editor.
When you (a) exit your editor or (b) invoke the alternate editor,
mkpgp will ask:

	Include encrypted attachment(s)? [n]
	
At every prompt, simply hit the <return> key if you want what's in [].  
(This can be important; don't give mkpgp needless input. Remember my first
axiom.)

Enter y and hit <return> if you want to include attachments in the message
text (thereby encrypting them).  A primitive browser will let you navigate
the file system and attach files and dirs.  You select attachments by 
number.  Hit <return> on a blank line to move up one directory.  Selecting a
single directory is ambiguous (since you are navigating the directories
with the same browser), so you are further prompted to 
"Enter or Attach? [e]" it.  Hit <return> to enter, enter a and hit 
<return> to attach it. If a directory is a member of a list, mkpgp assumes 
it is an attachment.  After collecting all the attachments, enter f and
hit <return>.  $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is listed and you are  a given a
chance edit it.  If you elect to do so, mkpgp will cd to 
$PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach and start a /bin/csh. Do what you will, and use 
the csh command "exit" to return to mkpgp.

mkpgp copies attachments into $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach.  When you exit the 
browser, $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is tar'ed, compress, uuencoded and 
appended to the message text as ascii. $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is then 
removed.

Next, pgp will show your pubkey ring and mkpgp will ask:

	Enter recipient key id(s) [none].

List the recipient key id(s) separated by blanks, or hit <return> if you 
don't want to encrypt the message.

pgp will show your seckey ring and mkpgp will ask:

	Sign the message with a secret key? [n]

y <return> selects the key defined by MyName in $PGPPATH/config.txt. You
can select an alternate by giving a keyid (If you enter n, mkpgp will look
for a key with n in it. Bad news...  Remember the first axiom.  Also, 
beware of the ENCRYPTTOSELF option if you select an alternate key.)

If you elect to sign the message, pgp will request a pass phrase. pgp goes
to work on the message. There is a 5 second delay when pgp is finished so
you can see what happened.  After that you should be looking at the message
in the Pine compose window.  Send it.  If ENCRYPTTOSELF=on, you can decrypt
the copy of the message in sent-mail.  If ENCRYPTTOSELF=off and you didn't
include yourself as a recipient, you might as well delete it.

The actual pgp commands/options used by mkpgp are:

pgp -sew +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF +armor=on +keepbinary=off \
+armorlines=0 +tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $keys $sign

pgp -satw +clearsig=on +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF +keepbinary=off \
+tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $sign

or

pgp -ew +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF +armor=on +keepbinary=off \
+armorlines=0 +tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $keys

$1 is /tmp/pico.xxxx, $keys is the list of keys, $sign is the key id used 
to sign the message.  There are several other calls to pgp to wipe and 
delete temporary files.

==========
Decryption
==========

The only way to decrypt in pine is in a reply or forward since that is your
only access to the alternate editor.  Decryption seems to work ok in a 
forward; replies are still flakey because of the variety of quote 
characters people use (I'll fix this when I have time). 

If mkpgp finds "BEGIN PGP MESSAGE" or "BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE" in the
message, it will run the command:

	pgp +force +interactive=on +keepbinary=off 

and attempt to mimic the forward/reply behavior of Pine.  

If, along the way, 

	begin 600 mkpgpAttach.tar.Z

is found in the message text, mkpgp will unpack the attachments and move 
the mkpgpAttach directory into $PGPPATH (renaming it if needed). The 
mkpgpAttach.tar.Z file is wiped & deleted. You are given a chance to
examine/delete the attachments (exiting the c-shell as before).

If mkpgp finds "BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK" mkpgp runs

	pgp +force +interactive=on +keepbinary=off

to add keys.  This only works in a forward and attachments aren't unpacked.

  (It's easy to fix, I just haven't done it yet. It was an afterthought).

Let me know how it goes.  I'm open to input, but I want to keep it simple.
Contact me again if you want the updates.

It should be reasonably easy to add a compressed folder driver to Pine
(c-client actually), perhaps as little as a few dozen lines of code.  Contact
c-client@cac.washington.edu if you would like some pointers getting
started...

I was wondering how difficult would it be to extend pine to be able to 
read compressed mail folders? I have a lot mail that I need to keep around, 
but rarely read. It would be great if I could gzip them down and when I 
needed to, pine would automatically gunzip them for me.

Thanks to the person who told me I could find Pine for SCO by ftp at 
soils.agron.iastate.edu

All the files have been compressed with gzip (ie have an extention of .gz).  I 
am not familiar with this compression program.

Can someone please tell me what I need to unzip the files.

Also once I have unzipped the programs I am not sure of what steps I need to 
follow to get it up and running.  If anyone has experience of doing this in SCO 
 then can they please provide a simple step by step list.

Thanks in advance

  I really like Pine's composer interface for mail, and would like to

as I get deeper and deeper in it's getting more and more confusing and

Make sure you have a TZ variable in your environment.  I've seen some

Uhhh, the networking libraries are totally different between v2.0t
and v4.x like there is no libnsl_s.a in 2.0 so if you linked Pine 
using that on a newer system then forget it.  I'm not sure what's
going to happen if you try an lstat() (Does pine use it? I didn't
look at the source.) on a 2.0 system but a core dump would be my bet.
Same thing applies to several other library changes.  I'd guess you'd
be hard pressed to get it working on 2.0 without re-writing the port.
I have to maintain both 4.x and 2.0 systems and I'm to the point I
actually have a -DSCO324 or -DSCO322 defined in the gcc spec file
for the various systems....  <yech!>

Hi!

I am running PINE 3.89 under Linux (Slackware distribution)... it seems 
that PINE doesn't even read the timezone info from the system and 
out-going messages always bear "+0000". (as you may probably see now :) 

Any help is appreciated.

Keith

Jessica,

Why would you want to do that? It doesn't make any sense.

Are you speaking of using PICO as the 'composer'?  I replaced the visual
editor pointers in the various newsreader's source code with pico and
it's working fine.  I wrapped pico in a little shell script to work
with the temp files (pico -n if memory serves), and all's well.

The downside is that more folks are posting to usenet now. :)

That is true, pine would not work or should not work with getting WWW 
docs.

If you have pine, and are on a UNIX machine, you can probally already get 
and look up inforamtion using the WWW.

Just type  lynx http://....... and see if it works.

I'd like to run a script in the beginning of every session which
scans specified folders in ~/Mail -directory for unread mail. I'm
using 'filter' in my .forward file to redirect incoming mail from
mailing lists to respective folders. I *do know* that I can use
'filter -s' to get a filter activity summary but the output is not
what I'm lookin for. I'd like to get information like this:

STATUS OF INCOMING FOLDERS:
===========================

Folder name:	Total:	Unread:
-------------------------------
mailing-list1	20	3
mailing-list2	35	6
mailing-list3	5	0
...etc.

You got the idea? The output does not have to be exactly like this
but the information I need should be in tiny column format since there
are about 20 mailing list folders.

I guess this could be achieved by using perl or something. I wonder
if there are ready packages for doing these kind of summaries????

	Thanx! -=Marko=-

I'm sorry guys... I didn't realise that all the postings made to the
group 'comp.mail.pine' are echoed to the pine-info list... Anyway,
even though my question doesn't involve Pine at all, I'd be happy
to find an answer to the problem.

A couple of months ago I wrote a quick-and-dirty C program that should 
work in most Unix environments.  I've included it and a man page as 
attachments.  It doesn't print exactly what you are looking for, but it
may be close enough.  It checks for unread mail in mail folders and 
prints out lines as in

	Unread mail in /usr/spool/mail/heck
	Unread mail in Mail/Chatter
	...

Nothing is printed out for folders that do not have any unread mail.  It
should be fairly easy to modify the code to print other relevant
information.

Most likely your pine wasn't properly configured for Linux, and is
using the wrong definition of rfc822_date.  Try using the following
definition of rfc822_date instead.

It would simplify porting if imap used the following code,
which is more portable (though a tiny bit less efficient)
than the zillions of rfc822_date variants that come with the
imap distribution.

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <time.h>

char *months[] = {"Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
		  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"};

char *days[] = {"Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"};

#define TM_YEAR_ORIGIN 1900

/* Return difference between a and b, in minutes (ignoring seconds).  */
static time_t difftm(a, b)
	struct tm *a, *b;
{
  int ay = a->tm_year + (TM_YEAR_ORIGIN - 1);
  int by = b->tm_year + (TM_YEAR_ORIGIN - 1);
  return
    (
      (
	/* difference in day of year */
	   a->tm_yday - b->tm_yday
	/* + intervening leap days */
	+  ((ay >> 2) - (by >> 2))
	-  (ay/100 - by/100)
	+  ((ay/100 >> 2) - (by/100 >> 2))
	/* + difference in years * 365 */
	+  (time_t)(ay-by) * 365
      )*24 + (a->tm_hour - b->tm_hour)
    )*60 + (a->tm_min - b->tm_min);
}

/* Write current time in RFC 822 format
 * Accepts: destination string
 */

void rfc822_date (date)
	char *date;
{
  time_t time_sec = time (0);
  struct tm gm, *t;
  int zone, signzone, abszone;

  gm = *gmtime (&time_sec);
  t = localtime (&time_sec);
  zone = difftm (t, &gm);
  signzone = zone < 0 ? '-' : '+';
  abszone = abs (zone);
  sprintf (date, "%s, %d %s %d %02d:%02d:%02d %c%02d%02d",
	   days[t->tm_wday], t->tm_mday, months[t->tm_mon],
	   t->tm_year + TM_YEAR_ORIGIN,
	   t->tm_hour, t->tm_min, t->tm_sec,
	   signzone, abszone/60, abszone%60);
}

I have a wyse terminal and I wish to use pine.  Unfortunately
the program always causes an extra line to appear at the 
bottom of my screen, which causes the top line to be scrolled
away, and which also causes highlighting on the page to
work improperly.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

I briefly heard from somewhere about a convert.exe command that can be 
used in your home dir to decipher a WP 5.1 (or any ASCII text file) that 
is attached to an email and both sites have Pine 3.89

There can be a tremendous use for this command if I can find it anonFTP 
anyone know where it can be had?

Thanks,

: Jessica,

: Why would you want to do that? It doesn't make any sense.

: Lance

  It makes sense if you send hypertext (HTML) mail...if I'm writing somebody
about WWW, I find it easier to put an HTML command (like 
<a href="gopher://ais.org"> this </a>) right inside the message, and if you 
view it as HTML, you can just "click" on the link to see what I'm talking
about...I use elm and just pipe my message in; Pine might be able to handle 
it as part of a MIME message.  Or by just exporting it to a file and typing 
"lynx filename".

Beware when you use Eudora on Mac and probably on Pc, it is not just
transfer your income mail, but it also delete it from your host server.

Yeah, you want to do it the other way; have your WWW browser
behave as a MIME-compliant mail reader as well. I'm not sure that
any do that yet, however.

I have a utility that you (and others) might like. It is still
"beta" (and I think it'll stay beta forever, and be superceded by
browser functions like the above, but I digress), but it works.

Take a peek at: http://www.ucalgary.ca/~jsbell/tools/fwebp.html

Or, if you're not using a utility like that, and want it as an anchor:

<html>
<a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~jsbell/tools/fwebp.html">
This will take you to the documentation</a>
</html>

(It requires Perl and runs under Unix, for the record.)

I use it for doing exactly what the above poster suggests
(although you can't pipe things to Lynx on my system) using
macros in my newsreader and mailer programs. Suggestions and
comments greatly appreciated (as would be an offer to help make
it handle MIME documents, but again I digress).

Save from mail to a file. If you have the program uudecode, you are in luck.
All you have to do is type uudecode <filename> and you have a unencoded file. There are other encrypting schemes so if this doesn't work, you will have to find out what he used. Hope this helps.

Message-Id: <1994Aug21.135252.2299@birdland.rhein-neckar.de>
Date: Sun, 21 Aug 1994 13:52:52 GMT

Hello!

I'm using pine for everyday mailing without big problems. However, one 
problem remains: pine uses MIME quoted printables for special characters
and even for very usual ones like TAB or CR. A lot of my friends use 
software without MIME-support, so my mails are funny looking or plain
unreadable.

How can I configure pine to send all 7-bit ASCII-Characters without MIME-
quoting? I found nothing in the documentation  bout this problem.

Any help will be appreciated. 

Martin

( Sorry, Ralph, I mailed a response to you when I meant to post it... 
here's basically the same thing again)

  Sort of; I like the way it works within Pine, with a regular Pico 
editor on the lower half of the screen, and a set of headers at the top.  
I'd like to change these headers to things appropriate to news, such as 
"Newsgroups:" and "Distribution:".  I'd LIKE Pine to parse the headers 
for me, but I can certainly live with doing it myself.  Any suggestions?

  Thanks,

------Scott.

  If you don't mind losing MIME altogether, you can recompile without the 
"#define MIME" (or something like that; maybe MIME_ENABLED); it's an ugly 
solution, but ought to work (you may have to wrap a few things in 
"#ifdef MIME"s )...

In Pine 3.89, even if you had the extra headers, it would not allow you to
post News.  The good news is that Pine 3.90 will be out very soon and will
allow you to post News and configure whatever headers you want!

If you only have 7-bit characters in the message, Pine will not encode it. 
But if you have even one 8-bit character there is no way to prevent
encoding...

Will a pine imapd client (local) connect and talk with a pop3 server

(In the sparse install/config docs it briefly mentions that the imapd

Huh?  There is no such #define in Pine.  You must be thinking of some other
program...

That feature is not available in Pine 3.89 and earlier, but will be 
available in Pine 3.90.

Imapd is a server, not a client.  The c-client in the latest IMAP toolkit
does provide a POP driver, so Pine could be made to use POP without great
difficulty.  Pine 3.90 will not have it enabled by default though.

How does a user coerce Pine into using something besides sendmail?
"Something" would use exactly the same args as sendmail and would
ultimately call on sendmail to deliver the message.

Thank you very much for this info. Although "stty -a" didn't reveal
any info about the settings for "columns" and "rows" on our system
(SINIX 5.41, a SysVR4), I just tried your suggestion and it did indeed
resolve the ioctl error message.

One minor correction: On our system, the correct syntax is

stty columns `tput cols` rows `tput lines`

This is the GNU Zip program from the Free Software Foundation, which you 
can find on prep.ai.mit.edu.  I'm not sure what it takes to build it any 
more, but it doesn't do anything really strange, so you should be able to 
work it out.  It will require a compiler.

Pine needs nothing, really, to run, except the program.  When you first 
start it up, it will create a directory "~/mail" to store its folders in, 
and a file .pinerc, which it stores its settings.  It will also look in 
the file /usr/local/lib/pine.conf for a system-level .pinerc.  So, a good 
step-by-step:

Unpack program.
Move to /usr/local/bin/pine, set permissions to 755, owner bin.bin.
Run program.
Take .pinerc as generated, fill in the system-wide fields, copy to
    /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  Useful system-wide settings are things
    like SMTO-server or features.

That's it.

_HOWEVER_: Within the next couple of days, Pine 3.90 is coming out, which 
has many nice, advanced features, including vastly better MMDF support, 
News posting, implementing some historically unimplemented features, 
etc.  It compiles "out of the box" on SCO Unix, and I'll have the binary 
on soils as soon as I can get it there.

I'd recommend waiting.

Actually, I'd recommend getting a copy of gzip, too.  If there isn't one 
on soils, I'll put one there.  Pine-3.90 will be gzipped, too.

I have been using pine for about a month. Pine is MIME-supported. However,
our site has no MIME-support software. Therefore, we cannot see any email
with MIME component. Would someone suggest a bunch of MIME-support software
so that I can installed into the system? Freeware or Commercial one does
not matter.

Answer with posting or email is appreciated

    Is there a way to insert the contents of one letter into another 
letter without first having to export the first into a file-text format?  
I would find this particularly helpful in regard to letters I have placed 
in the "sentfile" folder.  Thanks!

	Not only that....it would defeat the whole purpose to "supress
MIME-Support".  What he should be doing is encouraging the other folks
to switch to a MIME capable UA.  Not breaking a working one.

My directory structure for pine folders and collections is like
this: (Unix-Pine)

                                        collections	folders
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	$HOME	-->	mail	-->	Personal -->	john
							jack
							tina

					listmail -->	pine-info
							aikido-list
							NEW-LIST
	
					sent-saves--> 	sent-mail
							sent-mail-feb
							sent-mail-mar

	Etc... My default for saves is mail/Personal/[]
directory and I'm trying to make Pine to save the Fcc: to the
mail/sent-saves/sent-mail -directory. I've put the following line
in my .pinerc -file:

default-fcc=mail/sent-saves/sent-mail 

... but when composing and sending the message I get the error
message stating that there's no such file in 'mail-Personals'.
Pine tries to create the file but it doesn't succeed in it, of
course. Does the sent-mail -file always have to be in the
default directory for saves. I also tried:

default-fcc=mail/sent-saves/[] 

... but it didn't help either.

	Yours, Marko

... Forget about my previous posting about the problem concerning
the Fcc: to subdirectory/sent-mail. It was actually very easy to
solve but I was just too impatient to try all the alternatives.
The answer was to put the full pathname to the fcc-folder= -entry
in .pinerc. I was assuming that Pine will generate all its pathnames
for folders and collections relative to the $HOME/mail -directory.

Thanks anyway for everyone who answered the question!

Hello, it's me again... :-)

	I was wondering, if it is possible to make an Fcc:
to separate sent-mail files according to the receiver (sent-mail-jack,
sent-mail-tina etc.)?? This could be a major advantage since my
sent-mail files tend to expand very large and it is sometimes hard
to find a certain message among a list of 300 messages in the folder.

Some users on campus are experiencing this problem. It has happen while 
using VersaTerm for the Mac, Zstem by KEA! for DOS and on a plain old 
VT320 terminal. Here is the problem:

When someone uses Pine or Pico, and tries using the spell checker, the 
following gets inserted into their document: [Yes] It never starts the 
spell checker. We are running Pine 3.87 and Pico 2.1. Is there some know 
bug? Am I missing something? Help?

No, unfortunately we can't easily change that because it's part of the 
code in Pine, not a preference we can set.  Plus, we want people to 
delete their old mail, and for it to be a slight inconvenience for them 
not to do so :-)

The preferred method to get your initial pine.conf file is to run

	pine -conf > /usr/local/lib/pine.conf

Although they are similar, there are different settings, defaults, and
comments between a pinerc and pine.conf.  Pine 3.90 will also have a
"-pinerc" option to update the comments and otherwise clean up an old .pinerc
file.

I'm a little confused.  I guess I haven't explained our situation and 
desires fully.

The way Pine works here, if you answer "no" to 
the question on storing the previous months old sent mail in 
sent-mail-MMM-YYYY, the sent-mail folder just continues to grow.  What 
we'd like to do is make the sent-mail-MMM-YYYY option the default (if not 
automatic) so that we can compress sent-mail-MMM-YYYY files older than 60 
days and annually write sent-mail-MMM-YYYY.Z files to tape.

Is there a way to do this, or is there a planned feature that will permit 
this, or am I just whistling Dixie?

Thanks,

Can Pine play Audio attachments? If not, why not?
I sort of expected it to use .mailcap and .mime.types
like Mosaic to spawn something.I've got Pine 3.89
on Linux.
.... later..
grepping around in the source I see there is support for audio
for Suns. Perhaps I can hack something..

>From the upcoming Pine FAQ:

How can I filter messages into different incoming folders? 

Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other programs,
such as "procmail", or "filter" or "deliver". 

Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "filter"  program,
then you will have new mail arriving in several different mailboxes/folders,
in addition to your INBOX. 

So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming message"
folders that your favorite delivery filter program has created? Pine's answer
is to let you specify them in your .pinerc, as in the example: 

 
incoming-folders=Consulting       {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-help,
                 Widget-Project   {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-widget,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering program
has been configured to put mail relating to "consulting" into the folder
"filter/to-help" and mail relating to the "widget project" into
"filter/to-widget". 

>From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those folders. 
Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may have new mail
waiting for you, so that you don't "forget" that you have more than one place
to look for new mail...

You can point to an SMTP server by setting the smtp-server variable in your
.pinerc file.  Other than that, there is nothing short of a source change...

Pine only checks for new mail every 2.5 minutes.  You can force a new 
mail check with ^L.

If the username is the same, but the hostname varies, set the user-domain
variable in your .pinerc file.  If the username varies too, wait for Pine
3.90 and set the Reply-To: header.

I think the only reasonable long-term solution is to figure out where the
MIME headers are getting lost.  Your next step is probably to contact the
Postmasters at both ends and see what they can find...

The first step is to find an NNTP server that will let you read news.  Then
edit the news-collections variable in your .pinerc file to point to that
server.  Finally, you need to create a .newsrc file, either with another
newsreader or by hand.  Alternatively, you can wait for Pine 3.90, which will
create the .newsrc for you (and allow posting).

Would it be possible to set up a chroot environment and create your own

Hi,

I've got procmail set up to send my mail into four or five
directories.  I have configured my .pinerc so that these directories
are known to pine as incoming-folders.  This all works fine.

The problem now is that when I am notified of new mail, I have to
look through five folders to see where it is!  

Is there any way to get pine to say which incloming-folder has new mail?  
Or is there any way to configure my .procmailrc so that it sends a
message of the sort
	New mail in folder foo!
Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Jody

	Hadn't you heard?  Pine 3.90 was released on 22 August.  However,
it was a one day only sale.  If you missed picking it up...you must wait
for pine 3.91 due out before the end of "Ghost Month" in Taiwan.  :-) :-)

There's a couple of ways actually. I found an environment variable that 
can be set to check specific paths for mail and display custom messages 
if mail is found. It's not very reliable (I think), but it does seem to 
work. Plus it may be only for the DG, I don't know. I'll include my 
.profile so that you can look at it.

Also, as this has been a hot topic for the past week, another respondent 
to someone else's request included a couple of files he wrote to do the 
checking. I'll attach those files as well. I don't know if, or how well 
they work as I haven't had a chance  to try them, but at least you can 
try them out yourself.

Good luck!

Dion

Sounds easy enough, except for one problem. I don't know how to find one, 
or how to get it to let me read news. I realize that you are a busy 
person, but please remember that I  am a newbie. For the time being I 
need explicit instructions.

Ok. The .pinerc I can do. The .newsrc is a no go. I don't even know what 
goes in one. Maybe if I can get tin to work I'll be able to see one.

Waiting patiently.....Is it done yet? ;-)

I haven't figured out how to attach a file to e-mail through pine.  My real problem lies in how to get a file from my computer to the server so pine can find it.  There is, I'm sure, a very simple method which has escaped me, so will someone please enlighten me.  Thanks in advance!

What is the latest version of Pine? And how can it be obtained (for 
updating)? -- I couldn't find a FAQ!

Can anyone tell me if it is possible to print the entire contents of a

appreciate any help you can give me.  I prefer an E-Mail response.  It's 
difficult for me to get to the newsgroups.

I think it may be sending an 'Are you there?' message on ^T instead of

	It would *really* help if you gave people an idea of what your
configuration looks like......

	What is your computer.....how are you accessing pine now....???

	If you are using a PC (a.k.a. computer) and using a terminal emulator
and loging into a an account to execute pine.....then chance are you need
something like kermit, xmodem, zmodem....to upload the file to your host.
Chances are your terminal emulator package supports one of these...and you
need to find out how to use it in conjunction with your host.

	The latest version of pine is 3.89....howerver, best you wait
a short time and get pine 3.90.  It will be on ftp.cac.washington.edu.

	Inside "sources" indicate it will be worth the wait.....

Is there a way to take address from the current message and
add it to a distribution list? <T> key takes the address and
binds it to an individual nickname - adding to a list-nickname
doesn't seem to work.

Sorry, I didn't mean to followup...

What's the status of encryption?  I'm building a script that provides pgp 
encryption to Pine.  Send your public key, with a solemn promise not to 
laugh at the code, to deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu if you want it.

-- kc

Here's the blurb:

(1) Extract and install mkpgp.

At your Unix prompt, run the command:

   uudecode NameOfTheFileYouArePresentlyReading

An executable script, mkpgp, will be extracted.  Move the
the script into a directory on your path.  One such dir is
usually "bin" in your home directory.  Examine the leading
names of your path variable if you are unsure.  In the unlikely 
event that you don't have access to a dir for executables, see * below.

Run the Unix command

  rehash

*or* logout and login.  Either of these will make your system
"aware" of the new command "mkpgp."

(2) Configure Pine for mkpgp.
Edit .pinerc.  


Set the alternate editor to mkpgp:

# Editor to use in place of Pine's internal composer, Pico
editor=mkpgp

	* Or use an absolute path. E.g., editor=/yourHomeDir/mkpgp

Force Pine to put your signature at the bottom:

# Use old style forward/reply with new text and signature below included text
# Old-style-reply is obsolete, use signature-at-bottom in feature-list
old-style-reply=yes
[...]
# The feature-list that is in effect when you are running Pine
[...]
# of the features is no-, that is, off.
feature-list=old-growth,
        signature-at-bottom

(3) Configure mkpgp

At present, there are only two configuration options in mkpgp.
Edit mkpgp and change lines 3 or 5 if appropriate.

#!/bin/csh -f
# Set the real alternate editor on the next line.
set MKPGPEDITOR=pico
# Determine if sender can read encrypted messages.
set ENCRYPTTOSELF=on

(4) Usage.

My first axiom: I detest pecking on keyboards...

==========
Encryption
==========

Compose a message.
	(a) If you don't use pico, invoke the alternate editor then compose.
	(b) If you do use pico, compose then invoke the alternate editor.
When you (a) exit your editor or (b) invoke the alternate editor,
mkpgp will ask:

	Include encrypted attachment(s)? [n]
	
At every prompt, simply hit the <return> key if you want what's in [].  
(This can be important; don't give mkpgp needless input. Remember my first
axiom.)

Enter y and hit <return> if you want to include attachments in the message
text (thereby encrypting them).  A primitive browser will let you navigate
the file system and attach files and dirs.  You select attachments by 
number.  Hit <return> on a blank line to move up one directory.  Selecting a
single directory is ambiguous (since you are navigating the directories
with the same browser), so you are further prompted to 
"Enter or Attach? [e]" it.  Hit <return> to enter, enter a and hit 
<return> to attach it. If a directory is a member of a list, mkpgp assumes 
it is an attachment.  After collecting all the attachments, enter f and
hit <return>.  $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is listed and you are  a given a
chance edit it.  If you elect to do so, mkpgp will cd to 
$PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach and start a /bin/csh. Do what you will, and use 
the csh command "exit" to return to mkpgp.

mkpgp copies attachments into $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach.  When you exit the 
browser, $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is tar'ed, compress, uuencoded and 
appended to the message text as ascii. $PGPPATH/tmp/mkpgpAttach is then 
removed.

Next, pgp will show your pubkey ring and mkpgp will ask:

	Enter recipient key id(s) [none].

List the recipient key id(s) separated by blanks, or hit <return> if you 
don't want to encrypt the message.

pgp will show your seckey ring and mkpgp will ask:

	Sign the message with a secret key? [n]

y <return> selects the key defined by MyName in $PGPPATH/config.txt. You
can select an alternate by giving a keyid (If you enter n, mkpgp will look
for a key with n in it. Bad news...  Remember the first axiom.  Also, 
beware of the ENCRYPTTOSELF option if you select an alternate key.)

If you elect to sign the message, pgp will request a pass phrase. pgp goes
to work on the message. There is a 5 second delay when pgp is finished so
you can see what happened.  After that you should be looking at the message
in the Pine compose window.  Send it.  If ENCRYPTTOSELF=on, you can decrypt
the copy of the message in sent-mail.  If ENCRYPTTOSELF=off and you didn't
include yourself as a recipient, you might as well delete it.

The actual pgp commands/options used by mkpgp are:

pgp -sew +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF +armor=on +keepbinary=off \
+armorlines=0 +tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $keys $sign

pgp -satw +clearsig=on +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF +keepbinary=off \
+tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $sign

or

pgp -ew +encrypttoself=$ENCRYPTTOSELF +armor=on +keepbinary=off \
+armorlines=0 +tmp=$PGPPATH/tmp $1 $keys

$1 is /tmp/pico.xxxx, $keys is the list of keys, $sign is the key id used 
to sign the message.  There are several other calls to pgp to wipe and 
delete temporary files.

==========
Decryption
==========

The only way to decrypt in pine is in a reply or forward since that is your
only access to the alternate editor.  Decryption seems to work ok in a 
forward; replies are still flakey because of the variety of quote 
characters people use (I'll fix this when I have time). 

If mkpgp finds "BEGIN PGP MESSAGE" or "BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE" in the
message, it will run the command:

	pgp +force +interactive=on +keepbinary=off 

and attempt to mimic the forward/reply behavior of Pine.  

If, along the way, 

	begin 600 mkpgpAttach.tar.Z

is found in the message text, mkpgp will unpack the attachments and move 
the mkpgpAttach directory into $PGPPATH (renaming it if needed). The 
mkpgpAttach.tar.Z file is wiped & deleted. You are given a chance to
examine/delete the attachments (exiting the c-shell as before).

If mkpgp finds "BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK" mkpgp runs

	pgp +force +interactive=on +keepbinary=off

to add keys.  This only works in a forward and attachments aren't unpacked.

  (It's easy to fix, I just haven't done it yet. It was an afterthought).

Let me know how it goes.  I'm open to input, but I want to keep it simple.
Contact me again if you want the updates.

I apologize if this question has been asked many times before- I'm sure 
it has.  I'm new to the Net and would like to find out how to change the 
way my "author" name is listed when I post a message to Usenet.  Right 
now my full name is listed but I would like to change this to something else.
Would anyone be interested in giving me an easy to follow way of doing this?
Thanks!!

Indeed they do.  However, (and I don't mean to complain about what is
free software) the 22nd is the second release date that has been missed.
The previous seemingly several months back so I'm not exactly going to
hold my breath waiting.

As 3.89 seems to dump core on exit on our systems I had been waiting
for the next release before trying to fix it (as it may have been fixed
after all), but it looks like I'm going to have to fix it myself 8(.

	You can ftp source from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the pine
directory.  There are binaries available...but not for SGI.  You'll
have to compile yourself.  

	I do suggest you wait a "few more days" as the next version
of pine is due out soon.

	As David Miller said...you never believe release dates do you?

	You should check out comp.sys.solaris and observe the discussion
concerning the release of Solaris 2.4....that's even more fasinating.

	Well, I'm "89.999" percent sure they are close to a release....  ;-)
So, you've waited this long, hold on.

Subject: Bug in Pine

I just entered pine and exited after reading a couple of messages and deleting
a couple others. Instead of getting the opportunity to save already read 
messages, pine exited and I got a message that says the following:

Bug in Pine detected: "Bad msgno in mail_fetchstructure".
Exiting pine.
zsh: 12458 floating point exception (core dumped) pine -i

Yes, I use the zsh. Also, I do start pine with the -i option. I know
this is fairly obvious but....well, you know. Any ideas on what this may be?
Thanx in advance.

Hi,
	In the .pinerc file, there is an opportunity for one to
change the default internal editor for pine. I am running 3.89 on
Ultrix 4.4. I want to change this editor to emacs. I did
editor=<pathname/emacs> obviously replacing the pathname with what
it should be. I don't get emacs. I still get pico. Any ideas? TIA
Muchly.

I frequently have requests to add a list of names to other user's 
address lists.  I recall screwing things up when I simply append to 
.address files...without knowing what I'm doing.  It would be a great help
if someone could post information regarding the format of .address files, 
and a technique for appending names to an existing file.

Help!  Not for me, for my wife.  She uses pine, and she doesn't have access to a usenet feed.  She would like to get this newsgroup via a mailing list.  Could someone please help her out?  Send mail to her at:

	njg@rfc.comm.harris.com

Thanks - she is familiar with listservers, if that's required...

Pine only notifies you of new mail in the INBOX and the currently open
folder, and it does distinguish those.

I went looking for that stray character bug a while back, but didn't find it. 
It does seem to change which character gets displayed between versions...

DOS uses the TZ environment variable.  Note that the rfc822_date() function
is very OS-dependent and uses different code for different platforms...

  When I want to add/change a header to a mail (e.g., Reply-To:), I just
edit it directly.  I start the msg, Postpone it, and then edit
~/Mail/postponed-mail, insert whatever I want, and resume composing. 

Hmmmm.  I just tried it and "Reply-To" was fine, but all my X-headers got
eaten.  No help there. 

If you are asking about anonymous news posting using penet, I would just
followup as normal (To preserve the "references line" and the correct
format of the attibution) , edit the article within rn/trn, and select the
"Abort" option after exiting the editor.  At that point, trn will tell you
"a copy may temporarily be found in .article".  (Note: this is the
behavior of trn - I don't know beans 'about TIN or nn or anything else.)
So I would then

"!awk -f simple.awk < ~/.article|Rnmail -h"

The awk program would insert an apropriate "to", change the "newsgroups" 
header field to "x-anon", and whatever else you need to do.  Of course, 
you could do all this yourself in the editor....


So, I've got a kludge for Reply-To, but if I wanted to anon-post...

I added to .pinerc the line "feature-list=enable-bounce-cmd",
but all that does is to change the error message from one that
says the "B" command is "not available for this screen" to one
that says "Bounce command not implemented yet".

Is this the dead end it appears to be?

I hope this is not too much of a FAQ/RTFM --

But how do I set a one-off Reply-to: in pine? The "rich" headers don't 
seem to be very rich in this respect, and if I just put "Reply-to: ...." 
in the body of the mail, then it is not recognised as a header.

Any ideas?

(Oh and _is_ there a Pine FAQ out there?)

"sendmail-alternative=" seems like an excellent candidate for a .pinerc 
entry to me.  Don't most mail agents let the user point them to something 
besides sendmail?

There is no such opportunity.  This is taken from the default 
.pinerc file:

-----
# editor specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer.
# This is normally an alternative to Pine's internal composer (Pico)
editor=
-----

I think that explains it nicely.

Date: 24 Aug 1994 15:06:36 GMT
Message-Id: <33fnls$7nq@que.iphase.com>

One of the few things I really like about elm is its capability to
automatically look up a local user's full name given their user id and
expand the address to include their full name.  Besides being more pleasant,
it serves as a confirmation that the user name has been entered correctly.

Unfortunately, the only similar behavior I have seen in Pine is with
addresses in the addressbook.

Does anyone know a way of extending Pine to add data obtained from NIS or
the /etc/passwd file to the address line?

Thanks,

Bob

Subject: Extra mail?  Deleted mail?


We have pine 3.89 here (can't wait for 3.90....), and have been
experiencing some problems with messages.  My purpose to posting this
here is to see if any of you have experienced similar things.

Several of my users complain that after printing their message (with
the Y command using the lpr setting) the message gets deleted in their
mailbox.  For the most part this seems to happen in mailboxes that are
_NOT_ the INBOX.  

Several others have mentioned that sometimes they get "extra" copies
of messages.  I have checked the maillogs (every message gets logged
into a file) and only one message was sent, therebye leading me to
believe that this problem is related to Pine's handling of mail
connections.  

If anybody has any thoughts or pointers for tracking down this problem
please email to brianl@pubserv.com.  My experience to pine is mostly
related to installing it, as I do not use it as my primary mail-agent.
Most of my users, though, are not very experienced with UNIX,
nevermind, Pine, so I tend to think that this is due to the old
faithful crutch "operator error". :)

For the record:

	Sequent S27's
	DYNIX V3.1.2
	Pine Clients  running only on the Sequents.

                     Pine's default editor
                     ---------------------              =20

Although Pine3.89 cannot invoke the alternate editor automatically,
Pine3.90 has an "enable-alternate-editor-implicitly" feature. If this
feature, and the "editor" variable are both set, Pine will automatically
activate the specified editor when the cursor is moved from the header of
the message being composed into the message text.=20
=20
For replies, the alternate editor will be activated immediately.

So, if you would like to use a _default_ editor other than Pico, hang on
for Pine3.90 ... you won't be disappointed.

I did. It is bug ridden, though, crashed my harddisk and all, so stay with 
version 3.89 (the Pine has been forcing you anyway since Spring). I could 
have known of course, since it was on sale.

When I was trying to track it down in 3.05 oh so long ago, I would up 
just changing the definition of the top line, so the line with garbage 
would be overwritten.  I never could find where it was coming from 
either.  It went away (on SCO) in later versions.

I had a look at the pine 3.89 source while waiting for pine 3.9, and it's
trivial. For Linux built with soundcards and /dev/audio, you can
edit pine/osdep/os-lnx.ic and say "include(mimedisp.sun)" and
"include(play_snd.sun)" instead of  "include(mimedisp)" and
"include(play_snd.non)".

This then copies Audio files to /dev/audio when you ask to view an audio
attachment.

I need to know how to filter my mail into folders.  Ie: all mail from

Well, it's not a normal error.  I assume from your address that the
machine is running Ultrix?  What are your version numbers for the OS? 
What kind of hardware is it running on?  Any other identifying information
would help greatly.  I don't know of any standard compilation problems
that lead to that, but you might also want to send a friendly note to your
local technical support group, hinting that perhaps mistakes were made in
building the Pine executable there.

Currently there is no way for Pine to do the actual filtering of 
messages. You need to get 'filter' or 'procmail' and set them up to do 
the actual filtering, then change your .pinerc file to list Incoming 
Folders to place the filtered mail into.

I think pine 3.90 will have filtering built-in, but don't quote me on that.

	*DO NOT QUOTE YOU*

	Filtering is *not* the task of the MUA.  It will *not* be built-in
in 3.90.  You *must* get procmail, deliver, or filter.  

	When responding to requests try to refrain from "I think...."
answers.  Incorrect information given out as a result of this can
have far reaching effects.

	Is there an off-line PINE reader available? One that will
let me take all of my saved-messages and all that, download it to
my DOS system (non-networked), and read the letters one by one?
	I tried PC-PINE, but the version I got required that you
be linked to a network. I can read the messages as one big
text file, but I'd rather read them as individual letters, sorted,
is there a program that'll let me do this?

I  have the pine-3.89 package, and am using linux 1.1.45 with ncurses 1.8.5
The problem is that in the upper left hand corner of Pico is one

1.8.1.  I've recompiled with no effect.

Anyone seen this?

PC-Pine is getting the time and timezone information in the rfc822 "Date:"
header correct in the mail that I send.  But where does it get its
information from?  Looking at the source, I see that it uses tzset(), time(),
and localtime() to do its magic; I know how these routines work on my Unix
machine.  But where do these C routines get to know about timezones on my
MS-DOS machine?  There doesn't appear to be any way to set the timezone in DOS?

Subject: Printing Internet Items
Date: 24 Aug 1994 16:44:25 -0700
Message-Id: <33gm0p$5v@hebron.connected.com>

I have one consistent glitch in trying to print incoming messages in 
Pine, as well as newsgroup items in Tin. My printer is the HPLaserJet III.

When I use the "y" command in Pine, the printer has no trouble in 
printing the message, whether on the Input side, or from the 
Sent-messages folder. The only problem, or annoyance, is that the printer 
spits out an extra blank page.

I have the same problem with printing items from newsgroups.

For Pine I use the "y" command, or sometimes pipe (|), and ansiprt. For 
Tin I use pipe(|) and ansiprint.

I have talked to others, who don't seem to have this problem.

I would be most appreciative of any help here. It's not a big problem (I 
recycle all of the blank paper), but it is an annoyance.

Many thanks for your attention.

working perfectly.  3.90 was supposed to be released Monday.  Now, I'm not
nagging, but couldn't they at least promise us another release date?  Like
Friday, or next Friday?  I'm holding a few system enhancements until I can
get 3.90 in place, and I wonder if it's going to cost me too much time in
the end. 

Oh, well.  Anyway, 3.90 is the panacea, the cure for what ails you.  It 
does everything you ever wanted, and even makes toast.  Seriously, it's 
well worth the wait, no matter how long it gets.

No way to do that 3.89, but 3.90 does it quite well.  Now, from a user's
perspective, there might be a little confusion about which addressbook to
look at, but both are automatically searched when a nickname is entered. 
Actually, 3.90 goes one better, allowing an unlimited (or at least plural)
number of local addressbooks.  So, if I really wanted, I could keep
separate addressbooks for different purposes, all active simultaneously. 
The system addressbook is simply a special case of an addressbook, being 
read-only from Pine, no mater what the permissions on the file itself 
are.  I don't know how they've handled the [T]ake command, which 
addressbook it goes into, but that's because I haven't looked into it.

So, like everything else this week, 3.89->no, 3.90->yes.

[YAFR deleted (Yet Another Feature Request)]

Gee, with all the great enhancments and new features that I keep hearing
about in the next version, I wonder whether it would be appropriate to
call it Pine 4.0 instead of Pine 3.90.  It seems that for almost every
request for new features that I've seen on this list has been answered by,
"It'll be in 3.90." And if you don't revise the version number, what the
heck is going to happen when you DO get to 4.0?  The Super Deluxe Boy
Scout from Hell Swiss Army Knife of MUA's, I presume? 

NOTE TO THE PINE TEAM:  Don't answer this message, I'd much rather you 
spend your time getting your current project finished, which we are 
eagerly awaiting.  :-))))

NOTE TO WHINERS:  Don't bother the Pine Team.  :-))))))))

(note the big smileys)

I am new to UNIX so this may not be the best way, but it

change dir to  .tin                          cd .tin
using your text editor open a file called    Replyto

save file
now do      chmod +x ReplyTo
then do     rehash

Not sure the last two items are necessary, but it did work for me

Offline support for Pine is on our to-do list as a moderately high

Come on guys, make my day! When?

I know you said that you weren't renowned for keeping release dates,
but the guy who said 'late June', 'might slip into July', 'no reason why
August 22nd should be a problem', must have been loaded with crack
when he spoke those words.

	Keep your finger in the dike....  :-) :-)

	It is coming and it is worth the wait.  You know, this wouldn't
have happend if the Pine team wasn't striving to please as many people
as possible......and it wouldn't have happened if they kept quiet about
a release date.  Along with a few last minute bug fixes they are in the
process of providing something you don't see these days....documentation.

	But, maybe you have a point, it sure is a pain to have to wait
this long for *free* software.  :-) :-)

	Oh, BTW, I was informed that the sky would not fall should 
pine 3.90 be delayed another few _____s.

He, placing multiple smiley's after stereotype remarks about the 
Dutch doesn't help. You hurt my feelings! Although, they were very *cheap*!  
Mmmmh, ;-)

I am not blaming the Pine team anything, really. Pine is easy to use and not 
only targeted at novice users anymore. With the promised enhancements of 
3.90 it is probably the best mailer around IMHO (I have tried elm, BSD mail,
mh, mailtool among others).

It only feels bad when the highly anticipated version is delayed once 
more. I am just amazed that the Pine team agree upon approximate 
release dates (apparently, because dates have been posted here), which turn 
out to be way, way, way off.

Dear Pine team, keep up the good work.



Richard.

	Since I'm reading this on the mailing list I can't tell if
this thread has been cross posted?  I suspect it must be, since the
reply has to do with tin as opposed to pine.

One thing that has been bothering me all the time I've been using
Pine 3.89 - is that Pine is awfully slow when jumping to one 
incoming folder to another. I have set up seven incoming folders 
and each time I use [TAB] to change the folder, I get these
messages; "No more unread messages... go to another folder Y/N?"
and "Expunge deleted messages Y/N" which seem to stay on screen
forever and slow down the action.

Is there a way (maybe a variable in the source code) which affects
the time these messages stay on screen?

I'm having problems with my copy of Pine .. mail I generate has only my
hostname on the right hand side of the "@" symbol in the Message-ID
field and not my FQDN.

Can anyone suggest what it might be, pls?  hostname and domainname
return the correct values (this is under Linux, btw).

Replies via email appreciated.

Thanks,

	Hummm???

	I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you....but you seem to
have missed the point.  The "one day sale" was a "joke".  

	I hate it when people take me seriously....I never do.

P.S.	3.90 is due out shortly....

Does anyone else have a problem printing mail from Pine using the 'Y' 
command? I am using WinCommPro. I can print using its commands but it's a 
pain. The 'Y' command flashes through the mail giving all indications 
that it's working but nothing prints. Any ideas?

I am also having a problem printing Pine messages to my HP Printer -- it's

I found the solution to this.  Apparently it happens under MS-DOS (as well as
Linux), because there is code in display.c that handles this little bug.  What
you need to do is add LINUX to the #if statement on line 916 of the display.c
file, and recompile.  The fixed line should look something like this:
			
			#if MSDOS || LINUX

That should do it.  Everyone who runs Pico on Linux say YEHHHHHH!!! ;-)

Well.

I got one reply to my question (which I feel must be a FAQ) which was 
"how does one filter messages into separate mailboxes?"

The gentleman told me to use elm's filter; unfortunately the elm filter 
program blows up and spews all over the place when I try to compile it 
under Solaris 2.4 beta on this box.  Agh.

Any other ideas?

Marko,
Unfortunately, the delays are not artifacts of the message display
routine.  In 3.90 you will be able to set a feature to avoid the
confirmation prompt when TABing between folders (you can do that already
for eXpunge on quitting), but the real improvement will have to wait for
Pine 4.0, which will implement many of the new features in the IMAP4 spec. 
In particular, IMAP4 specifies an efficient way for Pine to ask the mail
server which folders have new/recent messages in them, and also has a new
primitive to allow closing a folder much more quickly.  (Right now Pine has
to actually open the next incoming folder to see if there are any recent
messages.)

Well, the UNIX version of pine uses plain text files as folders.  So, printing the entire contents of a folder is as easy as printing the file (i.e. lpr).

Subject: Pico line wrap concatenates
Date: 26 Aug 1994 17:54:35 GMT
Message-Id: <33la8r$6ef@tokyo.engr.sgi.com>


-- 
I am using Pico as an editor off of a forms application with TERM=vt100
and running in character mode.  When I execute pico directly from the
command line all is well.

But when I run pico from within the application I have a problem with
line wrap concatenating with the next line.

For instance:
Given:
	axbc
	gpq

If I start typing after "c" I get:
	axbc this is a test of pico line
	wrapgpq

Rather than:
	axbc this is a test of pico line
	wrap
	gpq

I get the same result if I set my TERM to iris-ansi and ansi.
Any help would be appreciated.

Joseph,

English isn't your first language is it?  the phrase "pulling one's
leg" refers to making a joke.  Ed was making reference to this phrase
above.

I suppose that the original "one day sale" joke must have enough
cultural references in it that it didn't translate any more than the
leg pulling comment did.  (You probably didn't get my earlier comment
about ducking and the joke going over your head either.  When a "joke
goes over someone's head" it means that they not only didn't get the
joke, but they didn't even realize that it was a joke.)

This is where cross-cultural and multi-national networking gets
interesting.

Gee, did I just have a conversation with Star Trek's Data?

Cheers,
Chris

16:01:29 -0500) and pico seems to work fine and does *not* display garbage

pico    ftp://ftp.fammed.washington.edu/pub/pico.gz   (52045)

This may seem like a silly question, but what's so darn inappropriate 
about having a useful mail-handling feature like filtering mail in a 
mail-handling application?  Is this an actual impropriety or just another 
custom thing like not having word-wrap in unix editors?

Yes, I see it too.  On my system it manifests itself as a reverse-video 
comma.  It doesn't affect anything though, so I haven't worried about it.

Pine3.90 will not have inbuilt filtering, but you will be able to setup a 
number of folders for "incoming mail". Incoming mail folders can be local 
or remote (IMAP) folders.

Pine3.90 has several new features including "Select" (to select a
collection of messages in a folder based on criteria such as 'Subject',
'From', 'Date', etc.), to which you will be able to "Apply" one of Pine's
message manipulation commands; for example 'Delete','Print', and perhaps
most useful in this case 'Save'. 

So, although pine3.90 will not have filtering capability for incoming 
mail (it's not appropriate anyway), you will be able to manually organise 
your messages very quickly the following way:

1.  Open you INBOX in the usual way.
2.  Use the 'Select' command.
    - enter selection criteria; possibly 'Subject'?
    - type in the subject that you want to 'match' on.
    (at this point Pine3.90 highlights those messages that match your 
    selection criteria).
3.  Use the 'Apply' command.
    -  select the 'Save' option, and enter the appropriate folder name.
4.  eXpunge the saved (and marked for deletion if Pine3.90 is configured 
    to do so) messages from your INBOX.

Of all the improvements and fixes in Pine3.90, I think the aggregate
operation commands (Select, Apply, Zoom), will be widely used, and become
very popular with Pine3.90 users.

Bzzzzzt!  Filtering will not be in 3.90, nor is it currently planned for any

Our users here do not have access to the shell. Does anyone know how they 
could activate the 'vacation' setting in UNIX to indicate to people that 
they are on vacation?

Our in-house mailing system does it and it would be nice if they could 
set it at the UNIX level as well.

For the record we are using DG/UX 5.4.2 and Pine 3.86. TIA

  This is what I do (it's a lot easier when I have two telnet windows open):
Postpone your message while composing, edit ~/Mail/postponed-mail and 
manually insert a "Reply-To:".  Resume composing.

Brian, I'll comment on the part of your message that looks familiar to me...

Have you checked syslog? This is where multiple mailings will show up.

I have also had/have this problem (multiple copies), and know what the
cause is on Sequent's DYNIX/ptx. This problem may or may not be the same
as the one you are experiencing. The problem is caused by orphaned mail 
.lock files.

/bin/mail and mailbox locking
-----------------------------
Sequent's implementation of the "mail" program (the program that actually
delivers mail messages to /usr/mail (/usr/spool/mail on DYNIX 3.1.2?) does
not handle mailings very well to more than one person (multiple names in
To: CC: or Bcc:) *if* one of the destination usernames has a .lock file
existing when /bin/mail tries to write to that person's mailbox. 

A typical sequence of events is:

+  A mail .lock file becomes orphaned (for example after a user crashes 
   Elm2.3).
+  Another local user uses Pine (or Elm, or any other mailer), to mail a 
   message to one than one user on the local computer (including the user 
   with the .lock file).
+  sendmail "collects" the message from Pine (or another mailer), and 
   "hands over" the messages to "mail" if the messages are destined for 
   the local computer.
+  mail successfully writes the message into the mail files (in /usr/mail 
   or /usr/spool/mail) for all users up to the user who has a .lock file.
+  sendmail thinks the entire delivery has failed, and therefore puts the 
   entire recipient list and message text into the mailqueue.
+  sendmail then reprocesses the entire message again (15mins or so 
   later, depending on how often sendmail is configured to process its 
   queue. For example, "/usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q15m".
+  The entire loop starts again.

Which leads to:

+  The user with the .lock file not getting the message, until the .lock 
   file is removed.
+  All users in the list *prior* to the user with the .lock file getting 
   several copies.
+  All users *after* the user with the .lock file not getting the message 
   at all.

If this happens, I check for orphaned lock files by doing: "ls -l
/usr/mail/*.lock", and delete any lock files that are orphans, but *not*
those that are _really_ being used! 

Then, I either manually delete the repeated files from the mail queue
spool area (use /usr/lib/mailq to check, and only do this if you know
exactly what you are doing), or clear the sendmail queue with
"/usr/lib/sendmail -q" (or wait 15mins). 

Sequent know that /bin/mail has lots of bugs (not just the one I've 
mentioned) but it's not a high priority for fixes.

The ideal behaviour in the case of orphaned .lock files would be for 
sendmail and mail to work cooperatively along the lines of "10 out of 12 
users can recieve the mail (no .lock file), so deliver the 10, and only 
put the remaining two recipients in the mail queue".

Finally, on one occassion, several users recieved 76 copies of a message, 
until the offending lock file (caused by an Elm2.3 crash) was removed.

I think the moral of this (lengthy?) story is, that the moment a user 
complains about getting several copies of a message, check for .lock 
files belong to all of the recipients and zap them if not genuine.

Hi,

I am trying to install pine in our corporation. We are facing a couple 
of problems in the Imapd setup.

A. We are not able to setup Imapd to utilise the .rhosts file entries 
   in a way similar to rsh. We have made an entry linking /etc/rimapd
   to /usr/sbin/imapd ( this is the absolute path to imapd ). Is any 
   entry to be made in /etc/services and/or /etc/inetd.conf for rimapd.
   As of now there is no such entry. We are having SVR4 and SVR3
   machines.

B. PC-Pine ( for PCTCP ) is able to store and poll the imapd server 
   with the stored password in PINE.PWD file, but expects the password
   to be the same on all machines.

C. Is there any way PC-Pine can access Imapd servers on different 
   machines with differnt login ids with stored entries in PINE.PWD
   file. This PC-Pine is the executable directly downloaded from

Blain,

	It is inappropriate to place this task with a UA. 

	Think of it this way.  Your UA is not active at all times.  When
you invoke pine you generally look to one place, the inbox, where the
MTA has deposited your incoming mail.  Now the only time the UA could
sort and xfer your incoming mail into the designated folders would be on
start-up.  If you have a lot of email in your inbox the start-up time
could be excessive.  Then, think of what would need to be done when new
mail arrives while you are reading your inbox....the same sort of time
consuming tasks will need to be performed along with associated locking
problems.

	Your MTA is working for you 24hrs a day.  It is best suited to
take care of delivery of email to its designated spot.  Think of it as
the PO sorting the incoming email into individual boxes.  It is better
than the PO handing your a stack of letters and you having to sort them
before getting down to the business of reading...

	Regards,

		Ed

I remember an older version of Pine supported differentiation between
dial-up and direct terminals, setting the cursor in the (I)ndex of current
folder from "highlighting" to just a plain ">" in front of each message.

I can't seem to get this to work anymore in 3.89... Is this still possible?
How does one do it?

X-To:       Pine Announcement Distribution <pine-announce@cac.washington.edu>

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 3.90.  This release, though perhaps not immediately obvious from
the version number, represents a notable step forward in functionality. 
Feature highlights include: 

      o  Configuration Screen
      o  Aggregate operations
      o  News posting
      o  News subscription/unsubscription.
      o  Multiple address books
      o  Multiple postponed messages
      o  A *preliminary* version of Pine's character interface
         ported to Windows-3.1/Winsock

A detailed list of additional features can be found in Pine's builtin
release notes ("R" on the Main Menu).  Even more information can be found
via: 

    o  The anonymous FTP archives at ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
    o  The World-Wide-Web page at http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

As is sometimes the case, a hefty step forward can increase the chance of
tripping.  We are cautiously optimistic that this version is relatively
stable, but it would be a good idea to expose it to at least some rigorous
testing before unleashing it in a production environment. 

Pine version 3.90 is available via anonymous ftp to ftp.cac.washington.edu
from the file named "pine/pine.tar.Z".  Pre-compiled executables for
various flavors of UNIX can be found in the "pine/unix-bin" directory, and
zip'd copies of the DOS and Windows releases can be found in the
"pine/pcpine" directory. 

As always, our thanks to the countless people who have taken the time to
provide valuable feedback and bug reports! 

The Pine Team

ALL of the UNIX editors I use do word wrap: JOVE, Joe, pico, jed, GNU EMACS.
I have spent less than a total of 2 hours of time in vi in over 9 years of
heavy UNIX use.

No, entries for rimapd are not required.  The best way to test rimapd is to
"rsh host /etc/rimapd".  Any problems are usually readily apparent...

Maybe because it's a mail thing and Pine handles mail.  Maybe because 
having access to Pine does not guarantee access to filtering otherwise.  
Maybe because ELM does it and Pine is Nearly Elm.  Maybe because I've 
seen posts here approximately weekly asking for the feature.

To take a lead from David....

Bzzzzzzzztttt.....  *Wrong*  ELM does *not* filter.  It includes in its
distribution an additional utility called "filter".  If that is what you
want....then say it.

Just because you've seen posts about it...doesn't make it a viable feature.

Because it is a User Agent and *not* a Transport Agent.  There are 
distictions.

Seems you didn't get my email I'd sent you....let me post it for you..


	It is inappropriate to place this task with a UA. 

	Think of it this way.  Your UA is not active at all times.  When
you invoke pine you generally look to one place, the inbox, where the
MTA has deposited your incoming mail.  Now the only time the UA could
sort and xfer your incoming mail into the designated folders would be on
start-up.  If you have a lot of email in your inbox the start-up time
could be excessive.  Then, think of what would need to be done when new
mail arrives while you are reading your inbox....the same sort of time
consuming tasks will need to be performed along with associated locking
problems.

	Your MTA is working for you 24hrs a day.  It is best suited to
take care of delivery of email to its designated spot.  Think of it as
the PO sorting the incoming email into individual boxes.  It is better
than the PO handing your a stack of letters and you having to sort them
before getting down to the business of reading...

 A couple of days ago, somebody had asked how, after sorting
their mail into different folders, they could be notified 
about unread messages.  I have been writing a little shell
script to do this.  One thing I noted is that the folder 'Inbox'
did not exist in the Mail directory.  Does anyone know where
the Inbox folder (file) is located?

Hi, me again,

This time it is for real. I compiled Pine version 3.90 without any
problems on a SparcStation running SunOS 4.1.3.
I have used it for the past 2 hours or so and immediately made great use 
of the new customized header feature for someone else who really, really 
needed this.

BTW The Pine team didn't mention much about the new setup/configure 
screen, but with all the options there with context sensitive help it is 
a very good improvement.

Next thing I am going to test is the improved MIME compatibility using 
the 'mailcap' file.

The Pine team did a great job! Since they reserved version number 4.0
for compatibility release with IMAP 4, they could not go higher than that. 
But as far as I am concerned they at least could have called it 3.99 or 
so. 


Thanks!!


Richard.

PS The Pine team does advice you to keep your 3.89 binary around in case
a nasty bug crops up in the new code. I went cold turkey, but you may 
prefer to be more careful.

I think the problem can be defined this way:

Geographic proximity to Redmond WA.

(seriously tho, I'd rather it be a little later if it's a little more bug-

In the current Pine 3.90 release, you can go to the Setup/Configuration
screen and set the assume-slow-link feature.  Older versions of Pine would
use slow-speed mode if the line speed was set below 4800bps (e.g. by stty
1200).

The logical place to handle filtering is during the delivery process.  Since
Pine is not involved with the delivery process, why would it be involved with
filtering?

For those of you not on the mailing list, Pine 3.90 is available.  I just 
finished downloading and compiling it and the new features are really great.
I think most of us who have been eagerly awaiting it's arrival will be 
quite pleased with it.

Has anyone compiled Pine/Pico for SCO ODT/Unix yet, and is the binaries 
available anywhere?

Thanks in advance.

I was tempted to answer this yesterday, but didn't dare since the answer
would have been yet another "It's fixed in 3.90" But now that 3.90 is out:
in 3.90 passwds are associated with specific hosts, and Pine will keep
track of more than one, both in memory and in the pine.pwd file.

Being able to associate a different login ID with different IMAP servers
is on the semi-short list for a future release.

Pine 3.90 will allow you to configure and set the appropriate headers (see
customized-hdrs in the Config screen).  The delivery receipt is a function of
the MTA and is supported differently in different agents.  Pine does not and
will not automatically generate read-receipts for various privacy and legal
reasons.

    This is an announcement that there is an unofficial mirror
for Pine release 3.90 for the convenience of users in the Czech
and Slovak Republics at either
ftp.vszbr.cz:/pub/mail/pine
ccsun.tuke.sk:/pub
Users outside CZ or SK in Europe may find it faster to retrieve
the program from ftp.cac.washington.edu, which is the official
release site, however, this unofficial mirror is provided for the
benefit of users in CZ and SK so they need not transfer the whole
program over an international link.

Hi gang !

I'd been trying to compile pine under solaris 2.3 without succes so
far.
I have gcc as a compiler.
I changed my CC variables to gcc.

When I compile pine, I just can compile two biniries mtest and imaped.
When pico and pine start to be compiled I get an error code -1 , it
dosent found some DPOSIX stuff  and usr/ucb/lib stuff

Any work around tu compile pine onder solaris 2.3  with gcc?


thanks in advance and have a good day

I'm sure pine could be modified to be a local delivery agent.  But why
bother, when existing programs (like /bin/mail) already do that?

Also, local delivery agents usually have to run with special
privileges -- /bin/mail is setuid root (or setgid mail).  Making pine
setuid root would not be a good idea!

ELM does *not* do filtering.  The "filter" program in the ELM distribution is
a completely independent application that works just as well with Pine.

Not in the legal sense, but in practical terms, yes.

There was a slight problem I was having with Pine 3.89.
I hoped it would go away with 3.90, but the same problem
goes on: I cannot set saved-msg-name-rule to anything
other than by-from and default-folder. I can set them in
3.90 with the configuration screen and they work fine in
that session. But when I quit and begin a new session Pine
changes the setting back to by-from if it wasn't already
by-from or default-folder. I there something I am missing?

I use Pine on a Sun4. Does anybody else has the same problem?

Is there a way to set 'read-receipt' and 'delivery-receipt' in Pine?

This feature sends a message back if the recipient has read or received the
message (if the remote mailer supports this feature of course).

Thanks,

Date: 27 Aug 94 19:29:16 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.778015756@gmi.edu>

I am running the new pine on SunOS 4.1.3.  The new features that I have
tried are really nice.

If I were to simply replace the system-wide pine 3.89 binary, would my users
notice any difference?  Is the new pico any different at all?  I do not
answer the trouble calls at our site and I do not want to surprise/confuse
any of the users.

Date: 27 Aug 94 19:40:46 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.778016446@gmi.edu>

I am running the new pine on SunOS 4.1.3 on a machine that has previously
been running 3.89.  I have only changed my own .pinerc file.  When I start
the new binary I get a status message at the bottom of the opening screen to
the effect of "Bad Context: unmatched '}' : (something else)".

Is this probably being provoked by something in my old system-wide rc file?
If not, any other ideas?

How did you get it going ? I have spent three hours without any result. 
Typing "build lnx" (for Linux) only results in a message "can't find specfile lnx".
I could compile pico and imap individually, but no such luck with pine.

One of the four authoritative name servers for cac.washington.edu has 
stale data which, unfortunately, doesn't know about the hostname 
docserver.  If you are unlucky enough to ask that name server it will 
tell you there is no such host.  We've removed that server from the list 
of authoritative server and are trying to get that server's date updated, 
so this shouldn't happen to too many more people.  Sorry about the 
inconvenience.

use-alternate-editor-implicitly is the greatest thing since grocery stores!
No more confusion over which editor I am in.

One problem:  when I started it up it asked if I wanted "Hints".  I told it
yes, but the machine it mailed to was unavailable.  The returned message

Message-Id: <Pine.SCO.3.90.940827173455.16879C-100000@ssi.edc.org>

I have compiled the Pine 3.90 distribution for SCO Unix (SYSVr3.2v4.2, 
with Dev/Sys and TCP/IP 1.2.1), and am making it available through the 
anonymous FTP archives on soils.agron.iastate.edu.  It should be noted 
that Pine 3.90 builds "out of the box" for SCO, with no modifications 
necessary whatsoever on my system.  The only change I made was to turn 
off the DEBUG flag.

I have just uploaded a single tar file with all the Pine 3.90 binaries and
man pages included in it, to the directory /pub/incoming, on the machine
soils.agron.iastate.edu.  It should be moved soon to /pub/sco/unix/pine. 
The file name is pine3.90.dist.sco.tar.gz1, and it should probably be
renamed to plain .gz when it gets moved.  You should definitely change the
name when you download it.  There is also a pine3.90.dist.sco.tar.gz which
is only half as large, and was interrupted in transmission.  Please ignore
that one. 

The source to this package is freely available from anonymous FTP from 
ftp.cac.washington.edc, and compiles without modification on SCO Unix 
systems.

The tar file has a README in it.  However, if anyone's curious, the files 
contained therein are:

pine3.90/
README.builder		Info about me and this little distribution
README.dist
README.imap
README.pine		The three README files from the Pine3.90 source
brochure.txt		Pine overview from the doc/ directory of source

pine3.90/bin:
imapd			The IMAP2 daemon
ipop2d			POP2 daemon
ipop3d			POP3 daemon
mtest			Mail routines test program
pico			Pico (Pine Composer) binary
pine			Pine 3.90 binary

On further inspection, it seems that the "docserver.cac.washington.edu"
CNAME was recently added (apparently sometime on 27 August) and hadn't
yet propagated to many of the secondary nameservers.  In fact,
june.cs.washington.edu is still carrying zone data 20 July, and
ns.unet.umn.edu has data from 25 August.

So anyway, it may be a few hours or days until things stabalize
for everyone.

How do I make "build" command work ? I read all the documents, but whenever

Is it a general problem or specific to linux ? Or, do I need to do anything

I would appreciate any help.

There is now a patchfile for NetBSD 0.9A and 1.0A that has had
*limited* testing (eg: this is the first news posting using it).

Date: Thu, 25 Aug 1994 16:12:36 GMT

I solved my problem.  This message may be of use to others.

PC-Pine is always getting the "Date:" field timezone information correct in
any mail we send.  We had never set the DOS TZ variable and it was not
obvious where the timezone information was coming from.

The only reason we pursued this is because we once had a problem with ECSMail
for Windows getting the timezone wrong once in a while and wanted to make
sure that affliction would not affect Pine.  In that case, we also never
figured out where ECSMail was getting the timezone information from and hence
we didn't know why it was randomly wrong.  ISA told us that there was a DOS
or Windows system call for setting and getting the timezone, and that is
where ECSMail was getting it from.  The default timezone for MS-DOS, if its
not set, is Pacific Standard Time/Pacific Daylight Time (i.e. the correct
timezone for the Microsoft headquarters); so what software was setting it to
Eastern time, which is appropriate for Toronto where I am?  (ISA fixed the
problem by providing Windows ECSMail with a timezone configuration option
which overrides the internal system timezone.)

This morning we finally figured it out.  The date, time, and most important,
the timezone are set by logging into our Novell Netware server.  (A standard
part of configurating a Netware server is telling it the timezone its in.)
When we rebooted a PC, explicitly did not login to out Novell Netware server,
and tried sending messages from Pine--it used Pacific Daylight Time.  (Both
the sendmail and zmailer SMTP servers will change the "Date:" *timezone* so
it is the local one, by changing the *time*.  As a result, the symptom users
will see is that the *time*, not *timezone*, is wrong.)

The moral of the story, as David Miller correctly says, is you should set the
DOS TZ environment variable to explicitly give the timezone.  (With ECSMail,
ISA now provides a number of alternative ways to specify the timezone.  For
Macintosh packages, the situation is different; packages such as Mailstorm
and Eudora use the "Map" control panel which unfortunately is half baked--the
MacOS understands timezones, but not the concept of daylight saving time.)

We'll make sure this gets fixed in the first bug-fix release after 3.90.

It wasn't actually that bad.  The docserver CNAME was added August 3rd 
(hey, we even tested it!).  The part about june carrying stale data is 
correct and was the problem.  Everything should be working smoothly now.

Message-Id: <33pa53$bib@news.nynexst.com>

The new release of pine 3.90 has been ported to A/UX.  Both the source
and binaries have been uploaded to jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov and should be
available soon (right Jim ;-)  

The binaries were created on A/UX 3.1 using gcc 2.5.7a.  The source     
should compile on earlier versions of A/UX (I haven't tested this).

This release has some slick enhancements, good going guys!

The 'garbage' character associated with pico under linux is
still there, but fixable.  The pine team may wish to incorporate
the fix in future releases.

Change #if MSDOS to #if MSDOS || LINUX in ~pico/display.c

I just installed pine 3.90, it is very nice.  my return mail address
shows sfrazier@infinet.com vs. sfrazier@eng.infinet.com.  I changed my
domain name in the setup but it didn't matter, can someone point me in 
the right direction on how to get eng.infinet.com there vs just infinet.com

Thanks.

	The help menu says:

This value specifies the domain part (right-hand side) of your return
address on outgoing email and is also used as the default domain for email
composed to a local user.  If unset, Unix Pine will obtain the domain from
the system.  Often this value will be set for your whole site by the
system administrator.

	It is a bit confusing...but it means the FQDN or the entire
right-hand side...including the hostname.  Then, to get pine to lookup
in the passwd file you may also want to set:

	user-lookup-even-if-domain-mismatch

I've been using the new 3.90 version for two days now and really like
it. There are, however, some problems with the post-to-newsgroup 
feature. I tried to post to an existing local test group but got
an error message: Error 441 Can't parse "Date" header !!! Any idea
about what's wrong???

The hints file says you can recompile, which was also true of 3.89.  With
all the other things that can be set in the rc files, it would seem nearly
trivial to have this as a settable option.  If it already is and I missed
it, forgive me.

Try running pine with a '-d0' switch.

	You can start pine with "pine -d 0" or you can recompile without
the -DDEBUG option.  I believe you will have to take it out of the
individual makefile for the platform you are building

Is this what I read what I think it is? A default "build" for MiNT to ATARI?

Well I must say that MiNT really starts showing up with the BIG boys, 
UNIX, Solaris and so on....


mnt:  # Mint
        $(MAKE) mtest OS=$@ EXTRADRIVERS="$(EXTRADRIVERS)" \
                STDPROTO=bezerkproto \
                CFLAGS="-O -I. -I/mac/h -I/mac/h-tcp $(EXTRACFLAGS)" \
                CC=gcc ARRC="gcc-ar rc" RANLIB=true \
                LDFLAGS="-L/mac/lib /mac/lib-tcp/dnr.o -llibmac -llibmac 


This is to good to be true!

A happy MiNT user:	Robert

Subject: Pine 3.90--Need wattcp.cfg file?
Date: Sun, 28 Aug 1994 12:32:38
Message-Id: <elias.5.000C8B9D@umich.edu>

I am a relative beginner (so requesting patience, etc.). I have used PC-Pine 
3.89 successfully and downloaded PC-Pine 3.90 (for use with DOS). It doesn't 
recognize that I have TCP working, and the setup information refers to the 
need to configure a wattcp.cfg file. But this file did not come with my 
download. Where can I get it, with instructions? Or if I just need to create a 
text file with one line, what information  needs to be in that line?

With PC-Pine 3.89, I used a batch file created by my university which  
installed kerbmem and presumably some other stuff. Since it may be some time 
before the university folks help with 3.90, I'm wondering if I can get it 
working with that wattcp.cfg file (and the set variable mentioned in the setup 
instructions).

Any help with this would be appreciated.

If I attach a binary file, do I need to tell pine that it's a binary file

You've got a chicken-and-egg problem there!  The .pine-debug-file needs to be
open when you read the config files so problems can be logged. Just set up
Pine as an alias to "pine -d0", then you can go back and turn the .pine-debug
files on when you need them.

For a default configuration, the differences are minimal.  Both 3.89 and 3.90
have the "-p pinerc" command line option, so you can compare them using the
same .pinerc file without changing your own config...

I get to Internet through a server that has Pine (along with Pico) I find 
it excellent. However, I can only use it while on-line to my server. It's
a free phone call, and a flat rate, but it does tie up the phone. Can I
load Pine on m,y PC at home and do all my reading and composing off-line?

The "fix" came in too late for us to evaluate for 3.90.  We'll take a

Pine uses BASE64 encoding on all attachments, so being a binary file is not a
problem.  It does recognize a few binary file types and tag them accordingly
(e.g. image/gif, text/postscript, etc).

After making a backup of my 3.89 binary (Just In Case) I went ahead and 
replaced it with 3.90.  The users will see a splash screen saying, 
"Welcome to the new version" and be asked if they want the "Secrets of 
Pine" document via mail.  After that they'll see no substantial changes 
unless they go looking for them.  The user interface hasn't changed much 
at all.  And I haven't noticed any changes whatsoever in Pico.

If your users are real serious computerphobes they *might* get miffed by 
the slightly different way 3.90 displays attachments, but that's the 
biggest user-interface difference I've seen so far.  (Mind you, I don't 
use Pine for news; just mail.)

I'm afraid I don't understand your question.  Your users don't have 
access to the shell, but you want to start 'vacation' at the Unix level?
What are you calling "the Unix level" if it's not a shell prompt?

I built it under Linux with "build lnx" and had no problems at all.  Is 
the current directory in your path?  Maybe you're actually getting a 
different "build" program than the one that comes with Pine.  Try...

  ./build lnx

...instead to force it to use the "build" script located in the current 
directory. 

If this still doesn't work, I reckon you've somehow got a bad 
distribution.  Try to get a fresh copy from the archive site.

BTW, let me add my comments that that new config screen is just about the 
greatest thing since sliced bread!

Could some kind soul please help me? I was compiling pine 3.90 on our 
system and received the following error during c-client compilation:

   tcp_unix.c: In function 'tcp_open':
   In file included from os_d-g.c:58:
   tcp_unix.c:73: incompatible type in assignment
   Fatal error in /usr/lib/gcc/cc1
   Exit status 041

I went into tcp_unix and found this at line 73+:

    if ((sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr (hostname)) != -1) {
      sin.sin_family = AF_INET;	/* family is always Internet */
      strcpy (hostname,host);	/* hostname is user's argument */

I seem to remember something about the sin.sin_addr.s_addr from before 
when I first tried to get pine. Does anyone know what the problem might 
be? It looks like this failure caused a complete installation failure as 
well. Any help would be greatly apprciated. TIA

I actually read your question rather differently then did some of the other
people who replied.  I assumed you were talking about it from a user
interface point of view.  As far as the user is concerned pine is their tool
set for dealing with mail.  Specifying dynamic message selectiona and action
(e.g. like pine3.90 select & apply commands) or automatic message selection
and action (e.g. from now on select all messages meeting the following
criteria and apply the following commands ...) naturally fall into the tool
the user sees.  So I should be able to say, from now on all messages from
"n9348795@gonzo.cc.wwu.edu" should be filed in my "Blain" folder.

I think the other people who replied were telling you where the code to
implement this would reside most naturally in a client-server environment.
Of course, as a user of pine I don't care which of the server (post office)
or client (pine) implements a particular action; all I care about is how easy
it is for me to figure out how to use a feature.  I think it would be
simplier for users if mail filtering was indeed done in the pine user
interface; For someone who uses PC-Pine, has never seen UNIX, and has no
login access to the post office telling them to use "filter" from the elm
distribution is like telling them to dance on the moon.

I'm using Pine 3.90 under Linux.

I have set "received" as my default read-message-folder and enabled the 
auto-save-read-msg feature.  But when I quit Pine, the read messages are 
still residing in INBOX and marked as unread.

Anybody has the same problem?

Regards.

Subject: probs reading MH folder (and can I write in MH format? (+more??))
Date: 28 Aug 1994 16:35:17 GMT
Message-Id: <33qec5$csd@news.doit.wisc.edu>

Pine team,
Congratulations on a job well done (and for a release within a week of 
projected date! -- must be new record for free software). Now that I'm
done with the praise bit, here come the peeves :-) 

[btw, the new-users love 3.90 even more than 3.89, esp with the great new
setup config screen]

One of my major motivation for checking out Pine was it's ability to read
MH folders via IMAPD, bug I've been getting some weird results. 

Platform: (all using pre-compiled binaries from ftp.cac....)
    client: Pine 3.90 SPARC 10/41 SunOS4.1.3
    IMAP server: IMAP 3.4 SPARC LX Solaris2.2 (running under inetd)
    MH version: 6.8 #4
    
Problem:
    When I `go-to-folder' using {mailhome}#mh/archive/simulation (which 
    happens to have 1441 articles (I use qt to index articles, so I never 
    bothered to sub-folder these archives), I get the same article/msg 
    repeated many many times; eg., the 1st 50 message I get are really 
    repeats of msg #1, 2nd 50 messages repeats of msg#2, etc.

    Am I the only one seeing this? I'll experiment some more today with
    smaller folders to see if it's the size of the folders.

Q1. MH Folder view:
    Can I configure Pine client to see ALL my MH folders (sort of like
    Xmh) without having to manually specify each of my hundreds of
    folders in .pinerc?

Q2. Writing MH folders:
    Can I save messages to my mailhome via IMAPD in MH format? (it
    probably already works -- after my MH folder reading problem, I just
    didn't dare try this)

Q3. PC-Pine setup:
    Here we use a PC Mail program bundled with DEC PATHWORKS that uses
    MH on our DEC/Ultrix server, which has a very useful opening dialog
    asking for HOST/USER/PASSWORD right up front (great for student labs
    and shared machines). Any way of setting up PC-Pine so that when
    it starts up, it'l do something similar?

thanks in advance
mumit

I did a quick topic search of debug, and didn't find anything, so I appologize
if this is in a FAQ or something.

Why does pine always create .pine-debug1 and .pine-debug2????

I really don't want these files, i know they aren't exactly big, but its
annoying to see them around...(like I don't have enough clutter files as it
is).

I had to rebuild 3.89 with termcap to eliminate the screen locking

I defined a new header (Priority:) and tried sending a message to myself
with message priority set to Urgent. However, in the message list there's
nothing to indicate the message priority. I know that this is not a 
feature for every-day use but very handy anyway (it is found in Elm).
Are you planning on adding that to the source code in the future?

	This is kind of off the subject of pine but it still 
deals with mail and I figures it's more interesting then all the
unsubscribe messages this group gets. :)

In any case how do I use a .forward file to pipe my mail to a 
process?

For those of you who are going to tell me to look in the man pages
I have.  There is no .forward.5 or forward.5 on my system.  I've
also looked at mail and sendmail.

Thanks,

I unzipped the version for the PC (as opposed to Sun, Windows, etc.). The 
file on setup REFERS to the need for a watcp.cfg file which it implies comes 
with the "distribution" of the program. My question is: where do I get this 
file and the documentation needed to set it up?

Did anyone else find a need for this?

Thanks to the Pine team for all the nice enhancements.  Just one minor 
detail - there is some mention of a sample mailcap file.  I can't seem to 
find this, am I just blind?

Not only is it not a feature for every-day use....I could not find it
in the standards.  If it is not in the standards then I hope they don't
plan on adding support for it.

	With the pine distribution they should have, IMHO, included as part
of the documentation the RFC that deals with mailcap.  I've included
that RFC as an attachment.

^W (whereis) ==> ^Y (top) && ^V (bottom). Was this feature in 3.89 as well?

Sorry, for us "the Unix level" is just that, Unix. Our system runs 
PI/Open and Blacksmith, an operating system emulator and delvelopment 
system, respectively. The users login and are immediately sent to the 
PI/Open level. This is kind of like having DOS and Windows on your hard 
drive and having you system boot to Windows immediately.

At any rate, our users do not see the Unix prompts, ever. The closest 
they get is Pine. Running Pine from PI/Open is akin to running a DOS 
session from Windows. Actually, you've just gotten me thinking....Hmm. 
Give me a day or two.

    Simply put the pipe char (|) at the top of the file followed by
    the name of the command to filter the mail through.  e.g.

| /usr/local/bin/filter

Is it possible to attach a tiff file like a fax and then be able to view
it via pine?

  Am now using Pine 3.90, and found something in the newsgroup section.  
It seems, that when I go through all the newsgroups (with tab) and read 
all the messages, exit pine, go back later, all the news items I had 
already read, are there again.  Anyway I can get it so it will only have 
the ones I haven't read??

You are NOT yet upgraded to DG/UX 5.4R3.00, are you?  The prototype for
that function was not "standard" in earlier releases. They fixed it in R3.00.
You'll have to correct the prototype in the header file, or kludge on
into the os header file just to get you by until you upgrade.

BTW, I have DG/UX 5.4R3.00 and just did a "build d-g" and it complied 
perfectly. In fact, am using it now to post!

Scenario:

Am reading a news group. I want to goto another one. Press "G" to goto
another folder/newsgroup. The "collection" I am in is my first mail 
collection.  I then have to hit ^N to skip down to news collection before 
typing in the new group name.

If it could "stick" to your current collection when using "G", it'd be 
helpful.

Oh, btw, this release is AWESOME!!!!   Worth the wait!   And thanks for
the d-g support. Complied flawlessly, runs perfectly (so far, at least!)

Got one!

Bug in Pine detected: "Bad msgno in mail_fetchheader".
Exiting pine.
ABORT instruction

Do the following. Enter a folder or a newsgroup. Delete everything, then 
X it so the folder is now empty (or excludes everything).

Press ? for help, it asks if you want to include current message, press Y 
and the above error happens.

Obviously because there is no message to include, but surely a more 
graceful way of handling it must be possible! :-)

Anyway, a nitpick. I am definitely a happy camper. Been waiting months 
for two pieces of software to be released and I get them both in the same 
weekend, Pine 3.90 *AND* Road Rash for my 3DO.  I just can't decide which
to play with now!

	Is there a way to quote a letter using PINE and have
your .sig come out at the bottom of the letter, instead of
the top?

Did you read the readme file that tells you to use config.tel if you are
using ncsa telnet with packet drivers?

Subject: [Q] How to unselect?
Date: 29 Aug 94 02:29:06 GMT
Message-Id: <ellis.778127346@gmi.edu>

Sunos 4.1.3.

I am really enjoying the new features.  Just started playing with select and
apply.  After selecting a bunch of messages and saving them to a new folder,
I wanted to select a different bunch of messages and save them to a
pre-existing folder.  I could not figure out how to unselect the first group
without expunging.  Select and zoom might be the neatest feature except for
the implicit editor, but if I cannot figure how to unselect articles, this
will be less useful than it might be.

Pointers appreciated.

	Well, after you have saved them...or did whatever you want to them
all you have to do is ";" (Select) again and you will be given the option
to unselect.

If you have anything selected the next select has the following options

              A unselect All   B Broaden selctn
^C Cancel     C [unselect Cur] N Narrow selctn

Now 'A'/'C' clears selection(s) and 'B'/'N' modify the current list
of selected messages by adding/removing the specified messages.

Hi -

Could you check your system include files, specifically, arpa/inet.h and
netinet/in.h, to see the prototype of inet_addr() and the definition
of the s_addr member of the in_addr struct?

On every Unix system that I've seen, they are both unsigned long.  One or
the other may be u_long which is the same thing.

Gessh, my fault. Forgot a minor step!

Delete all, X, ?, then press "B" to report a bug. *NOW* it asks if you
want to include the current message (in the bug report). Say "Y" and
it vomits.

Sorry :-(

Hmmm. I just deleted everything in comp.mail.pine (after reading ALL of
the messages in detail, of course :-), eXcluded them, pressed ? for Help
and was NOT prompted for including any message; rather it went to the help 
screen. System: SunOS 4.1.1 and Pine 3.90 (which also seems to run just 
fine on SunOS 5.2/Solaris 2.2 - I always thought that was a little odd :-).

I received two messages explaining this about the same time I figured it
out.  One of them also brought my attention to the broaden and narrow
choices which I had not appreciated yet.

In short, if you have selections and press ; again, then you are given
several choices including unselect.

I'm trying the new opions of pine 3.90. So far everything worked as expected
but now i'm experimenting with the mailcap feature and this gives me some
problems. Just as some other people on this list i didn't find the demo 
mailcap file in the distribution but i downloaded metamail 2.7 and used
that one as an example. I copied it to ~/.mailcap and in the pine debug
file i can find an entry that the mailcap is found and read (and also some
messages about ignoring some lines).
In the mailcap file there is an entry for application/postscript that 
refers to the lpr command.
I mailed myself a postscript file as an attachement, but if i choose
attachement / view, i get an error saying no viewer is found.
What did i forget ? Is there a pinerc variable i have to set to enable
mailcap support ? If some features of the mailcap file are ignored, 
which are supported and where is this documented ?

I also didn't find information about multiple addressbooks at first 
sight, but maybe i should look closer.

I didn't see this file in my home directory, where will it be?

Another problem is the "auto-open-next-unread" never work for me, even
there is really "unread" messages in folders. I have to check every
folder one-by-one. :(

I am running the pre-compiled Sun version of Pine 3.90 under SunOS 4.1.3 
by starting an xterm:
xterm -e pine
The xterm opens with pine, everything seems to function, but when I exit 
pine, and the xterm closes, it leaves me with a core-dump... every time.

I do not get a core-dump when starting any other application in the xterm 
(such as "xterm -e pico file"), nor do I get it when I start the xterm 
separately (ie without the "-e command". 

Should I ftp the source and compile my own version? or is this not at all 
a pine issue?

there is no libcrypt.a on the SCO system. 

Can libcrypt.a be found anywhere via ftp ?

I have made the same change in the Pico 2.4 source (from Pine 3.90 
distribution) to stop that pesky character from appearing in the second 
line of the screen on Linux. The compressed binaries are available from 
the following location:

Pine 3.89 distribution

    ftp://ftp.fammed.washington.edu/pub/pine3.89/pico.gz (52045)
    ftp://ftp.fammed.washington.edu/pub/pine3.89/pine.gz (355107)

    ftp://ftp.fammed.washington.edu/pub/pine3.90/pine.gz (412651)

The files will not be deleted until 9/16/94 at 3:00pm (moved back a week).
BTW, ftp.fammed has an attitude sometimes (be patient). I'll try putting
README's in the directories to explain exactly what I changed. Enjoy!

It appears many of the posts in this mailing list are showing up
in comp.mail.pine.  In an effort to reduce my mail load (with
apologies to procmail, which has done an admirable job), I'd like
to unsubscribe from this list.  Would someone be so kind as to
mail me the magic incantation?

 Unless I've missed it somehow, I don't believe Pine has a
builtin digest routine?

 Has anyone written a -- any awk, nawk or perl scripts to
burst digests within Pine?


   Thanks,

Might be a bug (in 3.90)

On DG/UX (d-g), whenever I make a change to a folder, be it the INBOX or
one of my saved folders, the modification time gets set to Dec 31 1969 and
then Pine notifies me that the modification time changed, by the mailbox
hasn't changed. This isn't a big problem, just an annoyance.  Luckily,
I do full backups to 4mm DAT tapes, so it won't affect our backup strategy.

BTW, I can trigger this just by leaving the folder or expunging it.

Just wondering if anyone else has seen this.  I get a sneaking suspicion 
it is DG/UX specific.   I will start hunting through the source in a few
days here to look for the problem and post patches if no one else has any 
ideas. Thanks.

If you mean that you want to split up a digest into individual messages, 
then I'll have to make yet another reference to the procmail package.
This is includes 'formail' which can split up digests quite easily
(from the 'formail' man page):

     To split up a digest one usually uses:
          formail +1 -ds >>the_mailbox_of_your_choice
     or
          formail +1 -ds procmail

(Standard input is read for data).
I haven't tried to use this with the new pipe feature in Pine 3.9,
but I guess it will work.


Richard.

I intended to cc this to the list, but I mistakenly entered the wrong 
name at the right address. 

Doug has since replied that a32 uses -lcurses, and changing it to
-ltermcap has fixed his problem. Before reading his reply, I tried
running the a32 pine binary - compose worked find, but when I tried
'forward' ( to resend the message below ) or 'reply' ( to Doug's 
message ) it locked up on me. 

So, it looks like it is -lcurses, but ought to be -ltermcap !

When I first installed 3.89, I had frequent problems of pine/pico (on
rs6000/aix 3.2.4 ) locking up when going into compose mode. ( There
may have been other cases of lock up, but going into compose mode was
the one that was somewhat reproducible. ) 

I sent a note to the list at that time, and someone suggested I try
rebuilding with -ltermcap. ( But, I recall that one of the Pine team
(I think) mentioned that they had switched from -ltermcap to -lcurses
previously, because of other aix problems, and they were inquiring if
any AIX-ers knew the "RIGHT" way to build it on that platform. 

[ I also recall combing thru the pine-info archives, and I think the
  consensus there was unclear. ] 

Since rebuilding 3.89, I haven't noticed any problems. 

[ If I neglected to report my success, it was probably that I had
  intended to test a couple of other variables, like xlc vs. gcc
  for example, before reporting, and never got around to finding 
  the time to do that. ] 

However, I did just notice that: 
  my pine has been build with -ltermcap, but the original makefile.a32~ 
	file has -lcurses as the default.
  my pico has been built with -ltermcap, but that is apparently not my 
	edit, but the distribution makefile.a32. 
Could one problem, perhaps be that WHATEVER screen lib pine and pico 
use, that they have to both use the SAME lib ? ( Or maybe, as in your
elm example, you should really use both libraries ? )

Yep. Definite bug. Anyone on the pine team want a debug1 and core file? :-)
Of course, since this is reproduceable, that might not be necessary.

Hello:


If I can use ";" now that I have pine-3.90, then
how come I can not select messages with "+"???
It seems that "S" pretty much covers all other

For those interested in the fix for DG/UX versions prior to 5.4.3 change 
the line
    if ((sin.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr (hostname)) != -1) {
to be
    if ((sin.sin_addr.s_addr = (inet_addr (hostname)).s_addr) != -1) {
this takes care of DGUX's strange but endearing handling of inet_addr.

On DG/UX 5.4.3 it all compiles with no problems of course.

Nope, that one's easy enough to reproduce.  Thanks for the report!

You can do this by going to a message that has status '+' and then
doind  Select/Text/To/Current To or ';TT^T^M'.

Way to go.....

PINE 3.90 is great.
How hard it is to compile on aix? Has anybody done so?
Is anybody out there using Spruce?

I have the same setup, but I used the source.  The result is the same.  I 
get a core file everytime I exit pine when started using:
	xterm -e pine

I don't get a core if I start the xterm and then from a prompt I start pine.

Well, I just compiled PINE 3.90 on someone else's account that's on a AIX
system (RS/6000) and it's version 3.2... So far, there hasn't been any 
problems.   The same can be said for LINUX and SunOS4.13.

I'm sorry, but out of all the nice things the pine people have done, this seems
extremely ridiculous to release a binary to the world with debug options turned
ON.  If I wanted to compile it myself, I would, but the idea with getting a
pre-compiled binary which WORKS, not which is in debug mode.  I noticed they
hadn't even stripped the binaries they have available.  When was the last time
you saw a professional package released which had debug options on and wasn't
even stripped?

Thanks Mat, will try this. Once we upgrade to 5.4.3 then I guess I'll 
have to rebuild Pine the way it came, won't I? This is good to know in 
advance.

I don't have an answer to your question. ( When I need to undigest
something, I usually pop into 'mush' and use the 'undigest' command.)

But I have another question:

How can we get mailing list digesters to start supporting MIME ? 

Wouldn't that be a better way to include a number of messages ? 
Since typically, most digests use "--------" as a break between
mail messages, wouldn't a mime boundary that started with that
sequence be backward compatable for the MIME impaired ? 

[ Is this already standard practice on any mailing lists ? 
  If it is, I haven't noticed it. ] 

One nice feature of using MIME message parts for digests is that
you don't typically have to undigest the whole digest to access 
a single message. 

For Pine, it would be nice if for content type "message", it
would allow Save as optionally, an append to an existing mailbox. 
Even better would be supporting viewing a MIME digest as a sort
of recursive mail-folder.

Can't you use strip to strip the binaries of this very professional 
and 'free' software package?

has anyone managed to build pine on solaris 2.3 with the ansi compiler?
neither pico or pine will build.  i tried using gcc and pico would build,

The new pine looks great! Good job, guys - It was worth the wait!


I noticed that there was a place for local support in the help.
I added a /usr/local/lib/pine.info file with my name and address
and it came up in the help. 

Is there any way, other than wrapping the pine command in a script,
to cause a user notice to pop up ? I would like to warn users that
I'll be replacing 3.89 with 3.90 before I actually do it. 

( We had a number of problems when we upgraded to 3.89 with pine
  locking up - problem and cure recounted in another thread. It
  seems to be fixed, but I'ld still like to warn them. ) 

Or is there a way to add this to the 3.90 startup when it gives 
a newuser message. It clearly checks the status of the config 
file, or some indicator and know when it's the first time the new
version has been run. If I can't warn them ahead of time, I'ld
like to at least customize that message to tell them how they can
run the old version if they run into problems. 

If not, that would be a useful customization to add. 
The best alternative I can think of would be to make a shell
script to replace the pine command, that sends a notification
with /bin/mail before invoking pine ( and leaving a .pine-user-notified
file or something behind ) 


I would also like to make domain addressing the global default,
however, when I tried doing this before, I had problems because
users had to have run a separate 'mailreg' program that registers
their machine address before they could use domain addressing 
without the possibility of a bounce. ( The central server is 
smart enough to TRY to find a unique match to a unregistered name,
but that doesn't always work. )

Similarly, it would be nice if there were some way to add hooks 
to pine to support this mailreg procedure. Again, wrapping pine
in a script would be one solution, but I would perfer to have 
the hooks IN pine, even if it meant recompiling with some 
customization. ( and for captive mail only accounts, it would
be nice if this were more restrictive than the generic "|" . 
One of the nice things about Pine is that it's so well integrated
as mailer/address-book/news/editor - some folks here don't 
really have to learn another program if they don't want to be
bothered. I'ld like to be able to keep it that way! )

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

Subject: What is Pine?

   Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for
   reading, sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed
   specifically with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored
   to accommodate the needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses
   Internet message protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and
   runs on Unix and PCs. 
  
   The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful
   limitation of features, one-character mnemonic commands,
   always-present command menus, immediate user feedback, and high
   tolerance for user mistakes.  It is intended that Pine can be learned
   by exploration rather than reading manuals.  It has the ability to
   perform full screen editing of messages, attachments (such as Word or
   Excel files), and other advanced message system features. 

   Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and
   MIME for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to
   normal messages. 

   
------------ 
Content-Description: What is MIME?

Subject: What is MIME?

   MIME (RFC 1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It
   is an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
   (word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between
   any compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME

Content-Description: What is IMAP?

Subject: What is IMAP?

   IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client
   program on any platform at any location on the Internet can access
   email folders on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be
   local, they reside on the server until the client explicitly moves or
   deletes them.  The IMAP protocol is a functional (but incompatible)
   superset of POP. A principal advantage of IMAP over POP is that it
   permits using more than one computer to access your mail.  Using
   multiple computers with POP typically results in your mail ending up
   scattered across all of those computers. Another key advantage is
   IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages, e.g. you
   don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved until
   you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
   dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see
   the paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP
   vs. POP."
  
   IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email
   on a remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or
   departmental).  There is an IETF working group currently defining the
   IMAP4 revision to the IMAP2 specification (RFC-1176).  A copy of the
   latest IMAP draft may be obtained from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
   file imap/latest-imap-draft

   We don't have a good way to count the number of sites running Pine,
   but at last count over 4,000 sites in 40 countries had downloaded the
   Pine 3.89 distribution from ftp.cac.washington.edu. There are also
   several major archive sites that mirror the distribution, so the
   actual numbers are probably much higher.

   When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
   possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point
   that a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't
   reproduce the problem in the current version, our standard response
   will be to ask you to upgrade.

   This is a known limitation of the current release of pine. When you
   postpone a composition, Pine does not have any way to keep track of
   which message was being replied to (or that it was a reply at all).
   This limitation will be removed in a future release of Pine.

Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

   The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"
   means that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in
   which it expected a start-of-message header line, it found something
   else.
   
   The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
   All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine.
   
   Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
   itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the
   problem go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the
   folder and see what is wrong with the very first line. In particular,
   make sure that there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file
   and that the first character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' ,
   the second an ``r'', the third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an 
   INBOX, you may want to rename the folder so that new mail can be
   delivered while repairs on the corrupt folder are being done. 
   
   Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g.
   /bin/mail) which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the
   beginning of the new data.
   
   Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail
   folder without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This
   is a general problem on UNIX. 
   
   Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
   folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
   system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
   attribute caching.
   
   Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3).
   If the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to
   determine its cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some
   external software. The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2)
   and (3) is that it does not want to risk damaging user data by
   guessing what is right. Pine never writes to the folder unless it is
   absolutely sure it knows what it is doing.
   
   There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
   conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance
   of your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and
   installed Pine on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

   Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
   occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the
   file at the same time.
   
   Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
   UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity.
   
   There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
   There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
   On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call
   it used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of
   lock file as well, but this has not been directly verified.
   
   _NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
   basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
   systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are
   known problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an
   application beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it).
   All of the above mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Content-Description: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

   This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With
   the default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will
   get full access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be
   changed to read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not
   see any further updates to that folder until it is reopened with full
   access. Currently the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and
   restarting Pine. With the Tenex format, any number of sessions can
   simultaneously have full access to a folder, with the exception that
   expunging is disabled. See "What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I
   use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

   The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine
   has discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing
   your mail folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level
   lock used by programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail,
   and by certain programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly,
   this lock is only to be acquired and held for a very short period of
   time (less than a second).
   
   It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that
   message every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the
   time that it will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is
   false -- that is, that whatever program locked the folder forgot to
   unlock it (perhaps it crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the
   lock for itself.
   
   This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
   interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
   _NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting
   to open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will
   trigger this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters
   or less on those systems._

   Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind
   carbon copy) header field. You will see all the names and addresses as
   you compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other
   people's INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

                                       

   Here are a couple ways to use Ispell within Pine: 
    1. Set your alternate-editor to ispell, then ^_ in the composer
       invokes ispell. To do this set "editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell" in
       your .pinerc file. This may be set within Pine via the _OPTIONS_
       task of the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.
       
       Now, when you press ^_ (Control-Underscore) in Pine, you will
       execute the ispell program in its native mode. Press ? for help.
       Press I to insert unknown words into the personal dictionary. You
       can still press Ctrl-T to use the standard pine spell-checking
       program (which will -not- use your personal dictionary). See 'man
       ispell' for more information on the ispell program.
       
    2. Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable so you can
       create the following script and name it spell. 
       

     #!/bin/sh
     ispell -l | sort | uniq 

   To make Ctrl-T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words'
       dictionary: 
          + make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory 
          + make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell' 
          + set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL
            $HOME/spell' (you may include this command in your .profile,
            .cshrc or .login file) 
   
       
       Now, when you press Ctrl-T in Pine, you will execute the ispell
       program, and it will recognize words stored in the private
       dictionary. The screen display will look like pine is using the
       standard spell-checking program. Unfortunately, this method does
       not allow the user to Insert words into the private dictionary.
       However, this might be useful with a central script file (setenv
       SPELL ...) and a central private dictionary (ispell -p ...) to
       provide a common private dictionary for an entire workgroup. The
       manager could add items to the private dictionary; ordinary pine
       users would use the private dictionary (Ctrl-T), but they could
       not change it. 
       
   To use ispell with pico, implement the 'ispell' program via ^T
   (CTRL-T) (using the script file) in addition to implementing it via ^_
   (CTRL-_) (using the .pinerc file). 
     * Use Ctrl-_ in Pine (it won't work in Pico) for full-featured
       ispell. 
     * Use Ctrl-T in Pico to use the ispell program and your
       .ispell_words dictionary (but without the full ispell
       functionality). 
       
   You can use Ctrl-T/ispell in Pine also, but why bother when Ctrl-_
   works better.

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?

                                       

   Three ways to access news via Pine: 
    1. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       

        news-collections=News *[*]

   
       
    2. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]

   
       
       Alternatively, if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from the same server.
       
       
    3. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]

   
       
   The advantage of option #3 is that the same .newsrc can be used for
   both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
   account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

   Pine does not currently support this directly, but here is a
   work-around: 
    1. Move the cursor to the Cc: line. 
    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line. 
    4. Move the cursor where you want it in the body of the message. 
    5. Press Ctrl-U to insert the address. 
       
   This is kind of a round-about way to get the job done, but it works...

   Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
   programs, such as "procmail", or "filter" or "deliver".
   
   Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "filter"
   program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
   mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX.
   
   So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
   message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has
   created? Pine's answer is to let you specify them in your .pinerc, as
   in the example:
   
    
   
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

   In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
   program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class
   into the folder "filter/to-art151" and mail relating to the Art-L
   mailing list into "filter/to-Art-L". 
   
   From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those
   folders. Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may
   have new mail waiting for you, so that you don't "forget" that you
   have more than one place to look for new mail...

   Yes. This is a new feature of Pine 3.90. It is handled as a "custom

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
   Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of
   Pine. If you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients
   already, the following information may be useful. 
  
   The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
   authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication
   is designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with
   alternative authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
   This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of
   c-client you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the
   name of your port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is
   included by the os_xxx.c file.
   
   The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it
   may be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only
   contains that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify
   that file and rebuild imapd.

   No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail
   model (wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the
   local machine and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely
   that this model will be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or
   POP as the access protocol, in a future release.

Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

                                       

   Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or
   mulitple users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost*
   full Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW
   access is that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no
   one can do an Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a
   msg as deleted) *can* be done, and this state is preserved across
   sessions. 
   
   If an explicit Expunge cmd fails, it will say so and tell you that the
   mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session
   left using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again.
   
   In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW
   client at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session
   steals the RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier
   session becoming RO.

Subject: Where does Unix Pine look for configuration information?

  
                                     
   In Pine 3.90, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the Main Menu) contain
   a section on Configuration, including default file names and
   environment variables. 

   In brief, Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide
   file /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, a system-wide non-overridable file
   /usr/local/lib/pine.fixed, and a personal configuration file
   ~/.pinerc. There are certain options which are only found in system
   wide configurations, others only found in personal configurations, and
   still others found in both. For settings found in both pine.conf and
   .pinerc, values in .pinerc take precedence over those in pine.conf, 
   and settings in pine.conf.fixed take precedence over everything.
   
   If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide
   configuration files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib ". Pine
   automatically generates a .pinerc when a user starts Pine for the
   first time.
   
   Starting with Pine 3.90, almost all personal configuration can be
   accomplished through the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.

Subject: Where does PC-Pine look for configuration information?

                                       

   In Pine 3.90, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the Main Menu) contain
   a section on Configuration, including default file names and
   environment variables. 

   In brief, PC-Pine uses the following rules for finding config and
   support files: 

    1. The location of the PINERC is searched for in the following order
       of precedence: 
         1. File pointed to by PINERC environment variable 
         2. $HOME\PINE\PINERC 
         3. A file named PINERC in the same directory as PINE.EXE 
    2. The HOME environment variable, if not set, defaults to root of the
       current working drive. 
    3. The default for external files (PINE.SIG and ADDRBOOK) is the same
       directory as the PINERC file. 
    4. The support files (PINE.HLP and PINE.NDX) are searched for in the 
       same directory as PINE.EXE. 
            
   Starting with Pine 3.90, almost all personal configuration can be
   accomplished through the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.

   Pine does not support some older terminals (e.g. tvi925, WYSE-60) very
   well. Some problems can be overcome with a proper termcap entry, but
   others, such as handling cursor keys, do not have a good solution.

Subject: How do I configure Pine to not leave mail in /usr/spool/mail?

                                       

   You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: How can someone without a MIME-aware mail program decipher an attachment?

                                       
   

   Regarding attachments: Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for this.
   MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) uses "Base64" encoding
   rather than uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are
   transformed by some email gateways, and there are also several
   incompatible versions of uuencode.
   
   However, you can certainly uuencode a file outside of pine, then use
   the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert the encoded
   file in the message.
   
   If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient does need to have
   MIME-capable software. Fortunately, this is not hard to find. Even the
   major proprietary mail vendors have committed to MIME support, but
   some of their upgraded products are still some months away. One
   product which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available from ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the /pub/mpack
   directory.

   A perl script (and conversion to C of same) that converts OpenWindows
   mail to MIME. Body parts currently supported are: text, gif, Sun
   rasterfile (converted to image/gif), postscript, and audio. Other
   types default to application/octet-stream. It's easy to extend the set
   of types supported and to add conversions, if necessary. 
   
   The script requires uuencode, uudecode, zcat (aka uncompress), and the
   "convert" program from ImageMagick. If you don't have ImageMagick you
   can probably substitute the pbm stuff with little fuss. 
   
   The program is available via ftp from cs.utk.edu in

A while back, I mentioned that there was some weird keyboard mapping going 
one between our Novell LAN and Pine (which runs on an Aplle Quadra).  
Basically speaking, ^J and ^M were confused, and if you're not careful, 
everything gets word-wrapped. 
 
Has anyone found a fix for this?  Words to the effect that it was a 
Novell problem came this way, but Novell didn't seem terribly responsive.

Has anyone else run into this problem, and found a fix? 

The newest LAN Workplace for DOS doesn't include a telnet upgrade (the 
assumption is that the telnet module needs fixing). 
 
Please send your responses directly!

Pine does not care whether you have new mail when you start.  You are

you're using PINE if you don't have new mail...you have to say yes or
no as to whether or not you want to use PINE. This is an annoyance

Well, "+" is not really a status flag, but more of a hint.  You can do the
equivalent by selecting by Text/To/yourself...

Hi,

I seem to have a problem with my date that pine inserts in outgoing mail, 
my systems timezone is GMT+0200, but pine puts in my outgoing mail GMT+12000.

My date is correct because if I use ELM or MAIL the date is correct.

My system is Linux kernel 1.1.49 and pine v3.89.

Any ideas.

Thanks
Warwick.

Well, let's see. You can use a command line argument to turn off the
debug mode (READ the HELP pages). And yes, you can VERY easily strip 
the binaries. Now, why would they release a program with the debug mode 
on? Hmmm. Let's think about this. Maybe because it helps the pine team
fix bugs? Yes that's it! That's one of the reasons Pine is so good---
lots of people help the pine team catch bugs and the .pine-debug files
help them to fix the problem. Amazing isn't it?

Almost all of the binaries I download haven't been stripped. And I just
WISH other programmers would release their products with debug mode turned
on (and with a nice way to turn it off on the command line). Bugs and bug
fixes would be found much more quickly. 

This "professional" package is free and the developers are obviously
committed to maintaining it (fixing bugs and listening to the users
comments and questions). Next time, please ask WHY something was done
rather than whining about it.

Ok, first things first. What a release! Pine Team, you done good! ;-)
I had a bit of a problem at first with my Incoming folders and my personal 
addressbook, (turns out 3.90 doesn't like 
$HOME/Mail/Incoming/<foldername>, it would only accept 
Mail/Incoming/<foldername>. This may cause a problem.), but now 
everything appears to be working well. Once I release this to my users 
then we'll see just how good it is. I'm sure they will like the fact that 
they can edit their .pinerc files themselves. Now the only problem is 
figuring out how to give them their own .pinerc file (currently they 
share one).

At any rate, I would very much like to start accessing some newgroups via 
IMAP (I can't get NNTP to work yet) but I do not know how. Could someone 
please tell me? I've got a news collection created, now I just need some 
newgroups. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. TIA.

If that is the problem, there's an *easy* fix.  Just edit the sendmail.cf
file and change the "local delivery mailer" description from

        Mlocal, P=/bin/mail, F=lsDFMmnP, S=10, R=20, A=mail -r $f -d $u
to
        Mlocal, P=/bin/mail, F=lsDFMnP, S=10, R=20, A=mail -r $f -d $u

The "m" flag in the mailer description tells sendmail that this mailer
is able to deliver to multiple users in one transaction.  If you take
out the "m" flag, sendmail will run /bin/mail separately for each user
who's getting mail.

   I saw something on this list last week and did not think I needed it.  
Turns out I do.  I use only our domain name for our e-mail addresses.  Is 
there something that can be set, so the password file is checked (and 
names are expanded)?  Thanks in Advance for help!

Last time I saw unstripped binaries?  How about Ingres!  I "found" about
20 meg of disk on our student comp-sci machine by stripping Ingres.

To the pine team - keep up the good work.

Spruce is yet to be released. The author (Ian.Leiman@nokia.com) had 
intended to release it at the same time as Pine 3.90. But, as it is a 
single man project, the delay is understandable. Also, the first release 
of Spruce is supposed to be functionally equivalent to Pine 3.90.

Yes, as an end user of pine, with limmited knowledge of Unix, I will love
ONE program that would let me do all of my mail houskeeping.
But, alas, I can understand the point raised by those who consider pine an
inapropiate (and inefective) way to filter mail.
What we need is somebody that will take procmail and make it as user
friendly as pine is...
?some unix guru listening out there?

To compile pine on Solaris using gcc:
 
1.  Under the distribution source directory, edit pine/makefile.sol.  Specify
    the following make variables:
 
    CC= gcc
    CFLAGS= -DSV4 $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) -ansi -DANSI -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\"
    LDCC= gcc
 
2.  In pine/osdep, edit the file os-sv4.h and make the following modifications:
 
    /*----------------- Are we ANSI? ---------------------------------------*/
    #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */
 
    /*  #define const           /* compiler doesn't support const */
 
3.  Under the distribution source directory, edit pico/makefile.sol.  Specify
    the following make variables:
 
    CC= gcc
    LDCC= gcc
    CFLAGS=     -Dsv4 -DPOSIX -DJOB_CONTROL -ansi

Is there a way that I can specify the INBOX in PC-PINE dynamically?  For 
instance, I'd like to keep a bunch of PC's in the open lab where students can
go and access their e-mail through PC-Pine and a IMAP server.  Since we keep
new mail in $HOME/Inbox is it possible for me to do...

inbox-path={mailserver}$HOME/Inbox

so that each individual won't have to manually specify the inbox path?  I've
looked through the docs but it's very limited for the PC-NFS version.

Yes fatman, there is... and is called Readmail... and it's *free* (like
pine)

is in any Simtel mirror site. the one that I use is oak.oakland.edu
if you have lynx or any www tool the http is
http://oak.oakland.edu/Simtel/msdos/textutil/
and the file name is RMAIL41.ZIP
with gopher you can conect at: gopher gopher.oak.oakland.edu
then choose #10, then #4 then #4 and then textutil and then rmail41.zip
or, you can ftp to oak.oakland.edu, and do all the cd's

btw, with readmail you can't trully "answer" your mail, but there are ways
around it. I do that anyway using readmail ability to copy the mail in
"answer format" (with >), and then I use pico, pine's editor that's included
in all of the pcpine packages... 
If you need more info, feel free to write to me...

Here are some notes I wrote for pine3.89.  They probably apply to pine3.90 
as well (it's a solaris 2.3 bug--nothing wrong with pine):

7/27/94  jdc

To build pine, I had to modify <unistd.h> on this machine and remove
the prototype for rename().  The man page for rename says it is defined
in stdio.h, but the operating system had it defined in both places.

Build steps:

1) Edit <unisttd.h> and comment out rename() prototype.
 
. . .  (Not relevant to the discussion) . . .

So, try editing /usr/include/unistd.h on your machine and remove the
prototype for rename (it's already in /usr/include/stdio.h).  Then
complain to your vendor about this...

system.  My "sendmail" is in /usr/sbin, but Pine is hardcoded to look in
/usr/lib.  A quick edit and rebuild will cure that problem, but I noticed
that Pine did not pick up on the failure to send mail.  The error message
"/usr/lib/sendmail not found" would blap across the main menu, followed by
the Pine message "Mail Sent".  The debug file also indicated successful
transmission when in fact nothing of the sort had occurred. 


So, should Pine notice that this didn't work?  Isn't there a DOS-like
completion code it can check?  (But I guess a program that didn't run
can't very well set that code, now can it?)

Hi,
I am impressed with the new features of Pine 3.90. However, I am confused
by the procmail rcfile.

My question is about the condition of "From". All I new mail with Subject
"WWW comment" go into the right folder correctly, but the mail from my
friend "jeff@somewhere" never get into the right place and keep in INBOX.

Somebody help me! Thanks in advanced.

I didn't think elm shows mail arrival in "real time"......

But what you can do....if is that important....is to change the line

#define NEW_MAIL_TIME      (150) 

in the appropriate os-XXX.h file in the pine/osdep directory and recompile.

2.5 minutes doesn't seem like such a long time to wait for notification....

I had this problem and am using the binary I built after solving it.

The Solaris build is setup to use the BSD compatible compiler under 
Solaris 2.2. I have Solaris 2.3 and the SunPro ANSI Compiler. My system 
is configured so that the default 'cc' command is the ANSI one, this does 
not like addrbook.c at all. To get it to compile I forced it to use the 
BSD compiler by adding the following line to makefile.sol.

CC=/usr/ucb/bin

Using this pine builds without warnings.

BTW. Everything else builds fine with the ANSI compiler.

Regards,

Mike

Hi,

	If you check the procmailex.5 man page you will note on page two
it has some information if your system does not generate "correct"
leading "From " lines.   

	This is what I suspect is happening....

	One thing you can do is to try to match on ^From:.*jeff and see
what happens.  I believe this will match the "From:" line instead of the 
"From " line.  Since the "From " line comes before the "From:" line I think
procmail is terminating when it does not find the pattern in the "From "
line.   Then again....since I've only started to use procmail.....I
could easily be wrong.  :-(

	You could also do what is suggested in the man page.  If you don't
have the man pages available let me know and I'll email them to you.

Hi,

Mumit Khan (khan@xraylith.wisc.edu) wrote:

: One of my major motivation for checking out Pine was it's ability to read
: MH folders via IMAPD, bug I've been getting some weird results. 

The same reason for me to spend the weekend on installing Pine ;-)

: Platform: (all using pre-compiled binaries from ftp.cac....)
:     client: Pine 3.90 SPARC 10/41 SunOS4.1.3
:     IMAP server: IMAP 3.4 SPARC LX Solaris2.2 (running under inetd)

client: Pine 3.90 on a SparcServer with SunOS 4.1.3_U1
IMAP: same (but another machine) under inetd and tcp-wrapper
MH-version: 6.8.3 #2
all binaries compiled here (whithout any modifications this time)

: Problem:
:     When I `go-to-folder' using {mailhome}#mh/archive/simulation (which 
:     happens to have 1441 articles (I use qt to index articles, so I never 
:     bothered to sub-folder these archives), I get the same article/msg 
:     repeated many many times; eg., the 1st 50 message I get are really 
:     repeats of msg #1, 2nd 50 messages repeats of msg#2, etc.

:     Am I the only one seeing this? I'll experiment some more today with
:     smaller folders to see if it's the size of the folders.

The largest folder I have contains 8886 messages and all the messages
seem to be there (I didn't count them however). Note that I accessed
them locally (not via Imap) with #mh/foldername. 

: Q1. MH Folder view:
:     Can I configure Pine client to see ALL my MH folders (sort of like
:     Xmh) without having to manually specify each of my hundreds of
:     folders in .pinerc?

Try this (prepend {imap-hostname} where necessary) in your .pinerc:

inbox-path=#mh/inbox
incoming-folders="listmail" #mh/newlist
folder-collections=Mail #mh/[],
	Archive #mh/archive/[],
        SubArchive #mh/subarchive/[]

The first one is your normal inbox, the second one (incoming-folders)
are other folders where new mail is deliverd (eg listmail). The
folder-collections are the important thing:

#mh/[] gives you ALL first level MH-folders. Sub-folders are ignored
by the MH-driver in Pine/IMAP but can be added as a new
folder-collection, for example #mh/archive/[] for all folders under the
first level MH-folder archive.  Sub-sub-folders are also an 
other folder-collection. Note that the first collection in
folder-collections is the collection where messages are saved (in the
correct style, see next question). So instead of defining ALL MH
folders you just add folder-collections according to the
sub(sub)folders you have.

: Q2. Writing MH folders:
:     Can I save messages to my mailhome via IMAPD in MH format? (it
:     probably already works -- after my MH folder reading problem, I just
:     didn't dare try this)

Yes, did it quite a few times now. The only problem sofar was that
Pine/IMAP seems to have a problem with creating a folder for postponed
or fcc messages if that folder doesn't exist yet. Creating folders
from the folder-list works. Deleting folders fails, I think because
the standard .mh-sequences file isn't removed by the MH-driver so a
rmdir of the folder gracefully fails.

One other minor glitch is Pine's handling of a drafts folder. I've
configured MH to use a folder drafts to store all draft messages. When
I tell Pine to use this folder (#mh/drafts) for postponed messages I
can store postponed messages fine. But even when the drafts folder is
empty Pine asks me whether I want to use a postponed message for new
compositions. The mere existence of the MH-folder seems to let Pine
believe that there are postponed messages even if the folder is empty ;-(

But from what I've seen now Pine 3.90 makes a good candidate as yet
another mailreader in our office (with a basic rule: mail is stored on
a central machine in MH-style folders, how you read them is up to you).

Q3 is for others to answer ;-)

Unfortunately it will fail if users password contains numbers, so it is 
quite unusable. And so does GNU -s crypt also.

Subject: Incoming Folder in Pine 3.90
Date: 30 Aug 1994 13:21:00 GMT
Message-Id: <33vbns$3m6@offas_dike.sbil.co.uk>

--

Dear All,

Just installed Pine 3.90, and am very pleased. One thing niggles,
however -- I sort my incoming email (with procmail) into one of
many separate folders. Some of these have the current month
appended onto their names, some are purged on a regular basis,
etc.

It would be nice, instead of having to provide a list of folders
that I consider as being `incoming', if Pine could be given a
directory name (ie. ~/mail) and any files found therein would be
considered as a valid mail folder...

Is this possible? Have I missed something? Surely I don't have to
manually maintain a list of valid incoming folders?


	Will.

You might also want to try the gnu version of crypt.  It is made in Denmark,
can be exported to anywhere, but if exported to the US, it cannot be re-exported.

Therefore, do not pick it up at the normal gnu sites in the US, but try some
site outside the us.  For example:

    site=ftp.uni-c.dk
    remote_dir=/pub/gnu

glibc-1.07-crypt.tar.gz

Here is the README:
The GNU C library now includes Michael Glad's Ultra Fast Crypt, which
provides the Unix `crypt' function, plus some other entry points.  Because
of the United States export restriction on DES implementations, we are
distributing this code separately from the rest of the C library.  There is
an extra distribution tar file just for crypt; it is called
`glibc-1.05-crypt.tar.Z'.  You can just unpack the crypt distribution
along with the rest of the C library and build; you can also build the
library without getting crypt.  Users outside the USA can get the crypt
distribution via anonymous FTP from ftp.uni-c.dk [129.142.6.74], or another
archive site outside the USA.  Archive maintainers are encouraged to copy
this distribution to their archives outside the USA.  Please get it from
ftp.uni-c.dk; transferring this distribution from prep.ai.mit.edu (or any
other site in the USA) to a site outside the USA is in violation of US
export laws.


Hope this helps you

JC

Subject: Deletes appear slower in 3.90?

I often get a lot of mail that I know I can delete by just looking at the 
subjects.  I am used to just pressing D while in index mode.  Sometimes I 
will just hold the D key to repetitively delete many messages in a row.
I have noticed that when I do this in 3.90 it is much slower than when I 
did this in 3.89.  Has something changed?  It is not a real problem, just 
a little more of a nuisance.

Thanks for the great work.  3.90 is great!

1.  Introduction

Pine 3.90 and Pico 2.4 have recently been released by the Pine
development team at the University of Washington.  For Pine 3.90, my
"executive summary" is:
   The user interface of Pine 3.90 for "elementary"-use (i.e., for a
   person who does not alter his/her .pinerc file) has changed very
   little.  However, Pine 3.90 has quite a few new features which many
   of our users will love.

The original version of this document was produced for use within my 
department at the University of Durham.  I thought that it might be 
useful to send this slightly revised form to the comp.mail.pine 
newsgroup.  Note: in some places, it covers the same material as the 
"Secrets of Pine 3.90" document.

The remainder of this document has two purposes:
   (a) to identify those parts of Pine's user interface that has changed
       for users who don't configure Pine;
   (b) to illustrate how to make use of the features that are new in
       Pine 3.90.
Purpose (a) is tackled in Sections 2 to 5, and the remaining sections
cover the new features.  In order to use any of the new features you
will need to know how to get to the "Config Screen": this is covered in
Section 6.

Here is an index to the topics raised in this document:
   2.  Postponing more than one message
   3.  Exporting a message to a file
   4.  Saving and viewing attachments
   5.  Moving to the start or the end of a file/message
   6.  Configuring Pine using the "Config Screen"
   7.  Using an alternative editor automatically
   8.  Using more than one addressbook
   9.  Displaying the full headers of a message
   10. Supplying your own headers
   11. Controlling what headers get displayed when composing
   12. Using aggregate commands
   13. Accessing Usenet News from Pine
   14. Piping a message to a Unix command
   15. Bouncing a message to another user
   16. Changing a message's status flag in the folder index

2.  Postponing more than one message

In Pine 3.90, you can postpone more than one message.  The user
interface is roughly the same as in previous versions of Pine except
when you come to retrieve a message having previously postponed more
than one message.  In this case, you will be presented with an index
of postponed messages, and asked which one you would like to retrieve.
Note: you will find that the postponed messages are stored in a folder
called "postponed-msgs".

3.  Exporting a message to a file

If you export a message to a file and the file already exists, in
previous versions of Pine you can either cancel the operation or
append the message to the file.  Pine 3.90 gives you the choice of
cancelling the operation, appending to the file or overwriting the
file.

4.  Saving and viewing attachments

In Pine 3.90, the user interface for saving and viewing attachments is
slightly different from that in previous versions.

5.  Moving to the start or the end of a file/message

In previous versions of Pico and Pine, you can use either W or Ctrl-W
(depending on the context) to find the first line containing a string.
In the new versions, you can follow the W or Ctrl-W by Ctrl-Y to move
to the top line of a file/message/folder-index or Ctrl-V to move to
the end of a file/message/folder-index.

Here's a useful example.  If you are editing a file/message, and you
want to delete from the current point to the end of the file, press:
   (a) Ctrl-Carat, i.e., Ctrl-^ (which is often Ctrl-Shift-6) 
       in order to set a mark;
   (b) Ctrl-W followed by Ctrl-V to move to the end of the file;
   (c) Ctrl-K to cut the marked text.

6.  Configuring Pine using the "Config Screen"

In previous versions of Pine, you had to alter the .pinerc file if you
wanted to configure Pine.  In Pine 3.90, you can configure Pine by
going to the Setup Configuration Screen (which is called the "Config
Screen" in this document).  To find this screen, go to the Main Menu,
press S followed by C.

>From the Config Screen, you can change the settings of some of Pine's
variables.  If you are uncertain as to the purpose of a variable (or a
value), move the cursor so that the appropriate line of the Config
Screen is highlighted, and press ? (for Help).  Any changes that you
make to the Config Screen will eventually be written to your .pinerc
file.  For many changes, the change that you want will be effected
immediately: however, for other changes you will need to leave Pine
and then re-start it.

7.  Using an alternative editor automatically

By default, Pine puts you into the Pico editor when you are editing
the body of a message.  In previous versions of Pine, you can say that
you want to use a different editor by including the value
enable-alternate-editor-cmd in the feature-list variable.  When
editing, you can press Ctrl-Underscore to get into the alternative
editor.

With Pine 3.90, you don't need to press Ctrl-Underscore: you can
automatically go into your alternative editor as soon as if you move
the cursor into the body of the message.  In order to enable this
facility, you need to include enable-alternate-editor-implicitly in
the feature-list variable.  To do this, go to the Config Screen (see
Section 6), move the cursor down to enable-alternate-editor-implicitly
and press X.

So the difference between these two is as follows.  If you have set
enable-alternate-editor-cmd, you choose when you want to use your
alternative editor by using Ctrl-Underscore.  If you have set
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly, you always go into the alternative
editor when you move into the body of the message.

For either to work you also need to indicate the name of your
favourite editor: the best way to do this is to set Pine's editor
variable.  So, re-visit the Config Screen, moving down to the line
starting "editor =".  This line is almost at the bottom of the Options
Menu.  Press A (for "Add Value") and then type in the name of your
favourite editor: vi, emacs, axe, xedit and ed are all known to work.
If you have your own special editor, and the setting of Unix's PATH
variable does not mention the directory containing the editor, you can
type in the full pathname for the file containing the binary of the
editor, e.g. ~/tools/eddie

8.  Using more than one addressbook

In previous versions of Pine, you were able to store a list of
mail-aliases in a file called .addressbook.  With Pine 3.90, by
setting the addressbook variable you can have several addressbooks and
can choose the names of the files for these addressbooks.  

To do this, go to the Config Screen (see Section 6) and then move the
cursor down to the line beginning "addressbook=".  Press A (for Add
Text) and then type in a comma-separated list, where each entry in the
list can consist of a nickname followed by a space followed by the
name of the file containing the addressbook.  For example:
   B J C .myaddressbook,Project-X project-x/etc/addressbook
refers to the two files .myaddressbook and project-x/etc/addressbook.

When Pine wants to determine whether an address is a nickname, it will
search these addressbooks in the order that they have given in the
above list.  To speed up the "look-up", Pine also creates an
additional file (with extension .lu) for each addressbook.  If it is
unable to create this file in the same directory as the addressbook,
it will create a temporary look-up file in /usr/tmp or /tmp.

Besides personal addressbooks, Pine 3.90 also allows one or more
global addressbooks.  This is done by configuring the variable
global-address-book.  Global addressbooks can be used by system
administrators to set up site-wide addressbooks.  When searching
addressbooks, personal addressbooks are searched before global
addressbooks.

9.  Displaying the full headers of a message

As in previous versions of Pine, if you want to see the full headers
of a message, you have to do two things:
(a) The feature-list variable should include enable-full-header-cmd.
    To do this, go to the Config Screen (see Section 6), move the
    cursor down to enable-full-header-cmd and press X.
(b) When you go to a folder index or you are viewing the contents of a
    message, press the H command.  It is a "toggle": press H again to
    switch it off.
In Pine 3.90, if you can currently see the full headers of a message,
then, when you forward a message, it will ask you whether you want to
forward the message as a MIME attachment.  The full headers will also
be printed/exported if you use the Y or E command.

10. Supplying your own headers

You can supply your own headers or set default values for the standard
headers by setting the customized-hdrs variable.  To set this
variable, go to the Config Screen (see Section 6) and then move the
cursor down to the line beginning "customized-hdrs =".  Press A (for
Add Text) followed by a comma-separated list of the names of the
headers that you want to be included, e.g.:
   Bcc:username@machine.site.domain

11. Controlling what headers get displayed when composing

You can control what headers are displayed on the screen when you are
composing a message by setting the default-composer-hdrs variable.  To
set this variable, go to the Config Screen (see Section 6) and then move
the cursor down to the line beginning "default-composer-hdrs =".
Press A (for Add Text) followed by a comma-separated list of the names
of the headers that you want to be displayed, e.g.:
   To,Cc,Bcc,Subject

12. Using aggregate commands

The A, Z and ; commands form the "aggregate command set".  The ;
command allows you to select all the messages that match some
criteria; the A command allows to apply some command to each of the
selected messages; and the Z command allows you to zoom in on the
selected messages by changing the folder index temporarily so that
only these messages are displayed.  In order to use any of these
commands, you need to have enable-aggregate-command-set included in
the setting of the feature-list variable.  To do this, go to the
Config Screen (see Section 6) and then move the cursor down to the line
containing enable-aggregate-command-set and press X.

Here are some more details about the aggregate commands.

The ; command selects messages in the folder index according to a
criterion that you choose.  It can be one of the following: (a) all
messages, (b) a list or a range of message numbers, (c) messages
containing a particular string within the From, To, Cc or Subject
lines or within the entire text of the message, (d) the current
message, (e) messages on/before/since a specified date, (f) messages
that have a status flag of new/deleted/answered/important.

Having chosen the criterion, the selected messages are indicated in
the folder index by a X in the first column (unless the
show-selected-in-boldface feature has been chosen).  There is another
way in which you can show which messages have been selected: if you
issue a Z command after a ; command it will temporarily restrict the
folder index to the selected messages --- pressing Z again returns you
to the full folder index.

If you have already used a ; command (to select a set of messages),
then, if you type ; command again, Pine will ask you whether you want
to (i) unselect all the selected messages, (ii) unselect the current
message, (iii) add more messages to the set of selected messages, (iv)
remove some messages from the set of selected messages.  If you choose
(iii) or (iv), then you can indicate the criterion by which messages
are added to, or removed from, the current selection.  Once again, the
criterion can be any of those labelled (a) to (f) above.

Having selected a set of messages, you can use the A command to apply
any of the following operations to the set of selected messages: save,
export, print, delete, undelete, reply, forward, takeaddr, flag or
pipe.

13. Accessing Usenet News from Pine

In previous versions of Pine, you were able to read the newsgroups of
Usenet News.  In Pine 3.90, there are additional facilities, e.g., you
can subscribe/unsubscribe to newsgroups and post articles to
newsgroups.

In order to access Usenet News, you should go to the Config Screen (see
Section 6), move the cursor down to the line starting "nntp-server =",
press A (for Add Text) and then type the address of an nntpserver:
   newsserver.site.domain 
Note that it is not necessary to set the news-collections variable.
Although optional, I believe it is also useful to include
expanded-view-of-folders in the setting of the feature-list variable.
To do this, move down to expanded-view-of-folders, and press X.

You will now need to leave Pine, and re-start it.  If you then press L
to get the folder-list you will see a section headed News-collection.
If you move to this section, you can press A followed by the name of a
newsgroup in order to subscribe to that newsgroup.  If you are
uncertain about the name, then follow the A by Ctrl-T in order to list
the names of all the newsgroups.  If you press W at this point, you
can find out those newsgroups whose names contain a particular string.

The information about which newsgroups you are subscribed to is
written to the file .newsrc.  If you don't want your subscribed
newsgroups to be displayed in alphabetical order, you may set the
news-read-in-newsrc-order feature.  To do this, go to the Config Screen
(see Section 6) and then move the cursor down to the line containing
news-read-in-newsrc-order and press X.  You also need to edit your
.newsrc file so that the lines appear in the order that you wish to
look at the newsgroups.

Once you have subscribed to the newsgroups which you think you may be
interested, you can use them just like mail folders.  

When you have read an article, you can use the D command to record the
fact that you have already seen it.  This information is also stored
in the .newsrc file.  In this way, the article will not be presented
to you the next time you read Usenet News.

If you already have the folder for a newsgroup open, you can use the C
command to post an article to the newsgroup.  If you want to follow-up
an existing article, or you want to reply to the sender of an article,
use the R command.

Although Pine does not have a command to "catch up" in a newsgroup
(that is, to mark all the articles as deleted), you can use Pine's new
aggregate command set (see Section 12) to do this.  Pressing the four
keys ;aad will cause all the articles in the current folder to be
marked as deleted.  So these articles will not be shown the next time
you enter the newsgroup.

14. Piping a message to a Unix command

When you are in a folder index or have a message displayed on the
screen, you can pass the current message to the standard input of a
Unix command by using | which is Pine's "pipe" command.  In order to
use this command, the feature-list variable must contain the value
enable-unix-pipe-cmd.  To do this, go to the Config Screen (see
Section 6) and then move the cursor down to the line containing
enable-unix-pipe-cmd and press X.

15. Bouncing a message to another user

If user-1 sends a message to you but it really should have gone to
user-2, then, in Pine 3.90, you can use the B command to "bounce" the
message to user-2.  The effect is that user-2 will receive a message
as if it were from user-1 but with some additional lines indicating
that has been resent by you.  In order to use the B command, your
feature-list variable needs to include enable-bounce-cmd.  To do this,
go to the Config Screen (see Section 6) and then move the cursor down
to enable-bounce-cmd and press X.

16. Changing a message's status flag in the folder index

You can change the status flag shown for a message in the folder index
by * which is the flag command.  Besides the normal flags of N, D, U,
you can also set a flag to I meaning Important.  In order to use this
command, the feature-list variable must contain the value
enable-flag-cmd.  To do this, go to the Config Screen (see Section 6)
and then move the cursor down to the line containing enable-flag-cmd
and press X.

	You've come to the right newsgroup/mailing list.

	Now all you need to do is send a follow-up message with details
of your problems.  As always, be as specific as possible and you
chances of receiving an answer will be greatly increased.

The only one I've seen botched it.  They wound up putting the entire
digest after the final boundary of the multipart, which was coincidentally
the first boundary of the multipart.

My problem with this is that digest messages aren't required to be mail
messages in the normal sense of the word.  They don't have to have
headers, for example.  One hopes this feature won't get used much.

Alas, at the moment it is not possible to specify a directory in the 
Incoming Message collection.  We will be revisiting this issue when we
work on hierarchy support for Pine 4.0.

The wait was well worth it. I really like the enhancements in 3.90. Great 
job, Pine Team.

I do have one suggestion for another enhancement. Add a command to 
unexpand a folder collection or addressbook. It's a minor irritation, but 
it'd be nice not to have to type two letters navigating menus when a 
single keystroke could do the same thing.

Now off to figure out some more of these features.

Wim,

I fixed this by substituting ALL empty lines in the mailcap file with a
single # character (:1,$s/^$/#/ for vi adepts ;-).

It appears that Pine chokes on empty lines (regards them as the end of the
file) and never reaches the application/postscript definition.

Regards,

Xander

Actually, I have found a mailing list talking about procmail, but no
answer for now. Sorry for asking about procmail here again!

This time I found something strange. I substitute the "jeff" with an-
other person and the procmail work! The only difference I can figure
out is that this man is at the same domain as I am, but jeff isn't.

We are running SunOS with NIS and a local domain name "dblab", I found
all mail sent from machines in our lab can be recognized by procmail.
The "Subject" condition can work is because I use our machine as smtp
server for people who want to send comments to me. I sent a mail with
subject contained "WWW comment" from other machine and the procmail
failed again!

Now I use "filter" and work fine, but there is no "You have new mail"
message when I login. It seems the elm has to be re-compiled with
some patch to do that.

I do believe that procmail is more powerful, but why can I just use it :~(
Does anyone has experience running procmail with NIS?

hi all,

i've just been trying out the latest Version of Pine and although, as you 
can see, I've managed to set up a reply-to field for myself, I don't 
really want to do it for everyone that uses mail.

At hull university, all outgoing mail passes through a mail hub that 
translates 

userid@host.dept.hull.ac.uk 

into 

Initial1.initial2.surname@dept.hull.ac.uk

as far as the outside world is concerned, they see the "departmental" 
e-mail addresses instead of the actual host specific ones.

When dealing with USENET as we primarily use UNIX boxes to provide the 
clients, we've modified various scripts to use the contents of the 
REPLYTO environment variable when posting news. The REPLYTO variable is 
set by a prog that obtains a persons e-mail address from our X.500 database.

Ideally I'd like to be able to do the same thing for PINE. 

If a person is posting to a news group I need to have the reply-to field 
set up with a persons "departmental" address rather than the "host 
specific" one.

Anyone know if there's a possible way of doing this without delving into 
the source code?


Ideally I'd like to do it for the PC-DOS version as well.

alex

Subject: Pine for SCO w/bug fix
Date: Tue, 30 Aug 1994 14:56:23 GMT
Message-Id: <CvCs5z.Lx3@ssi.edc.org>

Feeling an irresistable urge to FTP another megabyte of data for no 
particular reason, I have uploaded another Pine binary package (Pine, 
Pico, imapd, ipopxd, man pages) for SCO Unix to soils.agron.iastate.edu
in the /pub/incoming directory.  If they're not tired of hearing from me 
yet, this package will probably be moved into /pub/sco/unix/pine someday.
The file is called "pine3.90.dist.sco.fix.tar.gz".

Thanks very much to the Pine Development Team and especially to Mark 
Crispin, for fixing a core-dump bug I found in the MMDF handling code 
which occurs only under very limited circumstances (a message has to 
start within a handful of bytes of the chunk boundary - a 1 in 2000 
chance, and even then only if your mailbox is larger than one chunk).  
Since two of my users with huge mailboxes found this problem out, I made 
haste to make new binaries for SCO lest other people should have it as 
well.

You will want to re-download the code, because even if you haven't seen 
the bug yet, it will bite you some day years from now when you've 
forgotten where you got your code.  If you can't wait for the official 
patches to make their way out into the real work (check 
ftp.cac.washington.edc if you're unsure), you can send me mail, and I'll 
mail them to you.

Well, it depends on how many messages you have to delete.  For instance, 
going in and cleaning out a sent-mail folder can take a _real_ long time 
if you have to wait a full second for each message.  That, incidentally, 
is what I think the problem may be.  There is a default 1-second sleep 
after each status message is printed, and I think message deletions count 
as status messages.  Is there a way to flag those messages as not worthy 
of a full-second delay?

p.s. I know, I know, where was that suggestion during the beta phase...

I would not mind if I could easily select each message to be deleted and 
then delete them.  The problem is, pressing ;c for each message is more 
work than just pressing d for each.  Is it possible to get a one key 
select current message?  Even if this were possible, will it run into 
same problem as above?

Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

   The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is
   bi-directionally gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described
   below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,
          tricks, etc. Often technical and installation questions appear
          on the list. New releases, fixes and version of Pine are
          announced on the pine-info mailing list.
          
          For official announcements only, you may wish to see
          pine-announce instead of this list.
          
          To subscribe to pine-info, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
          

        subscribe pine-info

   in the body of the message.

   Pine-Announce@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Announce is a announcement list for the email program
          Pine. When new Pine products are released and old ones updated,
          a message goes out to this group describing the development. It
          is a very low volume list and includes no discussion
          whatsoever.
          
          _All messages to this list are automatically forwarded to
          pine-info, so it is not necessary to subscribe to both lists._
          
          To subscribe to pine-announce, send a message to
          majordomo@cac.washington.edu with 
          

        subscribe pine-announce

   in the body of the message.
          
          Owners of this mailing list can be contacted at
          owner-pine-announce@cac.washington.edu.
          
   IMAP@CAC.Washington.EDU 
          This is the official mailing list for the IETF IMAP working
          group and other interested parties. Discussion of the evolving
          IMAP standard and related issues is conducted on this list.
          
          To subscribe to IMAP, send a message to
          imap-request@cac.washington.edu.
          
   C-Client@CAC.Washington.EDU 
          This list is for discussion of the C-Client library which is
          used by Pine and various other mail and IMAP clients and
          servers.

    Could it also be that these msgs are actually deleted as you
    press the 'D' key?  I have noticed the same effect, but have
    switched to using the aggregate commands to take out a whole lump
    of msgs.  This method does not always work, since not all
    messages have something in common...

    On the one second default delay,  I would personally rather
    search the .pine-debugX files for any msgs that I miss, than wait
    for a second each.  This is truly a nit, just getting me 0.02

You can specify directories of folders as either folder-collections or
news-collections.  We have considered various ways of adding groups of
folders to the incoming list, but decided to defer any action for now...

Message-Id: <CvCx1D.8qF@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk>

Why has the imap directory in the pine source tree always had an ANSI and
non-ANSI set of sources ?

Surely the use of #ifdef __STDC__ can merge the two together ? Considering
that the ANSI tree takes up 1.7MB and the non-ANSI takes up a further 1.12MB,
this is something that needs attention [it is one of the main reasons that
pine3.90.tar.Z is so large !].

Hi folks. First off, I have to say this again, Pine Team...3.90 is wonderful!

Now, I was having a problem under 3.86 that I was hoping would be solved 
in 3.90. It seems that my ^O key responds as ^C under Pine. I tried 
changing terminal types, but this does not seem to help. 

I was originally defined as vt100, now I'm using ansi. Under the ansi 
setting pressing ^O moves me to the next word. Any suggestions?

Dion

I'm more accustomed to VMS MAIL.  So I'm used to typing

	send filename

when I want to include a pre-typed text file in a message.  How can I do 
this in PINE?  I've got a posting that I saved, and now want to include it 
in my mail message text.

Thanks for the help

While in the Pine Composer, type ^R.  (You can see ^R on the bottom as 
"Read File").  This will prompt you to enter the file name, or you can 
hit ^T to bring up a file list.  Not so hard, actually, and quite a nice 
facility.

Is anyone running pine with Wyse 50's as terminals?  The arrow keys send 
inconvenient control characters.  I know you can use N, P, Space, and -, 
or ESC arrow key, but that is very annoying, especially in pico.

We use SCO ODT 3.0, but that shouldn't matter.

I can suspend Pine 3.89 (Solaris version) while composing a message if I 
press ^Z in the header section.  However, I get "Unknown Command: ^Z" 
if I do so in the "Message Text" area.

Any hints?

Incidentally, a hearty thanks to The Pine Team for Pine 3.89!  It may not
be as good as Pine 3.90, but hey!... = )  We've put tons of people here 
on it.  Thanks again and again....

My printer is an HPLaserJetIII. When I use the "y" command to print out 
an email message, it prints as expected but the printer always spits out 
an extra blank page. This also happens when I try to print a news item in 
Tin. I have tried both ansiprt and ansiprint, but I still get the extra 
pages.

Any advice on this? Many thanks.

<*sigh*> Yes, we use pine on WY-50's as well. Currently only one user 
uses it, but there will be more. We're running DG/UX 5.4.201 and have not 
been able to get the Wyse terminals to function properly since it was 
installed. I've just told my users to forget about using cursor keys. 
I've spoken with both Wyse and DG and neither one was able to offer any help.

No help here, sorry. But if somebody manages to enlighten you, please be 
kind enough to pass the info my way. Thanks. Good luck!

Concerning your question about getting an extra blank page when printing 
from PINE:

Is your LaserJet attached to a network?

In Novell, the "capture" command can be set to send a form feed at the end
of the print job, and I assume other networks have a similar option.  The
extra form feed is unnecessary in this case, so it produces a blank page. 

When running "capture" in Novell, the flag "nff" suppresses the extra 
form feed, as in:

     capture q={queue_name} nff

If you're not printing through a network, I'm stumped.

Herbert,
Pine's builtin printer code is not very configurable, and it does indeed 
send a trailing form-feed... (many printers require it.)  To get around
this, use Pine's custom print command, and an external program called 
"ansiprt" that comes with the pine distribution in the contrib directory.
It doesn't send the trailing FF.  (As it happens, "ansiprt" is already 
installed on Stein).

OK, I'll read *all* of your message this time :)

Since you've already tried ansiprt, and it also happens from tin, I'd be 
looking on the desktop side of the equation...  Presumably local printing 
doesn't have this problem, so maybe it is your comm software (where the 
ANSI printer escape codes are interpreted)?  

If there is any way to divert the print stream to a file, that might help 
determine whether the FF is coming from the remote host, or being added 
locally.

(Sorry about the previous non-answer.)

the way we got around the problem was to add

#ifdef SUN
	signal(SIGHUP,SIG_DFL);
#endif


before the 
#ifdef DEBUG
    fclose(debugfile);
#endif    

in the quit_screen procedure of pine.c

I have determined the cause of the problem reading MH folders via imapd 
on Solaris.

The imapd binary for Solaris which we distributed was bad.  This is caused
by a known problem in which a SVR4 program on Solaris can be lunk with the
BSD compatibility libraries without any error being reported.  The
structures returned by readdir() on BSD and Solaris are very similar; the
filenames are offset by two bytes.

It's an environmental problem, based upon your path and evidentally the 
phase of the moon and the blood type of the guy doing the build.  Haven't 
figured it out yet, although we've chased a lot of false clues.

Anyone who builds Pine on Solaris from sources should be aware of this
problem.  You can see whether or not the build was correct by checking the
results of expanding a folder collection; if the first two characters are
missing, the bug has bit.  Be sure to check both local and IMAP access;
this time Pine was fine and imapd was broken. 

Corrected imapd-bin.solaris and imapd-bin.solaris.Z files are now on
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  All the pre-built binaries should run correctly. 

We apologize for the difficulty.

It sounds like some communication software or hardware is intercepting the ^O
and altering it.  This could be a terminal emulator, a terminal server,
communications switch, etc.

Yes, the .mh-sequences file doesn't seem to be handled,
explaining why (permanent) flags handling doesn't work with MH at
all, right Mark? (At least for me it doesn't.) If this is
correct, I think it should be mentioned in the documentation.

Subject: Any way to get just-send-8-bit with Pine?
Date: 31 Aug 1994 12:04:39 +0300
Message-Id: <341h37$s77@serifos.Helsinki.FI>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

University of Helsinki has gone totally 8bit in e-mail and
news, using ISO Latin1 as the default character set. Now, the 
only problem is Pine, who wants to code everything written
in Finnish with QUOTED-PRINTABLE.

Almost all our mail agents are MIME-capable, so it is not
all that big of a problem, but we'd like to turn that feature
off nonetheless. For example, people can't use normal tools
to access their sent-folders and now with Pine 3.90, all news
written with Pine to Finnish newsgroups are QP'ed. Which is
not a good thing since news readers are not that far advanced
with MIME-support.

So, is there a simple way to switch QP off and get standard
	Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
	Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit 
messages? Or do I have to hack into the code to get this?

P.S. For e-mail going out of University of Helsinki, we have
     a swedish program called Emil linked with sendmail to
     get the QP-encoding for non-8BITMIME hosts.

I built Pine 3.90 yesterday without any trouble at all, using Sun's ANSI 
compiler. This is what I did:

. Edited pine/osdep/os-sv4.h and made 3 changes:

  . Set the locations of the pine global configuration files;
  . De-commented the setting of ANSI;
  . Commented the null definition of "const".
  
. Edited pine/makefile.sol and made one change:
  
  . Commented out the compiler flag setting for -g -DDEBUG.
  
. Typed "build sol" at top level. 

I have been using it without any problems ever since.

You will get these errrors if you are using Sun's C compiler.   You need 
to ensure that you are running Sun's C compiler with the -Xs option:
   cc -Xs -DSV4   -g -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\"  -c  addrbook.c

When compiling the Pine 3.90 distribution for SunOS 5.3 (a part of Solaris
2.3), I make sure that the setting of PATH includes a directory that 
contains a file called cc that contains the following script: 
   #!/bin/sh
   echo Using /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -Xs $*
   /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -Xs $*

Hurray for pine 3.90!!!!
Thanks to the pine development team....but I need some help
trying to sort out usenet news reading:

After configuring the our news server with pine I get
the following error when attempting to read in the news groups:

 [Can't connect to hermod.uio.no,143: Connection refused]

I have been unable to find out what this error actually means.
Hermod.uio.no is our nntp server and runs as most on port 119.

Does anyone have a clue as to what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks!

R:)

When trying to bounce a message in the winsock version of pine all I 
manage to bounce is the message header (enable-bounce-cmd is checked) and 
not the body text. Has anyone else had this problem?

Howdy,

I have installed pine 3.90 onto my system now and I want to stop it from 
creating these debug files .pine-debug?, is there a switch to turn it off 
or how do I go about it?

Thanks in advance

Hi,

I am running pine 3.90, but can't seem to post messages to my newsgroups, 
it keeps coming up saying "no server defined for newsgroups" even if I 
put in my domain name in the nntp-server option it doesn't work.

Basically I am running Linux, cnews, pine 3.90..

Anyone?

Thanks,
Warwick

	You need to put the name of a "host" that is acting as an
NNTP server.  Not your domain name.

	Well, yes there is...and had you spent a little time reading the
help screens you may have found it....  :-)

	Try typing "pine -h" and notice all the switches that are
available.  Guess what "pine -d 0" does....

As things stand I believe you can suppress the debug files by adding "-d 
0" to your Pine command line:

	pine -d 0

Alternatively you should recompile it without the -DDEBUG option to the C 
compiler.  This will omit all debugging code from the compiled binary 
(ie, the "-d levelno" option to Pine will not have any effect)

Here I have compiled up Pine without debugging for general release, and 
recompile a version WITH debugging as/when the need arises (very rarely!).

No and yes... We have almost the same problem, and I am
working on a patch for it.

   I just compile pine 3.90 (on Soalris 2.3).  I have in my .pinerc file 
the auto-move-read-msgs feature set.  I also have 
read-message-folder=1read set.  When I quit pine, it panics just after 
"about to end tty" message in .pine-debug file.  If I comment out the 
line "read-message-folder=1read" in my .pinerc file, everything works 
just fine (except it does not move my read messages).  This worked fine 
on pine3.89.  Any ideas?  TIA

Thanks !
Well here's what I get when I run (the new winsocks) PC-Pine:

[Can't connect to genesis.tdhca.texas.gov,143: Refused (10061)]

And I already included IMAPd on our server (and thought I had it 
running under "inetd" on port 143 !)
So I don't know what I'm missing.  I've got the sockets on my PC and IMAP 
on the server...

Can someone help?

Thank you !

Hi!

I like the new version of Pine a lot but there are some annoying
little shortcomings. Here's one: I want to select messages for
group action (Apply-Save for instance) and now I have to press
two keys to select one message! Ok, one gets used to that but
then I have to press <N> to advance in the list. 

In the next release of Pine there definitely should be a way to
select the current message with *one* key and pressing this key
should advance in the list.

-=Marko=-

PS Anyway, I'll stick to Pine 3.90 - It *is* great!!! :-)

Hi,
I have encountered some problems while handling mail sent from mailing list.

The mail came from mailing list has a header like this "To: fvwm" or "Cc: 
fvwm". When I read this message in Pine, the address of "To:" or "Cc" became
"To: fvwm@db39.ee.ncu.edu.tw" which should be "fvwm@shrug.org".

Is it the fault of mailing list or I haven't set the Pine right? I have added
a nickname "fvmn" in address book and enable the "user-lookup-if-domain-
mismatch" already.

Thanks.

 Some MIME mail programs send an mail and its attachements in multiple
parts if they're bigger than a given size (32 Kb for example). Does Pine
handle these splitted mails correctly and if not will a future release 
do it?

	After you made the necessary changes to your system...added the
entry in the /etc/services file...added the entry in the inetd.conf
file...you did a kill -1 on the inetd process?

Date: 31 Aug 1994 09:27:02 -0400
Message-Id: <3420f6$mdl@ucunix.san.uc.edu>

In my .pinerc file, I have the following entry:

incoming-folders=unix-in-imap		{ucunix.san.uc.edu}inbox,
	cubbyhole-in		{cubbyhole.bch.uc.edu}inbox,
	unix-in-direct		inbox,
	beecher-in		{ucbeh.san.uc.edu}inbox

I run pine (3.90) while I am logged in to ucunix. The unix-in-direct
entry does not appear in the Incoming Message Folders selection
area. Why not?

Message-Id: <3420uj$nbj@ucunix.san.uc.edu>

I am running the precompiled version of 3.90 for solaris. When I
run as root there are no problems, but when I run as myself it
gives me a "Received abort signal" message and dumps core---every
time.

Here is the .pine-debug file:

It seems that MIME does not really understand the message/external-body 
subtype: viewing the FAQ-pointer in the comp.mail.mime newsgroup, I could 
not automatically retrieve the FAQs with ftp. GNUS with metamail support 
handles this correctly.

Furthermore, it would be very nice if RFC 1522, that allows ISOLATIN 
characters in message headers, would be implemented. I get a lot of 
messages from Eudora users; they look kind of strange with the raw Q 
encoding.

Has anyone managed to get the Winsock Pine working with PC-NFS versions 
5.0 or 5.1? I can't -- while I can read the remote folders any operation 
on them (especially forward or mail) hangs the machine. This does not 
happen when I use the Beame and Whiteside TCP/IP stack. Any configuration 
pointers would be appreciated.

Subject: Compiling on Ultrix

I am hearing all these wonderful things about Pine 3.90. Now what I don't get
is why I am having problems with compiling. There seems to be the necessary
setup for Ultrix which I am obviously running, but I still get there errors.
The linker error below is the first with the undefined *drivers. I have no clue where to go from here. Then it is looking for ./bin/imapd which I have no clue what to do with. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi,

I wonder if pine was ever installed on the new SGI Indy 5.2 system ?

I have problem compiling ...

Thanks

   I am having the same problem.  It appears to be associated with the 
"auto-move-read-msgs" feature.  That is as far as I have it debuged.  If 
I delete the above feature and the "read-messages-folder" lines from the 
.pinerc file, then it works just fine.

It looks like you have a news-collection configured for IMAP access 
rather than NNTP access.  You should have

	news-collections=*{hermod.uio.no/nntp}[*]

Pine does not yet support 8BITMIME (as opposed to just-send-8-bit, which Pine
will never support :)

Subject: pine 3.90 doesn't build under HP-UX with +O3 optimisation
Message-Id: <CvEpIC.5v9@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk>
Date: Wed, 31 Aug 1994 15:54:12 GMT

Just thought folks might like to know that the pine directory in
pine-3.90 contains source code that doesn't build correctly with +O3
under HP-UX 9.X and HP's ANSI C compiler (Revision A.09.66). I haven't yet
narrowed it down to an individual file, but I suggest HP-UX users reduce
the optimisation to +O2 +Onolimit if they've tried +O3.

Also, a couple of makefile.hpp's (in pico and pine) mention -Dhpp and -DHPP,
but a quick grep for the use of these turns up nothing, so they seem to be
irrelevant now.

Plus, the files imap/ANSI/c-client/strstr.c and imap/ANSI/c-client/strol.c
attempt to redefine strstr() and strtol(), both of which are available under
HP-UX :-(

BTW, there's an uninitialised variable in the pine-3.90 source code:

pine/filter.c (line 681) - the c character is not given a value, so I used
char c='\0'; to initialise it.

If you want a version of pine 3.90 that compiles OK with HP-UX and the ANSI C
compiler, then check out /hpux9/Users/pine-3.90.tar.gz on one of our official
sites below. It also comes with an "elm-to-pine" alias converter script, some-
thing the pine folks deliberately omitted !

	Well, there is nothing wrong with pine.

	The problem is at the user's end that sent out the message.
The To: and  Cc: fields should have been rewritten with the FQDN.
Since they showed up without the right-hand side pine assumes (rightly so)
that the address is a local address and (for show) appends the local
information.

Hello Jan,

	IMHO, pine *is* truly and fully compliant with the MIME standards.

	Compliance means that you implement all of the "required" aspects
of the standard.  It also means that your software shouldn't "break"
when it encounters aspects that it does not support.  

	There plans to support 1522 and other features of MIME.  And
when support is added for these features I fully expect that they will
comply with the standard.

	Out of curiosity...can you tell us what UA implements "all"

There are several places that the bogus address might have been generated,
including the mailing list manager and whatever mail transports the message
passed through.  The bottom line is that if Pine sees an address that is not
complete, it has to guess how to complete it.  In some cases this will be
correct, in others it will not.

Pine does meet the minimal conformance requirements of RFC1521.  We have not
yet completely implemented some of the optional subtypes, like
message/external-body, but we are working on them.  We also intend to support
RFC1522 in a future release....

The imapd on your server doesn't seem to be running for some reason.  You
should be able to "telnet genesis.tdhca.texas.gov 143" to test it...

Well since you don't live in the USA, it is illegal (by USA law) to export
that library.  SCO have an 'Internation Crypt Supplement' that will allow
you to compile your program:

ftp from ftp.sco.com:/SLS/lng225b.Z

I believe that the limitation is that you can encrypt, but not decrypt.

Is it possible to set a default addressbook for the system, by putting the
addresses in one place and then linking everyone's .addressbook to it? and if
so, then can ppl add their own addresses at will but still always have the
latest version of the default addressbook?

Although what you have written is actually technically correct, readers of
your message may get the impression that the Pine distribution does not
build OK as distributed.  It does build straight out of the box by typing: 
   build hpp
If you do this, you will get the following options:
   cc -DHPP   -g -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"HPP\" -c filename.c

Since the OSF port is user contributed, I figured it would do the most good
to post this to the newsgroup.

PINE 3.90 will build on DEC OSF/1 V3.0 right out of the box, but it is slow,
very slow, slower than 3.89. I changed the following things in the makefiles
for pine, pico, and c-client:

1) get rid of symbolic debugging by removing the -g compiler switch
2) change the optimization from -O to -O2 to increase optimization level
3) change -Olimit 800 to -Olimit 900 so that all routines will be optimized

This resulted in a marked speedup.

FWIW

I would also like to say pine 3.90 is great!  As a site supporter for
elmer (our locally improved elm)  I am further tipped to teaching
pine for new users on campus.  This brings with it problems of
those trying or changing over.

Without any .pinerc (the first time user but elm user), pine dies because the
mail directory already exists.  However if a .pinerc is copied in
prior to invoking pine a mail directory is not created for those
who haven't used anything before and of course then no mail can
be sent because mail/sent can't be created.

Have I missed something in the installation?

I am sure other sites have the problem of mail vs Mail directory.
Any comments on how to handle this?

One other potential problem: if you use xmh also there is a dot-file 
.xmhcache in each MH-directory/folder and various <msg-number>.CKP files. 
>From the mh-driver code I read that the delete-folder action only removes

I like the carefullness in the driver (don't delete the folder if there's 
any file not related to messages there but it should at least remove 
'well-known' MH-capable-client systemfiles (,<msg-number>, .mh_sequences, 
.xmhcache, <msg-number>.CKP).

It depends, if one decides to use pine and pine only to read the mail 
(and you let your kind sysadm remove all . , and CKP files once) there's 
no problem. If you decide to use various clients (pine, bare mh, xmh or 
even exmh) then you'll have to deal with the incompatibilities. I agree 
that potential problems should be documented (by the same kind sysadm or 
another volunteer ;-). 

Given bare mh or xmh pine has some major advantages: it's so easy to attach 
a gif-file or other MIME-file to the message and you can even read your 
news without learning yet another interface ! (Note that this is another 
"great job, pine team !"). Bare mh is definitely more flexible but on the 
easy-to-use scale mh doesn't do well....

Regards,

Xander

Are the index files for the addressbook platform independent?  Basically,
can I have one addressbook with one index file (.lu) that can handle
SunOS 4.X, Solaris, and HP-UX as well as possibly Linux and other things?

In Pine 3.90, you can have multiple addressbooks, so just configure one or
more global-address-book entries in your /usr/local/lib/pine.conf file...

Like everyone else, I think that Pine 3.90 is wonderful.  I use it on 
SunOS 4.1.3, HPUX 8.0 and soon on Linux.

Everything seems to work fine on both the Sun and HP.  However, on the HP 
if I have an xterm with 40 rows and 80 columns and try to Compose a 
message, pico only opens a window 24x80.  The help lines appear on lines 
23 and 24.  If I cancel, the cancel line it about on line 22 (I think).  
This is not a problem on the Sun.

When viewing message, the window size is recognized without a problem,
using the entire with to display the current message.  The index,
configure, and address book screens also use the entire window. 

I am using the same source (..tar.gz) for both.  The compiler on both is 
the default when you specify 'build sun' or 'build hpp'.  

If you have an suggestions, please let me know.

    Is there a way to change the default sort order, and email domain
    just for news folders?  I would like to make the news in Pine
    appear in a psuedo-threaded fashion (OrderedSubj).  I would also
    like a different email address to show up in the From: field, as
    my Internet email address differs from my internal (IBM) internet
    address.  When I send email, it gets translated for me, but when
    I post news, there is no such luck...Suggestions?

    This would be synonymous with setting HIDDENHOST for xrn or mxrn...

Thanks-

Just got the precompiled pine 3.90 and tried it and liked it.  Just one 
drawback that I'm still waiting for, to be able to have folder 
collections exist as a directory structure (I get a lot of mail and 
usually keep current quarters mail in ~/mail, but older mail goes in 
~/mail/old_mail/year/quarter" where year is the four digit year and 
quarter is q1-q4.  It would be nice if a subdirectory could be crossed as 
part of a folder collection.

I sure that I could add these subdirectories as additiional folder 
collections, but since they are in the same heirachey, it seem sthat they 
should just follow through to be intuitive.

Another request would be the ability to recognize compressed or gzipped 
mail folders and extract from them as well.  I'd be happy for this is a 
read only mode.

Other than those two, the new version is great and will boost its 
acceptance on our campus.  Just too bad it was posted to the ftp server 
one working day after our final introduction to UNIX when to the publisher!

Yes, that's supposed to work.  The index file is ASCII for that reason.  
It's even supposed to work from a PC, if you have some sort of remote 
file system.

Is there a way to automatically enter reading newsgroups from pine?  What
I'm basically asking is if there is a way to invoke pine with command line
options that will open up a newsgroup.

Tried:  pine -f "*{newsserver.put.here/nntp}[comp.mail.pine]"  

It looks like pine is going to open up the group however it comes back with
a 411 No Such Group error message.  Any ideas.

I found that Pine mailcap.c doesn't like blank lines, so that
it said my .mailcap from Mosaic was empty. Added a few ##, et voila!

I've only tried an .au file so far. The old mechanism of specifying
an image viewer still works; I haven't investigated whether
I get the xv/xloadimage split defined below.

FYI:

# This is a simple example mailcap file.

# This maps all types of audio data (audio/basic, audio/x-aiff,

Can the Wyse 50 do VT100 emulation?  If so, put a wrapper around pine so that
the appropriate control characters are sent to the Wyse 50 to put it into
VT100 mode before executing PINE.

Then, of course, after PINE is done, send the code to pop the terminal back
into Wyse 50 mode.  Add the appropriate delay in the script to give the terminal
time to switch modes.

This works for Wyse 60 terminals.

There is an error in the timezone generation code in the SGI port which will
cause erroneous time zones to be generated in the Date: header for all sites
whose local timezone is not GMT.

The symptom is that the Date: header looks like:
	Date: Wed, 31 Aug 1994 19:33:19 +48000
instead of the correct
	Date: Wed, 31 Aug 1994 19:33:19 -0800

This problem is most often noticed by

To fix this problem, please edit the file pine/imap/ANSI/c-client/os_sgi.c,
changing a line which reads:
  zone = _timezone;		/* get timezone from TZ environment stuff */
to be:
  zone = -_timezone / 60;	/* get timezone from TZ environment stuff */

A better fix may be this, but I'm not absolutely sure:
  zone = ((t->tm_isdst > 0) ? 60 : 0) - _timezone/60;

We apologize for this problem.

Hello.

We have received at least three bug reports claiming that entries in .newsrc
are being massively deleted by Pine on SUN-OS.  As yet, we've been unable to
reproduce the problem on our SUN-OS machine; nor has anyone reported this
problem on any other platform.  The people who have reported it seem fairly
insistant that it happens every time.

I've spent today staring at the code, and I remain pretty much mystified as to
how it could happen.

Has anyone else encountered this problem?  Has it happened on any system OTHER
than SUN-OS?  Is the news access local or via NNTP?  When you notice the
problem, is there a good copy in .oldnewsrc?

This problem is at the top of my list, and will remain there until it gets
solved.  We apologize to anyone who's been bit by it.

I recently compiled 3.90 for an sgi and found that when accessing the 
program from a remote terminal (a mac through a modem to our sgi) pine kept
complaining the ^Q was not a command. I'm pretty sure that this is not a 
problem with our modem because no changes were made with its setup and    
the next day, after running pine in a shell directly on the sgi, I used a library database 
program over the internet with a filter to save the transcript to a file. I
observed ^Q appearing at every prompt in the saved transcript, but not during 
the session. This seems to me to be a bit odd. Has anyone else had a similar 
experience? I seem to recall mention that some work was done on the term 
recognition portion of the program.

vt100 is not one of the emulation modes available on the WY-50. I wish it 
were. Would it be possible to remap the keys somehow, though?

   I send Email to a mail list. Usually I compose a text file on my PC 
and save it as text only with line breaks. I upload it and then 
incorporate it into an Email with the ^R command. I learned that I have 
to clean the file with the /u1/mirage/bin/dos2unix <filename> command to 
get rid of ^M at the end of lines. I do this now and the Email looks fine 
as I send it but the people who receive it have =20 at the end of every 
line except the line that ends a paragraph. This makes a real mess of my  
Emails. I sometimes break up my Emails with a string of ==== and these 
get messed up too. How can I fix this problem?
                                                      Thanks,

I want to add lines to my header.  And I have to admit I'm not a genius here. 
We apparently have pine 3.07 [wha wha wha wha (sound effect suggesting losing
on a game show.)]  Is there an easier way than suspending composition then 
editing the temporarily saved file?

It seems if we had 3.89 there would be a screen where I could do that.
I'm so sad.

Is there a way to tell pine to connect to an NNTP server that is not on 
the usual port 119?  I can't figure out the proper way to configure in 
the .pinerc (if there is a way to do so).
Thank You

Hello, 

I have a question about Pine startup. I have noticed that if my PPP 
connection is down Pine will hang and not start or, if the PPP connection 
is heavily loaded Pine is very slow to start up. All of my mail and 
sendmail files are on the local system so it shouldn't need to access the 
network. Can someone tell me how to fix this?

Thanks,

David

Buggered if I know. I'm the one that did the Linux compatibility for the
Pine 3.90 release, and all it needs is a "build lnx". It works on mine and
it works on other Linux machines.

Like someone else suggested, you could try "./build lnx" to make sure you're
running the right build program.
