Good Evening,

	I'm at the other end of a 64KB link to my NNTP server.

	When I go to read a newsgroup I get the notification saying
some thing like "comp.unix.solaris open with 44 messages" then a few seconds 
later I get the message "sorting comp.unix.solaris - 48% complete".  Well,
that last message stays on the screen until I issue a key stroke.

	We sometimes have problems with our leased line...so when this
first happened I thought it was just the line acting up and waited for
it to clear up....three hours later (sic) I hit the down arrow.......

Whilst trying to trace a display problem yesterday I successfully 
compiled Pine 3.90 "out of the box" on IRIX 4.0.5, IRIX 5.1.1.2 and IRIX 
5.2.  What problem are you seeing?

Ok, call me stupid, but I grabbed a pre-compiled Unix pine binary from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu and now I want to setup a pine.conf, so how do I 
get a copy of one to configure and put into my /usr/local/lib?

Am using Pine 3.90 under SunOS 4.1.3 and cannot get the tab filename 
completion to work while entering filenames in the attach header field or 
in the ^r read file prompt.  I can do it from my shell.

I have enabled this in the config and restart Pine :-)

        FEATURE: enable-tab-completion
 
This feature enables the TAB key when at a prompt for a filename. In this
case, TAB will cause the partial name already entered to be automatically
completed, provided the partial name is unambiguous.

We have "enable-suspend" in pine.conf.  I also tried adding this to my 
.pinerc, but no joy.

Interestingly enough, ^Z works in the our (Kerberized) AIX version of 
Pine....

Thanks for replying!

We'll add a check to make sure that the configured sendmail exists and is 
executable.  We don't want to wait for the completion status of sendmail 
since that can take a long time and many sendmails don't return a useful 
exit status anyway.  You should, however, get a bounce message mailed 
back to you (once we are sure we're talking to a sendmail).  Thanks for 
the suggestions!

What I have done in the end is make an alias that runs pine -d 0 when I

: 	You need to put the name of a "host" that is acting as an
: NNTP server.  Not your domain name.

Problem is I have a UUCP link with my host, so Pine returns and says cant 
make link with NNTP server or something like that..

What I need it to do is update my /var/spool/news directly as though the 
server was local?

Thanks,

In case anybody else wanted to know how to redirect the output from 'pine 
-conf'  into a file, i figured it out.  'pine -conf' only shows you a 
file, but the command  'cat | pine -conf >pine.conf'  seemed to work for 
me.  I am sure i went the long way around the problem, but hey, it works.

Using Pine3.90 on a DG/UX system we get occasional "New mailbox

this message using Pine3.87.  Can anyone suggest possible reasons for this

My guess is that the problem is due to the logging that was added in
imapd.  If the DNS is unhappy, this logging could slow things down.

Try rebuilding imapd, but with the syslog calls removed.  Actually, it 
may suffice just to disable the tcp_clienthost() function in tcp_unix.c 
by removing its code and putting in a
  return "???";
statement.

If the folder doesn't have too many pieces of mail, the user could alway ^R
and then ~/mail/foldername.
Of course it will end up with many other things not wanted, but using ^^ and
then ^W [from:] will be ease to eraese all unwanted mail...

convoluted, but it works... (I use this a couple of times...)

I might be wrong on this, but isn't there a way to get pine to 
use a speller program other than the UNIX spell program?  I would like
to use ispell-3.1.08.  What am i missing in the configuration?

You should be able to use the $REPLYTO variable in .pinerc or pine.conf 
for Unix Pine and PINERC for PC-Pine, e.g.

	customized-hdrs=Reply-To: $REPLYTO

I would like to send a mail to a group of people. This can be easily done 
by creating a list of recipients in the address book. The only problem is, 
that when the mail is sent, every recipient receives the letter with the list 
of all other recipients in the <To:> field of the message. When the list 
is getting larger, this is really annoying.

I am using Pine 3.9 on SGI. Is there any way to avoid this problem?

Thanks for any suggestions,

   Both the uploaded file incorporated into the message and the stuff I

You need to put your list in the "Bcc" field (Blind Carbon Copy) rather 
than the "To" field.  The idea of the Bcc field is to let you send 
messages to people and have the other recipient names omitted from each 
recipient's message (ie, the recipient only sees his/her own name).

You can get to the Bcc field by starting to compose a message, putting 
the cursor in the headers, and typing ^R (Rich Header).

If you use it a lot you could also add Bcc to the list of headers you are 
shown by default.  This is done in the Setup -> Configuration screen.  
(The variable you want is default-composer-hdrs ... check the built-in 
help for more details about this by placing your cursor on its entry in 
the configuration screen and requesting help).

The modem program was set to do XON/XOFF. I turned it off, but the 
problem persisted. It only happened when looking at something which 
scrolled off the bottom of the screen, such as when looking at the list 
of articles available in this news group. In addition I also got an error 
message that ^S was not a command. I don't recall that I got that before, 
but I certainly may have. Thanks for your help.

Pine should not have a problem with a pre-existing mail directory.  Could you
send details of your configuration, the errors you get, and what you have
tried to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu?

Hierarchical folder collection support is one of the big-ticket items on our
to-do list for the next 6 months or so.  We are also looking into the
possibility of some sort of compressed folder driver...

Subject: Pine/IMAPd problems on HP-UX
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I am having a problem with IMAPd on my HP9000/S800 server running HP-UX v9.  I 
retrieved and compiled the Pine-3.90 source from ...washington.edu.  Pine works 
great, I really like it (first time user).  I then pulled down PC-Pine and set 
up my PINERC (and .pinerc) files so that all my folders were stored on the HP 
server (so they were listed as remote from PC-Pine).

The problem is that many types of operations between PC-Pine and imapd will 
take 75-80 seconds.  Some of these operations include: loggin in, opening a 
folder, etc.  It doesn't always happen.

I thought it may be a problem with PC-Pine interacting with my Winsock stack.  
So, to test, I modified my .pinerc on the server where imapd runs, to 'fake it 
out' and make it run through imapd rather than locally.  I did this my setting 
the inbox to {hp-server.ctea.com}INBOX, the smtp-host, etc.

When I set up pine in this manner, it behaves exactly like PC-Pine (although 
the unix-hosted pine UA doesn't beep and give the ...waiting... messages).

In all cases, the operations do work, they just take 75-80 seconds.

This leads me to believe it's an imapd problem.  Has anyone seen this problem 
before?  Is there any HP9000S800 users out there that could send me an imapd 
executable that does not exhibit this problem?

Thanks to all for their time and efforts.

Both Pine 3.89 and 3.90 support the "-p" command line option to specify

I believe the MiNT port is for the preliminary work that was done on a Mac
port of Pine.  Certainly it is c-client only, no MiNT work has been done on
Pico or Pine that I know of...

Pine 3.90 won't start up if you have a non-directory file called "mail" in
your home directory, even if you have your folder-collections set to
something else (in my case, .mail/[]).  If you remove this file, and it
starts up, it won't mistakenly create a directory or anything.  I guess the
check for this should be moved to the point that it knows what name to use...

There is a possibility you are experiencing an rsh timeout.  Try setting your
inbox to {hp-server.ctea.com:143}INBOX which will avoid trying to use rsh
pre-authentication.

Hi all

I just downloaded Pine 3.90 and tried to build it on VMS. I had no 
problems in the [.PICO] and [.C-CLIENT] directories, but in the [.PINE] 
directory, there is no VMSBUILD.COM file. Has anybody tried to build Pine 
on VMS, and if so, could you pass along your .COM file to me?

Thanks much,

There are a couple ways to use Ispell with Pine.  Check the FAQ posted

The sample mailcap file was indeed left out of the distribution.  The
/etc/imapdrc and ~/.imapdrc files are not needed except in very exceptional
configurations.  At this time we would prefer to discuss your need to use
them individually rather than publish the specification.

Since most of the people will use a nick or alias for the email address of a 
mailing list (such like fvwm=fvwm@shrug.org), would it be a feature that Pine
can look up the addressbook before completing the address.

The primary ftp site for Pine is ftp.cac.washington.edu.  Look in the /pine
directory.  Pine 3.90 has been available less than a week, so it may not have
propagated to all mirrors yet.

These exist, but are intentionally undocumented; they shouldn't be used by
non-UW sites and shouldn't be referenced in the tech notes.  I suspect
that their functionality is useless for 99.9% of all Pine sites.  They
exist to support certain experimental facilities at UW and are not for
non-UW use (at least not yet).  These capabilities are *extremely* 
dangerous and are used only by certain dedicated IMAP server machines.

These files and the commands in them are subject to change without notice. 
Meaning you can depend upon some capability and then upgrade and find that
all your mail has disappeared.

If you're really curious, I have a document which says what goes in these 
files, but you've been fairly warned...

	Not a very good idea.  First of all most responsible mailing list
administrators make sure that they send out FQDN so that replies and such
will be easier on people.  Then, the nick name you assign needs to be
exactly the same as the mailing list address.  The idea of a nickname is
to shorten things.  When sending to pine-info..... I'd much rather assign
it a name of pine.  And what happens if there are two lists with the same
left-hand side?

Subject: MIME compose in pine ??
Date: 2 Sep 1994 00:38:53 GMT
Message-Id: <345s6t$poj@nntp.ucs.ubc.ca>

OK, so now Pine uses .mailcap to read mail. But the compose is a bit of
a kludge. send.c in 3.90 pokes around in the file and decides if it's
a GIF, JPEG, audio/basic or PostScript file. There's also some checks
to see if it looks like a binary file (from some spreadsheet ??).

How about using .mime.types like Mosaic to map file extensions to
application types? I can specify Mosaic as a viewer for HTML attachments
I receive, but I can't send any, unless there's some way of overriding
the type/subtype I haven't discovered.

I've been receiving this message as well. I've looked at my mailbox 
listings, but the files have not changed. We're also on DG/UX 5.4.201.

Please say it isn't so.  No programs should use any of the bsd src
compatibility cruft.  There is serious brain damage lurking.

If there is only one module that needs porting then it should be fixed.

I am running a DEC 3000-600 with OSF/1 v. 2.0.  I have installed PINE 
3.90 and really like it.  However, I ran into an interesting situation in 
using the user-domain setting in the .pinerc or pine.conf files.  When I 
set the user-domain to my full address  coopext.cahe.wsu.edu, in either 
file, pine would strip off the hostname when I sent to a local id on the 
system.  For example, if I sent it to me, 

TO:  boyerj

it would add the address

boyerj@cahe.wsu.edu

When user-domain was not set in both the .pinerc and pine.conf files the 
correct address would appear

boyerj@coopext.cahe.wsu.edu

Am I reading the purpose of user-domain wrong?  I thought it would use 
the user-domain on local addresses?

Anybody that can help me understand this I would greatly appreciate it.

Note:  I did test this on another test alpha we have with the same results.

Thanks for the help,

	I just grabbed Pine 3.90 and compiled it here.  It's fabulous.  
The newsreader is really great, and the Setup module is wonderful.  But...

	How can I set a default sort preference for both my mail folder 
(say, newer messages at the top, like in elm), and then a preference for 
my news folder (sorted by subject)?  I can change it everytime I go in, 
but am not sure how to make this permanent.
	
	Also, will anything ever be done with the arrow keys?  When 
viewing a message, it would really be nice to hit the left arrow and get 
to the index, or hit the down arrow at the end of a message and get the 
next message.  Just something to make life easier.

Andrew,
We had hoped to get mime.types support into 3.90, but didn't make it.
It should be in the next non-maintenance release.

Great. I've just started using Pine on Linux after years of VAX/VMS mail, 
so I was playing with all the things I couldn't previously do, like
multimedia attachments

Date: 2 Sep 1994 03:16:58 GMT
Message-Id: <3465fa$r68@garuda.csulb.edu>

In pine 3.88 I made a short local configuration change (provided by David
L. Miller) to get pine to grab the users mail from the spool and put it in
~/mbox, if such a file already existed.

This was a simple 2 line change to pine.c in previous versions, but after a
quick grep thru the source tree, it looks like its not as obvious a change
as last time.

This was the previous diff on pine.c
wren:~/tmp/pine3.88/pine $ diff pine.c pine.c~

<     mail_link((DRIVER *)&mboxdriver);

Any suggestions as to what to change in pine 3.90 to get the same effect?

[ I'm not a MIME expert, so if I'm just misinterpreting the RFC,
  please forgive me. This is the first time I've tried constructing
  one by hand, and that took me a couple of tries to get it exactly
  right. ]


When I send myself the following file, what Pine displays as 
the list of parts is:

Subject: Mime multipart/digest test message
Parts/attachments:
   1   Shown    6 lines  Text, "Part one of MIME test message" 
   2   Shown  144 bytes  Message, "This part of the test message is content ty
   2.1 Shown    3 lines  Text 
   3   Shown    8 lines  Text, ""This is the third and last part of the test m
   4   Shown    3 lines  Text 
----------------------------------------

[ Please ignore that "third and last" above. I added part 4 later. ]

  I thought that for Content-type: multipart/digest, the default
  for each part was message/rfc822, not text. [ rfc1521 ]


| 7.2.4.     The Multipart/digest subtype
|
|   This document defines a "digest" subtype of the multipart Content-
|   Type.  This type is syntactically identical to multipart/mixed, but
|   the semantics are different.  In particular, in a digest, the default
|   Content-Type value for a body part is changed from "text/plain" to
|   "message/rfc822".  This is done to allow a more readable digest
|   format that is largely compatible (except for the quoting convention)
|   with RFC 934.


The attachment list above lists all the parts as Text, except for the
one part that has an explicit Context-type: message-rfc822 header.

I suppose the general escape clause that message/rfc822 is a subtype
of text, and that if you don't understand a text subtype, it's
reasonable to treat it (more-or-less) as test/plain, could be a 
justification.


Part 2 ( the one with the explicit Content-type: message/rfc822 
header ) is doubly listed as :
   part 2    Message, the body of which shows includes the headers,
   part 2.1  Text, the body of which does not contain the rfc822 
       headers, only the message body text. 


Is this double listing a side effect of Justification #1 above ? 


On the positive side: 

This was a test that was a followup to my post about using MIME 
multipart/digest for mailing list digests. I wanted to see 
what Pine did with one BEFORE suggesting enhancements. 

Although Pine does initially display all of the text sections 
"inline" , you can still select a message from the view attachment
list. If a digester puts something into the Content-Description:
like  '(From:) subject', it makes a reasonable way to look thru
a large digest. One can then save the message into a file which
can be opened as a folder ( at least with Pine I was able to 
do so. It is missing a bsd-mbox "From " line, so it may not be 
considered a mail folder by non c-client programs. ) and a REPLY
to that extracted message worked properly. 

So, while I'ld like *better* support for Messages in Pine, the
existing functionality still beats having to unpack an entire
digest to individually reply to one message. 

What I'ld *like* to see is something like a MIME multipart/digest
driver for c-client, so that a multipart/digest could be 
treated just like another folder. ( I don't know if such a 
recursive use of Pine is possible. ) 


It would also be nice if other messages from a folder could 
be attached without first having to extract them to a file. 


I also note that in trying to reply to a multipart message, when 
I ask to include the message in my reply, it only includes the
initial section. I assume that this is intentional: so that 
people don't unintentionally include large attachments. 
( Not necessarily complaining here: If you aren't going to 
  provide any options, attaching only part one is probably 
  the better thing to do. ) 


[ Pine 3.90 is really great, guys! However, now that it's twice 
  as usable as 3.89, I'm using it four times as often. ( If it
  only had mush's 'pick' or some equivalent!!! ) So you may 
  actually get MORE requests for features, etc. ;-) ]

What you need to do is start up an NNTP server on your machine, then point
Pine at localhost.  A bit convoluted, but I don't see why it won't work...

Hello!

I discovered last night the pine3.90. Compiled it and it's great!
Congratulations to the developing team!!

However I have three questions/ideas:

* is there any method to define a kill file for newsgroups? You can't
use something like procmail to filter them.

* once Dismissed and eXpunged a news article I didn't found any method
to review that article (or to see again all the articles still
available on the news server for that group).

* I can access a news server which is not very rich in newsgroups.
But I have another account on a machine in a completely different site,
which is allowed to connect to a there local news server which is much
richer in newsgroups. The direct connection with the rich news server
from the machine I work daily is refused by the server.

The question: is there a possibility to use the richer news server
using my remote account without starting pine on the remote machine? I
mean using imapd or alike?

Again congratulations for the good work you've done,

Mihai Lazarescu

I susbscribe to a mail list from which my messages are in digest form,
usually two messages of about 30-40 messages each per day; I was wondering
if anybody has written a script or program for Pine that will allow me
to "break-out" my long digest messages into separate messages, and then
treat them as I would other e-mail messages?  Somebody sent me a script
that will do this for the Elm program, but Elm isn't available here.

Actually, I hadn't yet tried all of the new functions out, and I 
misunderstood how SELECT works. It looks like SELECT and APPLY 
give me just about the same capability as mush 'pick'. And used
with ZOOM, it may even be better!

I'm CC-ing this to the list, as there may be a few other dense 
souls like me out there, who may take some time to discover all
the neat new features. Also, Re: the filter FAQ thread : 
Perhaps discovering that they can SELECT a group of messages 
and APPLY SAVE to another folder to that group, will satisfy 
them. It's not automatic, like filter/procmail - but I agree
that a MUA is not the place for automatic filtering. ] 

Up to now, I've been maintaining Pine here for other users, 
and maybe only using it myself  15% of the time. ( For imap
& mime support ). It now looks, with 3.90 and BOUNCE/SELECT/
APPLY/PIPE/ZOOM, plus all of the new configuration options,
that I can finally accept Pine as my everyday mailreader! 

Did I mention that I also like the way TAKE-ADDRESS works now.
Also that rich-header mode in compose gives you newsgroups as
well as mail destinations, so I can reply to a mailing list and
"cc" a newsgroup. 

Even *MORE* impressed! 
( Like they say in the commercial "It's IN there!" ) 


Just one minor complaint. ( Well - just one non MIME related
complaint! ). 

Not to forget needs of the novice user, with all those new 
advanced features: 
 I have notices that some commands ( BOUNCE for one example )
 have a "^G Get Help" at the bottom of the screen, but there
 is not help for that command. But what is bad is that it 
 doesn't say "no help available", it just sits there and 
 looks unresponsive. ( Which is why I don't recall the  
 commands before BOUNCE where this happened - I just kept 
 trying to get help, and the ^C-ed out. ) - Confusing!

Definitely a bug!  Please let us know if you see any other commands missing 
their help text besides Bounce...

Well, this is not what you want, but following up on my other thread:

I tried editing the header of a mail digest and adding these lines:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="----------------------------"

and reading it back:
  (1) boundary  is unlikely to be exactly the same in all mail digests. 
  (2) It wasn't exactly the same even within the one I tried, so it 
      only almost worked. The first boundary was longer. And MIME 
      expects the last one two have an extra  trailing "--" . 

But, again - it mostly worked, and didn't require undigesting 
the whole digest. So if I were going to write a script, rather
than an "undigester", I'ld write a digest->MIME multipart/digest
converter. ( But, typically the problem is, mailing list managers
and programs tend to be notorious non-followers of standard and
convention, so I don't know if there is a consistant enough pattern
to do either the undigest or the mime-ify automatically. I'll 
have to collect a sample from several digests. 
Mush's undigest allows you to specify the pattern to split on. 
( I think elm does also ) The default is 8*"-" as an initial string. 
Both of them can sometimes mis-split messages.

Ok, I need some help trying to make what I want to do work corrently.

Here it goes:

I have a "Distribution List" that I would like to run.  I have around 20 
names or so in Pine's Addressbook under one alias.  What I want to 
happen, is that when someone sends a message to iCE@cloud9.net (the 
list's address), that it takes that message, and sends it to all 20 
people definied in the addressbook alias.  Is there any way to do this 
using Pine?  I'm using Pine 3.90.  If you tell me the solution is filter, 
can you tell me where I can find the Elm Filter Guide?  Thanks.

Hi,

I have recently installed the lastest version of Ispell 3.1.8 to replace 
the less advanced, GNU (discontinued) version 4.0.  But I find that the new 
version cannot act as a direct replacement for the GNU one and is not 
working properly with PINE.  I would like to know if there are things 
that I should fine-tune before using this new version.  Thanks.

Keith

P.S.  I am running Linux 1.1.49 here.

I just tried to throw together a Python program that would 
convert mail digests in somewhat standard form into MIME
multipart/digest messages with From + Subject fields concatenated
into the Content-Description: header of each part. 

I was tearing my hair out trying to figure out why it didn't
quite work. ( and I don't have that much to spare! )-: 

It *LOOKED* like a proper MIME file! 

One odd clue, though, was that Pine was displaying the headers 
oddly - with a blank line in the middle of the headers. 
( The blank line wasn't in the file! ) 

Then I stumbled upon the fact that sending the modified file
back to myself via 'sendmail -ba'  seemed to fix it. (?) 

When I extracted the message I was going to mimeify with mush 
instead of Pine, the procedure also worked. 

I tried dumping the message from Pine with SAVE rather than
EXTRACT ( which is what I must have first used. ) - YES.
Than also worked. 

Unfortunately, the PIPE command seems to do the same thing as
EXTRACT ( i.e. only output a subset of the headers. ), so 
I can't pipe a message to this digest2mime script. 

I had noted the difference between SAVE and EXTRACT before, 
but I recall in one of the earlier versions of Pine, it 
wouldn't let you open something that wasn't a proper folder. 

In this case, I am able to open the file as a folder, and 
get an index of it's contents ( 1 message ), but something
keeps it from being interpreted as a proper MIME message -
or maybe even as a proper Mail message. 


With full headers off, there is a empty line displayed after
a Subject: line containing the file name. This line is not
in the file, and there is a real Subject line below the 
blank line ( which is also not in the file at that place,
but is in the pine display ) which appears to be not 
properly interpreted as part of the headers. ( This is 
also the problem with proper MIME interpretation: when
I turn on full headers, there are two sets of MIME-Version
and Content-Type headers: the incorrect ones that Pine is
adding on the top, and the correct ones below. ) 


The display looks like this:

[ PINE 3.90   MESSAGE TEXT <Mail> xxxx.mime.tmp(READONLY)  Msg 1 of 1 ]

Date: Sat, 3 Sep 1994 02:54:43 +0000
From: sdm7g@elvis.med.Virginia.EDU
Subject: /home/sdm7g/.Mail/xxxx.mime.tmp

From: List-Managers-Digest-Owner@GreatCircle.COM
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="--------next-message-" 
Subject: List Managers Digest V3 #149


and what is actually in the file is:

>From List-Managers-Digest-Owner@GreatCircle.COM
Date: Wed, 17 Aug 1994 01:10:08 -0700
From: List-Managers-Digest-Owner@GreatCircle.COM
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="--------next-message-" 
Subject: List Managers Digest V3 #149


If I try a REPLY, it appears to extract the From: line 
into the composer screen properly, so it seems to be 
considered *some* sort of message. Could it be being 
interpreted as a NEWS message rather than a Mail message,
( even though it's in my Mail folder ) because of some
missing header line. 

And what is the significantly missing line ? 

Can PIPE and EXPORT be configured to output the 
necessary lines ?

In Pine 3.90, you can add the mbox driver by simply adding it to the 
build command line, e.g.

You can actually get to both, assuming the remote site has imapd 
installed.  In the Setup/Config screen set

	news-collections="Local News"	*{localserver/nntp}[],
			 "Remote News"	*{remoteserver}[]

then restart Pine.  The "Local News" collection will access the local server
via NNTP and use the .newsrc file on the local machine.  The "Remote News"
collection will access news on the remote system via IMAP and use the .newsrc
file on the remote machine.

Here's a Python script to convert digests with "\n--------" 
message separators into a mime Content-type: multipart/digest
message.

[ Python info: <http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/python/index.html> 
  or <news:comp.lang.python> ] 

A MIME-aware mail-reader like Pine, for example, shows the 
single messages as attachments:

----------------------------------------


However, you can't reply to an attached message from Pine. 


And saveing the attachment to a file and opening it as a folder 
also doesn't seem to work. ( This is due to the same SAVE vs EXPORT
problem I reported to comp.mail.pine in an earlier message. 
The Viewer menu has a "SAVE" but it works like "EXPORT" in the
other command set.  I had reported earlier that this DID work,
but that must have been incorrect. I had simulated some of the
process "by hand" and I must have done some extra header munging
that I had forgotten. ) 

If I can find a fix for those problems, the proper procedure
would probably be to also add a CC: to-the-list to each 
individual message header to make reply work better. 

Pine for example, will ask if you wish to reply to all recipients -
YES would include addresses on the CC: header as well as the 
From: or Reply-to: address. 
( mush has reply | replyall forms, but it's not MIME aware, so 
  this wouldn't work. ) 


Are there any other conventions I ought to know about to make
this scheme work properly ? ( However, my impression is that
among mailing lists, conventions and standards are not widely 
honoured. )

You can set a single default sort order for all folders by setting the
"sort-key".  We will probably implement the left-right keys when we work on
hierarchical folder collections later this year...

Pine won't do it automatically, but you can use the Pipe (|) command to pass
a message through uudecode...

You can set Pine up to do this from the Setup screen.  Select alternate 
printer and enter uudecode as the printer.  Then, when you wish to 
uudecode the z>yfile, just select it and hit y for printer, y again to 
say that you really meant y in the first place, and d to delete the 
message (unless you really don't want to).

That's as close as I've found thus far.

is a great programmer and a fine person.)

FYI: 

That command did not lead in an open folder related to
"comp.mail.pine" !!! Pine actually did open it but I could
not *see* it.


Therefor, I used 'g' and gave the following address and
then it opened it up:
*{newsserver/nntp}comp.mail.pine

So, what's the point of that command line
if you have to retype the newsgroup-folder name?


At any rate, it's fine by me....

The PINE directory was not ported to VMS yet. I am working on it and will
announce the availability on this list when I am done.

This problem is probably common to most European sites using Pine.
Pine 3.90 is indeed a wonderful mail-program, and in fact the only feature
we are missing is the ability to switch quoted-printable on/off. At least
in the Nordic countries many sites are using MTAs that are capable of
handling 8bit coded mail. Turning QP off will then be quite safe.

I hope the Pine development team will consider this as a future 
enhancement.

Meanwhile, I hope Peter Svanberg will share his patch with us, giving
notification to this newsgroup.

	No, posting was not part of 3.89.  You'll have to upgrade to
3.90 for that feature.

FYI....

	It *works* as advertised for me.

	You did type:

pine -f "*{foo.bar.com/nntp}comp.mail.pine"

	and not literally

pine -f "*{newserver/nntp}comp.mail.pine"  ???

I have discovered that (on this system, at least) if the "user-domain" is
set to my system's host name in pine.conf, pine.conf.fixed, or .pinerc,
PINE does not assign the correct domain name to local addresses that are
not in the address books.  If "user-domain" is not set, everything is
fine, though. 

My user-domain was set in pine.conf.fixed to "scan.si.edu" (the system's
full name).  When I addressed mail to the account "test", which is not in
any of my address books, but is an account on the system, the composer
translated it as "test.si.edu".  (I also tried using "si.edu" as the domain
name, and got the exact same result.)  The mail bounced.

Setting "user-lookup-even-if-domain-mismatch" solved this problem. 
Unsetting user-domain did as well.  

I'm glad that the solution was so simple, but I don't understand why PINE
behaved as it did when the user-domain variable had been set to what should
be the correct value.  This should not constitute a "domain mismatch",
should it?  Or am I missing something?  It seems to me that this anomaly
could cause problems on many systems.  If the user-domain variable should be
left blank in a plain-vanilla setup like mine, shouldn't this be made clear
in the help text?

I'm running PINE 3.90 under DYNIX/ptx 1.3.1 and ptx/TCP/IP 2.2.4.  
(The PINE distribution doesn't include the complete port for PTX 1.x, but
it's not especially difficult to fix.)

Does anyone here have any scripts to simplify using PGP with pine.
(pine 3.9 on sun os ver 4)

All of the scripts I've found so far, work only with elm and emacs.

If someone knows how to redirect the sent messages to an alternate 
mailer, (other than sendmail) that would work also.

Thanks in advance.

Is it possible to attach a tiff file like a fax and then be able to view

thanks in advance.

I also noticed the same problem (as I am sure several others have).  The
trick is to set "use-only-domain-name" to be "Yes", and then set
"user-domain" to be "hostname-domain" (eg. coopext.cahe.wsu.edu).

This seems to work for me.

try using the pico from pine 3.89heb as your alternate header

Me too. We have QP problem too here in Taiwan with Chinese using BIG5. I
have to modify the source code by myself to disable the qp-filter, otherwise 
the recipients who have no Pine could not see my chinese mail but a lot of 
"strange" codes instead.

>Meanwhile, I hope Peter Svanberg will share his patch with us, giving

I have modified the source code to disable the qp-filter with a little change
and worked fine for me.

At line 3804 of file send.c under the pine directory, comment out the filter:
   /* gf_link_filter(gf_8bit_qp); */
and at line 3860 of the same file above, replace the "ENCQUOTEDPRINTABLE" with 
"ENC8BIT".

I have no any side effect so far. If there was, please let me know.

I have never done so personally, but it should work, assuming you have your

Sure... It's because there are "over 5 zillion" things on the Pine todo

Even though I can't reproduce it on our system, it sounds like you guys
have found a bug in 3.90...  It should not be necessary to set
"use-only-domain-name" if you have already set "user-domain".

We'll look into it further...

Subject: readonly folder ?
Date: 4 Sep 1994 18:02:02 -0300
Message-Id: <andrea.778712258@pX1.stfx.ca>

What makes pine think a folder is readonly ?

I've got a pile of messages to copy from one machine to another
(from vms actually), i will move the files are root into a person's
mail directory then change ownership and protections.
But during testing, the files i've moved show up by the user as readonly
folders.
The data itself looks ok, the conversion program says that it conforms
to the appropriate rfc and in fact it looks pretty good. I can't see
anything that would cause the file to be readonly.
The protections are set ok, and the user can delete the folder file,
even berkley mail will delete the folder with no problem.

i'm using pine 3.90 on aix 3.2.5

please mail directly as i don't often read this group.

Can somebody recommend a good DOS or Windows application that will do

Thanks for reply...

I typed:


pine -f "*{news.unm.edu/nntp}comp.mail.pine"


Then I saw:


Opening "*{news.unm.edu/nntp}comp.mail.pine"..



Then I saw this menu:

 PINE 3.90   MAIN MENU Folder: news.unm.edu/nntp}comp.mail.pine  18 Messages

But what would one do from here?


The "L" line is high-lighted and when selected, it'll just 
open up the INBOX.

	Type "i".  This will bring you to the "Index" and you can " View 
messages in current folder".  As an alternative you could include the -i
switch in your command line and it would bring you directly to the
index.

if this IS possible, is it also possible to do it with a POP3 server?  my
roommate is running Linux on his pc and wants to use Pine to read mail
that comes into hsi account on Cornell's popmail server...

Hi


I am trying to compile pine vs 3.9 on an SGI system (Iris vs 5.1) with
little success. I tried both build sgi  and  build sv4.

Has anybody done this, and if so, what is needed?

Thanks

Chris

Riki,
It depends on the IMAP server, but try the following:

  inbox-path={mailserver}~/Inbox

Erik,
Pine does not yet directly support the "offline" mail processing model
(using either POP or IMAP), however, there is software available for Unix
that can make any mailer a POP client.  See the message below.

   There is currently a program called popclient in the sunsite.unc.edu/pub/
   Linux/Incoming directory.  It is not a mail reader.  It retrieves the 
   mail using POP2 or POP3.  You can then use pine or elm to read the mail.

Well, at least it's not there now.  Try sunsite.unc.edu//pub/Linux/system/

Pine 3.90, after displaying a full screen of the index of the current
inbox folder, the vt100 terminal display beeps, and displays in quick
succession "Command "^S" is not defined here", and then "Command "^Q" is
not defined here".  This occurs on practically all screen rewrites, at
least from the index display of the inbox. In fact in the setup, 
configuration section things become unmanageable because of the frequency 
of undefined keystrokes being received...though these keystrokes are not 
originating on my keyboard.

Dan,
Here's the scoop:

We got tired of getting bug reports of the form "Pine just froze up",
so we changed 3.90 so that it would trap XOFF/XON characters, rather than 
having XOFF silently cause everything stop working.

Unfortunately, on systems that rely on software flow-control, this results
in the symptoms you described.  In the upcoming 3.91 maintenance release
this will be a configuration option.  Until then, Mike S. advises that
deleting the two lines

        _raw_tchars.t_startc = -1;      /* Turn off ^S/^Q */
        _raw_tchars.t_stopc  = -1;

from around line 244 in pine/ttyin.c will make Pine 3.90 behave like 
previous versions.

-teg

p.s. we believe that this change also accounts for *some* of the problems
folks have reported with printing in 3.90 --however, PC comm server
software limitations and printer mis-configuration problems still account 
for most Pine printing problems.

Already working on a maintenance release for PINE 3.9x?  Now that's what 
I call SERVICE!

Any idea when it might come out and what's scheduled for inclusion (other 
than the XON/XOFF fix)?  Any chance that the user-domain issues will be 
cleared up?

This was nice! It works fine here, but there is yet another irritating
(mis)feature: If the first few characters in a document are 8bit, then the
whole document is encoded as BASE64, which is even less readable than qp :-(

Any fixes?

Why is it that the "From:" line can't be tweaked with 3.90, at least
not with the 3.90 binaries on ftp.cac.washington.edu (I could hack the
source, certainly)?  I'd think that anyone who consciously added a
"From:" line to customize-hdrs in their .pinerc would probably have a
good reason, and it's not like people couldn't corrupt their headers
easily enough by munging user-domain.  Pine isn't like some of the
obnoxious Mac and PC software "out there" which provides a "From:"
line just to cause confusion.

My config. is SparcStations 1, monochrome screen, 16MB RAM.

I have pine 3.90  now but I would appreciate some help.

I would like to make pine avaliable to my users, however we
have mmdf style mail boxes here, and I don't want users saving
mail in folders in mbox format, or any of the other formats
pine can handle.  Is it possible to configure pine to save mail in mmdf style
format and no other ? I would be nice if it could read in any format but
only save in mmdf style but if pine could only read mmdf style that
 would'nt be a problem.

Thanks

Subject: Append validity confusion Bug in PINE 3.90
Date: 5 Sep 1994 09:21:07 GMT
Message-Id: <34enu3$nf@styx.uwa.edu.au>


Bug report for PINE 3.90 

System: DOS 5.0, PC-NFS 5.0, PC-NFS Pine 3.90
Symptom1:
Pine crashes when attempting to save in "sentmail" (with outgoing mail) and
"savemail" in \MAIL area with  'Append validity confusion' Bug report. The
file "sentmail" is created (even though this should be "sentmail.mtx")
but Pine crashes. If outgoing mail is not saved there is no problem (unless
you attempt to save mail to "savemail"). 
Symptom2: 
Once "sentmail" is created Pine complains it can't save outgoing mail to folder
"sentmail" because it exists.
Symptom3:
The "sentmail" folder is not listed when listing folders.

Comment1:
No such problem existed with PC-PINE 3.89. Neither does there seem to be
any problems with the UNIX version of Pine 3.90.

I'll test this is out a bit more thoroughly but maybe somebody knows of an
obvious environment/configuration setting that must be made.

Thanks,

I use Yarn, you can find it on any SimTel Mirror in the directory `offline`
It does News and Mail offline.
On your Unix Host you'll need uqwk, a little programm that collects
your news and mail and will also post the Files that YARN generates.
YARN and uqwk work with the SOUP format.

See also the alt.usenet.offline-reader FAQ.

Hi,

has anyone compiled Pine 3.90 for Unixware and/or NCR SVR4?  

I was able to compile for NCR, but cannot get "folder listing" correctly
and Pine does not identify any of the folders in mail/[].

Thanks in advance,

Hi,
	I tried to use the setup option on the main menu of my pine in order to
upgrade my pine to version 3.90. For some reason, the response I get is a
request for my login and password, which, expectedly, fail.
	What's wrong?

There were postings about this bug over the last few days [sorry I have 
lost the thread].  It has to do with the Solaris version, in which Pine 
signals an abort when quitting with certain combinations of options set.

We had this problem but have solved it by a recompilation.  Our local
Solaris guru, Rob McMahon, tells me it is caused by code which rewrites
string constants, a practice which used to be OK but is no longer
recommended.  The work-round was to set the -fwritable-strings option for
the Gnu C compiler (gcc), which makes gcc revert to the "traditional" 
behaviour in this respect.

While I'm here, I'd like to add my compliments to all the others the Pine
team are getting for the tremendous job they have done with the new
features in 3.90.  Many thanks! 

Alan

As comments are collected for Pine 3.91, please include this regret for 
the shift from 3.89's "file exists, append [y/n]" format to 3.90's 
admittedly more logical (but +much+ more dangerous) choice of A(ppend) or 
O(verwrite).  At least, the O(verwrite) branch should require or 
optionally be configurable with a confirmation.

Maybe it is confirgurable to require a confirmation.  If so, +please+ let 
me know so I stop replacing yesterday's great stuff with today's trash :-(.

Has anyone hacked up pine to use "magic cookie" terminals (i.e. terminals that
use up a character position to change to/from highlight or underline mode) ?
We have many such terminals round the University (mostly Televideo or Wyse,
but some others too), and pine seems completely broken on them.

Apologies if this is a "FAQ", it's the first time I've subscribed to this
group.

Cheers,

Yes, I have also modified the send.c to disable ENC7BIT and ENCBINARY encoding
in the body of mail and make sure the content-transfer-encoding is 8BIT.

At line 3262 of file send.c, 
replace "new_encoding = ENC7BIT;" with "new_encoding = ENC8BIT;"
At line 3288 of file send.c,
replace "new_encoding = ENCBINARY;" with "new_encoding = ENC8BIT;"

We would like to run PINE on a HP 735 workstation running HP-UX version 
9.04.  Does anyone know where we can obtain a clean copy copy of the 
source code or a compiled version of the code?  Thank you.

I managed to get it working on Motorola SVR4.0 after some hacking 
(changing the definition of gettimeofday() helps a lot!)

this is because there are two directory access libraries which are subtly 
different.  To get around this I used cc (_not_ /usr/ucb/cc) and defined 
dirent as being the preferred directory structure.  After I recompiled it 
worked fine.
Cheers,

There have been lots of discussion about whether Pine should use
<Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit> header instead of QUOTED-PRINTABLE
if chosen so. My opinion is that there *definitely _should_ be* a
way to do this because now some newsreaders can't handle postings
made by Pine v3.90.

Here's an example: In the Nordic countries we quite commonly use
8-bit ISO-8859-1 character set and one of the most popular newsreaders
is Tin v1.2 PL12. When posting Finnish/Swedish/German/French 8-bit
text with Pine, it is quite impossible to read the messages using Tin
or other more versatile newsreaders. The screen is full with =E4/=F6
etc. stuff and people are furious.

So at least Tin and Pine 3.90 are *not* compatible with each other.
I know there are problems with other newsreaders, too. I'm quite sure
that people will not start using Pine for news posting _until_ someone
fixes this problem - a problem which is reality in Finland, Sweden, 
Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Germany, France and other countries using
International character sets.

Every time in my life that I've ever answered a question about software 
schedules I've lived to regret it, so let's just say "sooner rather than 
later".

There's a bunch of reported problems already fixed, and another bunch 
that still need to be... things like not allowing colons in the custom
header definitions, crashing when you reference a MIME External reference
or attach a non-existent message to the bug report command...

> Any chance that the user-domain issues will be cleared up?

Yes, if we figure out what's broken in time (recall that it doesn't seem 
to be misbehaving on our development system.)

Mike,
In 3.90 there is a compile-time option to permit this.

Letting everyone tweak their From: line is not enabled by default 
because, alas, not everyone has the same kind of clientele that you do 
(wherein anyone who modifies their From: line has a *good* reason...)

David,
Could you be more specific?

Based on reports from others, a performance bug related to marking 
messages Deleted has been found and fixed, but we'll need much more 
specific data from you in order to try to help...

It could be the signature file.  Try it with ".signature" instead of

Also, you can manually add your signature at the end of the mail
by control-r and then typin the signature file.

Hope this helps.

Hi, I use a feature of elm called filter and it works great.  It filters 
all my incoming mail, and can forward selected mail items also!  

But I use Pine to read my mail.  Once filter is setup, it is all 
invisible and works great.  email me if you want more info, or tell me if 
there is some problem with filter that I don't know of, and that procmail 
solves.

I understand in Pine how to sort the _message_ index within a folder.  

but what I want to do is sort the _folder_ index itself, and I can't see 
how to do that.  Can someone explain it to me?  thanks,

OK, my patch is now avaliable from

   ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/pub/pine-3.90-patch-8bit.txt

(which means FTP to ftp.nada.kth.se, get the file
/pub/pine-3.90-patch-8bit.txt.)

Patches to pine 3.90
====================

These are patches to get the following:

* Correction to the when-to-QP-encode code: The 30% limit must be
  paired with a lower length limit, or else very short letters could
  mysteriously sometimes be BASE64-encoded, because of a too high
  non-ASCII character ratio. (For getting just this correction, see
  the changes to line 3263-3266 in send.c.)

* New command line parameters:

  -use qp [0 or 1]	Use MIME encoding quoted printable for text,
			not 8-bit. (Default XX, 0=no, 1 or [none]=yes.)
  -mime_8 [0 or 1]	If text contains 8-bit text, use
			MIME. (Default YY, 0=no, 1 or [none]=yes.)

* New config parameters (on which the XX and YY defaults above
  depends): 

	DEFAULT_NOT_USE_QUOTED_PRINTABLE - Corresponds to "-use_qp 0"

  Enable this *only* if your sending software have the ESMTP 8BITMIME
  extension avaliable and enabled. (See RFC 1425 and RFC 1426.)

	DEFAULT_USE_NON_MIME_8BIT_LOCALLY - Corresponds to "-mime_8 0"

  Enable this *only* if your sending software transforms messages to
  7-bit before sending them outside your domain, or if it transforms
  it to MIME and uses ESMTP 8BITMIME (see above).

(I do *not* take any responsibility for the functionality of Pine 3.90
after applying this patch!)

Subject: Pine 3.90 and IMAP
Date: 5 Sep 1994 21:15:37 GMT
Message-Id: <34g1pp$frm@offas_dike.sbil.co.uk>

Dear All,

I have recently upgraded to 3.90 and took the oportunity of installing imapd
on our file-servers too -- this saves NFS mounting /usr/spool/mail onto every
client. But...

I specify numerous mail folders in my .pinerc, and combined with the .rhosts
mechanism this gives easy and fairly quick access to my mail without the need
for typing in a username & password. The problem (a niggle rather than a full
blown problem) is why doesn't PINE check your hostname before attempting to
open an IMAP connection?

If I'm logged into a machine for which one of my folders is actually local,
why doesn't PINE realise and simply access the file directly?

ie. I'm logged into `bismarck', and my INBOX is as follows

	INBOX	{bismarck}~/mail/INBOX

Wouldn't it be faster to simply open the file and read it?

	Will.

I'd like to suggest this as a future feature.

Currently pine reads the first few bytes of a file to be attached, and 
decides on that whether to simply make it an application/octet-stream, or 
one of PS/GIF/TIFF/or a few others.

This is currently done in code. Couldn't this be passed out to a 
/etc/magic-like file? That way sites could easily add 'native' support 
for their fav apps without having to hack the code (as I'm currently doing).

The flexFAX package (sending faxes under Unix) current employs this 
approach with much success.

As an example - I've yet to _ever_ see/or send a TIFF file (which has 
'native' support), but I see Framemaker docs every week. This is such a 
site-specific issue that I'm sure such a feature would be appreciated. 
Pine 3.90/via metamail allows things like application/x-framemaker to 
start an external app - but has no way of actually _producing_ 
application/x-framemaker.

(don't read too much into x-framemaker - it's just an example!!! ;-)

BTW - your "read some bytes" technique for sending MIME attachments
currently out-performs other more user-interactive forms I've seen in
other MIME MUAs - it's one less thing the user has to worry about/forget :-)

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I have found a possible bug in viewing PostScript attachments in 
3.90 using .mailcap . (BTW where is the "Sample mailcap file bundled with
the Pine distribution " as mentioned in Release notes ? - I did not
find it in pine3.90.tar.Z )

I will attach a postscript file using ^J in header and the pine correctly
encodes it. When I read the message with this attachment the pine displays
correctly that the 2nd attachment is a PostScript file (in rich header
is MIME Content-type:  APPLICATION/PostScript - read by /ucb/mail)
but using View attachment it complains:

Don't know how to display attachment format Application/POSTSCRIPT

(note the change in Capitals )

but the entry in .mailcap is correct, because metamail will correctly
run the ghostview. I have tried other MIME formats and everything works OK
(gif, jpeg, binary, )

(My mailcap is included as attachment)

Is there a bug in converting Capitals from .mailcap to MIME content-type
(case sensitivity in reading .mailcap)
or am I completely wrong in understanding of MIME .mailcap?

P.S. pine3.90 is great great great !!! Thanks

	One bug has been reported that "may be" an outgrowth of the problem
you are seeing.

	Pine does not like blank lines in the .mailcap file.  It treats it
like an EOF.  Try getting rid of the blank lines and try again.....

Thanks for the suggestion of the patch. The modification did not seem to
make much difference in the one communication environment I have noticed a
problem. Pine 3.90 does something - even with the suggested deletions from
ttyin.c. - 3.89 never did.

Environment: 3.90 compiled under Hpux 9.0
Problem seen only with Async. connections (via modem using Procomm Plus 
2.0 at 2400 Bd.) not in X or telnet connections.

Symptom: Every time the full folder index displays, or whenever I manually
rewrite an entire screen using ^L in the Message Text, when all 24 lines
have been written, the system sounds an alert several times displaying
"Command "^Q" not defined for this screen" or "Unknown Command: ^Q".  It
does seem to beep a fewer number of times after making the patch... In the 
same environment, Pine 2.89 compiled for Hpux seemed not to see the ^S ^Q 
or to ignore them. The frequent alert messages are just a nuisance, not a 
major problem.

    Is there a difference in IMAP mail server and POP mail server or in this

That's odd, I am using Pine with a vt220 emulator (WinQVT/net), and it 
is working fine.  Perhaps you do not have a proper termcap for vt220?

Later,

This is a bug report.

I have pine configured so that the default Fcc: is taken from the address
book.  Suppose I have an address in the book for a the user 
username@somewhere.com, with the nickname nick and the default folder
nickfolder.  When I call pine like this

% pine nick

I am placed in the composer with the cursor in the To: line, and with
username@somewhere.com written in it.  In the Fcc: it says "nickfolder".
so far, so good.  Now when I leave the To line, say by hitting the down 
arrow, the contents of the Fcc: field is replaced with "username".

93.5.10

         Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: 
                           IMAP vs. POP

                            Terry Gray
               Director, Networks & Distributed Computing
                     University of Washington

There are several different approaches to building a distributed electronic
mail infrastructure.  For example: LAN-oriented, vendor specific systems;
single time-sharing machine solutions; and Internet-oriented
mailserver-based solutions.  The principal options in this last category
are DMSP (Distributed Mail System Protocol), POP (Post Office Protocol),
and IMAP (Interactive Mail Access Protocol).  These protocols are more
robust foundations for a distributed email system than vendor-specific
systems requiring gateways to Internet mail.  Of these three, POP is the
oldest and consequently the best known.  DMSP is largely limited to a
single application, PCMAIL, and is known primarily for its disconnected
(offline) operation capabilities. IMAP offers significant advantages over
POP.  This gap is likely to widen as a result of the imminent addition of
disconnected operation extensions to IMAP. 

With POP (Post Office Protocol), mail is delivered to a shared server, and
a personal computer user periodically connects to the server and downloads
all of the pending mail to the "client" machine.  Thereafter, all mail
processing is local to the client machine.  Think of POP as providing a
store-and-forward service, intended to move mail (on demand) from an
intermediate server (drop point) to a single destination machine, usually a
PC or Mac. Once delivered to the PC or Mac, the messages are typically
deleted from the POP server. 

IMAP is a client-server mail protocol designed to permit manipulation of
remote mailboxes as if they were local.  With IMAP, mail is again delivered
to a shared server, but the mail client machine does not normally copy it
all at once and then delete it from the server.  It's more of a
client-server model, where the IMAP client can ask the server for headers,
or the bodies of specified messages, or to search for messages meeting
certain criteria. Messages in the mail repository can be marked as deleted
and subsequently expunged, but they stay on the repository until the user
takes such action.  Depending on the IMAP client implementation and the
mail architecture desired by a system manager, the user may save messages
directly on the client machine, or save them on the server, or be given
the choice of doing either. 

While POP and IMAP both allow access to mail on a remote server from a
variety of different client platforms, they reflect two different paradigms
and styles of use.  POP works best for people who use a single client
machine all the time; it is not well-suited for the goals of accessing
one's inbox of recent messages or saved-message folders from different
places and different machines at different times. 

The strength of POP, other than its wide availability, is that it minimizes
use of server resources and connect time when used via dialup.  However,
since IMAP is a functional superset of POP, it can also be used in the "POP
paradigm" of connecting to a mail server, retrieving all the pending
messages, and disconnecting.  Thus, the only advantage of the POP
*protocol* over IMAP relates to software availability and not
functionality.  As the amount of IMAP software is growing rapidly, the
historic prevalence of POP is of diminishing importance when compared to
the many advantages of IMAP. 

Because IMAP can mimic all of the POP mail retrieval functions, it is
useful to distinguish the characteristics of the IMAP and POP *paradigms*,
as well as the protocols themselves.  The paradigms define what the user
can do in each model; the protocol characteristics relate to efficiency,
performance, etc.  Here are some of the key similarities and differences
between the two...

o POP and IMAP reflect two different paradigms:
  -POP = store-and-forward (usually to a single client).
  -IMAP = multiple client-server mailbox access.

o Characteristics common to both POP and IMAP:
  -Mail is delivered to a shared, "always up" mail server.
  -New mail accessible from a variety of client platform types.
  -New mail accessible from anywhere in network.
  -Offline mail processing possible, though neither designed for it.
  -Protocols are open; defined by Internet RFCs.
  -Freely available implementations (including source) available.
  -Clients available for PCs, Macs, and Unix.
  -Commercial implementations available.
  -Internet oriented; no SMTP mail gateways required.

o POP paradigm advantages:
  -Minimum use of connect time.
  -Minimum use of server resources.

o POP protocol advantages:
  -Simpler protocol; easier to implement.
  -More client software currently available.

o IMAP paradigm advantages:
  -Saved-message folders may be stored on server (as well as INBOX).
  -Allows access to INBOX (not just new mail) from multiple platforms.
  -Allows concurrent access to a shared mailbox from multiple platforms.
  -Allows concurrent access to mailboxes on multiple mailservers.
  -Offers improved offline mail handling.
  -Allows selective transfer of messages/parts to client (local Save).
  -Can also use POP paradigm, for minimum connect time and server resources.

o IMAP protocol advantages:
  -Suitable for accessing non-email data; e.g., NetNews, documents.
  -Faster startup time, as only the headers are fetched initially.
  -Allows selective fetching of individual MIME message body parts.
  -Effective over low-speed links.
  -Ability to use server for searching.
  -Offline processing w/resynchronizing is a planned enhancement.

"Saved-message folders may be stored on server (as well as INBOX)" allows
"dataless" clients and/or nomadic users (e.g. student labs). 

"Allows access to INBOX (not just new mail) from multiple platforms" means
that if you have a Mac in your office, and PC at home, and a Unix machine
in the lab, you can move freely among them and access the same INBOX. 

"Allows concurrent access to a shared mailbox from multiple platforms."
This capability is useful when multiple individuals are processing messages
coming into a common inbox.  Changes in mailbox state can be presented to
all concurrently active clients via IMAP. 

"Allows concurrent access to multiple inboxes on multiple mailservers."
This is useful for people who have partitioned their incoming mail streams,
either via delivery filters, or by having different accounts for different
purposes. 

IMAP "offers improved offline mail handling" compared to POP. Unlike the
DMSP protocol used in the PCMAIL program, neither POP nor IMAP was designed
with offline use as a primary goal.  However, POP is widely used for this,
even though it is not particularly well-suited for the task. POP requires
you to either entrust all of your mail to your client machine (which may be
about to go thru an airport xray machine), or to over-ride the normal POP
server behavior of deleting the mail on the server, and manually
resynchronizing the diverging mailbox states at a later time.  IMAP can do
better:  you can connect to the server, save to a local folder all or
selected messages, and disconnect.  The advantages over POP are that (1)
the saved messages may be retained on the server, but *marked* as deleted,
so they can be distinguished later from unselected or more recent messages,
and expunged once it is clear they won't be needed, and (2) the ability to
save (download) selectively --especially important when one has a 2MB audio
message in the mailbox and is reading mail via a low-bandwidth connection
from a machine that has no sound capability. 

"Allows selective transfer of messages/parts to client (local Save)."
Especially when connecting to a mail server via low-bandwidth lines, it is
useful to be able to defer transferring messages that are not of immediate
interest until a more propitious time.  Moreover, with multimedia or
multipart MIME messages, transferring selected parts of a message in
increasingly useful. Efficient processing of MIME messages is one of the
major advantages of IMAP over POP.  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions.  It is a technique for encoding arbitrary files as
attachments to SMTP and RFC-822 compatible Internet mail messages.  This is
something that proprietary, LAN-oriented, mail systems have had for some
time, and now is finally available for the Internet.  It allows one to send
spreadsheets, word processing docs, images, and audio to 5 or 10 million of
"your closest Internet friends".  MIME has one particularly nice
capability: it allows inclusion of alternate representations.  For example,
a plain-text version of a document, plus a fax or RTF version.  With IMAP,
the receiving mail user agent gets to decide which message parts to
transfer and present to the user, falling back to plain text if that's all
it can do. 

Even though MIME support is not yet pervasive, its importance and impact on
the IMAP/POP question should not be underestimated. There is tremendous
pent-up demand for this capability and it is taking off fast.  In fact,
people are already using MIME for things that have nothing to do with mail
(e.g. encoding different representations of technical documents, for
campus-wide information systems.) MIME is orthogonal to IMAP and POP,
except that IMAP and MIME are extremely complementary, and there are
already IMAP clients that understand MIME.  (POP clients can and will be
taught to understand MIME, too, but the fact that POP copies all pending
messages at startup, and MIME messages can be very large, means that POP
users may need to become even more patient!)

"Can also use POP paradigm, for minimum connect time and server resources."
The POP paradigm is of interest in situations where the only access to a
mail server is via expensive dialup connections and multi-platform access
to one's inbox(es) is not needed.  It is also useful in environments where
client machines are resource-rich and servers are resource-poor.  However,
because IMAP is a superset of POP functionality, IMAP can be used in "POP
mode". That is, IMAP clients can be designed to provide the option of
transfering all messages to the client and processing them locally
(generally offline), thus providing the same advantages POP has in terms of
minimizing connect time and use of server resources. 

In summary, the fact that IMAP provides access to a persistent remote mail
store, and does not move all pending messages to the client machine, offers
more flexible access to that mail, and provides significant performance
advantages over POP in terms of start-up time and access to large MIME
messages.  The option of accessing remote saved-message folders and/or
NetNews via IMAP (and from the same mail user agent) provides additional
architectural flexibility in comparison to POP. 

A reasonable conclusion is that the only advantage of POP over IMAP is
that there is currently more POP software available.  However, this is
changing rapidly, and IMAP's functional advantages over POP are nothing
less than overwhelming. 

IMAP2 is defined in RFC-1176.  An "IMAP2bis" document describing recent
extensions to IMAP is available (along with various IMAP clients and a
server) in the /mail directory of ftp.cac.washington.edu.  Also available
from the same place is a POP server that, in addition to offering the
normal POP service, can relay commands to an IMAP server, thus permitting
existing POP clients to access an IMAP server.  The IMAP server available
from UW also incorporates a NetNews driver, used at UW as part of its
Campus-Wide Information System.

More seriously, I think the current Append/Overwrite behaviour is right.  
In previous versions of Pine there was NO easy way to overwrite a file; 
now there is.  As with previous changes it's just a little matter of 
finger training -- it took me a while to get used to running with 
confirmation of expunges turned off (I kept typing a "y" ahead as 
confirmation, which instead get taken as a prYnt command).

The prompts are in line with the rest of Pine's behaviour.

If your termcap is like the standard SunOS, there is no entry for vt220, 
but there is one for vt200, try it.

That's unusual. I am using DEC vt220 and never seen any problem with pine.
Probably your termcap is not properly setup.

Subject: PC pine 3.90 and DOS 6.3 ?????
Date: 6 Sep 1994 12:49:43 GMT
Message-Id: <34hoh7$1d3@belfort.daimi.aau.dk>

Has anyone tried to use PC pine 3.90 (both dos and win. vers.)
on a PC running DOS 6.3 ?

We have one PC with DOS 6.3 installed and PC pine 3.90 can't send
mails from that PC. On other PC's it work ok, and PC pine 3.89
also works OK on the DOS 6.3 machine.

If PC pine 3.90 is run on "raw" dos 6.3 it goes all right, but
if it is started e.g. from windows (both dos pine 3.90 and the
win pine 3.90 can be started from windows) it can't send mails.
Everything else works OK, just the smtp mailtransfere from the
pc to the mailserver don't work. On the same machine everything
works OK with pine 3.89.


Any good suggestions help and hints are welcome.

Thanks in advance

In the configuration of Pine there is an option to put your ".signature"

This is probably one of the most common Pine questions/requests I get.
I don't know why the default isn't at the end of the file (especially
for replies.)  I guess you can't please all the people all the time.

For Unix Pine (v3.89) you should have a file in your home directory
called .pinerc.  This file is well commented and shouldn't be overlooked
for a wealth of information in configuring Pine.  Every time I help
someone with something I seem to learn more about Pine.

The information you are looking for is in a line called:

feature-list:

Above the line is a bunch of options which should be comma separated.
The one you are interested in is called "signature-at-bottom".  Your
feature-list line should look something like this:

feature-list: signature-at-bottom

Reading the .pinerc file should shed more light on the subject.

	A simple test here:

1.	Export message to new file.

2.	Export another message to same file.

3.	Choose Overwrite.

4.	Worked fine here.....

	Can you supply more details on your environment?

Now fixed.  (It was, by the way, a passwd file problem that also

This should be a selectable feature; marking items as read using a 
newsreader is automatic.

What the Pine Development Team should consider is checking with Iain Lee 
(or whatever his name is) and develop a merger of Pine and Tin together 
so that the features of threaded newsreading will be available for Pine 
users as well as the other features.  I'd like to see Pine become a "one 
stop shopping" place for news and mail.  As it is, it's very good; I'd 
like to see it do better.

The IMAP server on "bismarck" might not be the c-client
implementation.  "~/mail/INBOX" might not be what it is in the
filesystem.

Date: 6 Sep 1994 17:34:00 GMT
Message-Id: <34i968$s66@agate.berkeley.edu>

Hi, I'm wondering if there is a fix yet for the PC-Pine bugette that occurs
when attempting to read an attachment when PC-Pine is run from a LAN drive.
Specifically, Pine tries to create a temporary file on the root drive from
which it is run, instead of the directory pointed to by the TMP or TEMP 
environment variable. Since users don't normally have write access to the
root of a shared disk, (most of) our users can't read or save attachements.

Thanks,

Erik Pearson

Try the following in your .pinerc

# Name of file to read signature out of for inclusion in outgoing mail
signature-file=/pde1/nabisa/.signature

feature-list=old-growth,
	signature-at-bottom

That will work.

Prof. Jensen,

	I'm not sure if Pine has implemented a personalized way of ordering 
mailboxes.  I do remember, though, back w/ an earlier version (we're now 
at version 3.90), mailboxes seemed to be ordered by date of creation.
	
	I'm also not sure if there's a way to specifically ask Pine to not 
delete mailboxes within a certain time frame.

	I'm cc:'ing this message to the Pine-Info list; hopefully they'll 
have some answers as well.

	Sincerely,

	Hussain

It'd be nice to be able to specify the Content and Encoding type to be used
for attachments.  A mime.types file is a good start (this should be used
to obtain the default settings), but files don't always have the right
extentions.

Subject: INBOX locked by other process?
Date: 6 Sep 1994 18:31:20 GMT
Message-Id: <34icho$ahc@herald.indirect.com>

Today, out of the blue, I am getting an error when I attempt to start Pine.

The error is...
'can't open folder lock, access is readonly'
'folder is open by another process, access is readonly'

I get this on both my INBOX folder and my sent-mail folder.

I checked and my sent-mail folder is both read and write enabled.


The only thing I can think of that changed is that I untarred a file to 
my /tmp directory last week and hadn't ran Pine since then.

I went back and deleted the files that came from the Tar but that didn't 
correct the problem.


Any ideas??

I've also noticed that Pine V3.90 is noticeably slower than V3.89, on both
the DEC 3000/400 running OSF/1 V3.0 and on the DECstation 5000/200 running
Ultrix V4.4.

Invoking pine is comparable. Listing the folders is also. Where I notice a 
difference is closing folders, and especially when closing a folder that
has deleted messages. Hopefully the V3.91 will fix this. Closing Pine also 
seems to take longer. I could run some benchmarks if you like as I have
both sets of executables on both machines.

Of course, if you have a remote NNTPSERVER and use Pine for news, the 
response slows dramatically. I don't use Pine for news because of this.

Hi everyone,

	I just compiled pine (build nxt) 3.90 and it seem to work flawlessly 
on our NeXT machines running NS 3.2

	Apparently, though, users have been recieving this message right 
after they quit, after having marked some mail in their INBOXes deleted:

	Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
	Exiting pine.
	IOT trap.

	Any clues?

That message means that another Pine session has the folder open, but is
unable to release the lock.  Do you have a session suspended in the
background?

The message ``folder is open by another process'' is spurious (this bug 
will be fixed in Pine 3.91).  The real problem is that it can not create 
the folder lock file on /tmp.  Check the protections on /tmp as well as 
the results from
	ls -la /tmp
The folder lock file will have a name such as /tmp/.600.8aef (that is, 
two hex numbers separated by periods).  Remove any old folder lock files 
that you see on /tmp.

Message-Id: <Cvpz0r.MHq@rahul.net>

Here are instructions for setting up a mail filter on your Unix host.  
This uses the filter option of the Elm mail reader... but the filter puts 
your mail into standard mail folders, and so once you have set up filter, 
you can read mail with Pine or Elm, etc.  You can also setup the filter 
to forward mail from specified users, and so on.  If you have suggestions 
for improving this document see the ftp location at the end.

USING ELM'S FILTER PROGRAM TO FILTER INCOMING MAIL
==================================================

1] Note the full path for filter by typing:

     which filter

   If your system doesn't have filter ask your sys admin to install it.

<<< filter is installed at /local/bin/filter >>>

2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd

<<< mine is ~  (~ means your home directory) >>>

3] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules


4] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules:

if (to contains "seasigi") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.seasigi"
if (to contains "lynx-dev") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.lynx-dev"
if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-talk"
if (to contains "www-announce") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-announce"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Unix mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses /Mail
   (upper case M).
   
   Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...


<<<   mine looks like this. (I'm on 3 mailing lists)
    if (to contains "consim") then save " ~/Mail/Inbox.consim-l"
    if (to contains "666th-etal") then save " ~/Mail/Inbox.airwarrior"
    if (to contains "GERMNEWS") then save "/bolero/home/jloll/Mail/germnews"
>>>


5] To see what the filter rules will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


6] Create a ~/.forward file by typing:

     cd
     pico .forward


7] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:

     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

<<<
and mine is "|/local/bin/filter -o /bolero/home/jloll/.elm/filter-errors"
>>>

   Note you do want to include the quotes and you want to replace
   /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1) 
   and replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   
   Note that on some systems you will need to make your .forward world 
   readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
   mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
     cd
     chmod 644 .forward
     chmod +x .

<<<I think that the permissions were already ok for me. >>>

8] Send yourself an email message to make sure that regular messages
   get through to your default inbox.


9] Regularly look at ~/.elm/filterlog and filter-errors to make sure things 
   are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
   log in by putting the following in your .login:

     tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

   Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
   they don't fill up your disk space!

<<< purge them regularly.  my filterlog is 25k for two days. >>>
<<< Further notes:
    pine will send any mail not matching the descriptions to INBOX.

    pine will not notify you about about the new mail in the other boxes.

    It is best to keep incoming mail apart from the archived stuff.
    I have a Inbox.consim and save the interesting messages to the
    consim box after I have read them.
>>>

  man filter |less

I hope this helps.  Please send me any suggestions for improving it - updated
versions will be on ftp://ftp.ii.com/pub/ii/Internet/filtering_mail.

I can't quite remember the details, but you need to change the SPELLER
definition in pine/osdep/os-linux.h to "ispell -l" instead of the
default "spell".  And recompile pine :)
 
ps: my compliments to the pine team, 3.90 is excellent stuff.

In Pine 3.89, I used to take some inbound mail and sort them -- one 
mailing list in a folder, another in a different folder, and if it was 
directly to me, in my saved-messages folder.

This was fine and dandy, because all mail tossed into the folders were 
flagged NEW, but now in Pine 3.90, all of a sudden, my tossed (saved into 
folder) mail isn't being makred New.  Now I have no idea where I stopped 
reading from my folders!  Erasing the mail after isn't really an option 
because I like being able to refer back to older mail (well, at least 
until my disk quota runs short ;> ).

Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?

Thanks in advance..

	Just remember that the elm "filter" program *is* case sensitive
when it comes to headers.  For example, it matches on Cc: but not cc: or
CC:

	This is one of the reasons I switched to procmail.

Pine 3.90 seems to work fine on our HP-UX system...

I have always wanted to sort my folder by the "To:" or "Reply to:" 
fields and was hoping it would be supported in 3.90 but I haven't seen 
a way to do it yet?  Could someone tell me how to do it?

Thanks,

Problem with flagging.. I LOVE Pine 3.90..  Anyway, how do I move 
multiple messages using flag?  What flag command do I use (REad, deleted, 
important), and then what is the command to move them to a different 
folder?  And do I *shudder* have to UNFLAG them after moving so I don't 
accumulate flagged messages and keep moving the whole bunch to a folder 
where I only need a few?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  a reply 
by email would be better, but you can reply here too.. IF its not too 
flooded with other messages to find what I want..
Thanks

You didn't specify if you were using imap to access folders.  We were getting
this problem with imapd 3.3 because there was a problem with its "kiss of
death" routine.  The first time you connected to your mailbox the imap
process created a lockfile in /tmp containing its process-id; unfortunately
the lockfile was marked unreadable by all other processes.  If you tried to
access the same folder concurrently from another Pine or ECSMail, the second
imap couldn't read the file in /tmp and hence couldn't signal the first imap
to let go of the lock.  I don't believe this was fixed in imapd 3.4, but
perhaps someone else knows better.  (We have a non-standard fix on.)

	Tell us what platform you are using.  Tell us what the sequence of

Hello,

    I am trying to setup Pine to Auto-answer certain messages.
So if someone sent me a message with the Subject: Apple Tree
Pine would automatically send them a pre-determined document on apple trees.
Likewise with other subjects...

    I believe that I need to edit/create a .forward file.  Does anyone 
know how this is really done?  Are there any disadvantages or known 
problems with this feature?   Details appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

There are not currently any options to alter the sort order of a Folder List,
other than for news-collections.  How would you want the folders ordered
other than alphabetic?

Is there a way to convert or import an ascii file containing a large number

Is mail.crl.com configured as an IMAP server?  Do you have 

	inbox-path={mail.crl.com}INBOX

(assuming that is where you recieve mail)?

	After you have used the ";" command to select a group of messages
you can use the "A" command to apply an action to the selected group.

	Well, what you want to do is not done by pine.  And, FYI, the .forward
file is restricted to use with pine since the .forward has to do with 
"sendmail".

	Look into using the package known as "procmail"

A recent version can be picked up at various comp.sources.misc archives.
The latest version can be obtained directly from the ftp-archive at:
 
        ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (137.226.225.3)

I'm also having problems with my user-domain being used in the To line
when I don't want it to be used.  Here's my situation...  

I have my own domain name (ii.com) and a company (The Internet Company)
that forwards mail sent to anything@ii.com to nancym@halcyon.com.  So,
I want my From line to always say:

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>

But whenever I send mail to anyone without specifying a domain I want
Pine to first check my addressbook and then if that name isn't in
my addressbook I want Pine to either leave the name alone (i.e.,
don't add a domain name) or add the domain halcyon.com.  So, for
example, if I send mail to support I want the To line to look like
one of these:

To: support
To: support@halcyon.com

I've tried all combinations of user-lookup-even-if-domain-mismatch and
use-only-domain-name and I always get the following:
 
To: support@ii.com


Any ideas on how I can get the behavior I want?

Thanks,
Nancy

	No.  The /etc/services file would be used in setting up the
server side.  Since pine is a client....you would do it as David indicated.

Sorry about the previous brief message regarding ^O function.

Here's the jist.

	I compiled two different versions of PINE ... one for Sparcstations
1(+) running SunOS4.13 and the other is for 486 running Linux 0.99pl13.
Now, the ^O function works fine on the SunOS ... but it doesn't work on the
Linux.  Is it possible that the feature was forgotten on the lnx-os.h files?
Basically, I'm able to toggle the ^O function on the SunOS but when I hit
the same keys on for the pine on LINUX .. nothing.

	I hope this is a better detailed problem reporting?

Subject: Way to force "jamesd" to "jamesd@teleport.com" in reply?
Date: 6 Sep 1994 21:52:41 -0700
Message-Id: <34jgup$hm7@claudia.teleport.com>

We've installed 3.90 and it seems like a solid release.  One problem that
I have is that we have a small cluster of user machines.  A user might
use any one of 4 machines.  When doing a reply to another user who uses
pine, the reply is fine.  When doing a reply to a user who uses elm or
Mail, the reply is not fine - when a user on the same system is
involved, these programs give <jamesd> as the return address.  Pine (and
some other programs) give <jamesd@teleport.com> as the return address.

Pine fills in the address as "jamesd@machine.teleport.com" which is not
a valid address.  "machine" is filled in with whichever machine the user
happens to be on.

We'd like to force pine to append "@teleport.com" when confronted with
<username>.  This is the same behavior that Mail and elm have.

We have the following set in "/usr/local/lib/pine.conf".  

# Domain name you are in  e.g. nwnet.net, cac.washington.edu, bwc.org
user-domain=teleport.com

# Eliminate host part from hostname, using only domain part for domain name
use-only-domain-name=yes

Those two settings do NOT show up in the user's .pinerc even when the
user invokes pine for the first time.  I feel that they should and I'm
concerned that pine reads the user's .pinerc and sees the empty fields on
some options and unsets them.

However even after setting the options in .pinerc we still have the same
problem with the machine name showing up if there's not a FQDN on the
address.

Is there a way to force "jamesd" to be read as "jamesd@teleport.com"?

Thanks.

I've got the same problem building 3.90 on SunOS 4.1.2
compatible box. Found a workaround after sweating bullets,
THEN I found a possible answer in the post by Alain
Robiete(sp?) subj: Abort problem on Solaris. Has to
do with adding a particular string-handling parameter
to GCCs commandline and recompiling.

Can't wait to see if I could have saved myself hours
of tracking down a workaround! :-(  Oh, wait! I'm 
paid by the hour! :-)

Date: 7 Sep 1994 09:36:39 GMT
Message-Id: <34k1j7$3i8@netserver.fisonssurf.co.uk>

I am trying to compile Pine on an ICL DRS6000 machine. This runs 
SVR4 (version 7?). To Build pine I used:

build sv4

It compiles fine until it reaches the Pine directory. Below is the output 
that Build gives. I have turned on extra debug info. from the compiler where this 
error is. It complains about 'system' and 'rename' being redeclared. Has anybody
else seen this problem and know of a fix. Otherwise, I will have to do some
serious digging.

I am reading news from a remote machine and I can't say it is so
"dramatically" slow. Actually, works fine. Maybe you have a poor link

Try specifying your terminal as vt200 or even vt100.

Opps! Obviously this should be the place where your

Alex,
Mark tells me that he fixed the bug you described some time ago, so the
current distribution should be setting protections on the lockfiles 
correctly.

Ed,
There was an inadvertent transposition of port and flag in David's posting.  
So, per the author of that section of code:

>  The spec for .pinerc is:        *{<server>:<port>/nntp}[]
>  e.g.                            *{news.foo.bar:123/nntp}[]

Alternatively, for the nntp-server variable, just add the ":port" to the
end, e.g. 
  nntp-server=news.foo.bar:123

This is needed for posting, and will also take care of newsreading in 
the default case, where you don't specify any news-collections separately.

Note that you need to restart Pine for a change in port specification
to take effect, even though Pine doesn't tell you that.

I am running on an RS/6000 980 using AIX 3.2.4ish. Nothing too unsusal, 
but when I do the exact same steps  as you detail below I get an appended 
message not an overwrite.

The function key assignments in Pine are currently fixed.  Neither terminfo
nor termcap are consulted.

1. Get Pine 3.90 from ftp.cac.washington.edu.

2. Add "-Dconst=" to the CFLAGS line in pine/makefile.sv4 before building.

I am running AIX 3.2.4(ish). I have tried exactly the steps below and I
still get an append. Sigh! It sounds like I am alone. Any other AIXers running 
Pine 3.90 out there want to test this?

Pine 3.90 is the latest version.  I have some modifications to Pine's
somewhat awkward SVR4 support.  Whoever produced the original SVR4 port
did it assuming a non-ANSI C compiler!  I cannot really believe this
since *all* C compilers for SVR4 that I know of support ANSI C (the AT&T
compiler supports ANSI, gcc supports ANSI, etc.)

Anywya, I have patches to convert the non-ANSI SVR4 Pine into ANSI.  I
plan to send them to the maintainers as soon as I get some spare time,
hopefully by the end of the week.  I'll try to post them here also.

I just tried the same test on my RS/6000 AIX 3.2.4 and got the same 
(wrong) results: choosing O(verwrite) Appends.

Subject: Can't build pine under VAX/Ultrix 4.3

Sorry if this is a FAQ and sorry for the long post, but is there any
gotchas in getting Pine 3.90 to build on a MicroVAX 3100 running Ultrix
4.3 (Rev. 44) ? I have tried to carry out the build, using the "vul"
predefined configuration, with no success with regards to the pine
executable. Since the standard cc didn't work, I tried with gcc, also
installed on the machine, but that didn't work either. imap and pico build
correctly with either compiler, though. Here are the corresponding
failures:

Like I mentioned, imap and pico do build correctly; what's more, imapd is
now running happily on the machine (Stanford's Mailstrom provided an
excellent testing base).

First try, using standard cc:

A recent message noted that you can now build 3.90 with the mbox driver 
by adding mboxdriver as a parameter to the BUILD line.

I tried doing that, and I have a zero length mbox file in my home 
directory, but pine isn't moving the mail from /var/spool/mail into that 
file.  Is there anything else I have to do?

No default-composer-hdrs match displaying defaults
and it gives me the old ones!  What am I or it doing wrong.  I manually 
edited .pinerc and used the config option in setup!!!

I apoligize if this is a FAQ but can someone explain the difference 
between the Subject sort and the OrderedSubject sort?  From my untrained 
eye the OS sort just messes everything up.

This has been brought up before; the answer has always been "No." ;{(.  
Not only does the "X" key proximity to the "C" key lead one to often 
press "Ctrl-C" when they mean "Ctrl-X" [and of course you ALWAYS follow 
"Ctrl-X" with "y" as a matter of habit... ;{(!] but those people used to 
EMACS REALLY have to be careful because "Ctrl-X Ctrl-C" is the "exit" 
command in EMACS.  Sigh...

Pine is a great product, and in despite of this annoyance I use it 
constantly.  *THANKS* to the Pine development team for making such a 
useful utility available!  I would ask them, however, to reconsider their 
stand on programmable keys...  At least on SOME programmable keys??? :{)

Thanks,

Mike

There's a bug in 3.90 where the colons confuse Pine.
This will be fixed in 3.91, but the work-around is to delete the colons.

Hi,

I am successfully running PINE on 4 unix machines(HP-UX V8.0, 2 SunOS 
4.1.3 and linux (debian) kernel 0.99.14.  Since I like PINE so well on 
the unix boxes, I thought it might be nice to offer this to some of our 
users that use PCs for the most part and have no need (other than mail) 
to log into either our VAX(yuk) or a unix box.

Enter PC-PINE and imapd.  The PCs are running Pathwork's V4.1 for DecNet 
and Trumpet's winsock.dll for TCP/IP under windows.  I know that the 
winsock.dll is working because I can use xwin, wftpd, winftp32 and 
WinMosaic which all use winsock.  The problem I see when I start PC-PINE 
is 

Can't connect to livingstone.ttd.teradyne.com:143: Refused 10061

I have done a little work in an attempt to see if things are setup 
correctly.  In /etc/inetd.conf I added the following line:
	imap	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/bin/imapd	imapd

and in /etc/services I added:
	imap	143/tcp

On one of the unix systems I modified my configuration so that my inbox is
	inbox-path = {livingstone.ttd.teradyne.com}/usr/spool/mail/kenny
With this done, I get connected to my inbox fine from the unix box.

I have taken that .pinerc file and used it with PCPINE and I get the same 
error message.

I assume that I must be missing something very simple.  Can someone 
please point this out?

Thanks,

Ran the same test here.  The overwrite actually appends.

The simpler, the better.
Something like plain UNIX mail would be great, but I need to do this under DOS.
I looked at Pine, but I can't fudge it into a pseudo-batch mode.
Any ideas?

Nancy,
There is a compile-time option to enable you to tweak the From: line via 
the custom-headers variable.  (And, less elegantly, there is always Reply-To)

Message-Id: <34l92q$920@nntp.crl.com>

Has anyone been able to get PC Pine 3.9 to work with CRL and TIA?

I can't get the mail or newsreader to work.  I need an IMAP server
address along with an INBOX path.

For the newsreader, I tried to get a list of the newsgroups by
expanding to list them, but nothing happens.

There is a little communication, but that's it.  Nothing else.

I use to be able to have 50+ messages and if I wanted to go to message
5 I just typed "5" and it would go there, now it says it doesn't understand,
any ideas how to get that feature back, please?

Thanks.

	Yes!

	Pine is now at 3.90.  Please grab it from ftp.cac.washington.edu
and try to compile.  Some of the errors are similar to what I'm seeing
on a MIPS machine.  Maybe when you fix it on your machine you'll fix
my problem as well.   :-) :-)

I just figured out one way to do this so I'll answer my own question.
You can use environment variables so for this example I put the
following in my .login:

setenv ORGANIZATION "Infinite Ink, Seattle, Washington, USA"

And then in my .pinerc put:

customized-hdrs=Organization: $ORGANIZATION


Hope this is useful to others,
Nancy (loving Pine 3.90!)

Subject: Pine and no access to my remote mail
Date: 7 Sep 1994 21:19:40 -0400
Message-Id: <34lorc$1eo@ionews.io.org>

I have installed Pine 3.90 on my Linux system.

My internet service allows me to use SLIP to connect.

I am able to connect via SLIP and do everything using Microsoft Windows.  
Since I moved to Linux and Pine 3.90, I am unable to retrieve my mail 
from my remote mailbox.

I can telnet, ftp, read news (via Pine 3.90) ...

The system is set up with a specific mail server ... mail.io.org

On my Linux system, I log in as terryc, the same name as my account at 
the service.

In .pinerc, I have my INBOX set for:   {mail.io.org}inbox

When I try to retrieve my mail, I get:

Connection refused, 143.

My friend, using another service provider can easily retrieve his mail.

The administrator at my site says the problem is *mine* and not his.

I have my own server set up in my .rhosts file ... with my user name terryc.

Does anyone have any ideas?  Have any evidence I can use to convince the 
administrator that something is wrong on his end (if it is)?

Any advice greatly appreciated ...

Thanks ...
Terry

This is the key.  This error almost always means that the host is not 
running an imap server.  (IMAP uses port 143.)

Well, I suppose he could argue that it is your problem that you chose his 
service... :)

The imapd code is available from ftp.cac.washington.edu.  It's part of 
the pine distribution in /pine/pine.tar.Z, and there are also pre-compiled
binaries in /pine/unix-bin

I have 3.2.4 running on an RS/6000 and I can't reproduce your problem - the
overwrite facility is all hunky-dory. Looking for the common denominator: did
you guys with the problem compile it yourselves or download the binary from
the UoW?

Er, that should be either 9.03 or 9.05 for Series 700 machines :-) 9.04 is for
the Series 800s.

I don't know what you mean by "clean", but if you want a version that compiles
smoothly with the HP-UX C compiler in ANSI mode [the authors avoided this
because it gives out some telling compiler warnings :-) ], then you can pick
it up from one of our official archive sites listed below as the file
/hpux9/Users/pine-3.90.tar.gz.

We keep .cln original versions so users can see exactly what we modified
(find . -name '*.cln' gives the game way) and users can even reverse our
changes by renaming the .cln files back to their original names.

	From the Main Menu go to SetUp....then go to Configure....

	Find the line that reads:

	Add what is needed.....something like....

This problem is nothing at all to do with Pine but to do with: a) the way 
you have typed the text in to your .sig file, and b) possibly how PopMail 
has been set up (it would have helped to know which platform this was on).

a)  Assuming the signature file you're having problems with is the same 
as you used in your query (see below)...  You have used a mixture of tabs 
and spaces in your signature.  Not all programs "obey" tabs.  Others so 
"obey" them (expand them) but don't use the "standard" multiple-of-8 tab 
stops.  For example, TeachText on an Apple Macintosh doesn't honour tabs, 
but just displays them as the width of a space.

You can help by getting rid of all the tabs from your signature file and 
replacing them with spaces.  This MAY be all that's needed.

b)  The other problem may lie with the PopMail user and how they have 
configured PopMail.  Your signature appears to be one of the "pretty" 
ones that tries to draw pictures using characters.  This will only work 
if the font used to view the message is a mono-spaced (every character 
has the same width) font.

If the user has set up PopMail to use a proportionally spaced font (eg, 
Times) then no matter what you do you will not be able to produce good 
looking pictures.  (We run into this problem a lot with people trying to 
word process CV's using Times; they can't get columns lines up if they 
don't know how to use Tabs.)

Pine 3.90 follows symbolic links in the mail directory, which is very
nice. If I create a symlink to a directory, I whish for pine to enter
that directory when I select it from the Folders menu. Alas, it does
not. 
I realise that I could flatten out the directory structure by creating
symlinks to the individual files, but that would mean having more than
100 folders in the Folders menu.

I agree, it is not a 'fast' link. However, it's not the news performance I
was referring to, it's how a slow news link affects folder listing in Pine.

Pine 3.90 is fantastic. A significant improvement to 3.89. I'm a very happy
user.

I believe you want 'enable-jump-shortcut' enabled in the feature list.

Well, I've tried more things and got it working now but it seems that
when you change things in .fixed it puts up these ugly messages each
time a user starts pine. The command line way is cleaner but can make for 
a pretty long command line.

I have built pine3.89 and pine3.90 with no problems on a DRS6000 v7.
I used `gcc -fno-builtin -traditional` to solve the problems you

Jan,
We call what you want "hierarchy support", and it is a high priority for 
"Pine 4.0", but don't even ask when that will be out.

Jan,
I should add:  each *directory* can become an individual 
"folder-collection", therefore, you don't need links to individual 
folders, you just need to define one collection-per-directory.

(Nonetheless, in the future you'll be able to have a single collection 
containing directories that you can traverse.)

Hi,

I am still having problems getting PC-PINE working.  I believe that the 
problem is on the server side because if I watch IP traffic I see that my 
PC is making a request for port 143, but the server is refusing the 
connection.  (I also tried telnet-ing to the server port and was refused, 
I don't know whether this is a valid test though.)

I am running imapd on a Sun SPARC 10 (SunOS 4.1.3).  I downloaded the 
source and compiled locally.  Pine and pico seem to work fine.  I have 
added configuration to inetd.conf and services for imap also.  All this 
done, I still get: Can't connect ...:Refused (10061) on the PC.

Can someone please shed some light on my problems?

Thanks,

Hi,
   Has anyone encountered and found work arounds for these two problems with
PC-Pine?

    1) Sorting folders by anything other than Arrival, spins the disk and
       locks up the machine.

    2) After running PC-Pine, accessing any netware drive that was mounted
       crashes the machine.

   This is with version 3.90.  I've tried it on three different machines
(a 486 and two 386s), one of which I wiped the disk and installed DOS, 
Netware and Lan WorkPlace fresh.

    I did send in a bug report on this, but haven't heard back yet.  So I
thought I'd ask here and see if anyone else has seen this and has any ideas.

  Was reading newsgroups and found a message there I wanted to forward to 
another user here locally.  Hit F to forward, but it stayed in that 
newsgroup header format instead of asking for the e-mail address of the

default to e-mail rather than forwarding into the same newsgroup?

This would have been a valid test.  (At least it is on our
Sequents...)  Kinda fun actually.  Grab the RFC's pertinent to IMAP
and then telnet to port 143 and try some commands out.  This seems to
me to be the best way to get familiar with the IMAP protocols, IMO.

I can try.. Did you perhaps forget to restart the inetd daemon?  You
need to do a kill -HUP xx where xx is the process number of inetd.
When inetd receives a Hangup signal it will re-read its configuration
information from /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf.  Needless to say
you need to be root to successfully run the kill command.

Hope this helps...

In User Services here we were talking about pine's surprising handling
of .newsrc.  It seems very counterintuitive to use the delete command
on news articles since the user does not truly have the ability to
delete and expunge.  We'd have figured you would use the same trigger
as you do with mail to mark articles as seen or unseen.  This way
users would simply read news, and on leaving the newsgroup pine would
update .newsrc to show which articles were seen-- just as trn or other
newsreaders would do-- and just as pine itself does with mail files.

Don't your users in Washington get confused about this?  People here
keep asking why they can't expunge articles, based on the fact that
they can mark them deleted.  If the implementation of the delete
command was based on user comments, we'd be curious to see more
information.  We're scratching our heads here over this.

Is there a script or something that will allow me to compress my "sent"

Joe,
News readers and mail readers have traditionally treated messages 
differently.  News readers usually make messages "disappear" by virtue 
of simply looling at them once.  Mail readers never do that, at least I 
don't know of any examples that do.  When you have a tool that does both 
mail and news, you either have to pick *one* paradigm, or have a 
confusing modality.

Moreover, given that you only get one bit of per-message state in the 
.newsrc, you have to decide what that bit should mean: (1) that the 
message has been seen once, or (2) that the user has explicitly 
indicated that it is no longer of interest and marked Deleted, 
or if you prefer, "Dismissed" it.  In my mind, that's a no-brainer.

This design decision was debated at great length, and we came down on 
the side of consistent usage between mail and news as the fundamental 
principle we cared about, more than consistency with the way other news 
readers behave.  It was not acceptable to us to have Pine start "hiding" 
messages simply because someone looked at them once, nor was it 
acceptable to have a completely differenet behavior for mail and news.

That you cannot expunge news messages is true, but you CAN eXclude them.
And, by the way, it is possible to have shared mailboxes where eXpunge 
is not permitted as well, so this concept is not unique to news.

The svr4 build in pine is based on DRS6000, cos we did it.

It was done as a minimum port about 18 months ago.

The -Dconst=3D fix has been around for about 12 months, but has yet to make=

it into the official source.

My version has been recompiled, but I just ftp-ed the a32 binary from

We have something of a mixed bag of pine versions in our company at the 
moment.  Prior to June everyone used 3.05.  Then we moved to 3.89, or at 
least we started to.  Soon hopefully, we'll go to 3.90; however, not 
everyone is happy with 3.89 yet.

I received this complaint from a user today:
	 I attached a binary file (an MS Word document) to an
         email message I was creating (using pine on denver
         server) addressed to a person who uses MS Mail to read
         his mail (he has an MS Mail Gateway & we exchange mail
         frequently).  In the past when I have done this, pine has
         prompted me with "attach as a MIME attachment?" &, if I
         answer yes, has created a MIME attachment to the email,
         &, if I answer no, has created a UUENCODEd inclusion /
         attachment within the email.  This time, pine simply
         created a MIME attachment without asking.  This is a
         problem because I must exchange binary attachments with
         my correspondents who use MS Mail.

What happened to the UUENCODE option between 3.05 and 3.89/3.90?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jim Weaver

That message is coming from the NNTP server.  Pine does passes it along for
your information.  Was your post a reply with alot of included text?

I have Pine 3.90 running on solaris 2.3.  It appears that there is a bug 
in pine when the .newsrc file does not exist in the users home 
directory.  The "Select Here" button changes to "Empty List - Select here 
to try reexpanding" and a 0 byte .newsrc file is created in the users 
home directory.  This is not a problem if one has another news reader to 
run first, but we don't want to make users run a specific news reader 
since pine can do mail and news...  Does anyone know what to do about this?

Thank You

Greg,
Would the problem be solved if the "Empty List" message was changed to say
something about 'Use "A Subscribe" to add newsgroups" ?

My system is a Sun4m running SunOS 4.1.3, and Pine 3.90.  I was composing
a message addressed to two different alias definitions (not addressbook). 
When I hit ^X, there was a message something like, "This message could be
read by thousands of users, are you sure?"  I pressed n, and the message
was not sent (as expected).  I checked the "rich" headers, and no
newsgroups were filled in.  I pressed ^X again, and it worked this time. 
I tried to duplicate it, but couldn't.  Curious....

Well, you went sort of the long way around. `cat |' unnecessary.

pine -conf > pine.conf 
would do the trick.

If you don't mind a bit of advice: get a good book on using Unix. I 
recommend Kochan & Wood's _Exploring the Unix System_.

In my systems' pine.conf file, I'd like to *not* specify the domain-name, 
but just tell it to strip the hostnames (i.e., for aida.econ.yale.edu, 
othello.econ.yale.edu and fidelio.econ.yale.edu have them all use 
econ.yale.edu as the host-address).

What I would imagine is needed is to have this:


# Sets domain part of From: and local addresses in outgoing mail.
user-domain=
[munch]
# If "user-domain" not set, strips hostname in FROM address. (Unix only)
use-only-domain-name=Yes

But it doesn't seem to work. What's wrong?

Thanks,
LT

Hi,

I would like to view an image file that was sent as an attachment to a 
mail message.  I understand I need to set up a mailcap file, however I 
can't seem to find any documentation on setting up this file.  The 
release notes say a sample mailcap file was in the distribution, however 
I can't seem to find it.

Can someone please send be an example mailcap file?  The image viewer I 
want to use is 'xv'.

Thanks,

Date: 08 Sep 1994 17:12:31 GMT
Message-Id: <P15254.94Sep8101233@winkey.geg.mot.com>

Is it possible when using Pine 3.90 as a newsreader to have the
default save directory be ~/News and the default folder be the name of
the newsgroup that I'm currently reading.  This action would conform
to most of the newsreaders of which I'm aware.  Pine seems to want to
save in ~/Mail/saved-messages, which is OK for reading normal mail,
but I prefer the other behavior when I'm reading news.

Thanks,

Rick,
I can grant one of your wishes:

If you select "by-recipient" as your "saved-msg-name-rule" you'll get the 
default folder name you wish... and it's also handy for email lists.

Since Pine tries to treat news and mail as much alike as possible, it 
naturally offers the same default folder collection for Saves from either 
kind of folder, so we have no answer at this time for your second wish...

I should add that you can define a second folder collection for ~/News,
so that you are only one keystroke away from your second wish :)
That is: S ^N RETURN will then save to the desired collection.

Now for the opposing view:

At Carnegie Mellon, we find Washington's handling of "deleted" in news
to be indicative of and limited to a model where "news" and "mail" are
completely separate things.

CMU has for some number of years used a mail system, AMS, which has
message collections with a wide variety of visibility and access
restrictions.  "News" and "mail" are but two extremes of the possible
modes.  There can be collections which are readable by some set of
users and writable by some other, possibly intersecting, set of users.

The Washington "delete" model does not extend to such a system.  It
relies on there being two types of objects: Mail, which is accessable
and writable to exactly one user, and News, which is accessable to
multiple users but writable to none.  Washington's model trains users
to use "delete" in situations where they do not intend to permanently
remove the message.  When such users encounter objects which are
writable and accessable to more than one user, this training will
cause unintentional loss of data.

There are really two modes in which users read messages.  One is a
"show new messages" mode where a user just wants to see the new
messages in all of their subscribed folders, moving to the next folder
when all the messages in the current one are read.  Another is a
"browse" mode, where a user wants to see all messages in a particular
folder.

News readers have historically focused on the "show new message" mode
of reading, becuase it is necessary for dealing with the volume of
data that exist in news.  The news readers I am most familiar with
(rn/trn) tend to ignore "browse" mode, to the point where it is
acutely painful to try to go back and read old news.

Mail readers have historically only dealt with "browse" mode.  They
have not done "show new message" mode because there is usually only
one folder (the inbox) that ever gets new messages.  This folder
usually does not get enough volume to cause a demand for a "show new
message" mode.

In order for a "show new messages" mode to be convenient, two
functions need to be provided: "mark this message as unread" and "mark
all messages as read".

I think it's unfortunate that Terry isn't more aware of AMS.  It has
some serious limitations, but it does in fact handle mail and news the
same.  When one is in "show new message" mode, one's incoming-mail
folders with new messages show up with all the other folders with new
messages.  When one is reading a mail folder, the act of reading a
message once *will* cause the message to not show up ("disappear") the
next time the folder is opened in "show new message" mode.

I have solved my pine 3.90 news posting.  sorry about the previous 
message.  I was using the wrong NNTP server and thus the cause of the 
error message I was getting.

Again I would like to say a job well done to all the PINE and PICO people.

I would like to have several news groups automaticaly subscribed to by my

called subscription that is located in /usr/lib/local/news directory.

Is this a possibility with PINE 3.90?

Well, John and I have been over this ground before without any sign of
convergence of our views, but just in case others are interested in the
debate, I'll annotate his comments to emphasize that I reject both the
characterization and the conclusion...

To the contrary, it is indicative of providing a consistent view of both,
subject to the unfortunate limitations of .newsrc files.  (At least half 
of our disagreement would evaporate if we could store one more bit of
per-message state in the .newsrc file.)

This is also my view of the world.

Nonsense.

Marking a message as "Deleted" is the way a user tells the system that 
they have no further interest in a message.  Deletion is a user-relative 
operation, it is not absolute.  For example, in a system that implements a 
mailstore as a database, if I delete a message, I in fact only delete a 
link to that message, just as "rm" in a Unix filesystem does not actually
delete a file unless mine is the last link to it.

John's contention is that: because Pine allows you to use a key marked
"Delete" in cases where you don't have the ability to actually zap the
data, then it will cause you to use "Delete" recklessly in cases where you
can. Obviously we disagree.  John favored disabling "D" for news and
having a separate "Junk" command in newsgroups to indicate that you don't
care about the message anymore.  We preferred to keep things consistent
between the two worlds, since we reject the thesis that one's mental model
and motivation for using "D" suddenly changes when one discovers that
"D,X" commands can be undone in certain kinds of folders without having to
call Operations. We considered changing the key label in folders where the
user had no write-access from "Delete" to "Dismiss" (paralleling the
change of "eXpunge" to "eXclude"), but it didn't seem that useful a
change. 

Where I think John and I would agree is that when users have write access
to shared folders it is imperative that they understand that their actions
can affect other people.  But this point is not a result of Pine's
newsreading behavior; it is just as important for people who have only
been exposed to private mail folders previously and never imagined that
their "D,X" in a shared folder might adversely affect someone else.

This view is a bit simplistic.  For one thing, in "browse" mode you
usually want to see only the messages that you have not previously
EXPLICITLY dismissed/deleted/done-in or otherwise dispatched.  This is a
crucial point.  Moreover, not everyone chooses to operate in accordance
with this two-mode model: hybrids predicated on keeping "seen" state and 
msg disposition distinct are certainly possible and, if the usual 
behavior of mailers suits you, preferred...

Agreed.  And this is especially obnoxious if your preferred mode of 
operation is actually a hybrid between the two...  Even before you go 
back, there is an important personal preference issue: in rn/trn you must 
explicitly *recover* messages (via "M") you want to see again, as opposed 
to "dismissing" those you are done with.  For many this is 
counter-intuitive and (in terms of keystrokes) it is also less efficient.

Again, I think this is a simplistic view.  For many people the reason 
mailers don't usually offer a "show only new messages" mode has nothing 
to do with volume.  Nor is a browse or hybrid mode antithetical to 
handling high volume as long as you have a way of deleting/dismissing
the messages you no longer care about.

This is true if and only if you over-load the seen/unseen flag to also
convey the user's intended disposition of the message.  If you keep those
concepts distinct, as Pine tries to do, the needed operations are a little
different.  Still, I agree that both of those functions are useful, and
being able to store seen/unseen status is clearly desirable. This is where
we get into some unfortunate engineering tradeoffs due to the limitations
of the .newsrc format.  Given that compatibility with existing .newsrc
files was an important goal, we had to choose how to use the one bit of
per-message state possible in that file format.  The choice was between
recording seen/unseen status, which changes implicitly by viewing a
message (and *maybe* as a result of explicit manipulation), *OR* recording
the user's explicit intention about the future utility and dispostion of 
that particular message, namely the
deleted/dismissed/junked/whatever-term-you-prefer status bit. 

There is no question in my mind that "seen" status and disposition should
be kept distinct, and that recording a user's *explicit* statement about
the disposition of a message is more important than recording a state
change triggered implicitly by viewing.  Obviously I'm not impressed by
the argument that one can overload and explicitly manipulate the
seen/unseen flag in order to record the user's intended disposition of a
message.  Combining these two very different characteristics of a message
into one flag is is a terrible hack and one that is contrary to the way
Pine handles mail.  So I would love to have seen/unseen state available AS
WELL... and next year we plan to implement a .newsrc successor for those
who don't need cross-tool compatibility, and then we can have all msg 
status flags available even for R/O folders.

To each his/her own.  For me that behavior is be sufficient grounds to
not use AMS.  I have used that mode for well over a decade and am 
delighted that I don't have to put up with it anymore.  (It drives me 
crazy to have to explicity mark something to keep it around.)

I have no problem with personal preference options for controlling views,
as long as they apply uniformly to any kind of folder, and when we have
the technology to store sufficient state information for news, I would
have no objection to supporting a "show only new messages" mode in Pine,
(for both mail and news folders, of course), but still preserving the 
distinction between "seen" state and msg disposition.

I have the following problem with all mailers I use and PINE is
no exception... (minor gripe)

I receive mail on a number of topics and file them away in various
folders according to the subject matter. When I come to reply to
any of this mail I would DEARLY like the reply carbon-copy to be
saved in my current folder and not in "sent-mail".

Can this be configured? If not can we have this as an option in a
future release?

Regards, Paul.

My first suggestion is to cut it down to 4/5 lines - that's a monster!
Secondly, replace each tab with 8 spaces so there's no "strange"

	Damn, I did just type you a reply, but the system went down for a
minute or two, so I lost it! Anyway, I only compiled Pine last night, so I
haven't really had a good look at it yet, but I think the feature that
you're after is called 'enable-jump-shortcut'. Hit 's', followed by 'c',
from the main menu, and choose this option from the list, and you should
be able to just hit the number of the message you want to jump to, as you
described.

OK, I got that last permission problem solved and now I have another one.

When I go into pine, I get a beep and a message saying...

The program seems to run fine but this error is annoying. Any idea what

And if there are 500 to 1000 unread articles in the group you want to

sound like such a hot solution.

Date: Fri, 9 Sep 1994 09:39:19
Message-Id: <theall1.501.0009A812@mail.tju.edu>

I grabbed the latest release of PC Pine (v3.90 beta) and am having trouble 
with it. My system is a 486 running Windows 3.1, DOS 6.00, PC/TCP v2.2 with 
v1.10 of their Winsock.DLL, and the Win32s extension v1.15a.

First off, I like it! I have it configured so I can read mail located on 
several hosts, both new and those already in folders, and even read news.  
However, whenever I try to *send* mail, the hourglass comes up and stays up.  
I left my machine along for 20 minutes once before using the three-fingered 
salute to shutdown the window. 

I have been testing several other mail clients on this machine and can 
indeed send mail with them so I doubt it's the smtp host configuration.

Anyone else experiencing this or similar problems?  I suspect the win32s 
extension.

There have been a few messages about this from people. As I said in one 
I've been having the same problem using the PC-NFS TCP/IP stack (version 
5.0 and 5.1) but all works fine with the Beame & Whiteside version. So 
far, no response from the Pine Development team as far as I'm aware.

A little bug note for the Winsock versions of Pine and Pico: if you use 
the enable function keys command then F10 can't do what it is supposed to 
do because under Windows rules it activiates the menu bar.

Hi,
	
	I'm looking for the Pine "secrets" document posted earlier to the 
group.  Unfortunately, it expired at my site before I grabbed it.  If 
anyone has it and could forward it to me, it would be greatly 
appreciated!  Thanks in advance.

George,

I have PC-PINE working (thanks to all who sent suggestions in making it 
work) on my 386 running Windows 3.1, DOS 6.0, Pathworks V4.1 (for DecNet) 
and use Trumpet's Winsock.DLL.  I also have the Win32s extension v1.15a.

When I send mail, it goes immediately.

I know this doesn't help your problem, but it might suggest that Win32s 
is not the problem.:(

	How about the sequence:

	; a a d

	; = Select

	a = all

	a = apply 

	d = "delete" (deselect)

I once asked the Pine authors about this, and they said that they had 
personally not had a need for it and so they did not have any feature 
like this built into Pine.  Now, I think it would be great, because text 
compresses so well and many of us are short on disk space.  If people 
sent to the pine authors, and expressed their desire for this, then maybe 
it would get put in.  Let them know!

Just to clarify some points about my position:

Terry Gray <gray@cac.washington.edu> writes:

I do favor disabling "D" for news, however a separate "Junk" command
was put forward as a compromise between our two positions.  When it
became obvious the attempted compromise was not working, the "Junk"
idea was dropped.

As for my descriptions of the "browse" and "show new messages" modes
being simplistic, I did gloss over some points for brevity.  In both
modes, one may want to apply a filter so that one only sees an
interesting subset of the messages.  In "browse" mode, one typically
has a filter to only show messages which have not been marked for
deletion.

One can view "show new messages" mode as an instance of "browse" mode
where one has a filter applied to only show messages which have not
been marked as being read.  (For usability, one may want this
particular filter applied only once upon entry to the folder, instead
of continuously being applied as messages change state.)  A good UI
would allow the user to remove/reapply this filter, easily popping
between the two modes.

In this model, the act of reading a message does not automatically
cause it to disappear when the folder is read in "browse" mode.  It
just causes it to be filtered the next time the folder is read in
"show new messages" mode.  I thus entirely disagree with Terry's
characterization of this model as "overloading" the Seen flag.  I
think this view comes from the fact that rn/trn doesn't *have* a
"browse" mode--one can't get rid of the filter.

Howdy All,

I've got an easy question: I'd like to specify emacs (without X) as my 
alternate editor.  (FWIW, my reason is that I login from home via modem 
and I don't want to have to mess with my default work setup.)

I've tried setting my default editor as: 

  unset DISPLAY; emacs

with various quoting schemes, but it doesn't appear to work.  Is this 
something that should?

cheers,
john

Is there a return receipt feature in Pine 3.90?

By this I mean can you indicate when you compose a message that you want 
to be notified by email that the receiver has read the message?

   Is the a Pine FAQ or user info beyond the built in help and info in 
the .pinerc file? I looked at an FAQ site but couldn't find anything.
My specific questions relate to filters (at least right now).   
   When my serive provider updgraded to 3.9 the application asked if I
would like more information. I said yes, but since then (8 days and
counting, this time) incoming mail is mostly down. If you reply by mail
please use one of the address in my signature, not my return address. 
   
  Thanks Ralph

I thought this was going to be a feature also.
Oh well, you can always add your own receipt header line to the header 
(using the customize header option):

Return-Receipt-To: dryfoos@ll.mit.edu
Registered-Mail-Reply-Requested-By: dryfoos@ll.mit.edu

Above are header lines for delivery receipt and read receipt.
Of course, whether these work or not depend on the receiving mailer.

Good luck.

This may be a clunky way of doing it, but what I did was set the Fcc 
option in the addressbook for various addresses to a Folder-sent file. 
For instance, any mail I send to pine-info is saved in Pine-sent 
automatically. If you want, I suppose you could just set it to Pine (for 
example). Personally I like to keep my outgoing messages separate, 
although I does add a bit more clutter to the screen.

For anything you don't want to go to a specific folder set the 
fcc-name-rule to one of the following: by-recipient, last-fcc-used, 
default-fcc.

Hi,

I am experiencing some strange behavior with Pine and IMAP in case of one 
particular folder. Before I started using IMAP, I was reading my folders 
simply through NFS and everything was as expected. Now, I starting using 
IMAP and one of my folders has suddenly turned READONLY.

What makes a folder to be read-only? I know of one case and that's when 
there are multiple Pine instances accessing the same folder through IMAP.

However, there are no multiple instances of Pine running and the folder in 
question is in the same directory as all of my other folders. The 
file mode settings as well as the .pinerc settings for this folder are
just like any other folder I am using.

I have tried mtest to see if it could shed some light on this but it did not
provide any further information.

Anybody who has some idea of what I could test further or knows what is 
going on, please mail me.




Richard.

I tried to use Pine 3.90 to post new on my Netcom account.  I failed.
I posted a query on a local netcom newsgroup and got the following 
reply:

Does this mean that pine is only set up to post via NNTP, and it will 
not allow to post directly on one's local machine?  Somehow, I find this 
hard to believe.

Subject: addressbook item dumping core
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

I have been playing with version 3.9 (on both SunOS and Solaris machines)
and have run into a problem with my addressbook.  The entries were bogus
(made up for testing) but this never happened in 3.89.  In the compose
window, if I put the test2 (see below) entry in the CC it would
dump core with a arithmatic exception.  The last time it dumped, it
wiped out my whole address book and it came up the next time with the initial
message as though I had never before started it up.  The offending entries
looked *something* like:

test	anothertest
test2	test2		DISTRIBUTION LIST
			julie@soest.hawaii.edu
			jfkdlajdksa
			green
			test
			postmaster@soest.hawaii.edu
			fjkfui
test3	test3		DISTRIBUTION LIST
			j.jirikowic
			dummy
			dummy2

This is not identical because, as I said, the whole thing was trashed
and I created it months ago.  Any ideas?

The first time you run Pine 3.90 you will be prompted to request the Pine
Secrets document.  We would prefer that you obtain it that way.

The Pine FAQ was last posted to comp.mail.pine on August 29th.  It has not
yet been posted to other newsgroups (I was hoping for some feedback... :)

George, I'm using v3.90 and also have all the other things installed 
you mention, with the exception that I'm using Windows for 
Workgroups tcp/ip (1st official release version).  I have win32s 
v1.15a installed, and MS-DOS 6.20.  Perhaps it doesn't like something 
in PC/TCP's winsock??

About the only way to do that now is to copy a short .newsrc file to each

hi I'm new to pine and I seem to be having a problem with it
we use sendmail with db and we use the first.last names to send the mail
out, however pine refuses to send them out that way. Elm sends it out right
too. 
Any ideas what I'm supposed to do?

I found that if I remove or rename the .pinerc file, that Pine will ask you if you want this 
document again.

Alternatively:  "pine -p foo" will achieve the same result (except for 
the side-effect of creating a file called "foo").

However: make sure that you don't need to have "user-domain" set in your
pinerc in order for your "From: " address to be correct.  Normally this
will be set in the global pine.conf, so *most* folks will be OK, but we
are seeing that a number of attempts to send the document have failed
because of bogus return addresses.

I, too, think this would be wonderful.

Better yet, however, would be an on-the-fly file 
compression/decompression (using gzip a/o compress) for unix that a user 
can just set up in his/her login sequence. Anyone know of any?

I got this message after upgrading from unix pine 3.89 to 3.90 on a Linux 
system.  It seemed to be complaining about the old 3.89 global 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf file.  I renamed a new .pinerc file and replaced 
the old one, and that seemed to have fixed it.

Subject: 3.90 Addressbook Incompatability
Date: 10 Sep 1994 01:08:08 GMT
Message-Id: <34r0to$ga5@ns.oar.net>

We just upgraded from unix pine 3.89 to 3.90 on our Linux systems (kernels
1.0 and 1.1.34).  Everything seems fine except the new version will not
properly use the old .addressbook, even though it *says* it is opening it. 
It shows the addressbook to be empty.  The new version also creates an
.addressbook.lu file which seems to contain a string of numbers. 

What's going on?  Is there a way to convert the older 3.89 .addressbook 
for use in 3.90?  Or is there some subtle configuration that I've 
missed?  (n.b. the brief status message *says* it is using the proper 
~/.addressbook file)

	You know....since there is no standard....since (thankfully) pine
seeks to adhere to standards it is great to see that they didn't include
anything on this *mis-feature*.

	I wonder what recognizes "Registered-Mail-Reply-Requested-By:" ????

	Now can you just see all the posts you would see if the pine team
were to include such a *mis-feature*?  "I put that header in and I sent
mail to 30,000 people and I never got a reply!!!"

	I doubt that anyone needs to have "confirmation" (and I use that
word very loosely).  The "best" receipt request you can use is a very
simple......"Let me know you got this..." in the body of your message.

George,
A nasty bug in 3.90 has just been tracked down.  If there are any blank 
lines in the addressbook file, Pine does bad things to it.

(If this does not explain the problem you are experiencing, please send 
additional details to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu)

-teg

p.s. I've CC'd "pine-announce" rather than "pine-info" to disseminate 
this information as widely as possible.

	"pine -p /dev/null" works fine too...and doesn't foo you.  :-)

For those interested, Pine does indeed exist (in beta form) as a Windows 
application.  It comes with PC Pico too.

Like much other pine-related material, you can retrieve a copy from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  The windows version is available as:
pcpine_w.zip in /pine/pcpine.

I saw this when I had defined a read-message-folder. Undefine it
and it goes away. I filed a bug report and they know about it - fixed
in 3.91

After reading mail, how can I make the mail as unread again?  
The reason I ask is because if I read it first with the telnet way and later 
check it with Eudora, the Eudora won't recognize the read mail as new mail 
anymore?  Is there any way to solve this other than not checking with telnet 
first?  I know there should be some other way, but I don't know how.

You could save it by the day, week, or month then tar cvf -o Oct.files 
and and the end of the period gunzip -c *.files for max compression and 
you got it all.

	How about setting up an alias for a non-existant editor, (or emacs 
client), and have the alias invoke emacs in the way you require? Can't 
say it will work, but is simple enough to set up.

	I'm not sure I know what you mean by "the telnet way".

	But, assuming you are talking about pine......

	You can used *(Flag) n(new).

	This will cause the Status: header to change from

Status: RO

	to

Status: O

	Hope this helps....

	You don't have to SHOUT!!

	First, you seem to be unreachable....

	Second, you don't want the "flag" command.

	You want the ;(Select) command and the a(Apply) command.

	You type ;(Select) then choose the criteria.

	Once you've done that you type a(Apply) and the s(save).

	OK?

	Now best get your link fixed.....and stop shouting at all these
nice, helpful people.

This seems reasonable as a default to me.
But I would like to be able to tailor my Mail/news reader to
do automatic-delete-when-seen. This should be on a pr. folder 
basis, as I would like to do this on some of my mail-folders
and most of the newsgroups I read.

We just installed Pine 3.90 after a fairly painless build under SCO Unix
(uname details: Release = 3.2v4.2, KernelID = 93/04/28, Machine = Pentium,
BusType = ISA).  Compiler is gcc 2.5.8 in -O2 mode. 

Everything seems to work fine except for the Addressbook section, which
treats all addressbooks as read only, doesn't update the screen when the
cursor moves to select other entries, and doesn't list the usual two rows
of command keys at the bottom of the screen.  The previous version we 
ran was 3.87 with no problems.

Your prompt attention to this will help us appease our subscriber base.
Let me know how I can be of assistance in helping to address this problem.

Kenny,

If you get an example could you send me a copy?  I would like to figure out
how to set it up so I could file attach a tif file like a fax and have the
receiving end be able to view it and do whatever they want with it after 
that,
store it pitch it, whatever.

thanks.

Steve

I am not so sure I would consider this a bug.  In normal newsreaders, f is
followup, which means forward to the news group.  I find it rather confusing
to have to remember different mnemonics for different tools, and I have a
newsreader I am very happy with, but this kind of key-binding stuff ought to
be user configurable, or offer different compatibility sets, such as lynx
does for vi or emacs compatibility.  In news readers you generally 'm' to
send the current article to another user.  How does one currently followup a
posting with pine?

There is no confusing modality in nn:  if the folder being looked at is
entered as a file, such as your saved news or mail folder, then all articles
are shown, on the other hand, if the folder is in the news spool (either in
a local spool area or through nntp), it treats the articles as excluded once
you have seen them.

I am not sure what the behavior is here, since I still use nn, but I take it
to mean that pine continues to show you all the articles in the spool unless
you actively expunge them?  If that is so, please make this a configuration
issue rather than a "design issue".  Pine already has to be able to tell the
difference between a news spool and a save folder, allow us to treat them
differently.  It has been so much easier to introduce new users to pine than
elm as an MUA.  I think continuing to present already read articles in the
news spool area is mildly brain-damaged behavior.  Please make this
configurable.

There is a very real cognitive difference here between mail and news:  the
default assumption when looking at my mailbox is that the articles are to me
and may be of some interest to me, while the default assumption for news is
that the articles are broadcast and are probably of no interest to me.  It
is reasonable to have to actively discard messages that are for me, but I
should have to actively save messages that are broadcast.

The problem with this is that if I do not explicitly save something in the
news spool it will expire and be gone whether I wish it to or not.  On the
other hand, if I do not explicitly save something in my mail spool, it will
stay around until the sysadmin notices my mailspool is going over 25M again.

The main problem with Terry's argument as I understand it is that the
default system treatment of the respective spools for news and mail is
different, there the user needs to know that if shee does not store an
article from news into a folder *it WILL go away*.  We do not need two state
bits in newsrc, we simply need to know whether we are reading from a spool
or from a folder and that we are reading news, which we already know or we
would not be able to deal with the news message format.  The assumption with
a folder or a mail spool is that messages will stay around.  The assumption
with a news spool has to made aware to the user.  If she doesn't save it it
will no longer be available.  Once it is saved, it is in a folder, and
deleting from a folder needs to be explicit.

There is another issue:  I read most of my mail, but only about 10% of the
articles in any of the dozens/hundreds of newsgroups I read.  I simply do
not have the time to reread *OR* mark as eXclude the messages or message
headers of the tens of 1000's of articles I choose not to read in these
groups in a week.

You already have to pieces of state information: news or mail? and spool or
folder?  unless I am sorely mistaken.

Please make this configurable.

One way to beat this is to indent the quote character in your editor, or
change the quote character.  I changed the default quote character in nn to
prepend a space.  Now I do not get that error any more. ;)

This was a feature when uucp was slow and expensive.  When TCP/IP became
cheap, it did not matter as much.  Now that low-price unlimited-connect
TCP/IP dialups are getting expensive again, I guess it might be a feature
again.

Another possible good solution is to encourage users to setup for news with

Your question would best be answered by NetManage, the folks who
support the Chameleon package.  I'd hazard a guess that the flags
used to mark new messages in pine differ from those used by the
other mail interface.

Stew,
Your assumptions may be correct for your particular site, but they are 
not correct for everyone.  Some sites expire incoming mail in lieu of 
having hard quotas on mail servers.  And some newsgroups at some sites 
are never expired.

Likewise, many people subscribe to email lists that have identical 
"content" properties as the news groups you read (i.e. messages probably of 
less importance), and some sites use newsgroups to convey very critical 
information that is as important as any mail message.

Mail and news transport are alternative technologies for delivering messages.
Period.  For tool-builders, it is a mistake to ascribe fundamentally 
different properties to them, even though for any particular user's 
patterns of use your assumptions may be valid.

1.  Go the the Main Menu
2.  Go to Setup
3.  Go to Configure
4.  See the line: nntp-server            = 
5.  Place the cursor on that line and use "a" to add an entry.
6.  Add the host name of your NNTP server...

Every time I launch Pine 3.90, I get a message inviting me to continue
composing a message that was interrupted -- probably left over when my
server cut me off in the middle of a message. When I hit "yes" (just to
call the bugger up and get rid of it), it informs me that the folder is
empty and there is really no message to continue composing. And I still
get the "continue composing" message every time I go into Pine. How can
I rid myself of this pest?

Hi, Last time someone who was very kind showed told me to do "(flag) n(new)" 
on pine to remark already read-mail to unread/new mail.  But because I'm not 
well versed with PINE, could someone tell me specifically how I can do that 
after loading PINE?  

Thank you in advance.

I am able, with the same SCO software running on a 486/EISA, to properly 
use all the addressbook functions, and I have no screen drawing 
problems.  You might try doing a clean rebuild of the whole system, just 
in case there were any irregularities in compiling the addressbook 
function modules (I think there are two files involved).  You might also 
try using the stock SCO C compiler, if you've got it, to see if there's 
any difference in compiled versions.  If you don't have the stock SCO C 
compiler, and you feel like trusting me, you can pick up the binary I 
built from soils.agron.iastate.edu in /pub/sco/unix/pine.

I can assure you that this is not a bug in Pine per se, but in something 
strange about the environment you built under.  Since the problems are in 
the Addressbook functions, alphabetically the first block of modules, 
there might have been some problem early on in the compilation process 
which was resolved later.  Did you interrupt your compile and restart it 
later?  Anyway, a clean rebuild will fix any of those problems.

Keep me posted, I'm always glad to help.

I installed the Winsock version of PC-Pine and answered the prompts when 
I first started it.  I was never prompted for a password and when it 
tried connecting to my inbox on one of our Sun workstations the 
connection was refused.  Since the Technical Notes mentioned a pine.pwd 
file I created one of those in the same directory as my pinerc file.  I 
even put my password in the file, even though the Technical Notes 
indicated that the password is stored in that file in an encrypted 
format, but got no further.  The Technical Notes don't tell me how to get 
my password into the file and I can't find information elsewhere on how 
to do it.  What do I need to do?  I don't see why it would matter, but I 
am running Windows NT.

Jim,
Pine won't prompt you for credentials until after it has established a 
connection to the IMAP server.  Are you sure that the Sun is running an 
imapd?  You can test this with the command
  telnet <hostname> 143

If you don't get a "connection refused", enter ". logout" to terminate the 
imap session.  If you *do* get a "connection refused" you need to arrange 
to get an imap server running on your mail host.  Ours is available as
part of the Pine distribution (/pine/pine.tar.Z) or in the /pine/unix-bin
directory on ftp.cac.washington.edu

Incidentally: I don't know if you used Pine or a different program to post
your inquiry, but please fix your configuration asap to have a valid
"user-domain".  On the msg you posted your return address said: 
   Jim Cameron <cameron@osi540sn>
which is not a valid address.

Mr. Daviel,
	
	Does this mean that the read-messages folder option doesn't work
in 3.90?
	I've configured our /usr/local/lib/pine.conf to auto place all 
users messages in read-messages, but they can override that by defining 
read-messages as "".
	A lot of our users find the read-messages option to be very 
useful.  
	I'd hate to have to remove it.  We're using 3.89 until this 
issue's hopefully resolved by 3.91.

	If I did a pine -conf > pine.conf (with pine 3.90) and 
re-entered: read-messages=read-messages, would it work?

After I reported that I saw the same Append instead of Overwrite 
behaviour on the aix-a32-bin from washington as I got on my 
locally compiled version, Burt Heymanson sent me a version he 
compiled. 

I did not get the same behaviour on his version. 

However, when I went *back* to the other versions and did the same 
exact thing, they also did an overwrite when asked. 

I had tested it more than once before I sent my "me too" reply
about observing the behaviour, so I guessed that it may have 
been something different about the exact sequence of operations: 
for example, whether I was in the INDEX or message VIEW mode. 

However, after trying several different combinations, I was unable
to repeat the same mis-behaviour. 


  Does anyone else still observer this bug ?
( And, did I hear somebody say "Phase of the Moon?" )

  [ the enclosure file in charset=US-ASCII; BASE64 encoding ] 


The enclosed file has no non-ascii chars.
( None visable to the eye, and I double checked and tested it
  for chars < ' ' and |= '\n'  or > '\176' ) 

And my Setup shows charset set to US-ASCII. 

Why is it getting encoded ? 
And, if it's getting encoded at all, why not QUOTED-PRINTABLE, 
which would at least be readable to the MIME impaired ?

I'm going to serve as a moderator for a newsgroup, and I was wondering if 
I could use Pico to edit and post news articles.  And, if so, how?  I 
have been trying to use Pico by itself, i.e., without using it through 
Pine3.90, and I have been having problems.  Do you have any suggestions 
for how I could do this, or info. that I could read on it?

Pine Base64-encodes all attachments, including text, in order to assure
that they are not modified in transit.  The goal is make sure file
attachment in Pine is as dependable as FTP (and B64 is safer than QP). 
A good example of why this is handy is when we recently asked some folks to
attach their addressbooks to help us track down problems in 3.90, we
didn't have to worry about whether a gateway had modified a tab or
trailing blanks, etc, etc.

For the (hopefully temporarily) MIME impaired, the idea is that you should 
*include* the text via ^R rather than attaching it.  In a future release 
we may investigate the feasibility of providing a sub-command under ^R to
trigger an in-line MIME inclusion using QP.

Date: 11 Sep 1994 00:43:35 -0700
Message-Id: <34ucf7$bjl@crl.crl.com>

   I an account with a PPP vendor on which I am known as 
`pp000547@interramp.com'.

   From my PC (running pine3.89 on linux) I am able to send mail to 
`pp000547@interramp.com' and by using the Windows software that came 
with my subscription to interramp,com I am able verify that 
the mail I am sending from my PC is arriving at "the post office" on 
interramp.com by retrieving it.

   However, I am not able to retrieve mail that is sitting in my
`pp000547@interramp.com' mailbox using `pine' on the Linux side of my PC. 

   1) I created a user named `pp000547'.

   2) The only changes I made to the pine.conf built into `pine' are the 
following:

             user-domain=interramp.com

             smtp-server=smtp.interramp.com

    Now if I login as `pp000547' and _send_ mail (say, to crl.com) that
mail arrives as coming `From: pp000547@interramp.com' -- which is what I
was counting on to make it possible for me to retrieve it (running Linux). 

   Is it impossible for me to do what I am trying to do and, if not, what 
else do I have to do to be able to do it?

   Thanks!

   Bill

Just delete the folder "interrupted-mail", which is created by Pine when

One of my users (the one with the strongest anti-technology aura) 
requested the doc a week or so ago and received an error message from the 
server saying "disk full".  I deleted her .pinerc so she can re-request 
it when she logs back in next time.

Ever notice how there are some users who, through no fault of their own,
will be hit by *every* little bug and glitch there is?  Really, I'm almost

...this has been asked locally.
  
I was told that in Pine no option exists to set a header Reply To:, as is 
used in mailing groups.  It was suggested that Elm has such a setting.
  
It was also suggested that one could "type in Reply to: and that which 
should follow" and that would work.
  
I have RTFM and didn't find the answer.  And, I have not yet experimented.
  
Thanks in advance for any info on this...

The header customization options _is_ the way the feature was implemented! 
Since there is no standardized way to request such receipts, all we can do is

This is a known limitation that will be addressed after IMAP4 support is
added (Pine 4.0?)

You are correct that Pine can only post via NNTP.  Adding local posting is on
out to-do list....

The zero-length mbox not being recognized bug is fixed in Pine 3.91.  I 
believe that I sent you a patch for this for Pine 3.90.

Message-Id: <34vpfu$3pb@belfort.daimi.aau.dk>

We have PC-Pine 3.90 running on PC's with many different
configurations. It works fine except for PC with DOS 6.3, there 
PC-Pine 3.90 (both dos and win. versions) won't send mails. When
^X is pressed we get the error:

"Mail not sent. Transfer protocol error: 250... Recipient OK"


We are using FTP Software's PC/TCP 2.2. Pine 3.89 works OK.


What can the reason be for that error. Has anyone else experienced
the same ?

Thanks in advance

Subject: delete in news

Terry will remember that he and I have disagreed quite often about the 
use of delete in news.  Here is an argument in favor of Terry's position.

Suppose there was a format of mail in which messages were stored in
discrete files per message, and in which each recipient obtained a
UNIX-style hard link to the file.  [This format has, in fact, been
implemented in several environments.] The user has a personal state file
to keep track of answered, seen, flagged, etc. status.  The delete
operation, when confirmed by an expunge, removes the hard link. 

I think that one would have a very difficult argument in trying to claim
that delete is not the proper operation for this environment.  This is
clearly a full ``mail'' type environment in the traditional sense.  Yet
the bits are not physically removed from the disk until the very last link
sharer does his own delete/expunge. 

The killer comes in when you realize that this is almost identical to the 
netnews spool, with two minor differences:
 1) it is routine that the system manager periodically purges netnews
    without user action; whereas this is only sometimes done for mail.
 2) long-term seen/answered/flagged status is not maintained

I consider the provision of a feature to make deleted (but still extant) 
message invisible to be a feature of the user interface, and not an 
aspect of the model.

Consider, too, that there is a separate operation that means ``permanent 
removal of deleted messages'' and that that operation is not offered for 
news folders.  Perhaps Pine should make this operation more distinct from 
the operation to make deleted messages invisible, but that is a separate 
discussion.

You can certainly use Pico to edit an article but to post it you 
need a newsreader like Pine 3.90, trn, nn, or tin, or a newsposter 
like Pnews or nnpost.  Most newsreaders/newsposters use either
the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variable to determine what editor
to use.  You can set these in your .login (if you use .csrhc or
.tcshrc) like this:

setenv EDITOR "pico -t -z"
setenv VISUAL "$EDITOR"


The -t flag means to use Pico in tool mode and -z allows you to
use ^z.  I also like to use -w which means don't auto wrap.

Hope this helps,
Nancy

It is stated in Pine Technical Notes Version 3.85 that Pine expects
the following sequences from terminals defined as VT100:

                      ANSI/VT100
              F1:     <ESC>OP
              F2:     <ESC>OQ
              F3:     <ESC>OR
              F4:     <ESC>OS
              F5:     <ESC>Op
              F6:     <ESC>Oq
              F7:     <ESC>Or
              F8:     <ESC>Os
              F9:     <ESC>Ot
              F10:    <ESC>Ou
              F11:    <ESC>Ov

What's the story on F12?  I thought Technical Notes Version 3.90 would 
have the scoop on F12, but no.

Also, in Pine 3.89, <ECS>Oq in the Message Text area (while composing
mail) results in ^W (Whereis), instead of invoking the Alternate Editor. 

Some folks using serial communications software (e.g., Kermit) can't 
press ^K, since Kermit captures this.  Others can't press ^_.  So I 
thought they could run Pine in function key mode.

Any comments?

Thanks!

I think that the default action when leaving a newsgrouop should be
to prompt 'Mark everything as read? (y/n) [y]' and if yes, then marking
everything deleted.

Also if you try to enter a newsgroup that has no unread messages pine
could prompt for 'Show read messages? (y/n/#) [n]' and if yes, display all
(or given number of latest) messages.

Subject: build cvx

Hello all

I compiled pine3.90 on ConvexOS compserv C3860 11.0 convex.

Here's the output from the log file. Could some kind soul tell me
if these warnings are of a serious nature or if I can live with these?

Thanks in advance

We are having this problem at svpal.org, Silicon Valley Public Access
Link.  We're using v3.88 with the Sun OS.  However, it appears to be
happening because of underlying disk space problems.  I'm no techie,
but we have insufficient disk space, and when the disk problem becomes
acute, the system can't write, and .newsrc winds up with a zero length.

> When you notice the
>problem, is there a good copy in .oldnewsrc?

Yes, .oldnewsrc is still okay.  But users don't have shell access,
so we are rebuilding .newsrc the hard way.  Some of the more experienced
users have figured out how to back up .newsrc by downloading it.

I don't think you could call what's happening on our system a bug,
though.  The program is not being allowed to do it's thing because of the
disk problem.

When a certain user of mine tries to forward or reply with the full

the previous message.  This is under Sun 4.1.3 and the user hasn't
nothing set in their .pinerc.  They are using the system default settings
which as far as I know have not caused anyone a problem.  Also, this
user does not have this problem under 3.89,  Any ideas?

Date: 12 Sep 1994 14:32:30 GMT
Message-Id: <HFALKEN.94Sep12163230@x4u2.desy.de>

I look for a way to unset the highlighting mode in the index and want to
use instead an arrow (like in elm; or another prefix sign) or cursor binding 
to see what mail is actually touched. I'm working on a SGI under IRIX. 
For VAX/VMS systems a saw a pine version which uses arrows. So i think
it should be possible for unix system, too. 

The cause is, that I have to support a Braille Ouput Device, which can't
work with screen attributes. So it is in this case not possible to  differ
between the mails in the index. 

If someone can help me, I would be very glad.

Please sende mail to:
hfalken@x4u.desy.de

Thank You in advance
Harald

I read in the pine-ports document that somebody has started a port of Pine for SCO.
Does anybody know how far they have got? How difficult do you think it would
be to make Pine work with SCO?

Billy,
For this user, does it happen for all messages, or just some?

If "just some", please attach a sample in a Bug Report; if "all", we'll
probably need to work with you to figure out some way to trace what's 
going on with his/her particular session.

Ok. I can accept that as a reasonable rationale for that behavior. 
( And now that you've answered it, I recall some previous discussion
 of this on the list, but I wasn't paying attention at the time. Sorry! )

But this just gets back to the request for better MIME support: 
  pine is a pretty good MIME reader, but it's not a very good MIME 
  *composer* (IMHO). 

[ The following comments should all be read with an implicit "as far
  as I can tell" or "Is this true?" - It is quite possible that I've
  just missed "the trick" required. ]

 There is no control over Content-Type or Content-Encoding of inclusions. 

 There is no control over the order of inclusions. They are ordered 
 "LIFO" by default, which is (I think) the wrong default - the reverse
  order from how the message is composed. 

 It would be nice to be able to compose text/plain or message/rfc822 parts
 in between other inclusions, ( or as a nested multipart/parallel ) for 
 example, to mix paragraphs of text explanation with images or other data. 

 And worst of all, there is no way to "manually" compose a mime-message. 
 Pine doesn't tell you what it's going to use as boundary, so you can't 
 just manually insert a mime header. ( Note: I haven't actually tried 
 setting the Content-Type: header manually with the new configure 
 options, but since this is a global changes, it wouldn't be a very good
 solution even if it works. ) 

 In short: Most MIME messages I would like to send, are impossible to 
 *compose* in Pine, and the others, I cannot control their encoding and 
 order. ( So we're getting MIME enabled, but actually being discouraged
 from *using* MIME. ) 


Also - concerning MIME reading/viewing: 

  I note again (in my previous message) that pine labels an 
  included message as both  part "3.0 Message" and "3.1 Text". 
  Is there a reason for this "feature" ? 

  It would be nice if Content-type: Message was recognized on a 
  Save, and "saved" as a message folder, rather than "Exported" 
  as a file, by the Viewer's Save command. 

  Pipe ('|') seems to only pipe the initial part of a multi-part
  message, not the whole thing. One can select a part with View
  and select pipe in the viewer, but there seems to be now way 
  to pipe an entire MIME message. 


I realize these are user interface problems with no simple solutions. 
Adding control would probably mean adding more question, some of 
which would only be confusing for the naive non-MIME initiate. And 
some of these items might require interaction between the editor and
Pine. I wonder, in fact, if it is even *possible* to design a mailer
that's usable for the novice and the advanced feature demanding user. 
( At least, without taking the emacs-like approach of first writing 
 a "language" for writing MUA's, and then writing a simple (but 
extensible) interface in that language. This is, I believe, the 
approach taken by the commercial Z-Mail product. ) 
  However, it's the fact that you guys have done such a good job 
of integrating "advanced" features into 3.90 that makes me so 
demanding. Better MIME support is clearly the next challenge. So 
maybe we need some discussion on what a reasonable user interface 
ought to do. ( And what would be reasonable to expect in 3.92 or 
4.0, and what is really a user interface "research" problem. )

Steve,
We know we have a ways to go on the MIME composing front.  A major next 
step will be to incorporate support for a mime.types file.

As always, thanks for your comments.

I'm fairly new to pine, actually. I have not looked at this exhaustively,
so I couldn't say. I append a message from the pine developers; perhaps
you could contact them directly if you need a fix urgently, and they could
tell you where to change the code.

(I had thought it was to do with auto-move-read-messages, but I think
it is really read-messages-folder that causes the problem).

After discussions in the News and MIME communities on this topic, the
concensus seems to be that sending unencoded 8bit data in News is no more
advisable than it is in Mail.  The News community is lagging somewhat in
adoption of MIME, but I suspect it will soon catch up as the benefits become
apparent....

Content-Description: Retraction and Example

OK: I have to retract one of my assertions: 

Adding "Content-Type" to customized-hdrs in config works:

  If nothing is entered in Rich Header mode, then the normal
  Pine generated default header is used. 
  
  If a value is entered ( for example "multipart/message;  boundary=next-part" )
  then Pine generates duplicate Content-Type headers, but the first is 
  the custom header ( which, I think, (from memory) is the one the 
  standard says should correctly be used. ) and Pine reads the message 
  as intended. 

So, it is possible to "manually" compose an arbitrary MIME message.

The previous message illustrates some of the problems: 

(1) I mis-typed the ending boundary with two trailing "--" instead
of one, and it was unreadable until I performed some surgery. 

(2) My initial test message worked fine, but when I composed this
  one, I postponed it and tried to edit it again before sending. 
   
    (2a) Only the first part of the postponed message is editable. 
    (2b) I think (but I'm not sure) that the act of postponing 
       it may have changed the headers, so the it was not interpreted
       correctly. 

(3) After discovering (2a), I tried, on another message, to change 
   the Content-Type boundary so that I could re-load the entire message
   for editing ( planning on changing it back again later ). This 
   failed utterly - causing me to loose everything except the initial
   part. 

(4) I was *going* to say that postponing the message, and then going 
  to view it in the postponed-msg folder, was a nice way of checking 
  the MIME consistency and legality before sending a "manually" composed
  MIME message. But that's what I did on the bad message I sent out, 
  and it looked good in the Viewer. Could Pine have possibly munged 
  up my ending boundary ? 
   

[ Maybe I'll get back to this experiment later, but I've got some real 
  work to get on with. But I wanted to post my incomplete results, in
  case anyone else wants to try. ]

I've got another little problem with 3.90 on a Sun running SunOS 4.1.3: I 
have my configuration setup to save all read messages to ~/INBOX on 
exit.  When I exit pine, I get a message something like:

 ``Bug in pine detected: Abort signal received, exiting''

Has anyone else out there noticed this?

 If I specify the inbox path to "/u/$USER/...." pine don't recognize it. A feature
 which existed in 3.89. Ofcourse I can specify the full-path name but I'm just curious.

 Also if you start up pine3.90 and then use pine3.89 and then 3.90 it simply refuses
 to read the ".addressbook".

[... and I forgot to mention... ]

(5) "Content-Type:" header is too many chars and shows up in the Compose 
header window  as "Content-" ( But since I'm not likely to add 
"Content-Transfer-Encoding:" to the customized-hdrs list, I can
live with that. )

I also have the same request as michael@APlatform.com.  

For various reasons, we have a wrapper (C-shell) script for pine that
eventually execs Pine's binary.  Rather than follow David's advice to
create the .newsrc for each user when the account is created, the script
now contains the following code which essentially creates the .newsrc file
when it is needed.  It references /usr/local/lib/pine.subscriptions which
is where I chose to put the names of the default newsgroups. 

set newsrcfile = ~/.newsrc
if ( ! -f $newsrcfile ) then
   set subscriptionsfile = /usr/local/lib/pine.subscriptions
   if ( -f $subscriptionsfile ) then
      set pinercfile = ~/.pinerc
      grep "^nntp-server *= *nntphost.dur.ac.uk" $pinercfile >& /dev/null
      set serverstatus = $status
      grep "^news-collections *=.*nntphost.dur.ac.uk" $pinercfile >& /dev/null
      set folderstatus = $status
      if ( $serverstatus == 0 || $folderstatus == 0 ) then
         cp $subscriptionsfile $newsrcfile
      endif
   endif
endif

Yuk!  BTW, I'd be grateful for any holes in the logic (but I don't want
any comments along the line of "why is this in the C-shell?"). 

The other possibility I thought of was to alter the code of Pine at an
appropriate point.  My view is that it could be done where .newsrc gets
created.  This is just before the call of close(i) in function
nntp_read_sdb in imap/non-ANSI/c-client/nntpcunx.c, but I ducked doing
that way. 

Like michael@APlatform.com, I'd like to see some this facility in a later
issue of Pine.

To answer my own question: YES. 

  On postponed messages that are resumed, Pine *does* change the 
Content-Type field and does something to the ending boundary. 
It also seems to append an extra "-" . Is this perhaps a
safety feature to "escape" text that looks like a boundary ? 
It also seems to get confused by existing multiple Content-Type
headers, and automatically constructs a new default like 
"Content-Type: multipart/mixed; TEXT/PLAIN" or something else 
equally strange. 


 You can (^O) postpone a message, and GOTO postponed-msgs and VIEW the
message, and verify that you have constructed a valid MIME message,
but you cannot (easily) edit that message. You have to use BOUNCE 
or FORWARD to send it out once it has been postponed. If you try
to edit it and send it out, Pine will send out an illegal MIME 
message. ( Invalid Content-Type and no closing boundary. ) 


  You can REEDIT the Content-Type header, inserting a new (unused)
boundary, postpone the message again, resume it with Compose, 
and re-edit the header (put back the old boundary), the munged ending 
boundary, and possibly the initial section. ( The initial boundary 
seems to get stripped by this procedure, so your original initial
part will become the "invisible" MIME prologue. ) 


 i.e. not impossible, but it can be a bit messy!

Content-Description: Retraction and Example

OK: I have to retract one of my assertions: 

Adding "Content-Type" to customized-hdrs in config works:

  If nothing is entered in Rich Header mode, then the normal
  Pine generated default header is used. 
  
  If a value is entered ( for example "multipart/message;  boundary=next-part" )
  then Pine generates duplicate Content-Type headers, but the first is 
  the custom header ( which, I think, (from memory) is the one the 
  standard says should correctly be used. ) and Pine reads the message 
  as intended. 

So, it is possible to "manually" compose an arbitrary MIME message.

You need to use "/u/${USER}/...." (the '{}' is necessary when the variable

Try this:

    "/u/${USER}/..."

That's what I had to do for our system (DG/UX 5.4.201).

Apologies to everyone who is getting tired of seeing the same message from 
Steve... The last posting was an unexpected side-effect of me Resending
the message to myself, and not realizing that the msg already contained a 
Resent-To: pine-info...

(This is arguably a bug in either sendmail or Pine, but it may be tough to
fix, since I don't think RFC822 specifies any significance to header
ordering.)

Please forgive this VERY newbie question. My sys admin has recently

/usr/pkg/mail/bin directory where pine is kept. I want to update to PINE 
3.90 from 3.89 and I know that 3.90 is available via FTP. If someone can 
tell which file I need to get and how to decompress or whatever else I 
have to do, please e-mail me. My server is a Sun 670 MP (sparc) running 
SVR4 (SunOS 5.3). TIA.

Yup, the read-msg-folder variable triggers a bug in Pine 3.90.  This will 
be fixed in Pine 3.91.

This also happens to me with Pathworks 5's Winsock and vanilla Windows. 
I was blaming Pathworks' winsock, which has caused some other problems; 
sounds like it affects some other winsocks out there as well.

Also, some folks may have been confused by some references I made to a 
malformed MIME message I sent out. It seems to have gone out on the 
mailing list, but it looks like it was dropped from News distribution.

I was sure I recalled some mention in rfc1521 about how to interpret 
multiple occurrences of the same header. But searching thru the document,
I can't find any such note. Just my overactive imagination ? 
( I also failed to find a note on this in 822, but I only skipped thru
them both quicky, and tried searching for "duplicate" and a half dozen
other likely words. ) 

Is there a rule to resolve the interpretation of:

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN
Content-Type: MULTIPART/MESSAGE 


since it is possible to generate duplicate fields with Pine, and 
I expect with other mail software ( especially automatic gateways,
remailers, etc. ). Or is this defined as illegal ? Or is it just
undefined ? 


Except for the cases where it manufactured the malformed 
Content-Type: header lines, Pine appears to use the first 
occurence and ignore later ones. 


I was also seem to have acquired the folk belief that *all* To:'s 
are significant, but I expect that I'm just overgeneralizing some 
past experience with sendmail.  :-)

Just FYI those of you who are (like me) running AIX 3.2.3...
For whatever miraculous reason, I was able to BUILD pine 3.90 on my AIX
3.2.3 system and it appears to run without problems!

For those of you saying, "so...?"  pine 3.89 built on the *same* system
would explode and leave big core droppings everywhere!  (I was limited
to the pre-built binaries privided by the pine team, and I *do* feel
better when I can build it myself.)

Pine Team:  whatever you did -- THANKS!

Does pine have Certified mail capabilities?  For example, Is there any way
to verify whether or not an E-mail message reaches its destination either
through pine or sendmail?

Please respond via e-mail also.

    Can PC PINE 3.9 be configured to use more than the usual 24 line
screen? Even when I start pine from DOS using a larger (40 line)
screen it uses only the first 24 lines. Note that unix pine will
use more than 24 lines. Is PC PINE fixed to 24 lines? Thanks.

I had a few pico questions I wanted to throw out. I got most of the 
faculty here to dump emacs in favor of pico. It is just great. But, I 
have a few questions:

Is there a way to move to the top and bottom of a file quickly?

Is there a .picorc file? I want to be able to replace tabs with spaces. I 
can do this for emacs with a .emacs file. Can anyone suggest the same for 
Pico. BTW, we use pico 2.1, but will be moving to 2.4 very soon.

The only way to do that is to ask the recipient to let you know they
read your message.  Your sending system cannot know what the receiving
system does with your message, not really.

Subject: Use "Reply to:" address instead of "From:"
Date: 12 Sep 1994 21:38:47 GMT
Message-Id: <352hp7$f2m@dartvax.dartmouth.edu>

Could Pine be changed so that it doesn't ask the user 

	Use "Reply to:" address instead of "From:" address?  

Or at the very least, could this behavior be made site-configurable?
When given this choice, our users have no idea which address they
should use.  (And rightly so -- it's not their job to be able to
recognize valid e-mail addresses at a glance).  So they guess, and they
have a 50% of guessing wrong.

Furthermore, RFC 822 states clearly that the Reply-To field should be
used if it exists:

     4.4.4.  AUTOMATIC USE OF FROM / SENDER / REPLY-TO

        For systems which automatically  generate  address  lists  for
        replies to messages, the following recommendations are made:

            o   If the "Reply-To" field exists, then the reply  should
                go to the addresses indicated in that field and not to
                the address(es) indicated in the "From" field.

Andy,
In a perfect world I would completely agree with you.
Alas, the email world is far from perfect...

The problem that necessitated this property of Pine is LISTSERV. 
In particular, the fact that the normal default for LISTSERV lists is to 
set the Reply-To: value to the list address.  Without a way to ignore the 
Reply-To, there is no way to respond just to the originator, and the risk 
of inadvertently sending an embarrassing reply to a large number of 
people is very high... even with experienced email users.  I speak from 
experience.

The error messages are not serious and pine seems to work or. I'm running
pine3.90 on ConvexOs 10.2.

There is a known bug that is temporarilly fixed by compiling c-client
using Convex cc by adding '-string read_write' to CFLAGS. You can do it
by changing c-client/Makefile to

cvx:    # Convex
        $(MAKE) -j 4 mtest OS=$@ EXTRADRIVERS="$(EXTRADRIVERS)" \
                STDPROTO=bezerkproto \
                CFLAGS="-O -ext -string read_write -Dconst= $(EXTRACFLAGS)"

The pine-team allready has a patch that fixes the problem without read_write
strings and it will be in the next pine version.

   Hello.

   I am trying to install pcpine_w.tar.Z for use with a PPP hookup.

   Here is what I have so far:

   INBOX		{ ... ??? ... }INBOX
   User-id      	pp000547
   Personal Name	Yours Truly
   Host/Domain		interramp.com
   SMTP server		smpt.interramp.com
   NNTP server		nntp.interramp.com

   Can anyone tell me what I should put for { ... }INBOX?

   I have tried various things:

   {interramp.com}INBOX
   {smtp.interramp.com}INBOX
   {pp000547.interramp.com}INBOX

but in each case I get an error message to the effect that no such INBOX
exists.

  Thank you.

  Bill

   Does this mean that I cannot use Pine if my remote PPP host is not
running an imap server?

I'd hope that this would be settable on both site- and user- basis.

There are those of us that intentionally choose to override reply-to lines
at times, particularly on mailing lists that automatically tack a reply-to:
for the list on each post, regardless of content.

Hello All.

How do I create a mailing list that runs by itself. What I mean
is if someone on the list send a message, how do I tell pine to
automatically distribute it to the rest on the list. I know how to
do it manually, but is it possible to do it automatically?
BTW I am using Pine 3.89.

Thanks.

Bill,
Yes, that's true.

Ask the Interramp folks if they'd be willing to install "imapd" on their 
host(s).  ("It's just like POP only better." :)  We'd be happy to assist 
them if they have difficulty.  Source and binaries for imapd are in the 
/pine directory on ftp.cac.washington.edu.

Pine 3.90 ran for almost all of our users without a glitch, right out of
the box.

One user (of course the least technically-literate) still had hang-up
problems, but she's got a strange PC configuration too.  I built a pine
binary using -ltermcap rather than -lcurses on AIX 3.2.2, and it ran
just as well as the one using -lcurses, and didn't lock up for this
user either.

Whatever was done in pine, thanks guys!  I don't find myself killing
off idle pine sessions any more.

  I took a closer look at the error message I get; it says

  Can't connect to interramp.com,143: <message>

where <message> varies ("Connection refused", "Timed out", "Unknown error").

  I am getting the idea that the "143" in the error message has something 
to do with the `impd' (daemon?).

  If so, does the error consist on the fact that I am not running `impd' 
or that smtp.interramp.com is not running `impd' or both?

  Thank you.

   Bill

Subject: Pine on Interactive 3.2
Date: 13 Sep 1994 13:18:54 GMT
Message-Id: <3548ru$165@ankh.iia.org>

I have just spent the last two days getting PINE running on an 
Interactive 3.2 box.  To save others from encountering trouble - 
hopefully :) - I thought I'd drop a few hints.

First, the makefiles need to be modified to eliminate the "ln -s" 
references.  Interactive doesn't offer a "-s" option in their base 
release.  Instead, I used striaght "ln" for file links and "link" for 
directory links.  Warning: if you use "link", the statements with "rm 
-rf" in them tend to destroy the original directories and files - namely 
the c-client file.

There also is a conflict with the declaration of "memmove" in the pine 
header files.  The conflict arises with pine declaring memmove to be a 
(void *) type, and in <strings.h>, ISC declares memmove also - a fatal 
compile error.  The easiest solution (to me) was simply comment out the 
memmove declaration in <strings.h> - remember to uncomment when your done.

As you run the compile, a lot of warnings pop up about illegal pointer 
operands, these can safetly be ignored.  Last, but not least, make sure 
you have "sendmail" working on your system.  The default ISC UNIX mail 
does not operate with pine and generally screws things up.

Thought you might want to know...

How about a way to goto the next selected message without having
to Zoom in on them first? 

Either:

(1) Change TAB from NextNew to NextSel when a selection is active.

(2) Add a Control-something Next Selected to Jump choices 

(3) or Add it to Whereis choices. 

( It's anoying to have to zoom and unzoom to read new mail, while
  you're trying to read a selected thread. )

Hi,

I am setting up PC-Pine and would like to use some common files so that 
whether I read my mail via PC-Pine (on any number of PCs) or Pine I get 
some common defaults.

I believe the PINERC(.pinerc) files are pretty identical so they could be 
copied from the PC to the UNIX box and vice versa.  I was able to get the 
folders to be the same by setting 
	folder-collections = {livingstone}~/mail/[]

After this worked, I thought it would be nice to have only one signature 
file and one address book.  So, since the above worked, I set the following:
	address-book   = {livingstone}~/.signature
	signature-file = {livingstone}~/.addressbook

Livingstone is a UNIX box which is running imapd and pine is available.  
When I tried to access the addressbook, I get the message
	[ Permission Denied - No Read Access to File ]

That inspired the obvious, here is the answer
	livingstone 146: ls -l .addressbook
	-rw-rw-r--  1 kenny          42 Sep 13 13:16 .addressbook

Then when I try to compose a letter, my signature did not appear.  I 
didn't recieve any error messages either.

Is this suppose to work?  If so, could I please get some help.

Thanks,

This doesn't quite fit my requirement. E-mail, with it's ability to send a
message to many receipients, a number of which may replay, is much like an
office memo sent to a team of colleges working on a project. Such a memo
would be stored in a project file. Thus, when I communicate with a team of
people I save the message (e-mail) in a folder of an appropriate name (eg:
Project 1). Any reply/incomming  mail is also saved to this folder. The
facility I'm looking for is quite simple. I visit one one my folders to
view project information and may wish to send mail about the project or
reply to some mail received from another team member. I would like this
mail to be FCC'd to this folder (which will be my current folder) so as to
keep all converstions about the project in the one place.

At the moment I have to change to the "sent-mail" folder and save the
message back to the poject folder I was in when I sent it.

  You can grab the executables of Pine from here: nwcl.nwcl.net in

Yup, the problem is probably that smtp.interramp.com is not running imapd...

And I also note that there's no way to select by a negative
criteria ( e.g. "NOT To: sdm7g" ) except for selecting by
flags: Answered/New/Important ( but not Selected ). 

That would be a useful feature. ( Not absolutely essential, 
as you can often "manually" 'Unselect Current' to exclude
a few messages. ) I'm not sure where exactly it would fit 
into the interface.

Okay, before I am flamed hopelessly, I have just re-read the Release 
Notes and found that the pine team already knows that you can't use 
remote address books and signature files.  So this is another thing 
already on their long wish list for an upcoming release.

The release notes also say the folders on the UNIX system will be 
read-only from PC-Pine.  However, I am finding out that this is not the 
case and that both Pine and PC-Pine have read-write access to all 
folders.  Have I just been lucky so far?  Or was this changed and it 
didn't get updated in the release notes?

Thanks,

Kenny,
If you use IMAP to access remote Bky-format folders on the Unix system
you're in Fat City --they will be R/W.  However, if you access those Unix
folders from the PC via NFS or SMB, or copy them to the PC, then they
will be Read Only.  The reason has to do with implementation 
limitations in the PC version of the Bky folder driver.

I built version 3.90 on SCO 3.2v4.2 with no difficulty. Just used "build sco".
I have since modified Pico to use terminfo for function keys etc.

  Thank you for this information, David.

  Ok, that's that.

  I have written a letter to Interramp explaining this problem and asking 
if they plan to support IMAPD any time soon.

Is it my imagination or is there no way to catchup the messages when 
reading newsgroups with pine 3.9....

this means everytime I enter it, if I haven't deleted it, a message will 
show up... if thats so, it poses a serious problem to using pine for 
newsgroups.  A simple catchup would just D everygroup...

Maybe I'm missing something...

I've installed pine 3.89 on a Sparc-10 running 4.1.3 and C2 security.  
Normally, when I'm compose mail to a local user, I type their login and 
pine does a lookup on their real name and inserts that in the To: field 
and then puts their login in brackets ("< >").  Anyway, this isn't 
working ...

Any ideas anyone?

As many of you know, there have been some problems with address books in
Pine 3.90.  Blank lines in an address book or entries with empty nicknames
cause the problems.  The symptom is usually that your address book appears
to contain only a small subset of the entries.  If you then try to add an
entry or edit an entry, data will probably be destroyed.  The patch files
included as attachments in this message fix those problems.  These are the
patches that will be in version 3.91 when it comes out.  These are source
patches.  Binary patches are not available at this time.

Do you need this fix?  It's probably reasonable for most people to wait
for the 3.91 release.  It is also probably wise to make a backup copy of
your address books, in any case.  (You would have to do that outside of 
Pine.)

When will 3.91 be available?  This is hard to predict.  We're trying to
correct as many of the reported bugs as possible before releasing 3.91. 
We will also try to correct the bugs that will be reported in the next
couple of weeks, and we don't know how many of those there will be.  If the
problems that we learn about in the next couple of weeks aren't too bad, we
expect to release 3.91 around the end of the month. 

If you are going to install these fixes and you have the patch program 
available on your system, the easiest way to put the patches in is with 
the Pine pipe command.  Suppose your pine source tree is rooted at 
/usr/src/local/pine3.90.  Go into the attachment viewer index by typing 
"V", then feed each of attachments 2 through 5 to the command

    patch -d /usr/src/local/pine3.90/pine

(Notice the extra /pine on the end of that, because these files are all in
the pine subdirectory.) That should replace the four files in the pine
subdirectory with new versions.  You then cd to the pine3.90 directory and
run the build script.

Subject: Found bug in PC-Pine 3.90 (init_subject_cache)
Date: 13 Sep 1994 20:31:54 GMT
Message-Id: <35527q$9l8@lastactionhero.rs.itd.umich.edu>

 Last week I reported two bugs with PC-Pine 3.90.   I found and fixed one of
 them today.

 When PC-Pine is instructed to sort a folder by anything other than arrival
 order, the machine appears to lock up and the disk is filled with a
 large collection of lost file chains.

 Below is the culprit function (from mailindx.c).  


/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
    initialize the subject cache
  ----*/
void
init_subject_cache(n)
    long n;
{
    subcache = (struct subcache *) fs_get(sizeof(struct subcache));
    memset((void *)subcache, 0, sizeof(struct subcache));
    subcache->size = n;
#if	defined(DOS) && !defined(_WINDOWS)
    subcache->buf = fs_get(SUB_CACHE_LEN+1);
    subcache->ent = tmpfile();
    { long i;
      for(i = 0L; i <= n; n++)
	fwrite(subcache->buf, (size_t)SUB_CACHE_LEN, (size_t)1, subcache->ent);
#else
    subcache->ent  = (char **)fs_get((size_t)(n+1L) * sizeof(char *));
    memset((void *)subcache->ent, 0, (size_t)(n+1L) * sizeof(char *));
#endif
}


 The for statement should be changed to:

     for (i = 0L; i <= n; i++)

 As it stands in the original source, n will just run away from i and
 fill your disk with what is contained in subcache->buf.  If you
 rebooted your machine to break out of this, the writes in the for loop
 will turn into lost chains and you will need to run CHKDSK /F to
 recover your disk space.

 After making this change and rebuilding PC-Pine, I found another problem
 with folder sorting that I haven't looked into yet.  Sorting by Subject and
 Ordered Subject will only work if it is set in PINERC and then only when the
 folder is initially opened.  Selecting $ and then either of those options on
 an open folder will list mail in the order it was in when the folder was
 opened. The other sorts work properly.

 I have not yet been able to track down the other bug I reported last week.
 After running PC-Pine 3.90 any Novell mapped drives when accessed
 will lock up or reboot the machine. PC-Pine 3.89 did not have this problem.
 If anyone has solved this I would love to here the solution, since this
 prevents us from deploying PC-Pine 3.90 in our computing sites. 


 Now, for a question/flame.

 Was PC-Pine even tested before it was released?  The sorting problem was 
 glaring enough that it should have been found with minimal testing.  Yet
 I did not seen any mention of it in the documentation, readme files or in
 the mailing list/newsgroup.

I just got pine 3.9 and I'm playing around with it - I created some 
incoming boxes and gave them nicknames, etc.  They have NO messages in 
them.  I can't erase them!  One says just this:
Nickname of folder AMOS_LIST
I try to erase it and it says can't erase ::

I don't think the instructions are very clear on incoming folders.  I 
have about 7 folders where filter sends my incoming mail.  If I want tab 
to work, I somehow have to make these folders move up to the Incoming 
section.  How do I do that?

All in all, I'm impressed, but for this problem.  I'm reading this 
newsgroup with pine right now and I love it.

In an earlier post, someone suggested that the problem with this was
that the default compile options set constant strings to non-rewrit-
able. He suggested recompiling with a flag of -fwritable_strings. I used
the equivalent -traditional switch when I recompiled pine and "eliminated"
the bug.

My question is: how reliable is this fix? We'd really like to upgrade to
3.9x but will wait for 3.91 if we must. Call me conservative but I don't
want to implement until I have confirmation from the development team
that this is a "legitimate" fix and not a temporary patch. Of course, if
it's going to be a month or more before 3.91 is released...well, that
puuts things in a different light.

Well, that's certainly embarrassing.  It seems our very own pine-announce 
mailing list handler strips the essential MIME headers off before sending 
the message out, so my last message to pine-announce will appear 
garbled.  I'll try to get that fixed tomorrow and then send the patch again.

You're missing something (this was asked and answered about three days 
ago too)...

Pine gives you a pair of wonderful commands called Select (the ";" 
command) and Apply (the "A" command).

Select can be used to select messages/articles by many criteria (eg, 
Current, All, Subject string, From sender, To recipient, etc).  It also 
lets you broaden a selection (in effect by doing an OR between criteria) 
or narrow it (an AND).

Having selected a range of messages a command can then be Applied to the 
selection.  (There is another related command, Zoom (Z), which restricts 
the Folder Index list to just the selected messages.)

So what you want to do is to first select all the messages (articles) in 
your newsgroup.  Do this by typing:
	; A

Now Apply (A) a Delete command (D) to the selection:
	A D

So the four keystrokes
	; A A D
will mark all the messages in the current newsgroup or mail folder as 
deleted.

OK, some people complain that this is three keystrokes longer than "K" 
(catch-up) or whatever.  However it offers great flexibility in selecting 
messages to be operated on, and is consistent with Pine's behaviour in 
mailboxes too.

You may also like to consider applying other commands such as Save (S) or 
Print (Y).

Hi all,

Has anyone got Pine 3.90 ported to Interactive (ISC) UNIX 3.2?  I successfully 
got PICO to build, but since ISC 3.2 does not support symbolic links, the 
build (makes) for PINE continue to die when attempts are made to "ln -s".  
Sorry, I do not have alot of free time to work around this and was hoping 
someone had an ISC UNIX "build" that was modified that did NOT use "ln -s".

TIA,
Scott <sgallowa@access.digex.net>

Hi,

Is there an easy way to stop pine generating it's own From: headers?

I've got sendmail set up sweet here (USERDB rewrites) but as pine
generates it's own From: header - sendmail just leaves it alone :-(

 Yes, even though I haven't tried the Windows version of Pine yet, I
 do not doubt that it works.  By examining the source code I listed
 in my first post, you see that the Windows version uses the same code
 as the various UNIX versions.  Only for DOS does it do things differently,
 and hence you are going to find some different bugs.

Sunil,

You aren't very specific here, so I will answer this 2 ways.  To do this 
interactively, you can use 'F' while reading the message you want to 
forward.  

However, I suspect you would like to do this automagically.  This can be 
done by using a filtering program like 'filter' which is included in the 
ELM distribution I believe and 'procmail' (I don't know where you get 
this, but according to messages here, it is the superior program).  I 
have included a message I have kept around because it has some examples 
of how to use 'filter'.

Hope this helps,

Here's what's in my ~/.elm/filter-rules file:  (~ is shorthand for $HOME)

	if (to contains "RXYZ@") then forward "RXYZ@UMAB.BITNET"
	if (to contains "ABC") then forward "ABC@UFRJ.BITNET"
	if (to contains "DEF") then save "~/mail/DEF-Inbox"
	if (to contains "GHI") then save "~/mail/GHI-Inbox"
	if (to contains "JKL") then save "~/JKL-Inbox"
	if (to contains "@") then save "~/Inbox"

Explanation:
	Lines 1 and 2... couldn't get off the mailing lists, and the 
listowners wouldn't respond to my messages, so now I'm bouncing anything 
from those lists back to the list.
	Lines 3, 4, and 5... all are high-volume mailing lists, so I put 
those into their own "Inboxes."  By the way, I *do* *not* add these into 
the .pinerc file, since they are not relevant to my Real Job (tm), and I 
don't want to be notified when there's new mail in them (there's *always* 
new mail in them... they're high volume).
	Line 6 is because on our system, something is screwed up, and all
mail that didn't fit into rules 1-5 went into an ~/EMERGENCY_MBOX file, and
I didn't like that. 


>2.Now what do I do next? Do I go into .pinerc and write:
>
>	incoming-folders=Chile-heads filter/$HOME/mail/Chile-heads (?)

Prbably.  I don't... see above (rules 3-5).


>Do I have to make any mention of my default INBOX, where I still want 
>"regular" messages to be placed?

Maybe.  I do... see above (rule 6).


>3.I have seen references to a .forward file somewhere, but I'm have no idea 
>what that file should contain, and where to put it?

You put it in your home directory:  ~/.forward.  Here's what's in mine:

	"|/usr/local/bin/filter -o ~/.elm/filter-errors"


Also note that this format (I can't seem to get any others to work 
properly) will create (in your .elm directory) files called:  
filter-errors, filterlog, and filtersum.  Filterlog and filtersum keep on 
growing and growing and growing and growing, so that eventually you need 
to delete them.  Filterlog is *especially* bad.  I keep mine until it's 
about 0.5 meg, then rm it, *AND THEN I CREATE A NEW ONE*.  An empty file 
(one line, or a 0), just so that filter can have a file... it's pretty 
finnicky.  If there isn't a file for it, it starts putting all your mail 
back in that !@!$#!@ EMERGENCY_MBOX file again.

Trust me, I've been doing it for a while, and it's still pretty cryptic! 
I've had lots of great help from the help desk and system operators here
at the University.  (Keep up the good work, people!)

Hope this helped a little.

Not an answer to your question, but:-
I tried sorting in a pre-release of Windows Pine, which seemed to 
complete OK, but slowly. Other than that I have not tried sorting in 
PC-PINE as I know from bitter experience (Pine 3.85) that it is/was so slow 
as to be catastrophic, and no one has suggested that there has been any 
magic wand waved. Now if you or someone else tells me that it now (or 
at least, after the bug fix) works at a reasonable speed I will try again 
(Presumably in 3.91).

The documentation in our current version of pine (3.87) is pretty clear: 
printing within pine is not supported in a Novell Netware environment. 

Question: Will this be changing in the near-term?  Thank,

Hi,

I had a user report that he attempted to enter his passwd 3 times 
unsuccessfully (due to the CAP-LOCK key) and PC-PINE sort of locked up.

I know, 'sort of locked up'?  By this I mean, you can no longer attempt to
log in(waited about 10 minutes) but selecting Options, About or Help from
the menu works.  Also, I can't find a way to close PC-Pine.

Is this the expected behavior?

As many of you know, there have been some problems with address books in
Pine 3.90.  Blank lines in an address book or entries with empty nicknames
cause the problems.  The symptom is usually that your address book appears
to contain only a small subset of the entries.  If you then try to add an
entry or edit an entry, data will probably be destroyed.  The patch files
included as attachments in this message fix those problems.  These are the
patches that will be in version 3.91 when it comes out.  These are source
patches.  Binary patches are not available at this time.

Do you need this fix?  It's probably reasonable for most people to wait
for the 3.91 release.  It is also probably wise to make a backup copy of
your address books, in any case.  (You would have to do that outside of 
Pine.)

When will 3.91 be available?  This is hard to predict.  We're trying to
correct as many of the reported bugs as possible before releasing 3.91. 
We will also try to correct the bugs that will be reported in the next
couple of weeks, and we don't know how many of those there will be.  If the
problems that we learn about in the next couple of weeks aren't too bad, we
expect to release 3.91 around the end of the month. 

If you are going to install these fixes and you have the patch program 
available on your system, the easiest way to put the patches in is with 
the Pine pipe command.  Suppose your pine source tree is rooted at 
/usr/src/local/pine3.90.  Go into the attachment viewer index by typing 
"V", then feed each of attachments 2 through 5 to the command

    patch -d /usr/src/local/pine3.90/pine

(Notice the extra /pine on the end of that, because these files are all in
the pine subdirectory.) That should replace the four files in the pine
subdirectory with new versions.  You then cd to the pine3.90 directory and
run the build script.

Subject: pine 3.90 bug under Solaris 2.3?
Date: 14 Sep 1994 10:27:36 -0700
Message-Id: <357bq8$md9@greve.ucs.ubc.ca>


Every once in a while since installing pine 3.90 on our solaris 2.3 system
I've been catching pine processes that have gone into a tight loop. The problem
appears to be caused by the user having logoff (probably forcefully) and pine
not picking up on the fact that he should now go away.

gdb doesn't allow me to debug another process so I can't give you much more
information but I did get some truss output from two tasks that shows the
problem:

write(1, "1B [ 5 ; 1 4 H", 7)                   Err#5 EIO
poll(0xEFFFDA88, 1, 150000)                     = 1
read(0, 0xEFFFDA0F, 1)                          = 0
time()                                          = 779559428
write(1, "1B [ 5 ; 1 4 H", 7)                   Err#5 EIO
poll(0xEFFFDA88, 1, 150000)                     = 1
read(0, 0xEFFFDA0F, 1)                          = 0
time()                                          = 779559428
...

and

poll(0xEFFFDC48, 1, 150000)                     = 1
read(0, 0xEFFFDBCF, 1)                          = 0
time()                                          = 779559405

time()                                          = 779559405
...

Any ideas? Thanks

   You do not do that with Pine, Pine is an user agent (what YOU use
   to send mail). There are two ways to do that :

   1) simple, for small lists you mantain.
      If you are root, define your list as an alias in /etc/aliases.
      If you are not root, ask you sys adm to define in /etc/aliases
      an alias to an :include: file which you will then mantain.

      This is very simple, we use it a lot down here

   2) more sophisticated, for longer lists, which can also be
      self mantained (i.e. people can subscribe automatically to
      the list)

      get software to do it, e.g. listserv (was free now commercial ?)
      or listproc, or .... other may know better than I do

I'm getting duplicates of all of these messages.  I should only be
subscribed to pine-announce.  I was subscribed to pine-info but
unsubscribed when the news group was created.  I tried to figure out what
was going on through MajorDomo (a while ago) but it didn't even show me as
being on pine-announce.  Can someone help?

I am running on an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.5, and could not reproduce
the results you reported.  I overwrote the file as I should have.

I have no problem printing to a printer on a Novell server, but my setup
may be significantly different from yours.  We have PINE running on a Unix
host, which we access using "Novell Virtual Terminal"  (NVT).  We print
using the Novell/DOS "capture" command (or the equivalent procedure in
Windows) on the client end and the "attached-to-ansi" printing feature in
PINE. This has worked consistently in PINE 3.89 and 3.90.

I'm using WFWG 3.11 and lan workplace vsn 4.12 with the appropriate 
winsock.dll and it doens't work either. i can do everything except send mail.

I've also got win32s Vsn 1.15a installed as well. interestingly enough, 
I've been trying to run a package called ECSMail for windows and the 
latest beta release had problems after they rewrote their winsock code to 
get round a problem in PC-NFS. It brought up a problem with the Lan 
workplace winsocket code although I don;t know exactly what the problem was.

One of the main reasons that I asked this question originally was that I 
had downloaded 3.90 for HP-UX from the HP archive and installed it on my 
system.  They make no mention of any change regarding this problem and 
the bug is not triggered (ie, I can specify a different file to move read 
messages to).

Newsgroups: comp.mail.pine,comp.mail.elm
Subject: Re: HELP! Filtering incoming mail
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Organization: Infinite Ink, Seattle, Washington, USA


Here's yet another list of instructions for setting up filter.


USING ELM'S FILTER PROGRAM TO FILTER INCOMING MAIL
==================================================

1] Note the full path for filter by typing:

     which filter

   If your system doesn't have filter ask your sys admin to install it.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules


4] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules:

if (to contains "seasigi") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.seasigi"
if (to contains "lynx-dev") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.lynx-dev"
if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-talk"
if (to contains "www-announce") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/IN.www-announce"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Unix mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses /Mail
   (upper case M).
   
   Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...


5] To see what the filter rules will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


6] Create a ~/.forward file by typing:

     cd
     pico .forward


7] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:

     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

   Note you do want to include the quotes and you want to replace
   /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1) 
   and replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   
   Note that on some systems you will need to make your .forward world 
   readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
   mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
     cd
     chmod 644 .forward
     chmod +x .


8] Send yourself an email message to make sure that regular messages
   get through to your default inbox.


9] Regularly look at ~/.elm/filterlog and filter-errors to make sure things 
   are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
   log in by putting the following in your .login:

Message-Id: <357jse$rfh@mizar.usc.edu>

If I switch from a secondary incoming folder to my inbox _without_
expunging the deleted messages, I cannot tab back into that folder even if
I left messages marked as new.  Only when additional messages are
delivered to the folder can I use the tab method to get into it. 

Not a serious problem, but could this be fixed?

I don't how good they compair to others, but I have one for Pine and one 
for Pico that are available via our gopher at URL:

gopher://oboe.calpoly.edu:70/00/computing_at_CP/comp_OS/aix3/assist/how_tos
	/on-line/system/aix30301.ans

for the PICO guide and

gopher://oboe.calpoly.edu:70/00/computing_at_CP/comp_OS/aix3/assist/how_tos
	/on-line/system/aix80530.ans

for the PINE guide.  NOTE this doesn't include the latest versions of 
each, its modeled after 3.89 of PINE.

I didn't notice any imap or pop newsgroups so I'm posting here.

I just moved our mail server to a new machine because of problems with 
the original. Now I have a small problem that I have thus far been unable 
to resolve. The particulars:

imap, ipop2d, and ipop3d all worked fine on the original machine.

On the new machine, imap works fine via pine. Attempting to telnet to any 
of the three though results in a hanging process. ipop2d and ipop3d don't 
seem to be talking to Eudora either though they did fine on the original 
machine.

As far as I can tell, I have set up everything identically (made 
appropriate changes to /etc/services and /usr/etc/inetd.conf). Both 
machines are SGIs (the original running IRIX 4.0.5A, the new 4.0.5F). If 
there are any ideas as to why this is happening, I'd love to here them.

Yes.  I discovered how to fix the lookup, but now I have a new problem.  
I took out my 'user-domain' setting in pine.conf, but now it only prints the 
hostname and not the domain name.  I have tried fiddling with 
'use-only-domain-name' even though the comments indicate it's not a solution.

Any additional ideas?

Message-Id: <357p9g$1is6@lamar.ColoState.EDU>


I am having a problem with pine not sending the full address when I send a
message.

When user-domain is not specified, only the name of the machine (tlaloc) is
sent. If I specify user-domain as stat.colostate.edu, only the domain is sent,
and not the machine. This obviously causes problems with reply.


Messages sent by ordinary unix mail do have the correct 'from' address. 


I am using Pine 3.89. I am just using it myself on the machine I use---it has
not been set up for general access by the system administrator.


Please reply by email as I do not read this newsgroup.

When you include sender-text in Pine, appears the line:

"On Sept 7, John Doe wrote:"

Is there any user configurable way to change the default so that line says:

"On Sept 7, you wrote:"

99% of my correspondence is one-on-one, and the third person default is 
very impersonal in my mind.

I was wondering if there is a version of Pine (for HP-UX) that will act as a
POP client.  If not Pine, are there any POP clients for HP-UX.

Thanks

George

Subject: PC-Pine folder-collections setup problem
Date: 14 Sep 94 23:13:00 GMT
Message-Id: <idler.779584380@spot.Colorado.EDU>

I am having problems getting a remote folder collection off a
imap server using PC-Pine.  The folder-collections entry in my 
PINERC looks like this:

	folder-collections={spot.colorado.edu:143}mail/[]

However, when I go to my folder list, all of my folders have the first
two letters chopped off.  It also lists 'mail/' as a folder.  If I 
attempt to look at one of these folders, it says it cannot find the
folder.  Yet I can save to these folders.  A related problem is that 
I cannot save fcc's to a folder on my imap server.  The first time it 
works.  After that it asks if I want to create a sentmail folder, 
and when I type 'Y', it says that the folder already exists.  
Consequently, it doesn't send the message.

If anyone has any suggestions, please post or mail me.  Thanks.

I'm running procmail 3.06 and pine 3.90 on an rs/6000 using aix3.2.5. I'm 
filter mail ok but I'm getting lots of lock file errors. I've read all 
the examples and docs and the FAQs but I can't get the errors to go away.

In my .procmailrc file I use /usr/spool/mail/$xxxx as the DEFAULT so that 
inbox in Pine will get the mail. The alternative is $HOME/mbox which 
might get rid of the locking errors but Pine can't find mbox. Or mabe I 
don't have the lockfile set up but I though procmail just did that for 
you.   Can anyone help?

VTY,

Message-Id: <mdavis.779595966@crash.cts.com>

Something changed between 3.87 and 3.90 in the default printer
selection (attached-to-ansi).  Users used to be able to print using
the 3.87 defaults through their terminal programs.  Now we're
receiving a lot of reports about it not working.  Example:

------------------------------
Date: Wed, 14 Sep 1994 15:05:11 -700 (PDT)
To: CTSNET Support <support@cts.com>
Subject: Pine Printing

I use procomm for windows 2.0 to sign into cts.  Since the newest
version of pine was added I have been unable to print messages by
pressing Y to print.  My printer setup in Pine is "Attached to Ansi".
Do you have any suggestions.
------------------------------

I've run the old 3.87 binary to compare it with the default printer
selection, and it had "attached-to-ansi" enabled, too.  Any
suggestions on getting 3.90 to work like 3.87 did?  Please Cc your
replies to my mailbox if possible.

Thank you.

  I have written a letter to Interramp explaining this problem and asking 
if they plan to support IMAPD any time soon.

Is it possible for a normal user to run the imap daemon?  I have built
the pine3.90 binaries on unix and am trying to use the Winsock version
on my PC.  I can't seem to run imapd in background because it wants
input.  When running in foreground, I still can't connect to port 143.

As a non-root user, I seem to remember that I can't create 3 figure ports
so is it possible to change the port that imapd creates?  Is there
another way of getting imapd to work?

Currently, when you have postponed mail pending and you hit compose new
message you get the `Continue postponed message Y/N' question.  I think it
would be more intuitive if pine went into the list of postponed messages
directly and from that screen there was the option to create a new
message. 

I have found that in usage I hit compose and then have to check that I 
haven't started to answer the message in question and then exit the 
selector and hit compose again.

I have looked at the code and I don't think it is very hard to implement 
(I may yet have a crack) but I suspect then someone more into the code 
could make the needed changes in a couple of seconds.

What do you think?

Andy.

I found the problem after being away from it for the night. Seems I 
didn't quite have everything identical after all as one might expect by 
the non-identical behavior. I had imap, pop, and pop3 listed as wait 
instead of nowait in /usr/etc/inetd.conf. Of course, that leaves the 
question of why pine was able to use imap successfully, but at this 
point, I suppose, it is academic.

You know, of course, that the modem also has to have X-on/X-off 
flow control turned off.  The command for a Hayes compatable
modem is AT&K0.

You didn't tell what system the IMAP-server is on but it must be a
Solaris 2.3 system (and according to DNS a big one ;-). 

Marc Crispin once wrote the following about IMAPD and Solaris. His
hints should solve your problem.

I have determined the cause of the problem reading MH folders via imapd 
on Solaris.

The imapd binary for Solaris which we distributed was bad.  This is caused
by a known problem in which a SVR4 program on Solaris can be lunk with the
BSD compatibility libraries without any error being reported.  The
structures returned by readdir() on BSD and Solaris are very similar; the
filenames are offset by two bytes.

It's an environmental problem, based upon your path and evidentally the 
phase of the moon and the blood type of the guy doing the build.  Haven't 
figured it out yet, although we've chased a lot of false clues.

Anyone who builds Pine on Solaris from sources should be aware of this
problem.  You can see whether or not the build was correct by checking the
results of expanding a folder collection; if the first two characters are
missing, the bug has bit.  Be sure to check both local and IMAP access;
this time Pine was fine and imapd was broken. 

Corrected imapd-bin.solaris and imapd-bin.solaris.Z files are now on
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  All the pre-built binaries should run correctly. 

We apologize for the difficulty.

Besides the obvious cut and paste, there is a solution if you have programs

With procmail/formail, you can split the digest into individual mails before you
actually read them.

Hello,

I'd like to setup a mailing-list an easy way and without any hasstle.  
What I want is to create one list only and be able to add/delete members.
Also somehow I can make it free from being mail-bombed from non-members.
And I can make the headers right when any memeber recieves the list, they
can reply to the mailing-list. Like errors, From, To, etc...

Is there a way to do with.  I am on SYSV v4.2 1   

I have looked though several list server packages likes majordomo, listproc,
etc.  It seems like you need to have root access for some of the functions
and setup.

Is there a way to make this list happen? I appreciate any help and suggestions.

Thank you.

Actually I think that Pine 3.90 will help to alleviate this confusion.
Rather than needing to know the difference between "reply" and
"followup" the user will just type r for "reply" and then be
prompted with:

Post follow-up message to news group(s)?

If the user answers y the response is prepared with a filled in
Newsgroups header and if the answer is n the response is prepared
with a filled in To header.  In both cases the user can edit the 
headers so that the reply is both posted and mailed.


>"If the only tool you have is a hammer, all of your problems start

But having one tool for mail and news makes a lot of sense, especially 
for new users.  Why should they need to learn two user interfaces and
two sets commands for reading essentially the same things - folders of
messages.  Mail is just private folders and news is public folders.
I know there are differences in the way you read public vs. private
folders, e.g. you want auto "deleting" to happen a lot in your
public folders, but I'm sure these can be solved and Pine is the
first tool that's well on its way to solving this.

I have taught many people how to use many newsreaders and yesterday
I spent about an hour teaching my dad how to use Pine to read news.
He picked it up immediately because of his experience using Pine for
mail and he even has become enthusiastic about newsgroups because he
stumbled upon the Social Security Number FAQ which contained information 
he needed for his work.  He forgot to ask me for all my NN handouts
which he had eagerly reminded me to bring to our meeting (we had had
a few NN training sessions before).

Did you type mem /c to see which programs were loaded and how much memory 
they took up?  After that type rem in front of the memory hogs in you 
config.sys and autoexec.bat.  If you have msdos 6.2 run scandisk, defrag, 
and then memmaker to optimize the disk and tsr's used in ram.

Apologies to Terry Gray, who will get this twice (switching between news
readers + long day :)

The following is my problem (maybe unrelated to the included problem),
anyone think of something I'm doing wrong?

Just to add some (hopefully useful) info about this user-domain problem.
This is using the Sun pre-compiled binary.  In my system there is a general
mail server machine (as an example, mail.company.com).  Mail sent within
company should always be sent to this address, so I have set
user-domain=mail.company.com.  This works fine for mail Composed, it will
automatically add the domain name eg.  smith@mail.company.com.  However, if
mail is sent from someone at another server (ie. anyone not using pine but
with a company.com extension) and the message is Replied to, it persists in
using the other server name, which bounces the mail.  As an example, I
receive mail from joe@server.company.com and hit "r" to reply.  In the To:
field it puts joe@server.company.com when what I need is
joe@mail.company.com.  This is regardless of the value of
use-only-domain-name.

Note that this worked perfectly in Pine 3.87!

Pine 3.90 is otherwise wonderful, but we may have to stay with 3.87 until
this is fixed (retyping the names works, but is impractical to remember to
do every time - we have lots of mail).  If you need further info, feel free
to mail me (dex@uclink.berkeley.edu or dexter@geoworks.com).  Thanks!

However, 6.2 memmaker can do strange stuff if you're connected into a
Novell network.  It worked once for me, but never again.  It gave some
good hints about optimizing memory by hand, though.  But to be sure, save
clean copies of your config.sys and autoexec.bat in case it won't put you
back where you started from.  Good luck,

Ok, after further investigation, I somewhat figured out what the problem
is.  Incoming messages without any @blah.company.com following the name
(like internal mail from non-pine users which are just "smith" without
other info) causes pine 3.90 to append @[current hostname].company.com to
the From: line, and consequently the reply To: line.  The older 3.87 version
of pine appended @userdomain.company.com to the address (this was the 
.pinerc set userdomain, without a userdomain set it appends just 
company.com). 

I'll check with my sysadmin to see if anything can be done, but is there
anything that can be done with setting something different in the .pinerc 
or something?  Do you know why this would have changed?

Thank you very much for your help, in particular your rapid response.

Hmm, I am able to use the same smtp gateway with other packages.  I have 
also tried other smtp servers with no success.

My mistake.  It simply does not send the mail and does not return a 
prompt.  Further, I'm prevented from switching to another task until I 
use <ctrl><alt><del> to cancel out of PC-Pine.

Hi!  Is that possible to add one more information, the current position
of cursor, in control-c?  So far we have line x of y, character xx of yy. 
If we can know the current position of the cursor, that will be great for
fortran programmer who uses pico to write their program.  BTW, what is 
the character xx of yy is important?

Thanks!!

Hi, one of my users asked me this question, and I don't know the 
answer...do any of you?
Reid Fishler
Long Island Information, Inc.
redhead@liii.com


Is there a way to increase the number of lines per screen by 2 on Pine 
3.90?  What is happening is that on each subsequent screen of a message, 
the top two lines are identical to the bottom two of the prior screen.  
Consequently, reading rapidly I'm constantly rereading the same lines.  
No, I can't just begin reading on the third line.  First of all it's not 
something you can get used to doing, and if there's an empty line, it's 
no longer the top two lines and it ends up very confusing. I would really

Subject: 0.00 Reading Digests

This article is in digest format so you may be able to use your newsreader 
or mailer to easily skip to a subject you're interested in.  

* In nn you can type G% to have each subject presented on a submenu.  

* In trn (and its relatives like rn) you can type ^g (CTRL key and g key 
  pressed simultaneously) to skip to the next line that begins with "Subject: "

* In emacs GNUS, C-c C-n will skip to the next digest article (C-C C-p will
  go back to the previous digest article).

Please mail me similar commands for other newsreaders and mailers so that I 
can include them here.

Subject: 1.00 Automatic Signature - General Instructions

Q: How can I have a signature automatically appended to my news articles 
   and mail messages?

A: The answer depends on your newsreader and mailer but the following 
   procedure works for many Unix newsreaders and mailers.


Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Go to your home directory.

pico .signature         Use the pico editor to create a .signature file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your signature>        Note that most systems require your sig to be <= 4 
                        lines.  And it's good netiquette to make it as
                        short as possible.

chmod 644 .signature    Make .signature readable by all.

ls -l .signature        Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e., 
                        drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).

ls -la                  Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.

Next if you use Pine, Elm, Mail, Emacs Mail Mode, MH, TIN, NN, or GNUS read
the additional instructions described below.  After you've set everything up 
use your mailer to mail a test message to yourself, and your newsreader and/or 
news poster (such as nnpost or Pnews) to post an article to a test newsgroup 
(use a local newsgroup and local distribution to save bandwidth).  Note that 
many newsreaders and mailers add a line that contains ``-- '' to the top of 
your sig.  This is used by programs that automatically deal with mail or news 
to identify the start of the signature.

If you have problems with your sig see section 1.99 on Troubleshooting below.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 1.11 Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for Pine 3.90

The default for Pine 3.90 is to use ~/.signature for your signature and 
to have signature-at-bottom set, so following the general instructions in 
1.00 should be enough.  If you want to change either of these you can use 
the setup menu by doing the following.

1. From the Main Menu type s for Setup
2. Type c for Configuration
3. To change the name of your signature file: 
   a) Arrow down to the signature-file line
   b) Type c for Change Value
   c) Type the path and name of the file you want to use for your
      signature.  Note that ~ means your $HOME directory.
4. To change the value of the signature-at-bottom feature:
   a) Space bar and arrow down to the signature-at-bottom variable
   b) Type x to set/unset this variable.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 1.12 Automatic Signature-Specific Instructions for Pine 3.89 and Below

In addition to the general signature instructions in 1.00 above, users of
Pine 3.89 usually want to edit their ~/.pinerc file so that it contains 
the following:

feature-list=signature-at-bottom

If you want more than one feature in your feature-list then they should be 
comma separated like this:

feature-list=old-growth,
	signature-at-bottom

Note that Pine's default is to use ~/.signature for your signature so you
only need to edit the following line if you are using a different file.

signature-file=

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 1.13 Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for Elm

In addition to the general signature instructions in 1.00 above, users of Elm 
should edit their ~/.elm/elmrc file so that it contains the following:

signature = ~/.signature
sigdashes = ON

Remember to delete any # characters before any any variables you want
to set.  The defaults are indicated in comment lines starting with ###.

Note that if you want to have a different signature for local mail
(i.e., addresses that don't contain a ! or @) then you can use the 
localsignature and remotesignature variables instead of the signature 
variable (which specifies one sig for all mail).

Subject: 1.14 Semi-Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for Mail

=o= Regular Unix "Mail" and "mail" don't have an automatic
signature mechanism.  Many people who normally use a more deluxe
mail utility occasionally find themselves resorting to using one
of these, in which case all you need to know is this command:

	~r $HOME/.signature

This simply tells Mail to include the text of the your signature
file.

=o= If you use Mail on a regular basis you may want to use the
semi-automatic signature feature.  When you're done typing your
message, you append a signature with this command:

	~a

=o= In order for this to work, though, you need to set the
"sign" mail variable.  There are two ways to implement this
variable.  The first is to set it in a $HOME/.mailrc file with
a command like this:

	set sign="Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

If your signature is more than one line long, you can use the
C language string syntax, as in these examples:

	set sign="Jym Dyer\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

			-or-

	set sign="Jym Dyer\
	\n<jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>"

=o= The disadvantage of doing this in your .mailrc file is
that you now have to maintain the text of your signature in
two places.  Another approach that avoids this problem is to set
"sign" as an environment variable in your shell startup script.
For a Bourne-compatible shell, this is done with this command:

	sign="`cat $HOME/.signature`" export sign

For a C-shell, do this:

	setenv sign "`cat $HOME/.signature`"

From: Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>
Subject: 1.15 Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for Emacs Mail Mode

=o= Emacs Mail Mode is usually invoked with the "mail" or
"mail-other-window" commands (bound, respectively, to the
"C-x m" and "C-x 4 m" keys by default).  It is also invoked
from various Emacs mail and news packages.

=o= Mail Mode provides a "mail-signature" command to append
the contents of your signature file to the end of your mail
message.  This command is bound to "C-c C-w" by default,
so to insert the signature before mailing, simply type
"C-c "C-w".

=o= If you'd prefer to have your signature automatically
appended to the end of your mail message, the "mail-signature"
command can be put into your "mail-setup-hook" variable in
your $HOME/.emacs file, as in this example:

    (setq mail-setup-hook
      (function
       (lambda ()
	 (mail-signature) )))

This will put the signature in your mail message buffer.

From: Jym Dyer <jym@remarque.berkeley.edu>
Subject: 1.16 Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for MH and Emacs MH-E

=o= MH doesn't have an automatic signature mechanism, but it
is so configurable that there are a number of different ways
to implement one.  Check the periodic "MH Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) with Answers" posting for details.

=o= CAVEAT:  If you use the environment variable SIGNATURE to
point to your signature file, MH will use it not as a signature,
but as your "fullname".  Even worse, if your version of MH was
built with the "UCI" option and you *don't* use the environment
variable SIGNATURE to point to another file, MH will use the
$HOME/.signature file for this purpose!  To see if your version
of MH has this behavior, enter this command:

  % send -help

And look for the string "[UCI]" in the output.

=o= There's an Emacs interface to MH, called MH-E.  It has its
own signature mechanism, which is invoked with the "mh-insert-
signature" command (bound to the "C-c C-s" keys by default).

=o= This will insert the file $HOME/.signature file by default.
If your signature file has another name (e.g., to avoid its
being used by an MH build with the "UCI" option), you can set
the "mh-signature-file-name" variable to refer to a different
file.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 1.21 Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for TIN

The default for TIN is to use your ~/.signature for mail and news (if 
~/.signature exists), so following the general instructions in 1.00 
should be enough.  You can set TIN up to use different signatures for 
different newsgroups. See the TIN man pages for more information.


Date: 16 Sep 1994 00:01:22 GMT
From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 1.22 Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for NN

In addition to the general signature instructions in 1.00 above, users of NN 
should edit their $HOME/.nn/init file so that it contains the following:

set query-signature off
set append-signature-mail on
set append-signature-post off  

Note that the reason that you need to ``set append-signature-post off'' is 
that the news transport (such as inews) automatically appends a .signature 
if it exists.  If you ``set append-signature-post on'' then both nn and 
inews append your sig and you'll send out two identical sigs every time.

From: Mike Northam <mbn@greyskul.intel.com>
Subject: 1.23 Automatic Signature - Specific Instructions for GNUS

In addition to the general signature instructions in 1.00 above, users of GNUS 
should verify that the value of the variable gnus-signature-file points to the
right place.  If you're in emacs, you can do so by evaluating the following 
expression:
gnus-signature-file
                   ^ put your cursor here and type C-x C-e

you should see "~/.signature" in the echo area.  If not, edit your
$HOME/.emacs file and add the following:
(setq gnus-signature-file "~/.signature"))
Then load your $HOME/.emacs file or merely restart emacs and the variable
should be set correctly.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 1.99 Troubleshooting Signature Problems

If the procedures above don't work, read the man pages for your newsreader, 
news poster, or mailer and search for the string "signature".  There may be a 
variable you need to set in order for the .signature to be appended.  

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
man CommandName |less   Open man pages for CommandName (elm, pine, nn, tin
                        trn, Pnews, etc.) and pipe through less.  If your 
                        system doesn't have less replace it with "more".

/signature              Search for first occurrence of "signature".

n                       Search for next occurrence of "signature".
                        Repeat the search until you find the appropriate
                        section of the manual.

u                       Page up half a screen. (This works in less but not in
                        more.)

[spacebar]              Page down a screen. (This works in both less and more.)

Subject: 2.00 Changing Your Default Finger Info: chfn

People around the world can find out more about you by "fingering" 
you.  This is done by typing:

   finger YourLoginName@Your.Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name

For example:
  
   finger nancym@halcyon.com


On many Unix systems you can change some of your default information, 
such as your full name, by typing the following at your Unix prompt:

   chfn

After you have used chfn check that your changes are in place by
fingering yourself.

If chfn is not available try "passwd -f".  If neither of these are 
available then you will need to contact your system administrator and
ask him/her to change your full name, etc.

For more information see the chfn, passwd, and finger man pages.

From: Nancy McGough <nancym@ii.com>
Subject: 2.01 Adding More to Your Finger Info: .plan & .project

The .project and .plan files, if they exist, are displayed when you 
are fingered.  Setting these up is essentially the same as setting 
up a .signature file (described above).

Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Go to your home directory.

pico .plan              Use the pico editor to create a .plan file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

chmod 644 .plan         Make .plan readable by all.

ls -l .plan             Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x.
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each.

ls -la                  Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.


If you want a .project file follow the same procedure.  Note that only the
first line of the .project is displayed (so you might as well only make
it one line!).  

To test your changes finger yourself by typing the following at the Unix prompt:

    finger YourEmailAddress

To ensure that people from other systems can finger you you should ask a friend
who's not on your system to finger you too.

Subject: 2.02 Finding Out Who Fingers You

This is complicated - and sometimes impossible - to setup.  For details see 
the news.answers article "Unix - Frequently Asked Questions (4/7) [Frequent 
posting]", item "4.9) How do I keep track of people who are fingering me?"  
This article is archived in a number of places including these two sites:

ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/unix-faq/faq/part4

<LI><a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/unix-faq/faq/part4/faq-doc-9.html">Unix - Frequently Asked Questions (4/7) [Frequent posting] - How do I keep track of people who are fingering me?</a>

One easy thing that you can do to see if anyone has fingered you is
type the following at your Unix prompt:

ls -lu ~/.plan

This tells you the last time someone accessed your .plan, but it doesn't
tell you who it was.  I have this in my .login because it's fun to see
when the last time someone was checking on me!

Memmaker itself shouldn't cause any problems with Novell (or other 
networks) as long as you're careful to tell EMM386.EXE to exclude the 
memory used by your network card.  The EMM386.EXE line in my CONFIG.SYS 
file looks approximately like this:

	DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS HIGHSCAN x=b000-b3ff 
	  i=b4ff-b7ff WIN=CD00-CFFF WIN=CA00-CCFF

The "x=b000-b3ff" parameter tells the memory manager not to try to load 
programs into high memory at that location.

Before running memmaker, add the x= parameter to the EMM386.EXE line in your 
CONFIG.SYS file.  If there is no EMM386.EXE line, add it:

	DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE X=xxxx-xxxx

where "xxxx-xxxx" is the memory used by the network card.  It will 
probably NOT be "b000-b3ff".  You may need to do some hunting to find out 
what it should be, unfortunately.

When you run memmaker, choose custom setup, and specify that memmaker 
should use all currently defined exclusions.  

If you use Windows, you should also add the following line to the 
[386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:

	EMMExclude=xxxx-xxxx

where "xxxx-xxxx" is the same as in the CONFIG.SYS file.

                         GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PINE

------------
Content-Description: What is Pine?

Subject: What is Pine?

   Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for
   reading, sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed
   specifically with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored
   to accommodate the needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses
   Internet message protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and
   runs on Unix and PCs. 
  
   The guiding principles for Pine's user-interface were:  careful
   limitation of features, one-character mnemonic commands,
   always-present command menus, immediate user feedback, and high
   tolerance for user mistakes.  It is intended that Pine can be learned
   by exploration rather than reading manuals.  It has the ability to
   perform full screen editing of messages, attachments (such as Word or
   Excel files), and other advanced message system features. 

   Pine uses IMAP for accessing message folders on remote computers and
   MIME for sending multimedia or other binary files as attachments to
   normal messages. 

   
------------ 
Content-Description: What is MIME?

Subject: What is MIME?

   MIME (RFC 1521) stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions". It
   is an Internet standard which allows transfer of binary files
   (word-processing documents, spreadsheets, images, sounds, etc) between
   any compliant mailers. You can get technical information about MIME
   from the RFC. Ongoing discussion on MIME takes place in the newsgroup
   comp.mail.mime. There is also a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list
   that is posted regularly to comp.mail.mime and comp.answers. 
   
------------
Content-Description: What is IMAP?

Subject: What is IMAP?

   IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". An IMAP client
   program on any platform at any location on the Internet can access
   email folders on an IMAP server. While the messages appear to be
   local, they reside on the server until the client explicitly moves or
   deletes them.  The IMAP protocol is a functional (but incompatible)
   superset of POP. A principal advantage of IMAP over POP is that it
   permits using more than one computer to access your mail.  Using
   multiple computers with POP typically results in your mail ending up
   scattered across all of those computers. Another key advantage is
   IMAP's ability to selectively access parts of messages, e.g. you
   don't have to wait for a 2MB audio attachment to be retrieved until
   you specifically ask for it.  This is a big win over low-speed (e.g.
   dialup) connections.  For a detailed comparison of IMAP and POP, see
   the paper "Comparing Two Approaches to Remote Mailbox Access: IMAP
   vs. POP."
  
   IMAP is what allows Pine (or any other IMAP client) to access email
   on a remote mail server, usually one that is shared (central or
   departmental).  There is an IETF working group currently defining the
   IMAP4 revision to the IMAP2 specification (RFC-1176).  A copy of the
   latest IMAP draft may be obtained from ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
   file imap/latest-imap-draft

------------ 
Content-Description: How can I get a copy of Pine?

Subject: How can I get a copy of Pine?

   Pine is available via anonymous ftp from the pine directory of
   ftp.cac.washington.edu. See the Installation Instructions for Pine for
   more information. 
   
------------
Content-Description: Is there a manual?

Subject: Is there a manual?

   The Pine program itself includes extensive online help.  Additional
   documentation may be found via anonymous FTP or via World-Wide-Web
   using the following URLs: 

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine

   The Pine program itself also includes extensive online help. Other
   forms of access are planned for the future.

Content-Description: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

Subject: What mailing lists and newsgroups are there dealing with Pine?

   The "comp.mail.pine" newsgroup is devoted to Pine.  It is
   bi-directionally gatewayed to the "pine-info" mailing list described
   below. 

   The following mailing lists deal with Pine and related topics: 
   
   Pine-Info@cac.washington.edu 
          Pine-Info is a mailing list for the email program Pine. The
          mailing list includes discussion of Pine features, bugs,

   We don't have a good way to count the number of sites running Pine,
   but at last count over 4,000 sites in 40 countries had downloaded the
   Pine 3.89 distribution from ftp.cac.washington.edu. There are also
   several major archive sites that mirror the distribution, so the
   actual numbers are probably much higher.

Subject: I have found a bug in Pine 3.05. Could you please fix it?

                                       

   When a bug is identified in an old release, there is a very strong
   possibility that the associated code has been re-written to the point
   that a fix will not apply to the current release.  Hence, if we can't
   reproduce the problem in the current version, our standard response
   will be to ask you to upgrade.

   This is a known limitation of the current release of pine. When you
   postpone a composition, Pine does not have any way to keep track of
   which message was being replied to (or that it was a reply at all).
   This limitation will be removed in a future release of Pine. 
   
------------
Content-Description: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

Subject: "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"

                                       

   The message "Folder Format Invalidated (consult an expert), aborted"
   means that Pine was reading your mail folder, and at the point in
   which it expected a start-of-message header line, it found something
   else.
   
   The ``format invalidated'' condition can happen in one of three ways: 
    1. bad data exists at the beginning of the folder. 
    2. data was appended to the folder after Pine initially read it, and
       the new data did not begin with a start-of-message-header. 
    3. the folder was modified without Pine being aware of it. 
       
   All three problems are generally caused by software external to Pine.
   
   Condition (1) can be determined by whether or not the problem repeats
   itself after restarting Pine. If restarting Pine does not make the
   problem go away, then you need to look at the actual file for the
   folder and see what is wrong with the very first line. In particular,
   make sure that there are no blank lines at the beginning of the file
   and that the first character of the folder file is a capital ``F'' ,
   the second an ``r'', the third an ``o'', etc.  In the case of an 
   INBOX, you may want to rename the folder so that new mail can be
   delivered while repairs on the corrupt folder are being done. 
   
   Condition (2) may be caused by a mail delivery process (e.g.
   /bin/mail) which writes some characters other than ``From '' at the
   beginning of the new data.
   
   Condition (3) is caused by another program manipulating the mail
   folder without following the normal folder locking protocols.  This
   is a general problem on UNIX. 
   
   Conditions (2) and (3) have also been known to occur when accessing
   folders via NFS, if the information returned by the stat() and read()
   system calls do not correspond with each other as a result of NFS
   attribute caching.
   
   Restarting Pine on that folder always clears conditions (2) and (3).
   If the problem is chronic, it may be worth an investigation to
   determine its cause. Usually, it is due to the misbehavior of some
   external software. The reason why Pine gives up with conditions (2)
   and (3) is that it does not want to risk damaging user data by
   guessing what is right. Pine never writes to the folder unless it is
   absolutely sure it knows what it is doing.
   
   There are some steps which can be taken to reduce the risk of these
   conditions coming up. Some of these steps may require the assistance
   of your system adminstrator (or whomever it was that built and
   installed Pine on your system): 
    1. Use IMAP instead of NFS to access remote folders. Problems with
       locking over NFS are perhaps the single most important cause of
       user difficulties.  Using IMAP eliminates this class of problem.
    2. Consider enabling the mbox driver in Pine. If the mbox driver is
       enabled, mail is transferred from the /usr/spool/mail mail into a
       file called mbox in your home directory, if mbox exists. The home
       directory mbox file is then your INBOX. This has the advantage
       that Pine and the mail delivery system are less often in
       contention for the INBOX, and never both trying to update it.
       Pine only empties the /usr/spool/mail file, it never tries
       updating it. 
    3. Be careful not to run other programs that modify your folders
       while you are running Pine. Such programs may change the folder
       out from under Pine, and lead Pine to conclude that there is a
       problem with its view of the file.

Content-Description: What is folder locking and how does it work?

Subject: What is folder locking and how does it work?

                                       

   Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
   occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the
   file at the same time.
   
   Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on
   UNIX, Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity.
   
   There are several reasons why locking needs to be done:
   
    1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no
       other process will modify the mail file while you are reading it.
       
    2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that
       no other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing
       it.
       
    3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no
       other process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file that you have read, but it is OK if another process appends
       new data to the mail file.
       
    4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail
       file, you want to make sure that no other process has the mail
       file open.
       
   There are several mechanisms of locking:
   
     * The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file,
       but with a suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for
       /usr/spool/mail/isma is named /usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This
       file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes
       can do this. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This
       accomplishes lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive
       lock. 
     * The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file
       name used depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes
       locks (3) and (4). This is an exclusive lock. 
       
   On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call
   it used instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of
   lock file as well, but this has not been directly verified.
   
   _NOTE: flock() on BSD systems does not work over NFS, so only the most
   basic .lock file locking -- locks (1) and (2) happen over NFS. On SVR4
   systems, fcntl() locking attempts to work over NFS, but there are
   known problems in the rpc.lockd daemon which have caused hangs if an
   application beats on the mechanism too much (and Pine beats on it).
   All of the above mechanisms work reliably over IMAP connections._

Subject: What happens when two Pine sessions access the same mailbox at the same time?

                                       

   This varies depending on what format your folders are stored in. With
   the default Berkeley format, the last session to open a folder will
   get full access to the folder and the previous session(s) will be
   changed to read-only access. When a folder is read-only, you will not
   see any further updates to that folder until it is reopened with full
   access. Currently the INBOX cannot be reopened without exiting and
   restarting Pine. With the Tenex format, any number of sessions can
   simultaneously have full access to a folder, with the exception that
   expunging is disabled. See "What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I
   use it?" for more information.

Content-Description: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

Subject: Why did I get the message "locked, override in _XXX_ sec"?

                                       

   The message "locked, will override in _xxx_ seconds" occurs when Pine
   has discovered that some other mail program claims to be accessing
   your mail folder (i.e. _folder_.lock exists). This is a very low-level
   lock used by programs such as the system mailer in delivering mail,
   and by certain programs such as mail, elm, babyl, mm, etc. Supposedly,
   this lock is only to be acquired and held for a very short period of
   time (less than a second).
   
   It starts with 285 seconds, retries every second, and issues that
   message every 15 seconds. The total period of time, 5 minutes, is the
   time that it will keep on trying before it concludes that the lock is
   false -- that is, that whatever program locked the folder forgot to
   unlock it (perhaps it crashed) -- and Pine will go ahead and claim the
   lock for itself.
   
   This is not due to a conflict between two copies of Pine, since Pine
   interlocks against itself in a higher-level fashion. 
   
   _NOTE: On some systems with 14 character filename limits, attempting
   to open a folder with a 14 character name (e.g. saved-messages) will
   trigger this sequence. Folder names should be limited to 9 characters
   or less on those systems._

Subject: Why is a charset=US-ASCII attachment sent using BASE64 encoding?



   Pine BASE64-encodes all attachments, including text, in order to
   assure that they are not modified in transit. The goal is make sure
   file attachment in Pine is as dependable as FTP (and BASE64 is safer
   than Quoted-Printable). A good example of why this is handy is when we
   recently asked some folks to attach their addressbooks to help us
   track down problems in 3.90, we didn't have to worry about whether a
   gateway had modified a tab or trailing blanks, etc, etc.

   Put addresses and/or list from your address book in the Bcc: (blind

   you compose the message, but they are erased before arriving in other
   people's INBOXes. The Bcc: header is not displayed automatically in

Content-Description: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

Subject: How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

                                       

   Here are a couple ways to use Ispell within Pine: 
    1. Set your alternate-editor to ispell, then ^_ in the composer
       invokes ispell. To do this set "editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell" in
       your .pinerc file. This may be set within Pine via the _OPTIONS_
       task of the _SETUP_ command from the main menu.
       
       Now, when you press ^_ (Control-Underscore) in Pine, you will
       execute the ispell program in its native mode. Press ? for help.
       Press I to insert unknown words into the personal dictionary. You
       can still press Ctrl-T to use the standard pine spell-checking
       program (which will -not- use your personal dictionary). See 'man
       ispell' for more information on the ispell program.
       
    2. Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable so you can
       create the following script and name it spell. 
       

     #!/bin/sh
     ispell -l | sort | uniq 

   To make Ctrl-T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words'
       dictionary: 
          + make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory 
          + make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell' 
          + set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL
            $HOME/spell' (you may include this command in your .profile,
            .cshrc or .login file) 
   
       
       Now, when you press Ctrl-T in Pine, you will execute the ispell
       program, and it will recognize words stored in the private
       dictionary. The screen display will look like pine is using the
       standard spell-checking program. Unfortunately, this method does
       not allow the user to Insert words into the private dictionary.
       However, this might be useful with a central script file (setenv
       SPELL ...) and a central private dictionary (ispell -p ...) to
       provide a common private dictionary for an entire workgroup. The
       manager could add items to the private dictionary; ordinary pine
       users would use the private dictionary (Ctrl-T), but they could
       not change it. 
       
   To use ispell with pico, implement the 'ispell' program via ^T
   (CTRL-T) (using the script file) in addition to implementing it via ^_
   (CTRL-_) (using the .pinerc file). 
     * Use Ctrl-_ in Pine (it won't work in Pico) for full-featured
       ispell. 
     * Use Ctrl-T in Pico to use the ispell program and your
       .ispell_words dictionary (but without the full ispell
       functionality). 
       
   You can use Ctrl-T/ispell in Pine also, but why bother when Ctrl-_
   works better.

Content-Description: How do I read News with Pine?

Subject: How do I read News with Pine?

                                       

   Three ways to access news via Pine: 
    1. Local News. If news is stored on the same machine you run Pine on,
       you can specify: 
       

        news-collections=News *[*]

   
       
    2. Via NNTP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is
       running. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu,
       a typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu/nntp}[*]

   
       
       Alternatively, if the nntp-server variable is set, your
       news-collections will default to NNTP access from the same server.
       
       
    3. Via IMAP. Your .newsrc file must be on the machine where news is
       stored. Assuming news is stored on the machine news.nowhere.edu, a
       typical .pinerc entry would be: 
       

        news-collections=News *{news.nowhere.edu}[*]

   
       
   The advantage of option #3 is that the same .newsrc can be used for
   both Unix Pine and PC-Pine. The disadvantage is that you must have an
   account on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

   Pine does not currently support this directly, but here is a
   work-around: 
    1. Move the cursor to the Cc: line. 
    2. Enter the nickname or press Ctrl-T to search the addressbook and
       select the entry. 
    3. Use Ctrl-K to delete that address from the Cc: line. 
    4. Move the cursor where you want it in the body of the message. 
    5. Press Ctrl-U to insert the address. 
       
   This is kind of a round-about way to get the job done, but it works...

Content-Description: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

Subject: How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?

                                       

   Pine does not do delivery filtering. That function is done by other
   programs, such as "procmail", or "filter" or "deliver".
   
   Once you have set-up your delivery filtering, e.g. via the "filter"
   program, then you will have new mail arriving in several different
   mailboxes/folders, in addition to your INBOX.
   
   So then the question becomes, how do you access those new "incoming
   message" folders that your favorite delivery filter program has
   created? Pine's answer is to let you specify them in your .pinerc, as
   in the example:
   
    
   
 
incoming-folders=Art151           {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-art151,
                 Art-L            {warhol.art.nowhere.edu}filter/to-Art-L,
                 Old-Student-Acct {fozzie.elsewhere.edu}INBOX

   In this case, the pinerc entries presume that your delivery filtering
   program has been configured to put mail relating to the Art151 class
   into the folder "filter/to-art151" and mail relating to the Art-L
   mailing list into "filter/to-Art-L". 
   
   From the Folders List screen, you can then easily access those
   folders. Eventually we will have a way to indicate which of these may
   have new mail waiting for you, so that you don't "forget" that you
   have more than one place to look for new mail...

Subject: Can Kerberos or AFS authentication be used with Pine?

                                       
   Not yet, but Kerberos support is planned for a future release of
   Pine. If you have access to Kerberos or AFS compatible IMAP clients
   already, the following information may be useful. 
  
   The current version of imapd does not support AFS or Kerberos
   authentication.  However, the routine which validates authentication
   is designed as a drop-in module, to allow you to replace with
   alternative authentication schemes such as AFS, Kerberos, S/Key, etc. 
   
   This routine is server_login(). Depending upon which version of
   c-client you have, it is either in the os__xxx_.c (where _xxx_ is the
   name of your port) or it is in a file named log__yyy_.c which is
   included by the os_xxx.c file.
   
   The log__yyy_.c is usually log_std.c (std for "standard UNIX"), but it
   may be log_sv4.c (SVR4) or a couple of other variants. This file only
   contains that one routine, so it should be a simple matter to modify
   that file and rebuild imapd.

   No.  Neither Pine nor PC-Pine currently support POP's offline mail
   model (wherein pending mail is pulled from the mail server to the
   local machine and deleted from the server).  However, it is likely
   that this model will be supported, with a choice of either IMAP or
   POP as the access protocol, in a future release.

Subject: What is a Tenex mailbox and why should I use it?

                                       

   Using the Tenex format for INBOXes allows multiple sessions (or
   mulitple users, subject to the usual access controls) to have *almost*
   full Read-Write access to the INBOX. The only limitation on full RW
   access is that if there are multiple sessions at a given moment, no
   one can do an Expunge. However, message state changes (e.g. marking a
   msg as deleted) *can* be done, and this state is preserved across
   sessions. 
   
   If an explicit Expunge cmd fails, it will say so and tell you that the
   mailbox is in use by another process. When there is only one session
   left using that mailbox, expunge will resume working again.
   
   In contrast: the normal Berkeley style folders can have only one RW
   client at a time, so _given the current software_ the latest session
   steals the RW lock away from any previous session, with the earlier
   session becoming RO.

Subject: Where does Unix Pine look for configuration information?

  
                                     
   In Pine 3.90, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the Main Menu) contain
   a section on Configuration, including default file names and
   environment variables. 

   In brief, Unix Pine uses three configuration files:  a system-wide
   file /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, a system-wide non-overridable file
   /usr/local/lib/pine.fixed, and a personal configuration file
   ~/.pinerc. There are certain options which are only found in system
   wide configurations, others only found in personal configurations, and
   still others found in both. For settings found in both pine.conf and
   .pinerc, values in .pinerc take precedence over those in pine.conf, 
   and settings in pine.conf.fixed take precedence over everything.
   
   If you need to generate a "blank" copy of the system wide
   configuration files, run "pine -conf > /usr/local/lib ". Pine
   automatically generates a .pinerc when a user starts Pine for the
   first time.

   In Pine 3.90, the Release Notes (Press "R" on the Main Menu) contain
   a section on Configuration, including default file names and
   environment variables. 

   In brief, PC-Pine uses the following rules for finding config and
   support files: 

    1. The location of the PINERC is searched for in the following order
       of precedence: 
         1. File pointed to by PINERC environment variable 
         2. $HOME\PINE\PINERC 
         3. A file named PINERC in the same directory as PINE.EXE 
    2. The HOME environment variable, if not set, defaults to root of the
       current working drive. 
    3. The default for external files (PINE.SIG and ADDRBOOK) is the same
       directory as the PINERC file. 
    4. The support files (PINE.HLP and PINE.NDX) are searched for in the 
       same directory as PINE.EXE.

   You have several options:
   
    1. Leave inbox in /usr/spool/mail, but turn on the Pine option to
       prompt users to move read messages to a folder in their home
       directory upon exiting Pine. 
    2. Modify your mail delivery program to deliver mail directly into
       the user's home directory, and specify that inbox-path in your
       global pine.conf (See the "tmail" program on
       ftp.cac.washington.edu for an example.) 
    3. "touch mail.txt" in each home directory, which will cause Pine
       (upon startup) to pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mail.txt
       -- however, mail.txt will be a Tenex-format, rather than Berkeley
       mail format folder (faster, but non-standard). 
    4. Link in the "mbox" driver when you build Pine. This driver will
       (upon Pine startup) pull mail from /usr/spool/mail into ~/mbox,
       which will be a Bky-format folder.

Subject: How can someone without a MIME-aware mail program decipher an attachment?

                                       
   

   Regarding attachments: Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for this.
   MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) uses "Base64" encoding
   rather than uuencode, because uuencode uses characters that are
   transformed by some email gateways, and there are also several
   incompatible versions of uuencode.
   
   However, you can certainly uuencode a file outside of pine, then use
   the Composer's Ctrl-R (file inclusion) command to insert the encoded
   file in the message.
   
   If you use Pine's attachment feature, your recipient does need to have
   MIME-capable software. Fortunately, this is not hard to find. Even the
   major proprietary mail vendors have committed to MIME support, but
   some of their upgraded products are still some months away. One
   product which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available from ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the /pub/mpack
   directory.

Subject: PC-Pine 3.90 and Netware VLM problem solved
Date: 16 Sep 1994 17:52:39 GMT
Message-Id: <35cm17$7fc@lastactionhero.rs.itd.umich.edu>

 I've tracked down the problem with Netware that I've mentioned here
 before.

 On the machines that I was doing testing on, we are using a different
 printing service than what is provided with Netware.  So the PRINT.VLM
 file was removed from the loadset.  It's been that way for months.

 Then yesterday, while digging through some documentation to solve a
 different problem I found a few configuration options to tell Netware
 not to load the print module, even if it was on disk.  Put the
 PRINT.VLM file back and set the appropriate option in NET.CFG and
 restarted.  Received the same start up screens telling me that netware
 printing services were not available, etc.

 After that, when I tried PC-Pine 3.90, it no longer broke the netware
 mappings.

 So it appears to be that this particular version of PC-Pine was the
 only program to pick up on a Netware glitch.

There seem to be some other problems with putting Content-Type:
into customized-hdrs that my initial tests didn't catch. 

I recently got this reply from a correspondent:

> May I ask why your messages are showing up with the following headers:

I *did* test that NOT explicitly setting Content-Type: in the
Rich Header view caused a normal message ( with only one
"Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII" header. ) 

I believe the multiple "TEXT/PLAIN;" in the Pine generated header
is a side effect of postponing and resuming a message. ( and the
more times you do it, the more times it gets appended to the header. )

More on this after I've had a chance to run some definitive tests, 
but I wanted to warn anyone who tries it that there are still some
problems. ( This is a different problem from the one previously
reported, but if I'm correct that the problem is with Postpone,
they may be related. ) 

Neither Pine3.90 and elm+metamail have trouble displaying the 
message and neither complain about the header, so it won't 
be noticable unless you turn on full header display, or unless
you get a complaint from someone who has trouble reading it.

Yeah, I know.  Mine says the proper things.  As I said, the first time it 
worked fine.  The next time it just kept going around in circles, telling 
me to re-boot, etc., but never arriving at a conclusion!  I finally got

I've since tried switching ethernet cards for another problem -- the 
board may have just been loose -- so maybe I'll give it another shot 
just to see if it can be *better*!  Thanks anyway, at least I don't have to

There is a little problem with memmaker in the latest DOS that might be 
causing that problem (now that I think of it).  Does your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
file include the full sequence for loggin onto the server?  I found that 
if AUTOEXEC.BAT includes:

	lsl
	smcplus
	ipxodi
	next
	f:
	login

memmaker will have big problems, similar to what you described.  But taking 
out those last two lines will take care of it.  

As for "Windows crap", well, some of us have gotten Windows to work quite 
nicely, thank you very much. ;-)

Steve,
I want to caution that in trying to override MIME headers, you are working 
way out on the edge, with no net...

We never intended the custom header mechanism to be the right way to 
handle this problem, and make no promises about whether that approach
will work in future releases.

As you've heard me say before: we know we have a ways to go in this area.
And as interesting as your experiments are, I just want to make sure that 
no one else gets inadvertently led down the garden path...

Once the dust settles on 3.9x, I'd like to have another conversation about
what MIME typing facilities you need to accomplish your objectives.

For some reason, my Pine (v. 3.89) no longer seems to put the cursor on

checke din .pinerc, but didn't find an option to change that.  Can 
anybody help me change this?

Hi,

I had a user report that he attempted to enter his passwd 3 times 
unsuccessfully (due to the CAP-LOCK key) and PC-PINE sort of locked up.

I know, 'sort of locked up'?  By this I mean, you can no longer attempt to
log in(waited about 10 minutes) but selecting Options, About or Help from
the menu works.  Also, I can't find a way to close PC-Pine.  The only 
way to close pine was to exit windows.

Is this the expected behavior?

Has anyone else seen this?

Well, it worked while we had pine.conf in /usr/local/lib (and pine in 
/usr/local/bin), but now that we've moved the executable and config file, 
the executable doesn't see the config file.

The executable is now in /home/software2/bin/, and the pine.conf is 
now in /home/software2/lib/pine.conf/. What to do?

Thanks a lot,
LT

Low-tech solution: Place the addresses in the Bcc field.

Higher-tech solution: Establish a mailing list.

The path to pine.conf is hard-coded to /usr/local/bin.  You can either move
pine.conf back, make a link to it, or change the source...

Try using the traditional Unix mail, just to see if it will 're-build'
your mailbox, in case the problem's in the mailbox itself.  There might
also be a problem with the drive that the mail is stored on.  Try
df /usr/spool/mail from the Unix prompt and see if there's space left
on the drive.  In any event, your system's admin staff would be the
folks that can help with the latter case, and, as you said, they're
in short supply on the weekends.

 I would like to send some msdos shareware, etc that I discovered on the
'net to a colleague. I have a mac, so I can't simply download and give
him the disk. I have ftp'd the apps he needs into my account at our
server (unix) but now I don't know how to get it to him.
Could I email them to him? ( of course, I have to figure out how to get
them out of my main directory into my Mail directory first :-) ! )
Could I simply transfer them from my directory to his ? (How?)
 
Any assistance / advice etc would be appreciated, privately or here.
Thank you :  Eliz.Bonnett

Subject: "Serious error" message -- help!!
Date: 18 Sep 1994 00:05:49 -0400
Message-Id: <35geat$oub@access3.digex.net>

Several times today, when I've tried reading or writing mail in PINE, 
all of a sudden, my computer has beeped twice and I've gotten a message 
that says something like, "Serious error in /usr/spool/mail/trow," and I 
either have to type ! to get to the shell or return to try saving again. 
It doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing in PINE -- I can be reading or 
deleting messages, or be in the middle of composing a message. It's been 
going on for over 18 hours now and I'm getting worried. Does anyone know 
what the problem could be? There's no help desk staff here on the 
weekends, so if anyone can help me out, please post (don't send mail, for 
obvious reasons!!).

Hi,

Unfortunately whenever I have that problem the only way I can fix
in is by manually inspecting all the mailbox and manually removing
the null characters which are bound to be in there and fixing up the
confused from lines/...
 
Unfortunately if you don't know what format the mailbox should be in
it's pretty hard to go in and fix this yourself.
 
I'd suggest you need to wait until support or a more unix-aware friend
is available to help you.
 
regards,
   glenn.

Subject: Does this debugfile from a pine3.90 crash tell anything ?
Date: 18 Sep 1994 06:24:13 GMT
Message-Id: <35gmed$9am@woodstock.socs.uts.EDU.AU>


Hi,

Firstly a public thanks to the pine development team for all 
the work that they've done on pine. 

With the release of version 3.90 I was able to compile pine
on an AIX 3.2 system which I had been unable to compile 
version 3.89 on (actually could compile, just not run without
core dumping all the time).

The first time I ran the 3.90 I compiled on the AIX system it
exited dumping core (unfortunately built without debug) so all
I have is the following pine debug file output.  I haven't
been able to reproduce the crash as yet, but am worried as 
even one crash would prompt alot of problems for the help desk
people on that system.

Anyone see anything useful in the pine debug output ?

thanks for your help.

regards,
  glenn.

Following in the idea of improving postponed mail, will be nice if one could
use jump like in any other index...
also, while in index, perhaps implementing the cursor keys in such a way
that the right arrow will do the same as the "enter" key...

thanks for pine, in any case

Subject: Various questions
Date: Sun, 18 Sep 94 18:06 SST

I've just installed the pine3.90 . It works great.
I have a couple of questions though:

1. How do I set my 'From:' field to display: <host!user>
rather than <user@host> ? I've managed to do this by 
patching smail3.1.28.1 when the field was not in angle
brackets. Is this something you can change in pine or
smail3.1.28 ?

2. Is it possible to have more than one field in the
'Reply-To:' header? Eg:
  Reply-To: ivan%king@ncb.gov.sg,ivan%shim@csah.com
Pine seems to use the comma to separate them into two
header fields.

3. When I type 'H' while reading the text, it doesn't work.
Am I missing a setting?

Please reply by e-mail. Thanks.

Ivan Shim

Hey all,
	I'm a newbie so please bear with me. I was wondering...I know
ELM prompts the user to put all received msgs in a received folder. IS
there any way to configure PINE to do the same thing each time? Also,
I was wondering how do I go about obtaining the latest copy of pine? I
have the ftp site and dir, but I'm a little sketchy as to which files
I need. I'm running it off dial in unix provided by Boston University.
Thanks for your help, and please e-mail me at jkaiman@acs.bu.edu with
your suggestions. Thanks again,

Hello,
	Could anyone mail me a manual of pine and pico? Because I cannot man

Subject: Re: "Serious error" message -- help!!
Date: Sun, 18 Sep 1994 13:29:10 -0700
Message-Id: <Pine.NXT.3.91.940918125827.7787A-100000@Tomobiki-Cho.CAC.Washington.EDU>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
In-Reply-To: <35gmuq$9b5@woodstock.socs.uts.EDU.AU> 

This is probably the error message that comes from mm_diskerror() in
Pine's imap.c code.  This in turn is called by the mailbox update routines
in the c-client library.  What has happened is pretty bad.  That's why
it's called a ``serious'' error! ;-)

At certain times in a Pine session -- specifically at expunge, mailbox
close, and checkpoint -- a mbox or mmdf format mailbox is completely
rewritten.  Essentially, the in-memory copy of the mailbox is dumped out
to the disk, replacing the previous disk copy.  Because Status: and
X-Status: lines may be added to a message, it is possible that the mailbox
may end up being *larger* after the rewrite instead of smaller. 

To avoid the possibility of hitting a quota exceeded or disk-full 
condition, an extremely conservative worst-case calculation of the 
potential growth of the mailbox is made.  Nulls are then appended to the 
mailbox to make sure that the mailbox can grow by that many bytes.  If 
this fails, you get a ``non-serious'' disk error that says.  This is the 
familiar message you get when you've popped your disk quota and Pine 
declines even to expunge.

If the null appending succeeds, the mailbox is overwritten with the
in-memory data.  When it is finished, the mailbox is truncatated to the
proper size; this tosses out the nulls (and the remnants of messages prior
to expunging).  This overwrite is guaranteed to write, at worst, as many
bytes as are already there and most likely will write far fewer bytes. 

If, however, the overwrite fails, you get a ``serious'' error.  At this
point, the disk copy of the mailbox is hosed.  The c-client library in
Pine has gone modal, refusing to return control to Pine until it does a
successful rewrite of the mailbox from the in-memory copy.  At this point,
your mailbox and your Pine process need professional help! 

A ``serious'' error is simply not supposed to happen.  It is believed to 
be impossible on most versions of UNIX.  It is theoretically possible if 
a particular UNIX kernel behaves in a particularly bad way, but it is 
claimed that no versions of UNIX do so.

Thus, I am very concerned about reports of ``serious'' errors.  Each
``serious'' error represents a damaged mailbox, and we are committed to
ensure that Pine never damages mailboxes.  If, as has been suggested, we
make the ``worst-case'' estimate less conservative and not do it at all on
expunge, we run a possibly increased risk of ``serious'' errors.  I would
rather that the initial risk be zero.

I am especially interested to know:
 1) What flavor of UNIX you are running (vendor, BSD/SysV, version).
 2) If maximum file size limits are in effect, and if so what is the limit.
 3) If disk quotas are in effect, and if so what is the user's quota and
     current usage.
 4) Amount of usable free space on the disk.
 5) Size of the mailbox in bytes and number of messages.
 6) *Complete* text of the error message (not a paraphrase).

Thank you for your assistance!!!!

Have you tried the on-line help within the programs?  Every pine or pico 
screen has a "Get Help" command in the menu at the bottom of the screen.

If you need to change your pine configuration (.pinerc file), the .pinerc 
file itself contains extensive comments.

I am confused regarding setting the Incoming-Folders and Folder-
Collections in the .pinerc file for adding additional folders to which
some "filtered" mail is sent.  My system uses Pine 3.89.  My incoming mail
is sent to /var/mail/bloomis as I have been able to determine from looking
at my environment.  The .pinerc file contains an example for adding
additional incoming folders as follows:

incoming-folders=Consulting  {carson.u.washington.edu}filter/to-help

If I am filtering messages from the lynx-dev mailing list might I do the
following to satisfy Pine:

incoming-folders=Lynx   {skypoint.skypoint.com}filter/to-lynx  ??

What I am confused in the above example is the placement of "Consulting",
and "to-help"?Any help would be appreciated.

I'm cross-posting this to digex.general because others may be interested
to hear about my "serious" error, which is apparently fairly rare. And
perhaps someone can help with the questions I don't know the answers to. 
(I'm not a "power UNIX" user by any means, I'm afraid.) To recap: I was
using Pine a couple of days ago, when all of a sudden I got a weird error
message (the text of which is included a few paragraphs down).

Wow! I feel, uh, unique.  :-)

I use a public-access internet provider (Digital Express in Greenbelt, 
MD). I'm not sure what "flavor" they run.

Don't know.

We don't really have disk quotas; we're permitted 5 mb and we are charged 
6 cents a day for each megabyte over the limit.

Don't know.

I had a *lot* of messages in my mailbox, I will admit...I subscribe to a 
few mailing lists, and one of them in particular has had MUCH more 
traffic than usual during the past week or so (it's a music list and the 
artist just included an email address in the liner notes of his brand-new 
album). I also had quite a few saved messages. In other words, I've been 
a little lax in my cyber-housekeeping. I'll never do it again!! (sob)

> 6) *Complete* text of the error message (not a paraphrase).

Serious error saving mail folder "/usr/spool/mail/trow":

Press return to retry saving or press ! to get system prompt.

Please attempt to correct the error preventing the saving of the mail 
folder. For example, if the disk is out of space, try removing uneeded 
(sic) files. You might also contact your system administrator.

>Thank you for your assistance!!!!

Thanks for your input.

BTW, I tried removing some of my message folders, and moving others to my 
home directory. It didn't help, though.

I would like to run a script everytime that pine sends a message.
Using default-fcc=<a call to my script> seemed like a good idea,
but I don't seem to be able to do this... Any ideas? Many thanks.

This sums up my experience completely, as well.

New users are even starting to use pine for usenet reading, finding it
easier to use than tin, and with Pico integrated for both news and mail.

On the other hand, I've used elm for years and am very comfortable with
vi.  However, I'll choose pine over elm hands-down for MIME messages, the
present "invoke metamail" solution doesn't "do much" for me.

I'm in search of someone who has run Pine on VMS.  I've retrieved the claimed port 
from vms.huji.ac.il.  The code appears to be missing a key file called os_vms.c if you 
get the pine_vms_fixes.tar file and follow the instructions.  The pine_beta_9.bck file 
appears to be unretrievable by me, at least intact.  The format of this VMS Backup 
saveset is not maintained when ftp'd(I'm stuck with UCX on VMS...no stru vms).

If anyone has been successful using this port or if you could point me toward another 
option, it would be much appreciated.  I know about the client in PMDF, but 
Innosoft's new pricing scheme makes that no longer an option.

You can define the directory where the system wide pine.conf lives
in the file pine3.90/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h

Here's what I did:

#define SYSTEM_PINERC             "/sw/share/pine-3.90/lib/pine.conf"
#define SYSTEM_PINERC_FIXED       "/sw/share/pine-3.90/lib/pine.conf.fixed"

BTW could somebody explain the function of the pine.conf.fixed to me?

Subject: Printing to local Mac printer.
Date: 19 Sep 1994 07:21:22 GMT
Message-Id: <35je5i$4tq@mark.ucdavis.edu>

I have not ever been able to get a Mac to print to a local printer when 
trying to print from pine.  (My connection is through a 
dial-up connection to a unix account.)

I have a Mac LC with a HP DeskWriter.  (I print through a print spooler 
program called "HP PrintMonitor" that comes with the Deskwriter).  My 
communications software is Microphone LT.

I have no problems printing to a locally attached printer at work, but 
it's a PC, not a Mac.  My wife, who has a Mac at work, cannot get her Mac 
to print to her office printer to either (also a dial-up connection).

When you invoke the "print" command in pine, it asks "print using 
`attached-to-ANSI?'"  (What other choice to I have?)  I answer "yes."

Then a Mac dialogue box pops up that reads:

	An error #-192 occured while trying to print.
	Please check your printer.  
        ----
        |ok|
        ----
I click on "OK," and then pine says:

	[Printing to attached desktop printer.]

But, nothing happens.  Nothing prints.  (And I have a hard time getting 
pine to move on to something else (it thinks it's still printing).

Is there some special trick to get pine (version 3.90) to print to a 
local Mac printer?

I don't know if this is a bug, or my problem. However, when I use pine to
read from new-group folders, and I want to use the GOTO folder option,
I can only go to mail folders and not to newsgroup folders.

Any suggestions?

I am running 3.90 on a DEC OSF/1 system. The whereis command seems to behave
differently from the description in the help pages: has anyone else seen
this ?

At the folder list screen, I press w and am prompted to enter a search word.
When this is given, all messages whose subject/author contains the word are
selected. This occurs whether or not I have enabled aggregate operations.
With agg.ops. on, I am offered ^X to "select matches", even though they are
already selected. In fact ^X steps to the first selected message.

Also, if the cursor is on a message which matches the given word, whereis
doesn't find that message, only the other ones.

Confused (but only 'cos I read the help page :)

Andrew

I've just installed Pine 3.90 (DEC Alpha running OSF/1) and am seriously 
seriously impressed!

One question though, I'm using an NNTP news server for news access and 
decided to delete the posts that I had read....I left the group, went 
back, and they're no longer there!....fantastic!

Lets assume that I'm upto date with my news and only have a few postings 
in my group......what If I want to see the old ones again....I've tried 
unSubscribing and reSubscribing but that doesn't bring back all the old 
postings that I've already read.......is there a way to achieve this?

I am having trouble creating a new folder for Pine under VMS.
What could I have done wrong in my .pinerc file?  The message
is always that the folder name I have chosen already exists.
This is not true, so what could be the cause?  Any suggestions
would be appreciated.

It's important in list-servs that people modify Subject: and To: lines to 
allow readers to scan incoming mail efficiently.

In Pine, the various text editing conveniences are not extended to the 
header line.  ^K works to delete the whole thing.  ^D and ^H delete one 
character at a time.  But you can't mark text and delete, or search, or 
do other useful things.

(At least, I haven't been able to figure out how to do those things.)

So, a request for future versions of pine is to extend the full range of 
editing and moving commands to the header fields.

Thanks for all you do.

Message-Id: <35kocf$98j@controversy.math.lsa.umich.edu>

In order not to provide e-mail service for our educational labs we set an
environmental variable in the system wide .cshrc to determine which mailserver
to contact so the student can read mail. The line the .pinerc looks like:

inbox-path={$MAILSERVER}inbox

This worked fine under pine 3.89 and now doesn't under pine3.90. It looks like
the environment variables are no longer used when the .pinerc is read in. Any 
suggestions or work arounds?

Yup.

inbox-path=${MAILSERVER}inbox

You had the right idea, just had the left brace in the wrong spot. This 
should work for you now.

One of my users connects to the system via DataPac and has just recently 
tried to use Pine3.90. For some reason the error message "Command '^S' 
not defined for this screen. Use ? for help." appears, and re-appears, ad 
nauseum, until the only option left is to kill the  process.

This account works just fine otherwise, and pine works fine when logging 
in directly. It appears only to happen when using DataPac.

Has anyone else experienced a similar problem, or perhaps do you know 
what may be causing this?

We run DG/UX 5.4.201. TIA

Ms. Feingold,
	
	If you've setup Pine to read NNTP news, you can hit ctrl-N to go 
to Next Collection when in the GOTO option.  That should switch from your 
mail folder collection to your news collections.

"Consulting" is the (optional) nickname that will show up on the folder list
and "to-help" is the name of the folder.  Some people try to attach
additional semantics to the name "to-help" but it is simply a filename.

Subject: Disconnected use of wpine..???
Date: 19 Sep 1994 18:24:42 GMT
Message-Id: <35kl1a$t0f@jethro.Corp.Sun.COM>

Hi all,

I am trying to figure out if it is possible to use wpine to do the following. I
would appreciate any help/ideas/comments...

I am using wpine under ms-windows over ppp. Is it possible for me to access
the mailbox on my server, then somehow cache some and/or all messages to the
pc, then disconnect from the net (close ppp connection) go on a trip (or outside
in my backyard), read, reply, delete, and send new mail,  then reconnect with
my server and have all my changes played back and my mailbox updated. I suspect
that this is possible with the use of IMAP but I have no idea if I can or how
I can do it with wpine.

Again I would appreciate any help. Please send me e-mail unless you think that
your reply would be interesting to others in which case you can post it on the group.
Thanks again,

  Alex

Is there a way to make the rich headers (Ctrl-R) default? That way I

I like to save the different subjects to a folder and down load the 
folder to Word Perfect to edit and store. Any info would be great.

Of course, using elm does not tie one to using vi.

And I'd say that this is true for sending simple MIME messages.  But since
elm has had metamail hacked into it, elm's MIME interface is more global. 
(This makes it especially nice on reading MIME messages.)

So, for me, there are two things that I really like about pine:

(1) It is real nice for browsing folders, and
(2) You can edit the expanded aliases in the message headers.

and at least one thing that I like about elm:

(1) It's small and, therefore, faster.

FWIW, I've configured both of them to behave as close to one another as 
possible (same Mail directory, folder styles, queries regarding writes, 
etc) and use the best one for the job at hand.

cheers,
john

This message seems almost the reverse of my problem, and I wonder if they 
can be connected.

I can print very well from Pine, but the problem is that my HPLaserejet 
III spits out an extra blank page at the end of every item being printed.
In addition, I have the same problem when I print out a newsgroup item in 
tin.

I'll be interested to see the followup messages.

Message-Id: <35lfdp$hte@sashimi.wwa.com>

I have been having difficulty getting mt HP LaserJet 4L printer to eject 
the last page when printing from PINE.  Also, I can't the printer to 
print blank lines.  I know the line feed and form feed codes are being 
sent, but the printer does not receive them (or do what they tell it to do).

I am using an IBM clone PC.  My communications packsge is BitCom 5.3B.  I 
print PINE with option 1, Print to attached ANSI printer.  I am emulating 
a vt100 terminal with ANSI support.

Any ideas would be helpful.  Thanks.

I prefer Pine over Elm because Pine is the easiest to use and seems to be
more powerful for the average user.   I can get as technical as people want,
but prefer ease of use and good power.

	No, but you have a choice where you want your signature to go.

	Go into "SetUp" and into "Configure" look around and you will
find an option for "signature at bottom".

	Wouldn't you say since pine 3.90 supports a .mailcap file that
it is just as "global" in this respect as elm?

Jim, Todd:

I'm not sure about the FCC/sent-mail problem (send more details to 
pine-bugs if you have them), but the missing two characters in the folder 
names sounds like you might be using the bogus version of imapd for Suns that
was originally in our /pine/unix-bin directory.  A corrected version is 
there now.  If that doesn't explain it, send more info on your environment.
The "off by two" bug has to do with a mismatch in Sun's BSD vs. SVR4 
library routines for reading directories.

Just an idea. For those that don't believe in deleting mail, how about an option
to transparently use compressed folder files like zcat, zgrep, etc.

Jack,
There are some unresolved reports of problems in this area with 3.90, but 
since you are not using 3.90...

There are two ways to have Pine append only the host-less domain name to 
incomplete addresses:

 1. Set the "user-domain" variable.  e.g. "user-domain=cyberspace.com"

 2. Set "use-only-domain-name=yes" but also make sure that your /etc/hosts
    file lists your host with its *full* name first, and the nickname last.

Note that Pine is a strictly RFC822 mailer and makes no distinction between 
local and non-local mail.

One of the users here had a problem where Pine 3.90a would just hang at 
start-up time when he invoked it.  After some investigation he determined 
that it was the attached message out of the hundreds in his inbox which 
was the culprit.

If it's saved as a mail folder then invoking pine on it results in this:

mike@hibbert{q9}[4] pine -f elr.n 


Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
zsh: 16992 floating point exception  pine -f elr.n

but when it's in the inbox all that happens is pine seems to hang up.

(the message has two 'From ' lines, removing either of them "fixes" the 
problem)

Not unless it addresses all MIME-types in the way that metamail, et al, 
do.  Perhaps it does and I'm just not aware of that fact.

Message-Id: <1994Sep20.050655.13496@chico.iecc.com>
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 05:06:55 GMT

I'm putting together the upcoming "Internet Secrets" to be published
by IDG Books.  Secrets books are compilations of tips and tricks from
expert users, and I'm looking for some people who are interesting in
contributing to the book.  All contributions are credited (unless for
some reason you want to be anonymous) and you get a copy of the book
when it comes out (it's a $49.95 book, don't laugh).  For substantial
chunks, like a full chapter, we can offer modest amounts of actual
money.

Topics we're looking for range from the utterly technical (how to
tune a WWW server) to the fairly sociological (is it really a bad
idea to e-mail credit card info).  There will also be disks in the
back; so we're looking for interesting software for the disks,
particularly stuff to help you get up and running, since once you're
on the net FTP is easier.

In particular, we're looking for someone to write about the major mail
programs (elm, mh, etc.) and try to explain why you might prefer one
over the other.  The more grotty warts, the better.

Material need not be 100% new; in many cases an adaptation of an existing
FAQ would be great.  Even though FAQs tend to change every month, for many
readers a printed version of a FAQ is still very useful since A) you can
get it before you have net access and B) you can read it in the bathroom.
We'd want a pointer to the on-line FAQ, of course, so people can get the
latest versions.

If interested, drop me a line at contrib@dummies.com.

Being an e-mail support person I could recount several pros/cons either 
way but personally I miss the j/k keys when using pine :)  Why.. 'cause I 
like to keep my hands on the home row like I was taught.

Pine's mailcap support is definitely immature at this point.  It does not 
do everything you'd want it to do yet.

We have been using pine3.90 on our dgux aviion machine
for a month or two now, and I want to put it on a secondary
SCO Unix 486 server.  However, we only have a runtime
OS -- can anyone point me to compiled SCO binaries for
pine3.90, imap etc?  Thanks...

I've been looking into why Pine seems so slow to start and I think I have 
discovered that it is related to the fact that it is trying to rsh to my 
remote host rather than open a tcp connection to port 143.  Is there an easy
way to shut off the rsh feature, since none of my Pine hosts support 
rsh'ing to my mail server and I don' like waiting for my mail to open...

We get exactly the same thing with 3.89.  It seems to happen more on our
SPARCServer 2000 than our 1000. We have no ideas why.

I was just able to induce it by sending the pine's parent ksh a
SIGKILL, but then the next few time I was not able to induce it.
If anyone has any suggestions, please come forth. :-)

Microphone Light and got it to work with a Laser Printer so it could be
something with your HP software. 

Try selecting the LaserWriter driver and turning on background printing.
You won't be able to get output, of course, but if things work okay you
should at least get a file spooled to disk and find out whether Microphone
Light works or not with Pine's attached-to-ansi mode.

Hi. I know there have probably been numerous people asking this
question, but not until recently have I had this problem.

I would like to know how to filter incoming messages from users.
In other words, I don't want to receive any mail from certain people.
I understand that this is what is called 'kill file'?

I attempted to set up a .filter program suggested here some months
back, but I am not sure if it is even being executed by pine, or
I have to manually execute it each time?  Apparently it is not
working!

If someone could be so kind to please tell me what I can do, I
will appreciate it tremendously. Respond here or through email.

Thank you.

Jaime

	What you want is either "procmail", "filter" (from the elm distribution)
or one of a number of other programs that will process incoming email.

	These are seprate from pine.  You don't *normally* don't run them
manually either.  The are invoked automatically when mail is delivered.

	You can get procmail from:

A recent version can be picked up at various comp.sources.misc archives.
The latest version can be obtained directly from the ftp-archive at:

Hi,

I (and quite a few other users here) are 
very impressed with the way the UNIX pine email program can 
print to a local PC or Mac printer while in
a telnet session. ("Y" - print)

Is there an equivalent stand alone program like
pico to print any file to a local DOS or Mac
printer from a telnet session.  In pine, this
is done via ANSI codes?

If not a stand alone program, is there a way pine can do
this.  A few staff here use pico not as an editor but
as a UNIX file manager for deleting and renaming files.
Hopefully the same can be done with printing?

Thanks in advance,

Lachlan.

The documentation is pretty sparse, and my sysop isn't being

YOUR help is greatly appreciated and needed!

On a side-track, I've got complaints about both - neither lend
themselves well to "infosurfing" - most UNIX curses based
applications I use (lynx, gopher, custom stuff) can be controlled
using the arrow keys, and are arranged in a hierarchical
structure. 

Neither have the structure I'd like to see:

               +---             +---
               |                |
Folder list ---+--- Messages ---|    Message Text
               |                |
               +---             +---


Both Pine and Elm approach this, but both shuffle folder changing
off to one side. I'd like to start off in my inbox (and have Pine
set up to do that), but moving around when you have the above
topology in mind is "difficult".

My biggest (read HUGE, read the reason I only touch it to read
metamail things our Elm setup doesn't support like richtext and
saving attachments) grip about Pine is that you can't "surf" with
it; in Elm (and trn for that matter), once you're moving in the
right direction, hitting space lets you keep going. Pine
doesn't. Which forces you to keep track of where you are in the
above type of hierarchy - and remember, I'm lazy. I want the best
of both worlds.

Just some late night ramblings. :)

There is a very short program called ansiprt in the contrib/utils 
directory of the Pine source distribution that will print from a Telnet 
session.

Subject: Hack needed for PC Pine
Date: 21 Sep 1994 00:38:42 -0700
Message-Id: <35onu2$kpt@svpal.svpal.org>

We are looking for a hack for the Windows version of PC Pine 3.90.

Our host is an exceedingly slow Sun Unix box.  Many of us poor users
wish to run Pine locally, but without a SMPT Server.  At this point,
we can download (via Zmodem) our INBOX and any folders that we may
have.  Then, we can view/compose our e-mail at our leisure.  We'd
also be able to archive our mail.

The problem arises when we try to [C]ompose or [R]eply.  We would
like for Pine to invoke "our favorite" text editor, from which we
could simply save a text file that we could later upload to our
host.  From there we'd invoke Unix Pine, [^R]ead in our text file
and then mail it.

Unfortunately, PC Pine issues the error: 
      Cannot send message without an open remote folder
the instant we try to [C]ompose or [R]eply.

Does anybody out there have a hack.....please.

There doesn't seem to be.  I have problems doing just about anything else 
Unix-related on my Mac, but I can easily print to my Laserwriter.  I just 
followed the instructions in Pine's SETUP menu and everything worked 
fine.  I have Microphone Pro, so I know Microphone products can do this.  
Perhaps there is a problem in your Microphone transfer settings.

How is pine at threaded newsreading? Can it manage threads? If so, how? 
I've been using trn, which manages threads quite well. I'd use pine if it 
were better at it.

Martin, 

The pine.conf.fixed file allows the pine/system administrator to setup
Pine variables that are fixed and cannot be overridden by any user. 

Here is a copy of my pine.conf.fixed file:

#     System wide FIXED Pine options

feature-list= disable-update-cmd,
        no-enable-suspend,
        no-enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
	no-enable-unix-pipe-cmd

I'd like to hear more about this because when I tried to use PINE for
newsreading, I found it much inferior and harder to use than tin.
Note that on our "easy-to-use" machine, we default users to PICO instead
of vi or emacs so they are using tin/pico.  However, I have to admit that
I am a NN user personally, but my users are using tin (nn is not public
because it likes to crash in my environment and every once in a while
destroy a .newsrc file).

On the original topic, I agree with "I prefer Elm; my users prefer PINE".
However, I've always used PINE for certain things like sending MIME, but
with 3.90 I've gone from using PINE about 10% to closer to 25%.

Check out anonymous FTP to soils.agron.iastate.edu in /pub/sco/unix/pine 
for a package of the various binaries of pine (Pine, Pico, Imapd, Ipop?d) 
and their associated man pages.

However, know that there is a bug in the MMDF code of the shipping Pine
source and binaries that, once in a blue moon, will make your Pine
core-dump.  By "once in a blue moon" I mean that when a message is placed
perfectly within an 8K block, so you have a one-in-8000 chance of
crashing, and then only if you have enough messages to put you into more
than one 8K block.  If this happens to you, clean up the lock files, and 
edit by hand the mailbox to remove any one character from an early 
message.  That will shift the subsequent messages enough to not core-dump 
any more.

The Pine folks know about the bug and have fixed it internally.  It'll be 
better in the next release.  It's not a simple patch, however, so it's 
not the sort of thing they can make available in a simple patch file.

Well, Pine don't thread.  Pine likes very much to treat everything as
mail, so the subtle distinctions of mailing a reply or posting a followup
are lost.  One thing I like is that it's finally possible for me to post
and mail a followup at the same moment (I use Tin, and I'm not aware that
that function is supported).  Pine is much less convenient for functions 
like killing a subject (though it's possible, it takes a bit of work), 
and for existing News readers (people, not programs), the change in 
approach is a bit weird.  However, I expect for beginners brought up in 
Pine, it'll be just fine.

Oh, one technical nit - the attribution line in followups (replies to the 
newsgroup, actually) don't mention the article we're citing.  And I 
haven't looked at the "References:" headers.  Does anyone know if these 
are handled properly?

I just started using Pine 3.89 on a VMS system.  Pine does not seem to read my
personal_name although it uses others' personal_names and reads them into
address book files.  

Suggestions on how to activate personal_name would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

(Apologies to the purists ahead of time.)

I prefer elm because it's better able to deal with the nasty
Content-length stuff I get all the time from other SVR4-mailx-/bin/mail
users.  Pine simply separates all the included messages, while elm
mostly gets them right.

I have configured the sco machine to use sendmail -- will this bug
still occur?  Not that I will lose much sleep over it... Thanks very

This may have been already addressed, if so please forgive me.  My question is whether pine
can move the net news information directly into the INBOX, so that you don't have to go
to the net-news folders to read the mail?  This is important for users who are using off-line
mail readers.  If they can get all of their usenet mail as regular e-mail, it would eliminate
another logon to a computer, especially using dial up access.

Thanks

I talked to one of our system admins about this and he corrected the
problem.  All he told me was that he changed some of the code for
imapd and recompiled it.  It works fine now.

The recent discussion about pine as a newsreader reminded me of this 
question about pines functionality as such. Does pine have the capability 
to check for new newsgroups? If not, it'd be really nice. If so, how?

Are you using the Innosoft (PMDF) port or the Bourvine port of Pine to VMS?

I offer a humble suggestion/wish to the developers of Pine.  When printing
tagged mail (multiple messages), can a form feed code be added so that
each individual mail message is printed on a separate page of paper? 
Currently, when I print tagged messages to the laser they all run
together. 

I realize that you may already be aware of this.

My compliments to the development team for Pine 3.9.  It's great.

Subject: Fixes for sorting by Subject with PC-Pine 3.90 (LONG)
Date: 21 Sep 1994 19:55:06 GMT
Message-Id: <35q32q$hp0@lastactionhero.rs.itd.umich.edu>

I've done some more digging around and think I've fixed sorting by subject
with PC-Pine 3.90.  Below is the text I sent to my supervisor and to the pine
team describing what I changed.

--Allan 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(All of the following changes occur in mailindx.c.)

The first change is made after the DOS declaration of subcache.
Two character buffers are added and I will explain their use below.


#if     defined(DOS) && !defined(_WINDOWS)
#define SUB_CACHE_LEN   128
static struct subcache {
    long   size, cur;
    char   *buf;
    FILE  *ent;
} *subcache = NULL;

char suba[SUB_CACHE_LEN];   <----- Added line
char subb[SUB_CACHE_LEN];   <----- Added line
#else




These next changes are to accommodate the static buffers that were added
above.  They take place in compare_subjects.  Here is the modified
source:

int
compare_subjects(a, b)
    const QSType *a, *b;
{
#if !defined(DOS) || defined(_WINDOWS)            <---- Added line
    char *suba, *subb;
#endif                                            <---- Added line
    long *mess_a = (long *)a, *mess_b = (long *)b;
    int   diff, res;
    long  mdiff;

    sort_blip();

#if !defined(DOS) || defined(_WINDOWS)            <---- Added line
    suba = get_sub(*mess_a);
    subb = get_sub(*mess_b);
#else                                             <---- Added line
    strcpy(suba,get_sub(*mess_a));                <---- Added line
    strcpy(subb,get_sub(*mess_b));                <---- Added line
#endif                                            <---- Added line

    diff = strucmp(suba, subb);

    if(diff == 0) mdiff = *mess_a - *mess_b;
    /* convert to int */
    res = diff != 0 ? diff :
           mdiff != 0L ? (mdiff > 0L ? 1 : -1) : 0;
    return(mn_get_revsort(ps_global->msgmap) ? -res : res);
}


Here, for the DOS version, we #if out the declarations of suba and subb
so the static buffers are used and also set it up that the values
returned by get_sub are copied into them.  We use the static buffers
since get_sub would return a pointer to the same static buffer
(subcache->buf) when called, and this made the comparison useless
since it was always comparing the string to itself.  This does not
occur under UNIX and MS-Windows since the get_sub would return unique
pointers with each call.



The next set of changes are applied to get_sub.

char *
get_sub(mess)
     long mess;
{
    ENVELOPE *e;
    char *s, *s3, **ss;
#if defined(DOS) && !defined(_WINDOWS)                <---- Added line (a)
    char *extra_str;                                  <---- Added line
#endif                                                <---- Added line
    int   l;

#if defined(DOS) && !defined(_WINDOWS)                <---- Added line (b)
    if(!*(*(ss = subject_cache_ent(mess)))){          <---- Added line 
#else                                                 <---- Added line
    if(!*(ss = subject_cache_ent(mess))){
#endif                                                <---- Added line
        e = mail_fetchstructure(ps_global->mail_stream, mess, NULL);
        if(e && e->subject) {
            /* ---- Clean junk off the front of the subject ----*/
            for(s = e->subject; *s && (isspace(*s) || *s == '['); s++)
              ;

            if((*s == 'R' || *s == 'r') && (*(s+1) == 'E' || *(s+1) == 'e')
               && (*(s+2) == ':' || *(s+2) == '[')){
                s += 3;
                if(*(s+2) == '['){
                    while(*s && *s != ':')
                      s++;

                    s++;
                }
            }

            while(*s && (isspace(*s) || *s == '['))
              s++;

#if defined(DOS) && !defined(_WINDOWS)                   <---- Added line (c)
            if(*(extra_str = cpystr(s))){                <---- Added line
                strcpy(*ss,extra_str);                   <---- Added line

                /*----- Now, truncate junk off the back end of the subject---*/
                for(s3 = NULL, s = *ss; *s; s++)        /* blast ws and ']' */
                  s3 = (!isspace(*s) && *s != ']') ? NULL : (!s3) ? s : s3;

                if(s3)
                  *s3 = '\0';

                if((l=(s3 ? s3 : s)-(*ss)) > 5 && !strucmp((*ss)+l-5,"(fwd)"))
                  (*ss)[l-5] = '\0';

                for(s3 = NULL, s = *ss; *s; s++)        /* blast ws and ']' */
                  s3 = (!isspace(*s) && *s != ']') ? NULL : (!s3) ? s : s3;

                if(s3)
                  *s3 = '\0';
            }
        }
        else {
#if defined(DOS) && !defined(_WINDOWS)                    <---- Added line (d)
          *ss[0] = '\0';                                  <---- Added line
#else                                                     <---- Added line
          *ss = cpystr("");
#endif                                                    <---- Added line
        }

        dprint(9, (debugfile, "SUB-GET-%s-GET-SUB\n", *ss))
    }
    else{
        dprint(9, (debugfile, "SUB-HIT-%s-HIT-SUB\n", *ss))
    }

#ifndef DOS
    if(fetched_map != NULL && !GET_FETCHED_MAP(mess)) {
        SET_FETCHED_MAP(mess);
        fetched_count++;
    }
#endif
    return(*ss);
}



In added lines group (a) the variable extra_str is added for the DOS
version.  It is used in section (c) to hold an allocated string.

In group (b) we have the DOS version check to see if we have an empty
string.  We can't do like the UNIX and MS-Windows version and check for
a NULL pointer since subject_cache_ent is always returning
subcache->buf which was allocated when sorting was being initialized.

In group (c) we use extra_str to hold the pointer returned by cpystr.
Which is then copied back to our static buffer ss (subcache->buf) so we
can release extra_str.  This plugs a memory leak.

In the UNIX and MS-Windows version *ss would point to a slot in an
array of pointers, and when clear_subject_cache is called, the strings
allocated in get_sub by cpystr would be freed.  But with the DOS
version the value returned by get_sub is not tracked after
compare_subjects and becomes lost memory.

In section (d) we have the DOS version set our static buffer to an
empty string, instead of allocating another empty sting to join the
other pieces of lost memory.




The next change is a minor one that occurs in sort_current_folder.
Since it is only a small change I will not quote the entire function.

This is the original code:

    if(so != SortArrival){
        if (so == SortSubject || SortSubject2)           /* nmsgs cuz MN_EXLD */
          init_subject_cache(ps_global->mail_stream->nmsgs);

This is the corrected code:

    if(so != SortArrival){
        if ((so == SortSubject) || (so == SortSubject2)) /* nmsgs cuz MN_EXLD */
          init_subject_cache(ps_global->mail_stream->nmsgs);

SortSubject and SortSubject2 are values in an enumerated type.  I.e.,
they have constant values.  Thus the original statement would alway
evaluate to true.  This didn't cause any harm, since
clear_subject_cache would clean up after it later in the function.




And finally, the last set of changes.  These are in subject_cache_ent.

char **
subject_cache_ent(n)
    long n;
{
#if     defined(DOS) && !defined(_WINDOWS)
    fseek(subcache->ent, (subcache->cur * SUB_CACHE_LEN), 0); <---- Changed line
    fwrite((void *)subcache->buf, (size_t)SUB_CACHE_LEN, (size_t)1,
           subcache->ent);
    subcache->cur = n;
    fseek(subcache->ent, (subcache->cur * SUB_CACHE_LEN), 0); <---- Changed line
    fread((void *)subcache->buf,(size_t)SUB_CACHE_LEN,(size_t)1,subcache->ent);
    return(&(subcache->buf));
#else
    return(&subcache->ent[n]);
#endif
}


In the original code, both of the fseek statements read like this:

    fseek(subcache->ent, subcache->cur, 0);

subcache->cur is the message number to find the subject for.  So
instead of going to the position in the disk file where the subject
started, it went to a byte offset near the beginning of the file.
subcache->cur has to be multiplied by the size of the subject buffer in
order to get the correct offset in the file.



Whew!  That's it.

I posted this to the netnews group and then began to wonder if it auto

I know that listserv posts to the netnews group but, does the 
netnews group post to the listserv?

Is it possible to have pine drop all newsgroups postings that I make into
one outbox, say like OUTBOX-News (where this message will go (manually))?

I am using the selective FCC for messages to certain people/lists, but 
I've not seen anything for the newsgroups as a whole.  Is it possible?

Cheers!!!

Subject: IMAP folders on the command line?
Date: 21 Sep 1994 17:21:03 -0400
Message-Id: <35q83v$iul@angel.cs.unc.edu>

Is there a method whereby one may open an IMAP session from the
command line, without opening one's local inbox first?

For example, if I have the following in my .pinerc:

incoming-folders=sunsite{sunsite.unc.edu}inbox

I would like to be able to do something like:

pine -f sunsite

to open my Sunsite mail without bothering with opening my local inbox.

Is there any way to accomplish this, and if not, wouldn't it be a good
idea?

Trey

David Miller mentioned earlier about a program called ansiprt to print over telent
connections.  This may be dumb, but what do I do with ansiprt?  The print to ansi 
printer now works great via modem, but doesn't work with my telnet sessions.  Did
I understand right that ansiprt will allow pine to print to a pc printer over telnet?
If so, how do I use it.

Not only fine but one barrier less to finally start reading news. Most 
terminal-based newsreaders are still to cryptic for many new users (IMHO). 
Pine might help them a bit.

Check the References in this reply (sorry, Follow-Up ;-) There should be

Yeah, try Zync from Z-Code Software.

there is also a directory of pop servers at the same level.

The "ansiprt" program works because some terminal emulators support a
method of turning on an auxilliary printer and sending the incoming
data to it.  Telnet has nothing to do with it.  BTW, Pine does its
attached-to-ansi printing in the same way.  Basically, you get it to
work by doing something like this:

ansiprt < file-that-I-want-to-print

    The pound symbol may be code ALT-156 on a PC numeric keypad,
but in the ISO_8859-1 character set used for western European languages
the pound sterling character occupies position 163 decimal.
    In order to make use of 8-bit characters in messages, your environment
must be set up properly.  If you have the ISO-8859-1 charset set in the
Pine configuration screen, then you should be able to compose mail with
those characters with bit 8 set.
    Note that the ISO-8859-1 charset, which is recommended for use with
MIME mail for western European languages, is different from the PC code
page, which it sounds like will be appearing on your screen.  (I'm not
sure if you're using PC-Pine or using a PC as terminal emulator with
Unix Pine, or what...)
    There are no special ways of generating 8-bit characters from Pine
or Pico without using a keyboard which generates the 8-bit characters
itself.  But it will work if it is set up properly.  (At least not yet.
I just took a look at the source code -- fun vacation I'm on, eh? -- and
now I'm contemplating hacking the ttyin code so it will emulate the
standard Czech and Slovak keyboards.  Anyone from those countries with
interest in the results of this is urged to contact me.)  A way you can
enter the non-ASCII (or 8-bit; ASCII only covers those characters up to
decimal 127) characters from a normal keyboard I use is using Emacs as
the alternate editor with standard-display-european and
M-x insert-(whatever-character-you-wish).

    There may be other peculiarities in your setup which make it
difficult to use 8-bit characters, but the problem is not within either
Pine or Pico, but somewhere on your end, since when properly configured,
Pine has no difficulty accepting the pound sterling as character 163
(decimal) from a keyboard.

Hi folks...this is probably a dumb one, but how do you use the
"default-composer-headers" thing.  When i go into setup, config and then
put "To:", it will say:

        [No default-composer-hdrs matched, displaying defaults]

why is it doing this?

thanx.

Did you try placing a world-readable file called ".forward" in your home 
directory with the single line being the place you want your mail forwarded?
e.g.

  (On connected.com)

	$ cat ~/.forward
	oakley@pylon.com
	$

This should cause ALL mail for your account on connected to be forwarded 
to your account on pylon.  That is, of course, assuming connected is a 
Unix machine (you didn't say...)

Thanks

Mike

	As the old saying goes, "Hay, is for horses".  

	Without know anything of your environment, it would seem you
need nothing more than a .forward file in your home directory on
connected.com to redirect your email to pylon.com

Drop the ':' and it will work.  Pine 3.91 will allow, but not require, 
the ':'.

	Well, that is because "incoming-folder" is not meant to do the
function you describe.  You need to get a "filter" program such as
"procmail", "deliver" or "filter (from the elm distribution".

In 3.90 settings configuration, I'm having trouble making Pine understand
I want the read-messages folder's name to be ~/mail/read-messages. If I
put that in the read-messages line in Settings, Pine always exits with a
Bug Detected and a core dump. I had auto-move-read-msgs set to Yes when
this took place. Would someone please send me an example of a correct

Message-Id: <35s51c$ris@marr.ecs.soton.ac.uk>

Hi,

I have pine 3.89, and have it compiled and running on Linux.

However, my default "To:" line when I send to someone at my site is
expanded to user@host.mydomain when I hit RETURN on the compose screen,
while ideally I want just user@mydomain, to hide the host name and thus 
have the same domain-wide address used for anyone who later (group) 
replies to that mail.

I set "user-domain" to be mydomain in my system pine.conf, and that works
fine for setting my own "From:" line to be me@mydomain, but it doesn't 
affect the "To:" line.

I'd much rather have this happen at the pine level than kludge the
transport agent itself; I'd rather the person using pine saw just the
usual site-wide domain name than the name with the hostname tacked on.

If anyone understands what I'm on about and knows if there's some magic
variable to set to get hidden hosts then please let me know :)

Thanks,
Tim

VMS and I'm sure there are. Where can I find the missing files?

A colleague wants to use Pine, but she has no control key on her
keyboard, a MacPlus.  Is there a work around, some code, that would
send the same signal as the control+X for example required to 
send mail?

I am very pleased with pine v3.90.  However when I try to post to a
newsgroup I get the following error 

"error posting message: 441 article posted in the future ...." 

Posting to newsgroups via TIN  is working OK, so my NNTP connection is 
up and running.

Any help would be appreciated !

I don't know about pico, but in general the ansi local printer
commands are:

PRINTER  SCREEN   Character sequence
  ON       ON     27 91 63 53 105  
  ON      OFF     27 91    53 105
 OFF       ON     27 91 63 52 105
 OFF      OFF     27 91    52 105

The numbers are ascii character codes, the correspondences are
27  Escape character
91  [
63  ?
53  5
52  4
105 i

Also, "screen off" refers to what happens while printing is occurring.
You don't blank out everything by leaving out the question mark when
turning off the printer.

If you change the order in which Pine lists your messages, it will put 
the cursor at the very top, or the lastest received message. To do this, 
type in "$", and choose the reverse option "r".

    All control keys can be typed as ESC-ESC-(letter-key).
That is, hit the ESC key twice, then the letter key which one would
be normally used with the control key.
    I've found this very useful, since while I can type such commands
as ^_ and ^C and ^X, for some reason with this system the ^^ does not
generate any character, or else it is caught somewhere, so if I want
to mark text, I must use ESC-ESC-^ .  It's nice to have a backup.
(And every day I use a different system with different peculiarities...)

The problem was solved by changing the Edit/Preferences setting
in Telnet 2.45.  "Option key mapped to control" should be UNchecked,
and then the option key functions like a control key.

Subject: Does pine care about TERMINFO env. var.
Message-Id: <CwJF5D.Juv@cc.umontreal.ca>
Date: Thu, 22 Sep 1994 15:31:58 GMT


I use pine on a VT-220 compatible terminal. I'm on a SysV Unix system.

Since I don't like `reverse video' messages, I create a new definition of
the vt220 `terminfo' (I called it vt221). I put the definition (with tic) in
~/Term/v/vt221 and set the TERMINFO environment variable to that directory
(~/Term). I also set the TERM env. var. to vt221.

This works fine with other programs, but not with pine. I changed the
`rev' attribute of the definition.

Does pine cares about TERMINFO?
What field does it use to start the reverse video?

Thanks for any information.

We would like to use PC-Pine and therefore have to run the imapd server on

Can't imapd co-operate with pop using the same inbox?

Any solutions/ideas to correct this problem?

My appologies if this is a FAQ, or I'm missing something obvious, but
my loginid is different on my workstation, and my IMAP server.  Is there
a way to configure PINE on my workstation so that it uses an ID that
I specify, for connecting to the server and for the From: line of

Message-Id: <35t3pn$3bq@universe.digex.net>

Howdy,

I've got myself a little problem and I'm hoping someone else has seen it
and can help me figure things out:  I fired up pine 3.90 (I've been going
back and forth between elm and pine) and it gave a message to the effect
of ``converting elm aliases to addressbook format''.  (I was sitting there
thinking uh oh...)

(1) Is there any way to turn off this feature?

(2) Apparently my elm aliases.text file is too complicated for the filter,
and my old .addressbook file is now hosed.  Bummer.  I tried pulling the
conversion script off the www site so that I could create a new one from
the elm aliases.text file, but it is too naive to do the job.  Is there a
better one out there? 

cheers,
john

Since I moved from Linux to HP-UX, I have been getting messages 
with an unparsable date error.  Can anyone enlighten me as to why,
and better, how to fix it?

Thanks for your time, Daniel Grahek

If this is in a faq, please excuse me, just direct me to a fac.  I'm 
wondering whether I can have a unix host as a dedicated mail server for 
unix pine and pc-pine mail clients.  I'd like the inbox on the mail 
server and all the other folders on their home machines -- at least in 
the unix case.  I'd like to have the mail server setup so that users 
cannot telnet, rsh, ftp, rlogin, etc to it.... Another words, I want 
this unix machine to be accessbile only by imap clients. 

Is this possible? feasible? I'm estimating 500 - 1000 e-mail accounts to 
start.

Can anyone explain why PINE would be VERY SLOW at its initial attempt to 
open INBOX?  I don't recall having this problem several months ago, but 
for the last 3-4 weeks, it has been taking 20-30 seconds to initialize 
the main menu.

I have very little stuff in my home directory, about 6 mail folders 
(mostly empty), and rarely more than 4-5 entries in my mailbox.

It should work without any difficulty.  Could you send a sample INBOX=20

	As for procmail....

A recent version can be picked up at various comp.sources.misc archives.
The latest version can be obtained directly from the ftp-archive at:

        ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (137.226.225.3)

as (g)zipped tar file:     /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz       
as compressed tar file:    /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.Z        


	For the other....best to consult "archie"....

I have the same problem with the same OS (seen at 2400 baud).
The suggested fix to ttyin.c does not change anything....

Go to the config setup off of the main menu (MCS), scroll down to the 
sortkey setting, and set it to OrdrdSubj.

Works pretty well.  My only gripe is that I'd like to be able to set 
sortkey SEPARATELY for news folders and for mail folders (if any of the 
pine development team is listening!)

This is odd.  Could you mv the old pine3.90/pine/ttyin.c file to something
like pine3.90/pine/ttyin.c.orig, and put the attached ttyin.c file in its
place?  After rebuilding, ^Q/^S should work the old pre-3.90 way...

Michael...Thanks, it appears to work like a charm for us as well.

Pine Team...please note that this HPUX problem also occurred on DG/UX 
5.4.201 with a user accessing the system via DataPac. This fiddling with 
the ttyin.c file has solved the ^Q/^S problem on our system as well. 
Hopefully it won't cause any others.

Ms. Feingold,

Pine 3.90 has an OrderedSubject sort that we call "poor man's threading", but
not real threads.  We will probably implement "real" threading in a future
release...

That is exactly the way we have it setup on one of our major clusters (30000
or so accounts).  We also have it setup so that each user can have multiple
folders on the mail server, addressing them as user+folder@u.washington.edu.

Well, it threads about as effectively as tin does (IMHO), as long as you 
use SortKey=OrderedSubject in the setupo menu!

Where do I put this script so Pine can take advantage of PGP?  I've searched
the help file, but it says nothing about scripts...

Thanks to those who replied by mail, I have now fixed the problem.
If curious, the problem was Linux slakware had constructed my local
hosts file in a way I hadn't expected, as Michael Covington told me:

 In your /etc/hosts file, just reverse the way it reads now....
 Make it read:
 <ip-address>    host-name-alone         full-host-name

Cheers,
Tim

Yes, imapd and pop should cooperate.

There is definitely something wrong on your system.

It sounds like something is wrong with the format of the mailbox.  What
version of imapd are you running (are you using the version that came with
PC-Pine 3.90)?  Can you send us a copy of a mailbox which exhibits this=20
problem?

Gee, around here, that would be viewed as a feature! :)  One of my
local FAQs for trn readers who are tired of seeing
alt.sex.newbie.aol.whatever is to tell them about trn -q to turn that
feature off! :) 

All kidding aside, I've been reading in this group for a day or two and
am quite impressed with the helpfulness and spirit of cooperation
displayed here.

I enjoyed the thread about pine vs. elm.  My 2 cents: here we decided
that we would support (e.g., offer tutorials and classes) one mail
package in addition to /usr/ucb/mail--pine won the sweepstakes because
of its ease of use.  All recognized that pine 3.0X had fewer
features than the then current versions of elm, mh, mush, etc.  But the
need to get an easier to use mail program for the bulk of our users won
out.  (Our committee echoed the sentiment one of you stated so
well: "I prefer elm; my users prefer pine

I hope that pine can continue to be as easy to use as in the past, even
as new features get added!  To me, being able to show a tenured faculty
member (or a hormone-laden freshperson) how to use pine in 5-10 minutes
and then getting the next question via e-mail makes support much more
rewarding than spending 20-30 minutes with them and then getting a
question over the 'phone!  With pine, they have learned how to at least
get started communicating with others.  Some migrate to other packages,
but most stay put in pine.

I'll close my rambling with one amusing (well, to me) anecdote:
we had a librarian who somehow created a file that ls listed as

 -

He tried the rm - - command I had told him about; he tried
quotes, he tried apostrophes, he tried wildcards--in short, he
tried everything that had worked under the PREVIOUS version of
SunOS (I later learned about the -- flag replacing the -
flag....).  One of my consultants asked him if he had tried using
pine to delete the file.  That's what he managed to figure out
how to do.... (From the Main menu: C ^r ^t <arrows> D).

Best wishes to all,
Richard

p.s. We are just getting ready to replace 3.89 with 3.90....

PINE_BETA_9 is the latest version which is based on Pine-3.89. I am now working
on the 3.90 version.
  In order to FTP the above saveset (you can also get the .ZIP one from there)
do:
$ FTP PINE_BETA_9.BCK into TEST.BCK
$ BACKUP some-small-file  PINE.BCK/SAVE
$ COPY/REPLACE TEST.BCK PINE.BCK

and see whether you can read PINE.BCK; if it fails then repeat the two last
steps, but use COPY/OVERLAY.

Well, looking at my convenient .pinerc here on my SCO box, I can tell you 
that my news-collections is empty, and instead I have nntp-host set to my 
local host name.  This is with Pine 3.90.  Setting the nntp-host turned

I have installed PC-Pine 3.9 on a machine running PC-NFS 5.
Pine can never resolve the host name of the server even if
I use the IP number itself. Machines running PC-Pine with 
packet drivers successfully access the same server so it's
narrowed down to the PC-NFS interaction. Any ideas? Thanks.

I attempted to install Pine 3.90 on my Linux system with 40 megs of
ram and had about 3 users running it when memory swapping went haywire.
It seems the news features are worse then tin when it comes to memory 
use.  Has anyone else had memory use problems with pine 3.90?

Hello all,

Can anyone tell me if there is an off-line reader/ composer for pine? I 
have a dial-in connection from my PC to the Unix box at school, and I 
would like to be able to conserve modem time. Any help out there?

Thanks a lot!

Subject: Ansiprt, WinComm, & HP LaserJet 4M Postscript Printer
Date: 23 Sep 1994 17:14:19 GMT
Message-Id: <35v2db$gt7@news.halcyon.com>

Hello All,

I'm having problems printing *directly* from a Unix host to my printer,
an HP Laserjet 4M Postscript printer, while using Windows comm software.  
When I use DOS Kermit I'm able to do all the things I'd like to do, i.e.:

[1] Use Pine's Y command to print an ascii email message/news article.
[2] Use ansiprt or ansiprint to send an ascii file to my printer.
[3] Use ansiprt or ansiprint to send a postscript file to my printer.

With WinComm I've had all kinds of problems.  I finally figured out
that in order to print ascii files ([1] and [2] above) I need to
change the print driver from "HP Laserjet 4/4M Postscript" to
"HP Laserjet 4/4M."  When I have the driver set to "HP Laserjet
4/4M Postscript" I get a page with errors that usually starts with:

Offending Command=Date:
Error=nametype:undefined
	this name is not defined in a dictionary
Stack=

I haven't figured out how to send postscript files directly to my 
printer.  Actually I did get it to work once but then the next
postscript file I sent failed.  Here's a typical error message
I get when trying to send a postscript file (e.g., with
"cat filename |ansiprint"):

Offending Command=translte
Error=nametype:undefined
	this name is not defined in a dictionary
Stack=
	0
	-59500

On the printer I've got "PERSONALITY" set to "AUTO*" which 
according to the manual:

  Under AUTO, the printer analyzes the stream of data being sent   
  to determine which language is being used by the print job, and
  the printer's personality will "automatically" be switched to
  that language.


The reason I have hope is that I'm able to do these things with no 
problem using DOS Kermit.  If anyone has any suggestions for how to 
do 1, 2, and 3 from WinComm (or any Windows comm program) please let 
me know.  

Thanks much,
Nancy

  Sorry for the stupidity, folks; I HAVE read the Pine FAQ, and "man

  I currently use Pine 3.89, and would like to install Pine 3.90, but 
can't find instructions for doing this.

  Thanks in advance for knowledgeable help.

Message-Id: <YiVRAT200WBOQ3mkVh@andrew.cmu.edu>

I keep getting the error "Can't send message without an open remote
folder" from the main menu when I try to compose, and "pine user@host"
just gives me back a DOS prompt.

I've tried fiddling with all of the config options that looked
applicable, but I couldn't get it to work.  

How can I send a message without an open remote folder?  I just want to
be able to compose from my PC - I don't even want to open an inbox, so I
give it a bogus one on my PC (I don't *have* a remote one Pine can use).
 I was able to do this with 3.89.  Note: I *can* send mail if I open a
remote folder.

I hope there's a better answer than "get the old version". :)
Thanks,
Chris

Date: 23 Sep 1994 22:52:53 GMT
Message-Id: <35vm85$2lf@Emerald.tufts.edu>

Hello--

I've built and installed pine 3.90 on two OSF/1 systems. Both are 
DEC Alpha 3000/800s. One is running OSF 1.3 while the other is 
running OSF 3.0. On both, pine was built using DEC C 3.11 with
the default settings for osf.

The problem is that sometimes (not always), pressing a menu button
(hitting 'I' at the main menu for example) or paging through a
message yields a bunch of "Unaligned access ... blah blah" errors
and screws up the display. There were no warnings that I remember
during the compilation, so I don't know where to begin looking.

Has anybody else seen this kind of problem? I can't give a more 
verbose description of the error message now because I can't get 
it to happen at the moment.

Thanks for any info,
jonathan

Ray,
Pine is emphatically *not* in the public domain, but it *is* freely 
available.  You can get it via anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu
in the /pine directory.  The entire distribution is in /pine/pine.tar.Z
and there are also some pre-compiled binaries in the /pine/unix-bin

Is there a way to make it say something like:

  "On Sept 7, alien lifeform resembling Joe Doe wrote:"

I know that you can edit that line in the editor, but I was wondering if 
it can be set to a default so it will appear there everytime.  I'm using 
version 3.89.

Subject: Pine3.90a on BSDI
Date: 26 Sep 1994 08:23:55 GMT
Message-Id: <3660er$e3m@nuhou.aloha.net>

I compiled PINE 3.90a using the build BSI option on BSDI 1.1
To get it to compile I had to make the following change:

~/pine390/pine3.90/pico diff efunc.h efunc.h~
207c207
< extern        int sstrcasecmp(void *, void *);
---
> extern        int sstrcasecmp(const void *, const void *);

This may not be the best way to fix it but it worked.
This is the only change to any of the files I made.
(other than applying the 3.90a address book patches)

Also I noticed that if I invoke pine like this:

	pine -d 0 -p xxx -P xxx

When I exit, Pine seems to go into a infinite loop.
If I take out the -d 0, then all works fine.

Pine 3.90 is great, I really like some of the new features.

There are a number of filter programs available. OFten discussed as used 
with elm is a program called simply filter that allows just this sort of 
thing. You will have to write no scripts. To see if you have it on your 
system, just type which filter and hit return. If so, read the man pages 
or seek further assitance. Hope this helps

It used to be the case that while reading mail in 2.89 the system would 
get busy for several seconds, during which time, the upper left Header 
line would display two asterisks - as I recall. When my keyboard seems 
unresponsive it gave a visual cue for the time out interval. I don't see 
this que in 3.90.  Has it been dropped from the code, or is this a 
problem specific to my HPUX environment.

Subject: [Q] Building pine 3.90 on BSD/386
Date: 24 Sep 1994 14:46:47 -0701
Message-Id: <3626oo$abo@freenet.unbc.edu>


Has anyone been able to successfully build pine 3.90 on BSD/386?

I run a 'build bsi' and most of the compilations work, but I get a problem.

The function sstrcasecmp in osdep.c doesn't compile for pico and this just
causes additional problems further down.


If anyone has a patch, I'd appreciate it emailed or posted.  Thanks.

: One question, though... how do you *post* to newsgroups using pine?

Step 1, get pine 3.90.  Pine 3.90 has an additional header, available by 
request in normal message creation, and by default when composing a 
message while reading a newsgroup, called something to the effect of 
"Newsgroups:", which, when filled in, causes the message to be posted to 
a newsgroup, in addition to being mailed to any addresses in the "To:", 
"CC:", or "BCC:" headers.

Just put the script somewhere in the path so that Pine can find it.. and 
set up your Alternate Editor to call this script.  So when your composing 
a message just press ^_ and off you go.

Does pine have the ability to 'Take an Address' to your Distribution List 
or can you Cut and Paste the data from your '.addressbook' file inside 
Pine to accomplish the same thing?

Thanks in advance

[ Article crossposted from alt.clearing.technology ]
[ Author was Homer Wilson Smith ]
[ Posted on Mon, 26 Sep 1994 03:32:10 -0400 ]

     There is a new version of Pine 3.90 that many of you will
be using soon if you are not already.

     This version has some serious changes from previous versions, some
of which are security risks to users of the older version.

     The recent failure to keep private mail private that went down
between Tony and Enid happened like this.

     Enid made a public posting to a.c.t.

     Tony responded by 'reply' private mail to Enid.

     Enid, using the new Pine 3.90, hit Reply to answer by private mail.
Pine presented a NEW prompt which asked if Enid wanted the answer to go to
the public newsgroup.  This was confusing as never before has a mailer
been able to do this, post private mail to a public news group.  Enid
answered yes automatically probably thinking it meant reply to all
recipients which is what is usually meant, OR thinking that the posting
must have been public from the beginning since it was asking about the
newsgroup in the first place, and the file went to a.c.t., rather than
Tony by private mail.

     Yer all gonna get burned by this one, so watch out.  The problem
is you will get burned by the OTHER guy who is answering your private
mail, that you sent from tin or rn or some such.

     So if you want mail to remain private SAY SO.

     Homer

I tend to agree with the poster that this new functionality has a
tendency to produce the undesireable result of making a private mail
public by accident especially to the uninitiated for which this
product is intended.

I was inundated with a set of these recently when many people
responded to a news posting I made and I found it disconcerting to
have to take action to stop the reply being posted to the newsgroup.

Perhaps a rewording of the question and changing it to a default that
results in no posting might be appropriate?

	Can [N] and [P] in the folder index skip over deleted messages ? 
Or can we have an option in the config for it ? 

	I expunge very infrequently and would prefer not to have to 
rummage around lots of deleted messages...

Hi netters,

I am in the process of setting PC-PINE 3.89 to run on a Novell net connecting
to out Unix server. This problem may be a FAQ but I could not find the
answer to it. Please let me know where I can find the answers.

What I need is a single copy of PINERC for all users. I have successfully set up
PINERC so that users will be asked to log on everytime they run PINE. However
I can't seems to get PINE to use the log in name in the "From:" field
in a compose message. PC-PINE will ask for one if I have it blanked in the
config. Doesn't this make it easy to send fake mails?

Any solutions will be welcomed. I appreciate if you can answer by E-mail.

thanks very much in advance.

And I as well. Same symptoms. All other apps work fine with the IMAP server
and SMTP. I'm using MS TCP/IP stack (and have also tried Trumpet beta 15).

My bet is that "DataPac" is using Xon/Xoff flow control.

I know that pine 3.9 has that option in the Configure section of it

        I'm trying to configure Pine v3.89 to direct copies of outgoing
mail to a remote machine.  the manual suggests changing .pinerc to include
the following line: 

default-fcc={domain}path; e.g. {netcom.com}/usr/mail/sent-mail.

        I have two questions, first, can fcc have two files, a local and a
remote? second, on the remote, I'm not exactly certain of the proper
syntax and would like some guidance.  E.g., my dial-up account is
gbgf@netcom.com and my files reside under /usr/gbgf/..., what would the
proper fcc line be in .pinerc on another machine for my other account, to
forward copies of sent mail to the netcom account? 

        thanks for any assistance.

This is for Pine 3.89

When I'm reading new mail and I hit 'd' it deletes my current message and 
goes on to the next.  Sometimes I don't want to read the next message yet
(and I want to leave it as new).  I find I can hit 'i' first then 'd' and 
then I don't have to read the next message.

I also see that there is a setting that causes me to move to the next 
non-deleted message (instead of just the next message).  Is there an option
to stay on the current message on a delete instead of going to the next?

This is so trivial, I wouldn't even think of asking for one if it doesn't
exist already, but I would probably use it if it did exist.

I use pine 3.90. When I try to paste text from a windows app to pine (via

Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?

That's a pretty simple answer.  One of my users had the same problem, and
I finally got it myself.  It doesn't happen with pine 3.07, so 
something's changed with pine.  Any clues?  We're just using any terminal 
emulator dialing into a 7-bit even parity line.  It's true, that it's got 
to have something to do with flow control, but why is pine seeing it in 
3.9, and didn't in 3.07?

CB,
This is a flat-out bug.  Apparently Pine 3.90 occassionally gets confused
and thinks a message should be posted when it shouldn't.  The way it is
supposed to work is that *if and only if* the newsgroups header is filled
in, will Pine attempt to post. 

"We're working on it."

One solution that was posed, and seems to work, is the removal of a 
couple of lines from the ttyin.c file. These lines have to do with 
ignoring ^Q/^S, but don't *seem* to work. Removing them solves that problem.

I don't know why 3.90 is reacting the way it is. Hopefully the Pine Team 
(or someone else who knows the code) would be able to explain this better.

My original follow-up (suggesting that the question should be inverted) was
based on the functionality when working correctly. That is, that posting
should default to "no" even if there is a newsgroup header as a number of
newsreader/mailer combos seem to be putting the Newsgroup header in
automatically as part of a private reply to a newsposting.

Is there any possibility of this being considered?

Message-Id: <368g3f$ds5@garuda.csulb.edu>

I can no longer (still using PINE 3.88 here) make the Control-^ key work 
to block text that can then be Killed by ^K (rather than doing it a line 
at a time). When I do it line by line, PINE (and PICO) responds with "You 
can block the text with Ctrl-^ and then Kill", but it doesn't work. I 
used to be able to do this, but don't know what's different now.
Anyone know what's up? I'm using VT100 emulation (as always) with our 
system PINE on Unix mainframe.
Thanks... Chuck

I think the following patch will fix at least one cause of the loop (the read
part). If we read 0 bytes from a terminal it means that that the terminal is
no longer there. I've just installed this patch so we'll see what happens :-)

I have pine compiled on a unix box and want to access my vms mail on out vms

the client seems ok but I cannot seem to read any mail, I can connect to the
server with pine and login, but I allways get the folder opened with
0 messages. Can some one explain again the syntax for IMAP mail boxes with
pine ?

 i have a mac plus at home and have no problem with using the 'cloverleaf'
 key instead of Ctrl.  the only problem i have had is trying to switch to
 vi by typing ^_.  on my plus, i've had to type ^(shift) underscore key.

 otherwise, no probs.  let me know if i can be of further help.

I create documents on a PC in MicroSoft Word and need to upload them

anyone know the most effective way of doing this.

Here's the problem...I've been able to successfully upload the articles
using ProComm Plus and include them in my mail, but the person on the
other end receives my document with all kinds of weird line wrapping,
making it virtually unreadable.  I've tried uuencoding the document 
online before I send it, but that doesn't seem to work either.

Any helpful, step by step instructions would be most appreciated!

	What I've done is use pkzip to create a zipfile. Upload the 
zipfile to your home directory, then send e-mail with the zipfile as an 
attachment.  I've had no problems (sending or receiving) files, although 
I use Wordperfect (it shouldn't make any difference).  No need to 
uuencode with this method.

This may be obvious to some of you, but I'm still getting used 
to some of the new features in Pine, and discovering some of the
(to me) non obvious tricks, so I'll share a couple of them: 


To reply and include text from several messages in one post: 

  SELECT the messages. Then APPLY REPLY to the messages. 
  This will allow you to include all of the selected messages in
  your reply. 


To select a subset of already selected messages when there's not
an obvious selection criteria for the ones you want:

  You can step thru and unselect current on the messages you 
  don't want, but when there are more you DON'T want than the
  ones you do want to include, this is tedious. Instead, pick
  them manually and flag them important, and then select by flag.

in your pinerc file, try this

folder-collections=vms {vmssystem-fqdn}[]

for a mail file other than the default, use

folder-collections=vms {fqdn}#device:<directory>filename.mai#[]

if your device contains a $ sign, then you should define an env. variable 
in DOS say diskname and use {fqdn}#$diskname:<directory>filename.mai#[]

and have diskname contain the $2$dka200 type of notation.

you can do this for your inbox-path= also in your pinerc file.

I believe most of the help info is compiled into the program, 
however, if you create a "/usr/local/lib/pine.info" file, it 
will be displayed in the "local" part of the help file. Typically,
you would put contact info for the local maintainer/installer, etc. 

I looked into this and asked some questions earlier: what I would
like is a way to distribute user notices ( like, for example, to
pre-advise them that I'm about to install a new version of Pine, and
how to run the old version if they discover any problems, etc. ) 

You can modify the new-user message that they will get the first time
they change versions, but this requires modifying the source and
recompiling. 

I suppose I could create a shared mailbox, and set the global config
file to check that mailbox for newmail. How do flags like NEW or 
DELETED work in a shared mailbox. I assume it has to be an IMAP 
mailbox for this to work. Does that mean it has to be specified 
with {host}, even if it's local, or does c-client use IMAP access
by default ? 

Has anyone tried this sort of thing ?

I got "hit" by the same thing just the other day.  I had a mail message 
in my INBOX and when I replied to it I got the "newsgroup" question.  I 
had assumed that the sender had also included the newsgroup when sending 
to me so I said OK, post to the newsgroup.  Well, he wasn't to pleased 
that I had posted a reply to what he considered a "private" to the newsgroup.

I think the problem is that some mailers, when sending private replies, 
include the Newsgroups: header in the mail heaers.  I guess this is to 
indicate which newsgroups it originated ... ??  Pine is picking up on 
that and assuming that it might want to go back to those newsgroups.

If you tell Pine "NO" then it all works as desired.  Live and learn ...

You need to Delete an article if you want to show that you have read it. 
Pine will then update the .newsrc file.  This is different from
conventional newsreaders.

How about a modification to the Zoom command which would let me hide
deleted messages? (or selected messages, or messages From my boss ;-)

Also, could Deleting (or expunging) move messages to a "trash" folder?

Hi all,

I've noticed some messages on this group about the windows version of 
PC-PINE not working with certain flavours of winsocket. I'm running Lan 
workplace Vsn 4.2 and although I can look at myIMAP folders o.k. whenever 
I try to send a message, the PINE process "stops communicating".
I'm running windows 3.11 on a 486/33Mhz with 8 M ram. Did somebody post a 
solution to this problem that I missed or are there still problems 
running the Windows version of PC-PINE?

He's right, the .newsrc only seems to get updated when groups are 
subscribed to/from. There are no status flags alongside any news 
articles in any newsgroups. We're using nntp for news access.

I started in January 1994 to modify the pine 3.89 sources by removing
its tty-based user interface completely and replacing it with a 
Motif 1.2 based user interface, with multiple windows, menubars, buttons,
lists etc. 

Making the Motif interface wasn't hard nor even time consuming as I used
an interface builder (the uimx 2.5 on HP9000/735). But going inside
pine code was the tough part. I really had to do a lot of work with it,
and by May 1994 I had a demo version together, which had mail reading
capabilities implemented but compose and send mail, addressbook 
updating and many minor things remained unfinished. 
I named the program as "Spruce".

I also put up a WWW server in May and made some html-documents, see: 
<a href="http://dshp02.trs.ntc.nokia.com:3000/Spruce/Spruce.html">
The server also provides a binary executable for HP9000/730 HP/UX 9.
(I might compile a Sun binary soon, as I finally got Motif kit for our Suns)

Creating Spruce was a hobby that I did on spare time, and in spring 1994
I was fortunate enough not to have any big projects at work.
Unfortunately in May 1994 I started a big R&D project with a tight
schedule and a big responsibility. This project has taken all my time
so far and seems to just grow and demand as much human resources as I
can possibly grab. Needless to say, the Spruce project has been suspended
due to this. I don't know when I'll have time to continue.

Probably I should make the Spruce sources generally available, but
I haven't had even time to make nescessary preparations (some clean up,
documentation, distribution etc...).

Another problem is the way I attacked the problem itself, changing the
user interface. As pine v. 3.90 is now out, and I have looked those
sources again, it is clear that this approach is not the way to go.
Spruce and pine would diverge into separate paths, which isn't a 
good thing in my opinion. For this reason I have hesitated in making
the Spruce code publicly available (it being based on pine 3.89 sources).

I have been thinking of other ways to approach the problem. Here's
some ideas:

1. rewrite ttyin.c and ttyout.c for X11R5 Xlib calls
   As all pine's user interface input/output is based on calls
   within these modules, one could easily rewrite these functions
   using X11- and Xt-libabry calls instead of termio/sgtty calls.
   pine would effectively become X11-application with very little work.
   Mouse support and cut/paste would require some additional work.

2. Previous approach could be enhanced by containerizing the pine
   code into a form of Xt-widget. One could then add other (Motif)
   widgets around such "xpine-Widget" to add a menu-bar etc...

Now, if there only were 20 more hours to a day...

Hi; I'm trying to get a handle on what's required for a user-domain
value to get passed to the outside world.  Suppose I change user-domain
from abc.com, my main machine, to xyz.com, a domain that I have
authority over and am running an MX record for.  The copy that goes to
sent-mail has the proper user-domain in it, but the copy that's
received at another site shows abc.com.

Is it possible to use user-domain for what I want?  What needs to be in
place for it to work?

Thanks much.

Has there been any projected release date for Pine 3.91 (the maintenance
release for 3.9)?  We are holding installation of Pine 3.90 in hopes that
Pine 3.91 will be released soon. Thanks for any information.

All Macintosh users on our campus are having the same problem getting the 
Control-^ key to work for them.  We are using MacTcp 2.04 and NCSA 
Telnet 2.6 to connect to a Sun SparcCenter 2000 in Vt100 Macintosh 
emulation.  Anyone have any ideas how to make this work?  We tested this 
using Pine 3.90.

Better yet, send each message as a separate print job (or best yet,
make it configurable - single stream, single stream w/ ^L, or multiple
print jobs).

I print mail via a postscript filter that picks up the author and subject 
and prints a header block.  While I would like to be able to tag and print
a bunch of e-mail at once, I need each to be sent as a separate print job
in order for the filter to print them properly.

Thanks.

Is there some sort of limit to the number of blind copies one can send?  
I sent out a piece of mail with 100+ blind copies and the system lopped 
off the last few names, inlcuded them in the message, and didn't send the 
message to them.

E-mail replies preferred, but I'll check the list.

I think that the ability to repost to a news group e-mail that one received
as a result of a post is very powerful and useful (even if it is a bug!).

I have often received e-mail as a result of a news posting that I have
made which I wish to reply to in the news group since the issue is one
of general interest.

I would suggest that the option to repost an e-mail reply be retained,
but that the prompt be made clearer and the default be set to NOT post
to the newsgroup.

Anyone have any thoughts on an automated way to clean up old folders 
other than a downright deletion. I've only used PINE for a few days, and 
my sent-mail folder is already huge.

Also on some systems you need to make your home directory world searchable 
so the mail transport agent can find your .forward, i.e.:


Type...                 In order to...
-------                 --------------
cd                      Go to your home directory.

pico .forward           Use the pico editor to create a .forward file.
                        (Replace "pico" with another editor if you like.)

<your new address>      

chmod 644 .forward      Make .forward world readable.

ls -l .forward          Check the permission: it should say -rw-r--r--

chmod +x .              Make home directory searchable by all.

ls -ld .                Check permission of home dir: it should say drwx?-x?-x
                        The ?'s may be r's or hyphens or one of each (i.e.,
                        drwx--x--x, drwxr-xr-x, drwxr-x--x, drwx--xr-x).

ls -la                  Check permission of files in home dir.  If any are
                        world or group writable (?????w??w?) you'll probably
                        want to change this by doing a "chmod go-w FileName".
                        For more info on changing permissions see chmod
                        man pages.
 

Hope this helps,
Nancy

I'm a new user of pine, and am impressed with it so far, but I need to 
get a manual so that I can figure out how to set the options in my 
.pinerc file (LSU's pine doesn't support the setup options method). Can 
someone let me know where to FTP or buy a manual from? Thanks.

I'm new to dealing with attached files.  When I send them to a service like 
MciMail, they need to be re-processed into their original form.  If I do this 
using Eudora, it is done automatically for me.  I want to find out what reader 
I can recommend for my friends using MciMail and other services which don't 
automatically provide email readers that can reconstitute files that have been 
attached using either the BinHex or Mime protocol.

Any Help you can give would be appreciated.

I am running Pine 3.60 under SUNOS 4.3

	Quite often I get sent postscipt files by email. In
order to print them, I save them and then cut the header off
and then print the file. Is there a way to filter the file

Well, in terms of your sent-mail folder I can suggest something. In the 
addressbook you can set each address to put mail sent to it in a specific 
folder. For example, I have folders for Pine, Majordomo, Uunet, etc. I 
also have folders called Pine-sent, Majordomo-sent, Uunet-sent for each 
of these. 

In the addressbook, select the address you wish to change. 
Press 'E' to Edit it. It will prompt you for the field you would like to 
edit, choose 'G' and enter the folder you would like to save the mail 
sent to this person in. Repeat as necessary.

Or, you can change the default Fcc: folder. In 'S'etup, 'C'onfigure, page 
down until you see fcc-name-rule. There are three choices, 
by-recipient, last-fcc-used, and default-fcc.

This won't cut down on the amount of mail saved, but it will keep it 
organized. Hope this helps.

Please make it configurable, and make the default to treat mail as private.
I can think of almost no case where it is appropriate to post back to news
something that I have received in private mail.

Well - if you could get them to send you MIME enclosed postscript,
then your mailcap file could direct it to ghostview. 

  Otherwise, you can set your personal print command in .pinerc
and/or Setup Printer menu to pipe it thru a sed/awk/perl/... command
that strips off everything before the "%!PS" 


OK: I think I *finally* found something that mush does that Pine still 
doesn't do:

 (1) mush's 'pipe' command has a '-p pattern' switch which basically
    does the above.   'pipe -p "%!PS" lpr ' 
    ( which is why I never tried to figure out exactly WHAT sed 
      command you would need! :-) 

 (2) my personal_print_command is set to 'enscript -2 -r' .
    In mush there are substitutions strings for the subject,
    from line, date, etc. of the current message. So you could
    set the header lines on your printed output with the subject
    of a particular thread, etc. 

 (3) You can also use the above to customize the index display. 
    Something else I miss in mush is that, with the exact time
    in the index as well as the sender, I'm able to easily
    pick out duplicate messages ( from mailing lists and CC-ed 
    replies, etc. ) and delete them. 


Don't know if there any way to incorporate the same functionality
into pine, but it's something for you guys to consider.

Having no status flags set on news postings seems illogical and
inconsistent to us. Surely news should behave like mail? Having to delete
as well as read a news message seems a waste of time after 3.07 where the
N flags were taken care of. Now that flags can be set/unset by the user,
I'd have thought there was more of acase for using them.

This works fine for me. If you have never ftp'ed a newer version of
Pine.exe from Innosoft.com, then you should do so anonymously. (Non-PMDF
customers need not try, because this version of Pine is linked with PMDF
and would not work without it).

Hi,

I had a user report that he attempted to enter his passwd 3 times 
unsuccessfully (due to the CAP-LOCK key) and PC-PINE sort of locked up.

I know, 'sort of locked up'?  By this I mean, you can no longer attempt to
log in(waited about 10 minutes) but selecting Options, About or Help from
the menu works.  Also, I can't find a way to close PC-Pine.  The only 
way to close pine was to exit windows.

Is this the expected behavior?

Has anyone else seen this?

I think it's software. I can print to my laser just fine using Windows 
Terminal, the old shareware Procomm for DOS, whatever, but WinComm 
agsolutely won't do it, and I get the same sequence of pointless 
questions and error messages, more or less, that Aaron does. Delrina says 
that after investigating, they can state that winComm won't accept the Y 
print command from Pine.

Most of the help text is in pine/pine.hlp, but pay special attention to the
comments/instructions in the file, as it is run through a script to generate
the source files... 

A shared mailbox can be anywhere, it does not have to use IMAP.  If the data
will be read-only to everyone but the sysadmin, set the unix file permissions
accordingly and you should be OK.  If you want shared read/write access, I
would create a Tenex format folder.  Just note that a Tenex folder should be
treated as binary, even though it looks like plain text...

Can anyone point me in the direction of:

1) what series of commands I could give to IMAP to login to a remote system

2) where in the imap code the entry and handling of the passwd is found.

Many thanks in advance.

Ian,

Is there an ftp site I can get a copy of your program I'd
love to have a look see.... Why can't the people
who write pine create an X-Interface?

: The server also provides a binary executable for HP9000/730 HP/UX 9.

: I haven't had even time to make nescessary preparations (some clean up,

: some ideas:

: 1. rewrite ttyin.c and ttyout.c for X11R5 Xlib calls
:    As all pine's user interface input/output is based on calls
:    within these modules, one could easily rewrite these functions
:    using X11- and Xt-libabry calls instead of termio/sgtty calls.
:    pine would effectively become X11-application with very little work.
:    Mouse support and cut/paste would require some additional work.

: 2. Previous approach could be enhanced by containerizing the pine
:    code into a form of Xt-widget. One could then add other (Motif)
:    widgets around such "xpine-Widget" to add a menu-bar etc...

: Now, if there only were 20 more hours to a day...

     I'd like to standardize on an IMAP MUA.  Pine is such a thingy.  
I've found it for Unix, PC's, VMS (believe it or not).  Is there a Mac 
version?  If so where do I find it?  If not, anybody doing it?

     Thanks much.

I realize this is not the right newsgroup for this, but does anyone know
if the new Eudora supports the MIME protocol?  If not, what's the best
way to send attachments when you use pine and your recipient uses Eudora 
(Mac)?

For some reason when I fired up pine 3.90 for the first time, I seem to be
subscribed to all the newsgroups listed at my site.  Is there a command or
something I can do to unsubscribe to them all..other than doing it one by one
(I don't have that kind of time on my hands).. thanks  please email..

Well, the only problem is where do you store the flags?  You can't store them
in the message like mbox format, because it is shared and read-only.  If you
use the .newsrc mechanism for compatibility with other tools, you only have
one bit per message available.  If you add an auxiliary file, it will get
out-of-sync every time someone uses another tool....

One caveat for users, and potential users, of filter.  There is a possibility
of having your folders corrupted if filter tries to deliver a message at the
same time that Pine has the folder open and is doing a checkpoint.  This is
not a common occurance, but I just had it happen to me a few days ago, so be
carefull...

Has anyone seen this before?  We ran out of home space and 
found that 4 users had .pine-debug files that were 
100Mb  (yes, 100,000,000 bytes).  This is pine v3.90 on Solaris
2.3 complied with the stupidly unbundeled Sunsoft cc compiler.

The .pine-debug file had normal debug info at first, then the lines
 
	-----  MAIL VIEW  -----
	 
	  
    -----  MAIL VIEW  -----
						  
repeated thousands of times.  

Any ideas?

There is no plain MacOS port as far as I know, but I just saw a demonstration
today of Pine running under MachTen on a PowerBook.  Hopefully the code will
be in Pine 3.91 or so...

Interestingly enough I have the same problem trying to run WinPine under 
OS/2's TCP/IP interface (and OS/2's windows, of course).
Even odder, it has worked OK just twice!
I also get a stuck state when trying to postpone (^-O).

I have so far been prepared to be convinced that this is an 
incompatibility between OS/2 windows and "real" windows, but I am 
encouraged by your finding (and others in this group) to think that it 
may be bug(s) in winpine after all.

Dealing with incoming-folders on remote hosts, isn't there some way to
deactivate the validation mechanism? It's a drag to always have to enter
your id and password for access. I thought that '.rhosts' was suppost to
take care of this. Am I doing something wrong?

I have just obtained Pine 3.90 for Windows (winsock) and have
tried it over two protocol stacks--Frontier Technologies SuperTCP
and Sun PC-NFS.  The program works very well for everything except
sending mail.  Any attempt to send mail locks the computer,
usually requiring a reboot.  I have attempted to send to several
different SMTP servers, all with the same result.  I have tried it
over ethernet and slip.  I have also watched (with snoop) and
noticed that it doesn't even attempt to open port 25 on the mail
host before it locks.

I'd appreciate it if anybody has any ideas concerning this
problem.

Do you mean into the same account that you're already logged into?  If so you 
can do this by having your news and mail directories be the same.  One way to 
do this is to link them.  Another way is to use the same name for Pine and 
NN's folder directory - I use ~/Folders (you set this in the ~/.pinerc and 
~/.nn/init files).  Then when you read an article with nn that you want to 
save just type "s" (for save) and "+saved-messages" and it will be appended 
to your saved-messages folder.  Now you can use either Pine (with
"pine -if saved-messages") or NN (with "nn +saved-messages") to view, print,
forward etc.

If you mean into a different account then you could probably do it using
mail filtering.

Hope this helps,
Nancy

I had problems printing from Pine with WinComm but I also
had problems with Terminal and PCAnywhere (both Windows programs).  I've
had no problems with DOS Kermit and the DOS software that came with my
modem.  I finally figured out that I could print with WinComm if I changed
my printer driver from "HP Laserjet 4/4M Postscript" to "HP Laserjet 4/4M" -
my postscript printer seemed like it was interpreting my Pine messages
as postscript or some other language.

A while ago I posted asking people to send me info about what Comm Software
worked (and didn't work) with Pine's Y command and said I'd post what I found 
out.  Someone wrote that s/he had been able to use WinComm without any problem.
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to post what people sent me  - I will post it
soon so if anyone has extra info to mail me about printing, please do.

Thanks,
Nancy

Subject: PC-Pine 3.90 cannot send mail
Message-Id: <CwxoK7.2C3@utu.fi>
Date: Fri, 30 Sep 1994 08:21:43 GMT

I just updated my PC-Pine from version 3.89 to 3.90 using the build-in
update option. For some reason, I now cannot send mail (everything else
works just fine). Under version 3.89 I had no problems, using the same
pinerc file. When I try to send mail, I get a message "Sending mail..."
and after a minute or so pine asks if I'd like to break contact to server.
When I do, I get a message "Error connecting to mail server:". I suppose
my smtp-server's name should appear at the end of the error message, but 
it doesn't. Changing the smtp-server's name in pinerc from 'mailhost.utu.fi'
(our mailhost) to plain 'mailhost', or to the real name of the server, or
to ip-address of the server results doesn't help. And the older version of
Pine still works fine. Has anyone encountered similar problems when updating
PC-Pine ? Any suggestions ?

We are running FTP Software's PC/TCP 2.31.

Message-Id: <1994Sep30.102033.115@vms.huji.ac.il>
Date: 30 Sep 94 10:20:33 GMT

  Since the release of Pine-3.90 I am trying to port it to VMS. C-CLIENT and
Pico went ok, but I have a few problems with Pine itself. Since I do not have
much time to work on it, I am releasing a "half baked" version of it. Try it
and decide whether you can tolerate the defficiencies of it or not. I hope to
have time someday to finish the port.
  The 3.90 version does not support address book (some problems which I am
trying to chase), does not support message postponing (the mechanism was
changed in a way which is incompatible with VMS/MAIL). IMAPD was not ported
either. I've tested it only with Multinet.

To get the PINE-3.90 release (includes .EXE file compiled under VMS-5.5-2 and
Multinet):  ftp: //vms.huji.ac.il/local/pine_3-90_beta_1.zip

If you want IMAPD then grab PINE_BETA_9.ZIP (the 3.89 version), build IMAPD
from there and copy iy elsewhere.

I have a 386-40 with 8 megs of memory, windows 3.1, dos 6.21, and the 
problem occurs even if I only run crosstalk for windows.

The following problem shows itself when a user has a value set in a field 
that sys-admins have decided to forbid by the pine.conf.fixed route (eg 
printer, nntp-server, ,...)

When starting up pine3.90 sees the value when reading .pinerc, and
complains 
"Pinerc variable xxxx has been administratively fixed by the 
system management. You are not allowed to change it"

and after a delay to allow the message to be read, Pine carries on.

If the user then tries Setup Config to remove the offending item, Pine
will not permit the edit ("cannot alter sys-admin fixed value), so he is 
forced to leave pine and edit the pinerc. 

We would much rather our naive users never had to touch .pinerc with an 
editor!

Is this just a bug (failure to distinguish the pine.conf.fixed value from 
one spuriously set in .pinerc)?

If not, then would it possible to enter a dialog at the point, of the kind

"Do you wish to remove the option from you configuration?"
with the usual Yes/No/Cancel possibilities.

There are filters out there for that purpose. Look for filter or 
procmail, as they will probably be the easiest to start with and the 
best. Hope this helps.

I'd like to see the time included in this line, like:

"On Tue 27 Sep 1994, at 7:42pm EDT, you wrote:"

Message-Id: <1994Sep30.143040.73766@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu>
Date: 30 Sep 94 14:30:40 CDT

I got the binaries for 3.90 for OSF and AIX. With both, when
addressing myself with just my account name an incomplete domain name
is appended to the right of the @ sign. Example: On lark.cc.ukans.edu
when I address myself, I type

paul

then hit tab to get to the next field. Appended is an @cc.ukans.edu
NOT lark.cc.ukans.edu

The full value lark.cc.ukans.edu is in the .pinerc (I know, because I
editted it in there).

What am I missing? Thanks! (Toggling the use-only-domain-name doesn't
make any difference.)

Pine 3.90 forces all folders to have permissions only for the owner. 
(usually a good thing -- privacy and all that) is there any way to share 
folders between groups, other than an explicit chmod by the owner?

Applications: - having root share the sysadmin's usual home mail folders
              - sharing folders you save neat stuff in with others who 		
                may not read all the news....

Are you on a dialup?  If so, it could be the terminal server.  On the
Ciscos here at Columbia, you have to press ^^ _twice_, because the first
one's interpreted as an escape signal (pressing ^^x gets you to the dialup
prompt).

	How would one specify a "hard-coded" mail header in Pine.  For
	example, if I wanted all my outgoing mail to have a "Reply-To:"
	field of "abc@tamu.edu", how would I do it?

	Thanks,
