Van den Berg is correct and Dhesi is wrong.

According to RFC 822, the contents of the Message-ID header is a rule
called "msg-id".  Buried inside a Message-ID is something called a
"domain"; which, in spite of the name, is not necessarily an Internet
domain name.  Unfortunately, this tends to confuse certain sorcerer's
apprentices.

Nor is it required to have any embedded periods.  A domain consists of
a "sub-domain", followed by zero or more period/sub-domain pairs.  A
sub-domain, in turn, may be a "domain-ref", which is a single atom.

The bottom line is that:
	Message-ID: <a@b>
is syntactically valid according to RFC-822; and those who claim
otherwise have mis-read the specification.

So, by the way, is:
	Message-ID: <a@blurdy\@bloop.[1.2.buckle.my.shoe].3.4.shut.the.door>
Try and see if your software swallows this!  [Hint: Pine does just fine.]


The relevant elements of RFC-822 syntax follow:
     msg-id      =  "<" addr-spec ">"            ; Unique message id
     addr-spec   =  local-part "@" domain        ; global address

Yes, you can see a picture if it is sent to you as attached file. Just 
use your usual "V" command to view the attached file. If your .pinerc 
file is properly configured you should be able to see it. You can 
configure your .pinerc file from the main menu of pine by pressing S for 
"Setup", and then chosing C to configure the .pinerc file. Now press W 
for "where is" and find image-viewer. Now press A to add value to that 
field, I have put xv in that field you can put in the name of any viewer 
that your system has.

Pine is very user friendly. If you want to know more about it just play 
around with it, use help, look at the command menu that appears on the 
bottom of the screen, and you would know everything I know about pine.

Hope that helped

Greetings:

We are currently operating Pine on four D.G. Unix servers.  We will be 
linking various other Unix servers, and a few Novell networks.  They have 
chosen GroupWise to operate on the new networks, in both ascci and 
graphics modes.  Is it possible to transfer mail from GroupWise to Pine 
and visa versa with little or no interaction from the user?  Response can 
either be via news group or private Email.

Thank You in advance;
Dennis Staley

Just as a side note, simply looking for `illegal' characters is not
enough.  You have to do full rfc822 parsing.
I.e. <"bla_BLA-"@some.domain.name> is a correct messageid.

Well, yes, if you must, there is indeed a third requirement:
   3. To the left of the @-sign, there must be some text that should *look*
      like the local part of an e-mail address.

Right, indeed.  The RFC says unique in time and space.  But the rfc
does not say that the part to the left of the @ sign should be
locally unique and the part to the right of the @ sign should be
globally unique.

There is absolutely no reason why one couldn't switch the meaning of the
left and the right side (as long as one adheres to the formatting requirements
of the left and right sides).  You could easily put a string that encodes
the FQDN to the left of the @ sign, and put some locally generated
unique string to the right of the @ sign.

The only thing you have to ensure is that the *entire* message id is unique
in time and space.  How you accomplish this, is entirely your choice
(be it by magic, or whatever encoding scheme you have in mind).

E.g. if you put merely the hostname without the fully qualified domain
part to the right of the @ sign, then you could, for example, ensure
uniqueness by encoding the IP number of the machine in the left part
(or some other particularly unique info you have about your machine).

So, using the FQDN to the right of the @ sign sure is one way to get
to a unique and valid message id, but it is by no means the only way.

I'm no expert on pine or mail systems but here is my two cents.

My understanding is that what you are trying to do is better
handled in what is typically referred to as the MTA usually
something like sendmail or smail.  Pine, which is a MUA, basically
just presents the message given to it by sendmail.

I've done something similar to what you're looking to do by
modifying smail on my Linux system.  I suggest you look there
first.  You may want to get the O'Reilly book on sendmail.

(It is usually considered improper netiquette to post from a system 
management account such as 'root', 'daemon' or 'postmaster'.  You may 
want to consider creating your own account for the purpose of email and 
news.)

First, the easy one, mtest.  Ignore it.  It is a little c-client tester 
and unless you have some very strange problems with mailbox accessing and 
you want to play around with low-level functions, you'll never need it.

imapd is a bit more difficult, but the following steps should do it (as 
root):

1. Move the imapd binary wherever you would like it (/usr/local/etc is my 
   choice, some prefer /usr/etc).

2. Append the following line to the end of /etc/services:

imap            143/tcp          

3. Append the following line to the end of /etc/inetd.conf:

imap   stream   tcp      nowait      root       /usr/local/etc/imapd imapd

(if you put imapd somewhere other than /usr/local/etc/imapd, put that 
name there)

4. Create a link to /etc/rimapd:

# ln -sf /usr/local/etc/imapd /etc/rimapd

5. Refresh inetd:

# kill -1 InetdPID

where InetdPID is the process ID of the inetd process.

You're done.  All this information, by the way, is included in your Pine 
distribution in the doc/tech-notes.txt file.

I don't see how the RFC could be made more clear.  After receiving a
{0}, the server sends a command continuation request response like it
does for any literal.  Afterwords, the server reads 0 octets of
argument data, followed by the rest of the command.

Hello, we are using Pine 3.91 on a SOLARIS 2.4 Sparc 20, which is using
smail3.1.29 as the transport. Whenever I send a message to a person on the
system, it fills in @hostname instead of @hostname.domain, and does this
in the reply to field also, so that mail is going out as if were from
user@hostname instead of using user@hostname.domain.
Therefore mail fails to return to me properly. ARGH.

`hostname` returns the hostname
`domainname` returns the domain name

Where does pine look to find out the Fully Qualified Domain Name?

Hi,
	I saw this message in pine-info.current but no followup.  I have a
similar problem.  I can connect fine to my UNIX IMAP server from a PC and
read my mail on the UNIX server.  However, when I want to send a message,
it cannot find the SMTP server.  There seem to be confusing instructions
about whether it requires an SMTP server.  One place it says that it will
use sendmail as a default, another place it says that PC-Pine requires
SMTP.  The latter appears to be the case because if I leave "smtp-server" 
blank in the config file, it keeps asking for the SMTP server.  When I
specify the same server to which I connect to read the mail, it cannot
connect.  That UNIX system has been used for years with pine for regular
login users. It may be that the UNIX server is not propoerly set up as an
SMTP server even though there is an entry in /etc/services.  However, I
have a hard time finding information about how to set it up as an SMTP
server.  Anyone can help me with this? 

Thanks,
Coenraad Bakker

I saw no posts in the group that answered this question.  You're the only

I was able to solve the problem of entering French characters by changing 
the pico source code. There is a range of characters (including most of 
the French characters) excluded from entry. I don't know why this range 
was excluded so I just allowed the entry of these characters. If any one 
wants to know how to do this email me and I will post the changes I made 
to the source to allow this.

There's this interesting bug(?) I found in Pine. When I receive a
forwarded message from another user using a non-Pine mailer, Pine splits
the mail into two separate mails: One is an empty mail from the user
forwarding the message which merely contains "So-and-so writes:", and
the second mail contains the text of the mail, and appears to come from
the original sender. Does anyone know why this happens and what I could
do to rectify it ?

Another possibility:

If you are using a pseudo-SLIP or pseudo-PPP program, such as TIA or
SLiRP, programs running locally are unable to bind to port 513, which rsh
uses.  "Reserved ports" (those with numbers under 1,024 on most operating
systems) cannot be bound unless the process has root authority. 

rsh, rlogin, etc., simply won't run if you are using a pseudo-SLIP or 
pseudo-TIA program, and you must use the {hostname:143}INBOX form in 
order to keep Pine from trying the rsh method, which will hang indefinitely.

To All:

I'm interested in installing PINE on a HP 8XX computer w/9.04.

Would someone be able to tell me what kind of info should be present
in a users ' profile?

Is there any kind of 'cookbook' method somewhere that I can read?

The designers of RFC 822 didn't choose to use the addr-spec format
arbitrarily.  It was clearly the *intent* of RFC 822 that this global
uniqueness be accomplished by creating a locally-unique local part and
using the globally-unique name or address of the sending host to the right
of the @.  Other than "by magic", there's simply no other way to ensure
that message ID's are globally unique (given existing protocols -- another
possibility is some central message-id registry, but there isn't one).

Gerry,

The behavior you described for Linux is the expected Pine behavior (though
you will see Reply-To: and Cc: if they exist).  I am not familiar with the
Unisys port (where did you get it?) but it should behave the same.  You
should _never_ see a Recieved: header, etc, in Pine unless you specifically
enable the full-header command and use it...

That is correct.  The end of the header is actually two consecutive
newlines, the end of the last line followed immediately by another
newline.  If that appears before the end of the headers, whomever put it
in needs to be hung :)

Sorry about the previous confusion...

One of two things is expected:
1) either a space and subsequent arguments to the command.
2) CRLF to complete the command

Or, as you put it, "still the rest of the previous command".

Being right has has never stopped me from being wrong.  My philosophy
re 'right' vs 'wrong' may be extracted from the saved posting that is
appended below.

It would be interesting to know:

   What is pine's algorithm for guaranteeing uniquenss without ensuring
   that the right-hand-side is in the form of a dotted domain name?

All my mail scripts written in perl test for the end of header with
something like this:

   if (/^\s*$) {
      ...
   }

A line with only blanks is treated as end of header.  I don't try too
hard to be RFC-conforming, but I do try to accomodate BITNET and other
IBM-based sites, which do not distinguish between empty lines and blank
lines.  I also try to accomodate people who manually generate messages
and might accidentally add some blanks in the separating empty line.

In your argument with the other party, you were probably talking at
cross-purposes.  Many wars begin when people talk about being 'correct'
or 'portable' when they really mean 'standard-conforming'.  Correctness
has to do with whether or not something works in its intended
environment.

I notice that every time I send a message, it gets copied to a folder 
called "sent mail". Is there any purpose behind this?  As as far as I'm 
concerned, I don't need to keep those messages around. Is there a way to 
tell the Pine to quit doing this - or at least ask me whether I want to 
save a particular message?

No, I do not have to parse anything. I am not simply looking for
illegal characters, I am removing them. The result is a valid message
id. It may not be the same message id, but I have a copy of the
incoming one, and either a copy of the outgoing or the ability to
recreate it, so it doesn't matter.

Then there is also a fourth requirement: 

    4. The message id cannot contain certain characters. For example,
	spaces are prohibited in the domain part. This is not a
	complete list.

Please read the RFC before continuing to comment. The RFC does, indeed,
specify that the local part is unique, but since it does not specify
how it is to be made unique, it cannot be guaranteed to be anything but
locally unique.

It also specifies "domain" for the right side, and because of DNS and
the way domain names are created, it will be globally unique.

No, the RFC does limit you.

No, sorry. How the local part is created is up to each system. That
means, yes, you can encode what you want there, but that also means
others can encode the same things the same way and come up with the
same thing.

>So, using the FQDN to the right of the @ sign sure is one way to get

With the current RFC, it is the only way. Yes, you can come up with
other schemes, but those schemes are not RFC compliant.

Yup, I have the same problem. I can connect via imap no problem, but I 
can't send a message. As far as I understand it, you don't need anything 
special on the PC-Pine end (gateways or anything). The UNIX smtp server 
should just pick up the connection request at port 25.

I had to fill in my own 'smtp server:' field in the pinerc file. Here it is:
smtp-server: PAMCO_UX

this is the host name of our computer (we're not on the net so I don't 
have to worry about any further domain designation, etc.)

When I try to send mail I get an error "SMTP connection went away".
The system logs show that there was a connection, and it even creates a 
directory in the /var/spool/smtpq area for the incoming connection but NO 
DATA is transferred!!

I posted before and got a little response.(still haven't got it working)

Some suggested that it was due to a faulty TCP/IP stack on the PC end of 
thing (the Novell stack wasn't great).

I also would appreciate any help getting this to work.

    Thanks for replying.  I was aware of these points (especially how to 
configure Pine).  Somehow I had the idea (perhaps mistakenly on my part) 
that someone was claiming to have coerced a delivery reciept from a 
receiving end by doing something on a sending end.  As you point out, 
not all systems even respond to the Return-Receipt-To: field if it is 
present.

    I certainly do not have any kind of figures, but I speculate that
a significant portion of non-Unix systems (e.g., IBM VM/PROFS) do not
recognize this field.  In such a case, there is nothing the person using
Pine to *send* mail can do, short of getting a new Internet standard
through and waiting for it to be universally implemented.

No folder opened.  Once it says that, it will allow me to compose 
messages, and open all the saved mail folders, except for the INBOX. This 
is really annoying. It happened on June 1st, right after the program 
prompted me to move all sent-mail to May-sent-mail. If ya need any more 
information I would be happy to oblige. Thank you in advance for any help 
you can give me.

If I may, I would tag onto this query with a slightly different problem--

I run PC Pine on my home machine mainly for the purpose of being able to 
read OFFLINE my (Unix) Pine mail (which I get on a dialup acct at the school 
where I teach).  I ftp the Unix Pine folders to my home machine.  Problem 
is, while the PC Pine will read these Unix Pine folders OK, the folders 
are READ-ONLY.  I can copy individual articles to PC Pine folders, but I 
cannot then delete the thus-transferred articles from the Unix Pine folders.

Can anyone tell me if there is a way I can carry out a "MASS" copy of the 
entire Unix pine folder to a PC pine folder, so I won't have to fool with 
dozens or hundreds of individual article copyings?

Also, is there anyway of tagging articles (using the ";" key or whatever 
as in Unix pine) and then applying a command en masse?  I have PC Pine 
3.91 for Windows/Winsock and cannot figure out how to access this feature 
which I so love on the Unix pine.

I currently have 7  BSDI boxes.  Is it possible to forward all mail to a new 
(8th) machine 
and have all my users get mail from that machine without logging into it?

I am using Pine 3.91 and BSDI v2.0

I want to avoid the following:
	1. users logging into the mail server.
	2. entering users into the new machine
	3. letting the users know the machine is there.

Thanks

X-Status: 

I just returned from 2 weeks of vacation to find my Pine working 
improperly.  Somehow my "sent-mail" folder got marked as read-only and I 
can't write anything to it.  It gives a "[Can't open append folder: 
Permission denied]" error when it tries to write it as the FCC folder and 
also "[Can't open append folder: Permission denied]" error when I try to 
copy a message into it.  When I go into that folder it doesn't tell me 
that it's READONLY.  I've tried deleting the folder and then recreating 
it all with no effect.  I can't save any message to any folder, I get an 
"[Can't open destination folder: Permission denied]" error each time.  
I've also gotten a "[Append not valid for file]" for some folders that 
I've tried to save to.  The permissions on all folders are set to 600, 
and I've tried t changing that to 777 with no effect.  In addition, the 
directory has permissions 750. 

When I ran a session and just tried to save a message into a folder 
"junk", I got the following in the pine-debug file:
so_get error: /usr/users/geni21_users/morris/mail/junk : Permission denied

I'm really confused and would like to fix this problem.  If anyone can 
give me any helpful advice, please do.  I am at a loss of where to go 
from here.  

thanks,

    This evening I discovered a gotcha with my communications software 
and Pine on a dialup Unix.  I'll describe it, and anybody interested may 
email me for the fix, as it will apply only to a minority of readers.

    When composing/replying/forwarding in Pine, one may invoke an 
alternate editor (Alt Edit) with the keystroke ^_ (control-underscore).  
J. Kelly Cunningham's useful (thank you) tip of earlier today to replace 
the message-quoting characters makes use of this.

    I simply had had no reason to use this function before, so when I 
tried it, blooey!  Fortunately, the fix is simple.  I am using PROCOMM 
Plus Version 2 on an MS-DOS PC, Version 5.  PROCOMM Plus dials me into my 
Internet service provider, a BSD Unix system which has Pine 3.91 
installed.  When I press the ^_ key combination, I do not get whatever I 
specified for an alternate editor for Pine.  Instead, the screen flashes 
clear and shifts into 43-line mode!!!  It takes a bit of coaxing and 
coercing on the keyboard to get my Unix-and-Pine session back.

    Obviously, what you see ain't what you get.  Although I have not 
found it yet in the PROCOMM documentation, ^_ obviously does not send the 
desired value (hex 1F, I think) back to the host.  Instead, PROCOMM Plus 
intercepts it and does weird things.  Fortunately there is a simple 
solution involving PROCOMM Plus's keyboard remapping program.  If my 
scenario fits your situation, email me and I'll send instructions on how 
to do it, rather than take up space here for those not affectd.

Type the nickname into the CC header - PINE will fill in the
email address from your addressbook - use cntrl/K to cut it out
of the CC header, then move the cursor to the body of the mail and
use cntrl/U to paste it into the mail.
 
"Write it down" - what's that?  ;-)

I have been working with Andrew on this problem.  I posted several weeks
ago, but the only person who answered didn't have a clue as to how the
restricted environment works.

First, rsh will refuse to exec anything with path info in it.  It rather
primitively checks for /'s and exits with an error message.  This is part of
the protection mechanism of rsh that keeps the restricted user from
accessing things you do not want her to.

When I inspected the src code, I found that pine calls spell with system().
Even when 'SPELL=spell; export SPELL' was added to the ruser profile, the
system() call seems to try to add path info, which causes rsh to refuse to
exec it.

If Andrew or I figure this out we will post.  I am hoping I do not have to
reimplement the portion of the code that now uses system().

If the file you are attaching is ASCII, there should be no need to attach
the file using MIME.  Simply read the file into pico (^R).

=====================================================
Nancy,

I am able to VIEW Unix pine folders with my PC pine (I ftp the Unix pine 
folders from my work Unix account to my home PC where I run PC Pine for 
Windows/Winsock (not a "real" MS-Windows implementation of pine).

PROBLEM IS...the Unix pine folder is READ-ONLY, so that although I can 
view the individual articles and can copy them (one-by-one) to a PC pine 
folder, I cannot *delete* them from the Unix pine folder under PC pine, 
nor can I do a MASS copy of the Unix folder to the Pc folder format.

Can you or anyone else suggest a way to ease this Unix/PC pine folder 
format incompatibility?  I am somewhat of a pine newbie, but is there a 
way to find out the particularities of the format difference between a 
Unix pine folder and a PC pine folder, so that perhaps one could hack out 
a conversion utility?  (some of my Unix pine folders are 2-3 megabytes 
and article-by-article conversion is not very enticing!).

Also any word on when there will appear a PC for Windows incarnation that 
has all the neat features of the latest Unix pine version?

Thanks!

    What you are describing is Pine's default action.  If you do not want 
to save any particular message, put the cursor on the Fcc line in the 
header and press ^K to omit the value.  Pine will then not save that 
message.

    If you do not want Pine to save _any_ outgoing message (not a good 
idea, in my exerience), go into Setup (off the main menu) and 
Configuration.  On the first screen set the default-fcc value to two 
double quotes (nothing in between them).

On AIX 3.1 /usr/ucb/rsh is anyway a link to /usr/bin/rsh.

I am using Pine 3.91 on my mac right now. So it definitely exists. But I 
don't know anything about software, so don't ask me whether it's good. I 
assume it's good, because I got it from a computer programmer who uses it 
on his Mac - with all the bangs and whistles.

	I have compiled and installed Pine 3.91 on our system (Unix SVR4) 
and it seems to work great.  The only problem that we've been having is 
the way Pine functions on some Wyse 50 terminals that we have.  

	Pine does not repaint the screen correctly and none of the keys 
seem to work correctly.  The arrow keys will not move around in the menus 
or do what they are supposed to do.  

	Can anyone help or is this just a problem where Pine won't work 
with a Wyse 50 terminal?  Any help would be appreciated.  

	Thanks in advance.

	I posted here about a month ago, and recived no response, I'd
really like to be able to recomend pine as the mailer of choice for our
faculty and staff, however there is still one problem that I need to
solve. 

	The only problem I am having is that some messages (recived by
pine) are not showing the senders name from the folder.  instead, they
are listed as "to: USER", where USER is the recipient.

	Now, if someone has the enable-full-header-cmd of the
feature-list configuration set up, then they can find out who sent the
message.

	I have narrowed the problem down to old mailers, (I think) which
use the "From" field in the header, but not the "From:" field.  Is there
any quick fix that will allow a user to see who a message was sent from
without relying on trying to explain the command to our many users???

	Thanks!

I'm wanting to run pine on one of my unix machines which is a 486 
PC running sunsofts interactive unix (system V). The problem that 
I don't have a compiler for this machine and I'm therefore trying to 
track down an ftp site that I can obtain a precompiled binary file to run
on this platform.
I've looked on cac.washington.edu and can't find anything apart from the 
source code (little use without a compiler).

Does anyone have any suggestions on where I can look !!!
Many thanks.

Which mail systems? MS Mail? Many systems will offer a 'neat' view (4 or
5 headers) or a 'raw' (all) view and will allow switching between. I suspect
they've seen VMSmail... I'd get some clarification.

Pine 3.91 will show Reply-To headers by default, so this will be header
number 5 for you :-(

Start PINE, press S and then C to enter configuration screen. You'll now 
see a lot of configurable options, use arrow key to move down until you 
see option "customized-hdrs="  Press A to add value to it. You should add

Reply-To: rallen@knight.city.ba.k12.md.us

Another way that you might prefer is to set the value in option 
"user-domain".  You can set it to "knight.city.ba.k12.md.us" and it will 
be used in From: line for all your outgoing mail.

Hope this help.

        One fairly kludgy way to do it in a particular instance is to 
    delete the .sig, write your reply however you like, and at the end
    use control-R to import .signature from your home directory.
        I liked it so much I made up a .sig.min with two shorter sig 
    files to put there, and I'll just delete whichever I don't want.

This is probably more a communications than a Pine problem ...

Our users have a lot of problems printing to their attached
printers.  Typical symptoms are blocks of text missing in
the printed message, or local system lock-up after a portion is
printed.  

(This is Pine 3.91 running on Dec Alphas, OSF/1.  Users
are accessing via modem, hard-wired serial and network
connections.  Problems seem most severe for the modem
users.  A variety of communications packages are used;
the problem occurs with Kermit for one.)

Sometimes the problem can be traced to software vs. hardware
handshaking between the user's micro and their modem, but not
always.

Does anyone have a grasp on this problem?  Maybe the communications
packages they are running?  The speed or setup of their printer?

I'm going to go out on a limb here as say that most users are looking for 
a functional capability of viewing their INBOXes off line and operating 
on the INBOXes as if attached to their UNIX server.  They probably don't 
care what format they are in.

I'll bet a neat feature would be to queue up message responses (replies, 
forwards, bounces) off-line and have them processed upon reconnecting to 
the UNIX server.  CIS users wanted/got this feature from a number of 
products, including TAPCIS.

That's my .02 dollars.

There *WILL* be a read/write mbox driver on DOS in the future.  The
question is what form this will take.

Here's the full story:

The present mbox driver for DOS, bezrkdos, is a read-only driver.  This is
because of the nature of mbox format folders.  In the mbox format, it may
be necessary to rewrite a message with a "Status:" and "X-Status:" header
line that is not present in the message.  This, in turn means that you can
not overwrite the folder in place without maintaining a separate copy of
the subsequent messages.  You can't just read the subsequent messages
while you're updating the previous messages, because a previous message
can grow and overwrite a subsequent message.

To work around this problem, the UNIX mbox driver in Pine keeps all
messages in memory.  This is simultaneously boon and bane; it's a boon
because searches are all in memory and thus *very* fast, bane because it
makes some Pine memory images huge.  Of course, there's no way you can do
this on DOS with a 640K limit!

Another way is to write to a separate copy of the file.  Unfortunately,
there is a requirement on many UNIX systems that the inode of the folder
be preserved.  So, you can't just write to a new copy and then rename the
new copy to the old name.  The upshot is that you would have to copy to
the separate file, then copy back.

A further problem with writing to a separate file is that a lot of our
in-house users (the community that funds Pine development!) are at the
limit of their disk quotas and do not have the free space available to
permit a second temporary copy of their mail folders.

What does this have to do with DOS?  Well, the question becomes *why* do
you want a folder in mbox format on DOS.  Tenex format is used on DOS, and
PC Pine handles tenex format much better than it could ever handle mbox
format.

There are two answers to this "why".

One is that people just want to FTP their mbox format files to the PC and
work with them on the PC.  There's no need to worry about the UNIX inode
or locking restrictions, and most PC users have plenty of disk space.
This is true, and it wouldn't be too hard to make a read-write mbox driver
on DOS for these guys.  But on the other hand, it's even easier to use PC
Pine to covert the mbox folders to tenex format on the PC, or use PC Pine
to copy them from the UNIX system into tenex format using IMAP.

The other one is that people who have NFS mounts from UNIX to their PC
want to manipulate their UNIX folders from the PC over NFS (instead of
over IMAP).  This present several problems; all of the UNIX problems plus
all of the DOS problems.  How do we do the UNIX locks on DOS?  How do we
make sure the same inode is preserved?  How do we avoid disk quota
problems?

Unfortunately, the NFS answer is the compelling reason for mbox format
support in PC Pine at our site.  We haven't figured out how to do this
read/write while still being safe yet.  We do *not* want to "just do it"
and then have thousands of bug reports about crashed mail folders.  We get
enough of these when we're careful!  ;-)

So, that's the issue.  Input from the external user community on this is
solicited.  Specifically:
	Why do you want to use mbox format on DOS, given that Pine has a
	 read/write format that it can handle much better/faster/safer?
	How do you anticipate using a read/write mbox driver?
The answers to these questions affect *how* a read/write mbox driver would
be implemented, given all the tradeoffs that have to be made.

    If I recall (coming in late to this after a couple weeks off the
computer), you were using a PC Alt-key numeric sequence to enter your
character.  The code you used was outside the range of ISO 8859-1
printable fer'n language characters, being something like Alt-135
(ISO 8859 printable, that is, non-control, characters, are in the
range 160-255 decimal).  So the character you were typing was not a
Franch character as would be seen in the ISO 8859-1 character set, but
more likely the character as appears in a DOS code page.
    What you really want to do is to set up an ISO 8859-1 emulation
and use that to enter your characters, so they appear properly on the
displays which people are likely to use.  I had the same problem using
Mac NCSA telnet when I failed to change the character translation from
the Mac charset, where the German characters I was typing appeared in
the ISO 8859-1 control character range, and I got the error from Pine,
until I remembered and set ISO 8859-1 translation and then all went well.
    If your charset in your .pinerc is not ISO 8859-1 (that is, it is
MACINTOSH or CP850 or something comparable), then your solution works,
but be advised that the majority of displays capable of western European
characters support ISO 8859-1, and Pine does no translation from the
received charset to the display charset.

	Yup, I would read mail in whatever folder on my remote Unix machine,
and then "s"ave it to a folder on my local PC.  It meant that I had to have
it configured to recognize my INBOX, remote folder collections, AND local
folder collections, but it worked rather nicely for my purposes until...

	Note: I had taken this to email, but since it ended back up here
I figured I'd keep it here hoping someone might find a solution to my little

Here are a few possibilities that assume you are connected by a 
communications program using terminal emulation:
- If your server has kermit, execute kermit and initialize a file 
transfer (send <filename>), then invoke kermit receive on your Mac 
(somehow). 
- If your server has zmodem, type sz <filename>, and your Mac should 
automatically receive the file (using Zterm, for example)
- Open a log filel on your Mac and cat the file on the Unix system
with cat <filename>.

I think so.

I don't know of a direct way, but I've done this:

position on cc:
go to address book (^T)
select the address you want
delete it (^K) from the cc: line
move to your message
restore the line (^U) with the address


I've also used that approach to pull an address from a message I was 
forwarding or replying to to add the address in the header.

    You need to use mail filtering software to redirect mail into folders 
*before* Pine gets hold of it.  Pine by itself cannot do what you want, 
but mail filters can (I use one).  This is a frequent question on this 
group, so rather than repeat, email me if you are using Unix and I'll 
point you.

Thanks, Don

Actually the PC Pine documentation was where I originally found the 
statement that Unix pine folders would only be available to PC pine in 
"read only" format.  I do not know why this is so, but it is *not* due to 
the DOS "readonly" attribute being set.

What I really need to know is what the difference is between the PC and 
the Unix folder formats that creates this problem.

I have had a similar problem trying to set Pine for Windows up with 
access to our mail server. It turned out that our mail server was not 
running an imap or sntp server (imapd). PC pine uses the imap protocol 
and sntp and therefore requires the remote machine that you are trying
to access supports both of these.

Chris:

First: thanks re. the aggregate command enable option in the setup/config 
menu -- I "remembered" spotting it in the Unix pine option list just 
after my posting.

Second: regarding getting an error statement like
> 	[Can't connect to uxa.cso.uiuc.edu,143: Refused (10061)]

I have also gotten such an error statement from my PC pine back when I 
was still trying to use it to access my mail server via a dialup 
connection.  Because I never could get anyone to tell me what the error 
message meant (do the numbers "143" and "10061" have some significance to 
the pine "insiders"???), I finally gave up and now use my PC pine only to 
read pine folders that I have transferred by ftp from my dialup Unix pine 
operation to my PC pine (for Windows/winsock) on my home computer.  You 
didn't mention ftp; does that mean thatyou were somehow able to use your 
home PC pine to transfer pine folders from your mail directory on the 
remote unix machine?

Frankly, if it weren't for keeping my home phone lines tied up, I would 
much prefer using the dialup Unix pine setup --it is MUCH faster than the 
PC pine, and I love the way it blends mail and newsgroup browsing almost 
seamlessly.

But I risk losing a perfectly wonderful wife if I don't relinquish these 
phone lines more frequently!

Any suggestions from all the pine priests and priestesses out there?

    Yes.  In Pico (or in Pine when composing/editing), first press ^W for 
the Whereis command; then press ^Y to go to the top or ^V to go to the 
bottom.

Here is something to try out.

Connect to your SMTP server via TELNET, and give it an RSET command.  If
the connection closes, that is probably the problem.  Also check the EHLO
command, and make sure that your SMTP server doesn't close the connection
on that.

Recently, I have been made aware of the existance of broken SMTP servers
which think that a "reset" (get to initial state, no message in progress)
means "cancel the connection".  There are also a few that think that the
right way to indicate "unknown command" is to close the connection.

Your best bet is to beat up whomever provided you with that broken SMTP
server, and/or replace it with one that correctly implements RFC-821 (such
as sendmail).

The reason why Pine's SMTP client issues a RSET command is that it is
capable of sending more than one message in a single SMTP session.  This
will be an important facility for offline operation, where you may have
several messages composed offline and then want them to be delivered.

RSET ensures that no remnants of the previous transaction affect this one.
Your corporate president would be very upset if his message to his CFO
discussing possible layoffs got distributed to the rank-and-file by
accident.  Or your girlfriend might be upset that her steamy letter to you
got posted on the net....

There is no good way to patch this out without editing the sources and
rebuilding, and even if you do you'll get hosed in the future when offline
batching comes into being.  It's better, if at all possible, to get your
SMTP server fixed.

I've found the discussion of Message-Id headers kind of interesting, 
because on all of our hosts running SunOS, AIX, ConvexOS, and HP-UX, the 
pice that Pine writes to the right of the @ is the fully-qualified domain 
name.  I should mention that on these hosts, hostname(1) also produces a 
FQDN.

However, on our Solaris hosts, Pine only places the machine name on the 
right side of the @, not a FQDN.  Solaris's hostname(1) also returnns 
just the machine name.

I am told that if we were to run NIS on the Solaris machines, the problem 
would fix itself (and have verified that that is the case) but that isn't 
an option.

Is there a fix to this problem, besides running NIS or NIS+?  We don't 
run NIS and likely never will (NIS just doesn't scale when you get into 
thirty thousand or more users) and I worry that we are producing 
Message-IDs on our Solaris machines that have the potential for being 
non-unique.

sure, just set the feature 'signature-at-bottom' in the pine
configuration menu.  one thig to remember though...  this is put the
signature at the bottom of messages when you 'reply' to them.  when
you 'forward' something to someone, the forwarded message will always
go after the signature.

[Morris, your email address is degenerate and cannot be replied to.  You
should have your system administrator check into the reasons why, because
it is considered bad netiquette to post without a replyable email
address.]

It strongly sounds as if all your files have changed ownership while you 
were away.  You should have your system administrator check to be sure 
that the ownership hasn't changed.

Why would this happen?  Well, there are some buggy filesystems out there
I've seen where ownership can change for no good reason.  More likely,
however, is an error on the part of your system administrator.  When we
make ownership mistakes, it's something we're likely to never notice until
the user complains, since we almost always do such work as the superuser,
who can touch files regardless of permission and ownership.

  In the simtel archives there is a program called "readmail" that
  will allow you to read *and* manipulate pine folders without
  needing to convert them to pc ascii.

  It is not an offline mailer... reads mail but can not "send"
  mail.
  What I do, when can't have direct connection with my host... is to
  download (from a friend's machine) all my inbox... then read it
  and manipulate it with readmail, and if I need to write... I do
  use "pico" for pc... compose the mail... and then I upload and
  when in pine (unix) use the ^R (read file)... Clunky but
  effective.

  Waiting for the day that pine *is* an offline mailer :)

I'm not sure I have a grasp on the problem, nor the 'proper' way to fix

even 1200, the pine Y prYnt command works, otherwise is skips blocks as

temporarily slow down the modem, may not be pretty, but it works.  BYE.

	I use pine for most of my Usenet newsgroups but on occasion use

	I am used to pressing q to back up to the previous menu (article

pine and I press q instead of i to go back to the articl selection menu.  
I am given a choice of 'saving mail in MAILBOX' (a local feature) or 
not.  If I choose n for no I still get booted out of pine.  What should 
happen is that there should be a CRTL-C option there compliant with the 
other pine menus to abort the quit.

	It's VERY frustrating when this happens, to have to re-enter 
pine, then go to the Usenet News folder, especially with newsgroups of 
considerable size (i.e. >100 new messages).

	What can be done about this?  Is it a small feature to add 
whereby the local News admin. could just recompile their version of pine 
or would that be the responsibility of the authors of pine itself?

Yep.  Not that hard.

Good. That gives you two options, assumng you don't have users who are 
using other MUAs than Pine.

>I want to avoid the following:
>	1. users logging into the mail server.

No problem.  Are all your users using Pine?  Then your easiest and best 
course by far is to run IMAP.

What you do is your set your sendmail.cfs on all seven user machines so 
that they accept mail from anywhere and just send it on to the eighth 
machine.  This is easy if you're handy with sendmail.cf files, but I'm 
not going to tell you how to do it because it would increase the length 
of this message by about 300%.  Get O'Reilly's _Sendmail_ by Costales, 
Allman and Rickert if you need to learn how.

The eighth machine needs to accept mail from any of the other machines as 
mail for local delivery.  This, too, is a simple sendmail.cf hack. Make 
sure that usernames on the seven machines are all the same for the same 
people, and then put an /etc/passwd on the eighth machine containing all 
those mail users' usernames.  Periodically grab their /etc/passwd and/or
/etc/shadow entries so that the users' passwords are the same both on 
their login machine(s) and the mail server.  Or, if you're running NIS, 
make the mail server part of your NIS domain with the proper privileges 
to be able to read the password map.

Here's where the two options come in.  If you're not running Pine
exclusively, you'll need to export /var/spool/mail on the mail server to
the other seven machines via NFS, and hard mount them on all the other
machines' /var/spool/mail directories.  Don't allow interrupts, and don't
soft mount; if you do, you're asking for mailbox corruption.  You didn't
say whether the same user base exists on each of the seven login hosts. 
If you're not using NIS, make sure that the UID number for a given user is
the same on all eight hosts; otherwise mailbox ownership over NFS will be
corrupt. 

Even with non-interruptable hard mounts, NFS mounting of /var/spool/mail
is still a dangerous thing.  That's why, if you are exclusively using 
Pine, IMAP is a better option.  Compile and install imapd on the mail 
server; make the necessary entries in /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf.  
Place a link to the location in which you have installed imapd to 
/etc/rimapd.  Then in the /etc/hosts.equiv file on the mail server, list 
all the other seven hosts.  This is a possible security hole; make sure 
that you are comfortable with the security of the physical network on 
which the eight machines reside and with the security of the other seven 
hosts before you do this.

Now, create a pine.conf.fixed file on each of the seven login hosts
with the entry:

inbox-path={mail.server.name}INBOX

where you substitute the name of the mail server for mail.server.name 
above.

Now, if everything worked correctly, your users will start Pine, read 
their email, and never realize that anything has changed (assuming you 
migrated your users' mailboxes to the mail server machine when you did 
all this).

>	2. entering users into the new machine

Do you mean without adding your users to the /etc/passwd of the mail 
server?  Sorry; you'll have to do that.  I can think of one or two ways 
to do it using obscure sendmail delivery options so that you don't have 
to have all users in /etc/passwd, but it isn't at all worth it, because 
sendmail's security is largely based on the sanctity of users and usernames.

If you didn't, for instance, add <rmbill> to the mail server, how would 
sendmail know whether to accept or reject mail addressed to <rmbill>?  
You see now why you must add all users to a machine in order to allow 
them to receive mail there.

Of course, if you're using NIS, this can become easier (it sounds like 
you may have a small enough installation to where NIS wouldn't be a bad 
thing necessarily).

>	3. letting the users know the machine is there.

Again, I'm not sure what you mean with this.  If you mean, "without 
making the users change things in their setups", then you've done that 
with the pine.conf.fixed file change above; they won't have to do 
anything.  If, on the other hand, your intent is to not let them see the 
machine on the network--I think you're out of luck.  That's not very 
important though, IMHO; usually users ignore machines that they don't 
know the purpose of, unless they have cracking in mind.

If you want to *keep* users from being able to log into the mail server 
even if they try, you'll need to set their shell on the eighth machine to 
be something that doesn't allow login but that will allow /etc/rimapd to 
be run.  You can write one yourself, but the Pine development group have 
a good one called imapsh, which I believe is on their FTP server at 
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu.  If it isn't, it should be. :) I can send 
it to you if you don't find it.

Add it to /etc/shells, or users won't be able to run rsh on the machine, 
which is the point in the fake shell in the first place. :)

Hope all this helps.

The answer with version 3.91 is that you don't.  Yes, it's annoying, as I 
receive lots of email addressed to Trey@unc.edu, my shortest and easiest 
to remember address, but I read it at harris@email.unc.edu.  I have to 
delete trey@unc.edu from headers a lot.

I'm told that 3.92 will have an ability to do this.  (I hope it will have 
some sort of wildcarding or other method to deal with multiple hosts in 
the same domain.  Elm had a feature like you want without the 
wildcarding, which made it next to useless for me.)

actually, this would not make as much sense as it sounds (although i
have been in the very same situation many times).  if the option
"quit-without-confirm" is set, then pine just quits when you type q.
assuming that is already set, when you type q, pine knows it will be
quitting.  when it has a question for you, like should i move all the
read messages into the default folder, it just wants to know tha
answer to that question, and then it will go back to what it was
doing.  quitting.  

to get the type of functionality that you want, get rid of the
"quit-without-confirm" option.  this will then ask you everytime you
try and quit, if you really want to quit.  annoying, but sometimes, it
is quite worth it.

that tends to happen when you already have a pine session running, and
you suspend it, and then try to start another one.  the first session
had control over the file, and then the second one tries to grab it
unsuccessfully, and then neither session has the write access to it.
to fix it, make sure that you have no other pine processes running
when you start a new one.

p.s. - i fixed this problem at my site by making 'pine' a shell script
that checks to see if you are running pine already, it you are, it
tells you, if you are not, it runs 'pine.real'.

Whenever I use Pine, my name appears in quotation marks as "Peter H.

either.  Other people in my firm don't get this.  Anybody know why?

You have a period in your name, which is used by address parsers to 
delimit adress components.  To avoid confusion, your name is quoted, so 
the periods will not be read as part of the address.

This is a repost of a msg sent two weeks ago to which there was no response.

Have any BitCom users experienced the "Expected Variable or Constant" 
message when attempting to move through a document line by line using the 
down arrow?  The same phenomenon occurs when using Joe as the editor.

Any ideas on how to fix this?

I have a Linux box running imapd connected to the internet via slip.  
Attached via ethernet, I have a win95 box running PC Pine.  I have 
checked my imap daemon and it is IMAP2bis Service 7.8.  

I have checked my services file and have IMAP enabled on port 143.  All 
connections to this port is refused even with the daemon running.  I 
cannot telnet to the port and the win95 box always gets refused 
connection.  Is there something else I need to configure on the Linux server?

I am not yet even trying to get out over the internet, just get my server 
to service my PCPine on win95 box.

I have checked the sendmail and it is ready but is running ESMTP.  I 
don't think this is the problem since I haven't yet conneced using IMAP.

I don't have the BitCom documentation, but I do know that if you logged 
in as a VT100, Pine and others are expecting <esc>OA for up, <esc>OB for 
down, <esc>OC right, and <esc>OD left.  If that isn't what BitCom is 
sending, then your results could be bizare.

To see what BitCom is sending, open a test file with vi (vi test.txt), 
then enter insert mode (i), type <ctrl>v followed by the up arrow.  This 
will cause the literal value of the up arrow to be displayed.  <esc>OA 
would be displayed as ^[OA.

It this isn't what you get, check your BitCom manual to see if you can 
reprogram your arrow keys.

Good luck.

PINE has not been ported to the Macintosh, and it probably never will be.  
You may be using PINE in a terminal (Telnet) window from a UNIX host, but 
it is not running on your Macintosh, since it does not exist for
Macintosh.  However, several other good (some free) IMAP clients do exist
for the Mac:

Thanks to all who replied.  Most people suggested making changes to my 
pine.rc file, which I'm sure would have worked.  I was setting this up 
for the whole system as root, so I really needed to change the pine.conf 
file.  The magic solution was:  Add a line in pine.conf that reads:

user-domain=knight.city.ba.k12.md.us

Thanks to all who responded.

How odd.  On my AIX 4.1.2 box, /usr/ucb is alive and well.   On my AIX 
4.1.1 box, /usr/ucb also exists, but has only about a dozen files in it, 
all links elsewhere.  Either this was a mistake in the distribution of 
AIX 4.1.1 which has now been fixed in AIX 4.1.2, or else it is because 
you have not done an "installp -o 'all_licensed'" off your distribution 
CD (something I haven't done on the 4.1.1 box but have on the 4.1.2 
box).  I recommend always doing the install of all licensed software on 
the CD, because factory installs of AIX often leave out some crucial stuff.

>On AIX 3.1 /usr/ucb/rsh is anyway a link to /usr/bin/rsh.

As on the 4.1.2 box.  In any case, you shouldn't need to change the 
source code; you can make the link in /usr/ucb since that directory seems 
to exist on all the 4.1 boxes I have.

 As the Pine docs say, filtering is left out - to be done by other

 It is a terminal emmulation problem (probably combined with the stupid 
control Mac playes over our keystrokes ;-(): on some Mac's here it 
doesn't work (some of those don't repeat keys held down either, 
incidentally), on most it does - and it's never a problem with PC 
terminal programs! For Ctrl-C etc. the Esc-Esc works, maybe it would for 
Ctrl-^ too ?!

What?  Your listing for going to the bottom is going to search for the 
next occurrance of the letter "v", and for bottom will place a lowercase 
'y' at the end of the current line.

The correct keys are control-w, control-v for going to the bottom, and 
control-w, control-y for going to the top.

It may be confusing, but it is nonetheless correct.  sendmail is a mail 
transport agent which runs on Unix hosts, not PCs.  On Unix, Pine will by 
default hand email to sendmail for delivery, unless you set smtp-server 
so that Pine will attempt to make the SMTP network connection itself.  
PCs, having no sendmail to which PC-Pine can hand email, must use the 
smtp-server method only.

Sounds like the IMAP server is not running sendmail in daemon (SMTP) 
mode.  Can you telnet to port 25 on your mail server?  If you can, and 
get some version blurb, then something is wrong with your Pine setup, 
because the framework is there for this to work.

If on the other hand you get a "port unavailable", "service unavailable",
or "connection reset by peer" message, then your IMAP server is not 
running the daemon to listen to the SMTP port.

Are you your this machine's administrator?  If not, you should contact 
her; most likely she will tell you of another machine which you should 
use as an smtp server instead (assuming you're connected to the Internet, 
you *must* be running smtp *somewhere*).  If you are this machine's 
administrator, then find out where in the /etc/rc* scripts sendmail gets 
started, and make sure that the "-bd" (begin daemon) flag is present.  If 
it isn't, the smtp daemon isn't being properly spawned.

If it is, then something is killing your sendmail daemon process.  You may
want to run a periodic script via cron to make sure that all daemons,
including sendmail, are running normally. 

Hope this helps.

Not sure what you mean by you 'converted them to text files'.  The pine
command is E to (E)xport, which will put a named file in your home
directory, then quit pine, and download it the same way you would download
anything else ... only my guess, sounds like maybe your tryin to download 
it while you're in pine ??  Hope this helps, if not, restate your

No.

It can't be done in any current Internet-standard mail delivery/reading 
scheme.  How it would be done is a good question.  Usually, the reason 
giving for wanting to know this information is to know whether someone is 
ignoring you or just not reading their email.

This is fine, but suppose they see your name and delete your message 
without reading it?  Should you get notification?  How about if the 
recipient reads mail offline?  Should you be notified when the mail is 
downloaded, even if the recipient may not have read the mail?  Notified 
the next time mail is downloaded, assuming that he reads his mail at 
least once in between each download?  Or some other method?

There are a heck of a lot of issues here that can be solved with 
complicated proprientary email solutions (I'm aware that several vendors 
have implemented this feature), but not with Internet mail.  Internet 
mail is essentially just files being transferred from one place to 
another;  having no central authority, no peer-to-peer verification, and 
no standard-issue client means that you have to assume lowest common 
denominator.  And receipt-on-read is an awfully complex feature to model
to the lowest common denominator.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say "even with the daemon running".  
Have you added the line

imap   stream   tcp    nowait   root    /usr/local/etc/imapd   imapd

To your /etc/inetd.conf?  Imapd does not handle multiple connections
itself and must be started using the Inet superdaemon.  If you have a line
somewhere in an rc file which actually runs imapd, you should remove it;
it isn't needed.

I just reread Myers draft on IMSP, and I can't find whether or not it

that it can be handled as a configuration variable like any other.

Has anyone (particularly in the Pine development team) considered this 
issue?  How will .newsrc files be handled over IMSP?

OOPS!

Of course, you are absoluetly right.

fine by me -- but instead using the names I gave above.  the whole
point would be to _decrease_ in-the-wrong-group traffic, not increase it!

I am having no success whatsoever using Pine to read remote mail on a server

As far as I know I have followed all the instructions, but always get 
"connection refused"
Does anybody know the correct incantation to get it working?

It's true, there is no filtering in Pine.  However, if you mark 
"enable-aggregate-commands" in the config file, you can sort things out 
pretty fast with the following sequence of commands:

;  -- enables aggregate command
t  -- mark by Text
a  -- search All text (sometimes the mailing list name is only in the CC)
s  -- Save
foldername -- folder you want to save it in
x -- eXpunge.  Removes the files.

You can then repeat the process if you have several mailing lists to deal 
with.  In the end, which comes pretty quick, you've got all your personal 
mail in front of you, and all the mailing list mail in the appropriate 
folders.  Personally I found this simpler and more fool proof than 
Procmail for mailing lists that generated under fifty letters a day.

Hope this helps,

Michael

Suggestions:

 o Upgrade to 3.91

 o Start by renaming your inbox file (e.g. /usr/spool/mail/drwood) to
something else, so a new inbox will be created for subsequent incoming
messages.

 o Look at the damaged file with an editor and see how it differs from a
valid mailbox... Look for extra newlines at the beginning of the file, for
example.  Or a message with a null in it.

None of that gets to the root cause of the problem, but it might give you
a start.

I think it will work like that in 3.92.  There are still some problems
because not all Date lines have enough information in them to easily tell
which timezone they came from.

Edit the /etc/hosts on the Solaris machine so that the FQDN for the local

At least a dozen people have emailed me with that.  But I've always put 
FQDNs first in /etc/hosts; I regard it a security hole to do otherwise.

What else could be causing this?

Jeff,
There almost certainly is a bug/mis-configuration --but I don't think
the bug is in Pine.  The missing "From: " header is the key.  This is
necessary, and if missing, the cause of the missing header should be
discovered and eliminated.  (The "From " line is a
local-mailbox-format-specific message separator, and has nothing to do
with RFC-822 headers.)

Often sendmail is configured to make sure there is a valid From: header
when an MUA does not provide one, but not all sendmails have been so
configured.  (That's one of the reasons Pine does create its own From:
headers.)

Hmm, you've got me.  I think it may be time to ask SUN what could cause
Solaris to return anything other than the official host name in the h_name
member of the returned hostent struct from gethostbyname().  h_name *is*
documented to be the official name.

If /etc/hosts isn't lying, is there any chance that you might have NIS/YP or
some other such thing running without knowing about it?  e.g. a rump YP that
is "switched off" but still responds to the local host name?

Hi,

I recently set up sendmail 8.6.12 on HP-UX. My idea was to use the
"userdb" feature to replace my unix login name with first_name.last_name
for outgoing mail using the "mailname" entry in the sendmail user data
base. This in fact works with mailx and elm, but unfortunately not with
pine, my favourite mailer. In outgoing mail, the unix login name takes
preference over the entry in the user data base, although pine is set up
to use sendmail. Since elm uses the sendmail user data base, it looks like
a set-up problem with pine. 

Any hints?

With kind regards, 
Otmar Stahl

Off the top of my head, I'd expect that if there were a call that returned
the FQDN, using it [in lieu of the call to hostname(1)] in the code that
builds the right hand side would fix your problem if you made this
replacement in the Pine code prior to compiling it <g>.

Jeff,
There almost certainly is a bug/mis-configuration --but I don't think
the bug is in Pine.  The missing "From: " header is the key.  This is
necessary, and if missing, the cause of the missing header should be
discovered and eliminated.  (The "From " line is a
local-mailbox-format-specific message separator, and has nothing to do
with RFC-822 headers.)

Often sendmail is configured to make sure there is a valid From: header
when an MUA does not provide one, but not all sendmails have been so
configured.  (That's one of the reasons Pine does create its own From:
headers.)

Bingo! That is exactly it. The server does not recognize the EHLO command 
- but it keeps the connection alive. The RSET command on the other hand 
causes the server to drop the connection immediately.

I've recently acquired and built sendmail 8.6.12 (the version that came 
with the machine is something stupid like 4.1 or something) so I think 
that I will install it as soon as possible.

The smtp daemon that we were using seems to be the vendor's one....that 
gives me a good excuse to beat up their software people (as you suggested ;)

Thanks for the help - I can finally move forward with this project!

It seems that pico on our AIX system wants to always write a file

      cd .elm
      pico filter-rules

acs3:/acs3d/teale/.elm--> pico filter-rules
xxx
^X

Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ?  Yes
File Name to write : filter-rules

acs3:/acs3d/teale/.elm--> ls ../filter-rules

../filter-rules

Is this a problem with our installation, a bug or a feature?

	Well, if you are getting a message like this:

	 [Can't connect to uxa.cso.uiuc.edu,143: Refused (10061)]

	 Which is what I get, then I'll pass on to you and everyone else
what I've been told (sorry, I don't have the gentleperson's name handy).  This
is probably stemming from the absence of an IMAP daemon on the server you are
connecting to.  If so, there's no variable or checkbox that will fix it.
Only the sysadmin can.

I'm the one who originally complained that FQDN's aren't generated under
Solaris, but I must retract my complaint after realizing it's not PINE's
fault. PINE uses a perfectly valid way of obtaining the local host's FQDN.

But the code doesn't work under Solaris 2.3 (library bugs). It does
under 2.4

It's because PINE generates a From: header while the other MUA's don't.
This is exactly why I think it shouldn't. That's why I used the following
patches to prevent it from doing so. It's not a perfect solution, but
it suited our needs very well.

Users can still change the from address if ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM is defined,
but it cannot be done through the personal-name field.

Note that modifications were made to osdep/os-sv4.c. You'll have to instead
make them to whatever osdep/*.c is apropriate for you.

Hi!

I hope that anyone can help me, from elm i know the 'autoreply'-feature, 
that will answere mails with an defined (defined means defined by the 
user e. g. when he's on holiday) text if set. Is there a feature like this 
implicated in pine?

And the second question: If i join a newsgroup, all (!) messages are set 
with 'NEW'-status. Now i can read messages, reply to some people. If i leave 
and open another group and then open the first group again, all messages are 
'NEW' again. In addition to that other flags (e .g. (A) for Answered) are unset 
when i leave and reopen the group.

Thx for helping me!

Thanks! I had a few other folks email me with this info,
so that is how I set it up. It seems to work fine when
I type "F" to followup my post via tin, but when I am
reading the newsgroup post with PINE, it wants to
post to ALL the newsgroups...

Sigh!

And if any of the list recipient's email/Internet provider charges
extra for sending Internet mail, those people will have to pay for your

Make your signature with any text editor (pico is pines default) and save 
it as filename .signature (please note, the '.' dot is important) and it 
will automatically attach.  Alternatively, and IMHO a better way is make 
a file and save it as something else (for example filename sig) and then 
attach it only when and where you want to, you can also make sig1, sig2, 
sig3, sigsex, siggolf, sigwhatever files, and attach them with the ^R 
(control+R) read in file command.  OK here comes sig3 (which is a 3-line 
signature)  BYE.

  By now the word is out that it is fairly easy to gain access to a shell 
from within Pine. With 3.91 you can check the enable-alternate-editor 
option and list your editor as "bash" or "csh" or whatever. Even if the 
administrator has pine.conf.fixed set up as no-enable-alternate-editor it 
still works if you can save a .pinerc file with the feature listed. The 
same is true of 3.89, even though you don't get the nice config screens. 
  Now, if you grant access to a shell anyway, this is all a moot point, 
but if you don't, it's a hole. Does anyone have any suggestions about 
this?

I get this message when using Pine, but I am having trouble tracking down why
it is doing this.  Obviosly the mail format has changed or something, but I do
not konw enough about POP3 to know what happened.  I use a POP3 mailserver and
suddenly it started happening (not sure if I indirectly screwed something up);
has anyone encountered something like this?

There already is such a call in the Pine code.

There always has been such a call in the Pine code.

That call is gethostbyname(), which accepts a name (in this case, the name
returned by hostname()) and returns a hostent struct.  The h_name member
of the hostent struct is documented as being the FQDN (or, in old ARPANET
terms, the "official name").

The problem is that many systems are misconfigured; often by accident, but
on occasion by bad advice from sorcerer's apprentices.  The single most
common misconfiguration is an entry in /etc/hosts for the local system
which puts the non-FQDN first.  There have been reports this problem which
appear to have other causes.  Both Yellow Pages/NIS from SUN and NetInfo
from NeXT are perfectly capable of being misconfigured as well.

The problem with the proferred "solution" of manually appending the domain
name is that if/when the system's configuration is ever fixed, then you'll
see doubled domain names, e.g. foo.bar.com.bar.com   So, instead of adding
a bug to work around a bug, it's usually best to fix the underlying bug
(assuming you can find it).

The short answer is that 99% of my attention has been focused on IMAP4
protocol and development, and that other than verifying that IMSP is A
Good Thing the draft has only been skimmed.

Now that the c-client based IMAP4 toolkit is in alpha test (it's on
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-4.ALPHA.tar.Z if you haven't gotten
the word yet), IMSP will be looming as the next major development effort.

I think that it is a safe assumption that IMSP will evolve, based upon our
experiences with fitting it to Pine's needs.   Hopefully, there won't be
*much* evolution needed.  But a lot of important matters were shelved on
the grounds that "this should be handled in IMSP, not IMAP4", and all of
these are going to come back up again.

   Put the following line in your ".cshrc" file and even if PINE crashes
   the size of core file generated will be 0.

   limit coredumpsize 0

   Remember "core" files are generated whenever a program crashes. So
   it holds for Pine, Mosaic.......and if you are an ordinary user, you
   don't need to worry about core files.

Next solution please!  Our hosts have the FQDN preceeding the node name 
in /etc/hosts, yet the problem persists on the SunOS boxes but not on the 
AIX boxes.

	I am using pine 3.91 on a UNIX system and attempting to a post to a

	[Error posting message: 441 User usenet does not exist! can"t post.].  

	I can read news fine both with rn and pine and if you get this it
proves I can post news with Pnews.  Apparently, I need to define something
somewhere but I am at a loss where that might be.  The nntp-server entry
in .pinerc is properly identified as sjfc.edu.  Does someone have a
suggestion?

    after you type ^^, to move the cursor to the other end of the

        If you want, so I'm told, you can move the cursor to still

    You might check in on the newsgroup alt.security.pgp, although in my 
own humble opinion there are a lot of fairly irrelevant posts on that 
group.  Nevertheless, somebody might be able to steer you in the right

Press (S)etup froom the Main Menu, (C)onfig and search in the feature

Pegasus uses some "private" headers for that function, since there's no official
method in the RFC822 mail standard supporting receipt acknowledgement.  Depending
on the mailer used at the remote end, you *may* find that getting Pine to insert
Return-Receipt-To: your-address
or
Acknowledge-To: your-address
headers (perhaps by adding either or both as "custom headers" in your Pine config)
will do what you want.  There's a group in the Internet Engineering Task Force
working on the specification of this type of facility, but until that's published
and widely implemented, only ad hoc methods like these may work and then only for
those recipients whose mailers support them.

You should probably have asked your local site news server administration 
before going further afield...

The problem is just what the error message says: "Authentication required".

Basically a news server can be set up so that whilst people can READ 
articles freely in order to POST an article they must first authenticate 
(supply a username and password) to the news server.  This, for example, 
allows logs to be kept so that offensive articles can be tracked back to 
the miscreant who posted them.

Judging from the error message your news server is set up in such a way.

However in its current incarnation Pine does not support authentication 
to news servers.

So you'll have to either persuade your news administrator to lift the 
restriction, or look at using another news reading program I think.

hey, man, i'm everywhere!  :)

you can find the script in ~karlsson/bin and it is called.  all you have
to do to make it work is make a directory called ~/bin and chnge your PATH
from
	export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/etc
to 
	export PATH=~/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/etc

in the future, you can put any programs in this directory and they will 
run instead of the ones with the equivalent names in /usr/local/bin (or 
any of the other directories in the path for that matter).  hope it is 
useful for you.  you might want to read it and see just how simple it is. :)

This is the key phrase. Many newsservers wont accept a post to a newsgroup
if you are qouting more lines of text than you, yourself, have written.
Mine, for example, just seems to count the number of lines starting with
">" and compares it with the number of lines that don't. A common dodge is
to replace all of those little ">" with something else like ":" or ";".
Some people have gone so far as to hack the pine code to make this
automatic. Hopefully, this will solve your problem.

Not that it is a problem to answer the above question when it is asked,
but this question *is* asked an awful lot. Maybe it is time for pine to
interface with vaction like it does with spell and the various other bits
of unix which it is uses to do its daily work of sending and receiving
mail. Would Pine Development consider this an unknowing feature request
from all of those people who wrote in questions just like this one over
the years?

Is there a way to reconstruct Pine mail folders and headers?  

While extracting/saving some messages from a large archive file, 
my system crashed and now I can't open the message folder.
The folder file is intact and I can read it fine as text, but Pine chokes
and is unable to open it.  Pine just reutrns the message "Folder xxx reopened"
where xxx is the previously opened folder.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

No, I'm not so stupid I don't know how to post a message.

The problem, I'm having is as follows:

case:

I am in a usenet newsgroup reading a posting from another user.
I want to edit and add something to that existing posting
I press the "R" reply key
The editor comes on screen
It asks post followup to newgroup ?
I answer yes
I then enter my text
After I finish I enter ^X to send
The system asks to send the message
I reply yes
The system says "may be posted to thousands of people
I reply yes
It then starts to write to Fcc
It then stops and says "error 411 more included in text than new"
message not sent

Now I notice I can post a Re: to that message that will be displayed in 
another folder if I answer NO to posting to "Follow up to newsgroup"
but if I answer yes to "follow up to newsgroup " the message won't be sent.

How come????

Please reply

MIME is not a file format but an encapsulation method.  As far as you are 
concerned, to add a document for encapsulation in a mail message via 
MIME, simply type the name of the document in the "Attchmnt:" header, it 
will be encoded for you.

Or, if you don't remember the name of the file, you can press ^T 
(control-T) and choose the file from a list.

The person at the other end will be able to extract the document from 
your mail message automatically if they are using Pine or another 
MIME-aware mail user agent.  If they are not, they can use the munpack 
utility to get at the data.

Okay. Your method works if you just compose a message and hit Ctrl-_ to 
invoke the non-existent editor, but if youi type vsh or bash as the first 
line of your message, THEN hit Ctrl-_ to "invoke external editor," then 
VOILA! you have a shell available.

If messages bounced to this machine within the last 48 hours it is 
because this method was used on us to invoke a fork bomb and shut down
our system.

Just as if someone posted the same article to two different newsgroups

I presume you are receiving MIMEd attachments that are not recognized by 
Pine as attachments.  This could be because the sending mail user agent 
(MUA) is not providing the necessary separator.

Anyway, you can save the MIMEd file and decode it using munpack.  If you 
need a copy of munpack, let me know and I will email you a copy attached 
to a Pine message.  Let me know if you need the SUN Unix or DOS version.

The present version of pine does not have the uudecode function built 
it.  You can read in a uuencoded file to pine using ^R and save a message 
with a uuencoded file using ^E (export).  You can uudecode files with a
single uuencoded file as part of the message by eporting the message to a 
file and typing 'uudecode <filename>' or piping the message from within 
Pine (if enabled) to uudecode, '| uudecode'

Hi!  I have over 3000 messages in my inbox.  I get mail from some
5 different mailing groups/lists as well as from several individuals
who write to me regularly.  I have two questions/requests for help.
I would be *eternally* grateful for any assistance! :)  I am hoping
for:

    1)  a script that will sort through my inbox as it stands now
        and put letters (in order from the first letters in to the
        last) from each group or individual specified in the script
        into a specified folder (i.e. all letters from the adoption
        mailing list into a folder called "adoption" and so on)

    2)  a script that will in future sort these things as they come
        in and send them to particular groups/mail folders where I
        can check on them at my leisure.  I cannot find anything in
        my email now and it is driving me nuts!!!  :(

Is any of this possible?  I tried a script for sorting beforehand that I
downloaded from here some long time back but could never get it to work.
Basically I would like to be able to, say, check my adoption mail, then
check my reptile mailing list, then check the unix stuff, etc.  I also
get regular letters from a niece and nephew that I want to make sure I
don't miss.  This means that some of the sorting has to be done by "Who
From" (i.e. my niece and/or nephew) and some has to look for the mailing
list title rather than an individual poster/sender.  Anyone?

Thank you very much for your time and kind attention!

You can't reply to me using the Reply feature in Pine, because if you 
try, the message will get sent to rallen@city.ba.k12.md.us instead of 
rallen@knight.city.ba.k12.md.us.  (Try it!)  Does anyone know where this 
information 
is stored?  There's nothing like that in my pine.conf file.  Should there 
be a line like Reply-To-Host=knight.city.ba.k12.md.us?  Is there 
something like that in another file?  We are a new site and are running 
Pine 3.91.

Thank you for replying (or at least trying).

We have users who, because they are evil little boys and girls and don't
delete their mail, have aliases sending their mail to their home directory
instead of the INBOX directory.  As part of the script that does this, the
MAIL environment variable is set, but PINE ignores it.  Most other mail
readers do not. 

Although this in itself is just an inconvenience, I modified
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf to set inbox-path to $MAIL.  Works fine _if_ MAIL is
set, but dumps otherwise.  Likewise, if MAIL is set but has no value, PINE
dumps. 

I don't know if this is a bug, but PINE should not simply ignore the MAIL
variable.  What we've had to do is either take each user who obviously
doesn't know what they're doing by the hand to fix the problem, or set
incoming-folders to include the new default mail folder. 

This is a problem for people who don't have the special mail folder, and just
makes the whole thing complicated all over again.  That's why we tried to get
people to use PINE in the first place, to avoid complication...

I heard a rumor to the effect that this is a known bug in Solaris 2.3 and
the fix is to upgrade to 2.4.  This is apocryphical; our only Solaris box
doesn't have a C compiler (and we avoid it anyway...).

just  a short answer:

Here on Unix-Pine it works fine and the most (UNIX-)machines answers right.

Hi!

Of course I can Save them, but automatically it would be nice.
My newsreader at home (AmigaOS) only shows new messages and
all or last 100, 50, 25 if I wish. An auto-move (or save) would
do it for pine. Optionally only for answered mails.

See you,

Readers,

I'm relatively new to the World of e-mail but having read a few letters I 
have noticed people have ended there messages with a signiture. I was 
wondering how do you go about creating one. Also is it possible to save 
messages that people have sent to you on floppy disc. If any one could 
help I would be most grateful. Thanks.

Hello Pine users,

   Is there anyone out there using PGP with Pine ?  There is a
hack for Elm which allows you to use PGP with it, but as we dont use
Elm, the same for Pine would be nice.  Any pointers/ideas would be
highly appreciated,

Cheers all,

There is no good way to determine that (1) is a misconfiguration, as
opposed to being a private TCP/IP network that isn't connected to Internet
and does not use DNS.  I speculate that there are many more TCP/IP
machines that are not on Internet than those which are.  If you just check
to see if h_name doesn't have a dot, you'll get a false positive.  You can
try running down the h_alias list and seeing if any alias names have dots
in them.  But you'll get a false negative if the FQDN isn't in /etc/hosts.

3.92 is going to have some form of guess/warning, although I wouldn't be
at all surprised if someone on a private net with a perfectly valid
configuration gets bit and flames us.

(2) is not a misconfiguration.  It is perfectly valid according to the
standards, which make it clear that the MUA is responsible for generating
the From: and Message-ID: header.  If sendmail on certain systems applies
a From: and/or Message-ID:, it is acting as part of the MUA (not MTA).

And, of course, all the world is not necessarily sendmail.

Yep, there's a purpose.  I often get mail from people whose email address 
I don't recognize, saying things like, "Yes, please do that for me."  I 
scratched my head and (before Pine) had to reply to the message saying "I 
don't remember what mail I sent out that you are responding to."

I've kept every piece of sent mail since April of 1989.  I don't often 
have to look at them, but when I do, it can be a lifesaver, since it's 
obviously something I've totally forgotten and needed to write down. :)

      What am I doing wrong or is there another way of doing this?

I recently downloaded the MSDOS version of Pine (pcpine_f.zip.  I don't 
have my own network, and access E-mail through my Unix account.  The only 
reason I wanted it was for the DOS version of the Pico editor, to use as 
my message editor in conjunction with the Blue Wave Offline Mail Reader.  
Those word-processing programs I would have chosen are too big to fit in 
memory, and the two alternatives, TED3 (The editor that comes with BW) 
and MSDOS's editor do not support the word-wrap, which leves me to worry 
about new lines while losing my train of thought while I write.

Now that I have it, this is my question:  I saw no documentation, and no 
license or registration form.  What status does PC-Pine have?  And also, 
since I deleted all files except Pico.exe, what would be the legal 
difference.  Even freeware usually has some stipulation, but I am unclear 
of what I am now expected to do.  Please let me know.  Thank you very much.

At my place of employment we have two mail systems.  The first is
pegasus on our Local Network.  The second is Pine mail (UNIX) on a Sun
computer.  We do not have access to a SLIP or a PPP connection.  We
have about 15 hookups to the Sun through a pad.  Is it possible to
compose a message in pegasus, queue that message, convert it to a Unix
format, upload the message to the Sun computer via kermit, and than
send the message through internet mail?   I know that this may be
complicated procedure and may not be possible, but if I can somehow
automate a procedure through a kermit script file we will have the
ability to do all of our mail with one mail system.

Hi All,

This is a really strange one.

I admin about 10 UNIX systems running PINE 3.91 and on my main host 
(where I send and receive most mail) I all of the sudden can't send any 
mail via PINE.

Other users on my system can send and receive mail, and I can still 
receive mail, but I can't send via pine.

If I use Mail, mail, or elm, the messages are delivered as expected.  I 
am using PC Eudora until I figure this out so please HELP!

My system is a Sun IPX with Solaris 2.4.  I am running sendmail 8.6.12 
but have also tried using the sendmail that was included with Solaris 
2.4.

Like I said, other users on this system can send mail from PINE just 
fine...  I'm at my end with this one.  I've even tried setting up another 
account for myself to send from with no luck.

This had been working forever, even with Sendmail 8.6.9 and 8.6.10 with 
no problems.

Any advice will be appreciated,

Gregg Brekke

Set a name for the "read-message-folder" variable.
Select the "auto-move-read-msgs" feature.

Whilst you are playing around with Pine you might like to try and get a 
correct address stamped on your outgoing messages.  I don't somehow think 
that this message is going to reach you directly using the 
"bsfolgma@track" address quoted on oyur original query!

You're right. It ain't about pine. *however*, I did get the mail 
filtering FAQ which pointed me to procmail from the archive for 
this group. Close enuf ? 

Anywho, procmail does not want to work for me today. (never has, I'm
setting it up now for the first time)  In following the cookbook, 
it says to check the log file for messages. Good idea, except the 
specified logfile is not being created.

I've tried several incantations and configurations for the .procmailrc
and .forward file, to no avail. Has anyone else seen similar behavior ?

It looks like .forward is not getting accessed. I've opened my home dir
and .forward up, making everything searchable and executable. 

Our mail environment is vanilla SunOS 4.1.3_U1.

Any hints ?

TIA

Hi Stephen,
I attached for you three files:
1. rc.maillists
	you can look at the sample I made in it which suppose to filter 
all the incoming messages from pine-info mailing list.  You have to make 
a directory in your home directory called ".procmail".
2. .forward is also a need file, place your user-name instead of user-name.
3. .procmailrc

make sure procmail is in your path.
if you are still confused write me back and I will try to be more clear.

While I am at it, where are the mail-server faqs stored/posted?

My apologies. It appears that headers which have text after the colon such
as what the original post proposed go out whether or not you hit ^R -- or
at least that has been my experience this evening. ^R is only necessary if
you put in a header but not text after it, such as

	Return-Receipt-To: 

rather than 

	Return-Receipt-To: xx@yy.zz

The first you would use (in conjunction with ^R) if you plan to get a 
receipt sometimes on specific pieces of mail in the future. The second 
you would set up, if you want *every* piece of mail that you send to send 
a receipt to xx@yy.zz. Please let me know if these are not the facts, as 
I don't want to spread any misinformation.

I've attached mpack and munpack (sun executables) and corresponding man

If you're running a mail-news gateway, it'd better NOT be the same ID.
In fact, you should be creating an entirely new one.  If one message
is sent to two or more mail-news gateways and goes through each one
with message-id preserved, but to different newsgroups or sets of
newsgroups, the multiple copies will interfere with each others'
propagation.

I am (by default) the PINE administrator.  I've compiled PINE 3.91 and have
made it available for our users to use.  I'd like to know how I can set up a
global addressbook, which will be looked at by any user, whenever they want to.
Can this global addressbook be looked at by PINE at the same time that it looks
at the user's local addressbook?

This is all to take place on UNIX.

Nancy,
PC-Pine is currently most comfortable having a network connection (used
for remote folder access, authentication before sending, and actually
sending).  As you've heard before, true offline support will be coming
in a future release.

In the meantime, *if* you configure PC-Pine to have a local folder
collection (as the first one listed), then you can use the -f flag to open
that folder without PC-Pine trying to access the remote inbox over the
net.  In the future there will be a way to access a *local* folder even
when the default folder collection is specified to be on a remote server.

The trick is that you have to hit ^R for Rich Hdr (cursor in the header
area) when composing a message in order to activate your extra header.
Note that I have (temporarily) added above the extra nonsense header,

	Random-Hdr: Gratuitous Text

to illustrate this point, although if you look carefully, you may notice 
a few others above. (I am curious to see if anything will go wrong, 
actually.) You can either install it as you have done, or do it through 
Setup/Config in the main menu of pine. Either way works fine. 

				Good Luck!

We use BW tcp/ip at McMaster . I installed pine3.0 (windowish version)
without problem as I recall last summer . I did have a problem with
previous dos versions of pcpine (going by my memory here). It had to do
with BW software not vacating the tcpip stack when it was finished and
perhaps pcpine needing to use the it but couldn't cos BW was still there .
I had this with pcdos gopher clients too.  The windows pcpine works (
3.90) fine with BW version 3.0c (I think current BW version is 3.2 )
. Can't speak for Pine 3.91 PC/windows


Hope this helps .

Ian,
We are interested in this problem, but the solution needs to encompass
client-server email architectures as well as single-host environments.
Since there are no protocol standards specifically for this function,
we need to decide whether to try to pervert IMSP or IMAP for this use, or
use email robot servers, or use X.500, or "something completely different".

When I use programme 'tin' for newsgroups it lets me know any new groups 
and whether I want to subscribe to them.
Can I turn a similar feature on in 'pine' ?.

I have the same problem.  I think it's the fact that wy50 have a problem
with reverse video (It takes up a character space to turn it on and off).
I need to get this working also.

Subject: Pine hanging
Status: O
X-Status: 

Does anyone know how to solve this problem?

Pine V3.91 on my IBM RS/6000 with AIX V3.2.5 is hanging while writing the fcc.
I get the "Writing fcc..." status message, then it just hangs.  I eventually
have to kill the process.  It also hangs when I attempt to save a message.

I tried deleting all my config stuff (.pinerc) but that did not help.  Also,
it only happens to my user id!  And it just started happening during the 
middle of a normal day.  No recompiles or anything like that happened.

I don't have any of the fancy mailbox stuff set up and have all the folders
in my /home/don/mail directory.  There is no network access of folders
defined.

Your input is greatly appreciated.

Assuming this is a misconfiguration, and recalling earlier discussion,
we now have a list of two common misconfigurations:

1. gethostbyname() system call does not return fully-qualified domain
   name.
2. Mail transport agent does not correctly insert From: line and/or
   message id.

A possible attempt to work around misconfiguration 1 would be:

   if (host name does not contain a dot) and (userdomain is defined) then
      append a dot and userdomain to host name
   end if

The code needed to work around 2 must be more complex than that.

Pine goes to some trouble to work around 2, but not 1.  I assume this
was a design decision.  It would be interesting, useful, and
informative, to know why.  I have always found it educational to
understand the reasoning behind decisions made by software designers.

The Filtering Mail FAQ is accessible from:

I don't know if Netcom has procmail installed, but I'd like to find out 
so please let us know.

After digging around a little more, I found the d-g port (duh!), although 
it was reporting an error (didn't know the size of times) in osdep.c

I simply added

#include <utime.h>

to the top of the os_d-g.h header file, and all went well.

I'm looking for something that will convert Listserv mail logs and other

Does such a beast exist?

This distinction is unimportant.  The only reason for using a domain
format name without using DNS is a future expectation of using DNS.

This is irrelevant.  Whether or not it is "good policy", it is perfectly
valid for a private network not to use domain names.  It is much more
typical for a private network to be domainless, no matter what you or I
may feel about "good policy".

News has nothing to do with this.  Anyway, you don't use Pine for news, so
it shouldn't bother you.

Certain individuals claimed (incorrectly) that a message ID without a FQDN
was invalid, and (correctly) that such a message ID was more likely to
have false matches.

It is one thing to say that a system on a domain-using network is
misconfigured if the FQDN is not returned by gethostbyname().  It is quite
another to say that it is misconfigured if the FQDN isn't a meaningful
concept.

In a domainless private network, that is about as meaningful as saying
"and then you tell them to blurdybloop the sarasoop".

Yes they do, but as I understand it, if you want to use it with Pine you 
have to use it through an elm filter.

[A little bit of an adventuring spirit would have led you in the right 
direction assuming you're using Pine 3.91...]

If you have Pine 3.91 the Main Menu clearly shows a "Setup" option (S).  
Using this then lets you alter the Configuration (C).

There are lots of interesting items in this screen that can be altered to 
affect Pine's behaviour.  In particular one is called "customized-hdrs".  

If you put your cursor on this item and ask for help by typing "?" (it's 
on the menu at the bottom of the screen) you'll be told about what it's 
for, how to use it, and how to include a value for any extra headers you add.

Any headers you add like this will not normally be shown to you when 
composing a message (but they ARE setup nevertheless).  To see/alter them 
type Ctrl/R with your cursor in the header section of the message.

Alternatively you can set up which headers you normally want to see (the 
default headers), again in the Setup Configuration screen.

turn on the "enable-aggregate-command-set" option.

Go back to your news index.  Then type:
	;AAD

This means Select (;) All messages (A) and Apply (A) a Delete (D) command 
to them.

Note that Select also allows you to choose messages by other criteria.

Also there is a "Z" (Zoom) command which hides unselected messages from 
the list, allowing you to concentrate on those you have picked.

In the system-side configuration file (probably the "fixed" one that 
users can't override) include the "disable-config-cmd" feature in the 
feature-list variable's list of values.  You may also want to consider 
some of the following too:

	disable-keyboard-lock-cmd
	disable-password-cmd
	disable-update-cmd

Which is something that takes a deliberate effort to do, as opposed to
sending a message to two mailing lists that have gateways which is very
easy to do accidentally.

Hello everyone,

I have a running version of the Pine version 3.91, although I did not test 
everything in it. It has been compiled by gcc that can be found on the CD 
that you can request from SCO free of charge. You need to make only small 
changes to the source code of the Pine in order to make it compile. If some 
of you would like, I can send you the binaries (pine and pico, I am not 
using anything else) in uuencoded format in e-mail. I am not a member of 
this list, so send me a direct mail.

Any suggestions on how to do this?  Is there a "find-and-replace"

At my place of employment we have two mail systems.  The first is
pegasus on our Local Network.  The second is Pine mail (UNIX) on a Sun
computer.  We do not have access to a SLIP or a PPP connection.  We
have about 15 hookups to the Sun through a pad.  Is it possible to
compose a message in pegasus, queue that message, convert it to a Unix
format, upload the message to the Sun computer via kermit, and than
send the message through internet mail?   I know that this may be
complicated procedure and may not be possible, but if I can somehow
automate a procedure through a kermit script file we will have the
ability to do all of our mail with one mail system.

That sounds fine to me.
 
But, it would be polite to check first with your recipients to make
sure that they can actually read the messages!
 
Even if they use PINE (and there are some people out there that
don't), it is not guaranteed that they have a terminal that
displays (or is correctly set up to display) characters in the
upper half of the 8-bit code table.
 
As the saying goes - "be pessimistic in what you send out, and
generous in interpreting what you receive".

Well, the subject says it all.  every time i run pine, i get some 
.pine-debug files.  i tried running pine with the d0 parameter, but then 
it wouldn't quit, and i have to ctrl-c to get out.  i expect it's 
probably a problem in the code somewhere (it was compiled for BSD by the 
way), but if anyone's found a way around it, i'd like to know.  it's kind 
of annoying.  and if you could mail me, that would be better, since my 
news server is anti-comp.mail.pine, and only gets the groups when it 
feels like it.

I don't have an account at Netcom, so you might want to take this with a grain
of salt, but as far as I know:
- Netcom has procmail installed, albeit a rather outdated version.
- It can be used by simply setting up a .forward file as in the manpages.
- There is a user-maintained newer version of procmail installed somewhere.

Hi,

Pine has just been installed on the system I currently use. On the system I 
used to use, the .sig file was included _after_ included replies (which made 
sense) but here its included _before_ (which looks odd, imho).

How do I change the relative inclusion positions of the replied-to mail and
 my .sig file ? I've looked in the .pinerc & pine.conf files, and there's
nothing obvious ...

Grateful for any help ...

Ben

Hi!  Everyday  when I check my mail,  I (E)xport  a selective bunch of
msgs into one file (today I called it 0608).  It usually contains info
from  one specific mail-list  (various news) and   later on I printout
that file.  My suggestion is, that in  the Config area, an option will
be  added for "Appended text  will be precedeeded by  a form-feed".  I
mean, I'd like each message to start on a new  page. Right now, I have
to manually add  ^L's before  every  new appended message to  the same
file.  It's really a pain in the arse.

If you  think this is  a good idea, please  follow-up and say so!  The
more people think this feature to be valuable,  the higher the chances
are of it being implemented.

Thanks a million,

Ron.

Message-Id: <3q2qp9$1k6@detroit.freenet.org>

Hi

We have a restricted, not chroot I *must* add, environment where users
can only execute programs in /usr/local/rbin.  This includes Pine, Lynx
their menus, cp, rm etc etc.  Users execute Pine from a menu - so typing
a number spawns /usr/local/rbin/pine.  Everything works like a charm
except for spell (^T).  We have tried moving /usr/bin/spell into
/usr/local/rbin (as well as all the programs used by spell) but still
no cigar.  When ^T is invoked Pine simply echoes back "Done Checking
Spelling" with no corrections made.  When I run Pine in a command tool I
see "sh: /usr/bin/spell: restricted" - this does not surprise me as we
are not giving users access to /usr/bin!!!!

Now, what I need is some good advice on how to make Pine look for 'spell'
in the users path NOT by looking for /usr/bin/spell.  Has anyone hacked
the source successfully (we tried that too) ?? Or can any Pine developers
who read this group explain where I would change the code.

Please help.

Hey, Fellow Pine Users:

I have gotten a couple of files E-mailed to me from Macintosh users that
show up in BINHEX4.0 format.  These files are Excel5.0 spreadsheets and
Word4.0 documents. 

After detaching them from the pine message and saving them in my home
directory (on a Sun system) I have tried to convert them back to Excel &
Word files using the "mcvert" (using various combinations of the "-"
options) utility. It converts them to a file which I then rename them to a
compatible "MS-DOS" filename and upload them to my PC. 
 
Neither Excel or Word will load them!  I have even purchased a commercial
data translator software package (DataViz V2.5) which read/writes Mac
disks/files on my PC with no problems. It however doesn't do BINHEX4.0.  I
have tried to figure this out with no success.  I know this can be done. 
If someone could send me instructions/procedures of what they are doing it
would great. 

Am I losing something in the files by transferring them from 
Mac-->Sun-->MsDos O/S's ?

Any help would greatly appreciated! 
Thanks!

I built pine-3.91 from the source on a Linux box.  One of changes I
made to the source was to use ispell instead of spell.  All that
need to be changed was the file pico/os_unix.h.  Specifically, on
line 137 I changed the macro SPELLER to:

  #define SPELLER "/usr/bin/ispell -u"

You should be set this to whatever directory you like.

You should find that there's an option "signature-at-bottom" somewhere in 
your .pinerc file, in the feature-list section.  Just check that, and 
presto, the signature appears at the bottom!

an automatic way to use pine (or any mime supported mailers) to
correspond in 8-bit charset (eg, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, etc) mail 
with users who only have uuen/decode, is to email via the mime/uuencode 
gateway, in this format:

login.name%host.name%uue@mmd.csie.nctu.edu.tw

eg, cyl%ifcss.org%uue@mmd.csie.nctu.edu.tw

Your reply-to address will automatically be in the format

login.name%host.name%mme@uud.csie.nctu.edu.tw

so that the reply will come back in mime format so you can read it 
directly in pine w/o having to pipe it to uudecode.

The good news is that I am working on the NNTP support code in the IMAP-4
toolkit now, and I *will* be implementing the authentication stuff.

I don't know at the present time whether or not this will make it into
Pine 3.92 since it'll probably require retrofitting the authentication
code into the IMAP-3.6 toolkit (which I'm trying to freeze -- as in every
change made to IMAP-3.6 delays IMAP-4 further).  Probably not; but a final
decision hasn't been made yet.

The 5 Step Guide to Hacking a pine-based account

1.  Press 1 on the menu to go to pine
2.  Type S then C to configure pine
3.  Go to the bottom and A add vi to be your alternate editor
4.  Exit config, go to compose a message, press ^_ to go to vi.
5.  Type Escape :set shell=/bin/sh  then Escape :shell

Boom!... You now are in a shell. This works on lots of mail accounts 
assuming you can get a password, easy to do with Crack and the 
/etc/passwd file.

I would think that the reason that Pine doesn't use FQDN in some
message id's is rather important in a discussion about why Pine
doesn't use FQDN in some message id's. It isn't an issue of DNS, it
is an issue of how the system is named. 

>The only reason for using a domain

Or so that software that needs it can have it.

Right. And just why is it we are caring if private networks are
generating bad message id's? It seems that the problem becomes a problem
when those networks aren't private anymore. 

>News has nothing to do with this.  Anyway, you don't use Pine for news, so

Right. I'll just start saying "screw anyone who hasn't a proper message
id and just drop their messages on the floor".

>Certain individuals claimed (incorrectly) that a message ID without a FQDN

Since the RFC specifies "unique", "more likely to have false matches"
means that it doesn't meet the RFC specifications.

1) FQDN is meaningfull for private networks. 2) I didn't say it was
misconfigured.

Malarky. Private networks are just as capable of having domain names as
are "public" ones. "Not needed except for certain things" is not the
same as "meaningless".

I have been using Pine for several months on a RISC 6000 running AIX 3.2.
Most of my users (accounts) experience no  problems...but for some users,
at various times, when they go to compose a message, the program hangs
at the to name prompt.  It's really strange...sometimes it works, other
times it hangs...I cann't seem  to find a pattern.
I'll admit, I don't know much about configuring pine.  I compiled it and
pico.  I don't have a pine.conf...each user has a .pinerc file.
I'm not using imap (using pop3)...is imap necessary?
 
Any help would be appreciated!  I would really like to use pine as our
campus mail program, if I could just get around this "hanging" up
problem.

I am slipping to the internet in the following way:

1) call into a local university and connect to my unix account using trumpet  
    winsock TCPMAN
2) run TIA-SLIP program (makes modified SLIP capability through UNIX shells)

My email comes in through a vax/vms account at the same university.  When I 
call and connect to the vax, without slipping, I can type PINE to access my 
mail.  I would like to be able to configure PC-Pine to do the same yet I have 
been unsuccesful.  Has anyone set up PC-Pine using a TIA-SLIP slip interface? 
 And, if not, any basic setup help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance for the help.

This is a followup to a previous message I sent to the list.

Has anyone using Pine on a system running AIX (particularly AIX 3.2.5) 
experienced particular problems?  Responses from both users and systems 
administrators are welcome at my e-mail address (below), or to the group 
if you feel responses are of general interest.

The local system administrator refuses to install Pine on our AIX 
machines because he claims that it will cause extra work for him and his 
staff.  I don't believe it, and neither have others.  Is Pine an 
administrative bear?

Right now the system is running Z-Mail, a hideous commerical product 
which is without an online manual and is a pain to use and customize.  
Pine (or anything) would be better than this.

Thanks in advance.

        I have just experienced yet another unhappy encounter 
with what is currently my biggest complaint, by far, against 
the Pine newsreader program.  Is there any easy way for me to 
abort the opening, and seemingly eternal sorting process, of a 
folder which I am not interested in viewing?  At least once a 
week, I find myself accidentally hitting return an extra time, 
when I hit return to show all of the newsgroups to which I am 
a subscriber.  What makes this really bad, is that the first 
newsgroup in my list is alt.2600.  As of just a few minutes 
ago, there were over fourteen hundred messages in that folder, 
here at IDS.  Fortunately this incident happened at Six-thirty 
on a Saturday morning.  Most of my encounters with this damned 
problem tend to happen when the system is at its busy slowest.  
There is nothing more annoying to me, than to sit waiting for 
several minutes, while I am forced watch the Pine newsreader 
program totally waste my time, with the seemingly endless 
sorting of a news folder that I am not at all interested in 
viewing.  How do I abort this problem in the future?  Please 
do let me know if there is an easy solution.

Can anyone suggest a way of stopping pine from adding the @domain name to the

Hi

I have two problems which concern attachments which are not MIME.

HOW DO I SEND AND READ NON-MIME ATTACHMENTS ????

- I find attachments a very practical thing and I would like to use it also for
sensding ASCII files (PostScript for instance) to people who are not able to
decode MIME. You will certainly tell me to use ^R and read the file, but as I
said attachments are very partical for me when I wirte the mail and they
indicate clearly to the recipient what type of file is included.

- From  time to time I receive normal ASCII mails where PINE tels me that the
text is in an attachment, but as it is ASCII I am not able to view it. I have
to save the entire mail and read from UNIX the file. 

I use PINE version 3.91 and I have other problems such as handeling folders
which contain a lot of messages (more than 200). Things get very very slow when
the folders are large and it takes up a lot of disc space. Wouldn't it be
possible to compress folders and only keep a table of content? One could also
use another format for storing the mails, a format with direct access
possibilities.

PINE is a wonderful toll and I would like to see it evolve. Many thanks to the
PINE development team.

	Best regards

It isn't really a question of using DNS or not. It is a question of
whether the network uses a domain name or not. And private networks are
quite capable of having a domain name. It is a good policy to HAVE such
a name, for the day when the network is no longer isolated from the net.

Since the problem is one of message id's that show up in news, then
saying "the network isn't connected" is incorrect.

And then you tell them to set their domain name.

Fully 80% of our users (16000+ accounts) use pine for their mail interface
because of its ease of use.  The only major problem caused by this is its
use of memory (about 1.2MB minimum, plus the size of the mailbox).  It has
not been an administrative problem at all with the excpetion that it has
increased our mail traffic by being easier for the beginning users to use. 

It installed with little difficulty and provide a host of configurable 
options for both the user and the administrator.  It also provides an 
easy to use NETNews interface for both reading and posting news (version 
3.91).

        I've been there!  Done that too!  
Had to hang two consecutive jobs in a row, 
just a couple of days ago.  One of them 
stayed online for several hours, before it 
was killed by the systems people.

There does not seem to be any point to continuing this discussion any

Me and some other analysts at work are fed up with vi.  I was
wondering if someone might have a compiled binary for System V R4,
or know where I can find one.  Our Sysadmin thinks vi is wonderful
so he won't  help us.  I've used Pico at school and it's definitely better.
All help is appreciated.

Thanks.......Rob

Re: dot forward and INBOX

I want to receive my mail at two e-mail locations.  One for day time and
one for evenings.  I have been successful by using a simple .forward
command file in my user directory.

Only problem is that I can not forward my mail directly to my INBOX.  I
have to chose another file name for these messages.

No big deal, but it would be nice if I could get my mail in the INBOX
location so that I do not have to change folders every time I open pine.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Gerald

Whether it is easy or not, the fact that it can be done accidentally

on a shell account (unix).  Thanks in advance.

    Each time you postpone a message, a blank line is added to the end
of the message.  Normally this isn't a problem since you wouldn't be
postponing a message over and over again, and blank lines at the end
of a message usually aren't noticed.  I thought I'd point that out
anyway... no doubt a trivial fix (haven't looked at the source yet,
myself).

This was a problem for us a long time ago and was solved by linking the 
program with termcap instead of curses.  The only problem with that 
solution is that the default termcap on AIX is pretty barebones, but you 
can easily find a good one on some ftp sites out there.
>From what I can tell, the problem may have been solved using the version 
3.6 of the imap distribution (this does not mean using the imap daemon, 
the imap dist. is what goes in the c-client directory and what builds the 
c-client library), but I haven't tested it for sure as termcap works fine 
for us.

/usr/ucb/hostname always returns the same as uname -n. After all, take a look
at it, it's a shell script!

But the Solaris 2.4 gethostbyname() does correctly return the FQDN. Only in
Solaris 2.3 (and possibly earlier) does the problem occur.

If it does not occur when using NIS, then it must depend on the access method,
which means the bug might be in nss_dns.so.1. On the other hand, It also
occurs when using files, so maybe it's in both nss_dns.so.1 and
nss_files.so.1 but not in nss_nis.so.1. Who knows?

Well, you can hack PINE, like I did, but that's not really a solution. You
can also upgrade to Solaris 2.4.

Follow ups to comp.unix.solaris.

Hey All...
	
	I would like to forward all my Mail in PINE (v3.91) to another 
account.  Rather than forward it so that I get a whole bunch of mail 
from myself, I would like to bounce it. so that in the FROM entry, the 
original sender is maintained.  Now, I know that with ^-; one can mark 
files.  But in marking the files, BOUNCE is not one of the options.. 
FORWARD is.  If anyone has any ideas, please tell me ASAP via email if 
you please :) Thanks for your time!

It seems to be looking for a specific file... on my system, at least.  
Couldn't we provide that file?  I'm curious as too why my system-admin 
people haven't put in a dummy file.  What are the reason pine produces a

DOes anybody happen to know how I could automatically group incoming

I heard something about a program 'procmail' but I have no idea where I 
could find it.

Thank you very much,

Subject: PINE, please don't generate headers

Message-Id: <3q5kll$5pa@ocean.CAM.ORG>
Status: O
X-Status: 

Quite a while ago, I noticed that the message IDs of the messages coming
from PINE do not use the FQDN of the sending host. The reason? It does
a simple uname() call (or something similar, I forget) to fetch the
node name, which is not the FQDN.

I left this alone because it's not a big deal. But IMHO it would be better
to not generate any such headers and leave the task to the MTS. That's how
it works with most/all other MUAs.

Recently, I ran into the same problem with From: lines. Not all of our
users live under the same domain name. We have some which are mapped to
other names (different domain name, possibly different username) using
sendmail 8.6.x's userdb facility. Our mail configuration accomodates
this well. But PINE insists on slapping a constant string on the end of
the username.

The solution I've used for both problems is the same: supress the
generation of the Message-ID: and From: headers in outgoing mail & news.

Why doesn't PINE work that way in the first place? It doesn't make sense
for the MUA to compute the correct values of those headers. It makes many
MUAs to configure when we could get away with only configuring the MDA.
Not to mention complex configurations supported by sendmail but not
some or all MUAs!

My 2 cents...

If anyone is interested in my patches to pine-3.91 to supress these
headers (including the implementation of posting via inews since it was
previously unimplemented), mail me.

   I presume you are receiving MIMEd attachments that are not recognized by 
   Pine as attachments.  This could be because the sending mail user agent 
   (MUA) is not providing the necessary separator.

   Anyway, you can save the MIMEd file and decode it using munpack.  If you 
   need a copy of munpack, let me know and I will email you a copy attached 
   to a Pine message.  Let me know if you need the SUN Unix or DOS version.

Here's an additional hint we have added to our local copy of the
munpack(1) man page:

     NOTES
          If a MIME message is forwarded using a non-MIME compliant
          mailer, its MIME encoding will not be recognized.  To fix
          this, save the message as a file and edit the file.  Look for
          the first Content-Type: mail header, and copy that header into
          the first "paragraph" of mail headers, somewhere after its
          first line.

Hello, 

We are currently re-evaluating our policy for handling email.  We have a large

old/large mailboxes.  I am trying to gather information regarding other
large/similar sites.  If you can take just a couple of minutes to answer the
following, I would greatly appreciate it.  I would be happy to collect and
summarize responses if there is interest.

This is using the default of IMAP on port 143, not pop3 or port 110...

The customized-hdrs option was not implemented until Pine 3.90, please ask
your system administrator to upgrade to the current Pine 3.91 release...

The default is for Pine to _always_ produce and keep the last four
.pine-debug files.

I have read in various FAQ's that it is possible to post to a limited 
geographic area.  I just posted to misc.wanted, and I was hoping that 
PINE would allow me to limit my posting to my local area, but it didn't.  
Did I miss a switch somewhere?  I'd really appreciate some help as I do 
not want to pollute everyone's newgroup lists with worthless messages.

Thanks,

Mark Belles

Hallo!

  I've just found that if I received mail which is addressed directly to=20
me but the To: line spawns into two lines and my address=20
(<vs@utia.cas.cz>) is at the second line, pine doesn't display the plus=20
sign indicating the mail is directly for me (in difference from the mail=20
from a mailing list). This should be corrected in pine 3.92 because the=20
long names will be more often (as David Miller promissed, RFC 1522 WILL=20
be implemented ...). So this is a suggestion for the pine team and a=20
warning for others ...

Regards

     V. S.

  In the simtel archives there is a program called "readmail" that
  will allow you to read *and* manipulate pine folders without
  needing to convert them to pc ascii.

  It is not an offline mailer... reads mail but can not "send"
  mail.
  What I do, when can't have direct connection with my host... is to
  download (from a friend's machine) all my inbox... then read it
  and manipulate it with readmail, and if I need to write... I do
  use "pico" for pc... compose the mail... and then I upload and
  when in pine (unix) use the ^R (read file)... Clunky but
  effective.

  Waiting for the day that pine *is* an offline mailer :)

Hello PINEers --

I am running pine on an Alpha 3300 w/OSFv2.  I'm connecting to my alpha
via Kermit (v.99) on my Macintosh IIcx running system 7.0.1. When I print
a message to "attached-to-ansi" I then issue to  "print captured text"
command from kermit.  Kermit then tells "Printing is being terminated
because there is not enough memory."   When this happens I still have 
5055 unused blocks of memory.  (5 meg).  Has anyone else had this problem?
Any ideas??

Thanks for any suggestions!!!

Try allocating more memory to Kermit using "Get Info." Or do you have 
32-bit addressing turned on? just some things to look for...

Hello ppls,
 
   Can someone please tell me how to change my name that is attached 
to my mail?  I assume it is a setenv command such as IRCNAME but do 
not know what it is.  I can change my name permanentyl using the 
"chfn" and "chpass" command but would like to be able to change it 
so it just effects my e-mail.  Any suggestions would be 
appreciated.  Thanx in advance.

The Pine/Pico sources for AIX 3.2.5 don't compile cleanly under AIX 4.1.  
If you have a 3.2.5 box around, compile it on that box and move the 
binaries; otherwise, get a copy of the 3.2.5 binaries available as
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin/*.a32.

Whenever i trie to add a new folder i get the following error message:
  Can't create mailbox #mh/newfolder: No such file or directory

I posted this one time before, but i never got any helpful answer (well.. one of the developers said that the problem wasn't in his part of the code...)

Hi,

I have recently loaded pine 3.91 onto our UnixWare 1.1 system for a
colleague.  However, after a week or so of pine appearing to work
ok, it now does not send out *any* mail, although there is no error
(pine seems to think that it is OK), and worse, no evidence of the
mail anywhere :-(.   Elm, mailx etc seem to be working fine.

Anyone any ideas ?

Hi,

  Would it be possible to let the user specify the login names Pine should
use for each of the INBOXes it's checking for mail ? With PC Pine you just
give your login name for the "main" INBOX folder and it's used for all others
INBOXes you might want to check with Pine too... each time you have to give
both login and password, it would be nice to be able to give the login name
for each IMAP server within the Setup (pinerc) file.

	I DID find an option for customized-hdrs in the .pinerc file, 
toward the end, but I can't get it to work.  I filled it it so that it
read as follows: customized-hdrs=Reply-to=   , and when I then ask for
rich headers, a reply-to line appears for me to fill in, but when I do,
it doesn't work.  I've tried several times to several different addresses,
including a list on which I've used the Reply-to feature successfully in
the past (from a different account).  Is there something I'm overlooking?
Do I need to enclose something in quotation marks?  I've tried to read
online help info and as many past messages from this newsgroup as I have
access to, but I'm still stumped.

	I'd appreciate help.

Sorry, I took so long responding to the requests for the info on how to 
modify UNIX (non-DOS) PICO to allow for foreign character input. 

As has been pointed out to me by some of the respondents to my original post
, using this modification from within PINE to try and send mail with accented
characters can result in mixed results. Not all computers on the Internet
will pass on 8 bit characters in mail messages. Consequently, these characters
will sometimes get sent without there 8th bit causing lost characters. In our
environment we have no problem sending mail with 8 bit characters 
internally, but your mileage may vary. All the machines in our 
environment are set for 8 bit. 

One way to solve this 8 bit - 7 bit problem is to create your mail 
message in pico (outside of PINE) UUENCODE or ROT it and mail the 
resulting file. At least now you will be able to enter all your 
foreign characters into PICO.


The following modifications were made to the pico.c program found in version
3.91 of Pine.

Beginning at line 372

Old Code
========

#ifdef	DOS
    if (c>=0x20 && c<=0xFF) {
#else
    if ((c>=0x20 && c<=0x7E) || (c>=0xA0 && c<=0xFE)) { /* Self inserting.  */ 
#endif

New Code
========
#ifdef	DOS
    if (c>=0x20 && c<=0xFF) {
#else
    if ((c>=0x20 && c<=0x7E) || (c>=0x80 && c<=0xFE)) { /* Self inserting.  */ 
#endif

As you can see the only difference is in the #else line. I changed the 0xA0 to
0x80. I am not sure why the range containing most of the foreign characters 
was purposefully excluded, but I included them and have had no problems.

Make sure you are setting the "smtp-server=" variable to the fqdn of your 
mail server/forwarder in the .pinerc file.

I am running Solaris 2.4 and UnixWare, both of these systems can't send 
mail from Pine without this variable set.  There is probably a better way 
to fix this through a code patch, but this seems to solve the problem.

Later,
Gregg

  Hi guys,
	I have got the executables programs of "pine" and "pico" from
"ftp.cac.washington.edu" for work on Sequent Systems with Dynix/ptx
V4.x.x, I don't have problems with "pico" but when I execute "pine", it
send me a message like : 

	"who are you? (unable to look up login name)"

	I don't know if this program was compiled under a standard
environment or I have to do something more... The useraccounts work with
ksh, and csh; and variables like "$USER", "$LOGNAME" are initialized
correctly... 

	Why "pine" send me this message..??? I hope this question is not a
FAQ, if is it, really sorry, I'm not subscribed in this list... then
please, reply me directly.... 

  Thank's in advance...

I'd just like to make a feature request for the next version of pine.

It would be nice if there could be an option when posting/replying to 
newsgroups to allow it to make the post e-mail style instead of NNTP 
style.  For example, the way news reading is set up here, anyone from our 
domain can read news, however, only people from specific "secured" ip 
address can directly post.  People not at these "secured" ip address can 
post by sending their post to:  INSERT_NEWSGROUP_NAME@NEWSSERVER_ADDRESS 
(where they then do some verification a post the message).  So if you're 
looking to add a convenient feature, allowing this method of newsgroup 
posting would be nice.  (ie. when I type compose from within a newsgroup, 
it files in the "To:" line based on the above rule.)

	Jerry

 They MUST, or else it's just an invalid header line.

How do you set up Pine so that once an article in a news
folder is read, it doesn't show up with the N(new) flag
the next time I open that folder in a new session?  It
would also be nice if the cursor jumped to the next unread
message upon entering the folder.

Try

    Reply-To:

in place of:

    Reply-to=

The equals sign, if that is what you entered, could be bollixing things 
up.  Header field names commonly end with a colon.

Subject: creating other INBOXes
Date: 14 Jun 1995 02:14:52 GMT
Message-Id: <3rlgms$nu@mail.one.net>
Status: O
X-Status: 


    Is it possible to create several INBOX folders with PINE? I have 
mailing list of sorts that I'd like to get hooked up to again, but it 
usualy echoes 1 message to me every 30 seconds. You can imagine what my 
regular INBOX folder would look like when I check my mail in the morning. 
Basically I want to create a new folder, called INBOX2 for instance, that 
only takes in mail from one address, in this case the mailing list's 
address. Furthermore, I don't want the messages appearing in the other 
folders at all, just this new one. Is there away to do that with PINE?

Yes, here's an example from my .pinerc (you can do this from the setup
but it's a pain)
incoming-folders="Word-Server" Mail/wordserver,
	"Ascii-Art" Mail/asciiart,
	"Figlet" Mail/figlet,
	"MS Word for PC" Mail/msword,
	"New-List List" Mail/newlist,
	"Wordly" Mail/wordly,
	"Procmail" Mail/procmaillist,
	"HTML-List" Mail/htmllist,
	"HTML Guild" Mail/htmlguild,
	"Chess" Mail/chess

All my mail is sorted by procmail.
I just use TAB to switch :-)

 According to the Pine help only the Deleted flag is kept between 
sessions (because of the way .newsrc stores info). Surprisingly, many of 
the groups I read actually show only the unread articles as New - but 
some, like c.m.p lose this information! Any explanation by the wizards?

This is because you have a feature turned on (not on by default) called 
"news-approximates-new-status".  What happens is this:

It is quite true that only the "Deleted" status flag can be recorded by 
Pine between sessions.  This gets stored in the normally formatted 
".newsrc" file that is also used by other news reading programs.

Other programs divide articles into only two classes: "Seen" and 
"Unseen".  The list held in the .newsrc file lists the "seen" articles.  
These are not normally included in any list of articles you are shown.

Pine attempts to adopt a strategy more akin to e-mail by dividing 
articles into three classes: deleted ("finished with"); seen and unseen 
("new").  Pine's "deleted" is equivalent to a conventional news reader's 
"seen" in that these articles are not by default included in the list 
shown to you.

Both "seen" and "unseen" articles *are* shown in the list to you.  But 
how can Pine store the three classes using a storage (.newsrc file) 
mechanism that only permits two to be saved?

The answer is by using a bit of intelligent guesswork.

Firstly Pine excludes all the "deleted" articles from its list of all 
articles in a newsgroup.

Without the "news-approximates-new-status" feature set all of these are 
displayed as "New".

But *with* the "news-approximates-new-status" feature set Pine checks for 
the date and time of the most recent article that has been Deleted.  It 
then *assumes* that you have read all articles up to that date and time 
(as you must have had them available to see the one you *did* delete) and 
further assumes that all subsequent articles have arrived since.  The 
former are displayed as "read"; the latter as "new".

This falls down a little if you have read some articles after the last 
one you deleted (perhaps you wanted to keep them visible for a bit 
longer), but is nevertheless a pretty good attempt at guessing.

However...

There is one slight "Gotcha" lurking still.  Our news server used to be
fed using a "normal" NNTP news sending process on our "upstream" site.  
This meant that articles arrived here in pretty much the same order as 
they had arrived at that site, and on the whole were in roughly 
chronological order.

However our feed has now been switched off to some Hyper-Intelligent NNTP 
feeding software called, I believe, "NNTPlink".  This works by attempting 
to send articles currently held in (our upstream feed computer's) memory 
to us in real time.  If an article couldn't be sent it is written to a 
queue file, and real-time transmission attempt the next article.  The 
articles held in the queue file is sent by more conventional means from 
time to time.

In practice this makes for much more efficient news sending, cutting down 
dramatically on disk I/O requirements (or so I hear).  However it does 
have the draw back that if our machine is heavily loaded (and hence slow) 
or down for a while then we are quite likely to receive articles without 
receiving the previous ones (which eventually appear later).

This confuses Pine's guesswork a bit, as delayed articles may be 
presented as "seen" when in fact you haven't seen them!

Hi,

My friend zipped and uuencoded a binary file and sent to me by attach it to
his mail.

But, when I try to uudecode it,"no begin line" appeared. I found that
there is really not begin line in the file. Why this happened? Can I
decode the file in another way.

FYI, my friend is using Pine and I am using mh.

Thanks in advance.

I think it is because the 'begin 644 <filename>' was MIMEd along with the 
rest of the file when he attached it.

I assume mh doesn't use MIME, or you would have been able to save the 
MIMEd attachment and uudecoded that.

Your friend MIMEd the uuencoded file by attaching it.  He should have 
read the file into the message body (ctrl-R in Pine).

You have two choices, 1) have him resend the uuencoded file (easy) or 2) get 
munpack try to unMIME the attachment then uudecode that file (hard).

Good luck.

I would appreciate some help!

I will be crossposting a group proposal to several newsgroups,
but I need all the traffic the posts generate to go to ONE
newsgroup. How do I do this?

I have read all the PINE manuals I can find, but I only saw
reference to Reply-to: which doesn't seem appropriate. Is there
a Followup-to: header command? 

Thanks in advance!

ZIPping a file allows multiple files to be stoed as one, and compressed 
in the process.  The result is usually known as an "archive" and is a 
binary file.

Binary files don't travel the e-mail system well, so are first converted 
to text (increasing their size somewhat), which does travel well.

UUENCODE is just of many ways of converting a binary file to text.

When someone sends a file using the "Attachment" feature of Pine (or 
ECSmail, or...) the file is encoded using a system called "MIME" 
(actually "Base-64 encoding" is more accurate -- one part of the 
specification which makes up MIME).

Base-64 encoding does a similar job as UUENCODE: it teks an input file 
(be it text or binary) and converts it to a (human unreadable) textual 
file ready for traversing the e-mail networks.

Pine (and probably other mailers) *always* encode files sent as 
attachments.  They *sometimes* encode the main message body if it has a 
very high proportion of binary data.

What you have received is the MIME-encoded UUENCODE-d ZIP-ped file.

If your mailer was "MIME aware" (can understand MIME-encoded attachments) 
the first step of "de-MIME-ing" it would be automatically done for you.  
If your mailer is not MIME-aware you need to get hold of a separate 
program to do it (like UUDECODE converts UUENCODED files back).

Once you have unpacked your attachment from MIME format you'll then have 
the UUENCODED file, ready for feeding to your UUDECODE program.

So you'll EITHER need to:

*  Get hold of a program to unpack MIME files to work on the attachment 
   you have already been sent

or,

*  Ask your colleague to send the UUENCODEd file to you by including it 
   in the message body rather than as an attachment.  (This is done in 
   Pine by placing the cursor in the Message Text area and using the 
   Ctrl/R (Read File) command to insert a file.  Text files included in 
   this way are not MIME-encoded.)

As an aside it is usually to simply attach the binary document to your 
message rather than first UUENCODEing in -- MIME handles the binary to 
text conversion instead.  This, of course, assumes that the recipient has 
a MIME-aware mailer or set of unpacking tools!

this is simple to fix, fortunately.  vi the file from your friend.
add, as the TOP line:
begin 644 myfile.gz
then save the file.  you will now be able to uudecode the file.  the
output will be named "myfile.gz", mode 644.

hope this helps!

Is there a way to auto pipe ALL incoming messages to a specific script in
Pine? 

If I try using the .forward file: 

\3dprint, "|/home/marlin/users/3dprint/bin/doug    3dprint"

where 'doug' is the script file. I get 'service not available' message.

If anyone has any idea how to solve this problem, please let me know.

Thanks in advance. :)

Unfortunately there is no mechanism in common use for saving additional
flags for news messages and we have not invented one for Pine yet...

In the current Pine 3.91 release, you can use ";" and "a" (assuming
enable-aggregate-cmd-set is selected in the Setup/Config screen).

Hmmm...  We thought this bug was fixed, but it still seems to be there for
some platforms, e.g. SunOS...

Anybody know what the status of IMSP (Internet Message Support Protocol) is 
these days?  When I went to retrieve a copy of the draft document on IMSP 
(ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-myers-imap-imsp-01.txt), I was 
told that since it had been an Internet draft for more than 6 months and not 
turned into an RFC, it had been deleted.

Does it exist somewhere else these days?
What's the timetable for it becoming an RFC?

Thanks.

Besides PINE for Windows there are various commercial products, one
being Simeon 3.0.2, which used to be known as ECSmail.

E-mail sales@esys.ca if you're interested.

I have been using Pine 3.89 for 6 months with Linux to read mail
which is retreived from my internet provider via pop which puts
the retrieved mail in /usr/spool/mail/ray. On June 1 when I went
to read my mail pine asked if I want to save copies of my sent and
readmsgs which I responded with a yes. After saving these files
pine informed me that /usr/spool/mail/ray was not a valid mailbox
folder. (I haven't changed anything it worked fine the day B4).
I checked file permissions, etc and could find nothing wrong.

I then got a copy of 3.91 and installed it. It doesn't tell me that
/usr/spool/mail/ray is an invalid folder but always shows that I
have 1 unread message which turns out to be ALL of my mail. i.e.
If I have 10 unread messages they are all in this one message.
When I read my mail with elm, it sees the ten messages.

Anyone have any ideas what's happened to cause this anomoly?

Thanks in advance...

I'm also in Jeff's position.... and I am NOT the sysadmin so
cannot make changes like that to the pine setup.

I think I can live with bouncing mail to my "list"--for the
moment--except that bouncing lists EVERYONE's ID!  Any
suggestions how to suppress the "Resent-To:" field whilst
bouncing? 

Thanks in advance!

Is it possible to use PC-PINE for Windows with POP3?  That's the protocol

We had the same problem with Russian (KOI8) characters, so i made a patch
to send.c which forces Pine 3.91 to post letters with such characters (0xA0..0xFE)
encoded as 8BIT instead of Q-P or BASE64. I can share it with anyone interested.

Hello PINEers --

Something very strange has occurred.  One of my users, who has been using 
pine for a while now, suddenly has a problem in sending mail.  He is 
trying to send mail to me (aplin@alpha.loyno.edu).  When he types my 
nickname (aplin) in the to field, instead of becoming 
"aplin@alpha.loyno.edu" it becomes "aplin@loyno.edu".  It's dropping the 
first part of the domain name.  I've looked at his setup/config, and 
everything looks okay.  He swears he did not change anything.

Any ideas?????

Thanks,
Mary Aplin

UWTV Presents
Easy Instruction In Using Electronic Mail

Imagine electronic communications as simple and as fast as fax, but with
world-wide connections without long distance charges, time difference
problems or busy signals. 

Imagine communications that are not paper-bound, but arrive as living
documents that can be edited, sent to multiple addressees and readily
incorporated into other documents. 

This has always been the promise of electronic mail (email); a promise
unfulfilled because of the limited distribution of networks and the lack
of easy-to-use, widely-available email software.  With the coming of age
of the Internet international communications network and the development
of the Pine email software by the University of Washington, the average
person can now enjoy the convenience, economy, productivity and speed that
were once limited to the elite at large corporations and major
universities. 

With the expansion of the Internet into smaller organizations and the
rapid proliferation of private sector providers of individual accounts,
ordinary people with a computer and a modem can readily avail themselves
of this powerful and user-friendly technology. 

UWTV is promoting this revolution in communications by airing the series
"Electronic Mail Using Pine" every Thursday night at 9:00 PM on cable
channel 27.  The series assumes no technological background on the part of
the viewer.  Given access to the Pine software via any of the widely
available Internet service providers, any viewer can quickly and easily
become a full-fledged citizen of the Internet and take advantage of the
opportunities there. 

The first and pilot program of the series is now airing.  Viewers are
guided through the Pine software by the personable team of Paul Reed Smith
and Susan Lawrence. Smith, as an Internet computing expert, provides all
the technical underpinnings necessary to rapidly master the technology,
and Lawrence represents the average user by leading the dialogue to the
practical applications of the technology.  Her savvy understanding of Pine
is complimented by interviews with real people who clearly explain how
access to email with Pine has has contributed to and improved their
communications and professional lives. 

The first program provides

  A description of the Internet
  An explanation of email and its applications
  Instruction in using email addresses
  The basics of using the Pine email software

Electronic Mail using Pine is a series whose time has come.  You won't
want to miss the pilot program and will enjoy and profit from the
continuation of the series that is currently under development. 

For more information about the Pine video call (206) 543-3800 or send 
email to pinetape@u.washington.edu

Hi:  I usually read my email using Eudora on a Macintosh.  However, when
I'm on the road I log in via a simple terminal emulator and have been
using ELM to read my mail.  ELM is OK except for having to use the vi or
emacs editor which is pretty bad.  I have tried using PINE which seems a
lot better, HOWEVER, I have this problem:

When I used to use ELM I was able to leave my ,messages untouched even
though I had read some of the messages, by exiting via "X" rather than via
"Q".  This then allowed me to read ALL of the messages (both the unread
and the previously read ones) with Eudora when I got back to the office.

I haven't been able to do this using PINE.  Any message that was
"previously read" is ignored by Eudora.  I can't find anything on the WWW
site FAQ about this.  I'm sure it's a simple matter, but being too simple,
I haven't figured it out yet.

Any help will be appreciated.  Please email me (gaba@hpp.stanford.edu)
rather than posting, although I will check this group for a while.

Thanks,

We have a CMS exec program named BOOK2UNI, which converts CMS notebooks to
the standard UNIX mailbox format.  I will send you instructions on how to
access/use it.

  I am also running Solaris 2.4, but if pine is run on a machine that is
also the smtp-server and "smtp-server=" is set to this local machine, NO
mail will be sent.  A message is returned saying--
[Error connecting to mail server: ]

  If the "smtp-server=" is changed to any other smpt server it works just fine.

Any ideas as to what might cause this?

    If some of your users are using PCs in terminal emulation mode, I 
presume they are using some sort of telecommunications software on the 
PCs.  Some packages (I know ProComm Plus v2, for a fact) allow keyboard 
remapping to a greater or lesser extent.  Check the documentation.  You 
may be able to map your way around the problem, so that your users do not 
have to use the cumbersome double-Esc business to send out a specific 
code (^X or whatever).

I have a slight problem with messages coming from a particular version of 
Microsoft Mail.  Whenever a group of Microsoft Mail users here at Wharton 
send a message, it appears as an attachment to me (and Pegasus Mail users, 
etc).  Apparently it has to do with the "name=xxxxx" tag at the tail end of 
the Content/Type line.

Is there a way to tell Pine to ignore Content/Type text/plain as a MIME 
attachment?

As I understand it, although this "name=xxxx" attachment is annoying, under the 
MIME RFC, it is legal.  Microsoft Mail attaches the subject line to the 
content/type line.  For example, a message with the subject "test" under 
Pine becomes

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

and under Microsoft Mail becomes

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; name="test"

I can recompile Pine to ignore this if it is possible.

Thanks!

Hi all:

One simple question for you:

Do the licensing agreement for Pine and Pico stated that they are freeware?


Please email me.  Thanks.

   How do I deal with MIME messages that have been forwarded to
   me by mailers (or people) who don't/can't deal with MIME?

Here is a local addition to our munpack(1) man page describing what
works here.

     NOTES
          If a MIME message is forwarded using a non-MIME compliant
          mailer, its MIME encoding will not be recognized.  To fix
          this, save the message as a file and edit the file.  Look
          for the first Content-Type: mail header, and copy that
          header into the first "paragraph" of mail headers, somewhere
          after its first line.

(Then use munpack.)

Hope this helps,

than whatever the default is.  i have poured through the man pages and
the .pinerc file and seen no hints about this.  i have also built pine
several times and don't remember this ever being an option.  if anyone

It's #define'd as a constant in one of the include files in the pine/osdep

Yesterday afternoon I posted a question as to why pine was dropping part 
of the address in a nickname. Example:  aplin@alpha.loyno.edu was being
changed to aplin@loyno.edu  when my user (just one) used my nickname from 
the system address book.

I'm not sure why it happened, but I deleted the .pinerc file in the user 
account and gave him a new one.  It seems to be working fine now.

If anyone has any ideas WHY this happened, I would like to know...

e-mail? (as in Pegasus Mail).

Thanks.

Subject: Pine (or Pico) in Windows version keyboard bug
Date: 16 Jun 1995 07:28:23 GMT

In the Pine Windows version when I compose a message, Pine (or perhaps 
this is Pico now) _sometimes_ displays scandinavian letters incorrectly. 
 I don't yet know if they are really sent OK and only displayed wrong.

When I press the key labeled a with two dots above (I believe it is 
called adiaeresis) it is displayed as the greek letter "sigma".  O with 
two dots above (odiaeresis) is displayed as "division sign", a dash with 
a dot above and under.

So far I haven't used Windows-Pine very much and I haven't run into this 
trouble very often, I just thought to report it.

Has anyone else been plagued by this probelem?

There is a macro defined in one of the source files (can't remember
which now) that sets the time interval between new mail checks.
You can also use ^N when your in the INBOX index to force a mail
check.

Question 1: Many of our users access our Pine mail server with terminals or
PCs in terminal emulation.  Their connection is routed through DEC terminal
servers.  These terminal servers reserve certain control sequences for
their own use so if Pine uses those, they have no effect.  In particular,
Control-x to send does not work.  We are substituting an Esc-Esc sequence
for the Control key (for example, Esc-Esc-x for Control-x).  This works
most of the time except in certain instances when the terminal mode is not
VT-100 (see question 2).  Does anyone know of another way around this
control sequence problem?

Question 2: Is it possible to set it up in such a way that Pine operates
satisfactorily in a terminal mode of VT-300 or VT-400?

Try run pine in read-only mode (I think pine -r, but I am not sure) or use
a flag command and set the flag New for appropriate messages (for many of
them this job is easier selecting them and aplying flag command on them).=

Hope this helps =20

I saved an earlier message relating to that problem and did the 
patches. They work very well and I hope you will enjoy too.

Apply following patch then enable the 8bit option in Config
menu (enable-send-only-8bit, enable-8bit-in subject).

It seems pine 3.92 will add 8bit esmtp as a optional
feature.

Actually, it's *Ctrl/L* to force a new mail check.

(You _can_ also do it by doing "N" several times at the bottom of the 
index, but Ctrl/L is the preferred (and instantaneous) way of forcing a 
check.

Mary,
Without seeing the .pinerc file that was deleted, it is impossible to say,
but it sure sounds like you would have found some character(s) --perhaps
garbage-- after the "use-only-domain-name=" variable.

I am in need of having to add a "Reply To:" header to my outgoing messages.
I have attempted to use the "customized-hdrs" list variable to do this:

  customized-hdrs=Reply-to: darren@sirsi.com,
	Return-path: darren@sirsi.com

which contains my domain name only, rather than the specific host the message
originates from.

The problem is that this seems to have no effect whatsoever. Does anyone have
any ideas why setting this does not work? I have it set now and if you look at
the header of this message you will see that it is missing.

Something has happened to corrupt your INBOX to make Pine think that it is
not a mail folder.  Something as simple as a newline before the first

I have my inbox set up so that after I read messages, they automatically
go to a folder called "received messages" unless I delete them.  If there
is something I want to keep in the inbox, I flag it New.  For about a
week, I've not been able to flag messages as new.  I press the *, and
then the N for New, and it says "Message x flagged as New."  But the
automatic D (for Delete) is still there.  I try again, and it says
"Message x already flagged New".  But it's not.  And when I log out,
all the messages behave as though deleted.   Ideas, anyone?  I haven't
changed anything in my setup.

Double check the "user-domain" and "use-only-domain" settings in
setup/config...

"New" and "Deleted" are separate flags.  By doing "*N" you set the New
flag, but that does not affect the Deleted flag.  Since Pine only uses one
column to display status, you only see the "D" even though the message is
also marked "New".  The solution is to Undelete ("U" or "*!D") the
message in addition to "*N".

Hallo!

  Today I try to bounce a realy huge message (about 5 MB --- I tested my=20
video/mpeg mailcap entry). But pine did not do it and after it either=20
running an eternal viewer (mpeg_play) or sending a very short message=20
(about five lines) did not work. Pine always told me: `Not enough space'=20
and then `Internal error: not enough space' (or something like that).=20
Before trying to bounce both those things worked well. Is it a bug? I am=20
sorry I cannot send you things like pine.debug but I accidentally removed=
=20
them. Thanks for any explanation.

                                  V. S.

I would like to install Pine in an MS-Windows environment using
"Beam and Whiteside" TCP/IP.

   (a) Has any one done this?
   (b) Is it possible?
   (c) can I use a compiled pcpine_?.zip or do I need to compile my own?
   (d) if the former, which pcpine_?.zip do I get.
   (e) if I need to recompile, what advice can you give?
   (f) Is there a Pine FAQ  (I didn't check rtfm, but I did look
       on what I hope is a local mirror  (src.doc.ic.ac.uk).

Thanks.

Pegasus uses some "private" headers for that function, since there's no official
method in the RFC822 mail standard supporting receipt acknowledgement.  Depending
on the mailer used at the remote end, you *may* find that getting Pine to insert
Return-Receipt-To: your-address
or
Acknowledge-To: your-address
headers (perhaps by adding either or both as "custom headers" in your Pine config)
will do what you want.  There's a group in the Internet Engineering Task Force
working on the specification of this type of facility, but until that's published
and widely implemented, only ad hoc methods like these may work and then only for
those recipients whose mailers support them.

David,
Thanks for responding. My INBOX appears to be a pointer to my mail file which
is /usr/spool/mail/raya. I have completely removed the file and let pine create
a new one for me. With 3.91 pine always shows only one message waiting but if 
I use elm to read the same file, elm sees all the messages i.e. 22 messages
and each on a seprate line. Right now there are 22 messages in my mail file and
when pine is started and I open INBOX folder I see:

 PINE 3.91    FOLDER INDEX        Folder: INBOX(READONLY) Message 1 of 1 NEW
 N 1   Jun 16 raya@onramp.net      (118K) /usr/spool/mail/raya

Pine has worked great and I really love it as a mail reader but this happened
suddenly when I executed pine on June 1 and as far as I know I've made no
changes in the mail arena. When I start up my Linux (1.2.9) and login in with
my user id, 'pop' is started which will connect to my ISP and retreieve any
mail on the ISP machine and deposit it in /usr/spool/mail/raya. I've been
doing it this way since mid Jan. 

The three things that really stand out to me are that:
1) It sees all my mail as one mail message
2) The one mail message is from me (raya@onramp.net)
3) The INBOX is opened as READONLY

permissions on my mail file is:

-rw-------   1 raya     system     115632 Jun 16 22:15 /usr/spool/mail/raya

I've tried chmod 660 with group being system and mail but this made no diff-
erence. And like I stated earlier, I rm'd the file and then executed elm to
create the file for me but this has made no difference either.

Could the header format from my ISP changed? I've verified that there is no
blank line in the beginning of my mail file.

I just did a find / -name INBOX and there is nothing on my system named that.
I assumed that INBOX is an internal variable which is set equal to the mail
file you want to read. 

I think tonite I will install pine from scratch creating a new Mail directory
in my home directory and follow the installation instructions.

If you can shed further lite on this I would appreciate it, I also cc'd
pine-info on this.

Again thanks for your help.

actually, this would not make as much sense as it sounds (although i
have been in the very same situation many times).  if the option
"quit-without-confirm" is set, then pine just quits when you type q.
assuming that is already set, when you type q, pine knows it will be
quitting.  when it has a question for you, like should i move all the
read messages into the default folder, it just wants to know tha
answer to that question, and then it will go back to what it was
doing.  quitting.  

to get the type of functionality that you want, get rid of the
"quit-without-confirm" option.  this will then ask you everytime you
try and quit, if you really want to quit.  annoying, but sometimes, it
is quite worth it.

Thanks,  I had already discoverd this by running pine in debug mode
and looking at how it was trying to send the mail, in this case it
was using 'sendmail', which wasnt working :-(.

As you suggested above, I changed the "smtp-server" variable, but in
my case I used the global config file /usr/local/pine/pine.conf.
You can type 'pine -conf' to generate the default config file if you
dont already have this file.

I got the source for PINE 3.91 from ftp.cac.washington.edu and was

closest.  The documentation said to look in /doc/pine-ports for
information on other ports, but that file was no where to be found.  I
noticed a makefile for the long dead Solaris 2.2, but I was unable to
do anything with it.  I read thru the FAQ, but found nothing on this.
Am I missing something here?  What do I need to compile PINE on
Solaris 2.4?

That means that Pine is opening it as a flat text file, which is always
READONLY with the curent drivers.  It is possible that something from your
ISP is causing a problem.  At this point I would have to see an example of
your /usr/spool/mail/raya file to identify the problem.  One thing you could
check is to make sure that the "From " line is getting written in the correct
format, particularly the date field, which is a fixed format.  Compare it
with another folder that Pine can read...

There are two known causes of this problem.  I think that (2) is the one
that is biting you, since you've been using this for several months.  Both
of these have to do with the internal "From " headers.

(1) some locally-written programs that deliver mail write the day as a
    variable-length field, when it is really fixed, e.g. "Jun 1" instead
    of "Jun  1".

(2) a popular fetch-via-POP perl script has a typo in it that will cause
    it to write "June" instead of "Jun" in the header.  This has caused a
    number of unpleasant surprises to people who use it this month.

Basically, the solution is to find the problem and fix it.  For (2), it's
a matter of changing "June" to "Jun" in the script.  All the other months
are in their correct 3-letter forms.

Hi everybody!

	Does anybody know if it is possible to set up PINE to get a 
"Confirmation Reading" and/or a "Confirmation Delivery" when I send an 
e-mail? (as in Pegasus Mail).

Thanks.

I use pico on a sun system as a stand-alone editor.  I've probably got 10+
hours in trying to figure out how to change the tabstops from every 8 to
every 4. 

Any clues on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanx.

    My understanding is that Pine, itself, does not.  Some "private" mail 
systems, such as Pegasus, may.  However, to the best of my knowledge, 
there is no Internet standard for such confirmation.  You can go into 
Pine's configuration (if you have Pine 3.91) and put in a 
return-receipt-requested header, but even then, you will get a receipt 
only if the receiving mail system honors it.  Not all do.  If it does, 
you will know only that the recipient's mail system got it, not that the 
recipient has read it.

     I hope this is not an old, many times-answered question, but when I switched to Telnet 
2.6.1 JB16, I lost the ability to use the ^^ sequence to mark text in Pico.  I don't know 
what mapping problems are going on, but I would like to get that capability back.  All I get 
now is a "6" when I try it.

Check out the following option under Setup/Config from the pine main menu:

I have a problem using pine. It seems that sendmail sometimes doesn't place
a blank line between the last message and the 'From user@host <date>' line
that marks the beginning of the next message. Pine is able to correctly
locate the 'From user@host <date>' line but it removes the last NL character
from the previous message. Thus when the message is exported or piped to a
command (e.g. when using ftpmail), the last line isn't terminated with a
NL and causes all sorts of problems. The worst is when I tag 2 messages and
pipe them to a command, the first line of the 2nd message is concatinated
onto the last line of the 1st message.

So my question is, has anybody else seen this and possibly fixed (or hacked
it if sendmail is at fault) it. I believe the fix needs to be in the
c-client but I havn't found the correct place to add it. I simply want to
append a NL if the last character in the message isn't already a NL.

Thanks.

It's true, there is no filtering in Pine.  However, if you mark 
"enable-aggregate-commands" in the config file, you can sort things out 
pretty fast with the following sequence of commands:

;  -- enables aggregate command
t  -- mark by Text
a  -- search All text (sometimes the mailing list name is only in the CC)
s  -- Save
foldername -- folder you want to save it in
x -- eXpunge.  Removes the files.

You can then repeat the process if you have several mailing lists to deal 
with.  In the end, which comes pretty quick, you've got all your personal 
mail in front of you, and all the mailing list mail in the appropriate 
folders.  Personally I found this simpler and more fool proof than 
Procmail for mailing lists that generated under fifty letters a day.

Hope this helps,

Michael

Two things in connection with this:

(1) The on-the-fly created "From " line which is inserted when
    using the Export command has no space between the address
    and the date - bug, I suppose? Example:
        From psv@nada.kth.seMon Jun 19 00:49:33 1995

(2) It *would* be very nice (as I have said before) if there was
    a way to get a "From " line in the Pipe and/or Print command,
    to get a safe way for a postprocessing program to find the
    message boundaries.

David--

Go back to whereever you downloaded Telnet from.  In that same directory,
there should be a "kchr" resource you need to download.  After downloading
it (it's very small), drag it onto your System FILE (not just the System
Folder).  Then go to the Control Panels, open up the Keyboards panel, and
choose the new kchr.  That's all you need to do.  (You may have to restart
the Mac, but you may not.) 

This is all due to a tiny bug in the kchr that comes with the System.  The
new kchr simply compensates for it.

If you can't find the kchr, let me know and I'll email it to you; it's
only a few K.

David,
	Here is something to try; when using pine via my modem at home, 
I must press the <esc> key, then the Ctrl-^ to get mark to work.  Maybe 
it will help you.

Yey another useful feature in pine would be the ability to have several 
different alternate editors available.  Although there are multiple uses 
for the ability to execute a program/script while inside pine, one can 
only set up a single program to run.

BTW, I use the Alt-Editor to add prewritten answers to common questions 
that I get from users.  (I work as a sysadmin)

It seem that I occasionally recieve messages that contain multiple From:
lines (excluding From user@host <date>). An example is as follows:

   To: "Rodney W. Grimes" <rgrimes@gndrsh.aac.dev.com>

   Sender: current-owner@FreeBSD.Org

The problem is that Pine reads the first From: line and translates it to

root@mydomain in the index. Instead of user@domain in second followind 
From: line.

Can I filter this out somehow? Its kind of a pain when scanning many 
messages.

You could install procmail, and then filter all (or just the offending)
messages through:

	formail -U From:

which eliminates all but the last occurrence of From:.

Hello,
just a simple question, but I've never heard/seen an answer to it: Does Pine 
subscribe automatically to new Newsgroups, or must I edit the .newsrc by 
myself (on a UNIX-PINE 3.90/91) to get it?

Thanx in advance 

Ciao

Ben,
Take a look at your sent-mail folder.  I'm betting you'll see the correct
Reply-To: in those messages.  This suggests that some software outside of
Pine is stripping the Reply-To off the messages before they escape from
interaccess.com.

I'm willing to try anything but, below is the full header from the fcc 
folder.  As you can see, the 'Reply-to' is not there.  That suggests 
the problem is indeed in Pine, not in external software.  Note this is 
true of both my PCPine and the BSD Unix Pine in my unix shell account.

I have experienced this same problem with PCPine 3.91 on my PPP machine
and BSD Pine 3.91 on my unix shell account.  Both have been properly set
for reply-to (or is it necessary to re-specify ALL headers for this to
work?) I see the Reply-To when I do a Ctrl-R (expand headers) during
message-compose but I never see the 'Reply-To' line in the actual
email/news posting.  (check this msg/news post to see!)

                       ==================
   Ben Parker (IL) bparker@interaccess.com  71450.2735@compuserve.com
 
--------
I suspect the problem is somehow in the way I have entered the 
'Reply-To' data, but I'm not sure and it looks OK if you manually 
check the pinerc file(s) on both systems (I sent copies of those to 
DLM, I can send to you to if you want...)  

I have not tried a whole new FTP and install of PCPine.  Maybe that is
necessary (but then why would the BSD pine be similarly affected with
this problem...?)

 Thanks!

To anyone, 
I tried to compile Pine on our AViiON.  It gave me some errors.
I was using the .d-g extension.  

one error was os_d-g.c: In function 'portable_utime'
                        storage size of 'times' isn't known.

in os.c

Make Don't know how to make /c-client/c-client.a
came up.
We are on DG/UX 5.4R3.10 patch 26.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks, Jim Beitmann

	The pine I use is on a unix machine of some sort, somewhere in 
the bowels of this building; I get to it through OS/2 on this machine, 
using telnet. I can do so through either an OS/2 window, or a full-screen 
OS/2 session.
	Each has advantages: with the window I can use OS/2 cut&paste, 
which I find very useful, for instance for transferring things from other 
mailers or newsreaders (LaMail, NR/2, nonce glimpses at Usenet groups via 
the local gopher, ...); with the full screen, my print screen button works.
	I've been trying doing both at once -- actually, of course, one 
right after the other. The second always has to get a mailbox lock from 
the first, rendering the first into a read-only session. As long as I 
remember to get the sequence right, so that the one I want to actually 
use has the lock, there seems to be no problem with this.
	However, this morning both OS/2 icons began behaving so weirdly 
that I finally just did a shutdown and warm boot. This window now works 
normally again, or so it appears. But I'm wondering if I did something to 
it somehow yesterday, and should refrain from the double-dipping.
	Does it matter, for instance, to be accessing my pine mail on the 
same account simultaneously in normal and in read-only mode? Does it hurt 
to print from the read-only mode while the normal one goes on as usual?

Hi there

This is the first minutes that I've joined to this newsgroup and I am
wondering if there is any FAQ on this newsgroup. If yes, I would
appreciate it if anyone e-mail it to me. 

For the meantime 2 simple questions for the PINEist:
1- How can I include more than one (previously received mail) in sending 
e-mail?
2- How can I save my mails on floppy?

Thanks in advance

Hamid

Select all messages you want to include (via ; command) and then Apply=20
(A) Forward (F). This should do what you want.

For everyone else, compiled binaries are available at ftp.celestial.com
and odi.cwc.whecn.edu.  However, they were built on SCO 3.2.4.2, and 
older versions may have troubles.  If you do have trouble with those 
binaries, contact the guy who put them together, not the Pine team at 
UW.  Pine does work, it's just the individual build that would need 
tweaking.

While on the topic of features, I think key mapping would be a brilliant
feature.  Many of us (who read mailing lists, etc.) use the same key
combinations over and over.  For instance I often delete everything in a 
folder with:  ;aad.  Also, if it were possible to have different sorts
for different folders.  On some of my high-volume mailing lists I like
to sort Ordered-Subject.  On others, I want it in date receive.

Thank you for a great product!
(When is the next version coming out?)  :-)

Subject: mutiple INBOX problem
Date: 20 Jun 1995 02:44:33 GMT
Message-Id: <3s5cmh$h8f@mail.one.net>
Status: O
X-Status: 


    Okeedoke, I'm still messing with mutiple INBOXes, and I still can't 
get it to work. Is it possible to direct mail from a certain person (ie. 
mail address: name@site.domain) to a specific INBOX. I did receive a 
helpful example for diverting mail under a certain subject heading to a 
specific box, but that won't work in my situation. 
    I also tried setting up this INBOX system I was described with 
subject heading diverting, however, that actualy didn't work either. It 
seemed logical (going into .pinerc and adding an incoming_folders 
statement...."Blah Blah Subject" mail/blah....). However, when I had a 
message sent to me with the subject line, it still went to default INBOX, 
and when I decided to select the "blah" folder, it said folder does not 
exist. Then when I decided to create the folder myself with vi (just made 
a blank file) the folders where there, but still not having the 
appropriate messages sent to them, and they were also read only, which 
isn't good either.
    Well, I still would like to have mail from specific mail addresses 
(in this case a mailing list from a listserver) diverted to an 
appropriate folder. Thanks for any help....

Try rebuilding Pine with the latest IMAP2bis toolkit, version 3.6.BETA,
from ftp.cac.washington.edu, mail/imap.tar.Z  Some bugs were fixed between
version 3.5 (which Pine 3.91 ships with) and 3.6

get and use a program called procmail. This will allow them to send the 
messages to /dev/null by the sender information. procmail is available 
from most of the popular FTP sites.

Looking at the source, Pine 3.91 decides how to `MIME label' a file one
attaches to a message being created by peeking at the first few bytes,
and checking these against a few built-in file types it knows about. 

Are there any plans for Pine to support the (arguably more flexible)
`mime.types' mechanism, whereby the labelling for given file types may
be configured externally by the user, in just the same way as the viewer
for received mail may be configured with `mailcap' ?

Isn't there a FAQ on this?

Okay. there is a program called procmail that you can run on almost any 
machine. You modify your .forward file to send all incomming mail to the 
procmail program. Then you use a .procmailrc file to create rules for 
sorting mail into incomming folders based on any criteria you want. Tada!

pine doesn't support filtering as part of the program.

I have an address list made up entirely of people in the local domain.  It
is my understanding that I need use only the userid of each party in the
list.  This works, mostly.  When I mail to the list, three of the
addresses in it fail and the MAILER_DAEMON mail failed message lists the 
failed addresses in this form: 

<userid@***address-loop-or-duplicate***> ... illegal character in hostname

These userids are 3, 4, and 5 characters long, and not together in the 
list, and they are not duplicates.

How can this be corrected?

Thanks.

Seems like someone is trying to keep you from compiling programs :-).
Ask your sysadmin about the C-compiler.

I have am in the process of testing pc-pine for use in our campus computer
labs.  I would like to run the pine.exe from our novell server and have
the pinerc, pine.sig, newsrc files  and my address book on the student's
floppy disk.  

I have set up an environment variable:
    PINERC=B:\PINERC
and have the working directory set to B: also

I am able to run pine.  However, when it tries to update the pinerc
file with my personal name and user id it gives the following error
message:
    error saving configuration in file "B:": No such file or directory

I am unable to get at my address book aliases too.

I am, however, able to connect to our unix machine and read, delete, and
mail messages.

Any assistance with this would be appreciated.  I have looked through
the FAQ other info on the www.cac.washintgton.edu/pine location.  

[I have been successfully/happily using pine-pc on my own work pc for
over a year now.]

This posting updates some of the things I asked in comp.mail.misc
regarding syncing mail reads across UNIX and POP.  I tried this out again
last night and reads actually DO sync but deletes definitely don't.  I see
this as being a much more crucial issue.  Right now, I have to go and
manually delete/expunge messages in Pine that I have 'deleted' in Eudora. 
Am I missing the point here or what re local/remote mail reading?  Can
anyone out there describe how/whether they can sync deletes across these
packages?  Is there a POP mail reader that can update the mail from my
home directory on the server?

Thanks again...

My organisation is currently evaluating ELM and PINE, to choose
one of them as the main Mailer.

My personal impression is that PINE seems to have more nice
features and better alias/address handling, but that ELM has
a better user interface (E.g. PINE seems to be mixing 'M', 'Q'
and 'E' when exiting various screens).

MIME seems to be working OK on both, at least as far as my
limited tests show.

What is the opinion among all you experienced users? What are
the pros and cons of the two products?

All input will is appreciated.

This has been cross-posted (I hope...) to both 'comp.mail.elm'
and 'comp.mail.pine'.

With POP, you are usually downloading mail from the server to the client
and often then deleting mail from the server (depending upon whether or
not you set the "keep mail on server" option).

The point is that when you "delete" a message in Eudora, you are deleting
the local copy, not the copy on the server.

Basically, what you apparently want to use is IMAP, not POP.  IMAP
supports the "manage mail on the server" model that POP does not.
Unfortunately, Eudora doesn't support IMAP yet.  Consider PC-Pine or
Simeon for Windows, or MailDrop for the Mac, as an alternative to Eudora.

Bah.  I won't argue that IMAP doesn't have a richer function set than
POP, nor even that IMAP doesn't have a different underlying philosophy 
than POP, but the POP protocol _does_ support keeping a local mailbox
synchronized with a mailbox on the server.  (ie the TOP and/or
UIDL commands)  

Different clients, however, take advantage of this support to 
different degrees....

Pine uses it's own MIME stuff, so it's kind of a pain to add types (i.e.
auto-display attached GIFs, etc).  ELM uses metamail, so you can do
ANYTHING with it.  Pine's a lot easier to attach files, but you can't
specify type of attachment.

I like them both.  It's easier to teach Pine to a new user, but ELM does
more stuff.  One major annoyance about pine is that it handles arrow
keys on terminals other than VT/ANSI very badly.

Hi -

This is a reply to both your comp.mail.pine posting and your email
question.

"no map file specified" is not one of our error messages, nor does it
appear to be in the inetd that we use.  I fear that this message came
from somewhere in the bowels of HP-UX, and you need to persue it there.

I would check "man inetd" to make sure there are no HP-UX specific details
that you need to be aware of.  If you are running something like Yellow
Pages, NIS, or NetInfo, you may need to check to see what you need to do
to register your updates to /etc/services there.

Good luck, and please remember to post the solution once it's uncovered.

Is there such a thing a MIME decoding utiltiy for DOS, a MIMEdecode as it were?
If there is, I'd sure appreciate a program name or URL for it.  I suppose it's
out of the question that there would be one for the Mac, also.

As a last resort, is a decoding algorithm available so I could write my own?

Hi,


  I've tried to check root's mail unix PC-Pine and it doesn't work. In the
INCOMING-FOLDERS I have given the {host}inbox specifier, but when I want to
check the mail, I enter root and its password, but Pine says Login error. Of
course the password is the right one.. I was just trying to avoid reading my
(root) fourth mailbox using a telnet session. Why isn't that working ? Is 
there an inherent limitation within Pine ?

Hi,


  This question is related to the previous I've just posted. I have three
mailboxes to check on a single server, so I tried to add three different
entries in the INCOMING FOLDERS field, using BOX1 {host}inbox, BOX2
{host}inbox, BOX3 {host}inbox, and it failed. Once Pine opens one connection
to the server (host), with given login and password I cannot check a second
mailbox with the second entrie... it uses the previous entered login and
password. Is it possible to solve this problem with version 3.91 (the one I
run) or do I have to wait for an other release? 

  Of course, if I forward all mail from BOX2 to host2 and BOX3 to host3, then
I'm able to check them... but this means that each mailbox I have to read has
to be duplicated on a server so that Pine doesn't get confused. I can't see
the difference between opening two connections to the same server (with
different logins and passwords) and opening two connection to two different
hosts. :-)

  Thanks for your replies

Again,


  Will such an option be available in the next release ? I was administrating
a mail system and answering to queries using root wasn't a problem... but I'm
now sharing the administrative tasks with several other people and we'd like
to be able to send our mails to users as if they were coming from an
"admin-mail" superuser :-) so we'd need to edit the From field before sending
out the messages. 

  Editing the From field can be dangerous... but not really worse than
sending mail directly from a telnet to port 25. If I'm up to date, it seems
that SMTP could soon implement an Authentication mechanism analogous to IMAP
4bis', so how about giving the possibility to edit the field ?

  with no more questions yet...

My name is Jessica Reed and I am a systems administrator at Bowman Gray
Medical School in Winston-Salem, N.C.  I am installing pine for our
Silicon Graphics machine.  It is currently running IRIX 5.3 in case that
is pertinent.  The problem that I came across is that when I followed the
steps in the /doc/tech-notes.me text, I did not get very far.  I typed
"build clean" and then "build sgi."  At this point the compiler worked for
a few minutes and then instead of listing the sizes of the four binaries
built, the computer displayed the message that it could not open bin/imapd,
bin/pine, and bin/mtest.  It did, however, give the size of bin/pico.
	Is this a common problem, and if so , does anyone know how to
remedy it?  Thank you for your time.

I queried this some time ago when I tried to do the same thing.

Basically it is not possible to read root's mail using an IMAP 
connection.  Specifically the IMAP server code forbids root from 
successfully authenticating, even if the correct password is used.

This is apparently to side-step the security issues which tend to arise 
when any protocol supporting "root" access is created.

The advice I received was to have root's mail delivered to an "ordinary" 
username and login to that in order to read it over an IMAP connection.

However this would have been dificult in our environment.

The solution I went for was to access the mail files straight from disk 
for root.  Obviously this only works if the mailstore is mounted on the 
machine you are doing the reading from.  Ours is, but we use IMAP for all 
other users to access their mail (and hence get the benefits of IMAP).

Things were complicated slightly by my setting up IMAP access to the 
INBOX in the global "fixed" configuration file, thereby forcing all users 
to use IMAP to access their INBOX.  This included root...

My solution was to modify the Pine source code slightly so that if Pine 
was being used by "root" AND the "fixed" configuration file was being 
read THEN the "inbox-path" variable's value was ignored (as if it wasn't 
present in the "fixed" file).

This meant that root defaulted to accessing the INBOX file directly from 
the NFS-mounted filestore, but that all other users were forced to use 
IMAP for theirs.

This difficulty does not arise if you aren't forcing IMAP access to the 
INBOX in the "fixed" configuration file: simply modify the inbox-path 
variable in root's Pine settings to not use IMAP.

If you ARE forcing IMAP access in the "fixed" configuration file you 
could give me a shout and I'll dig out my patch for the Pine 3.91 source 
code to let you "override" (ignore) the "inbox-path" variable value just 
for the root username.

Hi Everyone,

I have a UNIX user who loves how PINE can print out a message to his
local Macintosh printer (using NCSA Telnet).  He'd like to be able to
do this from the "$" prompt with other text files.  Does anyone know
how PINE does the print-to-ansi?  Is there a stand-alone utility that
will do the trick (and where do I find it?!).

Thanks!

Pine sends the ANSI print-through command (<esc>[5i) to the 
terminal/emulator, sends the message, then sends the ANSI 
cancel-print-through command (<esc>[4i).  I believe this command is 
compatible with most DEC vtxxx terminals.

 This is short test message to test the present function of the Reply-To
 from Free Agent...

-----------
Any further ideas?  DLM seems to think the problem is with 
smtp.interaccess.com, but didn't say exactly what.  If that's true, why 
does Free Agent manage to send a reply-to header while Pine doesn't.  
And the reply-to in Pine still doesn't show up in the (internal to 
Pine) File Copy from either PC-Pine or Unix Pine.  Hmmmm...

Any further help appreciated!

There is a standard pair of VT100 escape sequences that instruct the 
terminal (emulator) to go into "bypass to printer" mode and back.  If you 
select the "attached to ansi" option in Pine it sends these at the start 
and end of the message text.

If you look in the contrib/utils directory within the Pine distribution 
you will find a little program written in C that can be used as a filter 
to achieve the same effect.  ie,
	ansiprt <filename

If you are doing the updates manually, the manager needs to specify it as
a personal addressbook.  You might also want to do the updates on a
private copy, then copy the addressbook and addressbook.lu files to the
real global addressbook periodically...

Mpack and munpack are utilities for encoding and decoding
(respectively) binary files in MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) format mail messages.  For compatibility with older forms
of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode
messages in split-uuencoded format.  The Macintosh version can also
decode messages in split-BinHex format.

In short, munpack is the MIME equivalent of uudecode/binhex.

Versions are included for unix, pc, os2, mac, amiga and archimedes
systems.  The canonical FTP site for this software is

:)

But is there a way that I can ask Pine to add a special header to the message,
so when the person I wrote to reads the message, a note is sent to me?

I use Pine over a dialup line (I have a shell account). The problem is
that my roommate's new girlfriend (who isn't fully trained yet :) will
pick up the phone, or my provider will simply hang up on me, usually while
composing my magnum opus.

I use the internal pico as my editor and don't really want to change.

What, if anything, can I do to recover these lost missives?

Thanks,
Steve

The POP3 protocol has no provision for syncing deletes -- it just
transfers mail from the server to the client.  IMAP4 can sync deletes
between different clients -- even if they're simultaneously connected
to the same mailstore.  Check out:

I didn't mean to be flippant, but you must have missed the lenghty thread 
on return receipts.

There is a feature of sendmail or mail that if you include Receipt-to (*I 
think*) in your header, the receiving system may send you a message that 
the system received it.

Some programs, e.g., cc:mail, have a receipt feature.  

There is a lot of controversy over whether it is a good idea.

We used registered receipts for years on a company project, and it was 
great, but, imagine that you send a message to a distribution list of 100 
people - do you want 100 receipts?

I think the best approach is to ask you recipient to send you and 
acknowledgement.

    In general over the Internet, there is probably no way to do what you 
wnat to do.  So far as I know, there is no Internet standard, and there 
is no way you as a remote sender can coerce a distant computer into doing 
what you want if it has not already been programmed to do so.  Sorry.

  Usualy the privite mail systems add some private header to indicate the
other side (if it understand it) they ask for a return or reading receipt.
`Return-Receipt-To: <addresss>' is commonly used for delivery receipts (as
it works on many Unix systems, too), reading receipts alters (for instance
Pegasus Mail uses `X-Confirm-Delivery-To: <address>'). You can add those
to customised headers (empty) and learn your users how to add their
address id they like to get the receipt.

  I would like to know what headers are used to indicate these types of
receipts by MS Mail (and other mailer different from Pegasus Mail/First
Mail). Could you be so glad and send me (personally) their names (or a
testing mail with these receipt requests set on)? Thanks.

I'm not familiar with all that many clients and servers, but here's what
I know.

Most servers support the TOP command -- it's been in the protocol
as an optional command since (I believe) the first RFC on POP3.  
Servers that I _know_ to support it are OSF/1, 4.3BSD, and 
whatever the Linux Slackware distribution comes with.  

I don't think UIDL is very common; I did see it in the source code
for one pop server, but sorry I don't remember which one.  

As far as clients, I'm even less sure.  I think Eudora uses
TOP and looks at the non-standard (but common on UNIX) "Status:"
field.  Any mailer which has a "do not delete mail on server"
must be using either UIDL or TOP (unless of course the
programmer is clever than me! :) )

In particular, I don't know of any clients (again, my experience is
limited though!) that support the "sync deletes" idea that started
this thread.  I would think it wouldn't be too hard to implement, though,
as long as the server at least supports TOP.  Has anyone else seen
such a client?

UIDL is new.  Most POP client and server implementations do not support
it.  I wrote one of the few POP servers that has it.

It is really stretching it to claim that TOP supports keeping a local
mailbox synchronized with a mailbox on the server.  All TOP does is
display the first n lines of the mailbox.

Ditto.  Using Solaris x86 2.4, gcc 2.6.3, and a path that
looks like:

lots of stuff like: (doing a build sol)

It's not Pine, it's in IMAP server that's doing you in.  You're not
allowed to log in as root (or any other uid 0 user) over IMAP.

This error message looks like it came from your SMTP server.  I'd suggest
taking a loook at things there.  In general, if you see a 3-digit number
in an error message, it's a good bet that it came from either an SMTP or
an NNTP server instead of from the bowels of Pine.

I managed to compile Pine on Solaris 2.4 using gcc 2.6.3.

The compilation was succesfull when I included a 
  -DANSI
in the compiler options in the makefile. 

I think the reason for the problem is the following:

In headers.h the following appears
#ifndef ANSI
#define const  /* For mail.h  */
#endif
which is activated if the preprocessor symbol ANSI is not #defined (indicating
a non-ansi compiler).  

With #define const  the statement

  extern int memcmp(const void *, const void *, size_t);

is proccessed by the pre-processor to

  extern int memcmp(void *, void *, size_t);

and since the definition of memcmp both appears in memory.h and strings.h,
the placement of #define const may well explain the problem. I have not tracked
the exact reason down - using -DANSI worked for me (well only after help of a
colleague, who showed me the use of  gcc -E to see the output of the
preprocessor, and thus find the difference in the definition of memcmp

Subject: automatic bouncing with pine?
Date: 22 Jun 1995 09:50:15 GMT
Message-Id: <3sbecn$dcv@winx03.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de>

Hello,

is there anybody who knows about the possibility of automatic
mail bouncing, may be triggered by a special dot-file.

an example should explain what I mean:

if someone is on vacation and leaves his machine running, the mailer
should be able to send the mails back to the sender with a short reply why 
the mail was sent back. I know that this is possible on sgi's, but I 
don't know how to enable this behaviour. 

So while I'm writing, I am not very shure, if this question belongs realy
into the pine group. But perhaps somebody of you know an answer.
thanks

btw: I'm working on a Linux box...

Lex, could you enlighten us about which clients do what and about which

Although I don't have the commands handy, I would like to mention that 
the ANSI commands for blinking, bold, inverse, underline, cursor 
positioning, etc., can mess up terminals/emulators that do not recognize 
those commands. 

I found this out through a humbling experience when I forwarded a really 
neat Thanksgiving message with a turkey walking into an oven and 
coming out cooked.  One of my contacts wrote back that it locked her 
terminal and she had to disconnect to reset.  Others loved it.

You can get the specific commands for the various terminals from the 
termcap or terminfo files on your system.

For those with ANSI-compatible terminals, I am appending the famous 
turkey message. You have to <spacebar> through it.  (You can examine the 
message for the commands used to create it.)

     DON'T READ BEYOND THIS POINT IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED FOR THE
     POSSIBILITY OF LOCKING UP YOUR TERMINAL....

Hello!

Sending international MAIL by using PINE needs the
feature of automatic selecting:
      with MIME
      without MIME  (depanding on the destination).

This can be a great help for mailuser using PINE.

A possible solution may be setting a MIME-Flag
in the addressbook.
This MIME-Flag can be filled in the moment (*) of putting a
mailaddress in the addressbook and must be checked from
PINE.

        (*)Main-Menu 'Update address book'
                     or  TakeAddr Command

What do you think about such a new feature in PINE ?????

I have pine configured with one provider (Best Internet Communications) to

.newsrc file, I'm able to read.  Now with a second provider (a2i
Communications) I am unable to get the "News-collection" working.  I tried
transferring the Best .pinerc file to a2i and still doesn't work.

Can anyone help me with the pine setup / configuration to fix this problem?

Thank you.

Hello,

about the problems concerning Reply-To: -field in customized headers...

This might not be the case discussed in here, but I found out that if
I try to set the Reply-To -address to the same from where I am
actually sending my message, Pine leaves it out.

Just for reference, I am using the following setup in my .pinerc:

  # Only show these headers (by default) when composing messages
  default-composer-hdrs=To:,
          Cc:,
          Subject:,
 
  # Add these customized headers (and possible default values) when composing
  customized-hdrs=Reply-To: Tapio Johtimo <johtimo@tele.nokia.fi>


	Happy Juhannus (Mid Summer Day)!

IS there any ways to queue up the mails you want to send first, and then 
send them all at one time.  I am using SLIP in Linux, everytime I press 
CTRL-X, I need to wait for the sendmail daemon finish sending my mail.

Ok, I got tired of waiting and spent awhile fussing with this in my
pinerc file.  I tried changing the text of the header in the customized
headers section thinking that might have an effect.  Here is what I
discovered: 

  Reply-to:  (address)       works
  Reply-To:  (address)       works
  Reply to:  and Reply To:   do NOT work  (show up as 'Reply    ')

Then I tried altering my address by adding <> brackets, adding a 
name+brackets, etc.  

All of the above produced the same results I have reported earlier: 
i.e. the 'Reply To: shows when invoking 'Rich Header' (ctrl-R) in 
compose but does NOT get saved to Fcc, nor sent in the message/news post.

Finally, I tried a completely different (but valid) address and VOILA! 
the reply-to line suddenly works as advertised.  It seems that IF the 
'Reply-to' address is the same as your 'From' address, then Pine 
suppresses it internally.  If it is different, then is allows it to pass.
(check this email and news post to see what I mean)

Thus the mystery is solved, and it is a Pine internal matter, not some 
external software issue.

However, I respectfully suggest that this 'feature' should be disabled
in the next version of Pine and the 'Reply-To' be allowed if present in
the customised header section.  I don't really care about email.  All
mail programs seem to handle replies OK.  Not all newsreaders however
interpret the 'From' correctly when replies by email are made.  I am
more concerned that I have a correct 'Reply-to:' line in news posts. 

If Pine is going to make news posts (I confess I only use Pine as an 
email program and to post simultaneous email/news, I do not use Pine to 
read news and probably never will), then I think Pine should allow me 
to structure the headers the way I want and not also do other internal 
checking and modifying/suppressing.

I appreciate your help in learning more about Pine!  Keep up the good work!

Hi All!

  We do alot of communicating via email with a company that only supports

  Unfortunately, uuencoding the attachment, executing Pine and then
importing the uuencoded attachment seems to be a bit much to remember for
my poor, overworked colleges.  Is there any seemless way to have Pine(UNIX)

Is there a way to supress display of a long distribution list 
on an outgoing/incoming message?  Is there a Pine function 
similar to Unix-mail's Bcc: ?  Thanks.

Yes. Use `{host.domain/pop3}mailboxname' folder specification. But this is
(I think) undocumented and not supported. If it is possible, use IMAP
instead.

This is not an aswer but it can help: About a month ago someone announce
here an automated bidirectonal MIME/uuencode gateway---you send there
uuencoded file (via source routing) and it continues to the receiver as a
MIME mail. And if you send a MIMEd mail, it continues as uuencoded one. I
think it COULD help.

put your address list name in the bcc: line by activating rich headers 
(^R in the header portion of the message composer) and put your address 
in the To: line (keeps the mail transfer agent from jumping to 
conclusions about what ought to be there).

The "default-composer-hdrs" doesn't work either.  I added "Reply-To:" to this
parameter in the setup menu, PINE correctly added it to the header list when I
compose a message, but the "Reply-To:" address is not included in the message
that is sent, or in the message that is stored in the "mail.sent" folder.

This seems to be a common complaint, anybody have any other ideas?

I posted that question a few weeks ago ('autoreply'), because i know that 
ELM has a feature like this. Ask your admin if there's a feature like 
'vacation' (or try 'vacation' or 'man vacation' at your system prompt) - 
PINE itself does not support that feature!

You can set it up by making it one of the regular address books of some
user, maybe root.  That user will be able to change it and so on.  Other
people can have it as one of the global-addressbooks and it will be read
only for them.  All the address books are looked at.  You don't want to
change the global address book too often when people are actually using
it, since it will confuse their pines, which will attempt to recover...

I think what you really want to do is set:
    smtp-server=sirsi.com
    use-only-domain-name=yes

Screw the reply-to fields.  Many mailers don't even support that.

    No.  There is no Internet standard for doing what you want.  Some 
private mail systems implement a receipt-upon-reading scheme, but the 
Internet as a whole does not, so there is no way you can force a remote 
computer to do it through Pine.  Sorry.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that Pine, by its 
nature, runs over IMAP2bis only.

The best thing I've found for integrating PGP with Pine is mkpgp.

It's available on the cyberpunks ftp site at berkeley.

It can be done but it is *NOT A GOOD IDEA*. Depending on lots of things, 
amongst them: 

If your mail reader is ok; 
If you have the right hardware;

Odd ascii escape sequences in your mail *MAY* produce the result you 
intended.

More often it will screw the screen up for some poor sod reading the message.

Message-Id: <3sei0p$21g@news.internetmci.com>

Ok, here's what I want to do, can anybody tell me the magic to make it happen?

I want a "reply-to" field to appear as part of the headers, so that I can type
in the reply-to on the fly.  Sometimes I'll leave it blank, which means don't
add the reply-to to the note, and sometimes I'll fill in something, like 
"hostmaster@mci.net".

I tried adding "reply-to:" to default-composer-hdrs, and it didn't work.  The field
showed up in the header, but not in the mail that was sent.

Any hints are appreciated!

Daniel

This is a repost.  I've received no response, and we had trouble with our 
newsfeed, so I'm not sure it made it out.  Apologies if you've seen it 
before.

I have an address list made up entirely of people in the local domain.  It
is my understanding that I need use only the userid of each party in the
list.  This works, mostly.  When I mail to the list, three of the
addresses in it fail and the MAILER_DAEMON mail failed message lists the 
failed addresses in this form: 

<uid@***address-loop-or-duplicate***> ... illegal character in hostname

These userids are 3, 4, and 5 characters long, and not together in the 
list, and they are not duplicates.

How can this be corrected?

Thanks.

This should mean that there is a address loop in your address book.  For
example, list1 contains list2 which contains list3 which contains list1...

If you'd like to send a copy of your address book to me I'd be happy to
take a look.  Tell me which list you're having trouble with, too.

We've seen **address loop** where a user's addressbook entry points to
the same address; for example, where foo@columbia.edu is a systemwide
sendmail alias and the user defines an addressbook entry foo for foo
(so the nickname and the real address are identical).  User's purpose
of doing this is to gather all used addresses into the addressbook,
even where the real address is memorable and the user doesn't want to
set a different nickname.  The interesting thing is that it works most
of the time and just occasionally gets a **address loop** bounce.

[Newbie questions:]

Is there anything special one has to do to specify an inbox-path to a VMS
system, e.g. special quoted characters, Unix directory syntax, etc.?  Any
other considerations?

Is there any kind of adminstrator's guide?  I'm looking for ways to limit
portions of the configuration menus, when distributing Pine to both public
and faculty/administrator's desktop PCs.

I've heard wind of an IMAP consortium.  Any news on who is participating? 
Any possibility of industrial strength IMAP client software for the Mac?

Thanks!

Theoretically (i.e meaning that I believe it would work, but I have not
actually moved folders around this way myself) you could either run
PINE under VMS and have it contact IMAPD on the SGI box, or run IMAPD
on VMS and and have your unix PINE make contact with it.
 
For experiences running Yehavi's port of VMS PINE, see:

The price is right!

There have been a couple of posts lately regarding Pine 3.91 on DG/UX. If 
anyone would like further debate on DG/UX. I am running on experimental 
DG/UX list.

To join the list, send mail to listserv@ambar.internet-eireann.ie with 
the following in the body of the message:

subscribe dgux-list joe@foo.bar.com

(assuming that your e-mail address is joe@foo.bar.com), you will then be 
added to the list and sent an introduction document.

To post to the list, send mail to dgux-list@ambar.internet-eireann.ie

Please remember that it is an experimental list and subject to 
unpredictable results.  If confused, mail 
feargal@ambar.internet-eireann.ie with your confusions.

Apologies, to all non-DG/UX people on this list ....

no, it is the same as for UNIX systems, i.e.

inbox-path={vmssystem}INBOX

you can also use

inbox-path={vmssystem}NEWMAIL

however, if you want to access other folders on VMS, you might have a 
folder-collections field like this

folder-collections=vms {vmssystem}[],
             unix {unixsystem}mail/[],
	etc...

Hi,

I am rather new to the net and hope someone can be of some help to me 
on the pine program.

If you have messages saved in a folder can they be copied to the address 
book special list.

Can you send the same message to multiple address without having to 
retype all the address.  Can this be done both in the address book and
a folder?

Please reply to tmeade@infi.net and thanks for any help.

 Of course this is invalid per the email RFC - you cannot have space in 
the header title field!
 I don't quite understand what you mean to achieve in terms of news - if 
a newsreader can't handle the 'From:' then it's broken, and may as well 
have trouble with 'Reply-To:' just the same. While I can't see why Pine 
wouldn't let it thru, it really doesn't make much sense to have superflous 
'Reply-to:' identical to the 'From:' address...

The problem exists on both SunOS4.1.3 and SunOS4.1.4, and does 
not exist on solaris2.  It does not occur with 41 addresses UNLESS 41 
LINES ARE USED.  just sending mail to bogus@eng.umd.edu, 
bogus1@eng.umd.edu, ... does not cause the problem, apparently because 
pine packs three addresses to a line.  I don't know if 41 is the minimum 
number to see the problem (that's just what I tried), but I know that 
with 41/3 (=14) lines the problem does not occur.

One last clue.  On solaris, when this bounces (as well it should - that's 
what it doesn't do on sunos because it never gets sent) it comes back 
grouped in 4 or so messages.  Perhaps that's why solaris works - for some 
reason it knows to break up messages with large headers.  Just a guess.


Thanks for any insite. All my machines are running the same (current)
sendmail also.

The way I converted VMS mail folders to Unix format was to use the "vmsmail.awk"
program attached below.  There are also several other old news articles with
other possibilities.  Note: this stuff comes with no guarantees, and a bit of
fine-tuning may be needed.  Also, it assumes you want to create a "standard"
Unix mailbox, not MMDF or MH or whatever format.

Basically, for each VMS folder:

   a) Start up VMS mail and use "EXTRACT/ALL somefile".
   b) Copy this file to your Unix system.
   c) Run "vmsmail.awk" or whatever program.
   d) You now have a Unix mail version of the folder.

Hugh.

This attached script is what I and many other people inside of Digital use.  
It only does a folder at a time, but it works. :-)

Subject: Re: vms mail --> unix mail

Status: R

You may be able to use the attached awk script. I last used it about 4
years ago when I last dealt with a VMS machine. With any luck, mail file
formats on VMS haven't changed since then and you can use the script
as is. Otherwise, it'll at least serve as a starting point. Awk isn't
too difficult to learn.

--- documentation file for vmsmail.awk ---
The awk script "vmsmail.awk" converts mail headers in a VMS 3.5 "MAIL.MAI" file
to a format that the Unix mail program can understand.

A VMS mail message begins with a header of the form

	From: USER dd-MMM-yyyy hh:mm *

where the asterisk indicates a new (unread) mail message

A Unix mail message begins with

	From USER www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy

where Www is a 3 letter abbreviation of the day of the week (first letter
capitalized), and Mmm is the month counterpart.

New Unix mail messages are unmarked.  Old (read) messages are marked with a
line of the form

	Status: RO

following the "Subj:" header line, which both VMS and Unix mail have.

Finally, an ASCII form-feed precedes each VMS mail message, but Unix mail
messages are separated by a blank line following each message.

Therefore, what the awk script has to do is
	(1) find the beginning of a VMS mail message (i.e., distinguish it
		from formfeeds and lines beginning "From:" within the body
		of a mail message), and change the message separator from
		a formfeed to a blank line.
	2) figure out what day of the week a given date corresponds to,
		and reformat the "From" header accordingly.
	3) if the message is an old/read one, insert the "Status: RO" line
		following the "Subj:" line.


The awk script starts out by setting up (a) an array of day-of-week names
indexed by integers in the range 0 to 6 inclusive (this allows modulo
arithmetic computations), (b) an array of Unix-mail format month names
indexed by VMS-mail format month names, and (c) an array showing what day of
the week the first of each month was in 1972 (a safe baseline year because
it precedes the release dates of VMS 3.5 and 4.2bsd Unix), indexed by Unix-
format month name.  The awk "BEGIN" clause has a function analogous to compile-
time initialization in C (see the awk tutorial, section 2.1).

The body of the script contains 4 pattern-match directed clauses (see section
1.2 in the awk tutorial), where the last clause is a "default" that matches
any line in the input, because it has no pattern to match.  The first 3 clauses
each look for a line beginning with a particular token.  Because awk attempts
to match each input line to EVERY clause, each clause ends with "next" to
force awk to go on to the next line of input.

Let's examine the simplest clause first and work towards the most complex.

1) Whenever a line begins with a formfeed (^L), the script simply sets a flag
	called "pagesep" (page separator).  The "^L" gets printed only if the
	next line is not the beginning of a new mail message; therefore, the
	script does not act on it immediately.  (It can't check "the previous
	line" because a VMS mail file can begin with "^L" as its first line.)

2) If a line does not begin with "From:", "Subj:" or "^L", the script checks
	to see if there is a deferred "^L" that is within the body of a mail
	message (pagesep = 1 and newmsg = 0; newmsg = 1 as long as the script
	is dealing with mail headers), and if so prints the "^L" and unsets
	"pagesep" before it prints the current line.

3) If the line begins with the token "Subj:", it gets printed.  Then if the
	"newmsg" flag is still on, indicating that this is a header line,
	the string "status" gets printed and the script unsets "newmsg".
	"status" is set in the remaining clause:

4) If an input line begins with the token "From:", the script first checks to
	see if "pagesep" is set.  If not, this line is just a line within the
	body of a mail message, so it gets printed.  Otherwise, the script
	prints a blank line message-separator, unsets "pagesep", and sets
	"newmsg" to 1 to indicate that it found the start of a new message.
	Then, it sets the string variable "status" to "Status: RO" if the input
	line didn't have an asterisk (fewer than 5 tokens), or empty otherwise.
	Next, it extracts the date, month and year, translating VMS' all-caps
	month name to the Unix equivalent.  Finally, it calculates the day of
	the week, and prints the Unix-format "From" line.

Subject: VMS mail <---> Unix mail
Status: RO

        Hi Jia:
        The only way you would be able to preserve the folder information
        is to place each folder in a separate Unix file.  The VMS mail
        file (MAIL.MAI) is an indexed sequential file.  Short mail messages
        (1,536 or less bytes in length) are stored in MAIL.MAI.  There is
        a fourth block associated with each message that contains the
        overhead associated with the indexed file; one portion of that
        overhead is a secondary key -- the folder name.

        Since Unix doesn't support indexed files, it would seem very
        difficult to transport the folder concept from VMS to Unix.
        I suppose you could make separate files for each folder (I believe
        that the Berkeley mail tool does this), but that implies some
        file gymnastics on the Unix side.

        I hope this is of some help!

        Best regards

        - Kipp -

Actually, the pop3 driver is not built into PC-Pine as distributed...

 The control key you're looking for is right there: 
'^X To Matching Grps', 
which gives you all when pressed on the blank line (of course, it may be 
a bit too cryptic, so some local info provided can help). Starting 
with something like news.newuser.announce (and/or local equivalent) could be 
done by adding an initial .newsrc to each newly created home directory - 
I think you'd need that no matter what news-collection you put in the 
.pinerc, anyway (the collection only has the matching entries from .newsrc)!

Subject: Creating address lists outside of pine
Date: 23 Jun 1995 16:06:44 -0600
Message-Id: <3sfdtk$9t9@park.uvsc.edu>

I want to create a mailing list in pine, but I'd like to be able to
edit the address file outside of pine with say vi.  I've got a file that
contains the email address for about 50 people.  I tried bringing those
addresses into .addressbook using vi and encasing them in () with each
seperated with commas.

I do this and then save .addressbook.  When I enter the address book
in pine I get a message that .addressbook.lu is invalid and I am assuming
it gets rebuilt.  However, the addresses are all jumbled up and can't be
used.

Ideas?  Is there a limit to the size of a mailing and is it possible to
edit the .addressbook in this way.  I was able to add a single alias
address using vi, but it croked on the mailing list try.

Apology-in-advance if this is covered in the FAQ - I haven't found the 
FAQ yet...


Q: What should "news-collections" be set to for new Pine users?

Context:
We've been running Pine 3.91 here for awhile (THANK YOU for creating and 
updating it - great software, "Just Works", even with NIS+, multiple mail 
servers, and non-standard sendmail config) and recently started running 
NetNews.

I'm trying to decide what their default .pinerc should have for 
"news-collections".  I think the reasonable choices are "News" (list all 
groups) or "Subscribed-Groups" (just list the ones to which they're 
subscribed).

Since these people have never used News on this system before, they won't 
be subscribed to any groups when they start.  So if I start them with 
"Subscribed...", they won't see any, and won't know what to do, and won't 
know the names of the available groups, and will be generally lost 
(after all, they *are* "just" users, and get lost easily...  :-)  )

Starting them off with "News" solves the "lost" problem, but many of them 
will never get out of News "mode" into "Subsc..." mode.  Using it 
regularly this way is very awkward, and I will have many unhappy users. :(

So: I'd like to start them in "Subscribed..." mode, but also have a 
command which lists the available *Unsubscribed* groups.  Best of all:
when you use 'A' to subscribe, and Pine asks "Which newsgroup", have a 
control key which lists them and lets you select one.

Is this available and I missed it?  Is there a better approach to the 
problem?

Thanks.

Oh! I see... Sorry for my ignorance. Thank you.

But I like to use Pine's IMAP more, as I can read the folders in my home 
directory. :>

That means there will also be "offline" IMAP support? That's great.

 The adressess indeed need to be in a comma-separated list enclosed in () 
- one important thing is to precede it with two TABs, because the format is:

<Nickname>^I<Full name>^I(<list>) 

 The other tricky thing is that several hundred characters can be 
squeezed into a line, but if that's got too many than Pine mangles it. You 
can break it down into many lines, but the continuing ones have to start 
with a space!

 You can eliminate Pine's complaint about the lookup file (and its 
possible mangling the book while trying to rebuild it) by just deleting 
the .addressbook.lu file after editing .addressbook!

Hi all,

We're using pine 3.87 and 3.91 on HP-UX 9.0 and 9.01.  Pine hangs when accessing

Robert,
I think the VMS experts have already answered your first question.

As to an administrator's manual, the closest approximation right now is
the Pine Tech Notes:
  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/tech-notes.txt

As for an IMAP consortium, there are plans.  I'll put you on the list of
interested parties.

You might also want to look at:

 ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.software

The leading Mac IMAP clients at the moment seem to be Baylor's Mail Drop
and Esys Corp's Simeon, both fairly "young", but under active development.

Here are the facts:

Pine 3.91 has POP3 support, in that it will use POP3 as if it were IMAP
(only the Deleted status is meaningful, and if you don't expunge then all
the flags get cleared).

The syntax is a /pop3 switch inside the network spec, e.g. {server/pop3}.
POP3 doesn't support folders, so no folder name is needed.

However, 3.91's POP3 code has a rather serious bug in memory management
which keeps it from being very useful; it's likely to crash if you try it.
If you rebuild 3.91 using the imap-3.6.BETA toolkit (instead of the 3.5
version that's distributed with 3.91), it'll fix this bug.

There is *no* POP3 offline support in 3.91.  POP3 offline support will
appear in the future, as an incidental of IMAP4 disconnected support.

     NOTES
          If a MIME message is forwarded using a non-MIME compliant
          mailer, its MIME encoding will not be recognized.  To fix
          this, save the message as a file and edit the file.  Look
          for the first Content-Type: mail header, and copy that
          header into the first "paragraph" of mail headers, somewhere
          after its first line.

(Then use munpack.)

Hope this helps,

Date: 24 Jun 1995 01:18:59 GMT
Message-Id: <3sfp63$31q@wn.aksi.net>

Sorry if this is a FAQ, I run Pine under Linux (Slackware 2.1.0) and am having
a problem (that I probably cause <ughhh!>)...

Yes that dreaded "Folder is Readonly...Folder is Locked...by another Process".
Nothing seems to fix this problem, which only affects regular users (not root).

Shutting down and rebooting doesn't fix it, and I cannot seem to find any
lock files.  The man-page for "pine" (man pine) refers to:

Per Folder Lock Files:   /tmp .\usr\spool\mail\****

(sorry if I am a complete idiot, but I don't even understand this convention of
 referring to a file <or path?> with the slashes going in the other direction???
 What does that mean?  I don't find any files other than the mail files for each
 username in /usr/spool/mail (symbolic link to /var/spool/mail)... and I don't
 understand what is meant by this switch in *slashes*.  Isn't that DOS type
 slashes ?)

Any help would be appreciated!  As I mentioned - I probably did something
stupid as root (ooops! Sysadmin BOOT CAMP here :-)

We had to worry about locking files with cc:mail installation.  There was 
something your had to enable in PC-NFS to enable locking.  When 
attaching, you selected and 'advanced' option and clicked on something 
like enalble lock manager.  (I'm not at work, so I can't be more exact. :{

Hi,

I've got Pine and PC-Pine for Windows working.

When I send a message from PC-Pine however, the mail goes to the intended 
recipient BUT I also get a copy of the message sent to me in my INBOX.

Is this a feature or a bug? I've checked all the standard stuff (i.e., I 
don't have any weird forwarding going on, and the Fcc field shouldn't be 
causing it.)

If I send the identical message from the UNIX machine using Pine, I don't 
get the copy, it behaves properly.

ANyone experienced this before?? Any ideas?

The Plus Pack adds Internet POP Mail functionality to Exchange.  It 
serves as a very nice e-mail client which even lets you preview your

Hello!
This may be a dumb question, but I cannot find the answer in FAQs or
anywhere else...  How can users be notified when someone sends them
mail without having to exit the application program that they are
using (like WRITE)?  I note that with the standard MAILCHECK=nn
system, users are only notified if they are at a shell prompt and then
only after they hit ENTER.  How can the users be notified of new mail
in the same manner that the WRITE command interrupts application
programs?

I did this and it does work!  I think part of your problem is you don't
know the format being used in the addressbook.  I created one entry and
then vi the addressbook.  I found each field (3) were seperated by a 
tab.  So I read my addressbook in, changed it to the format used by
addressbook and then saved.  I then did a sort on the addressbook just
for personal desire.  It worked fine.  All the e-mail address I have
been keeping on my pc have been intergrated into my addressbook on my
ISP's box.

Help!  Is there a simple explanation (for simple folk) on how to get a file 
from word processing into pine and send that same document as an attachment?
And knowing that, is there a simple way to learn how to get an attachment from 
pine into the word processor to read?  

Any assistance would be appreciated - I'll trade my first born son or 
something.  Please respond as you would to a child, "You take the little 
mouse..."

Thanks in advance,

Message-Id: <3siot0$koo@news.blkbox.com>

Have a question.  When I use pico with pine, pico works much better than 
any other time.  When I just use pico for a file, or with elm, etc., when 
I scroll down a page, all the text gets all jumbled, and I have to 
re-draw the screen with ctrl-l every time I go down a page.  However, 
when I'm composing a message with pine, pico behaves just fine, and I 
never have to redraw the screen.  Any idea why this is?  Does pine do 
something to correct this, and if so, what?  I'd certainly like to know.  
Please email me if you've any idea, thanks.

PINE seems to hate long lists.  I tried to send to a list of 500+ and we
got no result.  The To: line was self-addressed and we never received it. 
The list was included in bcc and we got no error message but none of the
intended recipients received the mail.  Subsequently, we divided the list
into 9 sections and mail was successfully delivered and we got bounced
mail messages, etc.  We now use Solaris 2.x which seems to hate long
lists.  We once used  Sun OS4.x and lists of several hundred were ok.

I use Pine on a provider's Unix system, and 
insert sigs manually for each message.

I have more than one signature, and have placed
each in a little file called aasig or ihsig, 
something easy to remember and easy to type.

Each sig file is placed in my home directory. I 
left the file Signature empty so it will not
automatically place something else in the message.

At the end of my message I press ^r and type the
sig name, and it pops into the message.

I need to forward my mail from a VMS machine.  I created the .forward

	I use Reply-to headers frequently when I send messages to email
lists.  Many lists are set up so that the reply automatically goes back
to the list.  When I want to be sure that the replies come to me rather
than cluttering up the email list (e.g., if I offer to send people a 
file, or I want to post a questionnaire), I put a Reply-to header that

 	I use Reply-to headers frequently when I send messages to email
 lists.  Many lists are set up so that the reply automatically goes back
 to the list.  When I want to be sure that the replies come to me rather
 than cluttering up the email list (e.g., if I offer to send people a 
 file, or I want to post a questionnaire), I put a Reply-to header that
 directs the reply to me rather than to the list (the last thing most lists
 need are 50 "please send me your file" messages).  If in fact Pine doesn't
 permit the Reply-to address to be the same as the From address, I think 
 that's an error that should be corrected in the next version.  (This may

I've been waiting for a Macintosh (or Power Macintosh) version of Pine 
since the beginning of time, but to no avail... :(

You'll have to use a Mac-specific appl, such as Eudora, etc...

This can mean several things:
 
Pine was installed from the pre-compiled binary, which looks for the 
.conf files in /usr/local/lib (as opposed to being compiled on your 
system with some other location specified).
 
And/or /user/local/lib doesn't exist on your machine.
 
And/or /usr/local/lib exists, but the .conf files aren't there.
 
Same thing happened here, where I used the pre-compiled binaries due to
too many problems trying to compile Pine 2.91 from the source code under
Solaris 2.3.  I had to create /usr/local/lib, then create the .conf files
from scratch. 
  
> and how about pine.conf.fixed, what is that all about?
 
pine.conf and pine.conf.fixed are both systemwide default configuration 
files.  The settings in pine.conf can be overridden by individual users 
via the "CS" command (or by manually editing .pinerc).  The settings in 
pine.conf.fixed are "fixed", i.e. they theoretically can't be overridden 
by individual users.  I say "theoretically" because some of them 
apparently _can_ be overridden under somew circumstances.

Where did you add that? In the build shell? 
Or in any subdirectory of the root of pine3.91?

I don't seem to get it to work with sol2.4.


I get an error somewhere later, with a rename redefinition. Any idea?

Can anybody tell me how to do this? 
Please try to explain in as simple terms as you can find, I'm not real

Please respond by e-mail.

Has anyone found a found a way to incorporate PGP and Pine v3.91?
I do not want to store my Password in the configuration file of PGP.
If I pipe an encrypted message to PGP, I must enter the password,
however, Pine doesn't let me see any messages regarding entering pass
phrases from PGP...

machines for my users to login to. One of these machines is my smtp 
server. This smtp server routes ALL e-mail to the correct user based on a 
alias file on it. I have done this so that all e-mail has one domain 
address that does not include the hosts name. This makes it more flexible 
if I have to move users home directories to other machines. Their e-mail 
will not have to be changed. 

My question is: do I need to create a pop 
server on each actual machine the users login to or can I have the 
same smtp machine also be my pop server. I need to know what to tell the 
users when they configure software like eudora and it asks for the 
address of the pop server.



Thanks for any advice.

Jim

on VMS, you get into VMS MAIL with the MAIL command, and then type

SET FORWARD newaddress

note that the newaddress may be of may formats:

	NODE::name
	"IN%""user@system.name"""
	"SMTP%""user@system.name"""

depending on how mail gets to your new system.

THe best way to do this is to create 2 or more signature files and
use ^r to read them into your message.

This is almost certainly a problem with the mail transport and not Pine.
Sendmail is known to have problems when its internal buffers overflow and
other MTAs may have similar problems...

I'm not sure why everytime I need to print from pine, the font size I get 
is so large as to losing as much as a quarter of a page. This does not 
happen whenever I need to print from a windows" program. How could I 
change the configuration on my printer? Anyone's prompt reply will be 
very much appreciated. Thanks! Ed.

If you set "nntp-server" to the name of your NNTP server and leave
"news-collections" blank, Pine will use an appropriate default for
news-collections.  For a system-wide default, set this in the
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf file.  There should not be any need to create
default .pinerc files, Pine will do that the first time each user runs it.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  The name of a news-collection has
nothing to do with what is subscribed or which newsgroups are listed.
Pine will always list only the groups marked as subscribed in the user's
.newsrc file, regardless of the name of the collection.

Hello,

We are running Pine 3.91 under Solaris 2.4.  We have had no problems with 
Pine until today.  For no good reason (using old pine binary and old 
pine.conf file), the addresses in the addressbook screen only show the 
one word nickname.  The full name and email fields are not being 
displayed. I don't know what has changed with my system, but I would 
appreciate any tips on how to fix this problem.  I would like to see all 
of the address information on the screen when I use work with the 
addressbook file.

Well, you passed the biggest hurdle.  Just edit the text the same way you
created the signature file, then start Composing, fill in the headers
(To:, Subject:, etc) and press ^R in the body of the message.  You will be
prompted to enter the name of the file you edited...

I had this happen to me once.  What had happened is I had more than one
pine session running at a time and the first had control of the folder.
I exited both and still could not get control back till I killed the pid.
Good luck.

Here's another question:

* How can I put commas in a customized header?  In Unix Pine
  I use environment variables, e.g., $ORGANIZATION - do env
  variable work in PC Pine?  Even if they do, I'm curious
  how to put commas in a customized header without using
  an env variable.

Thanks much,
Nancy

Message-Id: <3sn3sl$5k5@news1.wolfe.net>

I have a few questions about using PC Pine for Windows with a PPP 
connection.

* When I specify the folder directory that's on my host, to be accessed
  with IMAP, what is the best host name to use?  Both the shell (e.g.,
  {shell.foo.com}Folders/[]) and the smtp host (e.g., {mail.foo.com}Folders/[]) 
  work but I'm wondering which is better, or if it matters.  These have
  different IP numbers, so they really do seem to be different.

* Is it possible to have Pine running more than once?  When I try to start
  Pine a second time by double clicking on the Pine icon, it just maximizes
  the already running version of Pine.  I'd like to be able to run one Pine
  to access one host and another Pine to access another host.  I realize
  I could use the incoming-folders and folder-collections variables to specify
  different hosts, but I'd like to be able to access them simultaneously.

* Is there a compiled version of pcpine_w that lets you change the From header?

Please post any tips you have for using PC Pine for Windows!

Thanks,
Nancy

    Okeedoke, I'm still messing with mutiple INBOXes, and I still can't 
get it to work. Is it possible to direct mail from a certain person (ie. 
mail address: name@site.domain) to a specific INBOX. I did receive a 
helpful example for diverting mail under a certain subject heading to a 
specific box, but that won't work in my situation. 
    I also tried setting up this INBOX system I was described with 
subject heading diverting, however, that actualy didn't work either. It 
seemed logical (going into .pinerc and adding an incoming_folders 
statement...."Blah Blah Subject" mail/blah....). However, when I had a 
message sent to me with the subject line, it still went to default INBOX, 
and when I decided to select the "blah" folder, it said folder does not 
exist. Then when I decided to create the folder myself with vi (just made 
a blank file) the folders where there, but still not having the 
appropriate messages sent to them, and they were also read only, which 
isn't good either.
    Well, I still would like to have mail from specific mail addresses 
(in this case a mailing list from a listserver) diverted to an 
appropriate folder. Thanks for any help....

Understandable, sorry I forgot to mention a change in another file.
Here it goes, hopefully more succesfull. Note that I am using gcc, 2.3.3, and
may have different organisation of include files that you have. Here is what I
did:

0) This works only for pine, a similar problem exist for imapd.

1) Used the build script
      build CC=gcc sol

2) Edited the file pine/makefile.sol around line 80, by adding -DANSI,
   so it looks like this:
   
   # Use these for the gcc compiler
   # Yep, marc
   CC=	gcc
   CFLAGS=	-DSV4 $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\" -DANSI

3) Changed around line 194 from

BAD:    /*----------------- Are we ANSI?----------------------------------*/
BAD:    /* #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */  
BAD:    #define	const		/* compiler doesn't support const */

    to
/*----------------- Are we ANSI? ---------------------------------------*/
/* Changed ma, using gcc which is ansi and understand const */
/* #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */

#ifndef ANSI
#define	const		/* compiler doesn't support const */
#endif

   
4) In pine subdirectory
    make -f makefile.sol


If you want to track the error down, then try in the pine directory:

gcc -E -DSV4   -g -DDEBUG -DSYSTYPE=\"SOL\"  -c  addrbook.c | grep "rename(" 

This is the command issued from makefile.sol. The -E option sends the
preprocessor output to stdout, and grep rename searches for defintions of
rename.
Output is:

extern int      rename(const char *, const char *);
extern int rename(  char *,   char *);

Hello,

I know that I can compose a letter from the command line using pine then 
the address directly following it, but is there a way that I can use the 
same quick compose method to post to a newsgroup?  My newsgroup header is 
considered part of the customized-headers field and has to be invoked 
using ^R everytime I want to post.  Is there a quicker way?

I've setup a VT100 (possible upgraded to a VT125 by the startup screen?),

works except Pine, which starts to paint the screen then just hangs and
I have to kill the process from the console.  Any suggestions aside

Try rebuilding Pine with the latest IMAP2bis toolkit, version 3.6.BETA,
from ftp.cac.washington.edu, mail/imap.tar.Z  Some bugs were fixed between
version 3.5 (which Pine 3.91 ships with) and 3.6

Subject: Problem with berzerk mailbox handling

I have a problem using pine. It seems that sendmail sometimes doesn't place
a blank line between the last message and the 'From user@host <date>' line
that marks the beginning of the next message. Pine is able to correctly
locate the 'From user@host <date>' line but it removes the last NL character
from the previous message. Thus when the message is exported or piped to a
command (e.g. when using ftpmail), the last line isn't terminated with a
NL and causes all sorts of problems. The worst is when I tag 2 messages and
pipe them to a command, the first line of the 2nd message is concatinated
onto the last line of the 1st message.

So my question is, has anybody else seen this and possibly fixed (or hacked
it if sendmail is at fault) it. I believe the fix needs to be in the
c-client but I havn't found the correct place to add it. I simply want to
append a NL if the last character in the message isn't already a NL.

Thanks.

Hi,
	This may have been covered before but I did not see it.  We have
used Pine for UNIX for quite some time.  Recently we installed PCPINE for
Windows and that works fine (both reading and sending mail).  For some
other clients we want to install PCPINE for DOS using WATTCP.  We have
installed this and can read mail fine but cannot send mail since PINE
cannot find our SMTP server even though it is the same system it read its
mail from and the name we provide works fine for PCPINE for Windows.

	Can anyone explain this discrepency to me and provide a solution?
Thanks for helping out.

Coenraad Bakker

Using three folder collections, the first local, and the second two remote
(VMS), I noticed the following behaviour using Pine 3.91 for Unix:

I open the second remote folder collection and see all the expected
folders.  I open one of the folders, and see messages.  I then use the
L[ist folders command, and see my three collections, each with the Select
Here to See Expanded List "button".  I then move up to the second remote
collection, and press return on the button, but I see the folders from the
third collection.  If I attempt to view the contents of one of the folders,
it is empty.  From there, I List folders again, press return to expand the
list, and voila, the correct folders appear in the collection as expected.

Anyone seen this before?

        Please summarize for the list (or at least tell me) if you 
    ever get any leads on a worthwhile manual. The context-sensitive 
    help is fine as far as it goes, but the so-called online manual is
    utterly hopeless: written for supernerds, and impossible to find 
    anything in ...

Subject: imap installation,  POP3 installation.

I have installed imapd on one of my servers.  I now would like to do the 
following:
	let users access the server without logging in.

I have several Unix boxes (BSDI v2.0).  My system is composed of 10 boxes.  Of 
these, users log into 5 of them.  The others are news, web, ftp, and dns.  
Users do not login to these boxes.  I would like the mail server (10th box) to 
allow users to retrieve mail without using a password or login name.  Is this 
possible?  Is there anything out there that will handle this?

I have done the following:
	1.  installed imapd
	2.  configured the services and inetd
	3.  copied the passwd file from the 5 boxes to the mail server
	4.  configured and installed POP3
	5.  added the line {mailserver.laser.net}INBOX to pine.conf.fixed file

We only use Pine 3.91 at our site (POP3 was installed for some of our framed 
clients).  

Thanks

If both machines have the same folders, one of them is probably NFS
mounting from the other (or a third).  Getting NFS out of the look is
always recommended.

Not that I am aware of.  You can change the username and user-domain in
PC-Pine though...

You can include commas in a quoted string, e.g.

The next steps are to

	6. Configure the mailserver to allow rsh connections
	7. Disable direct logins (change login shell in /etc/passwd,
	turn off telnetd/rlogind, move telnetd to a hidden port, etc)
	8. link imapd to /etc/rimapd on the mail server

I jus edited myself a signature file, and send a message to myself to see 
if it worked. The message arrived with signature.

But then i posted to a test group, and there the signature did not 
appear, even though I saw it appended to my article before I posted. Why?

Please e-mail if you can explain this.

You can find any such items at the Pine home site. The docs, in particular are

There's an excellent program called Mail Drop which does MIME and IMAP on the

It sure is frustrating to have a fine program like PINE and PICO, with
no installation instructions- at least no *complete* installation
instructions.  Sometimes PINE works, sometimes it doesn't...  but MAIL
always works.  Some of my PINE users get their mail, others only get
it sometimes...  The screen often fills up with garbage when choosing
C to compose.

Can anyone shed any light on this situation?  I really want to use
PINE, it's much nicer than MAIL....  except it doesn't work reliably.
I have checked all the documentation at the FTP site, the web site,
and here on the USENET, to no avail....

Why don't you advertise somewhere else?  USENET isn't supposed to be
junk mail.  Product announcements are one thing, but a whole damn
catalog is abusing the forum and disrespecting your potential
customers.

Had a student ask me a question on pine today.  The secretary of a 
student activity group sends meeting notices with Pine 3.91.  She uses 
the address book feature to define a group with the addresses 
of 200+ members.  What she would like to know is if there is anyway to 
suppress the printing of all 200+ address in the header of the mail 
message.  A receiver of the message may have to scroll thru 200 lines of 
mail addresses just to read a one line message, "meeting at 8".  I'm 
cross-posting to comp.mail.sendmail since this may be a sendmail issue.  
(We are running sendmail version 5.64 which came with our RS/6000.)

I am a very loyal user of pine, but am displeased with the 
lack of upgrades in the past year (almost).  Is there any hope 
for a new version of pine?  Especially one that includes a 
true window (either X11, MS-Win, or Apple) interface.  If a 
new version is planned, as it would appear by all the people 
asking for features in the next release, when might this next 
release appear?

Either create a sendmail alias for all 200 addresses, or have the secretary

In qualcomm's qpopper.
It's very good POP server and I can recomend you to take a look
at it. ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com or http://www.qualcomm.com.

BTW UIDL command is very good for synchronization.

Hi,
 I am new to this newsgroup. Can anyone tell me where to get a copy of 
PC-Pine for Windows 3.91. This maybe answered but can PC-Pine allow me to 
read news from the nntp server?

I uses the Trumpet winsock to establish a ppp connection with my internet 
provider. Other  requirements do I need in order for PC-Pine to work.


Thanks in advance.

I asked the same question of my server, InterAccess in Illinois, and was 
told that they had to do it.  It took them less than ten minutes and I 
was up and running with a new name.  Some Windows based programs have 
their own profile files so you still have to make changes in them, if you 
use any.

Hi,

I am new in this group, since I work with pine only for a few weeks.

My question is:

If I am mailing to a group of about 60 people, some of the mails come
back with an error message:

554 <kachel@physik.rwth-aachen.de>... unbalanced '<'
554 <abc@def.ghj.de>... unbalanced '<'
...

What can I do to avoid this?

Cheers
Ralf

Hello!

 Some days ago I got Pine. After several trials at last I made run but I still
cannot read the news by pine. 
 My config looks like this:
personal-name          = Slawomir Tengowski
user-domain            = tengowski@coli.uni-sb.de
smtp-server            = <No Value Set>
nntp-server            = coli.uni-sb.de
inbox-path             = /var/mail/tengowski
folder-collections     = /beige/CIP/tengowski/Mail/[]

whenever I want to access the newsfolder pine prints:
[Can't open mailbox /var/spool/news/comp: no such folder]

 I have read the manuals but it was very quickly frustrating - I could not make it run. Does somebody have similar experiences but did it finally? Can somebody help?

Thanx! Yours, Tengo!   


PS:And something for smiling:

How would you change your name that is shown in the newsgroups. Do you do 
it through Pine?

PC-Pine for Windows is in

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine/pcpine_w.zip

It does support NNTP.

Your provider needs to provide IMAP access to your INBOX and any other
folders you keep on that system.

Are you in a Unix environment?  Pine is great for mail, but tin is the 
way to go for news.  It's easy to use and hardly ever has problems.

Try this...
Get into SETUP CONFIGURATION mode in your pine program...
..and at the bottom of the list, you set:

character-set          = iso-8859-1

That's IT!

How do I configure pine so that one can send/receive
the iso-8859-1 character-set in headers too?

- Maybe one have to rewrite the code!? :-/

Please mail me, cos I usually don't read this newsgroup!

	Does anyone know of any documentation on Pine and/or Pico in Japanese?  The only 
thing I have found so far is a translation of Internet Instant Reference bye Paul E. Hoffman 
(the original not the translation). There are a few pages in it on Pico and Pine.  It would 
help me in explaining to my students if there were more in Japanese somewhere.

Message-Id: <3ss8g2$q51@news.csus.edu>

Hi,

We are running Pine 3.91 on several Sparc 20 servers with Solaris 2.3 as 
the operating system and the Transarc Andrew File System 3.3 for 
sharing user file systems.  The /var/mail directory is NFS mounted from our
mailbox server to the Sparc 20 servers.  Pine works fine for sending and 
reading mail. 

However, several users have complained that when they try to save messages
to their own folders, some of the messages are not saved into these mail
folders.  I've sent mail to pine-bug and consulted their FAQ material and
did not get any information.  Does anyone have this type of environment and
problem ?  Any suggestions on what could cause this type of problem ? 
Thanks.

Six of the seven POP3 servers mentioned in replies to my earlier query
on comp.mail.mime support UIDL.  They are:

Cyrus pop3d 1.3
IMAP toolkit 4.0 ipop3d

SPOTmail POP3 Server WinNT

 Looks like you misconfigured the NNTP connection - if you reside on 
coli.uni-sb.de and the same machine is the news-server, then you wouldn't 
need NNTP (and the news would come from /var/spool/news). You need to 
find someone knowledgeable about your local news setup to tell you what's 
the proper NNTP address, if any.
 Incidentally, you set your 'user-domain' wrong, too: it should not 
contain the username!

Hi I was wondering someone could help me out with this... I'm trying to 
install procmail on my account, and having all sorts of problems. I 
changed the base directory to my own in Makefile, and when I type make 
install, here's what I get:

/bin/sh ./initmake /bin/sh "/usr/local/bin/is" "/bin/rm -f" "mv -f" "ln"  
"-lm -
ldir -lx -lsocket -lnet -linet -lnsl_s -lnsl_i -lnsl -lsun  -lgen

"procmail l

procmailsc p
rocmailex" "src man"  "/home/g/grk2237/bin"
Warning: perverted make detected
Whoeaaa!  There's something fishy going on here.
You have a look and see if you detect anything uncanny:
*******************************************************

I suggest you take a look at the definition of CFLAGS* and CC

Any suggestions? Thanks!

hi all,

I don't get any mails from pine-info@cac.washington.edu since a week or 
so. However I can read the news in comp.mail.pine.

Was the cross-posting between pine-info@cac.washington.edu and 
comp.mail.pine cancelled?

thanks for any info

Well, that _would_ be it if the user's terminal/emulation was
set to display the iso-8859-1 code.  If it isn't correctly set,
PINE will have no idea, and the results could be rather confusing.
 
One quite likely scenario is a terminal emulation that's set to
display 7-bit characters, ignoring the 8th bit.  PINE is _not_
itself in control of the terminal emulation.  It's the user's job
to make sure that the character set that they setup in the PINE config
is compatible with the terminal emulation they are using.  And for
users that move around a lot, and may log on from some unknown
terminal emulation in, say, someone else's office, this is a source
of considerable confusion.
 
I note that you are posting from Sweden.  Presumably, most of the
terminals that you use are already configured to iso-8859-1.  In a
world-wide context, though, this could be the exception rather than
the rule.
 
best regards

Vacation is a unix command that is normally issued from the unix prompt. 
It makes use of the forwarding function to send an automatic reply.
(I suspect you are on a unix type system.)

Hope this helps,

Okay, after beating sendmail into submission, we're ready to install a 
set of MUA's for our office.  Here's the scoop.

We've got one SVR4.2 server, a stand-alone PPP router, and about 40 
Windows workstations.  The only people that would need an MUA on the 
server would be myself and the other admin; for this purpose, I was 
looking into installing Pine, because I've used it on my school account 
(this one, in fact), and like it muchly.

On the Windows workstations, we would like to install a Windows native 
MUA, such as Eudora.  The Windows MUA *must* be extremely user-friendly, 
as the users around here demand it.  For this, then, we would need to 
install POP3 on our server.

Here's my question.  Can IMAP service coexist with POP3 service?  Am I 
asking for trouble?

And on another line: Is PC-Pine character based, or does it have all the 
nifty Windows things that the users in my office need?

Please email responses, and I'll summarize and repost.  Thanks!

	I've been trying to use ^K, ^U, and ^^ for cutting & pasting -- 
especially for cutting a new address out of the body of a message and 
putting it into another message, or into my addressbook. 
	At first, everything seemed to work fine. Now, all of a sudden, 
when I get to where I want the paragraph, or the address, or whatever, ^U 
doesn't do anything. I figured out that I have to be in compose, reply, 
or forward mode (rather than just viewing a message) to cut; and I have 
to leave that message extant (postpone it, not cancel it). And if I want 
to copy into the addressbook, say, I have to have the prompt up to copy 
into. 
	But there must be one more constraint, that I was satisfying 
before and have messed up. We haven't switched versions recently: still 
on pine 3.91 ...

Names with punctuation require quotes around them.
Remove the punctuation from the name, and the quotes disappear.

Certainly.  Both the c-client and Cyrus IMAP servers come with
compatibility POP3 servers.

Since you don't seem to have a significant number of users who can log
into your mail server, the Cyrus IMAP server may be closer to your
needs.  See http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd/

I have a problem concerning Pine 3.91 and after a couple of times loading 
it up and reading mail, it resets the .pinerc file.  Is this some kind of 
bug that was solved a while ago?

A "." (period) is a special character, and requires your name to be in quotes.
If you take out the period the quotes will go away.  This is not a restriction
to PINE, but a restriction in SMTP.

    Remove the period or keep the quotes.  Unfortunately, 
you can't have it both ways.

Subject: Comments on Siren Mail?
Date: Thu, 29 Jun 1995 16:11:55 GMT
Message-Id: <3sujen$1hdf@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

We're looking right now at the commercial IMAP Windows mail client
Siren Mail from Siren Software ("a division of Vicor, Inc.").  So far,
although we've seen some things that we feel need addressing, the user
interface is nicer than ANYTHING else we've seen from the IMAP client
end, and (finally) starts to approach some of the nicer interfaces of
other LAN-based (non-SMTP/POP/IMAP based) mail packages.

Right now, our campus has approximately 7,000 folks using DaVinci
email across campus.  For a variety of reasons, even though I'm the
one who got 'em there quite a few years ago, it's time now to move
them to an IMAP-based approach .... however, without a user interface
more like what they've got now, they're gonna break my kneecaps if I
propose moving to anything less.

So ..... the short question is, anyone else looked at Siren Mail?  If
so, any comments, thoughts, feedback?

Thanks.

Message-Id: <horizon-2906951747440001@vyger316.nando.net>

Does anyone know of a reliable method to conduct a survey, including
closed- and open-ended questions, via conventional e-mail connections?  I
work for an educational research company that needs to track the responses
of a group of teachers as they go through a training/enrichment project in
another state.  It would save us a lot of postage and clerical costs if
they could fill out the questionnaires we have planned via email, but I'm
worried about ease-of-use (for them) and reliability (for us).  We'd
eventually want to funnel the responses into a SAS dataset.

I've thought of a few ASCII based forms, but they seem awfully crude.  I
can't expect these people to grapple with binhex or uuencoding, either. 
Any suggestions, whether freeware, shareware, commercial, or creative? 
Thanks in advance.

Michael

Looking at the source, Pine 3.91 decides how to `MIME label' a file one
attaches to a message being created by peeking at the first few bytes,
and checking these against a few built-in file types it knows about. 

Are there any plans for Pine to support the (arguably more flexible)
`mime.types' mechanism, whereby the labelling for given file types may
be configured externally by the user, in just the same way as the viewer
for received mail may be configured with `mailcap' ?

POP3 most definitely can delete mail on a UNIX server mail spool. It can't
keep various client mail databases in sync, how could it? That will be
implemented different for each client.

I wrote my on UNIX POP3 client software using a dos shareware starting point.
I receive my mail, then I delete my mail. What's the problem?
If I had a UNIX account on the server the mail would not be there after
it was downloaded.
If I chose to receive it and not delete it POP3 can support that too.

Well, seems like whenever you have a non-letter character, PINE will put 
the whole thing in quotes, and that's why you got the quotes ...

Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9506301020.D635-0100000@poseidon.ifctr.mi.cnr.it>

I use a script to print Pine mail messages (with the Y command). The 
script formats the message (header and body), converts it to postscript 
and places a running header on each page.
Currently I put there the originator userid, the mail date, and the subject.

I will find useful to put there also the folder the mail was in, and the 
sequence number of the message in the folder.

Is there some undocumented way of making that available to the printing 
script ? I'm currently using Pine 3.89 (waiting for 3.92).

When I reply to a message that has attachments, the text that is
included from "original message" doesn't handle Quoted Printable
characters correctly. It looks like this (in Swedish :-):

----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Mime-Version: 1.0
      Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=iso-8859-1
      Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE

As you can see the new text I have written is OK, but the included
text has been QP-ed TWO times:

         1) the swedish characters (from iso-8859-1) have been
            QP-ed, eg: '' ---> '=E4'
         2) the equal-character has been QP-ed: '=E4' ---> '=3DE4'


This problem doesn't oocur if the original message doesnt have
an attachment.

I think the problem is that PINE for some reason dosn't understand
that the included text is in "iso-latin-1". For example if I only send
the included text and don't write any new iso-latin-1 characters, the
message is delivered as:

      Mime-Version: 1.0
      Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII


Is this a well-known problem ?
Is there any patch for this ?

I must have accidentally typed control Z or control S. My pine program is 
"stopped," according to the output of the ps command in UNIX, but I was 
in the middle of a huge letter! 

When I restart pine, I get a new process that is readonly. How can I resume
or restart the old process and get my letter back on the screen? I can't 
find this in the docs or the newsgroup....

    From the prompt, type "fg" (no quotation marks) to put the stopped 
process, in this case Pine, back in the "foreground."  I actually use 
this feeature frequently and deliberately when I want to exit momentarily 
to perform some other task and then go back to Pine.  It is quite 
useful.  When Pine returns to the foreground, it repaints the screen.

Same question I posted around a week ago, with no response yet.  Perhaps
we will finally get an answer [even if the answer is wait for 3.92].

And if you've suspended more than one program, you can type `jobs'
get a list of the programs and their numbers and then type `fg %n'
to bring job n into the foreground, e.g., to bring job 2 into the
foreground, type:

	fg %2

Enjoy,

Hi all, 

I compiled too many time Pine, using cc, gcc, many flags but I'm not able
to delete messages from my folder. I use 'D' to mark, after 'X' to expunge
but when I close and reopen the incoming box, for instance, the messages 
still remain in the file..

I have also incompatiblity problem using both pine and elm, some messages
are visible by elm but not from pine, some time I got the message:
mailbox inalidated, consult an expert ?!?!

Perhaps is a platform problem ?
I'm tryiing a port in a non standard SVR4 platform, but it seems a 
configuration problem, in fact all the rest of the package works fine ...

Some hints ...
tnx a lot in advance
Francesco

Can anyone give me a site for a Solaris 2.4 binary?  My buddy tried building
the pine 3.91 source on Solaris 2.4 and was less than successful.  I'm
hoping that somebody has already worked out the kinks. :-)

I'm having the same problem when I log in as a regular user.  The message I
get is a little different - "Can't open folder lock - access is READONLY."
This message still appears even after a cold reboot.  I've checked the
/var/run directory - no pid files there.

Not seeing a FAQ file, I was wondering if anyone can help me..
I need to know how to send file attachments such as text files
or UUencoded files. When I sent test files, the other end said
it looked like garbage. Does this have something to do with using
MIME which I am also unfamiliar. Any help is appreciated.

I'm trying to use PC-Pine for the first time in a mostly Unix 
environment.  Our mail server is a Sun Sparc 10 running SMTP. I've been 
using a PC-based mail reader for some time now, without having an IMAPD 
running on the server.  

What is IMAP?  Can PINE run without IMAPD?  If not, where can I get 
IMAPD?

I am associated with several freenets in Missouri and they all use Pine.
Total population, about 27000 right now.
