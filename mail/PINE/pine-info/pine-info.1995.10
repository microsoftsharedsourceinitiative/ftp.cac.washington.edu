I'm running Pine 3.91 on SVR4, using NCSA Telnet on a Macintosh.

When I set my terminal to a large size (stty rows 50 columns 120) the
Pine composer starts acting funny. The screen will draw, then the screen
will shift up one whole line. Thus, when I compose, it looks like I'm typing
on the cc: line when I'm actually typing on the to: line. Needless to say,
this is quite frustrating. Any suggestions?

If you're talking about Yehavi's port of PINE to VAX/VMS, then
it's available by FTP from  vms.huji.ac.il, directory LOCAL
 
you'll need userid "ANONYMOUS"   (not "FTP").
 
If you're talking about vax/ultrix I can't help you.  If you're
talking about PMDF VMS PINE, it's a commercial product.

       This is fine provided all of your incoming mail is in your INBOX 
   (i.e., still in the mail spool).  However, I, like _many_ people, use a 
   utility such as procmail (or filter) to pre-sort mail into various 
   folders before I ever invoke my mail reader (Pine, in my case).  I have 
   been wanting a utility (Perl OK) that would list the headers of mail not 
   only remaining in the INBOX but also in pre-sorted folders.

   Paul

My personal prefernce is to use 'scan -file filename'.  scan is part
of the MH package.  I believe a crusty version comes w/ AIX, but
you're probably better off building the latest if you don't have it on
your system.  'frm' doesn't have enough flexibility for me, and it
only spits out the From and Subject fields.  I prefer to have more
info, so I alias 'frm' to this:

scan -form scan.spool -file $MAIL

My scan.spool:

%<(cur)+%| %>%<{replied}-%| %>\
%02(mon{date})/%02(mday{date}) \
%02(hour{date}):%02(min{date}) %3(tzone{date})\

  Just put all the addresses into the "Bcc:" line instead of the "To:"
line.
  To make the "Bcc:" line show up, press ^R when the cursor is in the
header of an e-mail being composed.

For others, the answer is that Pine 3.92 *will* (optionally) support
"just-send-8" for NNTP posting.

I believe Eric Allman looked into it during the alpha/beta test period
for sendmail 8.7, but found that it was a bit complicated and decided
not to delay the release further by implementation and testing of this
functionality. It may be included in a future version.

I don't know what version HP ships, but as far as 8.7.x (which can of
course be installed on HP-UX) is concerned:

If they announce their 8-bit capability through the 8BITMIME SMTP
extension (as sendmail 8.7 does), sendmail will not convert to Q-P. If
they don't, but are known to be 8-bit capable, you can tell sendmail not
to convert mail to them via the F=8 mailer flag (this should probably be
done per destination, e.g. using a mailertable or LOCAL_NET_CONFIG and
the 'smtp8' mailer). The first alternative is obviously more convenient.

It will have hooks for generic external sending and display filters.
It has been observed that this mechanism can be used for seemless
integration of facilities such as PGP, but it is also useful for things
like display filters for Japanese character sets.

The above is an excellent example of why "just send 8-bits" is
wrong-headed.  I normally read netnews either in a window that displays
ISO-8859-1 or ISO-2022-JP.  The above text is in BIG5, the encoding used
in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and if I display it in a BIG5 xterm it will
display properly.  In an ISO-8859-1 window the results are, um,
interesting.

However, since it was just sent as 8-bits, Pine hasn't the slightest idea
what character set it is.  I suspect that Pine will innocently apply
quoted-printable to this message (which isn't bad by itself) but will
probably label it as ISO-8859-1.  Oops.  Not its fault, though.

If the posting had been labeled as being MIME CHARSET CN-BIG5, Pine would
at least have had some warning.

No, it labelled it as US-ASCII, since I didn't have it configured for any
8bit character set.  US-ASCII with a bunch of undefined 8bit glyphs.
Well, I guess that's better than guessing at ISO-8859-1.

I have an old PC (XT clone) runing in a Non-windows DOS environment, I 
signed up with a non-profit server, Jeffnet and expected to be able to 
send files from work to home, then work on them at homein my own 
wordprocessor, convert them to ascii and send them back. I've been 
working for the Federal Government (US Forest SErvice in a Data General 
Environment) The documents arrive fine but I cannot make them come over 
to my PC. I have Procom. The people running the server are all windows 
based or Mac users and simply said they cannot help me. I'm a union steward 
and doing work for a lot of employees that need my help and are caught 
beneath the wheel of working for low wages for the Federal Government 
w/no benefits,(60% of The Forest Service employees are temporaries yet 
work the same job year after year with no benefits--all employees killed 
in last years Storm King debacle in Colorado were temporary employees). 
I'm in my off season right now and doing unpaid union work. I've been 
having to drive 100 miles round trip to transfer files from DG to disks 
to complete my work, when it ought to be easy and at my finger tips. As 
you might imagine, my management counter parts have been no help this 
problem. I guess I can take on Pine as an editing place, but the time 
involved online is problem in writing and editing long documents.
If anyone can help it would be very much appreciated.

In elm I can easily add headers as and when I need them (eg for a

I don't want to see the header in all outgoing mails, only when I send

use the Rich-HeaderSet...

Is there any way to do this in pine? Or is there a patch?

Yes, we plan to work on IMSP support as we convert Pine to support
IMAP4.  This will be after Pine 3.92+ is released and stable...

I have an account which is NFS exported from Machine 1 (a black NeXT) to 
Machine 2 (AIX 4.1).  The account is exported read-write and the uids and 
groupd match on both machines, so I have no problem manipulating files 
while logged into Machine 2.

Pine works from from Machine 1, but from Machine 2 it hangs while trying 
to open or write to any folder, including Fcc:.  I lists the folders 
fine, and will "open" empty folders, but anything that's not empty will 
cause it to hang.

After killing the pine process, I've noticed that it creates a 
folder.lock file on whatever folder was being opened.  The .pine-debug 
files show nothing unusual, just (when trying to open a folder called 
"jason"):

----
About to open folder "jason"  inbox: "INBOX"  
Close - saved inbox state: max 0 
end_signals(1) 

** Received SIGTERM **                   <--- when I killed the process

Any ideas?

First off, if you are on a Unix box for your service you can simply use 
the editor in Pine for receiving the (A)scii upload from Procomm for 
DOS.  You want Ascii and not Raw Ascii.  Your documents can be in a text 
form for the upload.  Get into a message, address it and put in the 
appropriate subject.  Once in the body editor, just upload (page-up) and 
select (A)scii.  Name the file and you will see an unholy wrath of ansi 
control sequences -- ignore them!  You can press <Ctrl>-<L> to refresh 
the screen after the upload has finished.  Hope this helps.  Downloading 
is not much different except you will want to do a screen capture 
(<Ctrl>-<F1> on mine) and name the capture file.  Then type out the mail 
file using the cat command.  I personally use sz and rz for sending and 
receiving zmodem file protocal.  I use this for downloading my mail 
file.  Hope this helps.

Congratulations.  You have an unsupported NFS configuration!

You see, beloved AIX expects NeXT to support a pair of daemons called
rpc.statd and rpc.lockd which attempt to implement system call level file
locking over NFS.  NeXT, being BSD, does not.

AIX, being a persistant little guy, assumes that NeXT may implement it
someday, and so it hangs, waiting for NeXT to implement it.  Who knows,
maybe NEXTSTEP 4.0 will be SVR4 and have those daemons, and then AIX will
unblock.

The lock files that you see are not part of the disease.  Rather, they
represent a different locking mechanism.  It worked just fine; it's the
other locking (one which prevents two copies of Pine from stepping on each
other) which faltered.

Assuming that you really want to access mail files over NFS on SVR4 (not a
good idea, actually; IMAP works much better), what you have to do is to
disable the flock() calls (which translate to fcntl() calls on SVR4).
Doing so blows away the protection against running two Pines on the same
mail file on the local system, but c'est la vie.

Unfortunately, this is a little bit hard to do on AIX, as opposed to other
forms of SVR4 (such as Solaris), because in Pine 3.91 flock() is emulated
by an AIX C library routine.  In Pine 3.92, flock() will be emulated by a
Pine-internal routine and there is an interface to disable locking.  You
could do this yourself by dropping in the imap-3.6.BETA version of the
IMAP toolkit in place of the imap-3.5 version distributed with Pine 3.91,
but you will need to do some C hacking to get it to build.

My recommendation is not to use NFS from AIX to the NeXT, but rather to
use IMAP.  This will avoid all the problems, and give you full locking.

Come on, give us a hint!  Is it weeks, month(s) or years to the next 
release?  Is it this year or ........   :-)

Well, sorry for being unpatient, but 3.92 seems very promising, with lots
of new features, and we are looking forward to update our 3.91 version,
soo please give us a little hope, tell us which month(s) to expect the new
release....  :-)

Great, but while I'm stuck with Pine 3.91, how to I get it to post
using 8-bit instead of QUOTED-UNREADABLE? And an option would be very nice
if you need to send letters to people that don't have MIME-support in
their mailer. I'd *very* much like to have the option of using

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8BIT

Btw, where can I find the patches for Pine 3.91 (QUOTED-UNREADABLE -> 8BIT)?

Thanks in advance. Please e-mail answers too.

If there is no variable for postscript files in .pinerc, you could instead
try to install a mailcap file (an example can be found in
{pine-root}/doc/mailcap.unxadd), and change the viewer entry to your preffered
viewer. (See pine documentation for possible locations of this file) For more
info on mailcap files, you can get the metamail package mm. mm is available via
ftp from directory pub/nsb at ftp.bellcore.com. The distribution is mirrored in
Europe in the directory mail/metamail on the machine src.doc.ic.ac.uk, and on
ftp.funet.fi in /pub/unix/mail/metamail.

  It can be done starting appropriate filters and changing the headers
from procmail (a simple example only for text/plain is in procmailex(1)).=

I use procmail as a delivery program, but it is not necessary.=20

Haa... So do I.

I am now thinking how to dig out space out of my 3Mb disk quota to store 
my own copy of Pine 3.92 before a system-wide upgrade is employed. :>

Hi all,

I would like to know if pine can locate my pre-set signature under the 
quoted message when I reply a mail? Since when I tried to reply and 
quote the old message, I found that my signature located in the top of my 
message, that's not normal, signature should always at the end of a 
message. Does anyone know the answer? 

Thanks alot! :>

At the To: field, press [Ctrl]+[R] -- which will bring up "Rich Header." 
Of those brought up, there's a Bcc -- Blind Carbon Copy, which is what 
you want -- just type all the names here.

Hm, I wrote an alias once, before I found out about the from command.
Here it is:
alias from	'more $MAILPATH | grep From | grep -v "<" | grep -v From: | cut -f2- -d" " ;echo ""; echo "Total Mail and current mailpath:" ; du -k $MAILPATH \!*'


Of course you have to have the environment variable MAILPATH set to whereever 
your mail is. It can easily be improved so it can show how many mails you got.

Thanks for the replies.  I'll try and modify the code as you suggested.  
How about adding a pine flag to select which behavior the user wants?  
You could default to "last to start", and make it a choice to have "first 
to start".  I know, I know, you'll add it to the list... :-)

On a related note, if I've left myself in pine at work, and then kill the 
pine process from another shell, will I hurt anything?  Other than a 
message I might be creating?

Thanks for your help!

Daniel

The problem with that is that you are pretty much stuck with making that
choice on a systemwide basis.  You can't just configure a single app for a
single user.  You also have to worry about things like IMAP.

No, it shouldn't hurt anything.

Ah, let me explain my scenario.  We have a userid on our system that is
shared between multiple people.  Any one of these people can log onto the
id and start pine.  The problem is that if one person is already in pine
another person can steal the folder lock.  Since it's a single userid,
there is only one .pinerc file and my scenario would work. 

We want whoever was in pine first to keep the inbox lock until they get 
out of it.  If there is ever a problem, a user can kill the running pine 
process.

Thanks, Daniel

Daniel,
Why don't you use Tenex format for the mailbox?  That avoids the locking
problem and even permits concurrent updates.

I'm going to have to plead ignorance here, how do I set this up on my 
machine?  I'm not familiar with Tenex format.  Any pointers will be useful.

It does sound like I want to do.

James, if you think you typed ^Z, just do a fg to bring the process back 
to the foreground.  If you have typed ^S, just type ^Q to resume output 
to the window.

If all else fails kill -9 <stopped-pine_process> and start a new 
instance.  After pine comes up you should be able to compose ("c") a new 
message and you will be prompted as to whether or not you want to 
continue with your "abandoned" mail.  Say yes ("y") and be where you want 
to be.

Anyway, I see from the message header that you posted this question 
several months ago.  Hopefully, this answer is redundant by now :).  
I just received your post today!

I think that the Pine Technical Notes have a section on it.

Basically, Tenex format is the format used by the "MM" program for many years.
It originated on the old Tenex operating system.  It has both the byte count
of the mailbox and pre-allocated flag space in out-of-band information (that
is, the internal header), so you can use random acces update-mode I/O to
manipulate mailboxes.  The only time you have to rewrite message data is when
doing an expunge, and even that is just blatting subsequent messages on top of
an expunge message.

There are two variants.  MTX format is actually closer to what the Tenex OS
really used, since it uses CR/LF newlines instead of Unix-style newlines.  MBX
is something new and experimental and not supported by Pine yet.  It has a 2K
binary header which contains additional mailbox particulars to fully support
IMAP4 protocol features.  There's a tool that converts between all of these
various formats.

The easiest way to use Tenex format is to create an empty file in your home
directory called mail.txt  The next time Pine is started, it will
automatically pull new mail from /usr/spool/mail into mail.txt and do the
format conversion as well.  All new mail delivered to /usr/spool/mail in the
future will also be snarf into mail.txt by Pine.

You may not want to do this if you intend to use some program other than Pine,
but if you're only using Pine you'll find that using Tenex format is usually a
performance win.  The main difference is that if you do a text search of all
messages in a big mailbox, it'll be slower with Tenex format.  This is because
Pine won't read the entire mailbox into memory with Tenex format.  On the
other hand, this can be a big win if Pine's memory use was a concern.

We have a network and we have uucp mail with mailx, why shoule Pine need
ent'?  If it is for the news

with out the network development?  Must be.
We have SCO unix 3.2.4 and will be upgrading imminently to Version 5.0.0

This is really minor, but sufficiently irritating that I'd love to see it 
changed in the next version. In a nutshell, I'd like to see the header 
section display the prompts in the order in which they are specified in 
the 'default-composer-hdrs=' line of .pinerc. For example, my conf is set 
to To:, CC:, Reply-To:, Attchmnt:, Subject: in that order but pine will 
always display the Reply-To: header first which continually trips me up 
when I'm sending mail that doesn't need it. I know I can specify that it 
only appear in the Rich Header mode, but I do use it enough that that is 
just as annoying. :) Anyway, I hope this changes in 3.92...

If there is some setting I'm overlook that already does this in 3.91, 
then I apologize and beg for some kind soul to tell me how to do this. 
:)

Status: O
X-Status: 

I have been trying the last week or two to switch to Pine from another
program which has become obsolete.  After having converted all my
aliases and distribution lists to the addressbook format, there are
still a few things bugging me.

1) Is it possible to define an alias which reads addresses in from
another file with a more flexible format--such as one address per
line, with the ability to comment out a line?  I would find it much
easier to manage my distribution lists by directly editing such a
file.  Further, I have one list which seems to be too long for Pine to
handle inside an addressbook--I gather this is a known problem, but
have not seen any workaround.

2) Pine does not allow a "nickname" (alias) with a '@' character.  Is
there any way around this restriction?  I actually use such aliases
with my old mail program to rewrite the addresses of a couple people
whose email comes with an incorrect return address--this way I can
just reply to their messages without having to manually change the
return address each time.

3) Is there any way to suppress Pine's attempts to incorporate the
"full name" field in an addressbook entry into the "To:" line of an
outgoing message?  I am interested especially in cases where the alias
is a distribution list or is an alias to another alias.  Editing the
addressbook by hand to remove the "full name" field helps in some
cases but seems a less than ideal solution regardless--it would be
nice to be able to use this field to organize the addressbook but not
have it affect the "To:" line.

Many thanks for any suggestions.

In Pine "Compose  Message", you can press ^R which  will show you something
like

=---8<--------------------------- cut here -------------------------->8---=

  PINE 3.91   COMPOSE MESSAGE                    Folder: INBOX  10 Messages

Attchmnt: 
Subject :

=---8<--------------------------- cut here -------------------------->8---=

All "Blind" recipients of your message have to go in the "Bcc:" field. They
will get your message, but will not appear in outgoing headers.

Liebe Gruesse, Nora.

We are going from one to the other, from a Vax which is not networked in 
our backbone, to AIX/Pine 3.9

I would be happy to have a batch file that would:

1. transform the mail files into pine readable format.
2. dump them into tape and transfer them.

Any ideas other than "extract" the mail messages and send them to yourself?

thanks,

 	We were about to implement PINE 3.91 as our mail user agent campus
 wide here.  We discovered that in the composition of an e-mail message 
 with the use of an attachment; the ^T To Files option would allow one 
 to journey thoughout our Unix system directories.  I have to deal with very
 novice users .... I cannot allow them to venture outside of their own personal 
 directories.  How do I accomplish this ???  We are on a DEC 5500 Mips based
 machine under Ultrix 4.3A OS.  I have been the Systems Admin since 1991 so
 I am really just a rookie myself in the Unix world.  Do I need to change 
 directory permissions ... or group assignments .... or compile PINE with
 certain .h file definitions "turned off" or what ?????????
 	Sorry if this is not considered a part of this e-mail list.... but I 
 did not know how to get assistence in solving this problem otherwise.  PINE is
 a very good product and we are excited about its productive use at our
 institution once this one issue is solved.  Thanks for your assistence !!!!!
 
 				Sincerely,
 				 Marshall Alexander

Just one of those curious questions - one of the lists to which I 
subscribe suffered a mail loop over the weekend, with multiple copies of 
the same message received over several hours.  The duplicates were not 
marked "N" in the inbox index.  I don't remember if the original message 
was still in the inbox after reading.

Just what does pine do to determine message status on received mail?
Could this have been set at the originating site?

Hello -

The index on ftp.cac.washington.edu shows a directory pine/docs/faqs (or
somesuch), in which are several files with various questionsand answers.
I looked in this directory, but it was empty.  I downloaded the faq.mbox
file in the pine/docs directory, but this did not have the question/answer
that I'm looking for.

I'm converting to Pine on Unix from VMSMail/PMDF Mail on Vax VMS.  Is there
a simple / convenient way to convert VMS distribution lists (.DIS files) to
an addressbook entry.  Several of my users have quite a few of these
distribution lists, and I surely do not wish to tell them that they have
to enter them again by hand.

Also, does Pine support a global addressbook, available to all users of
a machine, to maintain more general mailing lists?  I scanned the help
notes briefly, but did not find anything.

Please feel free to repost to the pmdf-info list, if that is appropriate.

Thanks for your help!

    From the Main Menu, go into Setup and Config.  Scroll down and turn 
on the signature-at-bottom indicator.

Past history has shown that if we estimate that we'll release by date X,
there is then zero chance that we'll make it by date X.  It doesn't matter
how pessimistic we are.  Really, this is true, ask anyone who has been
using Pine for a few years!  If we said, "surely by the end of the
year...," then you could count on it not being until January or February
at least.  So, you really don't want us to make an estimate, that would
just delay things.

Disclaimer:  The "surely by the end of the year..." example was not meant
to be a secret estimate :-), but *certainly* you can count on it being out
in less than a year from now.  Oops...

I am new to internet and I use PINE email software. The messages i 
receive are stored in the Service Provider's Hardisk.  Sometimes the 
messages are lengthy and take a long time for me to browse.  Is ther any 
way to download these EMAIL messages to my local P.C Hardisk.

A while back I asked for help concerning the DOS version of Pico.  It 
seemed that although it accessed files from other default directories as 
long as it was in the PATH, it would not writhe to the files when 
requested.  But in reading the man pages for the Unix version, I found 
the -t switch.  This enables writing to a file regardless of directory.  
There is only one drawback:  On exiting, I do not have the option not to 
save my work under the -t parameter.  The only way I can see getting 
around this is rebooting.  Does anyone know of a better solution?  Thanks.

  And if I save some messages from mail.txt to another folders, will they
be saved in tenex or Berkeley format? What about saving to a new folder?=20
And the last problem: Once I got a 50 MB long log mail and pine crashed on
it (cannot resize memory). I solved it with another tools (elm). Do you
think that it never happens with all mail in mail.txt for amounts less
then 100 MB (normally I have never had more then 11 MB, now I have 1.5
MB). Thanks for your answers.

I know that in Pine 3.91 you can sort the articles by OrderedSubj in the 
Setup/Config menu under the sort-key category.  See if that helps.

Is there a way to make Pine recognize the dated from Eudora's headers?
They appear as xxx -1 in the date field.  Upon looking into the headers 
of the message, the date is there but not exactly the same as Pine.

Thanks for any info....

I tried this just now under solaris 2.4. The mail was transfered ok to
what I assume is tenex format in $HOME/mail.txt, but on trying to exit
pine appeared to hang. After 5 minutes or so I killed the process and 
tried restarting. It hung again. I moved mail.txt to another filename in 
my main folder collection, expecting to have to edit it back at some 
stage to an ordinary mail file, but I find it loads happily into pine 
as part of a folder collection (although not of course into mail or 
mailx). So whats going wrong when it tries to use it as the inbox?

This is normal operation.  As you have not yet replied to the mail, the replied-to flag is not set.  If
you finish and post the postponed message, the flag will then be set.

What are the possibilities of adding the standard nntp authentication hooks

Yes, that's what I expected. Unfortunately it doesn't. Even after sending the emails none 
Flags were set. (I didn't quit pine nor suspended it, it was open all the time).

So the question is still active.

RFC 1521 Appendix B -- General Guidelines For Sending Email Data

Internet email is not a perfect, homogeneous system. Mail may become corrupted
at several stages in its travel to a final destination. Specifically, email
sent throughout the Internet may travel across many networking technologies.
Many networking and mail technologies do not support the full functionality
possible in the SMTP transport environment. Mail traversing these systems is
likely to be modified in such a way that it can be transported.

There exist many widely-deployed non-conformant MTAs in the Internet. These
MTAs, speaking the SMTP protocol, alter messages on the fly to take advantage
of the internal data structure of the hosts they are implemented on, or are
just plain broken.

The following guidelines may be useful to anyone devising a data format
(Content-Type) that will survive the widest range of networking technologies
and known broken MTAs unscathed. Note that anything encoded in the base64
encoding will satisfy these rules, but that some well-known mechanisms, notably
the UNIX uuencode facility, will not. Note also that anything encoded in the
Quoted-Printable encoding will survive most gateways intact, but possibly not
some gateways to systems that use the EBCDIC character set.

  1.  Under some circumstances the encoding used for data may change as part of
     normal gateway or user agent operation. In particular, conversion from
     base64 to quoted-printable and vice versa may be necessary. This may
     result in the confusion of CRLF sequences with line breaks in text bodies.
     As such, the persistence of CRLF as something other than a line break must
     not be relied on.

  2.  Many systems may elect to represent and store text data using local
     newline conventions. Local newline conventions may not match the RFC822
     CRLF convention -- systems are known that use plain CR, plain LF, CRLF, or
     counted records. The result is that isolated CR and LF characters are not
     well tolerated in general; they may be lost or converted to delimiters on
     some systems, and hence must not be relied on.

  3.  TAB (HT) characters may be misinterpreted or may be automatically
     converted to variable numbers of spaces. This is unavoidable in some
     environments, notably those not based on the ASCII character set. Such
     conversion is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, but it may occur, and mail formats
     must not rely on the persistence of TAB (HT) characters.

  4.  Lines longer than 76 characters may be wrapped or truncated in some
     environments. Line wrapping and line truncation are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED,
     but unavoidable in some cases. Applications which require long lines must
     somehow differentiate between soft and hard line breaks. (A simple way to
     do this is to use the quoted-printable encoding.)

  5.  Trailing "white space" characters (SPACE, TAB (HT)) on a line may be
     discarded by some transport agents, while other transport agents may pad
     lines with these characters so that all lines in a mail file are of equal
     length. The persistence of trailing white space, therefore, must not be
     relied on.

  6.  Many mail domains use variations on the ASCII character set, or use
     character sets such as EBCDIC which contain most but not all of the
     US-ASCII characters. The correct translation of characters not in the
     "invariant" set cannot be depended on across character converting
     gateways. For example, this situation is a problem when sending uuencoded
     information across BITNET, an EBCDIC system. Similar problems can occur
     without crossing a gateway, since many Internet hosts use character sets
     other than ASCII internally. The definition of Printable Strings in X.400
     adds further restrictions in certain special cases. In particular, the
     only characters that are known to be consistent across all gateways are
     the 73 characters that correspond to the upper and lower case letters A-Z
     and a-z, the 10 digits 0-9, and the following eleven special characters:

                     "'"  (ASCII code 39)
                     "("  (ASCII code 40)
                     ")"  (ASCII code 41)
                     "+"  (ASCII code 43)
                     ","  (ASCII code 44)
                     "-"  (ASCII code 45)
                     "."  (ASCII code 46)
                     "/"  (ASCII code 47)
                     ":"  (ASCII code 58)
                     "="  (ASCII code 61)
                     "?"  (ASCII code 63)


     A maximally portable mail representation, such as the base64 encoding,
     will confine itself to relatively short lines of text in which the only
     meaningful characters are taken from this set of 73 characters.

  7.  Some mail transport agents will corrupt data that includes certain
     literal strings. In particular, a period (".") alone on a line is known to
     be corrupted by some (incorrect) SMTP implementations, and a line that
     starts with the five characters "From " (the fifth character is a SPACE)
     are commonly corrupted as well. A careful composition agent can prevent
     these corruptions by encoding the data (e.g., in the quoted-printable
     encoding, "=46rom " in place of "From " at the start of a line, and "=2E"
     in place of "." alone on a line.

Please note that the above list is NOT a list of recommended practices for
MTAs. RFC 821 MTAs are prohibited from altering the character of white space or
wrapping long lines. These BAD and illegal practices are known to occur on
established networks, and implementations should be robust in dealing with the
bad effects they can cause.

Unfortunately, when you resume a composition, Pine is not able to tell
which message is being replied to.  We expect this to change at some

signature-at-bottom under Setup/Config menu will do that for

bottom for forwarded mail.  Anybody know how to do that?

It's possible, but first check the following:
	1) make sure that mail.txt is empty (0 bytes) and doesn't have
	   any spurious whitespace or newlines.
	2) make sure "inbox-path" in .pinerc is set to INBOX, and not

Is your home directory and/or /tmp NFS mounted?

mail.txt is accessed through random access update mode, which doesn't have
a prayer of working reliably via NFS.  Worse, on SVR4 (which Solaris is),
you have the infamous rpc.lockd and rpc.statd daemons to contend with.
I'm willing to be that that is what caused your hangs.

If NFS rears its ugly head anywhere in this picture, you're probably
better off not using tenex format.  You need a filesystem which implements

The simplest answer is that they should be saved in tenex format, although
it's actually rather more complex than that.  If you're worried about it
saving in multiple formats in the same folder, don't worry, it checks to
make sure that it doesn't do that.

The only way an out-of-memory crash can happen with tenex format is if a
single message is too large for available memory.  There isn't much that
it can do about that.

In Berkeley format, Pine reads the entire folder into memory, so a 50MB
Berkeley folder is likely to cause many (but not all) systems to choke.
The alternative to reading it all into memory is to use a scratch disk
file.  Here at UW, student users are likely to be at the limits of their
disk quotas on a regular basis; a memory image the size of their disk
quota isn't going to cause problems, but using double their disk quota for
a scratch file is.  Scylla and Charybdis.

Actually, a future version of Pine (not 3.92) will have the option of
using a scratch file for Berkeley format instead of reading it into
memory.  Besides chomping more disk, checkpointing and expunging will be
slower.  But it'll help out people with limited RAM.

Since no one else is picking up this subject I'll give it a go...

The problem Michael is describing here seems to be one many users of non-ANSI
based terminals run into. The reasons why Pine is not using termcap/terminfo
are described in the tech-info document. An excerpt:


          Arrow keys are  a  special  case.   Pine  has  the
          escape  sequences  for a number of conventions for
          arrow keys hard coded and does not use termcap  to
          discover  them.   This is because termcap is some-
          times incorrect, and because many users have  PC's
          running  terminal  emulators  that  don't  conform
          exactly to what they claim to emulate. Some  arrow
          keys  on old terminals send single control charac-
          ters like ^K (one even  sends  ^\).   These  arrow
          keys  will  not  work with Pine.  The most popular
          escape sequences for arrow keys are:


              Up:     <ESC>[A <ESC>?x <ESC>A  <ESC>OA
              Down:   <ESC>[B <ESC>?r <ESC>B  <ESC>OB
              Right:  <ESC>[C <ESC>?v <ESC>C  <ESC>OC
              Left:   <ESC>[D <ESC>?t <ESC>D  <ESC>OD

It is quite true that not all terminal entries in termcap/terminfo are
beauties and that some of them are incomplete. It is also true that some
terminals send unusual control characters that may "overlap" commonly used
CTRL key combinations. Therefore it seems to make sense to have Pine understand
only the most popular escape sequences and let the users program their
terminals to send these escape sequences.  However...

- Not many users know how to change escape sequences generated for the
  arrow/edit/function keys on their terminals.

- Changing the escape sequenses can seriously affect the proper operation
  of other termcap/terminfo based software. Yes, you can change the sequenses,
  invoke Pine and reset the keys with the old values after leaving Pine, but
  that is NOT user friendly. It's not even system administrator friendly.

- Limited support for "different" terminals is better that no support at all.


Therefore I would suggest to change Pine in such a way that the most popular
escape sequences (as shown above) continue to be recognized, but that termcap/
terminfo is being used wherever possible.

This way, people with the right (ANSI based) terminals but an incomplete
termcap/terminfo entry continue to be happy Pine users. The added bonus comes
from the fact that people with the "wrong" terminal that does have a right
termcap/terminfo entry can now also use Pine right out of the box!

I decided to change Pine to do exactly that, since that was the only way to get
all my employer's terminals to work with Pine. The terminals we have there
(MAI terminals) add a difficulty by having ^A as as the control code lead-in
character. This concept was not supported by the original Pine at all.

Since I think that more people may benefit from the changes I've made, I have
attached a patch file (diff -c) to this message (MIME encoded). The changes
included in this patch file are:


pine/ttyin.c :
- Added the kpinsert() function with the supporting static KBSTREE structure.
  Although based on the original function from Pico, kpinsert() was changed
  to prohibit intrusive changes to the escape sequence tree (overlap, hiding
  or value changing). The reasoning for this was to prevent the generic
  escape sequences (eg. VT100) that get defined AFTER the keys from termcap/
  info from ever changing any sequence defined BY termcap/info. Generic keys
  are great as a supplement to an incomplete termcap/info, but when defined,
  termcap/info should have precedence.

  An important change was the removing of the "cut the escape off the sequence"
  statement from kpinsert(). Although the name might indicate otherwise, escape
  sequences don't always start with an escape (the above mentioned MAI terminals
  for example, use CTRL-A to start their key sequences). All sequences are now
  being stored in the tree without change.

- The function read_char() was rewritten to use KBSTREE instead of the fixed
  sequences, but the functionality of the unparsed function-keys eater remained
  in (that the "ESC ESC -> CTRL" mapping also remained in goes without saying).

  A look-back buffer was created to store an escape sequence being compared
  with KBSTREE. If the match now fails at any point, the function-key eater
  can still recognize the beginning of a sequence and pick up the pieces.

  Every character read is compared with the KBSTREE (no single META character
  testing). Since the top of the tree is usually very small (normally 1 entry,
  2 entries when using MAI like terminals) and the code pretty lean this should
  not result in performance problems.

- The function setup_keystrokes() was added to hang the terminal specific and
  generic keystroke sequences into our KBSTREE. If NO_DEFAULT_KEYS is defined,
  the generic keys will not be added (I've used it for debugging).


pine/status.c :
- Added a simple (c < 256) check before calling isalpha(). At least on Linux,
  isalpha() breaks if the input character is outside the 0-255 range.
  (it uses the character as an index into a 256 entry array!)

 
pine/strings.c :
- Added the KEYs PGUP, PGDN, HOME, END, DEL and, quite important, INVALID to
  the list in pretty_command(). This truly helps debugging code and replaces
  'Command "4" not defined for this screen' with the better understandable 
  'Command "INVALID KEY" not defined for this screen'.


pico/os_unix.c :
- Changed GetKey() to match the new read_char() function of pine/ttyin.c.
- Added ReadWithTimeout() as a support function for GetKey().
- Removed the now obsolete function kbseq().


pico/os_vms.c :
- Did the same type of changes that were done to pico/os_unix.c, including
  adding a somewhat silly ReadWithTimeout().

  Note: I don't have VMS at hand. I can only verify that the code compiles
        correctly and that the changes seem to make sense. Could some kind
        soul please verify that this actually works?
  

pico/tcap.c :
- Added support for termcap DELete and Function keys.
- Changed kpinsert() to match the same function now in pine/ttyin.c.
- Added "\033" to all generic sequences, since kpinsert() no longer cuts off
  the leading escape.
- Replaced many of the "external" references to "static" (as in pico/tinfo.c).


pico/tinfo.c :    
- Added support for terminfo DELete and Function keys.
- Changed kpinsert() to match the same function now in pine/ttyin.c.
- Added "\033" to all generic sequences, since kpinsert() no longer cuts off
  the leading escape.


NOTE: Although I thought of having just one universal KBSTREE in libpico.a,
      I decided against it (at least for the time being). For this to work well,
      both Pine and Pico need to have unified function key values. At present,
      that looked like pushing it ;-)


The changed Pine and Pico have been used on a fairly wide range of terminals
(ANSI-based and non ANSI-based) ever since last March. No major problems have
been reported so far (none that I could trace back to my changes anyway :-).

People with terminals having arrow keys that send a single control characters
(e.g. Wyse and friends), should be aware that these control character will
most likely overlap certain control key functions of Pine and Pico.
Since the highest priority is given to the termcap/terminfo matching,
attempting to use such functions will result in cursor movement instead.
Should you be noticing this, know that you can ALWAYS use the following 
workaround to access any Pine or Pico function (overlapped or not):

  Instead of keeping CTRL pressed while selecting the key for your function,
  FIRST press ESC twice and THEN type the key without pressing CTRL.

Even though the developers never intended the "2x ESC = CTRL" trick to be
a workaround for this, it works absolutely great (As a matter of fact, it
comes in quite handy when you're holding the phone with one hand!).

If you use some script to program ANSI sequences into your arrow keys, but you
still use the original termcap/terminfo entry, the changed Pine will recognize
the ANSI keys (because their recognition continues to be hard coded in Pine).
However, pressing a CTRL key combination that is defined in termcap/terminfo
as an arrow/edit/function key will now result in cursor movement instead of
the activation of the expected Pico/Pine function.

For Wyse 60 terminals this problem can be avoided if your UNIX distributor
provided you with the ANSI-key ("ak") termcap/terminfo entries. By selecting
"wy60ak" instead of "wy60", the arrow keys are programmed with ANSI escape
sequences upon terminal initialization and will also be recognized as such.
(Yes, that also means it would have worked with the original Pine). 

Should any of these changes ever make it into the Pine distribution, it may
be wise to optionally deactivate the termcap/terminfo recognition using a
configurable parameter.

One final notice: if the DEL is defined in the termcap/terminfo entry for your
terminal, it will now do a delete instead of a backspace. This is a feature,
not a bug ;-)


I would welcome any questions or remarks!

P.S.   To the people of the Pine development team: this patch is not exactly
       the same as the one I've sent you last March. The "& 0x7f" masks that
       Pico's input handler wrongfully inherited from Pine in that patch have
       been removed. Their disadvantage wasn't noticed until I needed to enter
       some special ISO-8859-1 characters.

Oops...

I forgot to mention that the patch included in the previous message
is intended to be applied to a "clean" Pine 3.91 (perhaps with the
"global option" bug-fix applied).

After decompressing keys.diff, run "patch < keys.diff" in the directory 
that has "pine3.91" as a subdirectory.

What is MailConverter 2.0 and where did you find it?

This modification will require less hacking than you might think- gzip will
handle multiple gzip'd files concatenate together.

This is not necessary. Simply specify gzip as the standard and link the
modified ELM against the gzip library. Then the files can be uncompressed into
memory, and saved messages (or the output of filter) can be simply concatenated
to the end of existing folders, as documented by the gunzip man page:

This means that the uncompressed form of the folder need never be stored
on the drive, and that appending messages to a folder will NOT require
recompressing the entire folder, unless you want optimal compression.

Some rudimentary folder locking will be necessary to prevent having one
or two messages corrupted if(when) two processes attempt to write to the
same file.

Well, this looks at *all* lines which contain "From".
It should be "^From: ", though.
And even this does not skip "included non-quoted mails".

So - could somebody give a better script?  PERL, anyone?
I'd promise the best script a postcard from Berlin.
How about one of the "wrapped Reichstag"?

I intend to add these scripts the "ELM Pages" (see sig)
so that I can point people to it when the question arises yet again.

Which parts of headers do you want? Here is a Perl replacement for 'from'
that I use, and I could certainly customize it for anything you want, or
super-condense it and add support for the Apparently-From: header. Use
'from -h' to get usage; it runs under both Perl 4 and Perl 5. It even
re-canonicalizes addresses to the standard "Name <address>" format, no
matter what format it's currently in.

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -s
# from - Find out who incoming mail is from, with support for mailfiles

sub usage {
  print "'from' displays incoming mail From-addresses, with or without subject,\n";
  print "\toptionally from '~/mbox' or a file.\n";
  print "Usage: from [-s] [-f [mailbox|file]]\n";
  exit;
}
&usage if $h || $help;

sub printhead {
  if ($from) {
    print "From: $from @date\n";
    if ($s) {
      print " Sub: $subject\n" if $subject;
      undef $subject, $subjflag;
    }
    undef $fromflag, $from;
  }
}

if ($f) {
  $file = shift(@ARGV) || "$ENV{'HOME'}/mbox";
  if (! -r $file) {
    print STDERR "Can't open $file\n";
    exit 5;
  }
  open(I,"$file");
} else {
  &usage if $#ARGV >= 0;
  open(I,"$ENV{'MAIL'}");
}
while (<I>) {
  if (/^From /) {
    chop ($i = $_);
    &printhead;
    ($x,$from,@date) = split(/[ \t]+/,$i);
  } elsif (/^From: / && !$fromflag) {
    chop;
    s/^From: //;

There's no reason for folders to be in AFS unless the user puts them there.
(The user can define folder locations in the client, as with pine's 
folder collections definitions in the .pinerc.) You can configure the IMAP 
server so that folders and inboxes alike are located on local filesystems.  
How to do that depends on which imapd you are running.

If you use the Cyrus imapd, your users should not be logging in to the IMAP
server, and your users' login sessions on other machines should have no 
effect on authentication of the imapd processes.  A fortiori, the Cyrus 
imapd handles all folders on local disk.  Trying to wedge that into AFS 
would be a supremely bad idea.

That's right, but it shouldn't enter into your IMAP server configuration 
at all.

If you need some boilerplate code to serve as an example of how a process 
can get a Kerberos ticket and an AFS token, let me know and I'll be glad to 
send you a sample or two.  Getting such code to build is highly dependent 
on your particular platform, Kerberos libraries, and AFS version.

For information on mkpgp, use the following command:

	finger slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu

To get a copy of mkpgp, send a blank email message to:

	slutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu

with:

It is written in csh, though (a Unix shell language), so it will
definitely not run on a PC for PC-Pine.

    It depends on what operating system your computer is using.  *IF* it
is Unix or one of the sort-of-Unix-workalikes, go into your home directory
and create a file specifically by the name of .signature (note the leading
period -- this is required).  In the Pine configuration (if you are using
Pine 3.91 you can use the config screens) make sure that signature-file is
set to .signature, either explicitly or by default.  For other systems
(such as with PC-Pine), you'll have to check the documentation for the 
name and location of the sig file.

Not to make any hasty statements about the technology of e-mail programs 
nowadays, but I see GREAT limitations in these programs to support 
ORGANIZING e-mail!  Great, your program can do all these nifty things to 
help u in your PRESENT e-mail experience, but what about the FUTURE?  
And what about those pack-rat librarian types that like saving their 
e-mail debates for the long-term?  Someone goes back to their folders that 
contain hundreds of messages....downloads them...tries to organize them 
on their pc, & virtually starts going gray b4 they finish sorting thru 
ONE FOLDER.  So what am I saying? And what specific improvements would I 
suggest?
    Firstly, give the option to save by SUBJECT as the default. 
This keeps all the mailers in a debate on the same subject in the same 
folder.  Sure, there's prolly a program that can do that now...but I 
don't think Pine can yet.  What else?  Secondly, have the program 
AUTOMATICALLY insert the first letter of the person your debating w/ in 
front of the 'replied' text...& also have it insert an abbreviated version 
of the date in front of the text to organize those two year long debates 
that seem to have been going on for ages.(c below). Finally, have the mail 
program be able to AUTOMATICALLY save messages to more than one folder at 
once....& automatically make copies of your incoming messages & save them 
in different folders for u.  Example:  Today I receive 10 messages from 5 
different people w/ 8 different debating topics.  First, when I receive 
this mail, the program should have AUTOMATICALLY made a copy of each 
message and saved it in an "inbox history" folder for u (This folder will 
keep a perfect record of all the mail u have received)[Idealy, the mail 
program should keep these stats for u, as opposed to having to actually 
'copy' the message to a folder]. Second, ideally, the e-mail program 
should have the function to RECOGNIZE the subject header and attempt to 
save a copy of that message in the subject folder that matches that 
subject header.... This way u will have all the messages automatically 
filtered into folders by the subject line---organization begins to get 
easier now.  Third, any REPLIES that u receive to messages should be 
taken off an 'outstanding thread' list that the e-mail program has in it's 
memory.  U should be able to ask your program which mailers I have & 
haven't received replies to... this will give the e-mailer the 
opportunity to reminds the recipient to comment on an important mailer 
that they mailed out 2 weeks ago w/ those 20 other ones....this prevents 
the 'important mailer' that gets lost in the shuffle of things.

How would I increase the power of outgoing part of programs?  Again, have 
pine AUTOMATICALLY, not only save your message to a sent-mail folder (or 
stats list), but if saves a copy to the particular subject it is 
addressing in the subject header.  Also, again, the program should be 
able to keep track of which messages are going out, so it can keep track 
of your 'outstanding' messages.
------
E-mail format should look like the following.....


D>10225. Hey Bryan, What did u think of the Oj Verdict?
B>10245. Dave, I think  Oj was guilty cuz.....blah blah blah blah.....
 >Blah blah blah................
 >Blah blah bla...........
 >Blah Blah........
D>10265. Bryan, Bryan, Bryan,.....He was innocent cuz....blah blah blah
 >Blah blah blah......
B>10275. No. Guilty Dave......Blah blah blah......
 >Blah  Blah......
-------

Anything an e-mail program can do to support the maintenance of the above 
'clean' & organized format should be done.  Too many ">'s" kill a lengthy
debate.  Inserting the first letter of your name and indenting all the
following text 1 space GREATLY adds clarity.  Inserting a BRIEF date in
front of the your response adds chronology to long running debates.
These are my suggestions.  If I had programming knowledge, I would create
and e-mail program to do everthing I mentioned in this mailer (if 
possible).  Maybe it's just for the librarian, pack-rat, record-keepers, 
but I have a feeling that this format will become the e-mail format of 
the future due to it's increased clarity and organization friendliness.

PS. I know u said u didn't want any questions, but here's the question I had
that spurred my suggestions above.... Maybe  u can try to answer this 
question in xchange for my unsolicited opinion above......Thanks...:)

------------
I'm assuming this is a rather unique question that hasn't been addressed on
this list before...  I'm not a regular subscriber, so I wouldn't be able
to know for sure.  I scanned thru Uwash's web site, and didn't seem to find
the answer.  I also tried connecting to the pinedemo in hopes that it would
'run' the way I wanted it to 'run,' but it apparently seems to be 'down'
right now.
Anyway, My question:  After downloading a folder of mail, if I REupload it,
include it in a mailer, and send it to myself, will pine break this folder
up into individual messages again, or will I only receive one big message?
Well, the answer seems to be vary.... Why?  Cuz I have had BOTH situations
happen.  Last year at Auburn U, I sent an entire folder and pine successfully
broke it back up into it's separate messages for me.  But NOW, I'm using 
FSU's freenet, and it apparently wants to insert a ">" at the beginning 
of EVERY header forcing pine to see this folder as ONE BIG file, as opposed
to a bunch of little messages that are coming in.  Anyway, my question is
how I get pine to do what it did at Auburn....breaking up the folder...
treating each message separately.?  Is this a pine decision, or system
decision?

Why do I want to know?  Well, last year I downloaded all my folders, but I
forgot to organize them b4 I downloaded them.  Now I want to upload them
back to the system, read them in a file, send them to myself, and have 
pine rerecognize them as separate mailers. This will give me a chance to 
rearrange them at my leisure & put them in the correct order b4 I 
download them once again..... C the problem?

I don't know if "wedge" is the proper word.  This is unfortunately a
drop-dead issue if I can't get IMAPd to work with AFS, though, and if they
won't work together then I need to know so that I can cancel this project
and rework (we're supposed to sign the contract tomorrow!). 

The reason this is a drop-dead issue is that this system is primarily (as
far as the chancellorial-level management cares, exclusively) for email. 
Users get an X-megabyte quota for their use of *everything*. 

Trying to segregate users' diskspace into two pieces (mail folder space 
for mail use, home directory for other use) presents two problems which 
are politically unsolvable.

First, how to break down the ten megabyte quota into mail use and other
use?  From the upper management, the answer would be clear: ten megabytes
for mail use and zero for other use.  That's not very practical, but
enough people use our machine that way (*never* logging in and *always*
using IMAP clients) to where it would make sense for some users.  For some
of our web-publishing users, the answer would be one megabytes mail and
nine megabytes other, or ten megabytes other and none for mail. 

Second, no matter how you break it down, what's the point of going to AFS
in the first place if the majority of user disk usage is going to have to
remain in UFS?  We're hitting NFS scalability problems big time right now,
and our environment won't let us go to multiple IMAP servers until
IMAP4/IMSP redirection support is there; we need to put mail folders in
the user home directories to maintain the transparency that our users 
take for granted.

Hi!

This question probably has been up several times, but I just added this 
group today. 

Are there any ways to get Pine to encrypt a message using PGP? I'm 
running Pine on a Ultrix system (DEC), and I'd like to hear about any 
solutions that might be (a sort of shell, a new version of Pine etc.). 

Thanks in advance!

Hi FOlks,

	Just upgraded to 3.91 from 3.89 and most of the updates seem 
really quite nice.  However I have a problem in that whenever I use the 
Reply command, pine crashes.  It dumps core with an Abort signal and 
creates a ~/.pine-crash file.  

	This occurs after it asks me whether the messge text should be
included in the reply and whether it should reply to all reciptients. 
Looking at the core dump with dbx, it appears in the 'ArrangeHeader'
function in the builtin pico. 

	I can compose new messages without problems and the stand-alone 
pico executable seems to work just great.  I'd really appreciate any 
advice anyone might have before I start digging into this.  I don't mind 
getting my hands dirty, but if someone else has run into this, I'd love 
to hear about it.

	Thanks!

I noticed that you are using DGUX version.  Someone else had that problem 
as well from what I recall.

Feel free to consult my own notes on installing Yehavi's port
of PINE for VMS at my lab:

I would if you would.  Oh well, alright, Yehavi's designation
is 3.91 beta 5.

there are two ways to get a signature in your mails:

	Make a file with an editor and read while writing the mail this 
	file into your mail (Command: R, when the Cursor is in the body 
	of the mail).

	Make a file with the name ".signature" (or take another name and 
	add this name in the config screen) and the file will 
	automatically intefgrated in your mails. Note: You can 
	automatically put the signature at the bottom of the mails by 
	using the "signature-at-bottom"-feature in your config screen.

Hope it helps

	Ralf

 I was wondering if anyone knew how to set up pine to spawn
 ghostview to read a postscript attachment.  It should work
 the same way it does when the attachemnt is a gif or tiff file
 and it spawns the image-viewer defined in .pinerc but there is
 not a variable in .pinerc for postscript files.

 thanks in advance,

Hi,

	When one of our user using the modem, and connect to our server and using
	pine(using pico as an editor)  to send a email. The connection is cut 
	while he writing  the message.

	At the previous time, he can retrieve the interuupted mail, and continue to
	compose it. However, this time he couldn't retreive the mail. And he want
	to know how he can retrieve back his mail. He has typed this mail for 2 hrs.
	He also want to know why. This part is what we can't explain and need your help.

	The user is in urgent need and would you mind treating this as top prority?
	And he also want to know how to prevent the future occurrence.

Lately I've gotten the error "Message to save shrank!  (#3: 14059 --> 14058)"
for several messages I've tried to save from the inbox to another folder.
I've never seen it before, and gotten it several times this week since I 
switched to Tenex format for the mailbox.  (mail.txt in home dir).

My only option is to delete the note.  What's going on?

Thanks, Daniel

I've hacked imapd (V3.5) to allow this. The source compiles on AIX 3.x.
(And should compile on most system with an ANSI C compiler.)
It is a "proof of concept" hack. I don't know anything about
Performance and scalability in a 26,000 user environment.
It is not in general use in our 2,000 user environment!

The source is in /afs/uni-hohenheim.de/sw/src/imap-3.5.afs.hoh/src/imap-3.5
Binaries for RS/6000 are in

    I posted the following on my service provider's in-house newsgroup.  
Some suggested the 'stty rows 43' command, but Pine hiccupped a little on 
that.  It would would scroll the top line off the screen, the bottom line 
(of commands) did not show, and on some screens the (resulting) top line 
was duplicated.  Have any other Unix Pine users had experience with 
this?  I should have made it clear in my original posting that my purpose 
was to use a 43-line mode with Pine.

Thanks.

Yes, but by that logic, giving is a finishing date of (none) means that 
pine 3.92 will be finished some time after that! (This would go a bit of 
a ways towards explaining the long delay. :-) Anyway, at least on a 
psychological basis, deadlines are a good way of bringing a project to 
some semblance of completion.

This is a known bug in Pine 3.91 on UNIX.  It can be caused by carriage
return (\015) or null (\0) characters in the message.  Ain't supposed to
happen, it said here, but it does.

The carriage return problem is fixed with Pine 3.92.  The null problem
will be fixed when Pine upgrades to the imap-4 toolkit (hopefully the next
version after 3.92).

This also occurs in PC Pine, but for a different reason.  This too is
fixed in 3.92.

I was just playing around with MOSS, and noticed that Pine
doesn't like it if you define new multipart MIME content-types
in the mailcap

It would be nice if a future version of Pine let you (a) 
specify how multipart types are to be handled in the mailcap,
and (b) supported the "compose" and "composetyped" mailcap
feature.  If nothing else, this would be a great way to support
cryptography without falling foul of ITAR, but that's another
newsgroup... ;-)

Just wondering if this was on the feature list!

It seems the only way I can get around this is to extract the raw text and 
decode it using a PC program which can read PINE attached files. Does anyone 
know if there is such a file? (Preferably for the PC, of course...)

Please respond quickly, it's sending me round the bend...

(a) Best solution:
Make yourself a user 'champion' and login and use that user.  This will 
prevent accidentally issuing a 'rm *' in '/' deleting everything.  root 
should be reserved for use only when you need system administrator priv's 
not for general use.  Under this solution, your e-mail will go out as being 
from 'champion' and you'll be set.  Not only will it solve your Pine 
problem, but it will increase the security and safety of your system.

(b) Bad solution:
If you really HAVE to (not want to) work as root, get the source for 
Pine 3.91 and modify the pine/osdep/os-lnx.h file.  You need to uncomment 
out the '#define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM' option.  Compile that ('build lnx'),
then add the 'From: <champion@airmail.net>' to the custom headers section 
of your .pinerc.

I may be missing the point on the scripts, but /usr/ucb/from works for me.

the local mail spool is /var/mail

works just fine.
if the files aren't in $HOME, then put the correct path....

IMAP certainly lets you do this... but Pine at the moment does not.
In 3.92 you'll be able to add /user= to a remote folder specification;
this should do it for you.

Apologies to anyone who thinks this doesn't belong here, but I
know of no better place! (suggestions?)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

For my final year project, I am developing an X-based
mail-reader which will run under Solaris.  Hence, I am interested
in people's perceptions of their current mail-reader and 
interested in what features people think are important in a 
mail reader, since, obviously, I only use a distinct subset of
my mailer's capabilities. 

Some of the features which I would like to support are:

- - aliases
- - piping
- - ability to PGP sign and PGP encrypt messages
- - multiple folders, including sent folder, received folders, etc
- - use of an external editor (e.g. vi or emacs)
- - ability to re-send mail (``forward'' and ``bounce'')
- - ability to view a subset of the mail folder (e.g. by subject or 
  address)
- - configuration options (e.g. attribution strings, automatic
  inclusion of signature, etc.)
- - Attachments/MIME support (though this may require the use
  of an internal rather than an external editor...)

What does anyone else want?  For example, which options would people
most like to configure?

It would be most helpful if you could rate each of the above on
a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 meaning ``I definately would like
this option'' and 1 meaning ``I definately do not want this
option'').  It would also be useful if you could list which
features you would most like to be able to configure.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE NOTE:  I need to assume that any replies to this questionnaire
may be used by me in any manner deemed necessary in this project.  
In particular, I may incorporate some replies into my reports and 
incorporate ideas into my final program.  However, please be assured
that, where appropriate, messages will be attributed to their source 
(including e-mail address).

For a number of reasons, I moved 50 or so messages from my inbox to "saved
messages" in Pine.

Now, I would like to move them back to the inbox and download them via a
POP client.

However, when ever I use the "save" command, I am prompted for a folder
name, I duly enter "INBOX" and it tells me the folder does not exist, and
would I like to create it. The "list folder" function idicates the inbox
is indeed in existance, and the ^T (to folders) function in the save
dialogue indicates the same thing.

In fact, this protocol would be a good thing to learn so that I can also
download my sent messages.

So, in bottom line terms - help?!?

TIA

I use popmail which can be gotten from:

ftp://ftp.cic.net/pub/Software/unix/mail/popmail.shar.gz

I will try to help if you have any questions about it.

Ouch! Bad protocol to answer one's own post, but I gotta share my
work-around, or solution (I am not sure which):

I ftp'ed the two files, "saved messages" and "sent mail" from the
mainframe (Alcor). Then, I used MailConverter 2.0 to translate the files
into Eudora readable folders, then dropped them into the Eudora folder in
the system.

It worked seemlessly. :-)

I would till be curious as to how to manipulate such things in Pine, just
not so desperately so!

HI,

I just wanted to ask if Pine 3.92 will include a configurable attribution 
line - the one which says "ON xxx so-and-so wrote:" at the top of reply mail.

I'd very much like to be able to change this to something like "Dear X", for 
example, without having to recompile.

Thanks,

Peter

Subject: Spreading IMAP loading on one mailhub...

Message-Id: <46qg87$2g9@leofric.coventry.ac.uk>

Hi,
	I've got a Sun Sparc 20 (160 MB ram, Sol 2.4) which is acting as a 
	primary mailhub. We provide mail access to the whole site via IMAP 
	and run sendmail 8.6.12 on the hub for mail....

	My problem is I really need to spread the load of my IMAP users as
	they can eat a fair bit of memory between them (when I get more than 
	about 125-130 the machine loading really starts to climb). I could
	throw more memory and CPU at it, but as I've got a couple of other
	less powerful but underused Sun SS10's I'd like them to help. Ideally,
	I'd NFS mount the mailspool accross to the other two suns....

	The problem as always is file locking. If my 8.6.12 sendmail is writing
	to a user mailbox as an IMAPD on another host is doing something, the
	mailbox is gonna get trashed. So, can anyone suggest a more elegant
	solution or a RELIABLE method of file locking? I really don't want
	to start splitting our domain internally into two internal subdomains
	which are then munged into one for outgoing mail, but at the moment 
	this is the only sensible method I can see...

	any suggestions appreciated.

	Otherwise, is there anyway to make my IMAP processes more machine 
	friendly? 

	cheers.

Joseph,
The odds are *very* high that Pine is not mangling anything,
but that your *sendmail* is configured to rewrite addresses in ways it
shouldn't.

As a test, set smtp-server= to someplace in a different subdomain
(in hopes of bypassing the local sendmails)...

Even so, your last example is indeed bizarre... the "sdchemw1" should have
been suppressed.  What does your /etc/hosts entry look like for that host?

hello everyone,

This is not a bug query but I have a question on how
to save all the files in any particular pine folder
onto a floppy;
is this do-able by folder or must each file be
moved into another area separately, assembled into a folder
there and >then< dumped on a floppy ?

Many Thanks,
Karl

I am using the filter program to sort incoming messages to separate folders. 
I set up an incoming message folder called foo, and tell filter to direct 
certain messages to foo.  When a message comes in and is directed to foo, 
Pine creates a NON-incoming message folder called  foo.  The message will
appear in the non-incoming folder called foo, but the incoming folder 
called foo is still empty.

Any ideas about what's going on would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Sorry, you cannot setup sig-at-bottom in pine for forwarding mail..hopefully 
the next version will "fix" this.

Jim,
The relevant info from your .pinerc is the incoming-folders and
folder-collections definitions.  Given the contents of those two
variables, we might be able to help...

Huh??  Pine (pico) has a built-in spell checker.  While in compose mode, 
press ^T (control+t).  It only picks up obvious errors, not anything near 
as good as WordPerfect would, for example, and it does NOT suggest 
corrections, but it's better than nothing.  By the way, I just ran a 
spell check on this message, and it told me that the following words are 
invalid, so you can see it's kind of lame: Newsgroups, WordPerfect, pico, 
comp.mail.pine, daviesc.   Hope this helps.

I accidentally added an incoming folder with the 'Add' command.  When 
I try to delete it and type y to confirm, it says:

	Can't delete folder so-and-so.  No such folder.

How do I get rid of the name of the folder if the folder isn't there.  
(I feel like I'm in windows 95).

This is unimportant and therefore incredibly irritating.  Thanks for any
help you can offer.   .

It's all in the (S)etup -> (C)onfig Screen, something like use-alternative-editor.

There is even a Flag to always use the alternative editor.

(Once you are in config try "?" on those fields, it's full of help!)

Hi,

Wondering if anyone knows where I can find the description
of the Mail files (/usr/spool/mail) format? Is it a RFC822 format?

I am curious to find out how PINE marks the each 
mail as read,new, and addressed? I opened the mail file
with an hex editor and didn't manage to see any difference
between a read and new mail.

Thanks

Way

Wingra Technologies of Madison, Wisconsin is getting ready to release 
a version of their Missive e-mail switch for the AIX operating system.
We are seeking beta test sites to work with us in testing this new product. 
     
Missive/AIX is an RS/6000 based, software-only intelligent messaging 
hub that integrates multiple e-mail systems into one e-mail network 
with a global X.500 e-mail directory.  Support is currently provided 
for: 
     -- SMTP/MIME mailers like Sendmail, ZMail, and Internet mail
     -- cc:Mail
     -- Microsoft Mail
     -- MHS and gMHS mailers like DaVinci and Beyond
     -- DEC All-In-1
     -- DEC VMSMail
Future versions of Missive/AIX will provide support for 
Profs/OfficeVision VM, Lotus Notes, and X.400.
     
Missive/AIX has a quick config feature so it can be up and running in 
quick order.  Missive's X-Windows based management utility provides a 
graphical representation of the e-mail network and color-coded alerts 
to make managing the network a breeze.
     
The X.500 global e-mail directory is pre-configured and easy to 
populate.  Users can query the directory via their web browser (an 
industry first) or through email.  In fact, Missive/AIX contains a 
World Wide Web server and makes extensive use of web technology to 
provide help information, updates, and technical support.
     
If you would like to become a beta test site for Missive/AIX or would 
just like additional product information, please call me at 
1-800-544-5465 or check us out on the web at http://www.wingra.com/
We'll also be at E-mail world in Boston on November 28-30, 1995.
    
Thanks,
Dave

Subject: PINE mangles domain names!
Date: 27 Oct 1995 23:55:21 GMT
Message-Id: <46rrh9$mp9@news1.ucsd.edu>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

X-Status: 

Hello all,

This is a fairly involved problem, but the net result is that PINE has 
become useless for sending mail on our system because it takes liberties 
with both the domain names of the sender as well as local (same host) 
recipients.   I hope some of you may be able to shed some light on this; 
it's bewildered me and our sysadmin and if it doesn't get resolved soon, 
I'll be forced to use ELM!!!!

Okay, I'm joluk@sdchemw1.ucsd.edu.  Our domain is ucsd.edu.  The 
user-domain variable is set to its default (no value).

Problem 1: I want to send mail to local user dpb@sdchemw1.ucsd.edu.  So 
I type "dpb" in the To: field, and PINE resolves it to "Doug Book 
<dpb@sdchemw1.ucsd.edu>".  Okay so far.  But when Doug receives the 
message, its header reads:
		From: Joseph Luk <joluk@ucsd.edu>
		To: Doug Book <dpb@ucsd.edu>

This is *NOT* what I see in the editor screen just before sending the 
message!  In fact, there is no user dpb@ucsd.edu.  It somehow got 
delivered but the wrong addresses are shown to the receiver.  What the 
heck is going on here?

It gets more bizarre, too.  Experimenting with the user-domain and 
use-only-domain name settings reveals the following:

user-domain = sdchemw1.ucsd.edu
	(on screen) To: Doug Book <dpb@sdchemw1.ucsd.edu>
	(received mail header)
		From: Joseph Luk <joluk@ucsd.edu>
		To: Doug Book <dpb@ucsd.edu>

user-domain = sdchemw1
	(on screen) To: Doug Book <dpb@sdchemw1>
	(received mail header)
		From: Joseph Luk <joluk@ucsd.edu>
		X-Sender: joluk@sdchemw1.ucsd.edu
		To: Doug Book <dpb@ucsd.edu>

user-domain = <no value set>
use-only-domain-name = Yes
	(on screen) To: dpb@sdchemw1.ucsd.edu
	(received mail header)
		From: Joseph Luk <joluk@ucsd.edu@chem.ucsd.edu>
		To: Doug Book <dpb@ucsd.edu>


The last one is completely bizarre and *still* won't properly provide 
the correct To: address of <dpb@sdchemw1.ucsd.edu>.  Funny thing is, it 
seems that regardless of the setting of the two variables, whenever I 
send mail outside ucsd.edu, the recipient gets that bizarre tacked-on 
thing.  It's possible that this is a problem with the mail servers at 
chem.ucsd.edu tacking on the extra address, and separate from the domain 
mangling mentioned above.

There may be a set of problems here, and as you can see they're not 
minor ones.  If anyone else has had experience with domain names and 
PINE, please let me know!

Thanks,
Joe

Put whatever you want in a file named .signature (the initial dot is
required) in your home directory.  That works 99% of the time.  If it
doesn't, check your setup configuration menu within pine.

Adam,
The way I would approach this problem is as follows...

Goals:
 o Want to use IMAP and avoid NFS for performance and locking reasons.
 o Need multiple IMAP servers for scalability.
 o Want to preserve single email domain view.

Need:
 o An algorithm *OR* a database for mapping usernames
   into the name or cname of a mail server.
 o An MX mail forwarder for the email domain that uses the above algorithm
   or database.  (We use sendmail as the MTA).
 o A DNS server for the email domain that uses the above algorithm or
   database.

Configuration:
 o Clients are configured (using Pine terminology) to have an
   inbox-path=<username>.email.coventry.ac.uk
   e.g.
   inbox-path=ccx009.email.coventry.ac.uk

The customized DNS server for email.coventry.ac.uk would then return the
IP address of the mail server for user ccx009.

Because MX routing allows load sharing across multiple mail forwarders and
the the modified sendmail on the MX hosts and DNS servers allow use of
multiple mail servers, I believe this model could be scaled to support
very large numbers of users, on the order of hundreds of thousands,
though I/O (esp. seek) bandwidth probably limits each server to around 200
concurrent sessions.

You have to find the Editor   = <No Value Set> line in the configuration
menu.  From the Main Menu within Pine, type s for setup, c for
configuration, and space down to the last page of the menu and select the 
Editor   = line.

When no value is set for the alternate editor, Pine uses Pico.  Use the Add
Value command to change it to vi or emacs and maybe others for all I know.

At this point, Pine still uses Pico.  You have to find the
enable-alternate-editor- lines on screen two of the configuration menu and
pick one.  Enable-alternate-editor-cmd allows you to run emacs only when
you request it with the 'switch to alternate editor' command ^_.

Enable-alternate-editor-implicitly will run emacs automatically whenever
you compose or edit a letter.

There are several things which you can do.

If memory use is the concern, you can use one of the alternate mail
formats which do not require reading the entire folder into memory, such
as tenex, albeit at the cost of making text searches slower.  Refer to the
Pine technical notes for more defaults.

You must not use NFS with tenex format, though.  NFS is not a true UNIX
filesystem; it is a subset and lacks several important characteristics
(robust locking and atomic file/directory operations).  Tenex format uses
random access update-mode I/O which depends upon these.  So if you must
use NFS, you're pretty much stuck with UNIX mbox format.

Why do you think that this would be the case?  Sendmail should be using
the .lock file locking which works even over NFS.  [Not that I recommend
using NFS -- I don't.  It is always worse than local file access.]

This isn't necssarily a bad idea, since at some time you may want to split
users by workgroup or other category.

Hi 

This may not be exactly to do with mail but I use Pine to read mail
and news on a Unix account with my local University.  The problem with
my site is that they restrict the number and types of newsgroups to
those solely to do academic and research purpose. 

I have an acccount with an ISP with full newsgroup coverage but would
like to use their NNTP server to read them from Uni. 

I've tried changing the NNTP server in the config but I can't get
anything or else it defaults to the uni NNTP server.

Is there a way to pass along my user details to the other NNTP server
so that I can use Pine to read news with that server.

thanks

my site is that they restrict the number and types of newsgroups to
those solely to do academic and research purpose. 

I have an acccount with an ISP with full newsgroup coverage but would
like to use their NNTP server to read them from Uni. 

I've tried changing the NNTP server in the config but I can't get
anything or else it defaults to the uni NNTP server.

Is there a way to pass along my user details to the other NNTP server
so that I can use Pine to read news with that server.

thanks

There is a csh script that works well in conjunction with Pine.  It is
invoked as an "alternate editor" and will encrypt and/or sign outgoing
mail, and decrypt and/or check signatures on incoming mail.  To do the
trick on incoming mail, you pretend you're going to forward the mail,
forcing Pine to send it into the "alternate editor", whereupon PGP gets
a crack at it.

For information:

For the script, send blank email to the same address, with

Hi fellow 'netters,

My name is Yoshio Koseki and I recently started using a magazine
subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription
deal with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with
them.    They have over 1,500 different USA titles that they can ship to
any country on a subscription basis.   As for computer magazines from the
USA, they more of a selection than I ever knew even existed.  They have
magazines for most every area of interest in their list of 1,500 titles.

Within the USA, for their USA members, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.

Overseas, on the average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half
of what the newstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some
titles they are as little as one-tenth of what the newstands charge.  They
feel that mgazines should not be a luxury overseas.   In the USA, people
buy magazines and then toss them after reading them for just a few minutes
or hours.  They are so cheap in the USA!   Well, this company would like
to make it the same way for their overseas members.  They are also cheaper
than all their competitors in the USA and overseas, including the
publishers themselves!   This is their price guarantee.  Around one-half
their business comes from overseas, so they are very patient with new
members who only speak limited English as a 2nd language.

Their prices are so cheap because they deal direct with each publisher and
cut-out all the middlemen.

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

Please do not email me as I am just a happy customer and a *busy*
student.  I don't have time to even complete my thesis in time, let alone
run my part-time software business!  Please fill out the below form and
email to them at:

                       potential.new.members.info@0.5.5.1.7.6.9.8.1.7.1.tpc.int

*NOTE:   to make it easier for you to reply, I have put their address in
the "Reply-To" field, which means you can just use your email software to
reply to this message in order to get that address to pop-up in your "To:"
field.*

They guarantee to beat all their competitors' prices. Sometimes they are
less than half of the next best deal I have been able to find and other
times, just a little cheaper - but I have never found a lower rate yet. 
They assured me that if I ever do, they will beat it.  

They have been very helpful and helped me change my address from the USA
to Finland and then back again when I moved last month.  They are very
knowledgeable about addressing mags worldwide.

They have a deal where you can get a free 1 yr. sub to a new magazine from
a special list of over 300 popular titles published in the USA.   They
will give you this free 1 yr. sub when you place your first paid order
with them to a renewal or new subscription to any of the over 1,500
different popular USA titles they sell.  

They can arrange delivery to virtually any country and I think they have
clients in around 35 or 36 countries now.  Outside the USA there is a
charge for foreign postage and handling (on both paid and freebie subs)
that varies from magazine to magazine.  I have found their staff to be
very friendly and courteous.  They even helped me with an address change
when I moved from one country to another.
 
The owner thinks of his service as a "club" and his clients as "members"
(even though there is no extra fee to become a member - your first
purchase automatically makes you a member) and he is real picky about who
he accepts as a new member.   When he sets you up as a new member, he
himself calls you personally on the phone to explain how he works his
deal, or sometimes he has one of his assistants call.  He is kind of
quirky sometimes - he insists on setting up new members by phone so he can
say hi to everyone (I sure wouldn't want to have his phone bills!),  but
you can place future orders (after your first order) via E-mail.   

He has some really friendly young ladies working for him, who seem to know
just as much as he does about this magazine stuff.  If you live overseas,
he will even call you there, as long as you are interested, but I think he
still makes all his overseas calls on the weekends, I guess cause the long
distance rates are cheaper then.  

He only likes to take new members from referrals from satisfied existing
members and he does virtually no advertising.  When I got set-up, they had
a 2-3 week waiting list for new members to be called back so that they
could join up. (Once you are an existing member, they help you immediately
when you call. )  I think they are able to get back to prospective new
members  the same day or within a few days now, as they have increased
their staff.  I am not sure about this.........but if you email the above
form to them, that is the way to get started!

They will send you their DELUXE EMAIL CATALOGUE (around 525K-big and
juicey) !)...if you completely fill out the form above.  It has lists of
all the freebies, lists of all the titles they sell, titles broken down by
categories and detailed descriptions on nearly 1,200 of the titles that
they sell.

They then send you email  that outlines how his club works and the list of
free choices that you can choose from, as well as the entire list of what
he sells;  and then they will give you a quick (3-5 minute) friendly,
no-pressure no-obligation call to explain everything to you personally and
answer all your questions.

Once you get in, you'll love them. I do.


Sincerely,

Yoshio Koseki


ps.  please forward a copy of this message to all your friends on the net
who you think might be interested in it!  It is a great deal!  If you join
and then they join after you, you will earn a free 1 yr. subscription for
each new person you get to join after you join!   If you exceed 25
referrals, they let you use them to give away as gifts, for Christmas,
Chanukah or any other occassion.  Please be kind enough to mention my name
when you join.   I will then get a free magazine for a year for referring
you.
Thank you.

It might be that a mail gateway somewhere is stripping out the MIME
version header, so that Pine does not recognize the message as having MIME
encoding.

Inspecting the (normally hidded) headers of a sample message, as it looks
upon arrival, would confirm or deny this hypothesis.

I am frustrated by the limit of Pico and Pine at only using 1/2 of my

use only 23 or 24 lines.  Is there a configuration option that I have

I use "procmail", together with my own set of filters, to deliver my
incoming mail into multiple Tenex-format inboxes.  Since Pine doesn't
actually read my new mail out of /usr/spool/mail, I assume the above
trick with "mail.txt" wouldn't work for me.

Another thing I found useful, to ensure that new saved-mail folders
would be created in Tenex format, was to create a ".mminit" file in
my home directory, with the following content:

		    set empty-folder-format tenex

Without this, I ran into the problem that when I saved a message to
a brand-new folder, it was created in "Bezerkley" (traditional UNIX)
format.  I tried building a custom version of Pine with the default
folder type set to Tenex, but then I poked around the C-client library
code and discovered I could accomplish the task with the above line in
the ".mminit" file.

You don't say what your system configuration is, so I'll make my 
suggestions general.

Your 'folder' is a file located in a mail directory.  This file can be 
saved directly to floppy using a transfer method appropriate to your 
configuration.  For example, if you are running pine on a Unix 
workstation by dialing in with a PC, just download the file (with kermit, 
or zmodem, for example) with the floppy as the designated path.  If you 
don't have a transfer program on the Unix host, cat the  file with a log 
file open on your PC and capture the data to the log file.

Hope this gives you some ideas.  If you need more help, you will have to 
send more information about your setup.

Subject: AFS-aware IMAP daemon?
Date: 25 Oct 1995 21:55:37 GMT
Message-Id: <46mbop$nm8@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>
Status: O
X-Status: 


I administer an email system with approximately 26,000 users, of which 
several thousand are using IMAP.  We currently run on a cluster of 
workstations, but are soon to upgrade to an IBM RS/6000 parallel SP 
system.  At this time, we will be migrating our users to AFS.

At this time we anticipate using MIT Kerberos v4 for both AFS and SP 
authentication (since both AFS and the SP are compatible with Kerberos v4 
but not with each other's proprietary Kerberos).  However, we may end up 
using the AFS kaserver for reasons of expediency.  I don't think this 
changes the answer to my question, though.

My question has to do with my IMAP users.  Mail spools will continue to
reside in the Unix filesystem, not AFS.  Thus, as I understand it, there
is no need for an 'AFS-ized' IMAP daemon just to get at the inboxes of
users.  AFS does not come into this scenario.  A Kerberized daemon is
required so that the plaintext login can be authenticated to Kerberos. 

However, when an IMAP client makes a request for an archived mail folder
(such as the sent or saved messages), the daemon must get this information
from the user's home directory--which resides in AFS. 

Now, if we use the Cyrus imapd, a plaintext login (such as Pine, 
MailDrop, Siren Mail or Simeon Email use) will cause the imap daemon to 
get a Kerberos ticket.

This is where I get fuzzy, however.  I believe that a Kerberos ticket is
necessary but not sufficient to grant a process access to the AFS
filespace.  An AFS token is also required for a process to be able to 
read and write to an AFS filesystem.  Am I correct?

If so, are there any IMAP daemons out there (or any easy modifications to 
existing ones) that will allow access to AFS?

I have a question. How do you insert a text file into a message? Is there 
also a certain way to auto-respond using a text file if you recieve a 
piece of mail with a certain subject? Thank you for your time and thought 
for these questions.

NOTE:  I TRIED TO SEND THIS AS A PRIVATE REPLY BUT GOT A BAD ADDRESS 
MESSAGE, SO I'M POSTING IT TO LIST.  Ciao.  AK

Use the Rich Header and put all the addressees in the bcc field.  Then put
yourself in the to field.  They will see a letter addressed from you to
you, but no other addressees.  To get the rich header, put your cursor
somewhere in the header and type ^R (control R).  To be sure you haven't
made a mistake (sometimes I put the addresses in the cc filed by mistake,
which defeats the purpose) hit ^R again when you're done putting in the
addresses, and they all should disappear.  BTW, I assume you know how to
make an address of people who you send stuff to regularly so you don't
have to type addresses by hand every time.  If not, write back and I'll
advise.  Hope this helps.  Ciao.  AK

    Are you using some sort of PC, Mac, or Amiga (etc.) _and_ 
communications software to login to your Unix account?  I am, and I found 
that I had to tell _both_ my shell and my comm software about the new 
screen size.  (Unfortunately, I still had a problem with Unix Pine, and 
a posting I made here a few days ago has so far not been responded to.)

    Unfortunately, there is no single answer to your question.  It 
depends on what operating system you are uploading from, what operating 
system you are uploading to, and what software is available on each 
system.  You may have to provide more information about your setup.

    Put the cursor in the text area where you want to insert the file.  
Press Ctrl-R (for "read message," I think it is).  Answer the prompt with 
the filename (and path, if it is not in the current directory).

    Not with Pine as it stands.  You need to use other software to 
autorespond to a message, such as procmail under Unix.

Hi,
I just opened this pine account at my university and use my computer at 
home to sign on.  I'm trying to learn
how to use pine.  I'm VERY new to computers and really lost.  The only 
other e-mail/internet system I've used is America on line.  Is there any 
way to set pine up so that I can use windows and a mouse? Any suggestion 
about how to get it more user friendly would be wonderful.
Also, how would I join the same e-mail listst that I used on AOL?
I'm trying to join vetmed-l, but don't know how.
 THANKS.

How can I make Pine connect quickly to an SMTP server.  The way it works

This sounds like Spry's mail program does not understand the MIME Internet
standard that Pine uses for attachments.  Suggest *including* the text
file (^R) instead of *attaching* --or encourage your correspondent to get
a mailer that understands MIME.

Pine first tries to use "rsh" to make a pre-authenticated connection to 
your IMAP host (so you can have Pine start automatically without having 
to enter your username and password each time).

The delay you are experiencing is almost certainly because Pine is 
attempting this, but your IMAP server is not set up to allow it.

The easiest solution (certainly for the users) is to set this up.  This 
is done very simply:

1. On the IMAP server make a link from /etc/rimapd to your imapd
executable (and make sure the latter has at least x access to group and
others).

2. Next do whatever you need to get your IMAP server machine to trust your
other hosts so that the rsh mechanism works (either each user has to set
up a .rhosts file, or the administrator sets up a hosts.equiv file). Note 
that this would allow any user to rsh to the server and do anything, so 
if it is intended only as an IMAP server you may like to write a little 
shell replacement (for the password file entries) to only allow 
/etc/rimapd to be executed (this is the solution we went for here).

If you don't want to do this, then simply stick the explicit port number 
onto the end of your IMAP mail folder command within Pine's Setup 
Configuration screen (or weherever).  Eg,

	{imap.my.site:143}INBOX

Mark's question about Sendmail's ".lock" file locking begs me to ask a 
question which has been troubling me vaguely for some time now...

We are using Silicon Graphics kit, running IRIX.  This offers three types
of file locking calls: flock; lockf; fcntl.  Pine/imapd uses some subset
of these to take out locks on the mail folders (either directly, or on an
intermediate temporary file, I forget which). 

As far as I can tell from our sednmail man page sendmail *only* uses 
.lock file locking (creation of a file called username.lock in the 
/var/mail directory to lock the username file).

Pine/imapd will try and create such a file, but only if it has write 
access to the /var/mail directory.

We access mail via an IMAP server running on a machine with a locally 
mounted mail store disk (ie, no NFS involved).  However we cannot give 
everyone write access to the /var/mail directory, otherwise 
Undergraduates, being Undergraduates, will start misusing the area.

Am I right in saying, therefore, that we potentially have a window where 
Pine/imapd *can* conflict with sendmail's delivery?

And if so, how can it be resolved?  Other mailers (eg, Elm) run set-group 
to mail so that the software can create the necessary .lock files.  
However I have never seen anything indicating the Pine or imapd CAN be 
run like this safely, and various notes from users and the authors saying 
that it SHOULDN'T be run like this.

So what's the lowdown, please?

How do I save my e-mail from pine which I read on a power mac 8100 
through a telnet link to a powerbook 180?  If I can save it to a disk and 
then load it onto my powerbook that would be fine as well but I can't 
seem to figure out how to copy a folder of saved mail.  Do I need to copy 
each message separately but cutting and pasting or is there an easier way 
to do things?  HELP!

Does pine mangle foreign charsets, i.e. jis/new-jis?  I was having few or no
problems bringing jis-formatted (not shift-jis) into my japanese text editor
when I was doing it via a popmail client, but I've been having difficulties
since I started using pine again and ftp-ing the stuff to the machine I'm
on.  One time I had problems after I read the message in Pine and then
retrieved it via popmail.

I have used the "export" option to save the document into my home directory,
then I used ftp.  Is there a way to keep pine from mangling my mail, and can
I rescue the things I've been sent already?

Please give me more details in creating a signature. How do you access 
the file from Pine to create the signature?

We have setup a central mail server and we are using pine to read and
send mail.  Also, we have all the MX records set to our central mail
server.  However, there are those who still want to use mail to send out
mail messages from their local computers.  When using pine/imapd all the
mail gets delivered correctly from our central server.  However, when
sending mail from the local computers with mail it bounces because it
tries to deliver the mail to the user@local computer instead of the
central mail server.

I'm not a sendmail expert so my question is this.  Is there a way to
make the local computers deliver the mail to the central server?  MX
works, but not all the time.  Is it posible to force sendmail to put the
name of the central server in the from line, so it would look like 
user_id@central_server

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!

With any text editor (pico would be the easiest if 'yer a novice) type 
whatever you want your signature to say, then save it as filename 
'.signature'.   You don't do it while you're in the PINE program; From a 
unix prompt type 'pico' press enter, you should be on a blank page, start 
typing.  Hope this helps.

A comma ... but remember it's very bad usenet form to post the same

Oh, this is soooo great!  No problem then to keep 4MB+ folders in memory.
Please send me some money so I can buy some RAM to keep my 20MB mail log in
the memory.  Yes, I'd have to uncompress most of them before I can use them.

"rudimentary", eh?  So - which one do you suggest?

You can move to INBOX only by going to the folder list and hitting ENTER 
on the INBOX.  Otherwise you are in a different folder collection, and 
won't let you do that.  This, I believe, was his problem.

I am certain that upon further examination, you will find that lockf() is not
a system call, but rather a subroutine that invokes fcntl().  Furthermore, I'm
willing to bet that you will find that flock() is not implemented as a system
call, but rather is emulated by BSD compatibility and actually does fcntl().

lockf() is so simple just about any locking system call can implement it.  For
the most part, fcntl() can be used to emulate flock() except for two very
serious bugs in fcntl():
	1) If you do an open() on a file that you have already open and locked
	   the lock gets blown away.
	2) fcntl() tries to work over NFS via the rpc.lockd/rpc.statd daemons,
	   but this mechanism doesn't work worth a damn.

Both lock files and flock() are used in the Pine code, with the necessary
action taken to emulate flock() through fcntl() for those poor unfortunates
who were suckered into buying SysV ("consider it standard") systems.

Actually, it's done by /bin/mail (which is what sendmail usually invokes to
deliver mail -- look at the Mlocal line in your sendmail.cf).  But yes, it is
true that on almost all implementations of /bin/mail, only .lock file locking
is done.

This is alright; .lock file locking is exclusive which is what mail delivery
needs.  The only problem with .lock file locking is if the locker neglects to
remove the file, you'll have a stuck lock (hence you need timeouts when seeing
that a file is .lock locked against you).

This is true.

You should look into the proper setting of the "sticky" bit on /var/mail.  If
you have this set properly, you should not have the abuse problems.

You aren't the only site that has ill-advisedly turned off write access to the
mail spool.  You shouldn't do this unless you change /bin/mail to use flock()
style locking.  But you can't do that over NFS.

Absolutely so.  If you give the software no way to lock, you can't expect it
to lock!

> And if so, how can it be resolved?

Basically, you have a bad configuration, and you need to change something to
correct it.

One possible solution -- assuming you can get away with it -- is to remove NFS
access to /var/mail, and force all access to be via IMAP.  Tell the partisans
of Elm, etc., to fix their software to support IMAP.

Other, less brutal, solutions include setting the sticky bit correctly (which
fixes the mail security problems).  If undergrads use /var/mail as a scratch
file area, perhaps your real problem is that you don't give them enough disk
quota and/or enough scratch file area on /tmp (or wherever) and you should
resolve that.

And from time to time there are various security problems which pop up with
mailers that are given privileges.  Sometimes it is disasterous, such as the
infamous movemail security bug (granted, that guy was setuid root).  It was a
design feature from the very beginning that Pine/imapd would *not* require
privileges.

That's right.  The UNIX world is filled with people who think that the
solution to any access problem is to make software run privileged.  Without a
doubt, the setuid and setgid bits on files was one of the worst design
decisions made in UNIX from a security standpoint.

This is what makes UNIX so delightful to every net.brat on the planet (and is
why "secure" versions of UNIX disable setuid and setgid files), since any
vulnerability in any piece of software can be used to break in.  Sometimes you
need a cascade of vulnerability, such as subverting one program to create data
in a secure place that will be read by another program with higher privileges
but trusts that lower-level data.

You need to think in a different paradigm, which is "how can users do what
they want to do without requiring privileges?"  Or another way, suppose the
only software you supply is the shell and C compiler, how can users do what
they want to do if they have to write all the software?  By creating a "mail"
user group, you essentially make the writing of MUAs be a privileged
operation.

If you don't want to provide access through the normal filesystem calls, then
you have to provide access through other means.  One such means is POP and
IMAP.  Another such means is to implement a new system call that will let
unprivileged users do what they need to do.

Or, you need to separate the real threat (shanghaied mail files) from what is
essentially a non-threat (anyone can make a file in /var/mail).  The sticky
bit does most of what is needed.  You can also make /bin/mail (or whatever
delivers mail on your system) be much more cautious about what it will deliver
mail to (this is done in most newer implementations) to catch a shanghai after
the fact.  The remaining problems are then in the noise.  Yes, a brat could
create a false .lock file, but he'll need to do that every 5 minutes in order
for his harassment to have effect, and it's easy to catch the responsible
party.  Once caught, you have a social, not a technical problem.

Got an answer.  I had to type "stty rows 42" to get the rest of the

22 or 24.  Now all works well!

We spread the load of all of our e-mail users on (now) 6 UNIX boxes.
Users log on or telnet, etc. to these machines, but the mail server is
a machine they do not log on to. We have a script that tests the load
of the 'ecom' boxes to allow a user to log on to the one with the
lightest load and their files are available regardless of the machine,
via NFS mounting. The user's files live on one of two machines that
only (sort of) serve files via NFS.

All mail goes to and comes from our uxa box, the user logs on to ecom?
and files are on fsa or fsb. News is on another box.

Subject: $MAILCAP and mailcap file

I have a .mailcap file, which works great with Netscape to display 
PostScript documents.  Pine does not seem to find this mailcap file; it 
is in my home directory:

	~/.mailcap

I have tried to define $MAILCAPS=:$HOME/.mailcap: , but that didn't do 
anygood.  How should tell Pine that I have my own mailcap file ?

Thanks, Christian Labadie

Hello!

Do anybody know how to save on a floppy disk the  global and personnal
addressbook?
Can I use the same bookmark file for pine and netscape?

Thank you.

Since you've asked...  Here's fromf, a script I use that has three
levels of verbosity and some Tenex format support.  (The Pine tech notes
mention two formats; I only used the one I saw my Pine had created.)
You'll want to modify the string identifying the default mailbox by
pathname.

Enjoy,

I set this, but still when I try to compose a letter pico comes up.
I also tried this with enable-alternate-editor-cmd set and pico comes up.

Did I miss something, or is there a way to use a different editor
(implicity and without the C-_ command thing)?

there is now a line in my .pinerc file which reads

	features-list=enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

and another which reads

	editor=emacs


but pico still gets used. Any ideas?

  I tried this method. It doesn't quite work, due to a bug in Pine. This
issue was brought up in this newgroup about 2 weeks ago. 
  Although you put all the addresses in the BCC field, each of the
recipients can still see other recipients' addresses by looking at the
Apparently-To field (which can be launched by Rich Header).

Eric,
Note the important sentence "Then put yourself in the to field."
It is the absence of an entry in the To: field that causes sendmail to
generate the Apparently-To: header.

Note that we would assert that this is broken behavior of sendmail, not
Pine...  nonetheless, in 3.92 a message with only BCCs will have a
group-syntax To: line added that says "undisclosed recipients: ;" in order
to avoid this problem.

Commas, no spaces.  Works for me.

I also do this when I wish to trim down the number of groups to which
a followup is posted/crossposted.

However, I'm not posting this to comment on Dave's ideas.  Rather, now
that the subject has been broached, I'd like to air my own long time
wish for a different email storage architecture:  Instead of folders,
I'd like to have an inverted text database with specific recognition
of header fields and inter-message referencing, so that I could tell
my MUA things like

- show me all mail to or from Dave during the last two months
- list all mail items with "Pine" in the subject field
- find mail from someone at cmu.edu that mentioned CMUCL in the text

and so on.  I'm not sure what sort of query language would be best,
but it should probably be something that could do simple boolean
expressions in English, and be able to store these as macros to be
called by name or through keyboard bindings.  A MUA using this concept
would come with a set of commonly used macros already bound to
keyboard shortcuts, of course -- single key commands for the most
"normal" actions, including stuff like (when you're reading a newly
arrived mail item) "list the items making up the context of this one".

Comments, anyone?

    Thanks for posting this.  It had been suggested to me to set 'stty 
rows _43_' and that was causing the problem.  Unix Pine and ProComm seem 
to be happy now with 42 rows.  Unfortunately, things get a little 
confused if I try to switch back to 25-line mode in mid-session.

Christian,
To find out what's happening, try the following:
Run
  pine -d9
Then view a non-text attachment.
Then quit Pine.

Now look at your .pine-debug1 file and search for "mailcap: " lines.
You should see something like:

- mailcap_can_display -
- mc_init -
mailcap: path: /usr/shivausers/gray/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap
mailcap: process_file: /usr/shivausers/gray/.mailcap
mailcap: processing file: /usr/shivausers/gray/.mailcap
mailcap: processing entry: image/*; xv %s ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"


Please let us know what you discover.

Jill,

    Take heart, Pine is the most user friendly email system for the old
style keyboard approach to computers, so your learning curve with Pine
will not be more difficult than necessary.  Coming from a Graphical
User Interface (windows and mouse), as you do, there will be some
frustrations but not too many, I hope.

    I'm a mouse guy from way back in '88 when I brought home the Amiga
I'm using now.  I'm also a heavy keyboard guy too; since I do a lot of
networking.  As you have discovered, many 'dial-in' computers only
support keyboard access.  They do this because it is easier to
implement and it makes the fewest assumptions about the workstations
they serve.  The advantage of learning both is you will broaden your
skill base, learn the differences between the two interfaces, and be
able to judge for yourself when one may be better to use than the other.

    As for Pine, you will not find (I don't think) a window/mouse
interface.  Pine was intentionally designed to be controlled from the
keyboard and works on almost every type of computer: Amiga, UNIX, Mac,
etc.  Pine has a philosophy about being user-friendly: the beginner
should be protected from making mistakes.  This is a common approach to
user-friendliness but there is a problem with this approach.  As users
of any program become more proficient, the protections become a
nuisance.  Pine's solution to this is to provide a large number of
configuration options in its Setup list.  At some point in your
learning adventure, you may wish to visit this area and use the '?' to
read more about each feature. Many features may not mean anything to
you but learning about them will allow you to solve problems as you go
along.

    If the email list 'vetmed-l' is distributed by a list server you
can send a request to that server asking for distribution to your new
email address.

Correct...Been playing some with egrep, seems the following works, havent 
tested it much yet though...Im sure theres some case whereas it doesnt 
work.

alias from	'more $MAILPATH | egrep "^From: | ^From "

Message-Id: <J.Wolff.48.01C3017F@forprod.csiro.au>
Status: O
X-Status: 

I have an IMAP user who has been banished to field work with a DOS-based 286 
laptop. I have been trying to get the packet version of pcpine 3.91 to 
work with the U of Minnesota "umslip" serial line packet driver to allow him 
to access his existing mail store, but am not having much success. 

umslip loads ok and connects to my dialup router (a Netblazer), pktstats 
shows a packet driver on 0x60, the ping  program ex CUTCP works ok, and 
minuet work OK, so I figure this end of it is working.

But pcpine doesn't like it, and is unable even to resolve the mailhost name 
over umslip. Modem lights and a trace on the dialup router show DNS packets 
being sent and received, but no action results. (I haven't tackled the 
protocol analyser yet to check the content of the packets).

Using the IP address instead of server name in the inbox definition 
produces an IMAP protocol exchange with the mailhost, but pine quits 
with "connection broken by server" (or words to that effect). Syslog on the 
imap server does not show a connection ever having been established.

However, exactly the same pcpine configuration works fine over an ethernet 
packet driver on a desktop machine (lsl/smc8000/odipkt24). 

So both halves of the setup work independently, but they just don't seem to 
communicate at the packet layer. Any light on this problem would be much 
appreciated, or any suggestions for an alternative dial-up system that will 
work with Pine on a DOS-based 286.

Also: I can not get pcpine to produce a debug file as described in the tech 
notes, even if started with -d9. Is this supposed to work, or is there a trick 
to this too?

Many thanks,

Alan,
We now have about 40,000 users on our primary email cluster,
with 2-3,000 concurrent sessions.

(Caveat: we are just now implementing the DNS-based client binding
mentioned below; we're using a homebrew hack right now, but I don't forsee
any scaling problems with the DNS binding model. )

Yes.... using Pine 3.91 first go to the Setup Configuration screen (S 
then C from the Main Menu) and enable the "aggregate command set".  
Whilst there type a question mark to see the built-in help about this.

Return to your news folder and type the four characters:

	; A A D

Things should becoe clear as you watch the menu at the bottom of the 
screen as you do this.

Hi all!

Anybody know what is "pine-use"? 
I found it in pine(3.91) source directory, and built by "build pine-use".
When i run pine-use, i've got :
>    1: last week
>    1: last two weeks (+0)
>    1: last month (+0)
>    0: last year
>    0: more than a year

>    0: Average messages in inbox  (0/1)
>    0: Largest inbox in messages
>   23: Total users checked
>    0: signature files

What is it?

Here is what I found in the Tech Notes (excerpts slightly edited by me), I
hope it answers your Q:

          Pine checks for new mail in the INBOX and  in  the
          currently  open  folder  at  least every two and a
          half minutes.  It used to be 30 seconds instead of
          150  seconds,  but  we  increased  it  in order to
          reduce the load on large systems with lots of Pine
          users.   The  value can be changed at compile-time
          in the pine/os.h file.  If you really  don't  want
          to wait you can force a new mail check by pressing
          N Next with the cursor on the last message of  the
          message  index  or  by redrawing the screen with a
          ^L.

          Most of Pine's  behaviors  are  set  in  the  file
          ./pine/osdep/os-xxx.h,   which  includes  comments
          that explain each setting.  Some of these can only
          be  set when you compile.  Others, however, can be
          overridden by command-line flags to Pine  or  set-
          tings  in  Pine's  user  or  system  configuration
          files.  Some of the options which can be set  when
          compiling:
 
               NEW_MAIL_TIME:   Interval  between   new-mail
               checks. Default is 150 seconds.

Enjoy!

I've written a short and crude awk script to do this, but
its not ideal.

  A few weeks ago I switched to Tenex format for inbox and work-on folders.=
=20
Fortunately only for these two. I met the two following problems:

1) Message shrank massages--very often and in situations when neither CR
nor NULL characters were present. These messages were fine in Berkeley
format folders: One example -- I cannot saved to a Tenex folder, I could
to a Berkeley one (from Berkeley). I copied the source folder, piped it
through `tr -d '\015' | tr -d '\000' ' command--the size didn't
changed!--and then there was the same situation.=20

2) My mail.txt got unopenable by pine -- there is some error inside. I
think some pointer points to a line which doesn't contein a valid pointer.
Error message is `Cannot parse ...'. This mail.txt folder has about 1.5 MB
and I need to use messages that it contains. Is there any utility which
could help me to recover the folder? Or convert it back to Berkeley
format--this would be much better!=20

  In my opinion Tenex format is a good thing but its support in pine 3.91
has some bugs. thanks for any help or advice. V. S.=20

Aehem, isn't this an useless use of more? egrep "..." $MAILPATH should give the same result.

On many systems, MAILPATH is a colon separated list of files, not just one file. Something
like

OIFS=$IFS
IFS=:
set -- $MAILPATH
IFS=$OIFS
egrep "^From: |^From " $@

is probably better in these cases.

We are using Bcc to send out a mail message to a large list of users.
People who read the message with pine do not see the Bcc header list,
however, people reading mail with Eudora or mail do see the complete
header list.  The list is very long 200+ names and people are getting
upset having to page over the header list.  Can anyone tell me what the
solution is?

Thanks!

Well, you didn't say exactly how the list appears in Eudora ("To:", 
"Bcc:", "Apparently-To:", etc.), so I'll answer what I think you're 
asking.  When you use Bcc:, you must include at least *one* recipient on 
the "To:" line, otherwise you will see a whole slew of "Apparently-To:" 
lines, thus making the blind cc's un-blind.  If that's not what's 
happening to you, then you have a different problem.

TTFN,

Steve

    Not in Pine, at least as of version 3.91.  However, depending on what 
operating system you are running under, you may be able to use software 
which preprocesses the mail before Pine ever sees it.  You could implement 
a kill that way.  Procmail under Unix is one way (although for anything 
beyond the simplest mail filtering it helps to be Unix-experienced to use 
procmail most effectively).

You can not save to a different type folder.  In other words, you can save
from Berkeley to Berkeley, or Tenex to Tenex, but you can't save from Berkeley
to Tenex.  This is a restriction at the present time.

Also, "tr -d '\000'" doesn't do anything useful in most versions of tr.

The complete error message gives you the exact character position at where the
problem began.  Read the file in emacs, then move to that position in the
file.  The cursor should be at the very start of an internal header line,
which is in the format:
	10-Mar-1995 08:09:28 -0800,1384;000000000021
Note the field between the comma and the semicolon (1384 in this example).
This is the size in bytes of the following message.  If the cursor is not at
the exact start of this internal header line, scroll back in the mail file and
find the internal header line of them previous message.  Check that count.
You'll find that it is wrong for some reason.

Perhaps that message got trashed, or some garbage got appended to the end of
the mail file.  Either way, either fix the count, or alter the subsequent text
so that the count is right.

I wonder if this problem below came about by using some other program to
forcibly save a Berkeley format message into a Tenex folder.  That's a very
likely scenario.  If the cursor points at "From ", then that's what you did.

    Assuming you are current on Pine (version 3.91), from the Main Menu 
go into Setup and Config.  On the first screen should be a field named 
default-fcc.  Provided this is not set to null or blank, it contains the 
name of the default folder to which all mail is saved unless you specify 
otherwise for a specific piece (either explicitly or through the 
addressbook).  Normally, if you do nothing there will be an annotation 
that the default folder "sent-mail" is being used.

I am running pine 3.91 on a linux server. I have recieved some mail with a 
large binary MIME attachment (5MB). When I try to read it (to see the text 
part and save the attachment) I get an 'Out of free storage' message. 

Is there a way of increasing the storage space or is this just too big to
be practical? I couldn't see any options in the setup configuration.

Thanks in anticipation.  :-)

	For the record, I use 3.91.  Note that he suggests a *single*
keystroke.  Your advice is correct, but it takes at least 2 keystrokes to
select ... ; + {enter} ... As far as I can tell, there is no way to select
with a single keystroke.  I second David's motion.  A *single* keystroke
would be very nice.  (NB:  what a nice program Pine is, if this is all we 
have to bitch about :)

	If you have a lot of items you want to select from a list, you can
select by concatenating message numbers.  I.e., type ; then 1,3,6,7-10,14
etc.  If the list goes beyond the first page, close out the selection (the
selected numbers are highlighted), go to the next page and repeat the
message number selection process.  When you're finished selecting, use
'A' and proceed with whatever evil intention you have for those messages 
unlucky enough to have been singled out  :)

 | How can I change the reply-line?

I read another news-message after it, in which somebody (forgotten who) 
explained how to change the quote-symbols (e.g. " | " insetad of "> ").

I realised this would also solve MY problem. I wrote a Gofer-program that 
can be treated as an alternative editor (by the command ^_). When you
immediately start it after you gave the command 'R' (Reply), then it 
transforms your reply-message. After that you return in the standard 
pine-editor, and proceed replying.

When the e-mail looked this way:

The program transforms it into:

Hi Edward Davidson, you said:

 | Hi Koen,

I made the "Hi ", ",you said:" and the " | " variables.

Does anyone wants to have it? It is a Gofer-program, so you will need a 
Gofer-compiler or interpreter.

    Saving of sent-messages is under your control.  If you wish, you can 
set Pine up so that no outgoing message is saved unless you explicitly 
direct otherwise.  Assuming you are using version 3.91, just go into 
Setup/Config.  On the first screen is a field, "default-fcc:".  If you 
set this to null, Pine should not save messages unless you tell it 
otherwise when composing.  In this case, setting to null may mean either 
two double-quote marks abutted, or it might mean two double-quote marks 
with a space in between, I don't recall which.  You might have to 
experiment slightly.

Well, "initial-keystroke-list=i,h,m" is doing the job (thanks to

from another PINE user).  And I've been a Unix sysadmin for 5 years. 

Certainly in the UK, there's very little talk of IMAP, which is disappointing,
as it looks like it might be the answer to my configuration problems.  That's
if someone would answer my posting and tell me how to get it to work on Solaris
with NIS (dig!).

He still should be able to compress his mail file because MAIL is 
installed with the EXQUOTA privilege.  Otherwise, he would really be in a 
rut.  I was over quota before, and I could still compress my mail.

You can't without knowing what the person on the recieving end is using.
For instance, the above (which I assume is ISO-8859-1?) appears as a
'u' with an acute accent with a PC character set (some PC terminal
emulators, Wyse terminals etc.).

  If you use MIME (which, since you are posting to the Pine newsgroup
I assume you are) you can specify the character set you intended the
message to be viewed in but you can't ensure that the recipient has
that character set or can convert to it reliably.

  The answer is to spell out "pounds" in full. In fact you should
qualify it with "sterling" or whatever since not all pounds are the
same. A similar point should apply to the use of "dollars" since
they are even more variable than pounds.

popclient may be downloaded from ftp.mal.com/pub/pop.  Sunsite no
longer carries it.

I installed it recently under Linux and it works great.  Compiled
without any problem.  Is small, (relatively) simple, and effective
at fetching mail from POP3 servers.  Loads the mail into your local
machine's mailbox, and you read it from there using "mail" (or
Pine) just as if it was sent directly to your local machine.
All character-based, no GUIs or anything - it's so simple it doesn't
need them.

IMHO, the Pine people ought to contact the author about embedding
popclient into Pine - stick it under a menu option or something.
It's just what Pine needs (brass statement, since I know nothing
about Pine internals!)

When I developed my WinBiff program (a Windows email notifier), I went
for POP3 first.  That's where the current demand is.  It was almost
trivial to add IMAP support, because the IMAP protocol, while offering
more options, isn't that different from POP3.  Adding IMAP was 
about 100 lines of code, not much.  I think the Eudora people could add 
IMAP support almost as easily.

My office has several hundred users who use Pine email via telnet to our
Sun server.  We would like to give users the option of using one of the
new Windows client mail programs such as Eudora, Email Connection, or Pegasus.

The problem is that our users move around alot; one day they may be on their
home PC and use Eudora, the next; they will be on a Pine (via telnet) PC.
If I use default Pop settings, the user's Unix mailbox will be emptied
(Not good).  If I tell the Pop client not to delete mail on server, the user
gets a dozen copies of their unread mail (full load on each mail check).

Is there a way to make Pop grab only messages that the client doesnt already
have in their local PC inbox ?

Thanks you any help

Subject: Reading News with Pine: marking read articles

Hello,

I like using Pine for both News and Mail, but my only gripe is the way 
Pine marks news articles as 'read'. I understand that the manner in which 
news is marked in Pine is done 1) within the limitations of what is 
stored in the .newsrc file and 2) it is as consistent as possible with 
Pine mail. However, I'm not interested in deleting/excluding articles - 
all I'd like would be an 'N' if I hadn't read the article, and no 'N' if 
I had. Is this possible in Pine ?

I've tried the news-approximates-new-status option, but found that to be 
even more confusing.

thanks,

After help with the local consultants, we managed to fix the problem.  
I've posted this from Pine instead of Tin.  It turned out that Pine 3.91 
had a problem handling my personal name.  First, it was "Love is not 
shared pleasure.  It's shared pain." only without the quotes, and either 
Pine or the NNTP server didn't like it.  So I tried it with the quotes, 
and they didn't like that either.  Finally, I deleted the personal, which 
Pine then sets it from the passwd file.  Mine is now "Steven C. King", 
with the quotes, and now I can post.  ??????????????  Go figure.  Again, 
thanks to those who provided assistance in clearing this problem up.  :)

And I was a little bit off the subject.  If you want to compress in Pine, 
you'll have to mark the messages you don't want as Deleted.  That's about 
all you can do to "compress" from Pine I do believe.

Subject: simple unix popmail client available

Interested in a simple POP3 client for Unix?  I spent a few minutes
cleaning up the MIT popmail (UCB Mail + POP3) kit and stuck it on
ftp.cic.net:/pub/Software/unix/mail/popmail.shar.gz

Should build on BSD-ish systems without much fuss.

This is a redistribution of the rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/popmail distribution.

All credit goes to the original authors.  (But some of us can't deal
with Athena Imakefiles ;)

Good for testing POP servers.  Also works as a normal Berkeley mail client.

Enjoy.

I think I saw something about this posted to the list previously, but I 
have not been on lately so I don't remember what the outcome was.

Could anyone please tell me if Pine can send messages to an X.400 
address. We need to communicate with another company and would like to 
see if we can do so with the our current resources. We use sendmail as 
our mail transport and Pine as our mail reader.

Please email all responses to me as I am no longer subscribed to the 
list. TIA.

I've just started playing around with PINE, and realized that the 
default MIME encoding for Attachments is BASE64.  I don't know much about 
MIME, but I would guess this is the de-facto standard.

The only problem I have is that if I want to attach a simple text file, 
it gets BASE64'd for no real purpose.  I like the convenience of Pine's 
attachment viewer, but there are A LOT of people who don't use MIME-aware 
tools.  Yes, it's their loss, but is there some way I can specify that a 
text attachment not be encoded at all?  Or how about BinHex or something?

Even if it was possible - it is not a good idea to send mail from address A
and make it look like it came from address B.

In that case you should add a "Reply-To: address" header to your mail
which tells MUAs to send replies to the address stored within.

>as elm?

Yes, it can be done with ELM.
You can have the "Reply-To:" added to each outbound mail by adding it to the
"elmheaders" file.  Take a look at this page for more info:

Apologies in advance if this is off-topic. I'm a
newbie who's about as newbieish as they get.

I grabbed the Next and SunOS pico executables from
ftp.cac.washington.edu. The SunOS one worked great.
The Next one, however, had a problem. Whenever you
edit a line, it tries to justify it for you. The
situation is so bad that you can't even break a line
in half. It simply won't let you. I tried compiling
from source and got the same problem. Can you tell
me why the Next is causing pico to behave like this?
Is there some setting which must be made prior to
compilation in order to keep this from occuring?

    Did your autoexec.bat file have the read-only attribute set?  I keep 
mine read-only to help avoid accidental deletion.  That might explain 
your problem.

In pine, go to the main menu, then setup|config.

When you find 'enable-full-headers-command' check it.
Then, the command is 'h' or 'H', (not case sensitive).

Now if anyone can tell me why the similar command in 'tin' fails for me, 
I'll be happy.  (Ctrl-h resultxs in 'Bad Command' error message.  Maybe it

Good News:
:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:
I was able to add two new features to Pine 3.91 that makes it possible
to send mail using  `Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit'  instead of
`Content-Transfer-Encoding: Quoted-Printable'  thanks to patches
supplied by Per Hedeland <per@erix.ericsson.se>, and originally from
Ming-Yen Hsu <myhsu@db.csie.ncu.edu.tw>:

Hi, following patch added two new features for Pine which can
be set from Setup in Pine and controlled from pinerc.

* enable-send-only-8bit         Send out 8 bit character with 8BIT
                                content-transfer-encoding instead of
                                QP or BASE64.
* enable-8bit-in-subject        Allow 8 bit editing in Subject field.

  These two features should be useful if you and recipient are both
using 8 bit clean MTAs, and the MUA is not MIME capable. Disable these
features if you find there were MTAs which will strip message into
7 bit.

  Hope this help before Pine 3.92 comes to real. :-) 

PS: The patch is also available by a email to myhsu@db.csie.ncu.edu.tw
    with "Retrieve pine-for-8bit" in the Subject field.

Bad News:
:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:
Sendmail 8.7 can handle this well, but not previous Sendmail's, so when
sendmail 8.7 is used to send mail to non-8BITMIME machines without the new
F=8 mailer flag (see SENDMAIL RELEASE NOTES below), the default behaviour
is to convert labelled 8BITMIME input to 7BIT as required. This will happen
if the input is 8bit and properly labeled as 8bit (as it would be from the
patched Pine or exmh) and contains characters with the eighth bit set. What
happens then is that sendmail 8.7, using the code in mime.c, outputs the
8 bit body in 7 bit format, usually, if less than or exactly 1/8 of the
total characters have the eighth bit set, using Quoted-Printable.

If more than 1/8 of the total characters have the eighth bit set, mime.c
(sendmail 8.7) will use base64.

The  `well, not too bad'  news is that sendmail 8.7 can be configured to
let 8bit slip through unharmed even to non-8BITMIME machines using the
F=8 mailer flag in sendmail.cf. LET'S PRAY ALL SWEDISH SENDMAIL
ADMINISTRATORS DOES THIS!

                        SENDMAIL RELEASE NOTES
             @(#)RELEASE_NOTES  8.7 (Berkeley) 9/17/95

[..................]

        Eight-to-seven bit MIME conversions.  This borrows ideas from
                John Beck of Hewlett-Packard, who generously contributed
                their implementation to me, which I then didn't use (see
                mime.c for an explanation of why).  This adds the
                EightBitMode option (a.k.a. `8') and an F=8 mailer flag
                to control handling of 8-bit data.  These have to cope with
                two types of 8-bit data: unlabelled 8-bit data (that is,
                8-bit data that is entered without declaring it as 8-bit
                MIME -- technically this is illegal according to the
                specs) and labelled 8-bit data (that is, it was declared
                as 8BITMIME in the ESMTP session or by using the
                -B8BITMIME command line flag).  If the F=8 mailer flag is
                set then 8-bit data is sent to non-8BITMIME machines
                instead of converting to 7 bit (essentially using
                just-send-8 semantics).  The values for EightBitMode are:
                    m   convert unlabelled 8-bit input to 8BITMIME, and do
                        any necessary conversion of 8BITMIME to 7BIT
                        (essentially, the full MIME option).
                    p   pass unlabelled 8-bit input, but convert labelled
                        8BITMIME input to 7BIT as required (default).
                    s   strict adherence: reject unlabelled 8-bit input,
                        convert 8BITMIME to 7BIT as required.  The F=8
                        flag is ignored.
                Unlabelled 8-bit data is rejected in mode `s' regardless of
                        the setting of F=8.

Worse News (but old news):
:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:
According to RFC 1521 he Quoted-Printable encoding REQUIRES that encoded
lines be no more than 76 characters long. See below excerpt. BUT PINE 3.91
CONVERTS A LINE  EXACTLY 76 CHARACTERS LONG  AS IF IT WAS TOO LONG! This
can cause serious problems, if the line is a sentence ending with a `.' in
the 76'th and last position. Pine 3.91 will then move down the `.' to a
separate line, and put a `=' in position 76 on the original line.

Pine would be better off doing nothing with this line, but as it is, a new
line consisting of a single `.' is created.

This is BAAAAD, because there exist a lot of Local Delivery Agents, mis-
configured sendmail.cf's and old firewall software out there that will
CUT A MESSAGE AT THIS POINT! It is ***UNWISE*** to say the least, to send
an E-mail containing a line consisting of a single `.'.

Known culprits: Some different Delivery Agents used from the Mlocal line
in sendmail.cf, like HP-UX /bin/mail or some version(s) of "mail.local".
Suspected culprits: TIS Firewall Toolkit 'smapd' ("from what I can see in
the source-code, it calls sendmail without the '-oi'",
Per Hedeland <per@erix.ericsson.se> writes.)

This is part of my motive for NOT WANTING the Quoted-Printable encoding,
but rather the 8bit. It is actually a combination of a MUA (Pine)
`Feature', and a number of bugs and misconfigurations on the Internet
that is the culprits.

Borenstein & Freed                                          [Page 18-19]

RFC 1521                          MIME                    September 1993


      Rule #5 (Soft Line Breaks): The Quoted-Printable encoding REQUIRES
      that encoded lines be no more than 76 characters long. If longer
      lines are to be encoded with the Quoted-Printable encoding, 'soft'
      line breaks must be used. An equal sign as the last character on a
      encoded line indicates such a non-significant ('soft') line break
      in the encoded text. Thus if the "raw" form of the line is a
      single unencoded line that says:

          Now's the time for all folk to come to the aid of
          their country.

      This can be represented, in the Quoted-Printable encoding, as

          Now's the time =
          for all folk to come=
           to the aid of their country.

      This provides a mechanism with which long lines are encoded in
      such a way as to be restored by the user agent.  The 76 character
      limit does not count the trailing CRLF, but counts all other
      characters, including any equal signs.

Synopsis:

This is an attempt to summarise problems uncovered in divers places and
programs used in E-mail delivery in connection with e.g. Quoted-Printable
coded E-Mail (e.g. from Pine) and other mail that may contain "." - lines.
It turns out that problems can arise in several places, depending on
operating system and sendmail distribution version and configuration.

Summary:

See above Synopsis. E-Mail can easily contain "." lines without the user
being aware of this. In several places along an E-Mails path to the
recipient, anything from the "." to the end of the message may be lost.
Quoted-Printable coding may produce "."-lines, where there was none before!
Known culprits:	Some different Delivery Agents used from the Mlocal line
in sendmail.cf, like HP-UX /bin/mail or some version(s) of "mail.local".

I never proposed this! I simply proposed to avoid single dot-lines, by
always moving down a little more than the trailing "." from a line that
was considered too long (or why not avoid moving it altogether!).

Patrik is partly right. *MOST* of my problems is caused by local
delivery agents. But not all. My initial problem mail

*FROM*	Leif Erlingsson	<leierl@rsv.svskt.se>
*TO*	Per Hedeland	<per@erix.ericsson.se>

didn't fail for this reason. I managed to send identical mails

*FROM*	Leif Erlingsson	<Leif.Erlingsson@mailbox.swipnet.se>
*TO*	Per Hedeland	<per@erix.ericsson.se>

without any problems at all!	Check out the letter from near the
top of this very long E-mail. Search for the word 'smapd'!

Pine works fine with MH folders, I used it for awhile myself. Another

Is there any way to pipe messages that are "about to be composed" or 
"about to be replied to" through external programs?

I'd like to take a message that I get, and pass it through to a sed script
or through PGP for signaturing, and have it pop back into the pine
composer of my choice after it does its thing? 

I guess I'd like to take the contents of the editor, invoke an alternate 
script with ctrl-_, and have it do its magic... 

Anybody have a smart little trick for this or just a hint of how to 
redirect the editor contents to a temp file, dump the contents of editor, 
and read-in the contents of the processed file?

thanks.

	Your question is not really a pine issue.  The only thing you
need is information about your X.400 gateway.....if you know of one.

	Here we have an X.400 GW on our MTA so it is a simple matter
of using the X.400 address.  Our sendmail then notices that the
adress is an X.400 address and does the appropriate conversions.

Well, POP3 itself doesn't have that feature.

But Eudora keeps track of the messages it's downloaded, so
even if you don't set it to delete messages on the server,
you'll get just one copy of a given message.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8BIT
Status: O
X-Status: 

The new code in mime.c in sendmail 8.7 is able to convert 8bitMIME to
7bitMIME. Normal text with national 8-bit characters turn into 
Quoted-Printable. This happens when the sendmail at the other end isn't 
Mime-aware, and the text is properly labeled as 8bit, the way a
Mime-aware MUA like eg Exmh would do. (Or Pine 3.91-8bit, a patch available
from myhsu@db.csie.ncu.edu.tw with "Subject: Retrieve pine-for-8bit".)

Pine 3.91 also converts such texts to 7bitMIME, Quoted-Printable.

The PROBLEM is that most sentences people write end in a `.', and that
both mime.c and Pine 3.91 will wrap lines 74 / 76 characters long or
longer, even if the 74'th or 76'th character is a `.'. (mime.c: 74,
Pine: 76. This count is AFTER the national characters have been
converted to Q-P.)

Why is this a problem?

Because both sendmail 8.7 and Pine 3.91 will place the 74'th or 76'th
character on the next line. If this character is a `.' and no other
characters follow, MANY MAILERS AND DELIVERY AGENTS OUT THERE WILL CUT
THIS MAIL AT THIS POINT!

Let tin use another file:  tin -f ~/.tin-news (or whatever).

Use archie to find the program 'popclient'
It will download your mail from the pop server to a local unix account,
which you can read with /bin/mail, Mail, elm, or whatever.

Please consult your netiquette guidelines in news.announce.newusers
 
There is a mail server that will automatically respond to your
request for an FAQ, if you don't have an easier way to get FAQs.
 
I'm posting this to the group just in case there are other uninformed
users that think it's a good idea to pester the whole world with

That is exactly the way to do it.  You need to write a script that
takes a file name argument (which will be provided by pine), does it's
stuff on that file, and then calls your favorite editor on the modified
file.  It just needs to write out its changes to the same file name
before it exits.

If you want a model to work from, take a look at mkpgp (a csh script which 
when called as the alternative editor handles PGP stuff).  You can
get it from

Send mail to

 deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu

with the subject "send mkpgp" (I think) for info.
You can also get it from various PGP archives (one that I know has
it, but is a bit far from you is ftp.ox.ac.uk in /pub/crypto/pgp/utils

There are other similar scripts, one called BAP which I believe is
a bourne shell script, that do similar things.

Anyway, you can take one of these, and rip out the calls to PGP and 
ispell, and put in what you want.

Your automagic forward is incorrect.  It should ``Bounce'' mail and
not ``forward'' it.  How was that set up?  You may have to talk to
your local admins about that.

	In your .forward file include the line \username.  This will
allow a copy to be kept on that machine.

In any environment where an IMAP client can reach multiple mailboxes
it should be easy to arrange having them all forwarded to a single
point anyway.  What I've always wanted is a single news client that
could access local newsgroups from many sites seamlessly, posting
responses back to the right places.  Part of the popularity of

Perhaps I mistated the situation. To give more details:

	At Penn State, every registered student is given a POP account for
email, news etc. All of this information is tied into the PH database. If it
matters, system security and userid authentification is handled by Kerberos,
and the PH server is Qi Server version 2.2.

	I have my POP account set via 'make email' to gostin@crayola....,
instead of going to the normal POP server <60K users on a POPmail system gets
a little, shall we say... unreliable>. My POP account is listed as
jgostin@psu.edu. When mail comes in for psu.edu addresses <the POPmail
addresses>, a lookup is done to see where mail for that particular address'
mail is set to go to. In other words, jgostin@psu.edu is a 'front' account.

	In my case, instead of being forwarded to the POP server, my mail goes
to my UNIX account, where I can use PINE, and other such goodies. :-) But, the
TO header is not rewritten to account for the forwarding, bouncing,
hand-waving, or whatever. Instead, mail shows up at my UNIX account with the
TO header reading jgostin@psu.edu.

	Whenever I go to reply to such messages, even if I'm the only
recipient, PINE asks if I want to respond to all addresses <recipients?>. I'd
like a way to tell PINE to stop being so anal about it. :-)

Thanks, in advance, for any insights or information. :-)

There was a fellow at nokia working on something that looked like a 
Xwindows frontend for Pine. It may have been a standalone program, the 
details escape me............

It was also named after a kind of tree: Spruce

There was a web page that had a preview picture of it, it looked quite 
nice!

Because of problems with my news server, I've been using the aggregate 
command set in order to delete large numbers of unwanted posts.

Now, since Pine can't actually delete news messages, I'm wondering...

Is Pine making some huge file to keep track of the hundreds of messages I 
don't want to see?  I only have 250 Kb of account space, and I don't want 
to fill it up with news configuration files if I don't have to.

Thanks.

     Pine is interactive.
     To set up what you want you need to use crontab to issue a command
     at a given time, and a non-interactive mail command

No, that's not the problem.  I am constantly modifying my startup files, 
or having them added to by newly installed programs.  I just back them up 
perodically under a different name, in a different directory.  The 
problem is definitely Pico-Related.  Any other text editors work, and if 
I moved Pico to the root, I would not have a problem with Attoexec.bat 
and Config.sys, but would not be able to write to a file in another 
directory.  I guess one not-so desirable solution would be to copy the 
program to every directory that has ASCII text files.

Don't count on that working. Our site appends the generic domain name to
 even Reply-To:, which REALLY screws things up.
 EG: Reply-To: Robert.Rolf@UAlberta.ca becomes Robert.Rolf@ee.ualberta.ca
which won't work since only UAlberta.ca knows how to handle the
First.Last@ form.

Unfortunately, a lot of listserves (at least the ones I've been on)
don't handle that properly. They insist on using the  From: line
to create the outgoing address (and for verification of incoming posts).

Since my outgoing From: is different than the one I use coming in (mailbus),
I'm having a devil of a time posting to lists that have my old address form,
or I end up with two copies of mail when I resubscribe. I can't delete
the old address, which is still valid, since I don't look like that address
anymore. Being able to change my From: line would help, but I can see
where it would also open up opportunity for forgeries.

Any suggestions (aside from getting to a human managing the listserv)
would be helpful.

Lets see if the .sig, and the From: bear any resemblance this week.

 I just noticed an interesting 'feature' in Pine 3.91.

If you have marked a message in your INBOX for deletion, but decide
to save it to a folder instead, the saved message is tagged for
deletion there too.

If you have big folders (as I often do), you may not notice that there
are one too many deletion tags, and ZAP, you've just nuked a message
you actually wanted to keep.

I don't know about you, but if I've saved something to a folder, I generally
did so because I wanted to KEEP it, not delete it.

Please fix this in 3.92 (trivial I'm sure).

This is not "Bad News", but a *feature* (no smiley), the most important
one in 8.7 in my personal opinion. It will finally allow us to use 8-bit
characters in a standards-compliant way, without resorting to Quoted-
Printable, among those who announce their capability to do so - i.e.
*without* sending 8-bit characters to other systems, that may bit-strip
or even flat out refuse to accept them (there are systems of both
varietes out there, and they're all perfectly within their rights to do
what they do).

Let's *not* - the F=8 flag is intented for use in local environments,
where not all of your MTA's may be upgraded to announce 8BITMIME, but
you nevertheless are sure (by means of some out-of-bands information/
agreement/directive) that they are capable of handling 8-bit mail.

I.e. it should never be used for a mailer that sends to the Internet in
general (and even *.se is "general" in this respect) - it is of course
possible to use it for specific destinations with whom you have
agreements to that effect, if you are prepared to accept the
administrative burden of keeping track of this. A simpler solution is of
course to suggest to those that are bothered by receiving Q-P that they
upgrade to an MTA that is capable of announcing 8BITMIME support - such
as sendmail 8.7.x.

Subject: can Quoted-Printable encoding be forced?

X-Status: 

I correspond in Hebrew here and there. One system that I correspond
with, however, seems unable to decode BASE64, which is what my text
goes as (unless it has only a VEry few 8 bit code characters).
I don't know if it will work if I can encode as Q-P
(which is what *all* their stuff comes in when it gets to me)
but I sure would like to try.
any suggestions?

by the way,
I don't want to name their system here, but the support staff at
that ISP do not seem to be very helpful so far, unfortunately.
I know that eventually that system has to put its house in order
in various ways, but it would also be helpful to find out if those
of us in the normal internet world can control our output in order
to communicate with systems that may be using something like a 
restricted/proprietary standard. And, situations where the recipient
may be able to deal with one kind of encoding and not another might
not be that rare (?)

try to put this in your .forward file:
\username, new@address.host

This would save each mail in username's mailbox, and forward a copy 
to the new address.
If you forget the \, the mail will then be forwarded to yourself, 
again and again, not just saved in your mailbox.
You could also use more adresses to forward the mail, just
remember to seperate them with comma.

Is it possible to define macros for Pine 3.90 ?  For example, could I
press the Rubout key instead of Ctrl-D.  I have noticed that PgDn and PgUp
work already, so I tought that it could be done for end-of-line (Ctrl-E),
beg-of-line (Ctrl-A), rubout (Ctrl-D), insert (Ctrl-U), etc .. 

Thanks, Christian

WinBiff 3.1 is an email notifier for Windows that works with
Pegasus Mail, Eudora, MS-Mail, cc:Mail, and other mail agents.
WinBiff works as a POP3 and IMAP client using WinSock.

New stuff:  cc:Mail and IMAP support

WinBiff is shareware.

None, if all You intend to do is to write E-Mail's.
And most of the time I read USENET News with Pine 3.91 8bit (a patched
version), because it's faster. And I get a logg of replies etc.

But there is one thing Netscape is better at!
It arranges threads using indentation for every level:

    Don't bet the farm on this, because I have not actually examined the 
Pine source code to see precisely what it is doing, but under 
Unix(-like), I think it just makes numeric range entries of messages you 
don't want to see by number in the .newsrc file.  There is only one entry 
per newsgroup, and if you keep the messages disposed of contiguous, a 
.newsrc entry changes very little in size over time.

True, but that's more or less the perfect usage for the IMAP protocol. 
The mailboxes and mail filter is located on the server while your general 
UA runs on the client and grabs the mails off the different folders from 
the server, configures the filter on the server etc. To do this, the user 
doesn't even need a shell account (i.e. if the CMU cyrus imapd is used).
IMAP already provides access to multiple mailboxes and also allows to 
store mail messages into a remote mailbox. This is definitely way-to-go 
for the future...

Cheers,
Jochen

We would like to change our user's default system mail box to
/var/spool/mail/$USER/$USER instead of /var/spool/mail/$USER.

For other MUAs (elm, mailx/Mail), I can simply setenv 
MAIL=/var/mail/$USER/$USER in the startup script.

How can I tell PINE where the new system mail box is without having to ask 
everyone of our users to do it in .pinerc (inbox-path)?

Thanks in advance.

Is it possible to import to the pine adress book from a plain

Hi there,

I'm just beginning using pine as a better (?) mailer than elm. It has 
some advantadges but I miss in pine one think I like very much in elm:

How can I pipe the contents of a folder, or a message being read, or a 
message being composed to some commmand?

Elm gives me the possibility of editing a whole folder, this is fine to 
look for and find some piece of info.

In Elm I use to pipe a message through some filter in case, for exemple, 
it has a diferent character encoding (and is not a mime compliant one) or 
to pipe a message or a whole folder to a printing program such as a2ps.

Sometimes I get a message with a uuencoded piece of it, I just pipe it to 
uudecode and I have the binary exctracted.

Is it posible to do this kind of tricks from pine? Is it possible to 
switch to a shell from pine (this is useful when connected from a dumb 
terminal.


Thank you,


Frederic Udina

(In Pine 3.91)

Pine claims, in the help files, that the TAB key on the folder index screen
may be used to scan the folders for recent messages.  Unfortunately, it seems
to think that if I look at a folder's index, the folder's messages are no
longer recent, even if I didn't actually try to read any of the messages.
Is there any way to change this behavior so that it checks for messages that
I have never read rather than messages I have never seen indexed?

Adding headers that can be changed is done with default-composer-hdrs and
adding fixed headers is with customized-hdrs, both in the .pinerc file.

There are reasons that you may legitimately want to change the From.  For
example, if you are temporarily borrowing some other user's task, or if
you have multiple persona and need to have the email be from one even if
you're temporarily logged in as the other.  [For example, I regularly send
responses as my UW persona from my commercial account.]

Whether or not Pine permits it is governed by a build-time option in 3.91
that determines whether or not From is on a list of "forbidden to change"
headers.

If you change your From in Pine, Pine will automatically include a Sender
(or X-Sender, depending upon if configuration is worried about LISTSERV
brain damage) that gives your actual credentials.  So it isn't "forged
mail" or rather its "forged but here's who it really is".

You can also change your Reply-To in any recent version of Pine.

To summarize:
	From		who I claim it is From
	Sender		who the program says it is really From
	X-Sender	alternate to Sender for sites worried about LISTSERV
	Reply-To	where I want replies to go
	Return-Path	where error reports about undelivery of the
			 message should go (may be null, meaning "just
			 toss it")

  It would be nice if pine broke lines not keeping alone `.' on a line and
putting soft line break after `From' (so the space will be at the
beginning of the next line; this seems better to me than replacing `F' by
=46).

  Just a suggestion ...

Assuming you are using Pine 3.91 you must first enable the pipe command 
(not available by default to reduce information overload to new users).  
You do this by going to Pine's Main Menu and typing S (setup) then C 
(configuration).  Look down for and select the "enable-unix-pipe-cmd" 
item.  Leave the screen by typing E (exit).

When reading a message you can pipe it into something just by typing "|".

To pipe a number of messages (including all in the current) folder first 
use the Select command (;) to choose the messages you wish to operate on, 
followed by the Apply (A) command.  For example,
	;	... Select
	A	... All messages in current folder
	A	... Apply
	|	... Pipe command to them

The Select and Apply commands, along with the associated Zoom command, 
also need to be enabled in the Setup Conifugration Screen.  Turn on the 
"enable-aggregate-command-set" item.

I don't believe it is directly possible to pipe a message you are 
composing into something, other than by defining the something an the 
"alternate-editor", and then using the Composer's "Alt Edit" command.

> Elm gives me the possibility of editing a whole folder, this is fine to 
> look for and find some piece of info.

With Pine:

When READING a message "W" (WhereIs) searches for a particular string 
within the current message.

At the FOLDER INDEX list "W" (WhereIs) searches the displayed text 
(From/Date/Subject) for the string and moves to that message.

At the FOLDER INDEX the Select (;) command can (when enabled) be used to 
select messages based on a number of criteria (Date, Sender, Subject 
string, string in message body, etc).  Having selected some messages they 
can then be operated on using the Apply command as described above, or 
summaried (unselected messages hidden from the list) using the Z (zoom) 
command.  A second Z (zoom) command restores the full list without 
cancelling the selection.  Thus,
	;	... Select
	T	... Text
	A	... All message text
	widget	... string "widget"
	Z	... hide unselected messages from list

If invoked with the "-z" option (ie, "pine -z") then the "suspend" 
feature of Pine is enabled.  Assuming your shell supports job control, 
that is.  You can then ^Z to suspend Pine, and later "fg" to get back in 
to it.

I'm replying to myself again (we are disconnected from the news and I 
don't know if somebody else has replied it, or even if somebody else has 
read my question!)

I've been able to import the aliases.text generated by elm alias software 
by simply changing ' = ' to TAB 
and adding the resulting lines to my .addessbook file. Pine has done the 
rest.

Now my next question: is there a Pine for Macintosh?

I use this feature regularly, and it works as documented: it jumps 
through to the next new (unread) message.  That is, the next message 
shown with an "N" status at the start of its line in the index listing.

This can also be useful within newsgroups, especially as it offers to 
continue the scan through the next subscribed newsgroup if no more New 
(recent) articles are found in the current newsgroup.

Why it isn't working for you I'm not sure... check that the index screen 
is indeed showing the messages with an "N" status.

These features are common to all the programs based on the same idea as 
popclient: to separate mail retrieving (handled by popclient or a relative) 
and mail displaying, editing, etc, handled directly from the local mail 
spool by a mailer like exmh, elm, or else. Here is the (complete?) list of 
"batch" POP clients on Unix:

"popclient" <ftp://ftp.mal.com/pub/pop> but Archie will find many places

"popc" <ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/Linux/net>

"popmail" <ftp://ftp.cic.net/pub/Software/unix/mail>

and the one I prefer :-)

"gwpop" <ftp://ftp.pasteur.fr/pub/Network/gwpop>


What are the differences? Well, if someone could test them all and post the
results, it would be great...

You can turn the feature on - meaning users can toggle full headers on - 
by setting "enable-full-header-cmd" in the "feature-list" section of 
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  This won't automatically display full headers, 
just give them the option of turning them on for that session.

Wow. That must be really cool. I wonder why nobody else ever thought of 
that. Bill Gates must really be a genius.

I also love it when Exchange assumes that the Sender: line overrides the 
From: line, when it puts names in redundant single quotes, when it gets 
creative with the quoted/printable format, and when it gives me that cool 
WINMAIL.DAT RTF attachment.

Thats good.

Can we also get a move cursor by word left (^\) and one to jump to next 
punctuation (like a . or ,)(^]) if you haven't already done so.
I don't remember these as being 'special' ASCII codes like ^S^Q.

Thanks for the earlier reply.

I have two related questions.  Both probably involve modifying source
and would like to know if others have already done this.

Pine appears to get its information from getpwuid (or something similar).
The problem is that my "From" line should read like my "Reply-to" above.
While I can easily use "Reply-To", I am not sure that I can teach
all our users here to do the same.

So, what I would like to do is get the "Real Name" from the GCOS field
(as is done now), but get the username part of the address from another
source (I know where that source will be).

Is this the right way to go about things?  Has anyone else done
something similar?

The second related question is that I want message to me specifically
to be marked with a "+", and that should include message to
"J.Goldberg@cranfield.ac.uk" and not just the few that are to
"cc047@Cranfield.ac.uk".  This is a similar problem.  Chances are, this
isn't a difficult modification at all, but what really would be nice
if there were a configuration option for "alternate-names" or something
like that.

I think I can clarify the problem:

 *Within* a folder, TAB stops at the next msg marked with an "N" or "*".
 Going *between* incoming folders, TAB only stops if there is a RECENT
 message in the incoming folder being tested.  At the moment there is
 no way to cause TABbing to the next folder to stop if there are unread,
 but no longer recent, messages.

make sure your /tmp directory has the following permissions:

drwxrwxrwt	3	root	root	1024	Oct 16 10:50	tmp/

(this is what it should look like if you go to main root directory and "ls -al"
at prompt...

nothing mentions the font. Any ideas?

I was wondering if anyone knew how to set up pine to spawn
ghostview to read a postscript attachment.  It should work
the same way it does when the attachemnt is a gif or tiff file
and it spawns the image-viewer defined in .pinerc but there is
not a variable in .pinerc for postscript files.

thanks in advance,

Why, when Pine can already retrieve POP3 mail directly?

Hi... in the next few weeks I am going to be setting up a simple email 
system for my high school, and we have pretty much decided on using pine 
as each user's shell (so they get their mail by telnet... they don't have 
to mess with sh or bash because they can do all the other internet stuff 
with netscape/fetch/newswatcher on the macs)

I am trying to set it up so that they won't have to know the difference 
that they are running pine on a  remote machine (these people aren't the 
most ocmputer literate!)

Its simple to set it up so they print to local printers 
(attached-to-ansi) and I have tested it with the specific telnet client 
(the newest version of NCSA telnet for mac).  

On my unix account, the 'E' command exports the mail to a file on the 
unix host.  On my teacher's, it prompts you for a file name, and 
initiates some sort of file transfer!  I have read the FAQ, and the 
tech-notes document, and I can't figure out how to do this.  I thought 
I'd ask here before wading through the source to figure it out.

Thanks a lot,
Scott

How do I get color text into pine?  I seen it once before, but this person

I've read every document on Pine's WWW pages at Washington, all documents 
that came with the PC-Pine Windows version, and still am unable to 
determine how to configure PC-Pine for use with my remote account.

My confusion... If I'm not mistaken, shouldn't a user of PC-Pine be 
prompted for a password if accessing a remote folder/collection?  I 
believe PC-Pine allows for a file called PINE.PWD... does this file 
contain these passwords?  If so, how does one get the password (supposed 
to be encripted per FAQ) into the file?  My attempts to run PC-Pine have 
not resulted in any prompts for a password.

I believe I have the configuration correct to access the remote 
folders... however, everytime I try, I get an error.  I believe because I 
need the password, somehow, someway.

Any help appreciated.  TIA

Save it first, before you delete it from your inbox.  Pine will (unless

designated folder AND delete it from your inbox!

: Please fix this in 3.92 (trivial I'm sure).

Repeat ... (s)ave it first .. it should be saved to your chosen folder 
AND deleted from your inbox.  Hope this helps!

    Maybe -- it depends on the receiving system.  Go into Setup/Config 
and create a custom header  Return-Receipt-To: your-email-address 
When you send mail, some receiving systems will honor this and send you 
back a return receipt, and some will not.  Although I have not tried it, 
I strongly suspect that CompuServe will probably _not_ honor it.  There 
is no requirement in the Internet standards that a receiving system do 
so, so it is sort of pot luck.  By the way, the return receipt does NOT 
mean that the recipient has read it -- it only means that it got there.

If you want to disable it then make sure in your pine configuration

	default-fcc = <Empty Value>

i.e., when you setup your configuration and change its value, ONLY enter a 
blank space.

Of course, you can give it any folder name you like.  Hope this helps...

Yah know, it would *really* be helpful if you mention *exactly* what error
you get.  I'm guessing it's a "connection refused" which means the server
doesn't support IMAP, but only you have the crucial info to know for sure.

 If you are running X, there is a utility called tkpostage you could use.
 Its a replacement for xbiff, and normally shows how many messages you have
 waiting. When you click on the icon, it lists all the headers.

Run Pine with an initial keystroke of "i" to get you into the INDEX on

	You may not want to turn off encoding of PostScript files.  The
reason is many PostScript files will have lines which are greater than
1000 characters in length.  These long lines tend to get "folded" in
transit.  Also, PostScript files can contain more than 7bit ASCII.

	I'm getting some strange behavior from pine and was wondering if 
anyone had a clue as to why.  This may be more of a unix thing than a pine 
thing, but here it goes anyway.

	I have this snippet of code in my .profile:
(This is running on a SparcServer 1000 w/ Solaris 2.2, charget is a small 
executable that gets a single character from stdin and echoes it to stdout)

if [[ -s /usr/mail/$LOGNAME ]]; then
        print
        from
        print
        print "Read mail now?"
        if [[ $(charget) = y ]] ; then
                pine -i
        fi
fi

	The wierd behavior is that if I suspend pine when this code runs it, I 
end up nowhere (ie no shell).  There is nothing I can do from that point but 
kill the telnet session, then log back in and kill the process (it locks my 
mail folder).  When I kill the process it goes <defunct> and stays there.
	If I suspend pine after running it from the command line, everything 
is fine, I end up in ksh.  Why is this happening, and is there anything I can 
do to make pine suspendable from the .profile startup.  I tried putting 'ksh 
pine -i' in place of 'pine -i', but then it wouldn't run at all.

TIA

Hi,

	I just noticed a minor problem with pine.  Pine does not check
permissions on a file at the time you enter it as an attachment.  It
only notices it at the time of sending and then it sends the message
sans attachment.

	Regards,
		Ed

P.S.	That's pine 3.91 BTW....

see the messages posted.  I am unable to do this in pine.  I cant even see what
news groups are out there to post on.  I cant even find this news group on the
other computer using pine.  How do I set up pine to allow me access.  I am very
new to this program so please make it simple.  How do I do the setup
configuration? How do I setup the index folder for news groups? 
Also, how do I remove deleted e-mail without quitting pine? All ideas and

	   news directory as it does when I post with Pnews.  Can

	2. Assuming posting from pine works, how do you restrict the

	Any help will be appreciated.

Hi, I'm trying to use PC-pine over a PPP connection.  I'm using the DOS 
based version and am running into a few problems.  First of all, the 
network I'm trying to run it on does not have an Imap server installed.  
If I want to send one to the system administrator to be installed, which 
one would I use for BSDI unix?  I looked through the archive at 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in directory /pine/unix-bin-compressed, and I 
didn't see an Imap program for bsdi.  Also, is there any way possible to 
run pine over a pop3 server?  If so, I'd appreciate knowing how.  Lastly, 
is Imap pretty easy to install?  If anyone can answer these questions for 
me, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thanks a bunch.

I've got a .maildelivery set up to append messages to already existing
folders in pine -- things in my ~hfreder/Mail directory -- and I want pine
to be intelligent and realise that some of the folders in that directory
are indeed incoming message folders.  I tried enabling multiple incoming
folders, yippee, and then 'a'dding in a new incoming folder specifying, well,
near as I can bloody tell, an already existing folder.  Now I've got an 
incoming folder that I can't delete because it doesn't exist as far as pine
can tell, and on top of it I'm no closer to having one of my already existing
folders specified as an incoming folder.

Solutions to both of the above implied problems would be greatly appreciated.
Email is likely to get to me faster than posting to this group, but a message
delivered in either fashion would be much appreciated.

Thanks.

Hi,

I use imapcopy with imap3.6beta and have a little problem. If I copy/move 
my mailbox to my local machine all new articles are no longer new -> they 
are marked as read. How can I prevent this?

TIA,
  Ronald.

perhaps  you need to allow 'others' and 'group' users to read the file.
Try typing
chmod og+r .plan
at the unix prompt while staying in your home directory.

Is it possible to adjust the sampling time for new mail pine uses?
I will like it to react faster to mail arrival because I use 'newmail'
to announce me arrival of new mail, and pine does'nt react to the event
until several seconds later.

Alternatively, is there some pine command to force pine to look for new 
mail? This could solve my problem too, because I know that there is new 
mail. In elm, I type '$' and elm is forced to re-read the inbox file.

Thanks,


Frederic Udina

Any ideas? HELP!

	Use a "ctrl-l".  It is equivalent to the $ in elm in that respect...

I am having a problem with pine and large distribution lists. I want to 
create a distribution list of over 90 addresses (perhaps this problem is 
tied in with the bcc problem in another thread). 

I first tries one big list - then I broke the list up into parts and 
tried to create a "super" list with the aliases of the smaller lists. Still 
no dice. Its like pine just won't mail to all 90 people at once.

Anyone got any ideas (soes this group have a FAQ).

For Unix Pine there are a number of tools, all relaying on pine's ability
to call an alternative editor.  I use an outdated version of mkpgp
which you can find out more about by sending mail to:

deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu

with the subject "send mkpgp"  (I think that that is it).

There are other tools, one is called BAP (Bryce's Auto PGP), and there
is something else called autopgp, and yet another tool called editppg

I don't have addresses for all of these, but I would suggest that if
you have access to ftp or the WWW, try

 ftp ftp.pgp.net
or
 http://www.pgp.net/pgp

Many of these tools are available from those sites.

You can also get Email help and PGP FAQs by sending mail with the
subject "HELP PGP" (without the quotes) to galactus@stack.urc.tue.nl

If anyone from the pgp group (which you may not get at your site) has
further details about other tools or where to get this, I hereby encourage 
them to also send you (aaron@irdu.nus.sg) mail directly.

I don't know whether pine is able to read mail from stdin as ELM does.
If so, you slightly can do something like

uuencode <File> <File> | elm -s "Binary mail" <recipient>

(Sorry, I don't know the syntax for pine options in batch mode.)

So long,

While in the "INBOX" folder, enter 'X' and Pine will show any new mail, 
as well as expunge any mail you have marked to delete.

There are some fixed size buffers in some versions of sendmail that you're
probably running into.  It will probably work better if you set your
smtp-server configuration variable to the name of an smtp-server and use
that method of delivery instead.  You might start out by trying
smtp-server=localhost.

This probably comes when your pine attempts to create a
.globaladdressbook.lu file in the directory where .globaladdressbook is
located.  If you don't have permission to do that, it will try in /tmp,
but if that is a different file system, you'd get the cross-device link
problem.  If that addressbook is supposed to be globally available,
someone with the necessary permissions should create the
.globaladdressbook.lu file.  They could do that by listing
.globaladdressbook as one of their regular personal address books and then
accessing it (or use the -create_lu command line option).  It could also
be the case that the .lu file already exists but you don't have permission
to read it.  In that case, the permissions need to be fixed.  Thanks.

For the incoming deletion problem, quit pine, and edit .pinerc by hand.
You'll see where to edit.

Pine by default does NOT reference incoming folders to your ~/mail/
directory, but refers to them starting from your home directory.  So if
you want the foo folder to be an incoming folder, specify it as
~/mail/foo

The problem is that 'almost'.

It takes a minimum of 2 keystrokes. Plus the movement commands.  Being
abnormally fumble figered, getting a three finger process going is a lot
more difficult than a two finger one.  

I use tin as my news reader, and dearly wish that pine would use tin key
commands.  e.g. T for tag.  However keybindings can be a semi-religious
issue. Eventually, perhaps keymaps so that you can roll your own.

Yes, I quickly discovered that, but it still doesn't provide the 
functionality I need.  I want to be able to use the browser directly from 
a script to be able to indicate files and pass them off to the script for 
processing.  My goal is to be able to ask the user

	What file do you want to do whatever to?

And if they don't know, they would have an option to go to the browser to 
select the file.

What should be the correct permissions on the PINE global address book 
and associated files?  Our setup is the following:

        rwxr--r--  root   users    globaladdressbook
        rw-rw----  root   system   globaladdressbook.lu

Is this correct?

If you use filter then I guess elm is there as well? If thats so then
the elm facility 'frm' is available to you, and you can point it at
alternative folders.

Matt,
There are several solutions coming down the pike, but probably none
exactly meeting your needs today --unless the destination computer you're
referring to is running Unix.

I am trying to run Pine on Wyse-50 terminals.  The only problem I'm

Is there a way to reprogram the arrow keys on the terminal to what pine 
expects?  I've looked in the Wyse-50 manual and coming up blank.

Is anyone else using Wyse-50s?

I'm running Pine 3.91 on SVR4, using NCSA Telnet on a Macintosh.

When I set my terminal to a large size (stty rows 50 columns 120) the
Pine composer starts acting funny. The screen will draw, then the screen
will shift up one whole line. Thus, when I compose, it looks like I'm typing
on the cc: line when I'm actually typing on the to: line. Needless to say,
this is quite frustrating. Any suggestions?

People with read access to the addressbook file also benefit from having 
read access to the associated lookup (.lu) file, so set the ownership 
and/or protections accordingly.

If you don't then every time someone starts Pine it builds a private copy 
of the lookup file in your tmp directory!

As I mentioned once before, I have written a Perl script that provides 
similar functionality to Elm's "frm" script but (I hope) is rather more 
reliable at counting messages and has a slightly pretty display.

It can be used on a particular folder if a path to the folder is given
(eg, /var/mail/xyz1 or ./pine-info-list), otherwise it treats its argument
as a username to check the mail folder for in the mail directory (useful 
for Super-Users!).

You can find out more, and get the software, from

	http://www.york.ac.uk/ftparchive/unix/messages/

Cheers,

	for file in $folders
	do
		scan -format formatstring -file $file
	done

	If you have mh.  This would seem to solve the problem very well.  If
you use mh then something like this might be better

	folder -push
	for file in $folders
	do
		scan -format formatstring +$folder
	done
	folder -pop

Of course this will take forever...  Procmail users might dump headers
to a file and then look at that.

Hi!

Start an editor (i. e. pico), read the file .newsrc and delete all lines 
(groups) you don't want to subscribe (don't forget the backup that file) 
and save the .newsrc after changing

OR

use the 'D'-Command (unsubscribe) in the pine-folder-list.

Now you have a shorter Grouplist.

hopoe ist helps, for more questions e-mail me.

Me.

Except that I managed 
- to crash the Windows version a few times 
  (e.g. when doing a few window resizes) 
- or had it stumble into an infinite loop and create a "sent" file as large 
  as   disk space allowed for a message just a few lines long.

Well, and then it's a bit strange using a version calling itself "beta" for 
some 12 (twelve) months now...

Yeah, and it's going to be even stranger when we call the new version a
"beta" since it has 12 months of changes in it... :)

Or, if you -do- use use procmail, then the mailstat script that 
accompanies it may be useful:

Well, since I'm getting a few requests like this, I'll respond to the 
list as well.

It's where you simply translate each character of the alphabet by thirteen
positions (rotate by 13). Since there are 26 characters in this particular
alphabet, rotating by thirteen characters is half of the alphabet. This
gives the appearance of an encoded message (scrambled). It's commonly used
as a matter of courtesy on some news groups on bits of text that the
author feels may offend some readers.  Those readers (recipients) who care
to risk viewing something potentially offending may ``rot13'' the text. 
The letter 'a' becomes 'n', 'b' becomes 'o', and so on. 

A highly offensive statement to some:

    This is fine provided all of your incoming mail is in your INBOX 
(i.e., still in the mail spool).  However, I, like _many_ people, use a 
utility such as procmail (or filter) to pre-sort mail into various 
folders before I ever invoke my mail reader (Pine, in my case).  I have 
been wanting a utility (Perl OK) that would list the headers of mail not 
only remaining in the INBOX but also in pre-sorted folders.

	I use tin for posting, but it has the same feature.  Actually, I
choose to take the question seriously ("do you *really* want to post?")
every time I see it.  I don't think it hurts to give one last
consideration.  There have been times, in fact, when after considering for
a moment, I actually said "no, you're right, I *don't* want to post this." 
In this life, and *certainly* on usenet, it's far too easy to make an ass
of oneself.  

	I'm grateful for this feature.  I often wish others would take a
moment to give the question serious consideration rather than just
skipping past it.  Who knows, there may come a day when it saves *your*
neck, or at least your good name. 

	If you know about dejanews, you know that whatever you post 
certainly does *not* forever go away after a few days.  Dejanews is a 
sobering site to visit.  I recommend it to all who find the "do you 
*really* want to post" question an irritation.

One thing you might try is SortIndex by Ordered Subject: $O
Then at least the messages in the pseudo-thread will be grouped together,
so you can just hold down the "D" key for awhile :)

Recently switched from Elm to Pine because Elm saves a copy of a message 
before deleting it.  This causes problem when disk allocation is nearly 
used up.

 I changed for that reason only, but generaly I like pine better.  I find it
somewhat easier to navigate etc.


Following features of Pine are somewhat annoying.  Would be nice if you 
could improve them in future versions of pine.  I'm using pine 3.91 on a 
unix system at OIT at UMass.

  "function keys" listed at the bottom of page are not always consistent for
different windows of pine.  e.g. ^T does different things in different 
places.  This is even more difficult because the editor also has still 
different uses of these keys.

  We can sort folder listing on-line,  but address list can be displayed 
in a different sorting only in some control file commands before opening 
pine.

  Address list can not import data from another ascii file,  e.g. the 
aliases from ELM.

  Address list can not be edited with a simple ascii text editor or word 
processor.

  

Please let me know if there is a newer better version available.  do I 
have to get the main-frame system administrator to get it for me or can I 
use my own local version?

 Thanks.  Claude Penchina

Dear Pine Experts,

Could you tell me whether I should "Reply to all Recipients" when I am 
simply replying to a message that has come to me via a mailing list? My 
hunch is that should not.

Thanks for you help,

When I go into Pine and default into the Main Menu there is no item that

This makes it rather difficult to manuver around. On my friends server 
same version of Pine 3.90 he is able to see an item high lighted and goes 
from there. I tried looking at Setup and Configure but with no luck. Any 
help would be appreciated.

I am just wondering whether there is a command in PINE that has the function
of getting directly to the bottom of the mesg list like "*" does in ELM?

Thanks.

1.  Your sysadmin will need to get the source and recompile.  Not a big
deal for most machines. Source is freely available.

2.  Pine doesn't do POP.  Good explaination on the www server about the
differences between IMAP and POP.  I agree with the developers choice.

3.  Installing it is not rocket science.

Yes, and it is the same command as is used to get to the bottom of a 
message when you are composing it:

	^W ^V

And to get to the top is:

	^W ^Y

I am using a Hewlett Packard OmniBook 4000CT and am unable to use my 
arrow keys in the Pine Program.

I am not a techie, but did get some help from one, who verified this 
problem for me - that it is in fact the computer keyboard that is not 
cooperating, not my ignorance, causing me to be completely unable to 
navigate.
If I use the up arrow key the screen freezes, with the bottom white bar 
on this screen noting that the up arrow has been activated.  I can press 
escape to get back to an active screen

My Expert advisor was able to determine for me that the Function keys ie 
F7 is cursor up, F8 is down, BUT, these keys are not working for me in Pine.

What should I do?

I assume the solution needs to involve an exchange of information at a 
technical level, with Pine programers and HewLett Packard people doing 
the talking.

Please Help!

I have a question:

When creating a multiple address list, is it possible to hide all the 
addresses?  For example, when I send a message to everyone 
in my department, I have an address set up so that I just type "ref" in 
the "TO:" slot.  However, it is cumbersome for others to read the mail 
because the first page is full of all the addresses that the mail is 
being sent to.  Is there anyway to hide these addresses?

I would like to use Japanese on Pine, but Japanese character includes

aww, rubbish the answer is
giftoppm $* | ppmscale -xsize 80 | pnminvert | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm | pbmtoascii

assuming you have the right tools.

Works fine for me to view gifs on my vt100.

To download files, you might try something along the lines of setting 
your default printer on your pc to be to output to a file, (no idea if 
this is possible on a pc) and then set your pine printer option on the 
unix box to be 1) attached-to-ansi then "print" the files you wish to save.

Otherwise Export and then ftp.

It had something to do with counting the msg length incorrectly for
certain kinds of messages (maybe ones with nulls?  I don't remember now).

if you use procmail take a look at the program 'mailstat' that comes
with it: it shows how you mail was sorted (and if you read the plain
file created by mailstat it also shows the headers).

I assume that you have been resizing the telnet screen to 50x120
but that the terminal you are running pine on does not know that
the terminal you view it on has that size.
Better leave the terminal at the size when you started pine and
not do any resize.

If you however always use a 50x120 terminal with NCSATelnet [*]
then you should set the terminal size before you call pine:
	stty rows 50 colums 120

Not all "stty" programs know this.  So you might need to set env vars
"LINES" and "COLUMNS".  It all depends on your system.  :-)

[*]  Which version?  I think 2.7b4 was the last I used.

Highlighting depends on the features of both program and terminal.
For help on terminals configuration you should get help locally.

Not true!  If you use "s" to save then, yes, it saves a copy.
However, you can use "d" to mark the current message for deletion.

Aw, come on!  You cannot expect a format conversion of every format there is
with every program you might use.  Use a script for conversion!

    Procmail is a mail pre-processing package written and supported by 
Stephen van der Berg (sp?) that runs under Unix and Unix-like systems.  
It can do many things with mail after it is delivered and before it is 
processed by a mail-user agent (pine, elm, whatever).  Many people use 
procmail to sort incoming mail into various separate folders (such as 
mailing list mail each into their own), although procmail will do much 
more than this.  To do much more than simple mail filtering, it seems to 
be assumed that the user knows a lot about Unix.

Sure, put the "multiple address list" onto the Bcc: line.
Then everyone will get a copy, but not see other addresses.

As a mail needs an adress in the "To:" list, too, put yourself there.
Or just "root".  ;-)

The normal behavior of pine on my SunOS system is that if multiple pine
sessions open the same inbox, the last to open it gets the folder lock.

How can I change this behavior so that the first session holds the folder
lock and future sessions get read-only?  I couldn't find anything in the FAQ.

How do you get a mac with telnet to be able to set a mark,
which currently maps to a CTRL caret. Our macs seem not to be able to send
control codes from numeric keys this way.

I'm initially remapped this to a CTRL Delete, but the problem with this is
that the people used to the old way on other machines now won't be able to
make it work, and I don't particularly want to rewrite the code to do it
both ways. 

What are other sites with macs doing?

Years ago Pine and imapd did what you want, but we got lots of complaints
from people who's PC had wedged and they powered off, leaving a hung pine
or imapd for awhile holding the lock.  So we changed to "last one wins".

The preferred way to solve the problem is to switch to Tenex format, which
allows all sessions to have R/W access (except expunging can only be done
when there is a single client).  If Tenex format is not an option because
of legacy mailer access requirements, hacking the c-client source would be
necessary.

I'm using the version 3.91 and have some difficulties.
Hardware is HP 730 running HP-UX 9.05

When composing mail some letters give the message unknown command,
but others print ok. When using standalone pico, no such things happen.

Im using plain vanilla (HP) vt100 terminal emulation.

What can I change in configuration files or compiling options
to stop this irritating behaviour?

This is the old behavior, and it got changed because people complained
about it (e.g. they left a Pine logged in at the office and found that
they couldn't get read-write when they logged in from home).

If you really want the old behavior, look for code which looks like this
in pine3.91/imap/c-client/bezerk.c and pine3.91/imap/c-client/mmdf.c

				/* can get the lock? */
    else if (flock (fd,LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)) {
      if (retry-- == KODRETRY) {/* no, first time through? */
				/* yes, get other process' PID */
	if (!fstat (fd,&sbuf) && (i = min (sbuf.st_size,MAILTMPLEN)) &&
	    (read (fd,tmp,i) == i) && !(tmp[i] = 0) && (i = atol (tmp))) {
	  kill ((int) i,SIGUSR2);
	  sprintf (tmp,"Trying to get mailbox lock from process %ld",i);
	  mm_log (tmp,WARN);
	}
	else retry = 0;		/* give up */
      }

Greeting from Portland, Oregon.

I have a pine question I have not been able to get an answer to.  I have a pine 
folder with a couple of hundred messages that I want to send the same broadcast 
e-mail message to.  The Address Book is too much work for this one shot broadcast 
message thing, and I don't want to use macros via my communications program.  Too 
slow.

Any ideas?   Thanks.

Hello,

By default, Pine uses MIME (Quote-Printable) (and I even got base64 a few
times) to post 8-bit news. 

MIME is useful in mails as many SMTP servers doesn't do 8-bit. However,
most NNTP can do 8-bit while many popular news readers like tin can't do
MIME. This is important for Chinese posting. People who read news with tin
can't read my Chinese postings from Pine. 

Is there any method to make Pine 3.91 to post with 8-bit directly?

Thanks.

Regards,
Davy

I'm using pine 3.91 under NextSTep and HP-UX. I've got my default editor
set to vi.  A couple minor agravations.

1.  If my file carbon copy is set to name, and I reject the fcc when I
suddently realize that I'm about to make yet another folder, pine throws
me back in the editor.  I think that instead it should leave me on the
fcc line, to change/delete it, or optionally abort the fcc. (Another
config item?)

2.  Both in PICO and in Pine, when the reply is quoted, the blank lines
are quoted too.  This means that delete paragraph in vi zaps the entire
message.  Please, can pine do some formating of the message and stuff a
blank line between paragraphs when quoting.  

3.  At present for a list I can set a name for the fcc folder.  While I
don't really want a folder for each person I correspond with, I'd like
to have some automation here.  Could pine remember on a per name basis
where to put fcc's, at least for the one's in the address book.  

(E.g. I throw all my vendor correspondence into a folder called Vendors.
There are people on the strawbale mailing list that I want always fcc'd
to strawbale, instead of to bec2354. )


4. I'm using procmail to prefilter my mail and put the stuff from about
8 of the mailing lists I'm on into separate folders which I identify as
incomming folders for Pine.  That works great.  One of the folders has
about 300 messages in it.  I'd like to jsut keep them there -- I don't
really see a need to keep the incoming separate from the storage for
these guys.
	HOWEVER, pine takes a long time to check that it doesn't have
anything new in it.  I suspect that it's reading the whole damn thing to
find out if there's anything new.  Surely this could be done with a file
stat call to check the timestamp of the file.  (This may require Pine to
keep track of when it last read a given folder.)

Ok, flame away.

How about 
egrep '^From:' mailfoldername | sed -e 's-^From:--' | sort | uniq > list

That willgive you a list of all the people on the folder.  That list can
either be pasted into the address book by hand editing it outside of
pine, or you can do a cleaver xargs command with it.

Depends on how the list is set up, and the charter for it.

E.g. next-managers has a deliberate policy when you post a problem that
you reply to the poster only.  He sumarizes to the whole list.  This
keeps the volume very small.

On the strawbale list, we brainstorm a lot, and the convention is that
we reply to the list.

One thing I find aggravating however is people who reply all, then don't
notice that they are replying to the list, and cc'ing to the list.  If
the list server is slightly stupid, this results in everyone getting two
copies.  

So my answer would be, say yes, then look at the headers and check where
it's going.

Why sendmail not designed to decode QP to 8BIT when receiving a mail? If
this problem can be solved, mail can often stored as as-is and many
existing MUA can read 8-bit messages. I think the transition can be
smoother. Here in Hong Kong, we don't want to enable the QP flag of HP
sendmail since our major receiver of 8-bit mail do have 8-bit capable
sendmail mostly.

Subject: PINE hangs opening network INBOX
Message-Id: <DGsupu.Mz6@world.std.com>
Date: Sat, 21 Oct 1995 12:58:41 GMT
Status: O
X-Status: 

I use PINE for mail on my HP 735 running HP-UX 9.05.  I have a network mail 
server which is a DECstation running Ultrix 4.2a.  I mount the network mail
directory to /net/mail on by HP, but when I try to open my INBOX, PINE
hangs on opening.  I think it is a problem with mail locking and NFS
locking.  All of this has worked fine until recently, although I have heard
of problems like these.

If you can offer any help, please email to zach@world.std.com.  Thanks.

Thanks for responding. I have contacted my system administrator. That was 
the first thing I did when I couldn't figure out how to activate inverse text
or high lighting certain items when I went into Set up or Configure. I even
had my friend contact his sys admin as well since he uses another internet
provider and his version of Pine (same as mine) shows high lighted items. 
The problem is most of these people deal with SLIP accounts and have very 
little knowledge about the dial up text based shell accounts.

Davy,
"Just-send-8" violates Internet standards and is not supported by Pine,
notwithstanding the fact that a few folks have posted unsanctioned source
patches to make Pine violate the standard.

Pine 3.92 will support ESMTP negotiation of 8BITMIME, which is the
correct way of solving the problem in the Internet.

Having sendmail (or more likely, the delivery program, e.g. /bin/mail)
do QP and Base64 decoding seems like a good idea to me, but I don't know
of anyone who has done it.

On VMS MAIL, recovery of file space occurs automatically, in my experience:
on exit from VMS MAIL, it announces that it is recovering file space, there
is a delay, and then it exits.

When I use Yehavi's port of PINE to VMS, I feel sure that I have
seen the same message occasionally.  In any case, PINE uses exactly
the same folders as VMS MAIL, so if you were to go into MAIL instead
of PINE, you could do any tidying up that way.

Alternatively the problem could be with keeping too many "versions"
of old VAX/VMS files.  This has nothing to do with PINE as such.
If you do not require to keep old versions of VAX/VMS files, then
just issue "PURGE [...]" at the VMS command prompt.  Use DIR command
with /SIZE etc. options to review file space occupancy.  Again this
is all boring old VMS stuff that really has nothing to do with PINE.

Good luck

Okdokay .. thanks muchly, Terry. I had the user try to export the message
rather than save it to see if works that way. Haven't heard back from them
yet, but will let you know of the result. 

By "nailed in the development code" you mean the bug should be fixed in 
3.92? :)

Why sendmail not designed to decode QP to 8BIT when receiving a mail? If

Perhaps lack of time? (In code of sendmail 8.7 there is flag for that
with comment "not implemented"):

7TO8 (not implemtented):
conf.h:119:# ifndef MIME7TO8
conf.h:120:#  define MIME7TO8	1	/* 7->8 bit MIME conversions */
sendmail.h:368:#define MCIF_CVT7TO8	0x2000		/* convert from 7 to 8 bits */
8TO7 (implemented):
conf.c:219:#if MIME8TO7
conf.c:3597:#if MIME8TO7
conf.c:3598:	"MIME8TO7",
conf.h:115:# ifndef MIME8TO7
conf.h:116:#  define MIME8TO7	1	/* 8->7 bit MIME conversions */
deliver.c:1531:		mci->mci_flags |= MCIF_CVT8TO7;
deliver.c:1533:		mci->mci_flags &= ~MCIF_CVT8TO7;
deliver.c:2396:#if MIME8TO7
deliver.c:2397:	if (bitset(MCIF_CVT8TO7, mci->mci_flags))
headers.c:1140:		    bitset(MCIF_CVT8TO7|MCIF_INMIME, mci->mci_flags))
headers.c:1236:#if MIME8TO7
headers.c:1241:	    !bitset(MCIF_CVT8TO7, mci->mci_flags))
mime.c:59:#if MIME8TO7
mime.c:76:**  MIME8TO7 -- output 8 bit body in 7 bit format
readcf.c:1345:#if MIME8TO7
readcf.c:1592:#if MIME8TO7
sendmail.h:365:#define MCIF_CVT8TO7	0x0400		/* convert from 8 to 7 bits */
srvrsmtp.c:348:#if MIME8TO7
usersmtp.c:370:#if MIME8TO7
usersmtp.c:377:		mci->mci_flags |= MCIF_CVT8TO7;

this problem can be solved, mail can often stored as as-is and many
existing MUA can read 8-bit messages. I think the transition can be
smoother. Here in Hong Kong, we don't want to enable the QP flag of HP
sendmail since our major receiver of 8-bit mail do have 8-bit capable
sendmail mostly.

Hi,

Sometimes I have a message and I want to resend it or forward it to 
someone BUT I need to edit it before that.
In pine, If I 'f'orward the message, sometimes it put the old message as 
an attachment to the new, and so I can't edit it.

Is there some solution to it?

My experience has been that usually this just duplicates the mailing

Use this vi "macro" to clear all lines which only contain the "quote string":

	" 950101 ,D = "clear quoted empty lines"
	map	,D :g/^> *$/s/^.*$//

	NOTE:	You can put this into vi's startup file ($HOME/.exrc).
		"^M" has to be typed in with "control-v control-m".
		The '"' at the start of the line marks the line as a comment.
		Comments are *not* made with a has mark (#).

This assumes that "> " is the "quote string".

Of course you could let vi perform the command ",D" with every starup
but I do not recommend it.  Use it when appropriate!

    If you are using Pine 3.91, go into Setup/Config.  Under sort-key, 
set the sort order to OrderedSubj.  According to the help screen, this 
provides "pseudo threading."

The "just send 8 bits" philosophy is for use "between consenting
adults", so to speak.  When sender and recipient have prior agreement
about the character set being used, "just send 8 bits" is not only
acceptable, but also the most efficient and simple protocol.

The "just send 8 bits" strategy works just fine for email, since it's
always sent to a specific recipient.  It can work for Usenet News in
regional newsgroups, but is of course undesirable in Newsgroups with
global scope.

Clearly, misapplications can occur.  The "wrong-headed" label belongs
to a specific application of "just send 8 bits", not to the basic
strategy itself.

On the other hand, traditionally people have put pretty much anything
they wanted in their .signature.  So, "just send 8 bits" in the
.signature part of a Usenet posting should be happily tolerated - it's
not very different from some obscure quote or a puzzling ascii graphic.

I was playing around at the prompt and mistakenly changed something.
Now when I run pine I get a message that the folder inbox is 
unavailable.  What did I do wrong and how can I correct the problem.  I 
was playing around with mail.  I pressed q and the message said that 
messages were saved to /.mailbox/mbox.  Please help. Pine is effectively 
uselss.  I'm sure there is a quick fix but I don't know it.

Subject: Signature dashes?
Status: O
X-Status: 


I've just switched to using pine, and I can't figure out how to
turn on signature dashes.  Not good when using anonymous
remailers, since they expect standard sig formatting :-(
(If a .signature doesn't start with '-- 'the anonymizer won't
spot it as a .sig, since that's been standard .sig formatting
since at least Bnews.)

Is there a way to turn on sig dashes, or do I have to make a
separate .signature just for pine, with the dashes in the sig?

I didn't see any mention of this in the signature & finger FAQ,
even though it does show how to turn on the dashes in elm.

TIA

As a BIG5 user, I quite agree that pine seems to ignore 8 bit news sending
problem.  Even I turn to ISO-8859-1 and all relevant environmental variables 
to accept 8 bit.  Although I think tin is better than pine as a news program,
it is better to have any patch to fix this minor problem. 

TIA.

Hello all,

This is my first post. I am new to PC-Pine v3.91.

Is there any way to set the number of lines per page that Pine 
sends in the ANSI-PRINTER mode?

I am using Windows 3.1 and an HP 550c printer. The text prints OK
except that the HP does an auto LF just before Pine sends a LF.

Therefore I end up with lots of white space every other page!

Hope that someone has solved this and can pass along the info
to me.

Thanks,

Vince

hello:

i use pine for dos to read, sort, print, etc., my mail (*.mtx files stored
locally) when i'm not connected to my network (& network drivers not
loaded).  i can read my local folders just fine, but pine always opens
them *readonly* mode, which makes it difficult to manipulate email items
the way i'd like. 

does anyone know of a simple way to force pine to open local folders in
read/write mode, even when not connected to a host?  i've made lots of
changes to the pinerc file with no luck so far. 

sorry if this is a FAQ.  i'd like to know where to get a copy if there's one.

thanks, joel
