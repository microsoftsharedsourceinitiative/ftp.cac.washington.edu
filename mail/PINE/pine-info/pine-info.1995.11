Hi John,

Are you sure that you've not truly run out of memory? (RAM + swap space).
Pine will report the "Out of free storage" message only if it fails to 
obtain free memory (using malloc()). 

Just run "free" on another terminal at about the time Pine is to display 
the message "Out of free storage" and check the amount of free memory left.
If you're running short on memory you can (temporary) obtain additional swap 
space by letting Linux swap into a regular file. Checkout the command "swapon"
for more info.

Well, first you plug your cellular modem into the cigarette lighter of your '74 
Plymouth RoadRunner, connect it to your PowerBook 540, and then you insert your Zip 
cartridge and select "Upload" from the Apple menu.  Easy.  Then you tell us a little 
more about what kind of computer and software and connection you are using before 
asking such a silly question.

If you're using Zterm (or the like) on a Mac, you would use the "send files zmodem" 
option under the File menu.  You must make sure that you have correctly configured 
your System type (Unix/Opus).  Of course, I'm just assuming that "rz" is available on 
MCS. (Which should be a safe assumption.)  Zterm issues the "rz" command for you.  
This might not be true of all comm programs.  If it's not true for you, you manually 
enter "rz" before sending the file.

If you're using a Dos or Windows comm program, you select the appropriate file 
transfer option with the appropriate keystroke or menu command.

If you're telnetting into MCS, use the appropriate ftp client for your platform.  
"Fetch" on the Mac, "WinFTP" or "WSFtp" on the PC.

I really don't know if there is a temporary file, but perhaps you don't need
it to solve the problem. I would suggest you put this line in your .pinerc:

personal-print-command=cat - | /za/prx

(I guess it's supposed to be /za/prx and not /za/prx/)
You must, however, specify the printer number x.

I believe "cat -" is necessary, though it may seem a bit silly.

If you check the helpful text underneath where you set this up (Start 
Pine 3.91, type S for setup, then P for printer) you will see you need to 
give a command that the message is *piped* into.... there is no filename 
involved.

So as long as the user's "/za/prx" program can accept text piped into it, 
instead of just a filename on the command line then the necessary command 
is just "/za/prx".

I downloaded pine3.91.tar.Z from ftp.cac.washington.edu but have not been 
able to finish its installation. The documentation is ambiguous about 
porting versions. The file /doc/pine-ports was absent from the tar file.
Since therewere makefiles with extensions of .sol and .sun I tried 
'build sol' and 'build sun'. Both of these aborted with several complaints
about an absent 'default.mk' file. Can anyone tell me where to find a
source file that does indeed work with Solaris2.3. Thanks, Don

Hi!

My personal print command is "/za/prx/ filename", x ist the number of the 
printer I want to use, the filename is the name of the file I want to 
print. 

Now the Question: How I can set THAT print command in my .pinerc, I don't 
know how I can tell pine, that there has to be a filename. I think that 
pine save the file to print in a temporary file--but what might be the 
name of that file?

(Pine 3.91 for UNIX SVR4)

Please send a Cc of your answer to me (mail), thanks a lot in advance

	Ralf

standard mail.exe, I wanted to change the MUA to PC-Pine. 

I have on hand "pcpine_[fnpsw].zip" but as far as I can see, do they all 
need access to a remote INBOX, and I like to work on a local file like $MAIL.

Can someone give me a hint ?

If you have procmail/formail installed, try:

alias from	'formail -x From: -s <$MAILPATH'

This *does* skip "included non-quoted mails".

Does anyone know why messages created in Eudora don't show proper dates in
the index listing in Pine 3.91?  I've just noticed that Eudora doesn't
seem to add a "Date:" header. (at least I don't see one with Rich Headers
turned on) I guess this isn't Pine's fault but does anyone know of a
solution? 

Thanks,

	To whom ever can help me,


I am currently trying to get a hold of my cousin in the university of 
texas . I have not been able to get a holdof her so that she could clarify 
what exacltly her address is . So far all I got from her 
is"*(her identity which I will not disclose)*@.utexas.edu".

As you might already know this is not the address of the university of 
texas . Can you give it to me ? 

I suspect that the "@.utexas.edu" part is wrong . It would be much 
appreciated and welcomed .





					Thanks for your help,

good evening all..

i would like to know, if possible, how i might go about:

1. setting up an auto save before replying - trying to keep all
   communications back and forth in the appropriate fcc folders.

2. getting the news reader side to fcc to the list name rather
   than the individual authors.  same trick on saves.

3. dealing with incoming mail from abc@xyz.com that needs to be
   routed back to a different address (or addresses) on reply.

i can do all these things manually, just wondering if i am missing
something that would allow me to make any of them automatic..

thanks in advance, etc,

Subject: Detecting headers in folders
Date: 1 Nov 1995 04:36:43 GMT
Message-Id: <476tgr$igf@styx.uwa.edu.au>

I have the following problem:
How do I look through a Pine folder (containing headers and messages 
saved as text) and know where the header for each message starts?
I know the end of each header is marked as a blank line, but you can't 
mark the start of a header like this because the message itself could 
contain blank lines.
I'm writing a program to go through these folders and remove most of the 
fields from the headers, but I don't know of a reliable way of detecting 
the start of each header.  Obviously Pine can do it, does anyone out 
there know how?

Thanks
Graham

Sorry, left out a step. You have to get out of Pine and go to the shell

Mail headers are described by RFC0822.
If you just need a simple utility to weed away some header lines
where it does not matter whether the header lines are inside other mails
then you can take a look at the "weedout.sed" at

How do you do!
Well, one way is to export (function E) to a file on the host in your 
directory, then download to your PC. Or you can do a disk capture if your 
PC communication program has that function.  If you disk capture, its 
better done from the exported file using the Unix cat command, that way you 
don't get all the Pine menu options as part of the message.  I use a script 
(my communications program comes with one) to do all of this.

Pine does not receive the mail.  It only looks at folders which are filled
up by the programs which receives the email.
=>  Pine does not have such a setting.

We are having some trouble on our HPUX system related to Pine and SIGHUP. 
When an alterate editor is open, PINE does not get the SIGHUP signal sent
when the terminal is closed (it is apparently not supposed to).  So, PINE
stays open and keeps trying to reopen the editor, which succeeds or fails
depending on the editor. 

Simply enabling the signal handler didn't solve the problem.  So I
substituted exit for the signal handler, and this naturally works, but not
in a very nice way.  Any ideas how we can get PINE to die when the
terminal is closed and an alternate editor is being used?

I don't know why signal handling was disabled while pine waits for the
editor to finish, but I'll bet there is a reason.  Either this could be
changed and a handler that exits cleanly could be added, or pine could
check to see if it's process group still exists, however that's done.

Please e-mail replies to me, as I don't regularly read this group.  Thanks,

Andrew

Could be a problem with the MTA which sends away the mails.
I don't think that Eudora produces the faulty Date header.
Just guessing here.

It all depends on whether he saved the mail when he wrote it.
If he didn't save the mail when his editor dies the the changes are lost.

Even though pine dies, your editor might still be running.
In that case, the temporary file might still exist, too.
So go and look for the temporary file.

> He has typed this mail for 2 hrs.

Too bad.  I hope he saved the text once in a while.
General rule:  Whenever you don't want to retype what you did - save!

How should we know why he lost the connection?
This is a local problem which you should find.

> And he also want to know how to prevent the future occurrence.

Tell him to compose mails offline and to transfer them when the mails is
reading for being sent.  That's always the best way.

Subject: Pine 3.90 and Visible/Audible bells
Date: 1 Nov 1995 06:50:35 GMT
Message-Id: <4775br$s37@psuvax1.cse.psu.edu>

Hi! I'm using Pine 3.90 on Ultrix 4.4, under TCSH 6.00.02. I've set up my
TERMCAP <vt102> so that the system uses visible bells, not audible ones. To be
more precise, I've appended ":vb=:" to the end of my TERMCAP.

However, I noticed when I used PINE this evening that it ignored that setting,
beeping loud and clear when I hit a wrong key. I'd like to find a way for PINE
to obey the visible bells directive in my TERMCAP definition.

Unless I missed something, there's no way to tell 3.90 to shut up. :-) Is
there something I've missed? If not, I'd like to perhaps recommend that this
feature be added to the 3.92 (or later) wishlist. 

Thanks, in advance, for any information or advice. :-)

   How do I look through a Pine folder (containing headers and messages

   I know the end of each header is marked as a blank line, but you can't 
   mark the start of a header like this because the message itself could 
   contain blank lines.

A standard Berkeley style folder delineates messages by a "From " line
following a blank line.  Reading from the pine Tech Notes:

Berkeley Mail Format
     This format comes to us from the ancient UNIX
     mail  program,  /bin/mail.   (Note  that this
     doesn't have anything to  do  with  Berkeley,
     but  we call it the Berkeley mail file format
     anyway.) This program was  actually  used  to
     interactively  read  mail at one time, and is
     still used  on  many  systems  as  the  local
     delivery agent.  In the Berkeley mail format,
     a folder is a simple text file.  Each message
     (including  the  first)  must  start  with  a
     separator line which takes approximately  the
     form:

     From juser@u.example.edu  Wed Aug 11 14:32:33 1993


     Each  message  ends  with  two  blank  lines.   *
     There  are  actually several different varia-
     tions in the date part of the string,  twenty
     at  last  count.

* I think this should read "two newlines" -- i.e. _one_ blank line.

Hope this helps,

I don't know if this is going to be right, or if it is even going to help 
you, but do you know what your disk space quota on your server is? I know 
mine is only 10MB and that fills up fast. Try checking to see if you have 
surpassed your quota.

Since someone in my homehold ungraciously reads my PRIVATE email ALL the time.
  I can't get them to stop, so I have a question.  Is there a 
way that (assuming my address is fatbob@gordo.com), someone can send a 
message to "secret.fatbob@gordo.com", it will go to my folder "Secret"?  
This would be kooler than kool.  Or maybe there's a better solution that 
I'm not getting. (Yeah, I would use cryptography, but everyone I know is 
so lazy that they would just stop writting if I told them to encode the

Hi,
1. ELM makes use of the MAIL-environment-variable, i.e. at our site the 
   path to a user's mail is determined during login by e.g.
      export MAIL=/net/rzserv0/usr/spool/mail
   By this means we're able to access a user's mail not only from ONE place,
   but ( as it is on my site ) at an arbitrary location in a multiserver-
   environment
2. To my knowledge PINE has a similar feature 
   with the
     inbox-path=
   in the .pinerc-file.
   But this requires at least ONE PINE-Setup-run, which is not wanted for

Hello.

  My copy of PC-PINE is properly putting Eastern Standard Time on my 
outgoing messages; however, it is marking them Pacific Standard Time.  
For instace, if I mail a message 3 p.m. EST (-0500), it is marked 3 p.m. 
PST (-0800).

  This happens in both Windows 3.11, as well as Windows/NT, which is 
properly set for EST (-0500).  Mail I compose on my computer using 
different software (NUPOP) is properly stamped.

  Does anybody know how to fix the time zone marking on my outbound mail, 
or for that matter where PC-PINE gets the current time zone from?

Thanks Much!
      - Edward

Hi!  Thanks for your little pointer, but the problem is more the 
detection of where each header starts.  If the header is included in 
other mail (ie if somebody mailed me a header) then I'd want to consider 
it as just part of the message.

You don't need to modify any code; just put the env. variable on the right
side of the inbox-path variable in your system-wide pine.conf file.

  I think the easiest way to do it is SmartList package cooperating with
procmail package--these packages are made by the same person and are easy
to install. They can be downloaded from ftp.utia.cas.cz/pub/unix/. The
original site is somewhere in Germany. Hope this helps. V. S.

I use Pine right now on a Shell account via an Internet provider, 
Best.com, but I would like to use PC-Pine on my PC.

What I would mainly like to do is compose messages off-line, as needed, 
then just upload them once or twice a day, whenever I go on-line.

One of my PC's is at home; the other is at work, a bookshop, with five 
computers on a LanTastic network (but I access the Best.com Shell account 
directly from one of the workstations).

I gather there are about 5 versions of PC-Pine; can I use one of these in 
my situation, and if so, which one? I would rather not use the Windows 
version, as I am working for the most part under DesqView and DOS 6.2, 
using QEMM as the memory manager.

Many thanks,

Joe Luttrell

Is there any way in pine to search the body of the messages for a text
string?  "W" only searches the info that's in the index.  The only way
I know to do it is to leave pine and grep through the mail directory or
mail folder.

If not, can I add this as yet-another requirement?  I'd like to be able 
to specify to search subjects only, search all mail (including the body of the
message) in a folder, and search all mail (including body) of a folder
collection.

Subject: Extra Page When Printing Using "attached-to-ansi"
Date: Wed, 01 Nov 1995 19:00:59 GMT
Message-Id: <478g4b$7h2@gap.cco.caltech.edu>

I love the ability to print to my local printer, but I get a blank
page ejected after every e-mail message I print from Pine using the
"y" command and accepting "attached-to-ansi" as the printer.  I'm
using FTP Software's Windows(3.1)-based TNVT telnet program to connect
directly to my shell account on a UNIX host.  I've checked with FTP
Software and they say there's no way to control the page eject through
their program.  Any thoughts or suggestions?

You want to use the "Select" (";") command.

First you must enable this by going to the Setup Configuration screen (S 
then C from the Main Menu).  Turn on the "enable-aggregate-command-set" 
feature, then Exit (E) back to the Main Menu.

In the Folder Index (the list summarising your messages) type:

	;		...Select messages
	T		...based on a text item
	A		...all message text
	string		...the search string
	Return

The selected messages get an "X" shown at the start of their entries.

You can now do either or both of:

	Z		...Zoom the list down to just show the selected
			   messages  (another Z will unzoom it)
or
	A		...to apply a command to all the selected messages

You can cancel the list of selected messages by typing "; A" to unselect 
them all.  (If none are selected this same sequence selects them all.)

Hello, :)

Can someone give me a hint on setting up multiple address books?  I'm
using Pine 3.91 running on a Sun workstation.  I looked all through
pine's configuration file and in some of the help screens, but to no
avail.  I tried entering two filenames on the field

	address-book	= <   >

in the config but that didn't work either.

Please reply via email, and thanks in advance.  :)

Subject: pre-created addressbook ?
Date: 1 Nov 95 21:35:43 GMT
Message-Id: <andrea.815261743@pX1.stfx.ca>

I pre-create addressbook lists for faculty so that they may have a class
list ready to go.
The format I use is
classname tab classname tab ("lastname, firstname" <username> comma
space space space "lastname, firstname" <username> comma
...
space space space "lastname, firstname" <username>)

My instructions are just, download the file (the pile of them are in the
gopher) then
cat classname.pine >> .addressbook

But sometimes it doesn't work. Returned messages are:
Unbalanced '"'
or
Unbalanced '<'
but the files are generated by a script so there are no unbalanced
delimiters, and i've checked the files by hand too and they appear fine.
(Yes i know, i've made sure that the tabs come down ok)

So
1) is there a limit on the size of addressbook entries ?
   i don't think that this is my problem because one large class works
   fine, and a smaller one appears to be a problem
2) is it ok to use those dquote realname dquote entried
   what is the exact wanted addressbook format ? i don't wanna have to
   read the source code
   and what is the relationship with .addressbook.lu ?
3) is there some other obscure bug related to addressbooks
4) anyone else doing this

I've considered removing the realname sections, but then its hard for a
prof to try to matchup the usernames with their students when some leave
the class or new ones enter. Yes i know that finger info will be added,
but students like to put in funky names there so you don't actually get
their real names.

I have the packet driver version of pcpine 3.91 connecting to a Sun SPARC

pcpine, I get an error "Cant connect to mail server: " and the message is

Thanks a bunch to both of you!  This solution works great!

Do you know of a way to search all the mail in all the folders of a 
folder collection?  I don't think pine does this yet, right?

Did you exit and restart pine?  I have been using pine with jove since 3.91

Hello Everyone... I just wanted to ask if it's possible to 'auto-forward' 
my mail using Pine.  That is, I have two accounts, but want all the mail 
to go to one.  Is it possible? If you figure it out please e-mail me at:

tyren@pacifier.com

Please note: I won't be watching this newsgroup, so any reply into the 
newsgroup won't get to me.  Thanx,	
				Shane

Hi -

You are correct... as far as I know Pine cannot (yet?) search all folders 
of a folder collection.

How can I stop Pine 3.91 from appending a copy of each mail message sent to the

Delete the contents of the "Fcc:"-line in the header.

Go into (S)etup (C)onfig from the main menu, use the cursor arrow keys to
get to "default-fcc". If it says <No Value Set: using "sent-mail">, hit
(A)dd and then ENTER to change it to <Empty Value>. If a value is set,
simply hit ENTER to change it, delete it to leave it blank, and it should
say <Empty Value> as well.

The tmail delivery agent can accept a message to an address like
fatbob+secret@gordo.com and deliver it to fatbob's secret folder.  I
think you do need to make some small changes to sendmail to ignore the
"+secret" part of the address when deciding where to deliver to.
Tmail is available in

  Use ";" for Select, "T" for Text, and "A" for entire message text, then 
enter the search string. Messages containing the string will be "selected".

I'm a novice user of Pine and I have a serious problem with the news 
support of that program.
I have configured Pine to show News from two servers, but if I'm 
subscribed on one server, the newsgroup is shown also in the second!
Is there a trick to split the newsgroup lists by servers?
Thanks for all...

If you use a PC with a communications program that provides a script 
language, you can write a script to run the Pine commands to select and 
delete the undesired stuff (that is, if it has something distinguishing 
in the header or text).  You may want to go into setup and enable the 
aggregate command function if you haven't done so already.  This allows 
you to apply one command to all messages which meet the selection criteria.

Our you can just set the fcc variable in the .pinerc file accordingly:

default-fcc=""

And it won't do it anymore.

Nope the @utexas.edu thingy is correct so far, but you have to be more 
specific about who you're looking for.  2 choices:

1 If you have full internet access try the following URL and search thru 
the hypertext forms (there are 20 plus people at utexas with the string 
'song' in the name)

http://www.utexas.edu/

2 If you can't or don't know how to do that, send me private e-mail with 
more information about the person you are looking for, and I will write 
back to you.  Hope this helps.  G'Day.

Yes, you can forward all mails with the "forward" mechanism.

Try a domain of:     @mail.utexas.edu

I checked the University of Texas homepage/email directory, ran a search 
on some dummy names, and all the email addresses used the above domain.

Yes, a "filter" is the program used to deal with incoming mail.
This is independent to the "mailer" (mail user agent to be exact) you use,
ie it does not matter whether you use Pine, Elm, whatever to read your mail.

Elm comes with a simple to use filter named "filter".
If it is installed on your system then just follow these instructions:
	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/elm.filter.html

There is also a link to the "Filter FAQ" and more.

Subject: PINE 3.91/3.92 and nntp 'pinging'
Date: 2 Nov 1995 01:00:01 GMT
Message-Id: <47956h$es6@mark.ucdavis.edu>


Greetings, all:

     We have PINE 3.91 running on a sparc (Solaris 2.3), using a remote 
newsfeed, and the following problem has arisen:  When a user has the 
expanded-view-of-folders option toggled on, and has a news collection which 
points to the remote nntp server, then every time they open PINE, even just 
their INBOX or another local mail file, PINE keeps establishing connections to 
the nntp-server, presumably to keep updating the list of subscribed newsgroups.

     Since most users check their e-mail far more often than they use the news 
services, is there a way to suppress this, or alternatively to have the program 
allow them to select expanded-view-of-folders for their Mail collection ONLY? 
(Most of them seem to find it confusing to have to expand the folder each time 
they look at an index...).  If this isn't possible in 3.91, any hope it might be 
available in 3.92 or a future release?

     Thanks in advance for any information you may have on this.

  I think there is no system configuration to prevent this. I'd like to be

  You have to delete the FCC: field everytime you send an e-mail ...

  If you're in UNIX, you can personalize your real name by entering "chfn"
or "password -f" at the UNIX prompt.
  If you're not using UNIX or don't want to change the real name in your
UNIX account, then change Pine --- press S and C at Pine's main menu. 
Then press A to add a value to the field "personal-name".

The easiest solution is to use a "Reply-To:" customized header.

There are other options available for changing your actual FROM line, 
but they require the ability to recompile pine and/or edit sendmail.
If you are interested, e-mail me.

HI,
I sent out the message early in the week about windows for pine.  Well,
I'm starting to get used to Pine and really like it.  However,
I still can't figure out how to get on to the webb using this system.  
Can anyone help?

Hello pine experts, many times when I enter to a newsgroup and after 
waiting a couple seconds, the newsgroup turned out to be empty. Anyone 
knows how to show only unempty newgroups? Also, how to stop adding new 
newsgroups when I starts pine? Thank you very much.

Pine is not a web browser.  Well, not yet.  ;-)
You could, however, request web pages via email requests.

Here is an example:

	header:		To: webmail@curia.ucc.ie
			Subject: anytext

	body:		go http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/

I am only reproducing this from a post.
I have never verified it.  But I will try it right away.

To cite a recent (very recent!) post to this list:

	From: gs01mew@panther.Gsu.EDU (Eric Wardowski)
	Subject: Re: Screen size in Pine on Unix
	Date: 30 Oct 1995 14:22:10 GMT

	[...]
	Got an answer.  I had to type "stty rows 42" to get the rest of the
	programs to recognize the screen size.  As far as the rest, I run
	Procomm Plus 2.01 for DOS.  I find that occasionally I have to type
	<ALT>-<U> to do a "Reset Terminal" in Procomm when Pine had set the
	terminal lines to 22 or 24.  Now all works well!

Summary:
 Try "stty rows 50" at you shell and then start Pine again from that shell.

Message-Id: <jblake-021195145133@beauzeau.cc.binghamton.edu>

I'm trying to figure something out -- it's probably something simple that
I'm overlooking. I've decided to swallow my pride and beg for help from the
cogniscenti.

We're using an IMAP server on campus, and I have a mailbox there with the
id of 'jblake'. I'm reading my mail using PC-Pine sometimes, and other
times from a Unix system (SunOS) where my id is 'jim'.

I can read my IMAP mail just by specifying the INBOX path correctly. But
when I send mail, I want it to appear to come from 'jblake', and I can't
seem to make that happen.

PC-Pine accepts a parameter for "user-id=jblake". I specify that and my
domain, and voila!, the mail I send appears to come from
jblake@binghamton.edu.

Unix Pine, on the other hand, does not recognize the "user-id" parameter,
and though I twist and turn and set environment variables until I get
tired, my mail still appears to come from jim#binghamton.edu -- which is
not a valid address!

I know of other people on campus who have this problem also; some using
SunOS and some using Solaris. Any suggestions will be appreciated.

You can't stop them being *shown* (after all, you *have* subscribed to them).

But what you *can* do is press the Tab key.

This moves you to the next New message in the current newsgroup.  If 
there isn't one it offers to keep searching through newsgroups (skipping 
empty ones) until it fins one.  If there are no more it offers to return 
you to the INBOX.

I cannot type 8bit characters in the "Subject" field. From the source
programs, I got to know only 7bit characters can be displyed in header
fields. The related file is composer.c which is located in pine3.91/pine. 
Anyone who can help me solve this problem? Thanks for your kind attention.

    You seem to be referring to using Pine on Unix or some sort of 
Unix-like system.  In that case, Ctrl-Z should get you out to the shell.  
Use 'fg' (foreground) to resume Pine.

Yup.  It is, but it is a good question.

There are several shell scripts that do exactly what you want.

One is mkpgp which you can find out about by sending mail
to shlutsky@lipschitz.sfasu.edu (with subject "mkpgp" I think).

Another, editpgp is available on the main UK pgp ftp site:
ftp.ox.ac.uk in /pub/crypto/pgp.  Look in the utils directory there.

There is also something called BAP (Bryce's Auto PGP), I'm not
sure exactly where that can be gotten.

All of these work by setting them up as your "external editor".

Message-Id: <47askb$4gb8@indus.unm.edu>

I am using Pine for Unix and have two questions:

     (1)  Is there a way to do "elm -z" at the system promt- this would
          check INBOX for messages and invoke Pine (pine -i) if so.

     (2)  Is there a way to be notified when newmail arrives after login?
          Before I had 'newmail -i <some_time>' in .login to do this.

Thanks for any help/pointers.

I'm confident that your mail program won't!  That is, an unescaped "From

two messages.  That's why many mail transport agents prepend '>' to
lines starting with "From ".

I am so sorry to all you good readers to have to post this way:

However 3 days ago I posted my unsubscribe correctly, received message that
my request was forwarded to list-owner and waited.  Yesterday, I
specifically asked listowner to unsubscribe me, with explanation. No response.

This now is a very brief request to the group, unfortunately.  It is my next
to last resort!!!!!!!!!!!

UNSUBSCRIBE

    REPEAT:  UNSUBSCRIBE ME

        ONCE AGAIN:  UNSUBSCRIBE ME NOW

             CAN YOU HEAR ME?   REMOVE MY NAME FROM YOUR LIST

I hope it will no longer be necessary to shout, or to expand the length or
frequency.

Thank your for your prompt attention         -(;>]

8bit characters are not allowed in message headers without
RFC1522-style encoding, which will not be supported in Pine until
version 3.92.

This should be equivalent to "size of mailbox is zero".
Most shells have a text for this, eg for the zsh this would be:
 if [[ -s file ]]; then pine; else pine -i; fi

I don't see a reason why elm should be used at all to start pine.

So - how doee Pine recognize mails within mails?
The FAQ says it does not regard the Content-Length header.
Will Pine stumble over mails in mails when the MTA does not escape "From_"
lines?

How do I use the alternate editor?  I've enabled it in my

when I hit ^_, all it seems to do is a screen refresh, and
prints "7 lines inserted" at the bottom.

Is it possible to change the "from:" part of an outgoing message
in such a way that there is no way to recover the real sender ?
If that is possible, everybody could sign her outgoing message with 
my name and address and send it to whomever ?!

The best thing to do is make a .forward file  which directs procmail to
delete all the messages. Either that, or go in /var/spool/mail and make
a symbolic link for <username> to /dev/null. :-)

How do I configure PC-Pine to allow for several people receiving mail on

I am using PINE 3.91 on my laptop. When at work the laptop is on a
LAN. While all other LAN services seem to work OK, I am not able to
send mail. I can receive mail just fine, but when I try to send (or
forward, or reply...) I get the following error message:

"Can't send message without an open remote folder."

Does anyone have any ideas on this? I can't figure it out.

    I don't know that this is the case, of course, but at least consider=20

I have started using the alternative spellchecker i-spell instead of the 
one provided by pico.  I like it better but it has one problem:  It 
checks not only the text I have written, but also forwarded text which is 
marked by >.  Pine's normal spellchecker doesn't do this.  Is there any 
way to tell i-spell not to check lines marked with a > ?  Thanx.  Ciao.  AK

You need the HP ANSI C compiler and then pick up this from one of the

Full instructions are in the HPUX.Install document in that package (a

I was wondering what algorithm Pine 3.91 uses when it sorts things like 
the address book, news posts, etc.  It seems really slow here, though it 
could be caused by the Telnet connection.  Does it use something like 
Bubble Sort?  I wondered if it would speed things up if Pine used the 
Quick Sort algorithm instead.  Any thoughts?

This is not to talk about a bug.... only to figure out how to save a file 
onto my computer.


I am working through a modem.  I am accessing the internet using the 
Hebrew University Spinach system here in Jerusalem. I have files that I 
would like to download onto my coputer.  Supposedly you can do it through 
Pine.  How does this work?  If pine cannot do it, can you tell me how!

Thanks,

Jon Levy

In Pine 3.91, is there a way to shell to the operating system on AIX?  
There doesn't seem to be a command for this.  If there isn't, will one be 
added in the future release?

As the menubar in the lower lines says: S for SAVE (You can also try E for EXPORT, then the headers
won't be saved).

Steve,
I'm guessing that you are actually using PC-Pine...

That message occurs if Pine doesn't think you have an authenticated IMAP
connection open.  The requirement to have an open IMAP folder before
sending is to allow PC-Pine to put a traceable x-sender line into outgoing
messages to mitigate the threat of forged messages.

Hi folks!

Ist it possible to set MIME headers in Pine? What I really need, is
Content-Type. I have to write in English, German and Russian and clearly
_one_ character set just doesn't exist for all.

Currently I am using ELM but it is not possible there (at least in 
2.4 and next version comes "soon" :-)

So I am looking for software which allows it.

Thanks in advance

Ah! I didn't know about that one.  And it seems you have to go into 
setup - configure and enable Pine suspension first.  Thanks, I will add 
that to my script.

Hello everyone,
Me again!  I promise this will be my last post for at least a few days;)
Can anyone tell me what the AFS folder in pine is used for?  I think I've 
got the others figured out but still don't know what I do with that one.
Thanks,

p.s.  I think I just found a browser.  I hit control T while in attchmnt 
and got into something that had browser in the title.  Sound familiar to 
anyone?

    You need to use the Bcc: ("blind carbon copy") header field.  Put the 
cursor in the headers and press Ctrl-L to get "rich headers."  Then put 
the addresses of all your recipients in Bcc: (you can use an alias list 
if you do this very often).  Note that you need to put _something_ in the 
To: field.  The simplest thing is just to send the message To: yourself 
and Bcc: to everybody you really want it to go to.  If you do not have 
Bcc: when you display rich headers, go into Setup/Config and add it.

t directory are the news groups for pine set up in? I would 
like to manually go in and take a bunch of them out becuase
it would take to long to go through and delete them one by 
one.


Please e-mail me privately..

I have the same question as Frederick.  Does PINE work with MMDF  and 
I'll go a bit further and ask does PINE work under SCO UNIX setup with 
mmdf??????

The subject says it all.  I installed Linux 1.2.12 on my fathers laptop 
with no problem.  He now has internet access, and is trying to post to 
newsgroups from pine.  At the moment, he get error 441 or 480 ( He's not 
in at the mo, so I can't check ) .  This error number is associated with 
the subject of this post.
The same error occurs when using tin or netscape.
My quaestion is : Is this a pine error?  Or is it an error with the provider?

Please send all replies to either :

    It is certainly doable.  I do it frequently.  You didn't say what 
operating system you are running Pine under (Unix, MS-DOS, whatever), so 
details may differ.  In Unix Pine, each folder is simply a flat ASCII 
file with path $HOME/mail/<folder-name> (at least the way it's set up for 
me).  I just download a folder file to my PC the way I would download any 
other ASCII file.  Just _how_ depends on your particular software setup.  
There may not be a single flat answer on just what to do.

:     This is fine provided all of your incoming mail is in your INBOX

: been wanting a utility (Perl OK) that would list the headers of mail not 
: only remaining in the INBOX but also in pre-sorted folders.

It's just five awk-commands, see at the end :-)
NOTES
- This is too slow for big files. A C version would do better.
- Your awk will need "toupper()". This is ok e.g. with AIX and Linux,
  but not e.g. with IRIX 4 or SunOS 5.
- Have an eye on the /var/spool/mail path.
- You will have to write the man page yourself ...

	The location of your system mailbox is stored in the MAILBOX or MAIL

	You may omit the -u flag if the user parameter is not equal to any

Please help,

I seem to have a bit of a problem, a co-worker of mine sent me mail with 
an WordPerfect attachment from the office to my school account.  Work 
uses MS Office 4.0 e-mail and school uses Pine 3.81 (or something like that)
Somewhere in the process, the attachment was UUencoded.  However, for me 
to be able to use it, I'm home for the weekend with no chance to get to 
the office, I need to decode it.  Is this possible?  If so what's the 
process?  I'd appreciate any help I get, I'm on deadline for next week.
If you've got any suggestions send 'em to met at philmac@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu

Thanks,

Phil

I suddenly find that the PRYNT command allows me to print less than a page
of output. What might I have done to limit the output on my printer.

In order to get around the difficulty I EXPORT, download and print the
document with my word processor which is a round-about nuisance.

Many thanks!			Sol James	sjames@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us

Subject: email-only accounts via imap

Message-Id: <47gm38$rq3@silver.scs.unr.edu>

We are in the process of setting up a dedicated host to receive
and spool incoming mail.  The proposed host currently runs
SunOS 4.1.3; we'll be upgrading to Solaris 2.4 in the relatively
near future.  Imapd (from Univ. of of Washington) is installed on
this mailhost system.

Most of our users will log in to a group of UNIX hosts and read
their mail with pine, with their inbox being on the remote mailhost.

Since the users have already logged in and given their passwords once,
we'll like to bypass the imap login/password authentication for these
users.  Users using imap clients from other hosts should still be
subject to the regular authentication process.

The imap documentation says the following:

     If you want to enable the rimap capability, which allows users with a
 suitable client and .rhosts file on the server to access IMAP services
 without transmitting her password in the clear over the network, you need
 to have /etc/rimapd as a link to the real copy of imapd.  Assuming you have
 imapd installed on /usr/local/etc as above:
	% ln -s /usr/local/etc/imapd /etc/rimapd

     Technical note: rimap works by having the client routine tcp_aopen()
 invoke `rsh _host_ exec /etc/rimapd' in an child process, and then
 returning pipes to that process' standard I/O instead of a TCP socket.  You
 can set up `e-mail only accounts' by making the shell be something which
 accepts only that string and not ordinary Unix shell commands.

Perhaps it's trivial, but has someone already concocted a version of the
"something which accepts only that string" so that I don't have to
re-invent the wheel?

I'd also welcome advice from those who have already set up mailhosts
along similar lines.  Have you had problems or discovered difficulties
that I should be aware of?

Thanks.

Edward, 

>From the Pine Technical notes, p. 18 (a very useful resource)

Set an environment variable TZ in your autoexec.bat

TZ=ZZZ[+H]H[:MM:SS:TTT]

where ZZZ is your standard time zone, e.g., EST
      + (or -) H[:MM:SS] its offset from GMT
      TTT is your summer or daylight savings time zone, e.g., EDT

The default values for a DOS/Windows system are PST-8PDT (US Pacific Time
and the location of Microsoft's headquarters.

The correct setting for someone in the US eastern time zone would be 

SET TZ=EST-5EDT

I agree with your concerns, but what does this have to do with using

be glad to discuss the issue.

Jill,

    I'm clueless about most things but slightly less so about the 
Internet. :-)

    A browser can be many things.  Mosaic, NetScape, Lynx are different
browsers for the World Wide Web.  Pine is a browser (and editor) for email
and newsgroups (USENET); and, NN & TIN are browsers only for newsgroups.

    If your using Pine from an account on a host (remote) system, as I 
assume, then you may wish to ask your sysop about the availability of 
Lynx.  Lynx is widely available on host systems to browse the WWW. It is 
a text only Web browser.

    The other true Web browsers, ala Mosaic, need access to your 
workstations video and sound capabilities which require a more 
sophisticated link to your host.  These links are called PPP or SLIP.  
These links are becoming much more common as Internet Service Providers 
(ISPs) pop up.

I'm trying to fix up pine for a friend.  She's on a mailing list where
every message is distributed in the following form:

Sender: NAME OF MAILING LIST
From: ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF MESSAGE

Now, pine displays that each message is from NAME OF MAILING LIST (sender)
rather than the real author (from field).  I've looked in the pine faq,
but I haven't seen anything like this.  Elm doesn't have this problem, but
how do get it right in pine?

How does one upload a file to his/her directory, where then he/she can 
attach it? Thank you very much for your help.

Is there a port for SGI Irix 5.x? The build file includes the following
directions:

See the document doc/pine-ports for a list of other platforms that
Pine has been ported to and for details about these and other ports.


but there is no such file in the .tar.gz. I opened it a second time in
case I had somehow rmoved it, to no avail.

Any help would be appreciated,

Hans

This seems a bit simplistic when you consider that the message might well 
contain a line starting with the word "From ".  From some of the 
information I've received following this thread I've come across another 
way of doing it:
Whenever you come across a line starting with "From " you then say "This 
might be a new header".  You look at the following lines which (if it's a 
header) must all start with "Received from: ", "X-Status: " or a large 
number of other field names, unless they are part of a "To: " or "Cc: " 
field, in which case they probably start with a few spaces.  Then when 
you get a blank line (end of header) you count the number of fields you 
came across.  If this number is greater than a certain limit, you say 
"right I've found a header".  I guess about 9 or so fields would be a 
good sign of a header.

Any comments on this algorithm?  It will still think that a header within 
a message is a new header :(

	People who come from foreign countries consider America as a 
country of freedom and equality. However, this equality is prescribed 
only to the citizens of America. Why do international students have to 
pay 3 times bigger tuition then americans?

''And even this does not skip "included non-quoted mails".''
Anyone have a script which takes care of "included" mails?

    Has anyone had any experience with using Jpico (a configured version 
of the joe editor) as an alternate editor with Unix Pine?  I just set it 
up and have gotten a few anomalous results (as well as some screen 
delay).  Maybe I haven't played with it long enough.  Email me if you 
don't think it would be of general interest for comp.mail.pine.  (Jpico 
is an editor that works a lot like Pico but has many additional 
features.)

	Edit a file in your home directory called ".forward" with the 
content in the format of "id@host.domain".  I do it with my three 
accounts, so I only have to log in to one host to check my mail.  This 
function is not pine-specific, so you could use it with any sort of 
mailreader that you wanted.  Pine does, however indicate that it was sent 
to the alternate address, and not to the current server in the to: line.


eg:
".forward" on the server win95.microsoft.com
bill_gates@redmond.microsoft.com

If I send mail to "bill_gates@win95.microsoft.com" it wil get forwarded 
to "bill_gates@redmond.microsoft.com", so he only has to check his mail 
in one place, but he'll know that you sent him mail at win95, not redmond.

good luck.

If you are on a system with egrep, then perhaps you can use sed as well.
You could include the sed command '/^$/,$d' to keep just the header
based on RFC 822 paragraph 3.1 "The body is ... It is separated from
the headers by a null line (i.e.,  a line with nothing preceding the CRLF)."
There are complications with trying to get all this on an alias line, but
the alias could just call a script or it could be a script called "from".

Hi all!

I have just installed PINE 3.91 to test it. Seems to be great thing. But
two questions:


1. is it possible to import ELM aliases into PINE?

2. is it possible to share PINE address book between Unix and PC?
(I mean for the same user)
Thanks for help!

If that was possible to fake the From: line then, yes, anyone could send
letters to someone pretending to be you.
However, this cannot be done with (good) mailers.

Unfortunately, spoofing mail is very simple to do with other programs.
If you want to make sure that noone can pretend to be you
then you should add information (eg a PGP signature)
which allows a check to be done on the contents.
Read about such things in "alt.security.pgp".

A "web browser" is a program which can connect to "web servers",
actually a program on a machine ("host") which sends files usually set in
HTML (hypertext markup language).
Ask your sys admin to install a browser (netscape, mosaic, lynx, ...) for you.

Any header might be broken across several lines, providing each following
line starts with white space.

Nine lines may be a good sign, but the tenth line might be a non valid header
lines.  This would allow anyone to send you mails with pseudo headers which
only require nine lines and thus fool your script.

Seriously, this is a chance of a lifetime.  I want all you naughty boys 
to contact me at once.  Do not delay.  Location is unimportant.

Let me know how you've been naughty and what type of corrective 
punishment you deem appropriate.  It's time we clean up the net.

I have an FTP.EXE file in Pine.  I'm using Windows 95 and the Plus

Of course, this won't work if you only have IMAP access to your INBOX file.

This error message is merely being *reported* by Pine.  The message is 
actually coming from your news server (its disk is full).

When you see something like this why not ask your local systems 
administrator/service provider in the first instance?

As you mention a StyleWriter I am assuming you are using an Apple Macintosh.

I am also assuming that you are running a terminal emulator (eg, NCSA 
Telnet) on the Macintosh and then logging in to a UNIX computer, from 
where you then run Pine.

Pine, being a UNIX program, knows about the UNIX system's printers.  It 
does not know about any printer you have attached to your Macintosh.

Well, almost...

By going to the Setup Printer screen you can tell Pine to use an 
"attached-to-ansi" option.  This causes Pine to send the message text 
down the connection to your machine surrounded by special codes to start 
and stop an attached printer.

If and only if your terminal emulator recognises and acts on these 
"printer start" and "printer stop" codes can it redirect the arriving 
text to the printer.

Thus in order for this to work your terminal emulator MUST support these 
codes.

The free Mac Kermit program doesn't (I think).
NCSA Telnet version 2.6 onwards does (the current version is 2.7b4).

I am working with a network administrator to set up Imap on my main 
server that I use to log into the internet.  We set it up today, and 
there's been a couple problems that if anyone has any clue as to how to 
solve, it would be appreciated.  The first main problem is this.  After 
setting the server up, we wanted to check it by doing a "telnet" to port 
143.  When we do this, neither one of us know the command to quit, so we 
exit out of telnet by hitting ctrl-] and when we get the telnet prompt, 
hit ctrl-d.  When I do this, Imap doesn't seem to be ending, and 
therefore doesn't kill the process which I initiate when I do the 
telnet.  Does anyone know why this could be happening?  To let you know a 
little bit about the server, it's running bsdi unix.  With that being all 
I know, I really couldn't help in the technical aspects of it.  My second 
question has to deal with PCPine on my end.  How much memory does pcpine 
require to run at full potential?  Thanks in advance for any information 
anyone might have regarding these two matters.

Subject: Pico mystery...
Date: 6 Nov 1995 08:29:17 GMT
Message-Id: <47kh0t$b6g@news2.cts.com>

Can anybody help me solve this mystery:

I edited a few files in pico, in my home directory. I know they are 
there, because I can recall them with ^R as long as I remember their name.
The latter is sometimes a problem.

But when I ask to see a list of my files (from the unix promt I changed 
to my home directory and asked "ls", it lists all kinds of weird stuff 
I've never heard of, but none of my files.

So, where are they? How can I see them listed?

Please e-mail if you have a suggestion...

Simone

P.S. Last time I tried the "ls" command I actually DID see my files 
listed. Today, it gave me a bunch of other stuff instead. Is my computer 
going nuts?

Same problem - if I EXPORT it will go to my home directory in the college

Marty,

In our context, running the app off of a Novel 3.12 server, we do this
here by pointing PC-Pine for Windows to specific pinerc files using the -p
switch. Set up the program icon to read f:\apps\winpine\pine.exe
-p:\users\%user%\mail\pinerc, where %user% is an environment variable the
Novell login process creates. This lets each user store their pinerc file
and local mailbox collections in a secure place. You could, however,
create multiple program manager icons, each hardcoded to a specific pinerc
file.

Hi Pine people,

I've been converted to the Pine religion. It's a good mailer, I use it 
regularly on my unix box (hp-ux 9.01)

One complain: I cannot switch folders by simly typing the folder name. I 
have a lot of mail folders, and looking for one is often harder than 
simply typing the name I know.

Another complain: The news reader does not tell me if there are 'new news'.
I have other readers (Tin or Nuntius in Mac) that flag the news folder 
that contain messages I have'nt seen yet.

But anyway, these are minor comments.

Now a couple of questions:


Is there a Mac Version of Pine?

The PC version, what network software requirement has? Does it save the 
folders in the local disk?

Thank you,


Frederic Udina

Just tried it.  Unfortunately, "rows 50" is not accepted by stty.  At 
least not the stty on my system.  I could find no equivalent in the man 
page, either.  Perhaps I have a funky version of stty.  It claims 
"conformance with the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 3, 1989", for 
whatever that's worth!

Oh well...  I'll keep searching...

John,
   I'm interested in looking at some examples of address books that
exhibit the parsing problems if you don't mind.  I could figure out
whether there is a bug that we should fix or whether something about the
entries doesn't match the required syntax.  I think that would be easier
than trying to explain without an example.  Thanks.

Thanks!  :-)

Well, although I do a lot for ELM, I thought it was about time I looked into
the questions that PINE users have aout email.
I am collecting info for a "ELM vs PINE" comparison.
So far, both have the pluses, but both could need some featured which users
need nowadays.

I will let you know about the comparison as soon as I have a little more time.

Btw, I don't think that ELM is dead.  The developers are busy coding.
No, there is no release date.  ;-)

You don't really need this option for PC-Pine, since --unlike Unix Pine--
you can set the username variable in PC-Pine (as well as user-domain).

   Sven  [too lazy to test]

If the line in question has a valid format (i.e. contains a properly
formatted date after the From_), pine will parse the mail as two
adjacent messages.  If not, pine will see it all as one message.

BTW, this message parsing convention is not at all unique to pine.  The
standard Unix mail utilities have always (?) used it.  Regarding
alternatives, I've seen lots of reports about Content-Length: breaking
frequently.

Is it possible to use Pine on a local mailbox ?

We are using Pine for a couple of months on SCO Unix and OpenServer (MMDF). 

Because we have some travelling notebook's running Kendra's UUPC with a
standard mail.exe, we wanted to change the Mail-User-Agent to PC-Pine. 

We have on hand the "pcpine_[fnpsw].zip" but as far as I can see, they all
need access to a remote INBOX, and I like to work on a local file like
$MAIL, so we can read and write our mail offline.

PC-Pine needs a minimum of 500k low-memory.  It doesn't use any
extended/expanded memory...

When I view messages in the current folder (the I option), some of the 
sender's address are not shown correctly. Instead, the "To: myaddress" 
is shown. This only happens to some but not all e-mail. The problem this 
causes is that I cannot use R command to reply to the sender because of 
the incorrect address. Why this happens and how to correct it? Thanks.

Barbara,

    Yes, I believe email has changed the way we communicate in the work 
place.  Until recently, I worked for the US Army Research Laboratory 
where we used email to assign, coordinate and report our work.  I think 
the government, in general, has been very quick to use email.  Government 
work is mostly about collecting and disseminating information and email 
is ideally suited to it.  Since the Internet was initiated by the US 
Government's Advanced Research Project Agency, it was natural that email 
use should have spread quickly.  Of course, it is easy now for anyone 
to get an email account.

    Because electronic mail provides written information to groups of people
simultaneously, it improves over telephonic and oral communication, in many
(most ?) cases.  My group worked with data and analysis.  The quality of 
information exchange was greatly improved once we adopted email.  Before 
email, data was often transcribed from phone calls which usually resulted 
in less data communicated and more errors.  After email, we obtained much 
more data which we could immediately cut and paste into our studies.  I 
would not say the we did less work but more productive, quality work was 
done.

    In the old days, most written communication required approval up the
hierarchy.  The main reason for this was that it was written, which gave it
more stature.  Most of it was coordination between functionaries at the smae
level of different organizations and did not need to be hoisted up the food
chain.  Today, this information is routinely exchanged between the
functionaries with only a Courtesy Copy (CC) sent to the chiefs.  Information
gets to where it's needed sooner. 

    Good luck with your thesis.

I am going to set up pine on a bunch of Unix boxes that are
basically just dumb terminal servers. The imapd will be running
on a seperate host. The use of pine will be through a common
userid that is currently used in a menuing environment which
allows the users to get to a few applications on the Internet.

What I'm looking for is a /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed file
that would allow these users to access their remote mailbox and
any folders, but now allow them to keep anything on those Unix
terminal servers. 

I'm hoping that some of you have already set up something similar
to this, so I don't have to re-invent the wheel.

Thanks for any and all help.

Hi,

I would like to know how exactly is the message piped to a unix command 
using Pines "| Pipe" facility. Does it passsomething like :

cat <message> | <unix command>

I would like to know if the message can be passed on to another program 
without using the alt-editor command.

Thanks.

The "To: myaddress" is only shown if you sent the message, or if there
is no valid sender's address in the message.  In the latter case, Pine
has no way to know where to send a reply...

As most people are aware ^L in an ordinary folder (usually the INBOX) can 
be used to clear the screen and redraw it, and check for newly arrived 
messages in the process.

However when reading a News folder (newsgroup) ^L only clears the screen 
and redraws it: it doesn't appear to check for any newly arrived articles 
in the newsgroup.

This would actually be extremely useful, and also in keeping with its use 
in an ordinary folder.

Any comments?

I have 2 accounts, one at kos.sgh and one at bbs.sas . I would
like to forward all my mail from bbs.sas to kos.sgh. I heard 
that a .forward file is needed. Can anyone tell me how to do it?

I make use of several mail programs.
When I telnet to kos, I use pine, elm or Mail.
When I am using Windows 3.1/3.11, I use Euroda or MSMAIl.
Is there any way to make these program recognise that I
have 2 accounts, and could mail from them individually.
i.e. I am physically at SGH but my E-mail appears to be from
bbs.sas. kos is a SUN Solaris 2.x machine and my PC is
running Windows 3.1/3.11. As the E-mail administrator, I
need to reconfgiure each program so that it can recognise 
2 accounts. Any way to do this ? 2 sets of binaries are needed,
1 for Sun solaris, 1 for Windows 3.1/3.11.

I am also having a slight problem with 
pine/elm/mail/MSmail/Euroda. How do I set up the Sun Solaris and
Windows 3.1/3.11 so that it will automatically perform
uudecoding of E-mails and unstuffit(unhqx, for mac files)
from Elm/Pine/Mail(sun solaris) and MSMAIl/Euroda(windows 
3.1/3.11), 2 set of binaries are needed, 1 for SUn and 1 for
windows 3.1/3.11.

Thank you for your help.

Happy halloween,

You can change the From-Header with PINE (You have to recompile it with another seting), but PINE is 
clever on this one: It wills end an extra Header with you original address.

Take a look at this email with H (Full Headers), you will see it.

Is a valid "From_" line enough?
Or does Pine do a test on the following lines for a vaild header?

Which mailers honor the Content-Length: line?

No.

It could be if the sysadmin of that system has set up an alias for this.

(Of course you can write a shellscript to generate yourself such an alias by taking all usernames from 
/etc/passwd or wherever the usernames live (/var/yp/... or so)

I have a problem here that is driving me sane. I am trying to configure the
pine program to read and post to newsgroups. I configured as follows:

---------------------------------snip------------------------------


personal-name          = <No Value Set: using "Fred Cherry">
user-domain            = <No Value Set: using "usa.net">
smtp-server            = <No Value Set>
nntp-server            = <No Value Set: using news.usa.net>
inbox-path             = <No Value Set: using "inbox">
folder-collections     = <No Value Set: using mail/[]>
news-collections       = <No Value Set: using *{news.usa.net/nntp}[]>
default-fcc            = <No Value Set: using "sent-mail">
postponed-folder       = <No Value Set: using "postponed-msgs">
read-message-folder    = <No Value Set>
signature-file         = <No Value Set: using ".signature">
global-address-book    = <No Value Set>
address-book           = <No Value Set: using .addressbook>
feature-list           =

---------------------------snip--------------------------------------

Now, after doing that and leaving Pine, and then opening the Pine program
again, I get the following:


-----------------------------snip-----------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder-collection <mail/[]>  ** Default for Saves **                     (Local)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
News-collection <<No Value Set: using>                                  (Remote)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]









? Help       M Main Menu  P PrevFldr    - PrevPage    D Delete      R Rename
O OTHER CMDS V [Select]   N NextFldr  Spc NextPage    A Add


---------------------------------snip-------------------------------

Then, when I highlight "[ Select Here to See Expanded List ]" on the
bottom, it sez that the list is empty. So, then I try to add newsgroups.
But, no matter what newsgroup I try to add, it tells me: "Newsgroup doesn't
exist."

What am I doing wrong?

On your bbs.sas account create a .forward file in your home directory
that contains the email address that the mail should be forwarded to.

I use pine's commmand line flags to do this, e.g.:

  pine -p pinerc.kos

to use a different pinerc file.  Note that in order to change the From 
line in pine you need to compile it with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM not 
commented out.

Another thing that I do is link my Mail and mail directories so that
pine and elm use the same default directories for mail folders.  I
have details about this at:

http://www.smartpages.com/faqs/usenet/software/nn/getting-started/faq-doc-58.html

How about just using  MIME on all your platforms?

Good luck,

How about

pine -I ".. \

The backslash at the end prevents your shell fro thinking EndOfLine = EndOfCommand

As far as I recall it, this is a define in the sources. So only recompiling can change this.

I do this all the time.  'g', then I am prompted for folder name.  If I type

Isn't this what you want and then some?

Is it possible to show only the group name in your messages, rather lines 
of individual names?  If you have a group made up of more than a few 
people it is annoying to have to scroll through the list of names to get 
to the body of the note.

Friend, 
 
 
Export the note to your home directory.  For simplicity's sake, 
give it a one letter filename. 
 
Open the compose message screen.  Type in your message.  Position 
the cursor a few lines below your message.  Press control-R, type 
in the one-letter filename.  The note will appear (with the first 
line of the note on the line where you positioned the cursor). 
 
Of course, if the note already had >'s in it when you first re- 
ceived it... 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim

Hi,

I recently received a message that flashed quickly across my screen in 
pine. I was told that this message probably included terminal control 
code set up by my shell. I'm not sure what this means & wonder if 
somebody could shed some light on it for me.

Thanks,

  I have been hacking pine to do this. because of the nature of the stream
filters inside pine it is very difficult.  So far I have not been
successful.  Another thing that i am trying to get it to do is to STOP
quoting a message once it hits a line of -----------------------'s (which
denote a forwardedmessage block on some mailers)

  If anyone has got this working let me know.

  The place to look is filters.c, look for the gf_prefix() function.

The problem is that there is indeed a valid address of sender (see the 
enclosed) and there is no problem when using the UNIX mail program to 
list the incoming e-mail. The sender's address always shows up correctly 
in UNIX mail. But when using the I option in the PINE's main menu to 
list the incoming e-mail, the sender's address is shown as "to: 
yky356@....".  I found that if the sender's address shows up only in the 
first line of the header and nowhere else, PINE has the problem of 
figuring out sender's address. If, however, there is another "From:.." 
one or two lines above the "To:.." line, then PINE has no problem 
figuring out sender's address. Why?

Hi,

	This is pine related.....sort of....

	We are working on a project in China and need a popd that runs
on SCO Unix.  The person working on the project saying:

I next got the ipopd package which comes with pine (imapd-3.6-beta from
ftp.cac.washington.edu). This package is comprehensive (3.5 MB of source) and
has a makefile entry for sco.

Unfortunately, it seems to be missing a crypt library required for passwords.
Also, its pop-2 daemon doesn't recognize VistaMAIL's USER message. Is this
right? My understanding was that VistaMAIL is pop-2.

	So, does anyone have a compiled popd for SCO?  Or, I believe
there is an International replacement for the SCO crypt library.

	Any help would be greatly appreciated.

	Thanks....

Your problem comes from the fact that SCO does not ship ANY type of crypt
library with their system, because they do not known in advance if the 
software will be sold inside the U.S.A. or outside of it.

So, as I understand it, you'll have to ask them for this library and
depending on your whereabouts you will get either the U.S. domestic version
(including the DES decrypt calls) or the International version (crypt only).
Unfortunately, you'll only notice the missing crypt libraries at the 
moment you want to compile an important piece of software, right?

I wonder why SCO cannot ALWAYS ship an International crypt-only library and
allow U.S. customers to upgrade to the full-blown version. Is that also 
against U.S. Government policies?

> 	So, does anyone have a compiled popd for SCO?

Actually, there IS a complete popd package for SCO (installable with 
custom and everything). It can be found on ftp.sco.com in the TLS 
directory. Look for files beginning with tls049*. If you cannot get to these
files I can mail you a copy.

Keep in mind that this is a regular POP3 server and that is has nothing 
to do with IMAP (though that didn't seem to be what you were asking for).

I hope that this will do it ;-)

My work group, runs on HP-UX 9.07, with ELM (70.85) and PINE (3.91).
When any of my colleagues post an email from ELM, the first paragraph
(text followed by two or more carriage returns) is replaced with the
prompt: 

Parts/attachments:
   1   Shown  273 bytes  Message
   1.1 Shown    7 lines  Text
----------------------------------------


  [ Part 1: "Included Message" ]

To see the "Included Message", I have to work a few layers down through
the ViewAttach functionality.  A faster way to see it is to select (R)espond
and then (C)ancel when I'm finished reading, but that is neither elegant
nor convenient.  Other colleagues who use mh (or other MUAs) don't have
this problem.

What's going on?  Is there anything I can do to fix it?

Message-Id: <47q1pa$9nb@news1.mpcs.com>

Subject says it all, the content type of the 8.7.x bounce reports gives
pine 3.91 the willies (crashes pine in fact, when accidentally calling up 
the attachment viewer).  

Is it possible to coerce sendmail without opening it up into using the old
MIME format so as to retain the ethical benefit of having the message text
off in an attachment?

Yes, I've tried that, but I want to be able to use the reply function to 
automatically put in all the email addresses into the header of the 
reply.  I know I can then delete the note below and include an expunged 
copy of the note, but its not exactly user friendly.

Thanks, Daniel

	Thanks for all the wonderful information!  Now the only problem
is I stupidly forgot to mention that I need a pop2 server.  :-( :-(

	I hope my only recourse is *not* to attempt to get the crypt

I suspect you have a malformed MIME-gram... probably the
"Mime-Version: 1.0" header is missing.

If that's the case, you can either save the message to a folder and
manually edit it to add the above header, then use Pine to read it, or you
can try using CMU's munpack program on it, which I think will try to
figure things out even if the MIME header is missing.

The 'problem' from your point of view is that Pine is only looking at the 
"From: " address.  mail is either only looking at the "From " address or 
is looking at both the "From " and "From: " addresses.  (The ':' is _very_ 
significant.)  The debate as to whether this is a bug or feature is left 
up to others.

The "From " line has a very specific format and is what determines where 
each message begins as they are stored (in Berkeley mail format, that is) 
as one long file, one message immediately after the other.*  The "From " 
line is also useful for determining the true mailer of the message as 
that line is added by the first system handling the message, and short of 
recompiling sendmail (or its equiv.), cannot be altered by the user (at 
least not easily).  The "From: " line has a much looser format, and can 
much more easily be changed by the user to reflect different e-mail 
addresses and user names.

*-This is why whenever a line begins with "From " (without the quotes), 
you will see it as ">From " (again, without the quotes)...this is to 
prevent the mail client from getting confused and thinking a new message 
has begun when, in fact, it is just a regular line in the message body.

As far as I know (I haven't specifically looked up the relevant RFCs), 
the "From: " header is required for a properly formatted e-mail 
message, so I would argue that you are just seeing a side-affect of 
receiving mail from a non-standard mail program.

The "From MARIA..." line is *NOT* part of the RFC-822 header set.
It is a message separator line used in some, but by no means all, mailbox
formats.  This is out-of-band information that is not part of the actual
message, and depending on the system, is often unreliable or unobtainable.

For Pine to know who the message is from, the message must have a valid
RFC-822 "From: " header (that's the one with the colon).

The absence of the 822 From: suggests a bug or misconfiguration of the
MUA or mail transport software at the originating site, although in cases
where UUCP is involved, I believe it often falls to the receiving MTA to
fix the messages before storing them in the incoming mail spool.

Unfortunately Pine 3.91 and below do not allow you to mail messages
from the command line so I don't think you'll be able to do this.
(Pine folks: Will 3.92 be able to do this type of thing?)

What I do if I want to mail a news message to someone in my addressbook
is bounce it to my email address (using "|/usr/bin/mail nancym@ii.com")
and then forward the message from Pine.

Good luck,
Nancy

I notice that Netscape v2b2 expects the POP server to have support for
an optional command called UIDL in order to "leave mail on server" (in
fact, I had to switch my Mac off at the wall to prevent it from
deleting all the mail from the server when Netscape found that the UIDL
command didn't exist).  Therefore it would be quite convenient if the
UIDL command, documented in RFC1725, could be added to the ipop3d
client shipped with imap-3.5 or -3.6.

On our work system, if you use ELM to send someone a message, the From
line looks like:

**From sgupta Wed Dec 15 1996 [etc]

except without the two astericks (I just added those to prevent
confusion). Pine ignores this From line and the message appears to
come from a mysterious unknown user. While this is cute for roughly 10
seconds, it can also be quite annoying ("hey, why are you sending me
anonymous mail and then signing it?") especially since the Reply
command doesn't work properly ("no valid receipients for this message"
or whatever).

So, the answer to your question is: "Use ELM and hope the receiver
uses Pine"... but my question is: "OK, it's cute.. now, how do I get
around it?"

Nancy,
3.92 will still require interactive involvement to send a message.

 ELM, for some wacky reason is making the Content-Type of the top-level
 message "Message/rfc822".. This is really bizarre!  RFC 1521 states 
 that Message/rfc822 is for encapsulated messages. text/plain seems to
 be a much better choice for the toplevel content-type.

Subject: POSSIBLE TO RESTORE LOST PINE FOLDERS?
Message-Id: <pliskerDHpwDB.Ir7@netcom.com>
Date: Wed, 8 Nov 1995 09:15:10 GMT

A little while ago I was deleting files from my home directory. In the 
middle of this I got disconnected. This has been happening for DAYS now 
on Netcom (when you are lucky enough to be able to log in). They just say 
"sorry if this caused you any inconvenience"). Or it is so S-L-O-W that I 
might as well be using a 150 baud modem.

When I was finally able to log on again I was going to use Pine to 
compose a letter of complaint to support@netcom but when I got into Pine 
I discovered to my horror that ALL my folders were GONE (except INBOX).
I called netcom Tech support and they told me they COULD do a restore but 
they would not do so unless I can prove it's their fault which frankly I 
can't say for sure whether it is or not. All I know is these folders are 
my life and I need the info contained within. Can anyone offer any 
suggestions whether it's technical advice or how I can lean on netcom to 
do me the favor of a restore?

All I know is I am getting really fed up with having to put up with their 
technical difficulties and even though this one MIGHT be my fault I plan 
to switch providers soon. When I called tech support at midnight I had to 
wait 20 minutes to be told no. They were probably swamped with calls from 
other Netcom subscribers who have been unable to log on or stay logged on 
if they are fortunate to connect.

The command structure and the commands recognized by an IMAP server are
detailed in RFC 1730 (with additional information in RFCs 1731, 1732, and
1733). These RFCs are included with the source of the University of
Washington's IMAP server, in the Doc subdirectory. In particular, each
command sent to the server needs a four character
identifier, a command tag, and the necessary arguments. A minimal set of
commands to test if the IMAP server is working is as follows. (Here words in
all caps are the command tags, and lower case are the arguments you need to
supply. The exception is the INBOX argument, which is a special name
designating
the user's default mailbox.)

a000 LOGIN username password
a001 SELECT INBOX
a002 LIST
a003 FETCH 1 RFC822
a004 LOGOUT

Hi. I'm trying to install PC Pine and running into some problems.
The IMAP server at the other end has also just been installed; it's
the IMAP4 server from the University of Washington. I used telnet to
connect directly to port 143 on the host, and I can do everything I'm
supposed to be able to do interactively, so I believe the IMAP server
is okay.

One of the PCs is running Novell Netware 3.12. I installed pcpine_n onto
the machine. It never manages to connect to the server; I always get a
host unknown message. This even happens if I use the dotted-quad numeric
IP address of the host instead of the domain name.

The second PC is running a newer version of Novell Netware. (4.02??)
On this PC, pcpine_n is able to connect to the IMAP server and it tells
me the correct number of available messages. Unfortunately, it insists
that all of the messages have completely blank subject lines and message
bodies. That makes it easy to read my mail in a hurry, but it just happens
to be incorrect behavior.

Does anyone have any idea what I'm doing wrong?

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to get my mail on my server and reading it on my local Linux box at home.  I used poplient and got this error message
# message in folder
popclient: openmailpipe: exec: No such file or directory
reading message #.

I'm assuming that if popclient works, I could just open pine on my linux box and read and write messages.

Any help on this is appreciated

Peter,
The only *tiny* glimmer of hope I might offer is to poke around in your
home directory to see if you have a mail directory somewhere with your
missing folders in it.  It's a longshot, but there is a small chance that
just your Pine config file got trashed, and maybe they are really there
but Pine just doesn't know where to look for them.  If the folders are
really gone, you are at Netcom's mercy, and it is hard to imagine anything
that you could do from within Pine that would trash a whole bunch of
folders at once.

I realize it's bad form to follow up your own posting, but I've discovered
some additional information about my problem. Readers of the first installment
will recall that I'm trying to get the latest version of PC Pine (acquired
from the University of Washington in the form of the file pcpine_n.zip) to
work on a PC running Novell Netware 4.2. The symptom I described previously
is that Pine conects to the remote IMAP server, lists the correct number of
messages, but they have blank headers and bodies. While trying to figure out
what was going on, I discovered:

If new mail arrives while PC Pine is running, then suddenly the mail becomes
visible. If the folder is open at the time, then only the new messages are
visible. If the folder is closed but Pine is running, then opening the folder
will make all the mail visible, both new and old.

Has anybody seen this before? Does anyone have any idea what's happening?

Thanks again,

Kevin <krc@math.umd.edu>

Subject: How to convert RMAIL folders to Pine
Date: 8 Nov 1995 23:39:13 GMT
Message-Id: <47rf31$18f@news.bu.edu>

Piners,
    I'm thinking about switching from emacs RMAIL to PINE, but I have many
many megabytes of mail saved in RMAIL format. Does anyone know how to
convert RMAIL mailboxes back to unix native mailboxes WITHOUT going through
every single message in the mailbox and re-saving it to a new mailbox?

Also, in the ~/mail directory that PINE creates, is it possible to have
subdirectories of additional mailboxes so that you can sort your mailboxes?
This is possible with RMAIL, but my short test of PINE did not convince me
that it would recognize mailboxes saved in subdirectories of ~/mail.

                Thanks,
                        Anders

    It may not be necessary to recompile Pine, *IF* you are using Unix 
Pine.  I use the shell script below to change the '>' characters to 
something else when I wish to.  This technique works provided you are not 
already using the alternate editor feature of Pine.  To use it, go into 
Config and enable-alternate-editor.  For the alternate editor, specify 
the shell script.  Then just invoke Ctrl-_ to make the change.  I am not 
a sed expert (I got this from someone else), but I suppose you could 
easily change it to _delete_ the leading '>' rather than just substitute 
for it.

    If you are using Pine 3.91, from the Main Menu go into Setup and 
Config.  Scroll down to customized-hdrs: and add the field you want.

Or just leave the editor setting blank, i.e.:

editor=

And then when you do ^_ you can specify whatever script or editor

Anders,
True hierarchical folder support is not yet available (and won't be in
3.92) but is definitely planned for sometime next year.

In the meantime, you *can* create folder collections which just happen to
be subdirectories of other folder collections, or just set them up as
parallel directories.

The UIDL command is supported in the ipop3d client in imap-4.  It is
impossible to add it to imap-3.x since imap-3.x does not have UID support.

Unfortunately, Pine 3.92 will go out with imap-3.6, because it would
further delay the already too-long delayed release of 3.92 to upgrade it
to imap-4 at this late date (there are *major* interface changes in
imap-4).  But 3.92 should be the last release that uses any imap-3.x
version.  In fact, the only reason why imap-3.6 exists at all is for Pine;
imap-3.6 will die once Pine no longer needs it.

You can run the imapd and ipop[23]d servers from imap-4 with Pine 3.91 and
Pine 3.92.  In fact, we do that ourselves on several of our servers.  We
still run the imap-3.6 imapd on our main server, but only because we want
to make sure that it still works and doesn't succumb to software rot. ;-)

I think I have figured this mystery out.

Since ELM is claiming that the BODY text of your message is itself another
 message, PINE (rightly so) is expecting your message to contain headers 
like To:, From: Date: and so on. The first paragraph of your coworker's
 message is considered to be the "header" part. It doesn't contain any 
headers PINE knows about, but that's OK (says pine), i'll just throw the
 unknown headers out.

I did an experiment on the mail that was sent to me. I put 
"\n\nFoo: bar\n\n" between the "real" headers and the text of his message.
 (\n is return, of course).  Then, the message appeared correctly and the
 Foo:bar was nowhere in sight.  If PINE had a "show full headers" command
 for encapsulated messages, well then it would work. Like you said,
 hitting reply is the only way to view it.

So to summarize:
 * this is a bug in HP's ELM -- it's putting the wrong content-type on messages.
 * pine seems to be working correctly -- although a "show full headers on
enclosures" command would be nice.
 * As a workaround, have your coworker hit return a couple of times so as
to leave some blank lines at the top of all messages he sends out.  This
seems to make pine behave correctly.

cc is a link to gcc. The two occurences of rename in the gcc includes are:

/usr/GNU/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.4/2.7.0/include/stdio.h:extern int     rename(const char *, const char *);
/usr/GNU/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.4/2.7.0/include/unistd.h:extern int rename(const char *, const char *);

which look consistent to me. I've tried looking for the prototype for
rename in the pine code but got lost in a twisty maze of OS dependent
files. Any clues?

hi guys,

I have some questions about pine:

1) what is the format of the command that I have to put in my config file?

Usually from my unix shell, I type:
text2ps (filename) | lpr -P (printer name)    --- to print a text file
lpr -P (printer name) (filename)

2) How can I change this sentence which is by default in my reply message:

On Nov 8, un fleuron du nil wrote,

I saw a lot of people who changed their reply sentences. So I want to change 
this sentence.  Is it possible to do that with pine ???? 

3) I will explain the situation: In my addressbook, I have a lot of 
people who are related to different kind of groups.  What I want to do is: 
If i receive a mail from "person A", and i want to save his mail.  I want 
it to saved automatically in "folder newsgroup" instead of beiing saved 
in "folder saved-messages".  If I receive a mail from "person B", i 
wanted to be saved in "folder pine-stuff" instead of beiing saved in 
"folder saved-messages"  .... etc .....

"person A"  and "person B"  are in my addressbook file.  How can I 
configure that so it does it automatically instead of doing each time 
manually for each mail.

thanx in advance
rick.

Exporting is fine, but it creates a  garbage file you have to remember
to delete afterwards (or even  worse -- to exit  pine, delete it,  and
come   back).   I personally prefer    the method of  (F)orwarding the
message, entering    the  person's email  address,  then  removing the
unwanted crap on  top  by hitting  ^K  a few  times.  I  have very bad
memory and I hate checking for temp files.

The short answer to your question is that Elm and/or the mailer on your
system is misconfigured.

The message delimiter line which starts with "From " is not a From: header
line.  Furthermore, a From: line is required in all RFC-822 messages.

Elm on your system is configured not to generate a From: header,
apparently assuming that the mailer will insert the missing header.  The
mailer on your system is configured not to generate missing From: headers,
apparently assuming that no user mail programs would neglect to write
proper From: headers.  Correcting either of these behaviors will fix the
problem.

Greetings!

   I'm having some difficulty compiling Pine 3.91 on my Solaris2.4 x86
machine.  I'm using Solaris' cc.  Pico, imap, etc. all compile fine but I get
multiple 'idnetifyer redeclared' errors in addrbook.c.  For example:

"usr/include/stdlib/h", line 142: indentifyer redeclared: getsubopt
   current:    function(pointer to pointer to char,
                        pointer to pointer to char,
                        pointer to pointer to char) returning int
   previous:   function(pointer to pointer to char,
                        pointer to const pointer to char,
                        pointer to pointer to char) returning int :

   "usr/include/stdio.h", line 285


   The other errors are similar, just different function names (rename, etc.)

   Anyone know what's up?

   TIA!

Hi folks!

Sorry if I make the old question - I am new to Pine community.

i am using Pine (3.91) for some time and find it really nice. But one thing:
Pine seems to always encode 8bit text in qouted-printable.

The problem is, not all are using MIME (I have friends with FIDO 
Mailboxes - how they are supposed to read it?) As Internet now-a-days is 
more or less 8bit clean, is it possible to just send clean 8bit text?

To make it clear - I have to write in Russian, which is _all_ 8 bit so 
the text in QP is _totally_ unreadable -:)

It would be nice to do it on per-message basis, or at least just switch it 
off completely.

Thanks for any hint

Even if you are able to talk them into doing a restore for you, this
is an unacceptable response from them (unless you regularly have them
do restores) and if I were you, I'd start making plans to switch
providers.  About a month ago I accidentally deleted a couple files
from my account at halcyon.com and I asked them to restore them for
me.  They did it quickly and professionally without any complaints
or chastisement.

There are plenty of good providers out there and there's no reason
to put up with this type of customer "support."  

Good luck,
Nancy

Most web browsers can transfer files.  Just give the URL.
Or use ftp.  Better yet, get "ncftp" to do transfers.
Use a transfer program to get it...

Hi!  I am a new pine user and this may be a relatively simple question, although
I could not find the info I need at the washington site.  I would like to send
email and when it is read by the recipient, I would like the originator to be
notfied.  (just like registered mail of the postal system)  Can pine do this?
What type of flag or settings do I need.

Thanks,

Every mail can be sent with a Return-Receipt-To which will give you a return
mail when the receiving MTA has delivered the mail to the mailbox.
But there is no may to tell whether a person has read a mail.  Forget it!

Does somebody know a method to discard automatically certain mail ?
On our site, we receive a lot of "undesirable" messages.
It is possible to configure pine to eliminate these messages ?
(With or without response)
Any info would be great.

Martin,
Try "telnet cobra.unm.edu 143" and you will see that Cobra is not,
in fact, "IMAP compliant"...

As an example, I receive about 10 messages from one listserv that I would 
like to forward to my office email or a friend's email.  Is it possible 
to send all 10 at once, rather than individually forwarding them?  I can 
sort first by 'from' or 'subject' and that would place them all together

     When I'm in the "To" field of a header, and press ^T, Pine just says
[Yes].  I expected it to jump into my .addressbook and to then allow me to
insert an address. 

     Is there something I need to do in configure?

     I'm using Pine 3.91 on a Sun4.

     Thanks,

I am sending this question to two lists: AIX-L and Pine-Info.

Does anyone know what changes need to be made to allow the pine mail 
program to work properly in a restricted shell (Rsh) on an IBM RS6000 
running AIX 3.2?  I can get pine to receive e-mail, but not to send.
I have tried running pine in debug mode, but the debug log does not 
indicate that there are any problems, yet the mail is not delivered.

I can change to a different shell (ksh), then pine works fine.

Changing the user-domain from BugHunter.student.utwente.nl into
student.utwente.nl isn't a problem, just change the user-domain= line in
.pinerc

I am however unable to change the user-name, nothing in the .pinerc file
looks to be able to help me out nor does 'man pine'.

Any help would be grately appreciated.

Pine is acting up on me these days. Some mails come to me with a missing 
body and only a header. I have also observed < QUIT > appended to some 
messages I get where no such were there before. Any ideas what caused 
this to happen, and - before I forget - any remedies ?

    There seems to be a possible bug in Unix Pine 3.91.  Whenever I 
export a message to a file, the current date and time get appended to 
the first line, so that I have to edit out the trash.  Inconvenient.

    Pine by itself will not do this.  You have to use some other program 
which will preprocess the mail before Pine gets hold of it.  On Unix 
systems, procmail and (elm) filter are commonly used.  Nancy McGough has 
some good material on this on her World Wide Web pages, if you can get to 
them.  As a starting point, look at

        URL: http://www/jazzie.com/ii/internet/pine.html
        URL: http://www/best.com/~ii/internet/pine.html

Save all to a file.  Compress file.  Send file as an attachment.
Something like "gzip file | uuencode | mail address".
Only do this with people who know how to unpack a compressed file.

Must be a local problem with your site.  I've never noticed it.

These aliases and lots more info about Pine is available at my Pine

Or its mirror:

Please send me any suggestions and comments.
Also, if any knows where I could find a copy of the pine icon
that's used for PC Pine for Windows, please tell me - I'd like
to put it on my Pine page.

Thanks!

Multinet supports POP, not IMAP server. You should have IMAP server with either
PMDF of the public domain version available from VMS.HUJI.AC.IL. In the latter,
you need the 3.89 version (the 3.91 IMAP server was not modified yet to VMS).

We have fifty users out in the field with laptops.  I need to give these 
users access to Internet e-mail.  Inside, we use Pine 3.91 and have an 
Internet connection.  Pine is running on a Data General Aviion box.

Is it possible to load PC pine on the laptops and have the users dial

each field users and have a script automatically log them in and 
exchange mail and hangup.

Can anyone give me some suggestions on whether this can be done?  Thanks.

Where would I begin to look to determine the cause of failed deliveries to

Appreciate any pointers.

Hi,

Can anyone tell me where I can download an SGI compatible version of Pine
(compiled as a binary).  I checked the main Pine ftp site, but didn't find
any binaries that were compatible with SGI Irix. 

Thanks for any info.

If replying by e-mail, please respond to roon48@aol.com.

Yes it is possible.

You need to use the "Select" and "Apply" commands...

In Pine 3.91 go into the Setup (S) Configuration (C) screen.

Turn on the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature.

Return to the folder index.

Use the Select (;) command to choose the messages you want to operate on.

Use the Apply (A) command, followed by the command you want to apply to 
the selected messages.

(As an aside, you can also use the Zoom (Z) command to temporarily hide 
the other, unselected messages.  Another Zoom will display them again.)

It sounds like you are either using one of the pre-compiled binaries 
available on the Net, or are using a version compiled locally with the 
'-DDEBUG' C flag left in.

These default to producing the .pine.debug[1-4] files.

You can stop them from being generated by starting Pine with the '-d 0' 
command line option (it tells you this in the man page for Pine).

A better solution is to get the source code for Pine and recompile it 
without the '-DDEBUG' C flag.  This will cause the debug code to be 
omitted from the binary.

Yes it can.

You can find out some information by going to the Setup (S) Configuration 
(C) screen.  Put the cursor on the "inbox-path" item and ask for help 
(see the menu at the bottom of the screen).

This includes a reference of to additional help in the List Folders 
screen (Press "L" then ask for help with "?".  Either read through, or 
search for the string "Valid Folder Names" by typing "W Valid Folder Names".)

Nope, that just proves that you were in a different directory on each of

Sorry David, but it *DOES* happen sometimes for other unexplainable 
reasons, not always, and not always with the same folders or messages ... 
As near as I can figure out, it's not PINE doing this, it's the mail 
server or in my case as a dial-up pc to a unix server, possibly some 
noise in the phone line ???  I don't know, but it DOES happen.  G'Day.

I would like to have some information about appended files with the
E-mail. I have had an instance where I was sent a mail and along with it
was an unencoded .xls file. Now I would like to know how can I read this
Excel file. I tried to read directly through Excel but gave me in text
format only. 

So if you know please send the related info. 

Thanks

Asit

If you just put the header name, but no value for it, in the custom header
list, you can fill in the value at compose time, but if you don't, the
(empty) header will not be included in the message.

Is this not sufficient?

    Please provide more information.  Just what are you getting back that 
makes you think your mail is being returned?  Without more details, it 
might be almost impossible to answer your question.

We have a comparable setup, but we are using Kendra's UUPC (a UUCP 
implementation for DOS). We also want to use PC-Pine as the MUA, 
therefore I posted twice on this list. Unfortunately nobody gave a 
response until now. If somebody on this Pine list knows how to use 
PC-Pine with UUPC, please respond.

We like the setup with UUCP, because we don't have to setup interactive
accounts (logins) for each user. All PC's login anounymously through one
accountname (normally uucp or nuucp on Unix), and addressing is done by
assigning a name to each PC and the user of it. 

Is this that special and difficult, or are you all to shy to respond to a 
frendly Dutchman :-)

Cheers, Nico

Here is an excerpt from my FAQ on ysing Linux with my provider.


=====================================================================
5. Setting up pine
=====================================================================

You MUST use the popclient program first to read your mail from primenet 
and place it on your local hard drive. Then you can use pine to read and 
send replies.

First set up pine. Login as your personal name login and run pine for the
first time so it sets up some default files. Exit pine. 

Edit .pinerc and edit these lines:

        # Over-rides your full name from Unix password file.
        personal-name=FirstName LastName

        # Sets domain part of From: and local addresses in outgoing mail.
        user-domain=YOUR.ISP.com

        # List of SMTP servers for sending mail. 
        smtp-server=mailhost.YOUR-ISP.com

Next we will create a script called 'm' for running popclient to get our
mail and then running pine. You can copy this file and edit "USERNAME" and
"PASSWORD" to your ISP username and password, which can be different
than your password on your Linux system. But for simplistic reasons, your
username on your Linux system should be the same as your ISP
username. 

m:
------------------------ Cut here ----------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
if popclient -3 -p PASSWORD -o /var/spool/mail/USERNAME mailhost.YOUR.ISP.com
then
        pine
fi
------------------------ End here ----------------------

Now to get mail, simply type m. Of course you have to have already run 
dip and be connected to your ISP.

Hope this helps!

Best Regards, Keith...

Subject: Is it dangerous to remove lock files in /usr/mail??
Date: 10 Nov 95 15:33:15 GMT
Message-Id: <lara.816017595@cern04>



I understand that when a user logs out without first closing pine that a
lock file is created in /usr/mail.  Is this done because if you exit without
closing pine you have left your mailbox open and therefore unsecure and
the lock basically prevents anything from being done to this unsecure mailbox?

What would happen if I as a system administrator were to remove all lock files
regularly during the day so our users that logged off without closing pine
could still receive mail?  Is this a good idea?  I understand that the lock
files are there for a reason, but once they are removed than the users mail 
works fine again so I don't see what the problem would be with removing them
regularly (as root).

I would appreciate any feeback.

thanks,
Lara

Are you sure the file is NOT encoded?

Excel files are not 7bit, so they should be encoded for mailing. If not they may come distorted. Ask 
your sender for the filesize and check with your email, if they differ use encoding for mailing.

OR: Perhaps you are using an older version of excel than the sender?
    Then you Excel don't knwo how to handle the newer file.

Ciao,
 Michael

PS: If you really have to use a different From field you have to recompile PINE.
    There is a Flag for allowing this, I've forgotten where, search for FROM in the os-dependent
    files.

Subject: Are You Preapred?



The Problem:

                Most companies require a pre-employment drug test.
                If you are seeking employment, on probation, or in
                the military, you will have to take a drug test.  

Another Problem:

		Eating the wrong breakfast, or using certain over-the-
                counter pain relievers will falsely identify you as 
                a drug user.

The Real Problem:

		Public and private employers spend 1.2 billion
		dollars each year (1992 figures) on drug tests that 
		are unreliable and inaccurate.  Even hard working
		employees that do not use drugs are at risk.



                                 The Solution:

                       ================================ 


Know the Facts.

        Know what foods and over the counter medicines are routinely 
        mistaken for common illegal drugs.  Simply eating a poppy seed 
        bagel before a drug test can identify you as an opiate user.

        Know how long different illicit drugs can be detected in your 
        system.  Marijuana can be detected for more than a month if 
        nothing is done to conceal its use.

        Know the different types of drug tests, especially the ones
        you are likely to face.  GC/MS tests are almost impossible to 
        beat, but are seldom used.  The more common EMIT test is 
        much easier to fool -- if you know how.

Be Prepared!

        Know when the test is coming.  Do not use illicit drugs, or 
        ingest cross-reactive substances before the test.

        Clean your system of drug metabolites and cross-reactive 
        substances.

        Drink plenty of water and urinate as often as possible before 
        the test.  Do NOT give them your first urine of the day!

Use Clean 'n Clear.

The problem is that there is a define of "const" --> ""
ie. every occurence of the string "const" will be substituted by an empty
string. This definition is inconsistently applied.

I have a patch to PINE3.91 that works for me (also GCC 2.7.0 and
Solaris 2.4). Some things to think about if you try using it:

  1) I don't know if I have done this "the right way". Because of the
     strange way the makefiles are organized in 3.91 I think it is
     very difficult to make a change in *one* place and have if
     affect all other parts of the PINE source tree.

  2) I didn't have "cc" as a link to "gcc". Instead I used:

         ./build sol CC=gcc

     I assume both ways work.


The patch follows below.

I suspect that this has nothing to do with folder collections.
More likely your VMS host is not running an IMAPD process.
Are you its sysadmin?  If not, you'll need to contact that person.
I do not believe that Multinet itself provides an IMAPD server:
there is no mention of such a thing in the Multinet manual that I
just looked into.
 
There is a VMS-ported IMAPD in Yehavi's "free" version of PINE
at VMS.HUJI.AC.IL in directory LOCAL.  I haven't run the IMAPD myself
but I think it works OK and is compatible with Multinet.
(I do run his PINE client successfully with Multinet, and I know
that it can also work with UCX).
 
>Has anybody succesfully connected to a VMS host?
 
I'm certain that some have.  Yehavi would not be offering his
IMAPD if it did not work, that seems sure.  If you try
telnet vms.huji.ac.il/port=imap
it will connect and respond appropriately with "IMAP2bis" service.
Of course I cannot go further because I do not have an account there.
If I try the same experiment to the host that you named, I get
"connection refused".  I feel sure that your host is not yet running
an IMAPD process.  The other explanation could be that you have a
network firewall that is blocking this port number.
 
The folder-collections question comes later.  I don't know the answer,
but perhaps you will find appropriate information with the IMAPD
software.  NEWMAIL is not a folder collection: it is a folder.
My guess, but it is only a guess, is that your folder collection
would be {cobra.unm.edu}mail/[]
 
Probably the PMDF package also includes a version of IMAPD server.

The problem is  that the newsgroups that you are subscribed to are
listed in one .newsrc file.  You would need something like a batch
file (or shell script)  to handle switching between .newsrc files (ie
copy .newsrc-one_NNTP_server to .newsrc and then copy back when quit
out) before going into Pine configured to the NNTP server of your
choice.

I don't know how to handle shell scripts myself but that seems a way
to do it.

Readers,

I was wondering if it is possible to save a message onto your floppy 
disk? If so I would be very greatful if some one could send a list of 
basic instructions of how to do this. At the moment I have only saved 
them using the command in Pine, I beleive you have to enter into Unix to 
save files onto you floppy disk. If anyone can spare there time to 
respond I would be most grateful, thanks.

Find the unix directory where the measage is saved. enter the send file 
command from the shell prompt. this would be sz <filename> for z modem or 
sx <filename> for x modem

Our LAN has a Telebit LCS communications server and uses a
PCAnywhere version 4.5 comm software.

The problem description is when using Pine (Internet Email) the
screen scrolls up one line and initiates a hard return.  It is
virtually impossible to read Email or compose a message.

1.  Is there a solution to this problem and still use PCAnywhere?

2.  Is there anyway to remove the PCAnywere status bar from the
bottom of the screen?

Hi,

I'm using Pine 3.90 for SGI Irix 5.2.  My mail folder has become damaged,
and I'm not sure how to repair it.  The Pine FAQ told me to make sure the
first line in the file begins with the word, "From".  I did make sure of
that, but it still doesn't work.  When I launch pine it says that it
cannot open my mail folder.

Any suggestions?  If replying by e-mail, please respond to roon48@aol.com.

Thanks a lot,

I am wondering how to create a "signature" that will be tacked on to the 
end of all my out-going e-mail messages.  (The one you see below is 
currently saved in my Scrapbook and cut-and-pasted every time I send an 
e-mail.)

Thanks in advance for any help!

	Simply make a file called .signature and put whatever you like as 
your signature in it for the contents...

	Is there any way, or any file that will tell me if I have new mail 
waiting in Pine, that I can put in my .login file?  The problem is that 
they are using an IMAP server, so I can't use the unix command newmail, 
or mailfrom, because the mail isn't actually stored in my directory.  Is 
there any way that this can be done, or does IMAP make it impossible?

We have sparc-sun-solaris2.4 running pine3.91 using a precompiled
binary (compiled for solaris2.2; we did not find any for solaris2.4).
After composing a message I type ^X; pine writes
Writing Fcc...
and hangs forever.
So the sys adm set the apropriate fcc variable (in pine.config) 
to "" to remedy the
problem. But the same problem occurs when i try to postpone a message:
I type ^O and pine hangs with the message
Writing postponed message...
Again, this can be repaired by setting the postponed-message variable
to "" but then I cannot postpone messages!!

Any idea what could be wrong?

Thanks

Mate
Ps.: Of course, there could be other features of pine which do not work 
because of this "locking up" , but this is what we noticed in the first week

Are you sure it's an Alpha ? An older VAX (MicroVAX I or 11/780) might 
have problems running more recent software but most properly configured 
VAXen can run anything you need to access the internet, including TCP/IP 
& Pine & NNTP

Pine runs on lots of VMS systems... ALpha & VAX...

There's a port to VMS from Innosoft (included with their PMDF package) 
that'll work iwithout an IMAP server on the same machine even.

& the above mentioned pd port...

If you're on cobra.unm.edu try the above using VMS syntax:

telnet/port=143 cobra.unm.edu

In addition, if you 

telnet/port=25 cobra.unm.edu

You'll see that that machine is using TGV's Multinet SMTP package. 
Multinet doesn't include an IMAP server, just POP(2&3). If it had been 
running Innosoft's PMDF e-mail product which does include an IMAP server 
you might have a chance. There is a port of an IMAP server to VMS but it 
obviously isn't running on that machine.

All the time... you just need the correct server running on the machine.

Message-Id: <483ono$47p@tusk.lm.com>

I've started receiving mail containing two parts.  The first part is
usually a few lines of ASCII text.  The second part is about 2.9KB
long and PINE 3.91 identifies it as application/MS-TNEF.  The only
thing I can do with the second part is save it to a file.  The headers
show that the sender is using Microsoft Mail.  I asked someone who
sent me such a message what he was doing.  He was a computer novice
and didn't know.  Several messages from him had the attachment and
several didn't.  He didn't indicate he had done anything different
when sending the mail without the attachment.

So, what is the MS-TNEF attachment?  Why is it called an application?
What causes it to be sent?  Is it necessary?  If not, how can it be
avoided?

Thanks,
Barry

In particularly I would like to know if the port assumes A/UX 3.0.x or

It seems not to work with my 3.0.2.

Or while viewing the message in pine, you should be able to just
pipe it to sz, e.g.:

  |sz

I haven't tried this so I'm not sure it works but I'm curious.
Does anyone know if it works?

Or even better would be if Pine could use IMAP to access the .newsrc
on the corresponding server.  Pine developers - is that in the plans
for some version of Pine?

WinBiff 3.2 has been released, and is available at

  http://www.tucows.com/files/wnbff32.zip

or

  ftp://ftp.tucows.com/tucows/wnbff32.zip

or in the CompuServe NOVUSER forum as WNBFF32.ZIP.


WinBiff is a Windows email notification program that works with a number
of different mail agents, including Pegasus Mail, Eudora for Windows,
cc:Mail, MS Mail, and new in this release, Lotus Notes.  WinBiff also
is a POP3 and IMAP client under WinSock.

This version also adds a "Hide icon" feature that hides the icon
when there's no mail.  The "Unread mail only" option now works
with Pegasus Mail and POP3.

Enjoy!

Pine does something VERY non-standard and changes it to (When you view 
it) Reply to: which is uncorrect, as there CANNOT be spaces in headers.

Hi,
	I am using my pine shell account and periodically would like to 
print out an e-mail reply. I have gone into the setup command and hit P 
for printer, then attached to ansi (1). All I get are blank sheets of 
paper altho the screen says "printing attached to ansi". Please let me 
know what I am doing wrong. I am using an IBM PC clone 486/100 ande 
either an IBM Proprinter or an HP Laserjet 4MP. Thanks a million.

Are you using a postscript print driver?  If so, change it to use
a non-postscript print driver, e.g., I use `HP Laserjet 4/4M on LPT1'
and then try printing with `attached-to-ansi'.

Good luck,
Nancy

    Try making it "Reply-to:" with a hyphen instead of "Reply to:" with a

    It is not a permanent solution, but when you view the first message, 
press 'H' for "full headers."  Full headers should be on for all messages 
for the rest of that session unless you turn it off again.  Be aware, 
however, that full headers will show a _lot_ more than just Organization.

Nancy,
Pine can already read news via IMAP, but this requires that:
 o you have an account on the News server (to store your.newsrc in).
 o the news server is running an IMAP daemon.

There has also been discussion of having the IMAP server act as a proxy
nntp client, so that an existing news-only server could be used via an
IMAP server.  I believe Esys Inc may have done this already, but it's not
in the UW imap distribution at this time.

The general problem of location-independent access to network application
support files (e.g.  .newsrc, .pinerc, .signature, .addressbook,
.vacation, procmail rule files, web bookmark files, etc) is very
important, and several groups are working on it.  Our challenge will be to
converge on a single approach.

Also note that custom headers don't show up in the composer automatically.
You need to hit ^R to see them *unless* they are also in the default
header list.

No, unless you want to see *full* headers all the time...
But 3.92 will allow you to specify which headers will be displayed in View
Message.

5) allow mass subscription to newsgroups.  it's a hell on earth to type

A line beginning with "From " is necessary but not sufficient.
Try copying the separator line from the beginning of a subsequent
message to the beginning of the file (and deleting the mal-formed one).

I can make a version compiled for 302 available on request. I would only

can I take a binary file divided in two parts. If I SAVE it there appears 
the two parts, not the whole file. So, how can i get the two parts together?

	Thank you very much, and sorry about my english.

   How do I look through a Pine folder (containing headers and messages

   I know the end of each header is marked as a blank line, but you can't 
   mark the start of a header like this because the message itself could 
   contain blank lines.

A standard Berkeley style folder delineates messages by a "From " line
following a blank line.  Reading from the pine Tech Notes:

Berkeley Mail Format
     This format comes to us from the ancient UNIX
     mail  program,  /bin/mail.   (Note  that this
     doesn't have anything to  do  with  Berkeley,
     but  we call it the Berkeley mail file format
     anyway.) This program was  actually  used  to
     interactively  read  mail at one time, and is
     still used  on  many  systems  as  the  local
     delivery agent.  In the Berkeley mail format,
     a folder is a simple text file.  Each message
     (including  the  first)  must  start  with  a
     separator line which takes approximately  the
     form:

     From juser@u.example.edu  Wed Aug 11 14:32:33 1993


     Each  message  ends  with  two  blank  lines.   *
     There  are  actually several different varia-
     tions in the date part of the string,  twenty
     at  last  count.

* I think this should read "two newlines" -- i.e. _one_ blank line.

Hope this helps,

I' dlike to change the e-mail address to reply to when I'm posting via trn. From home I 
usually use Netscape, but sometimes I need/have to use trn from the unix shell to 
read/post news groups. When I do this me e-mail address is sent as the defualt that has 
been set by my ISP. I would like to change it to a different one. Is it possibel ?

Would really appreciate an e-mailed reply.

It's probably a lot easier that way.
But it also takes a hell of a time to code such a thing.
I suggest you simple edit your .newsrc and all them.

I use "nngrep -a sci.all > .newsrc" to do that.
One of the many reasons why I use "nn".  :-)

Message-Id: <478dap$r6@news.internetmci.com>

Is there any way in pine to search the body of the messages for a text
string?  "W" only searches the info that's in the index.  The only way
I know to do it is to leave pine and grep through the mail directory or
mail folder.

If not, can I add this as yet-another requirement?  I'd like to be able 
to specify to search subjects only, search all mail (including the body of the
message) in a folder, and search all mail (including body) of a folder
collection.

I am sure trn gives you a setup file for specifying your email address.
That's usually the case when the default is used.  RTFM!

Btw, if your problem is with trn then why do you post to comp.mail.pine?

A not to all authors of newsreaders:
Please add a line which does not allow posting if the default values such as
domain name, user name, email address etc match the given dummy values.
It's a nuisance if the From: line reads "user@DOMAIN_NAME (YOUR NAME)".

There is now an HTML version of the Pine Technical Notes available at

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/
aka	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/

These are essentially a direct conversion of the Pine Technical Notes
from TROFF version in the Pine 3.91 release, so there is no new
information, but it should be easier to read for those with web
browsers.  Please contact the Pine Information Center Maintainer

Before I have a nervous breakdown, I thought that you might be able to 
shed some light on my persistent problem as follows:

After asking for a printout of my mail from PINE (by the 'Y' command) I 
find that usually nothing will print until AFTER after I exit my terminal 
program where I was using PINE. I feel that it must have something 
to do with one of the following issues:

	1. Some setting in my Windows Print Manager
	2. Some setting in my .pinerc file
	3. Some parameter setting in WIN.INI file

Other times I may begin to print while still in PINE but only half a page 
prints out and there is a generation of garbage which includes the 
command structure at the bottom of the PINE page.

Yhukkkkk!!! Any words of wisdom to soothe my aggravation? 

Many thanks!			 Sol James	 sjames@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us

Subject: Disk quotas and IMAP clients?
Date: Mon, 13 Nov 1995 17:59:50 GMT
Message-Id: <488169$p6c@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

In looking at Windows and Mac IMAP clients, we have encountered a
major problem with at least one product.

We have a disk quota imposed for user home directories (where the mail
folders are located) and no disk quota for /var/spool/mail (home of
INBOX).

With one Windows IMAP client that we are looking at, when a user that
has hit their disk quota on their home directory moves a mail message
from their INBOX into a folder, they get no error/warning message,
everything looks like the mail message has moved over, it gets deleted
from the INBOX, but since they have no disk space available in their
home directory, it goes into "ye ol' bit bucket" and is GONE from this
(and any other discernible) dimension.

What have been the experiences of others out there with IMAP clients
for Windows and Macs in terms of handling system errors like this?
Anyone else encountered this with other clients?  Are there other
sites that have disk quotas where the folders are stored?  Are there
clients that DO properly return the appropriate error message in a
case like this?

Thanks in advance.

 I thought this had been recently answered. The method is:
  ";" -- for "Select"
  "T" -- for "Text"
  "A" -- for All of message text.

  You can then "Zoom" to the selected messages, or use "A" and "S" to 
save them to a folder, and so forth.

This is incorrect.  If Pine crashes while it is reading the folder or
performing an update, a lock file will be left behind.  That is the only
time.  The lock files are created only when an actual file access is done,
and are removed immediately afterwards.

Lock files should be timed out (and ignored) by Pine and other mail
software after they are 5 minutes old.

If this is not happening, then something is wrong on your system and it
needs to be investigated and/or reported to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.

It's there now, and has been for some time.  In IMAP2, open
	*{imapserver}newsgroup
in IMAP4, open
	{imapserver}#news.newsgroup

Note that the IMAP server has to have a local news spool, and of course
you need an account on the server.

We just installed a stand alone email server and we are accessing
it via pine/imap.  A few users are able to access the remote server
without giving their password.  It would be great if I could set it
up so that nobody had to give their password.  How does security for
imap work?  Can I configure the email server to trust a particular host
so that users don't have to give the login a passwd again to read their
mail?

I delete them regularly on our Silicon Graphics machine. If I didn't they
would number in the hundreds after a month or two. The other poster may
have been correct about how pine deals with these lock files, but my
experience has been along the same lines as yours. From my end, it *looks*
exectly like it leaves the lock files behind when a user logs out without
stopping pine or its window first, or hangs up the modem from his end
without quitting pine. On our machine, (once we did a few small code
changes -- 1 or 2 lines) the program has been rock stable, almost never
hanging up or crashing. Noone whose lock file I have deleted has
ever complained.

Do you know where your INBOX is stored? It is often in /usr/mail or 
/usr/spool/mail somewhere. Once you know that, you could do something 
simple like add to your .login something like

echo "You have "`grep -c 'Message-Id: ' $MAIL`" mail messages."

where $MAIL is the path to your INBOX (e.g. "/usr/mail/$user" or 
"/nfs/some-machine-name/usr/mail/jweinrib"). This should give you a message 
like 

You have 0 mail messages.

or

You have 65 mail messages.

or 

whatever.

When used along with pine's read-message-folder option, it can be very 
easy to tell when you have new mail at login. Another option at an 
X-windows terminal is to use some program like mailbox, which has a 
little flag which goes up when you have new mail. Some such programs will 
even start pine for you when you click on the mailbox icon.

Hi folks!

I am using Pine 3.91 for Windows with IMAP (all folders are on server). 
What I have noted, is very slow sorting of folders. For example, folder 
with 60 messages gets sorted by Date: substantially more then one minute.

It could be _very_ annoying, if you were a couple of day off and are on 
some popular mailing list.

Is it general problem, or just my local configuration? Is it slated to 
change in 3.92?

Thanks for info

Greetings all!

I was wondering if there exists some software that would allow me to read
a downloaded Pine mail folder locally on my pc.  I have a large folder of
technical e-mails, and would love to be able to read them one by one,
rather than scrolling through a long ascii file.  Does such a thing exist? 
Feel free to respond directly - thank you! 

I'm running OS/2, so any OS/2, DOS or Windows-based reader would fit the
bill.

Hello imap folks.

Now, we intend to install imap mail system as main mail 
system.
I am wondering how many users can access single imap server 
at same time. We plan to use SS20 or PowerPC AIX machine
with bunch of memory ?

Do these machine allows simaltaneous  200 clients access  
with resonable speed ?

Our expreience shows pop provide over 200 clients access
at same time.

I am looking forward to your reply.

Thank you.

Hi!

I have a question--I'm working with pine 3.91 on a unix system v system
and have a problem: The greatest Love of my live *smile* wants to send a
few mails, but she wants not to have an own account.
                         ^^^
Now i thought that it would be possible to define two incoming folders
(that's not really the problem, of course) and install a program that can
direkt HER mails to HER incoming folder and MY mails to MY incoming folder.

That program should be able to direct the mail in depedence on i.e. the 
subject or the address (To- or From-Field) or perhaps the content of the 
body.

I need the name of some of such programs (and the location of such 
programs (i.e. ftp-server)) and a "how-to-install-manual" for that.

Please send a Cc of your answer to ma (PM). Thank you very much for 
helping me!

Bye.

	Ralf

How could you use _two_ signatures in Pine? One for public , one for

It does use the quick sort algorithm.

My Pine on freenet.scri.fsu became overloaded with incoming mail. I 
unsubscribed and cleaned it back to 1 Mb with 1 Mb free.  I am still 
getting abnormal aborts with folder locks when moving between folders; 
leaving debugs in my home files. I also think that incoming is bouncing.
Help!  Also, I need a manual on how to manage mail and how to manage home 
files.  Freenet help has not responded adequately.

Hello everyone!

Today we were "fortunate" enough to receive a piece of E-Mail containing 
a file that was sent using the MIME content type "application/mac-binhex40".

I do not know what the advantages of this content type are compared to 
the normal BASE64 encoding (definitely not convenience ;-), but naturally we
don't want to inform the sender that our trusted Pine cannot handle this format.

So, can anyone come to our rescue?  Is there a MAC-BINHEX 4.0 Viewer/Converter
available that can be used with our UNIX Pine?

I'd welcome any pointer on BINHEX for UNIX, including why anyone would want
to use it.

Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,

- Richard Gering.

I have pine3.91 installed in my linux box.

It works as a news reader well. But I couln't get it
to work as a mail reader.

My mail reader settings are

Pine reports the following message while trying to read INBOX

Short answer: Yes, provided you use reasonably fast disks, and moderately
small ones (e.g. 1GB).  That is, you will be limited by seek bandwidth.
Also, if you are using the UW IMAP server, we suggest using Tenex format
mail files, as they are more memory-efficient than mbox format files.

I would like the smartest person to read this and tell me why I can't 
connect to our unix pine server (on an DG/Aviion) using pc-pine through 
Netcom's Netcruiser winsock.  While connecting, the program just hangs 
until it times out.  I followed the instructions on setup (to the best of 
my ability).  Is there some trick in the configuration that I need to do?

Please reply, and I will be forever in your debt.
Thanks

    It appears to be a philosophy of no local buffering of the index list. 
When I sort a list I notice that the items are reread from my ISP's news
server.  This happens over a 28.8KB line and slows down the sort.  I 
imagine an option to buffer the index locally would solve the problem.

    I have noticed that sending a message 'To:' someone and posting  
it to a newsgroup at the same time cause the newsgroup item to show the 
'To:' address rather than the 'From:' address?  This looks funny.  Is 
this a feature or a fluke?

Get the original post number (the "references") and be sure to have a
"Control:" header in the list of optional headers, or use the command
in pine to allow you to add it.

Use the following headers:

Control: cancel <D6J5Jz.72A@indirect.com> 
Subject: cmsg cancel <D6J5Jz.72A@indirect.com> 

And have a non-empty text; the signature should be sufficient

    I don't know that there is a version of Pine as such that supports 
PGP, but there is something called mkpgp under Unix to provide an 
interface.  I have never used it, so I cannot vouch for it.  Also, the 
following was posted on this newsgroup last spring.  Again, I can't 
vouch for it, and it applies only to Pine/Unix.

I've started using pine, and I've found it to be much more powerful than 
mh, but I'm a little frustrated with some of the petty problems that I 
face. Right now I'm trying to work a header for the quotes, for instance, 
with mh I used to have:

On {date}, it was a dark and stormy night, when you wrote:

And the quote began. Now I just have the quote. I've looked in the setup 
for such a switch, or whatever but I've found nothing. I've also looked 
in .pinerc, but the same problem. Now what?

Absolutely none.

Speaking as a long time and current Mac owner, I would *definitely*
tell them that Pine can't handle this format, and *definitely* ask
that it be resent.  If they're using Mac Eudora (very likely), tell
them to send it properly this time by using AppleDouble.  Don't take
no for an answer, and don't let them ever send you Binhex again.  If
anyone ever sent me a Binhex attachement to my Unix workstations,
that's what I'd do (after deleting the thing), and I'm fully equipped
to deal with Binhex on Unix because I own a Mac.  It's trivial for Mac
users to get this right, and if they'd bother to turn on Balloon Help,
Eudora itself would tell them what to use.

>So, can anyone come to our rescue?  Is there a MAC-BINHEX 4.0 Viewer/Converter

You can find one in the Info-Mac archives by searching for mcvert:

<http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive.html>

I use mcvert on my Suns and it does the job.  You'll need to use the flag
telling mcvert to separate the resource and data forks.

>I'd welcome any pointer on BINHEX for UNIX, including why anyone would want
>to use it.

The reason that Binhex is used is that Mac files contain two forks,
the data fork and the resouce fork.  The data fork usually contains
the working part of a file (the text of a text document, the gif of a
gif, etc.) and is almost always the only part of the file that would
be of any use on a non-Mac.  The resource fork usually contains very
Mac specific stuff (fonts, icons, etc.).  Binhex is a way of combining
the two forks of a Mac file into a single text file so that it can be
transported through e-mail.  AppleDouble is another, superior way.
AppleDouble separates the data and resource forks into two separate
Base64 encoded attachments.  Anyone on a non-Mac can discard the
resource fork and decode the data fork trivially (it works well in
Pine).  Binhex is ubiquitous in the Mac world, and, unfortunately,
Eudora permits it as one of its encoding choices without putting up a
fuss.  (It should at least notify Mac users with a dialog box that it
shouldn't be used to send mail to people not using Macs.)

What kind of memory does IMAPd take up? 

If a user has a 5Mb mailbox consisting of 300 messages, how much memory
will their IMAPd process occupy?

5Mb?
300 x (size of the header lines) ?
more? less?

Hello,

I'm not a regular on this mailing list, but follow the discussions on 
comp.mail.pine. Back on 30 October I posted the following problem to the 
newsgroup - but our news host has been off the air for most of the past 
couple of weeks, so I have been unable to receive any replies. I've checked 
the list archives and found the original message on 31 October, but that 
would put replies in the November archive which is not yet on-line. 

If anyone has been able to shed any light on this problem, could I please 
ask if you would be so kind as to re-post by email.

Many thanks,

John Wolff

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have an IMAP user who has been banished to field work with a DOS-based 286 
laptop. I have been trying to get the packet version of pcpine 3.91 to 
work with the U of Minnesota "umslip" serial line packet driver to allow him 
to access his existing mail store, but am not having much success. 

umslip loads ok and connects to my dialup router (a Netblazer), pktstats 
shows a packet driver on 0x60, the ping  program ex CUTCP works ok, and 
minuet work OK, so I figure this end of it is working.

But pcpine doesn't like it, and is unable even to resolve the mailhost name 
over umslip. Modem lights and a trace on the dialup router show DNS packets 
being sent and received, but no action results. (I haven't tackled the 
protocol analyser yet to check the content of the packets).

Using the IP address instead of server name in the inbox definition 
produces an IMAP protocol exchange with the mailhost, but pine quits 
with "connection broken by server" (or words to that effect). Syslog on the 
imap server does not show a connection ever having been established.

However, exactly the same pcpine configuration works fine over an ethernet 
packet driver on a desktop machine (lsl/smc8000/odipkt24). 

So both halves of the setup work independently, but they just don't seem to 
communicate at the packet layer. Any light on this problem would be much 
appreciated, or any suggestions for an alternative dial-up system that will 
work with Pine on a DOS-based 286.

Also: I can not get pcpine to produce a debug file as described in the tech 
notes, even if started with -d9. Is this supposed to work, or is there a 
trick 
to this too?

Many thanks,

Thanks. After some experimenting I discovered that this also works
in IMAP2:

	*{imapserver/imap}newsgroup

I like this better because it reminds me that it's using imap
instead of nntp to access the news group.  Where in the pinerc
does it make sense to put this?  It worked in incoming-folders
but I'm wondering where else it makes sense.

Also, the following works in news-collections:

	*{imapserver/imap}[]

I'm wondering if there's a way to specify a news hierarchy with
something like this:
 
	*{imapserver/imap}#mh/usr/spool/news/hierarchy[]

This didn't work but it seems like something like it should work...

IMAP is the greatest Internet protocol in the universe!
It is the future!
It will be the downfall of the PC and Microsoft!

Does anybody know where I can get an IMAP BASED query program that would 
check whether or not I have new mail waiting.  On the system that I use, 
the inboxes are stored on a remote server that is accessed using the IMAP 
protocol.  Thanks for your help.

  Is there any way to select the messages thus marked? There does not

Use a filter!

Problem:
The filter cannot tell you two apart as you're using the same address.
So the filter can only sort mails depending on the subject.
This can only be done iff the sender knows which subject to chose to send to
either you or your girlie.  If the sender fails to send the correct subject
then the filter won't know.

It's a lot easier to get an account be done with.
Anyway, allowing others on your account is "verboten"!

And another one to explain it to you.

Yes, reading in a signature with your editor's "read file" command is the way
it always works.  But I believe that Karoly wants to know whether PINE can
have a "list of signatures".

It sure would be nice if you could define a context for signatures, eg via some
kind of "rule file".  Scenario:
	if (to == address1)		then appendsig file1
	if (to =  group1)		then appendsig group1sig
	if (to =  localhostname)	then appendsig companysig
	if (to =  adressoffriend)	then appendsig funsig
	if (true)			then appendsig personalsig

It would be even nicer if the signatures get stripped to 4 lines and 80
columns.  :-)

ELM distinguishes a "localsignature" and "remotesignature".
Does PINE have such a feature?

Subject: Reading news with multiple .newsrcs?
Message-Id: <vjlDI2oo3.6FH@netcom.com>
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:57:38 GMT

     I'm currently using Pine3.91 to read netnews (NETCOM doesn't yet
     allow us access to their NNTP server, so I can't post using Pine). I
     have recently decided to split my .newsrc file up into several files
     and alias tin to start up netnews reading with a file I choose (I
     used the -f arg). That way I have netnews sorted to my needs (ie: if
     I want to view only clari news, I have a .clarinews file which
     includes the clari.* heirarchy). Is there some way for Pine to read
     more than one .newsrc file so I can read all newsgroups with the
     above setup?  

     Thanks in advance for any info y'all can provide.

Someone should put together a FAQ about this.  (Ok, maybe I'll do it).

There are a variety of tools.  All of them involve invoking some script
as your alternative editor.  In order to work with incoming mail you
have to "reply" to it (you don't need to send the reply) to get into
the alternate editor.

I am aware of the existence of at least four programs such systems
that work with pine (and presumably any other Unix mailer which can
use an "alternate editor").

The one that I use (but that doesn't mean that it is the best, only that
it is the first one I came across which does what I need) is mkpgp
which is a csh script that will not only call pgp as appropriate but,
ispell, encryption for attachments, will try to fetch keys from keyservers,
etc.

You can get it by sending mail to
  deviate@lipschitz.sfasu.edu
with Subject "mkpgp" (without the quotes)

A list of some tools is available at
 http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/utils.shtml
which can be reached from the International PGP home page
 http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/

One is "Bryce's AutoPGP" which is a fairly recent development, but
I haven't tried it.  Putatively there is something called
AutoPGP (distinct from Bryce's), but I don't know where that can
be found.

There is also something known as editpgp (but I don't know where
it's home is either).

Additionally, many of these tools are available from any good pgp
ftp site, such as ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/pgp .

If anyone has additions, amplifications or corrections please send me
mail, and I will compile a list if Pine and Unix PGP tools (does
PC-Pine work with an alternative editor?) and will forward the list
to the maintainers of various archives and websites.

It is NOT the responsibility of a newsreader to ofrm and format the
"From: " line of an article's header.

That IS the responsibility of the news transport s/w, such as inews, etc.

Now why don't *you* RTFRFC!

Sheesh ...


To answer Manzoor's original question ... on most UNIX systems, you only
need to set the NAME env var to whatever you want, and the transport s/w
should pick it up.  Ie:  setenv NAME "Your Name"  in your .cshrc file for
csh/tcsh users, or  NAME="Your Name"
                    export NAME     in your .profile for sh/ksh users.


If that doesn't do the trick, here's a workaround ... you MAY be able to
add your own properly formatted "From: " line to the article header, and
have it pass thru the news transport s/w unaltered.  This does work with
"inews" ... I dunno about other transport pgms.

For example, put the following line in a file:

	From: hassan@austin.asc.slb.com (Manzoor ul Hassan)

and suck it into your article as the 1st line of the header.  If that works,
and you want to automate the process, you'll need to make a copy of the
"Pnews" shell-script that trn uses to build headers, startup your editor,
etc, and modify it to add in your "From: " line.  Then you tell trn to use
your version of Pnews by setting the NEWSPOSTER env var appropriately.  See
trn's man page for further info on this env var.

Subject: Suppressing "@userdomain" in @-less To

One solution to a problem I have (described below, but not really needed
to understand the question) would be to suppress Pine's insistance
on rewriting (in a to or cc field) "foo" as "foo@userdomain".

Alternatively, is there a way to get pine to use an different "userdomain"
for the To and Cc (and Bcc) fields then for the From field.

I would like a solution that can be done in pine.conf.  That is,
a solution that has each user modifying their own .pinerc is not
satisfactory.

Because we run on a variety of different platforms (many sharing the
same pine.conf) I would really not like to have to modify the pine
source and recompile (in particular, I don't want to recompile
either PC-Pine or VMS-Pine).  I am willing to entertain such a solution
if I can expect I will not have to do the same for future releases.

The Problem:

As I mentioned above, it is not really essential that you understand
the problem that I am trying to solve to help answer the question,
but maybe you see alternative solutions (there are alternative solutions
which I am also exploring)

For the examples, I will use my username (cc047) and nickname "J.Goldberg"
and my (usual) local host (xdm011.pegasus.cranfield.ac.uk), and our
smtp server (calisto.ccc.cranfield.ac.uk).

Our smtp server (running pp, not sendmail) will do a number of things
When it receives and smtp connection sending mail with a from line
like (userid@subdomain.cranfield.ac.uk) it will rewrite it as
Nickname@cranfield.ac.uk.  So in my case, if it is handed
  From: cc047@xdm011.pegasus.cranfield.ac.uk
it will rewrite that as 
  From: J.Goldberg@Cranfield.ac.uk

However, if it receives something like
  From: cc047@Cranfield.ac.uk

it will not attempt to rewrite it.

On the otherhand if it gets something to

  RCPT To: G.Goldberg@Cranfield.ac.uk

(A non-existent user)

It will provide immediate feedback that the user is unknown.  It will
also do the same with

  RCPT To: G.Goldberg

This means that Pine can refuse to send the message.  However, if the smpt
server is handed

  RCPT To: G.Goldberg@xdm011.pegasus.cranfield.ac.uk

It will accept the message, and the error will only be reported as a bounce
later on.

Obviously the correct solution is to modify all of our pp tables
to somehow get the rewriting we need, but that requires understanding pp
which is somehow not as easy as understanding pine.

I strongly support this and would like to put it on the wish list.

  It should be possible to suppress adding the local domain to every
  unqualified address (also in From: header).

  It should be run-time
  configurable (how am I supposed to recompile LWP Pine?)

It not only the problem mentioned in original message. We have internal 
mail system which doesn't use domains at all (in Internet sense). Every 
message gets my local host name tacked on. It is possible to modify 
sendmail to get around, but it requires additional lookups which slow 
down sendmail (as name space is somewhat large).

Is it really neccessary? Either user is local and don't need domain at
all, or user is remote and already have domain in any case.

I would like to thank everyone who helped us to solve the MAC-BINHEX problem.

It turned out that the person sending us the message didn't even have a Mac.
Instead, he used an old version of PC Eudora that apparently automatically
uses BINHEX for file attachments. It seems that he should upgrade FAST!

Anyway, I've learned to politely ask all people who send BINHEX files to our
Unix system to resend them using BASE64 encoding. You'll learn something new
every day ;-)

Thanks again for all your help!

Best regards,

- Richard Gering.

Friend, 
 
 
On 11 14 95 Loureiro asked how to read news with pine. 
 
On 11 15 95 jyetse answered 
 
  At the Pine main menu, press S for Setup, C for Config. 
  Then enter the address of your NNTP server into the field 
  "nntp-server". 
 
To read news with pine on ovnet.com, these are the specific 
entries I've had to make: 
 
personal-name          = James M. Cobb
user-domain            = ahcbsd1.ovnet.com
 
... 
 
nntp-server            = 198.77.1.4
 
  Note that an IP address is used. 
 
... 
 
news-collections       = *{198.77.1.4/nntp}[]
 
  Note the * right before the brace.  Note that an IP address 
  is used.  Note there are no spaces inside the braces.  Note 
  that right after the end-brace, there's a pair of brackets 
  (which may look like a tiny rectangle on your screen).  Note 
  there is no space inside the brackets.  Note braces are nei- 
  ther parentheses nor brackets. 
 
 
If only an IP address will work on your system, then you may 
have to ask your system operator to provide you such an address. 
  
Good luck! 
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim

Pico compiled just fine, and I can run it, but Pine did not compile. 

Any help on what to do would be much appreciated.

I had this problem in a similar context. It seems the mail program ELM
generates "From" lines without colons (ie, in the format "From person
date"). It's possible (probable?) that ELM predates RFC-822. My boss
solved the problem by telling ELM users who sent him email (ie, me
<G>) to stop using ELM and start using PINE. You might try this and/or
switching to ELM (ELM has no problem with colon-less From lines; my
boss was less than enthusiastic about my suggestion he switch to ELM).

in 3.91 you can use the "PIPE" command:

when reading your mail...and run into uuencoded mail...type

|uudecode<CR>

this will result in the uudecoded file being dropped in your current

I am postmaster at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. We have approx
12000 students on campus and of course some of those have disablities.  We
have one student who is blind.  She has an electronic reader that reads
everything on the screen.  This allows her to use computers.  When using
Pine, the reader reads every character on the screen before she can type
anything.  

To start, I would like a way to remove the "menu" from the bottom of the
compose window. Does anybody know of a way to do this?

Our users have occasionally received e-mail via pine with the first line 
of the body text missing. If you then view it via the Header mode, then 
you can see the missing first line. 

I have trid open the mail folder using the 'vi' editor, and found that 
the first line of the body text was somehow being placed  as part of the 
header right before the 'Status: R0' line.

Does anyone know why and how to correct the problem ? Thanks !!

I have been sending messages to get help but nobody will help me.  When I 
get into my e-mail account I get the message on the bottom saying "Trying 
mailbox lock from process 19443" and then I also get "mailbox is open by 
another process".  I can't delete anything and I don't understand why.  I 
never locked my keyboard and nobody seems to know why it is doing this.  
Please help me.  I already have over 100 messages in a few short hours.

I'm not sure which unix you use, but try from a unix shell
ps -ef|grep 19443

if you get an error message try

ps aux|grep 19443

you should get two lines, look at the end, one is your command (grep), the other one is the command
which locks your mail folder. If you get only one line with your command, than there is an old
lock from (perhaps) a crashed PINE.

If you haven't done already quit PINE.

You should remove the process 19443 an restart PINE. Now all should be OK.

If you only got one line with your grep command, then there is an old lockfile, perhaps from a
crashed PINE. You must find out where the lockfile is and delete it (Mine is usually /tmp/.18.xxx)

But my guess is that you once suspended PINE and instead of coming back started a new PINE. Then you
should quit your PINE and come back to the old one.

Perhaps this solves your problem.

Ciao fro cold Hamburg,
 Michael

see if you have any other PINE processes running - 

i.e. try: ps -ef | grep pine

This should show you any other terminals at which you have sessions 
running or runaway pines.

you might alsow try:

ps -fu akimmel 

to see what you have running on the system.

First item -  Downloading in Pine discussion:

I notice that it is possible in pipe to Unix commands while in Pine 3.91
on a Digital Unix box by setting up this option in the SETUP/CONFIG file. 
Once I noticed this feature, I thought it would be neat to see if I could
pipe to SZ while viewing a message so that I could have Pine send my
message via ZModem to my home machine.  However, when I did |sz while
viewing the message I wanted to send, I only got as far as the ZModem
options menu.  Doing |sz -b produced the same result.  I need to somehow
tell SZ what filename to send but there appears no way to do this.  Any
ideas of where I could go from there?  Should this maybe be added as a
feature for the next release of Pine?  What I mean is, could Pine be
developed in such a way so that the user is given an option of sending the
message they are viewing via a transfer protocol like Kermit or ZModem
instead of having to export the message to their main directory and stuff? 
Yes, I know that one can SZ files in one's mail directories from one's
shell but the disadvantage of doing this is that all the single mail
messages in a Pine mail folder are combined in a single file.  Enabling
this "proposed" feature would get around this.  What I am talking about is
setting up Pine to do what lynx does when one chooses the download option.

Second Item - Sending Binary files through mail: Mime vs. Uuencode

I notice that it is possible to send binary files through e-mail (like 
GIF picture files, spreadsheets, programs, MS Word files, etc) by either
first uuencoding the file and sending it through Pine or by using Pine's 
built in MIME encooder.  My query is this.  I often have students send
files to me and they often have problems grasping computer concepts.  Is 
it better for the file [and the mail system as a whole] to send binaries 
as uuencoded or MIME files?  Please advise.  Thanks! :)

Brian,
For version 3.92 (still no date, but getting ever closer!) several
features have been added to assist the visually impaired, including the
ability to turn off the key menu.

If you do not use a printer, you can set your `printer' as `sz %s'
(without quotes), so when you press `Y' and then Yes (or enter), your
message will be sent to you via ZMODEM protocol. But it works only if you
do not need to print. Or you can try to pipe to something like `cat >
/tmp/pine.$$; sz /tmp/pine.$$; rm /tmp/pine.$$', but I didn't try it.=20

Hope it helps, V. S.

Here is a problem that rears its ugly head from time to time:

We are using Pine 3.91 on a Sun with Solaris 2.4.  We also have a Usenet 
news server running on Linux.

Whenever our Usenet News host goes down, Pine users get hung up at the 
main menu as Pine is "building folder list".  We know that this is 
because when a user sets up his/her folders to read Usenet articles, and 
the News server is down, Pine looks indefinitely for the news host and 
just hangs.

Is there an option in pine.conf that will get around this?  I usually end 
up swapping versions of Pine from 3.91 to 3.89 until the News host is 
back up again, but I'd rather have the problem fixed.

Thanks
Keith Reel

Is there a way for me to system wide (Unix server) disable the email
that gets sent to users the first time that they startup pine.
It seems to me that most people say yes, then have this big message
hanging around forever. Which of course never gets looked at again but
just takes up disk space (when multiplied over 5000 users)

Wherever you like.

Yes, this is the normal way

No, it won't work.  #mh require a mh profile file with the definition of
the mh path.  And since the mh driver is read/write, you probably wouldn't
want it to work... ;-)

Thanks.

Actually, there's some hope of Microsoft adopting IMAP and supporting it
as part of their bundled TCP/IP applications.  Let's cross fingers...

It depends upon the mailbox format in use.  If you use the default Unix
mailbox format, imapd keeps a snapshot of the mailbox in memory.  If you
use certain other formats, such as tenex, only the currently-read message
is in memory.  Read the Pine Technical Notes for more information.

imapd also keeps the results of any prior RFC-822/MIME parses of the
message in memory.  How much that is depends upon the complexity of the
RFC-822 and MIME headers.  It only does a parse on demand though, so it
isn't likely that all 300 messages will have cached parses.

It's not just for news that it does that.  Whenever you are reading a
message that you sent it will show the recipient (To) instead of showing
that you sent it.  This was thought to be more useful.  In 3.92 you'll be
able to make it always show From if you prefer that.

The brief answer is:

	An email address without an "@domain" is in violation of
	RFC-821, RFC-822, and other email specifications.  Pine
	complies with these specifications.

Specifically, if you use a standard (^A^A^A^A or From separated) Unix
mailbox format then IMAP will keep a copy of the entire mailbox in memory
for as long as the client is connected to the server.

This kills my hopes for using IMAP on a large scale, since RAM is still
expensive and swapping kills system performance. Plus of course my
MDA doesn't support Tenex format.

Hello!

Well I did set up sendmail 8.7.1 and it works fine with elm, but Pine
introduces its own From: line to sendmail and sendmail respects that.

How would one stop pine to introduce that line?

Because of that I can't get First.Last@host working with pine.

rfc821 per definition specifies ONLY interaction BETWEEN hosts.

How mail is presented to local MTA is LOCAL matter, so far as message

I think that these statements are overblown.

RAM costs about $35/MB.

Most modern UNIX systems page instead of swap.  The result is that the
actual memory consumed is much smaller than the virtual memory.

"Swapping kills system performance" is one of these great truisms that get
passed around without full understanding.  A great deal depends upon the
nature of the swapping and of the system configuration.  If you swap onto
a slow disk that also is busy going filesystem activity, you probably will
have a problem.  If you configure your system properly, preferably keeping
swapping on its own spindle, you will have much less of a problem.

The alternative to keeping a snapshot of the mailbox in memory is to use a
temporary file when rewriting mbox or MMDF (what you call "standard UNIX
mailbox format") file.  The reason why another copy is needed is that the
Status: and X-Status: lines make it possible for a message to grow into
the space consumed by subsequent messages.  That's why most other mail
programs use the scratch file.

The problem is that this requires disk space.  Many academic sites have
rather tight disk quotas.  Put another way, it's easier for a student to
get 5MB of RAM than it is for her to get 5MB of free disk space.

To make matters worse, on many UNIX systems it is necessary to make sure
that the inode doesn't change.  This means that the rewrite of the file
has to happen on top of the old data.  So this means *two* copies of the
data, first to the temp file and then back.  On most virtual memory UNIX
systems, having an in-memory snapshot results in about half the disk
traffic than the temp file method.

Tenex, mtx, mbx (new in imap-4), and mh formats don't have this problem.
This is because it is possible to make updates to mailboxes in these
formats without having to worry about overwriting data in subsequent
messages.  In tenex, mtx, and mbx, it does random-access updates in place
on pre-allocated status fields, and expunge is implemented by moving
messages down on top of deleted messages.  In mh, each message is a
separate file.

Sorry if I am repeating someone else's point: I missed the beginning 
of this thread. Sorry also if I have merely failed to RTFM or UTFM, 
where U=understand. Anyway:

23 ) when one says q to pine one is immediately asked 
Really quit pine? 
     and only after answering that question is one asked things like
Save the 1 read message in "received"? 
     and
Expunge the 1 deleted message from "INBOX"? 

I would rather be asked the latter kind of question _before_ having 
to answer the former one because I might not quit if reminded there
were still some messages lying around.

  In pine 3.91... 
  select (;), then T(ext), T(o), and then enter your email address
  and return.
  It will select all mail sent directely to you.

  For mail sent to you as a carbon copy (very diferent than from a
  mailing list), use the same, but instead of T(o), use C(arbon

Message-Id: <48fg0l$o2r@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

When using the Select Number (; N) command, you aren't currently allowed
to specify number ranges such as -50 or 50-.  Pine interprets the missing
number as a zero and responds with an out of range error.

Since selecting to either the beginning or end of my current index is
something I often do and suspect others do as well, I request that this
behavior be modified such that a missing number be interpolated as either
the beginning or end of the allowable range.

Message-Id: <48fjgi$4gb@azure.acsu.buffalo.edu>


Hello-

I've made the following change to my .pinerc:

global-address-book=.addressbook .add2

and inside pine I can go to my address book and I see:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal AddressBook <.addressbook>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Global AddressBook <.addressbook>
(ReadOnly)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]


the first one(personal) is the .addressbook file
and the second one(global) is the .add2 file even though it shows it wrong.
I can expand both lists to see them correctly.

However why is the second one ReadOnly when the protections on the file
are ok?

thanks in advance

joel

David,
You can get an mail delivery agent that understands Tenex format from our
ftp server.  It's called "tmail".  I think it's in
  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

Joel,

1. pinerc entries need to be separated by commas.
2. The personal addressbook entry is being picked up by default, not
   because of the value in the *global* variable
3. Global addressbooks are intentionally read-only because they are
   intended to be shared by multiple users and updated by a cron job.
   To make them read/write introduces the requirement for record
   locking, with its associated complexity and performance implications.

I have a very specific question for anyone out there who knows something 
about Pine addressbooks, externally created distribution lists, and VMS 
(like I said, it was fairly specific).

We currently have a program that creates mail distribution lists for a 
rudimentary VMS mailing program.  This program creates simple text files 
for distribution lists.

I recently modified this program to make PINE distribution lists.  The 
form is the same as that required for a PINE addressbook distribution 
list as outlined in the Pine Web page.  When PINE reads the file, it sees 
that it has been modified by an external process (not modified, it's a 
new file), and it "fixes" it.  Unfortunately, PINE destroys it.

Has anyone out there had similar problems?  I've made sure that the new 
file is the only addressbook file, I've tried it with the addressbook-lu 
file there, I've tried it with it absent, you name it.  So if anyone has 
any ideas, please let me know.  I've had another person verify the format 
of the addressbook, so if any of you know of any little "quirks" in the 
VMS version, please let me know.  Thanks!

If PINE is open while the global addressbook is updated (and auxiliarly index
updated with dont-sort option), I must close and re-open PINE, in order to use the Global Addressbook.
  
  Is this problem familiar to anyone ? 
Does anyone has any advice how to solve this problem ?
 
Thanks you for cooperation.

No you can't.

You now have two options:

1) use Reply-To:
   From the (S)etup/(C)onfig screen add "Reply-To: <your email>" to the customized-hdrs list

2) recompile with allowance to override the From: field. This is somewhere in the os-dependent files
   I don't recall the exact name, but grep for FROM and you should find it.

I just tried it in folder-collections and news-collections and it didn't 
work.  It said something about bad context and no '[' in context.  What I'm
trying to do is specify a list of about 10 newsgroups in the pinerc
rather than in newsrc and I'm wondering where, other than incoming-folders,
I could do that.

I'm curious what other ways work.  I know about:

  *{imapserver}[]
  *{imapserver/nntp}[]

But I'm curious what else.

Well, it would be nice to be able to specify news hierarchies, e.g.,
comp.mail.* in the pinerc.  Any plans for that capability?

Even if Microsoft adopts IMAP (which I definitely hope they do), IMAP
will help make it easy for little inexpensive "dumb terminals" to access the
Net and thus vastly shrink the market for PCs and Windows.  These dumb
terminals (along with the fact that MS really screwed up about the Internet)
is why Bill Gates sounded so scared and defensive in the brief Comdex 
interview with him I heard on the radio a couple days ago.

But it is the responsibility of the MTA (sendmail or the like) to
enforce this, not the MUA.

At the very least you should include the option of leaving this up to
the MTA.

There's a Unix program called xbin which decodes BinHex 4.0 attachments;
archie returns plenty of ftp sites.  There may or may not be a way of
invoking it automatically from Pine but at any rate one can always save
the attachment to a file and then decode it.

One hopes that BinHex and uuencode will gradually die out in favour of
base64 or 8-bit binary.

Subject: Q: pine & ansi

I've been experimenting with pine lately, looking for a replacement
to SUN's Xwindows based mail tool. A problem I have is that pine
works good within a SUN shell window, but when I execute it within
telnet login window (over PPP), I get the following termination
error message:

"Your terminal, of type "ansi", is lacking functions needed to run
pine."

Is ANSI truly inadequate for pine?

BTW, my termcap and terminfo setting for ANSI are virtually the same
as they are for VT100.

Message-Id: <DI56t4.5JI@baan.nl>

Hello world,

Is the following possible in pine:

Specify multiple imap in-boxes with different user-id's. 

I couldn't find something like that in either documentation or source code. 
The feature would be welcome to me since I would like to check mail from 
different users (admin stuff etc.) but log-on from one pine.

How about specifying POP and IMAP folders like below:

incoming-folders=INCOMING inbox,
        INCOMING some_user {some_user@some.host.domain}inbox,
        INCOMING other_user {other_user@some.host.domain}inbox

Greetings,

Yes, on the computer you want incoming mail redirected to another just 
create a .forward file which contents your login name and the redirection 
address:

#.forward
\userid, "another-id@another.machine"

Hello,

Recently someone posted a statement mentioning a patch for pine to allow
sending 8-bit Mails to 8-bit capable Mailers without converting everything
to Quoted-Printable. 
Somewhere in it was an taiwanese e-mail address where to get this patch.
Actually I mailed this person but all I got back was an empty mail.

So I'm asking : Is there anybody out there who can send me the needed
patch ???


Thanx in advance

some character based mail reader that works in Wyse60 emulation.   It need

Not much of a thought, since we _are_ an ISP.  Amy would have gotten more
useful advice a lot closer to home had she contacted our Help Desk before
asking for help here.  We would have killed the offending Pine process, or
would have explained how she could do it her self.  We would _not_ have
told her to use the reboot command like someone on this list did.  I 
finally had to lock her account to stop her from trying.

Why not set your Wyse 60 to VT100 emulation mode.  You could do this 
under software control.  Write a script to set your term to vt100, then 
execute pine, then reset your term on exiting pine.  At least I think you 
can do this.    <shrug>

Message-Id: <48gjg6$2bf@hobbes.NebrWesleyan.edu>

Quick Question:  Anybody have a problem with pine dumping core on a
Solaris 2.3 machine?  Can you provide pointers as to where one should
look to figure out why?  I was hoping not to have to go through a core file.

Everyday I delete about 20-30MB of core files; 95% of them are the result
of pine dumping core.  I'm using version 3.91 of pine.

Thanks for any info anyone can provide.

Later,

Hi folks!

Sorry for (may be) simple question, but I couldn't find how to do it.

How can I force new folder to be in Tenex format? I would like to save 
the message, folder doesn't yet exist - how do I tell Pine, that it is 
Tenex and not standard Unix? So far, all folders were cerated as 
standard Unix.

I am using PC Pine 3.91 (Winsock) over IMAP (all folders remote)

Thanks for any idea

    Again, Pine as such will not do it.  You have to preprocess the mail 
before Pine gets it.  On Unix and its derivatives, Procmail and Filter 
are two widely used programs for preprocessing mail this way.

> Is there a way to uuencode stuff and uudecode stuff with pine?

    Uuencode?  No, unless you uuencode it first out of Pine and then read 
it into a message with Ctrl-R.  Uudecode?  Yes, under Unix, if you enable 
Unix piping and pipe a message through uudecode to a separate file in the 
current directory (and provided your uudecoder can handle extraneous 
lines at the top).

> If these features are not in pine will they be added?

    That is up to the Pine Development Team.  I don't know, but a lot of 
people are waiting to find out.

    Please be aware that this technique applies only to UNIX and its

Pine is also an SMTP client, and as such is an MTA.

It has been shown, many times over the years, that this does not work.
This idea is not new.  It was popular about 15 years ago.  It created many
ongoing problems.

Unqualified addresses that are generated by other mailers cause more bug
reports due to these problems -- which are out of our control -- that we
get about the generation of fully qualifed addresses.

An MTA which is smart enough to rewrite addresses to suit local site
policy can also be made smart enough to accept fully-qualified addresses
as input.

Ask yourself if you would rather fix your smart MTA to be a little bit
smarter so it can rewrite fully-qualified addresses, or if you would
prefer to get more messages from outside with unqualified addresses that
your smart MTA rewrites with its best (but often wrong) guess of the right
thing.

An interesting dichotomy, as presented above.

I am intrigued by the idea that making one's local MTA smarter
suddenly causes everybody else to stop generating bad addresses.

The syntax for specifying an addressbook is

    optional_nickname  filename

so this line is giving the file .add2 the nickname of .addressbook.
That's why it looks funny in the display.  If you want an address book to
be read-write instead of read-only, just make it a personal address book
instead.  So you probably want

address-book=.addressbook, .add2

Yes.  Next!  ;-)

I wonder what kind of removal is asked here.
Of course you can edit your mailbox with an editor.
And you can edit the mail when you send it along by editing it.
You can also use a filter like procmail to change parts of the header and body.
There are lots of thing you can do.
But - what do you want?

I think that the global addressbook MUST be ReadOnly, 
because it"s a system side addressbook.

Subject: saving to folders in folder collections
Date: Thu, 16 Nov 1995 16:11:47 +0100 (MET)
Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9511161507.A11222-0100000@poseidon.ifctr.mi.cnr.it>

Please respond also by e-mail, I cannot read the newsgroup quite regularly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After being fed-up of scrolling thru several pages of folders (I have the 
habit to sort mail by project or subject, and I have some 180 different 
folders), I decided to re-arrange my folders in collections.

Thus I put in my .pinerc something like :

folder-collections=MAIL mail/[],
        SAX  /mail/.Sax/[],
        etc.etc.

In my ~/mail directory I created a number of "hidden" subdirectories like 
.Sax, .Xmm etc. (named by project), moved there all subproject folders 
related to the given project, and associated to that a folder collection 
as indicated above.

(I'd like to keep such directories as subdirectories of my main mail 
directory for obvious reasons. I used "hidden" dot-names for the 
subdirectories so that Pine does not show them when listing the folders 
in the default MAIL collection.)

I found navigation thru folders reasonable (with ^N ^P), although I won't 
mind if folder list (L command, with feature-list including 
"no-expanded-view-of-folders") would be more compact (list only 
collection names, not several lines, and expand-unexpand toggle key).

What I am puzzled with is SAVING outgoing mail to folders.
I like to save both incoming and outgoing mail by project/subproject.

Thus I go to Fcc and I'd like to type the collection and folder name, but 
this is not possible (there is no syntax for it).
Apparently it is also not possible to type the folder name, and assume it 
goes in the "current" collection.

The only way is from Fcc to type ^T, select a collection, and then select 
a folder. But even then ...

 ... pine will present the folder name as e.g. mail/.Sax/subproject

and when sending the mail will ask permission to create non existing 
folder with such name in the MAIL collection (although such folder as a 
file exists in ~/mail/.Sax/subproject  !!!)

So far the only way out I've found is to edit .pinerc and type there the 
fully qualified path 

folder-collections=MAIL mail/[],
        SAX  /poseidon/lucio/mail/.Sax/[],
        etc.etc.

this way when I fill Fcc: via control-T, it constructs a full path, and 
the mail is then saved there.

Nevertheless the ^T way is a bit clumsy (the other way, saving to a 
temporary folder in the MAIL collection, and then moving from there to 
destination is worse).


Is there anything wrong with what I am doing ?
Is this a feature going to be fixed in 3.92, or perhaps already fixed in
3.91 ? (we are still using 3.89, me under Ultrix).

Slovenia.  See ISO3166 for the whole list.
Btw, the three letter code "com" stands for the "Comores".  :-)

I have the third edition of the iso3166 as of 940210 where the latest
addition was the "Kingdom of Cambodia"(kh) on 940126.

And before someone asks - "de" is neither "Denmark" nor "Delaware".

RFC-822 is clearly intended to apply to messages that go across a
network.  It does not apply to the message that pine feeds to an MTA on
the current host.

There is no requirement that pine be RFC-821-conforming.  Since all
known MTAs will accept mail via SMTP for delivery to a local mailbox
without requiring domain format, we conclude that:

   Pine behaves the way it does because that's how its authors want it
   to behave.  This has nothing to do with RFCs.

Date: Thu, 16 Nov 1995 13:31:13 GMT
Message-Id: <48i3og$b1b@mn5.swip.net>

Hi all. I have a amall problem that my netprovider cannot answer..

I am using Pine 3.91 wich was in the Linux 2.3 distribution that I've
installed.

Now. I have set a remote INBOX like this:

	{my.mail.host.address}INBOX

and that seems to work fine with the connection to the host. But as
soon as I open Pine and connects to the remote INBOX, there is a
process starting, probably started by Pine:

	rsh my.mail.host.address exec /etc/rimapd

That is that it tries to start a imap deamon on the host(not sure if I
got the path right there)??? Then the system stops until I, as root,
kill the rsc process.

When I killed the process and return to PineI see a line that says I
must write my account-name for the mail host and the password.

Now.. The questions:

	1: Why is Pine trying to start a remote imap deamon? 
	    Can I prevent that and how do I fix that problem?
	
	2: Is there any way to tell Pine my account name and password for the
	    host so Pine will put that in automagically when I connect to the 
	    mailhost.

Please, help me.. Any suggestions are welcome.

PS. Please respond via email, because I have had some problems with
news to.

Thanks in advance.  Ake Jonsson.

Are there any plans for this ?  We currently are looking for an e-mail 
reader client that supports IMAP and has unix, vms, mac and windows versions.

The closest thing is Pine so far, except for the mac version.

Any info on other e-mail clients is strongly appreciated.

I have installed mkpgp and everything with the installation and the config 
seems to be fine. The problem I have is that whenever pine tries to invove the
alternate editor, I get the message 'Read xx lines'  where xx is the number of
lines in the mail (headers and .signature), then it goes back into the 'normal'
mode with the cursor sitting in the Subject header.  Everytime I try to go down
into the main body, this happens.  Any ideas what could be happening?  Anyone
with a similar problem?

We have sparc-sun-solaris2.4 with pine3.91. We tried both the

the same:

After composing a message I type ^X, and pine hangs forever with the
message

Writing Fcc...

But pine hangs also when I postpone or save a message --- or any
operation we tried. We can have a limited use of pine though by
setting the suitable variables  to "" but then, of course, we cannot
save or postpone a message.

Any help is appreciated!

Hi!
I'm new to Internet and I have some problems recognize commands of pine 
system. Can anybody help me, please and answer the following questions?

A) What is the purpose of the "chmod" command?
B) What command is able to find spelling errors in a file?
C) What command compares two sorted files?

Thank you in advance!
Adam.

I selected the 'signature at bottom' configuration, but when I reply (and 
the original message is automatically inserted) my signature is at the top.


Am I doing something wrong or is this a known bug (pine 3.91)?

Thanks

Message-Id: <48jqoa$ip3@psuvax1.cse.psu.edu>

Hi.. a quick question for all of you. As many would notice, everytime you hit
a wrong key, or you get new mail, PINE beeps at you. Normally, I wouldn't
care, except, I usually read/send mail late at night, and my roomate's a light
sleeper <Well, my PC speaker's kinda loud too. ;-)>. What I want is a way to
tell PINE to "shut up", so it doesn't beep. My TERMCAP is set for ":vb=:",
thus shutting up EMACS, but I'd very much like to do so to PINE also. Any help
is appreciated. If there's no way to do this, perhaps someone could suggest a
contact address where I could mail the author(s) to both make the suggestion
and inquire for a solution.

Relevant information:

Ultrix 4.4
PINE 3.90
TCSH 6.00.02
VT102 <TERMCAP set>

Thanks, in advance. :-)

-Hi everybody!

I have a problem with the spellchecking when editting a message with pico. I
use pine 3.91 under linux with ispell, and when I go to the spellchecker the
ispell usage message appears, but it does not perform the checking. Can someone
tell me if it is possible to make it work?
Thanks, R. Tanas

There are two possiblities:

1) You can have pine change the FROM line as a customized header IF that 
functionality is compiled into pine.  The file you need to change is: 

pine3.91/pine/osdep/os-xxx.h

Just change the flag ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and recompile.

2) THE SENDMAIL SOLUTION:

Set up sendmail's USERDB and verify that it works when you use sendmail 
directly or with some other MUA such as "elm".

Then, in your /etc/sendmail.cf file, add the following line before the 
rulesets.  (I put mine right after the line saying "Kdequote dequote" and 
before the "Special Macros" section"):


# Define our userdb file for pine rewrites
Kuserdb btree -o /etc/userdb.db


Then, add the following ruleset #1.  (I put mine right after Ruleset 0):

##################################################
### Ruleset 1, rewrite sender header & envelope ##
##################################################
#Thanks to Bjart Kvarme <bjart.kvarme@usit.uio.no>
S1
R$- < @ $=w . > $*      $: $1 < @ $2 . > $3 ?? $1       username@localhost ?
R$+ ?? $+               $: $1 ?? $(userdb $2 : mailname $: @ $)
R$+ ?? @                $@ $1                           Not found
R$+ ?? $+               $>3 $2                          Found, rewrite

#NOTE      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#          Use Tab Characters  Use Tab Characters in these regions
# to make three columns (the line with "mailname" only has 2 columns).

This is how mine is set up and it works great without having to alter
pine's code.  (Although, I did find it it helpful to add the following to
either the system wide pine.conf, pine.conf.fixed, or your personal
.pinerc: 

user-domain=localhost

since I still had some troubles without that line.  Try it both with and 
without this pine setting.  NOTE: I literally used 'localhost', I did not 
use my local hostname.)

I hope this helps.

Well, I guess my response to this would be either a compile-time option, 
or a configuration option to suppress "@userdomain".  If the default is 
to include "@userdomain", then theoretically, only those administrators who 
know that their MTA (such as sendmail) will take care of adding 
"@userdomain" would configure pine to omit it.

Although it would be nice if all MTAs would handle this situation, the 
facts are that most don't (based on my limited experience).  The other 
unfortunate reality, is that getting the makers of an MTA to make a 
change to handle a quirk about one MUA (ie. pine) is not always the 
easiest thing to do.

But despite this "drawback" of pine, I still think it's the best MUA out 
there.  (And I do know how to get sendmail's USERDB to work with pine if 
anyone is interested.)

I've got a similar, slightly harder problem:  my client has a lot of
Wyse 50's attached to an HP machine running HP-UX 10.0.  Is there ANY
way to get reasonable behavior out of pine and pico in this environment,
or any good alternative mail reader?

It's rather more complicated than that.  Besides the user interface
question (how is J. Random User supposed to know the "right" setting?)
there would be a significant amount of code that needs to be changed.  The
concept of "not having a host name in an email address" simply does not
exist in the code.  That concept would have to be created, probably by
having a special host name that really isn't a host name.

There are further implications of this for POP and IMAP.  How is an absent
host name treated for data which resides on a different machine, given
that POP or IMAP servers are not necessarily in the same mailbox name
cluster as the client?

If you review the header-people archives from the late 1970s and early
1980s, this was a very controversial issue.  But the final concensus that
emerged was "death to unqualified addresses".  There were just too many
things that didn't work.

> Although it would be nice if all MTAs would handle this situation, the

The interpretation of this is that Pine is asked to trust an MTA that is
demonstrably not smart enough to be smart enough, and that furthermore a
user (or site admin), most of whom would *not* understand the technical
issues involved, is asked to judge whether or not this configuration would
work properly.

In turn, we are asked to add a feature that, when misapplied, would make
Pine substantially less robust.  As matters stand now, Pine works.  It may
not exploit a feature of a minority of MTAs, but it isn't broken either.

Yet, the designers of these MTAs are making the assumption that all MUAs
are old software designed to a mid-1970s idea of how "local vs. ARPAnet
mail" work.  How can you say that "strict conformance to RFC 822" is a
"quirk about one MUA"?

My undertanding is that (at least in the case of sendmail) the MTA
designers just didn't consider the possibility of an MUA doing things
"right", or thought that those MUAs would not need USERDB.  In other
words, it's an oversight, not design.

Please understand that we're not saying you shouldn't use USERDB.  It's a
nice feature.  Given that you have sources for both the MUA and the MTA in
question, you can do it yourself without cooperation from the designers of
either.  But from an engineering standpoint, wouldn't it make more sense
to fix the MTA?  It shouldn't hurt the MTA in any way; but the MUA's
designers have (what they feel to be) excellent reasons to feel that it
would hurt the MUA.

As far as "easy to do", it's not easy to ask us to add a feature that we
know will be easily misued, and will cause improper performance and
generate bug reports when misused.  We get too many bug reports every day
as it is -- we'd like to reduce the incoming flow, thankyousir!!!

Thanks for the compliments, and it may be valuable to post your technique
to the net.  If that technique involves "how to change sendmail so that
USERDB works with Pine" as opposed to "how to change Pine to work with
unmodified sendmail USERDB", we may add your description of the technique
to our technical notes.  We'd also ask our friends the sendmail designers
to make that change standard in the next version of sendmail.  From what I
know about the sendmail designers, they would be sympathetic to our

Along these lines, is there any way to set up a *directory* or number of 
.sigs for use within Pine, automatically seleted either upon startup or 
upon replying/forwarding/bouncing?  Tin has this option by specifying a 
*directory* where random .sigs can be found in place of an actual 
.signature file.  Can pine do this?

Hi!  Can someone tell me if there is a way to "Take the Address" of an 
incoming Pine message, and put it automatically into a Distribution List?
Sometimes when writing in newsgroups, you will get a lot of people e-mailing
for a synopsis or whatever -- it would be very handy if you could just 
take their names into a Distribution List.

I've also wondered if there is a Top of File/End of File instead of 
having to hit ^Y/^V over and over.

When a message is viewed, it scrolls one screen's worth at a time. Is
there any way to make the scroll continuous (for purposes of direct
capture by Procomm, for example)? I was thinking in terms of a print
command of some kind - the Y option with the right setup. Maybe option 3
under print setup with the correct unix command. I have no printer
attached, but can the output be sent to the screen in some way? 

Thanks.

I wpuld like to configure Pine to use a From: header different than my unix account 
name (I wish to use my central mail alias which runs in another domain.)  How can I 
do this?  I will recompile it if I have to, but I think with many people using mail 
aliases and forwarding, this should be a standard feature.

I know about the Reply-To option, but I would rather do this instead.

Thanks so much for your help.

I was just transferring files with ftp when I got a message onto screen 
about new mail. I switched to an another virtual console and started pine 
to read my mail. I, however, did not disconnected my connection with ftp.
When I started that pine session it said:

              Folder INBOX opened with 1 message READONLY

Now I keep getting same annoying message when I try to open any folder in 
my mail directory. Does anyone know where lies that f***ing lock file?
And what's a name for it? Or is there some other thing guilty for this?

I need assistance with an annoying problem I have been  having.  I 
apologize early on if this has been discussed in the list but I only 
became aware of the pine-info group recently.  I have communicated with 
the BSDUnix people on this problem, read the Pine FAQ, the documentation, 
and the Release and Technical notes.  But I still have not found out how 
to solve the problem.

I am running version 2.0.1 of BSD and am having a peculiar problem with 
pine.  When I reply to a message, the following flashes quickly at the 
bottom of the screen  "Lookup file /var//tmp/aXXXXXXX, doesn't exist, 
creating", where XXXXXXX is a number.  It then allows me to continue to 
respond to the message.  As far as I can tell the recipients are 
receiving the messages.  
 
I can think of nothing unusual except that at one point, after I had 
added only a few users (including mine), I created the file that allows 
the system operater to set pine configuration setting permanently for 
everyone (pine.conf.fixed).  But I had problems when that file existed too (everytime a user logged in it asked if the 
user wanted to move the current months sent-mail to a folder named after 
the previous month.  On the next log in it asked the user if he wanted to 
delete the previous month's sent-mail.  These two messages rotated 
everytime a user logged in). 

So I erased that permanent configuration file 
and created the pine.conf file.  Now I'm wondering if that has anything 
to do with the problem I'm having now.  It seems that I get the message 
only when I reply to a message, not when I compose a new message.  Also, 
it seems that it only happens when I respond to certain users, not 
everyone but I can't track whether I only get the message when responding 
to users whose accounts were created when mine was created or if I also 
get it when I respond to accounts created after the permanent 
configuration file was deleted and replaced with pine.conf.  Or does none 
of this have anything to do with the problem.  I understand that a lookup 
process occurs when an email message is created but I'm not quite sure 
which files are involved.  Could that be the problem?
 
The files the message says are being created are in fact created by the 
system in /var/tmp.  However, I am not listed as the owner of the file.  
Other users are.
 
Is this a serious problem?  And how can I correct it?

Hi!
When I use <r>eply to answer a post, and I want to include the original 
post, if my addition is to short, the post won't get posted.   I  get 
a message that the original post was longer than the additional text, so 
it can't be posted.  Is there any way to change the configuration, so 
that even small addition will be get posted? (usefull for example if it's 
a string post, where consecutive answers are added to a pile of posts...)
	Please send an answer to the above E-mail.
						Thanks,
							Ahuva

Will there be a way to pipe a message into pine in 3.92, so that pine can
be used as mailer in tin etc? I need the addressbook function etc
for mailing out posts, but pine does not allow me to start in composer
mode *and* automatically fill the buffer with a file...

I'd like to see:

	cat msg | pine address

or
	pine -F msg address

to preload msg into the buffer and then start the composer.

The current
	pine -F file address

does not do what I want

I use pine on a VAX system (3.91) and my wife uses it on a UNIX system
(3.91-FP). For some reason, when my wife uses the mailer it asks her if she
wants to create a folder if the folder does not exist yet. My version of pine
does not do so. What option do I need to set or unset?

Try making /usr/bin/spell the following file instead of a link to ispell:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#! /bin/sh
#
# A front-end to ispell which allows it to act like the "spell" program
# By: Christopher Neufeld <neufeld@caliban.physics.utoronto.ca>
#

case $# in
        0)      ispell -l | sort | uniq ;;
        *)      cat $@ | ispell -l | sort | uniq ;;
esac
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will make the command "spell" behave like the typical unix spell 
command.

To actually use ispell with its list of suggested words, you can make 
ispell the alternate editor by adding the following to your .pinerc:

editor=/usr/bin/ispell -x

Hope that helps.

Is there any Pine for Windows 95?

Or is there any mail reader that can download new mail from a POP server 
without deleting it.

What I want is a mail reader that can download unread mail from a POP server, 
not merely download the whole chunk of mail or duplicating it if there is 
already one in the local PC

Any information is very much appreciated.

Someone kindly sent me a .zip file via MIME attachmenet (it's a file of
upgraded drivers for the HP ScanJet 3c and Windows95) but when I
attempt to 'V'iew the attachment to save as a file, I received this
message from Pine:

  Don't know how to display attachment format Application/OCTET-STREAM

I'm not familiar with this.  Haven't had a single problem in the past
regarding MIME attachments of .zip files so I'm wondering if anyone has
insight regarding this.  I'd surely like to get at this zip file, I
need those drivers.

Thanks.

Hello,

I'm using PINE 3.91 for a long time now and I would like
to know if there is or will be any development on PINE. 
The two things I wish most are speed-up of PINE (don't
read the whole mailbox but only an index to the messages)
and an integration of PGP.

Hi,

I've just downloaded PC-PINE for Windows but don't know how to configure it to 
work with the Unix mail server.

I have a UnixWare 2.01 server running, SMTP is up and so is POP3 server.

I've configured PC-PINE with the correct SMTP server and domain name.
But everytime, I got a message that says "connection refused".

What should I do?

Help is much appreciated.

    This does not seem to be a problem of Pine as such.  Pine is a Mail 
USER Agent (MUA), but it has to hand off the outgoing mail to a Mail 
TRANSFER Agent (MTA), and some MTAs apply the restriction to which you 
are referring.  Fortunately, my system's MTA does not, but sometimes when 
I post to a moderated newsgroup, the moderator's MTA bounces it if I do 
not count words and lines correctly, even if I am quoting a bit more than 
my reply just to provide proper context without having to resort to 
paraphrase.  Drives me nuts!

    Yes!  Use ^W^Y and ^W^V .

I have a problem regarding the fully qualified address. 
The fully qualified address is either john@system.com OR 
system.com!john. According to the standards, 
the address is node!user or user@node, both are same.
But pine is not allowing to enter the address as 
node!user, As soon as I enter node!user, pine appends the
local domain name to it, assuming it is a local address.
The same problem will come when we receive a mail from 
system.com!user, we will not be able to use the reply 
option , because of the appended local domain name.


For this, any configuration setup has to be done ???

Pl. Can any one help in this matter ???

I tried using the pop server that came with unixware 2.00 with similar 
results.  Qualcom has a unixware version that I am using.

Good luck,

1.  Use Pine 3.91

2.  Go into Setup Configuration screen and enable 
"enable-aggregate-command-set" feature.  Read its on-line help whilst there.

3.  Return to Index screen.

4.  Select all messages:  ; A

5.  Delete the selected messages:  A D

In future just use steps 4 and 5.

In Pine's default editor (PICO) it's ^T (control+t), but I'm not sure 
that's your question?

Again, not a PINE question but a UNIX question, and without knowing more

It seems, that Pine authors insist on user@domain being the ONLY valid
form of address. So God help UUCP (and not only) users.

I've been wondering how to get Pine and PGP to work together happily.
They don't seem to want to.
Any tips will be much loved.

I use Pine from a dial-in e-mail provider.  It is running on a UNIX 
machine.  I'd like to edit my .signature file but I cannot find
any way to do this; when I exit from Pine my dial-in session is 
terminated. 

Can I start vi, for instance, from within Pine?  

Thanks

Subject: PCPine and name-lookup

Message-Id: <48qc94$hg9@ratatosk.uio.no>

We are using PC-Pine 3.91 with PC-NFS 5.1X (which uses DNS lookup)
Each users configuration file (pinerc) is located at the network
disk which is mounted on the PC when the user logs in.
(told to Pine by set pinerc=Drive:\pine\pinerc)
It seems that one out of four installations does not work.
It looks like Pine is having a hard time looking up the server.

While starting it will say something like "getting information on 
mail address" etc ending in: <nameofhost> host not found. Which version
of PC-NFS (5.1 a/b) that is running does not seem to matter.

I moved the local Pine-files from a working installation to a problem-child
(as we have had som CRC-trouble on network installations).
It did not help.

I had my home directory with my pinerc mounted on the %$&"#&#$ PC,
it did not work (even though it works beautifully on my PC).

I made sure all the other services using DNS worked, that all the servers 
were valid, up, and running named.

I _did_ check that imapd was running well on the local host.

What I hate about this is that I cannot seem to find the similarities 
between the installations not working.

Does anyone have any ideas out there?

Hi, I have created a list called "ic" with pine.  I would like all mail
coming to my account to be forwarded to the users on ic.  Is there a way
to do this?

    It may depend on how Pine is configured for your system.  You might 
try entering Ctrl-Z from within Pine.  If your Pine is configured to 
allow this, Pine will be suspended and put in the background, putting you 
at your Unix shell prompt.  Then you can use vi to edit whatever you 
want.  To resume Pine, just enter 'fg' at the shell prompt.  As for using 
vi from _within_ Pine, you can do this for editing original messages and 
replies, but I'm not sure you can do it to edit an "independent" file.

Hi Robert,

if you go from the (M)ain Menu to (S)etup and choose (C)onfig you can set an alternative editor.

Oops, that was the second part of your question:-)

You can always fake an editor by replying to any email you have and calling the external editor
(I'm sorry, I've made pico my standard, but there is a ^something for this, look at the command-list
at the bottom).

Once your in, delete all text, write your .forward text and save the actual file as .forward
(When leaving the editor, make sure *NOT* to send the file!)

BUT: You must have a home-directory on the providers system, which is NOT common! So check this out.

Ciao,
 Michael

When attempting to expunge deleted items from my "inbox" folder, pine thinks
there are more items to be expunged than there really are and fails to delete
anything. If I try and expunge on a quit, pine will occasionally crash.
This is not always consistent although always fails on the same items.

I can manipulate the folder using MH primitives but these cannot cope 
with the volume which is high. pine _seems_ to be OK on other folders.

I've searched the filestore in case pine has some "special" file where it 
can store information like this but have found nothing. Running a trace 
and using debug level 9 doesn't seem to get me any further apart from 
showing that some pointers (in the general sense) have been trashed.

   It seems, that Pine authors insist on user@domain being the ONLY valid
   form of address. So God help UUCP (and not only) users.

The problem might be more apparent than actual.  I just performed a
test, using alw.nih.gov!rick as the recipient address.  Pine appended
@helix.nih.gov as per the above, but delivery was made to alw.
Evidently our sendmail configuration stripped the superfluous local
hostname.

Hope this helps,

There's only one feature of elm that I miss in pine.  In elm, you could set up
an alias for a bunch of email addresses, compose a letter to that alias, and
elm would resolve it into everyone on the list before mailing it.

For example, I could set up an alias for one of my classes (let's call it junk)
and add the email addresses of everyone in my class to that alias.  Then, I
could send email to junk, and elm would expand it from the aliases and mail
it to everyone in the class.

Is there any way to do this in pine?

thanks,
chris

We are using Pine 3.91 on a Sun with Solaris 2.4.  We also have a Usenet
news server running on Linux.

Whenever our Usenet News host goes down, Pine users get hung up at the
main menu as Pine is "building folder list".  We know that this is
because when a user sets up his/her folders to read Usenet articles, and
the News server is down, Pine looks indefinitely for the news host and
just hangs.

Is there an option in pine.conf that will get around this?  I usually end
up swapping versions of Pine from 3.91 to 3.89 until the News host is
back up again, but I'd rather have the problem fixed.

Thanks

    Pine will not do this.  (It wasn't designed to.)  If you are on some 
version of Unix, you can use the forward facility (read about it with 
'man forward') provided you want to forward every single piece of mail 
that arrives at your account tro one other addressee.  Otherwise you will 
have to use some sort of preprocessing software such as procmail or filter.

Can someone tell me the name some groups to describe to that will help me

What do you mean by "there are more items to be expunged than there really
are"?

Can you provide any other information?  Do you mean that this only happens

There's no special file; deleted status is in memory.

We are using Pine 3.91 on a Sun with Solaris 2.4.  We also have a Usenet
news server running on Linux.

Whenever our Usenet News host goes down, Pine users get hung up at the
main menu as Pine is "building folder list".  We know that this is
because when a user sets up his/her folders to read Usenet articles, and
the News server is down, Pine looks indefinitely for the news host and
just hangs.

Is there an option in pine.conf that will get around this?  I usually end
up swapping versions of Pine from 3.91 to 3.89 until the News host is
back up again, but I'd rather have the problem fixed.

Thanks

    Pine does not do this kind of prescreening.  You need to use software 
which will screen your mail before Pine opens it.  On Unix systems, 
procmail and filter are fairly popular.

    Pine will not do this.  (It wasn't designed to.)  If you are on some

Pine is kind of dumb about this.  If you are Taking only a single address
it figures you want to add a simple entry to your address book instead of
to a distribution list.  If you are taking more than one address, it gives
you the opportunity to add to a list.  There is a workaround of sorts.  If
you Select the message with the ; command, and then do Apply Take instead
of just Take, it will allow you to add to a list.  Pine 3.92 will work
better.  Thanks.

Subject: Tab with MH incoming message folders
Date: 21 Nov 1995 07:23:29 GMT
Message-Id: <48ruph$jce@usenet.pa.dec.com>

I've recently installed MH and converted all my pine folders to MH folders.
Also, I'm using procmail to separate my list server mail into incoming
message folders.  Everything seems to work just fine except for one thing.
When I try to tab to the next folder with unread messages, pine thinks that 
there are no incoming message folders with unread messages.  I see it quickly
cycle through all the incoming message folders and say that there are no
more incoming messages folders.  When I list the folders and go to a 
specific folder, there are clearly unread messages.  Does this really work
with MH folders?  I sure hope I can fix this.  It's very boring manually
visiting potentially empty folders.  Thanks.

Bonjour

Trying to see if pine would "quote printe" a text instead of using base64, I 
was quite mixed.

First it Pine documentation we have the following;

****
MIME has two ways of encoding data-Quoted-Printable and Base64
...
All attachments are encoded using Base64 encoding. 
...
****
But when I read the news groups articles called *BIT or Quoted-Printable in 
PIne ref* it looks like we can "Quote Printe" a text file.

Anyone can clear that for me: can I send a attached text in "quote printable"?

It seems that the date sorting in Pine's news reader doesn't quite work
correctly (in 3.91). The ordering is close, but not just right. Also,
postings with the same date are not ordered correctly. Is this a known
bug? (I'm using the AIX version.)

Has anyone written a checkalias (like the elm one)
 tool for pine addressbooks? I'd like to access my aliases from
outside pine. 

If not I think a perl script will do, but why reinvent the wheel?

Here's how.  From the main menu, hit "A" for address.  Inside the address
menu, hit "S" to create a list.  You will be asked for a name for the list
(e.g., "Junk 101"), a nickname ("junk") and then you will be asked to
enter all the e-mail addresses for the list.  Save the list.  Now,
whenever you're sending e-mail to everybody in the list, just send it to
"junk" and Pine will expand "junk" and send the e-mail to everybody on the
list.

hello all

is there a maximum number of recipients that I can add to a list?

I created a list with about 100 recipients and some didn't receive the 
mails. (pine-3.91 on SunOS 4.1.2)

Subject: a peculiarity with pine on sunos 4.1.1

Hi guys,

I compiled the entire pine/pico/imapd package on a sunos4.1.1 successfully.

However, with pine, within the index list of any folder, I am unable to 
jump to any message item by simply typing the number of the message. My 
experience with pine on other platforms is to be able to do this. 

I guess it is possible that you might have run into similar observations.
Am I missing a file on my sunos platform, I mean other than the
pine/pico/imapd package? 

Your help is appreciated and if there is some pine related question I can 
answer, I would sure like to help you out aswell.

Thanks.

You can define a list in your addressbook(s), for more information read 
the help-text of the address-books...

Hope it helps

Why are we getting multiple copies of this message?

If you have the following set in your .pinerc it will work, although I 
personally find that vi and pine don't work too well together:-(

# Editor to use in place of Pine's internal composer, Pico
editor=/usr/ucb/vi

and 

enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

and

enable-alternate-editor-cmd   

(although this is included in the old-growth set)

Use Setup/Config to set them.

[This probably isn't the only/correct way, but it works.]

I don't know the answer, so I have more questions. If there is a limit,
it's not mentioned in any of the help files.  Are the same people not
receiving the mail each time?  Are they the first or the last names on the
list?  I suppose you could split your list into two lists.  What is the
largest size list that people have used successfully?

Your observations are correct, and this will most likely be a long-term
deficiency with MH folder support.  The MH folder system does not provide
any place to maintain some of the information which Pine likes to maintain
about messages and the folder.  Much of this information is inferred, but
other information lasts only as long as the session lasts.

Here's the technical explanation, if your're interested:

Two of the interesting states of a message related to "newness" are the
"recent" and "seen" state of a message.  "Recent" is defined to mean "this
message appeared in the folder since the previous session"; "seen" is
defined to mean "the user has read this message in some way".  In formats
such as mbox or tenex, there are specific state flags kept in each message
that contain these (and other) states.

An addition semantic of "recent" messages is that the number of "recent"
messages should be available quickly.

"Recent" and "seen" are independent status.

With MH, both "recent" and "seen" are inferred from information read from
the folder directory (via readdir()) and file inodes (via stat()).  There
is no storage for the status in the message files themselves; nor would it
be particularly beneficial to do so because it'd be too slow to read it
from all the files.

The upshot of this is that in MH, "recent" means "this message appeared in
the folder since the start of *this* session" and "seen" is defined to
mean "the user has read the message during this sesson and/or the Unix
access time of the message file is greater than the Unix modification time
of the file".  A message can appear in the folder either because Pine
itself has transferred the file from /usr/spool/mail/$USER to the user's
#mhinbox, or because some other program has done so.

The TAB command in Pine checks a count of "recent" messages.  When just
scanning folders, this count will always be zero, hence the behavior that
you observed.

Something is wrong.  I have installed the binary pine from UWash on several
Solaris 2.3 and 2.4 machines.  Sorry I can't be more helpful.

Are you using a Macintosh? Are you using NCSA Telnet? A lot depends on 
what software you're using to access the server you run pico from.

If you *are* using a Macintosh, the Control-O dilemma can be avoided by 
pressing Command-S (same as apple-S) when in NCSA Telnet then changing one 
of the Keys from control-O to something else.  This will only work, of course,
if one of those is set to control-O, which I have found is the case in many
situations.  This is also a good place to start if Emacs isn't working
properly (C-x C-c doesn't work because Interrupt Process is set to control-c).

There is no limit in pine, but the interaction between pine and sendmail
sometimes causes problems by overflowing fixed sized buffers in sendmail.
If you can try setting smtp-server in the Setup/Config screen, that should
get around the problem.  That uses a different method to figure out who
the recipients are, so doesn't run into the same buffer overflow.  You
can try

smtp-server=localhost

as a first attempt.  If that doesn't work, try setting it to the actual
hostname of the host you are on.  If that doesn't work, try setting it to
the hostname of some other smtp server you have access to.

I had this happen to me recently, except that it was for some Global
Village modem prefs which GV had e-mailed to me from their AOL account.
The APPLEFILE did a very strange thing when I finally got it onto my mac.
I used pine's viewer function to save it as a file on our unix box and
then sent it to our apple via sz on modem. When I launched it, this little
1 kilobyte file started up *and played* the complete Dark Forces Demo,
which is usually 3+ MB in size! There are two alternative explanations for
this. 1) Apple has produced the best form of compression ever devised and
strangely kept it under its hat or 2) somehow, the part of the file that
tells the mac where to look for the rest of everything and what to do with
it somehow gets divorced from the rest of the application when mac files
go through (AOL?)/MIME/pine. In my case, this little snippet of a file
might have allied itself with the Dark Forces Demo which was adjacent to
it on the hard drive or something. Obviously, I have no hard facts on the
matter, but I am very interested in what is going on here. I was truly
astounded to find myself playing Dark Forces when I had intended to
install a small extension to the system! For reference, the rest of the
file (the data fork) which was untimely ripped from the Applefile, did not
work, although I seem to recall that it was editable with teachtext. 

Carla, on a practical aside, have your friend send you the GIF as a
binhexed file from his mac. That should solve the transfer problem. 

For you dudes and dudettes at washington.edu, I am using pine 3.91 for sgi
on a Pers. Iris 4D/35 running IRIX 4.0.5.

Mark -

Are you saying that the Tab key actually scans for the next Recent
message?  If so, Pine's Help screen for the Folder Index intriguingly
says the following: 

: MESSAGE TEXT Screen Commands   B  Bounce                       *  Flag
: ----------------------------
:  G   Goto a specified folder     General Pine Commands

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Apologies if I've misunderstood your comment and got hold of the wrong end

   This is my problem as well: on SunOS 4.1.3, ^O doesn't work. On NeXTSTEP
3.3 for Intel, it does. Really strange. (For those who do not know, ^O saves
text without exitting - as opposed to ^X).

   Bye Borek.

  Using out copy of pine ^o (not zero) does work.  Could you be trying a 
zero instead of an 'o'?
  Just a thought.

'ksh: pico: cannot execute'

I am on an HP-UX machine and that is the version of the binary that
I am running.  I expect that pine will do the same.  Anyone had a
similar problem?

I guess you could fake it. Start composing, get into vi (if you're not
already in it) via the alternate-editor command, and then use ":edit

I'm also looking for this.  On a similar thread, someone suggested 
READMAIL, which I found and tried out.  Go to http://vsl.cnet.com and 
search on readmail.

The only problem with READMAIL is that none of the listing options 
show the TO field.  Often, I need to search through old mail folders 
(stored on my pc) for a particular message I sent someone.  READMAIL 
is not set up to do this.  A search with an ASCII editor is the usual 
course of action.

What I would like (I probably should add this to the next version of Pine 
wishlist thread) is a new command line switch for PC-Pine for an archive 
use.  

Right now, if you don't have the network drivers loaded, PC-Pine dumps 
you out and refuses to start.  It would be nice to be able to start 
PC-Pine with a command line switch so we can just use it to read our old 
mail folders, with the full folder command set, so we can create a new 
folder, scan old folders, copy particular messages to the new folder...

This would allow a DOS window to my Unix server with Pine running and my 
current folders available, and then another DOS window with PC-Pine (in 
read mode) reviewing my old folders on the local machine.

Hope someone on the Pine development team sees this.  Thanks.

Mike,
There is an inconsistency between what TAB does within a folder, and what
it does *between* folders.  The help text is correct for the first case,
but when you are at or past the last *new* message in a folder and press
TAB, it will scan the incoming folder list looking for the next folder
with any *recent* messages in it.

We have debated whether this behavior is "correct", but that's the way it
works today.

Jim,
It's true that PC-Pine does not yet have an offline mode (this is planned
for next year and involves downloading pending mail, plus queing pending
replies), but I would have expected that pc-pine with the -f flag
would have worked for your needs...

Hmm... on this NeXTSTep 3.3 for Intel, it crashes when I go control-o, 
but I'm also using a weird double dialin connection before I get here.

Dear friends:

	I am new to this list, so I apologize if this question has been 
asked and answered before.  I access my internet server from a Windows 
3.1 environment, access a UNIX shell server with vi command capability, 
and use PINE 3.89.  
	How do I save a message from my inbox (or any folder) to a floppy disk?

Yes, that's right... I neglected to mention that TAB stops at either NEW
(unseen) or IMPORTANT messages within a folder.

It seems to be not QUITE so. If I press TAB in a folder, I jump to the 
next MARKED message (not neccessarily NEW). It could be e.g. Important 
(marked with *). At least it is so by me. I am using 3.91 for Windows; 
all folders are remote.

Is the behavior correct?

Did you check to make sure that you told pine the path to your signature file
relative to your home directory?  There's a line in the Main/Setup/Config
window, right before that long list of options that reads:

	signature-file         =

You need to enter the path and name of your sig file.  For example, mine reads

	signature-file         = .sig

This must be set in addition to toggling the signature-at-bottom option.

Hope this helps :)

Seeya,

Paul

Date: 22 Nov 1995 19:09:44 GMT
Message-Id: <48vsho$31@swlab1.msd.ray.com>

Quick question here.  A user recently asked me if there were a way to 
supress the From ot To line when mailing to a list.

For example, if I create a list of addresses in Pine, and compose a message
to this list of people, is there a way that I can configure pine to only
show that I'm composing a message to the list name without showing me who's on
that list?

When I mail to a list, I currently see this:

	To : listname - name@address1,
		name2,
		name3,
		etc.

What I'd like to see is this:

	To : listname
	Cc :
	etc.
	----- Message Text -----

By the same token, when some one on the list receives the mail, they should be
able to see just:

	From : listname

and also be able to toggle between a long listing of the From line the above
described shorter listing.  If this isn't currently possible, can it be a
possible feature in a later release?

Thanks for your time and effort,

Paul

P.S.	If it is currently possible, can you point me to the proper docs?  I
	tried to rtfm, but didn't find anything :(

    If you want to save a single message (mail or newsgroup posting), 
probably the simplest way is to use the export command to save it in an 
individual Unix file.  Then exit Pine and just download that file the way 
you would any other.  (There is no single way to do this: it depends on 
what software is available to both your shell account and Windows, so I 
cannot give general instructions applicable to everybody.)  Remember to 
delete the exproted copy of the file.

    You can also download every message in a folder at once, if you wish, 
simply because a folder is itself a single Unix ASCII file.  Just change 
to the directory in which your folders reside and download the whole 
folder by name.

In a previous article, hubert@cac.washington.edu (Steve Hubert) says:

    A good name to try for this is

smtp-server=mailhost

This will work if your organization or school has a central mail server
which is intended to handle most mail, and it's been given the nickname
of mailhost -- a generic, easy-to-remember name and a nice practice to
follow.
If this doesn't work, you'll have to use a specific name of an smtp server.

    Note too that one can specify a number of servers; in the event one of
them is down, unreachable, overloaded, or otherwise not functional, Pine
will try the next, and the next, and the next, until finally one responds.

smtp-server=mailhost, backup.host.our.edu, spam.i.am.com, localhost

hi,

	There is no such problem with other mail program so I think there

Why don't you read the question and the FRFC?

Not an answer. NAME is not an address. It appears as a comment in the
From: header.

I thought it wasn't the responsibility of the newsreader to do this. It
isn't an answer to the question anyway. He doesn't want to change the
From: header, he wants to change the address people reply to.

Here is the answer to the question. If you want to change the address
that people will send replies to, use the same editor that lets you edit
the message to insert the line "Reply-To: your.address@wherever.domain"
in the header.

What version of Pine do you have, and on what type of system?  This is
believed to be fixed in Pine 3.91.

Hello,

having compiled PINE 3.91 successfully on OSF/1 3.2 i have some
problems while accessing MH folders in $HOME/Mail.

Well, existing MH folders can be accessd with folder collection #mh/[].
But i'm not able to add a new folder. PINE says:
   [Can't create mailbox #mh/pinetest3: No such file or directory]
I'm afraid PINE constantly tries to work with $HOME/mail, and
#mh/Mail/[] doesn't work.

On the other hand if i set the folder to:

{my-server.dom.uni-jena.de/imap}#mh/[]

everything works o.k.

Well, i think in case of a remote folder IMAPd looks at my
$HOME/.mh_profile where $HOME/Mail (instead of $HOME/mail) is defined.


Can anyone give me a hint for specifying MH Dir/Folder locally.

Thanks in advance
Uwe

The applefile is of no use to you other than on a Mac.  Just 
ignore it.  However, the Image/GIF should be fine - just follow
the instructions for saving it to a disk file, and (if necessary) 
override the Mac filename that it offers you, with a filename 
that is appropriate on your own system.

What do you mean, "print" it?  If you want a paper copy, you'll
still need an application that can understand GIF image files on
your system.  Just sending a GIF-format image to a printer is not
likely to do anything useful.

Since you did not say what system you are using, it's hard to 
advise you.  If it's unix then you should get (if you don't 
already have) the shareware app "xv".  On a peecee you could
use Lview.  There are lots of other packagess that can do this, 
though.  There are usenet groups that deal specifically with
graphics/images: look in their FAQs for recommendations.

Good luck

Hi,

	When I dial-in to my university account and attempt to read my new  
email via Pine, I get mixed lines of characters and message headers on the  
screen making it unreadable, it seems to write over itself without  
refreshing the screen.  When I logon I set the term to VT100, is there a  
better emulation?  I'm using ZTerm and I believe it's setup properly.

Thanks for any information that you can provide,

ZTerm users on our system have reported the same problem.  All of the 
following contribute to the cure:
o Make sure you are using a recent version of ZTerm (preferably 1.0.1, 
  but at least 1.0b3).
o Make sure ZTerm is set for VT102 terminal emulation, not PC/ANSI.
o If possible on your host, select VT102 at login, not VT100.
o Make sure your terminal window is sized at 24 lines by 80 characters.  
  The current size is shown at the bottom of the window; drag the size box 
  until it is 24 X 80.
o Make sure you are using a monospaced font sized to fit the 24 X 80
  window size (typically Monaco 9 for a small screen, Monaco 12 for a
  large screen, or ZTerm's built-in "terminal font" in 9 pt or 12 pt).

I'm sorry if this is really an obvious question but I've been throught 
the help as much as I possibly can.  Here the q. 
I am limited to reading only 10-11 lines of text (header included) on my 
screen (menu keys would be lines 13-14). When in the main menu I don't 
see anything after the ADDRESS BOOK selection, meaning I just guess to 
find SETUP and EXIT.  Dis is really annoying. Now the real q is - What 
the fix? Is it my problem or the servers?
...
Thanks in advance!

We're planning to migrate all services  to a Windows NT

mail transfer agent?  At the moment mail is stored on vms
and read by pine clients via an IMAP deamon.

Is there a IMAP deamon for Windows NT?

Are there  bettter solutions ?

Hi,
     My PC-Pine for Windows gets News Groups and the Update files fine.  
But, it won't do mail at all.  And, I can't find the folders that it says 
it has setup on my PC.
     On the Configure menu what do you show as the INBOX?  The INBOX on 
the PC or the INBOX on the provider's UNIX machine.  On mine it would be 
/var/spool/mail/cwt.  My setup doesn't like that.  It accepts INBOX ok, 
but then says "closed due to access error."
     Any ideas will be appreciated.
                                      Thanks,
                                                Bill.

Has anyone compiled pine under sco 3.2.4.  I am having great problems 
with this.  It seems to be almost a catch-22.  If I compile with 
-posix, it fixes some things and breaks others.  If compile with -ansi 
also, fixes some, breaks some.  The major errors have to do with 
including syslog.h and the definitions of ushort and caddr_t (which are 
defined until you choose posix compliance.  Thanks!

The imap-4 toolkit has an alpha version of an imapd for NT.

it sure would be nice if the number of articles in a particular newsgroup
would show up in the folder list section menu. 

is there anyway of doing this with version 3.91?

or....consider ading to wish list<g>.

We have Pine-3.91 running sinds March 1995 on SCO 3.2v4.2.
Why did you compile with "-posix" ?

I think we used "build CC=cc sco"

If you like, I can send you the make-log to see what happened.

Yes, is works OK with MMDF...

Pine,
	I'm trying to find out how to retreive a message that was accidentally
deleted.  I read the FAQ, and I downloaded the http://www.cac.washington.edu
/pine  document, but I haven't found the answer yet.  Please respond, because
I need to know if I can get the message back.

Thank You,  Mark Burnell

We just upgraded to SunOS 5.4 and Pine 3.91 insists on creating a phony 
addressbook called .addressbook.lu

Config defaults to .addressbook.

Also, Pine won't save to folders or send FCC to sent-mail.   
addressbook.lu has 686 lines and looks something like this:

PC-Pine assumes your INBOX is on a mail server with an IMAP daemon
running.  The inbox path syntax would be something like

 inbox-path={imap.exis.net}inbox

By default, Pine saves your mail you send... Go into "L - Select Folder" 
and choose "Sent mail."

  .addressbook.lu is not a "phony addressbook."  It is deliberately 
created by Pine to make use of a large addressbook more efficient by 
means of a lookup table.  If Pine creates it, keep it.

    If you are using Pine 3.91, from the Main Menu go into Setup and 
Config.  On the first screen is a field called "default-fcc".  It gives 
the name of the folder to which all mails are automatically saved unless 
you override it for a particular mail.  Make sure that field is not set 
to "" or " ", either explicitly or by default.

MH does keeps track of whether a message has been seen or not, via the
'unseen' sequence.  Once the user defines this sequence in his
.mh_profile with a line like

     unseen-sequence: unseen

all the MH utilities will create, delete, and update this sequence as
needed.  Thus you can scan for all unseen messages with 'scan unseen',
or scan for all seen messages with 'scan ^unseen' (assuming you defined
the ^ character for sequence negation), or see all unseen messages with
'show unseen', etc.

Other software could well maintain other information, such as another
sequence called 'recent', though of course this would be neither used
nor updated by MH-specific utilities.  But since MH does maintain a
'cur' sequence that remembers which message was last read, it's not
clear to my why one needs 'recent' at all.  Assuming the user reads
messages sequentially, 'cur' will indicate where the user should
continue reading where he left off.

I will append below a portion of the 'man .mh_profile' online manual.

     Unseen-Sequence: unseen
               Names the sequences which should be defined as
               those messages recently incorporated by inc.  Show
               knows to remove messages from this sequence once
               it thinks they have been seen.  If not present, or
               empty, no sequences are defined.  Otherwise, for
               each name given, the sequence is first zero'd and
               then each message is added to the sequence.  (pro-
               file, no default)

If the message has simply been *marked for delete* (by using the "D" key) 
*and* hasn't yet been expunged (permanently deleted) by either quitting 
Pine, using the "X" command, or closing the mail folder to open another....

....then you can remove the "marked for delete" mark by 
reading/highlightimh the message and using the "U" (Undelete) key.  (It's 
shown in the menu at the bottom of the screen.)

HOWEVER....

If the mail folder has been expunged then the message is gone forever 
from the file in which your messages are stored.  It's just the same as 
if you remove a file on UNIX by typing "rm filename" -- it has gone.

In this case your only hope is to go and be exceedingly nice to your 
systems administrator and see if they may be able to restore the file 
from a recent backup of the computer.  This relies on them having taken a 
backup whilst the message existed in your mail file; if they didn't (say 
because you deleted the message soon after it arrived) then it is gone 
for good.

Your last hope would be to contact the sender and ask if they could send 
you the message again.

I am trying to configure PC-pine for my home box.  Is there a way to have 
Pine download my INBOX so it is local?  It's such a waste to have it grab 
an update everytime I do something.  Also, it has a tendancy to lock up 
my system.  Is it a bug or is it something to live with?

Is there a way to setup a blind carbon copy in pine that is totally transparent to
both the sender and recipient?  Ideally, I would only have to set this up once and
all of my outgoing messages would be sent to my other address for storage.

thanks for any suggestions,

No setup required, just sent mail and take a look in your "sent-mail" folder.

If you like to archive based on subject, address, or whatever, then select
one or more messages from there and save them in a corresponding folder name.

Here Pine has the same whatever_we_agree_to_call_it behaviour.

I am used to it, because if I forward messages, i want the reader to 
start with my introduction and then proceeds reading.

Ofcourse, you can temporarily save the message, and include it as an 
attachement when you send to your other party.

Keith,
	We've compiled Pine 3.91 on SCOv.3.2. I can't remember the exact
commands we used until I make some confirmations at work tomorrow.  I

I suppose Pine uses a string of a fixed size for an expanded alias.
Thus it certainly is limited.  ELM's limit is 5120 characters, btw.

I suggest you split up your group alias and send out the mail to the subgroups.

Hey!

	I access mail folder collections on several different systems 
through pcpine for Windows such that my setup/config screen looks similar 
to this:

folder-collections       = host1mail {host1.somewhere.net}host1mail/[]
                           host2mail {host2.somewhere.net}host2mail/[]
                           oldmail {host1.somewhere.net}oldmail/[]
                           homemail c:/ppp16/pcpine/jasafir/oldmail/[]

I have been unable to get pine to read folder collections on my pc's VFAT
partition (local Drive C)....such as the last line.  I have tried different
syntax, forward slashes, double slashes, backslashes, quotes, relative paths,
etc...but can't get pcpine to recognize the local folder collections.  What
is the correct syntax for that? 

Also, Is it possible to use the .addressbook stored on the imap host?  I 
have tried:

address-book             = {host1.somewhere.net}.addressbook

...and several variations on that theme, but have been unable to get it 
to use that addressbook.

Hey!

	I have tried to no avail to get pcpine to use PINERC and SIG files
from any directory other than the one containing the pine.exe file.  I have
set "use current directory" and put pine.exe in my MS-DOS PATH.  I have also
tried different "shortcut" configurations.  The only way I can get pcpine to
support multiple users' configurations has been to put a separate copy of
pine.exe in each user's directory (e.g.  c:\ppp16\pcpine\jasafir\pine.exe)
which is s tremendous waste of space.  I tried putting a lnk file called
pine.exe in the users' directories, but that still doesn't work.  I don't
think the VFAT file system has true unix-style symbolic links.  Is there any
known work-around for this?  Thanks...

Yes, only last night I used your account and I experienced the same problem.
I think the sys admin screw up.  So why don't you ask HIM?!
Or ask him about his password and we'll deletefix it for you.

    As for the behavior of 'forward', I think this is the way Pine was 
designed, i.e., you can type in some prefatory material ahead of your 
signature, with the actual forwarded matter following.  I prefer it this 
way.

I am afraid that access of a local folder is not possible. At my site and
at several sites we work with, we use the UUPC package of Kendra. This is
a UUCP implementation for the PC that includes a MUA (mail user agent AKA
MAIL.EXE). This works OK as we can read and write mail offline, but when
you once used PINE,... you want it for its user interface.

PC-PINE expects that your INBOX is on a mailserver with the IMAP daemon 
running, and the configuration should be: inbox-path={host.domain}inbox. 

For this reason it is not possible to use a local INBOX. I tried the same
as you described, tried to bake a new binary (difficult for someone who
knows his limitations are endless because of Unix whilest fighting MSDOS)
without succes. Even posted SEVERAL TIMES on this list,... but no one had
the guts to give me a response. Some told me about the same needs they
had, and asked for information if I found the clue, some names I remember: 

Charly Brady - Telstra
Shannon Adams
Jordan D. Luttrell

I even sent this request to "pine@cac.washington.edu" ... a robot answered
that I should not expect an answer ... pfffft ... promise kept !

If anyone on this list knows how to use PC-PINE with a local INBOX, so it 
can be used with an other transport than IMAP, please wooden shoe help !?

Thanks !

Hi
	I am the su on my local system. I recently set up Pine on my
machine (A DEC -station running ULTRIX 4.0). And I also have a
newsserver listed in the conf. file. 
	I can read all the newsgroups fine, but I am unable to post to
a newsgroup.  When I try to post, I get a message saying
	Error.. 480 Authentication required...
	What do I need to change or check so that I can post?
	Any info would be welcome.
	Thanks
			Take Care			Anil

You would not want 8bit everywhere.
After all, how would you display it on screen?
If all characters are allowed then how would you recognize an end-of-line?

And why is base64 better than uucode?  Please tell us!

All it needs is a better integration of codes into programs.
Make that "easier for persons without a clue".

I want to sort my mail file by date and then save the sorted file.
Normally you can sort a mail file by varuious criteria such as date,
but the changes do not get saved. I want these changes saved so I can
then have a file copy of my mail, sorted by date order.

Any ideas?

The most recent version of the IMAP toolkit, imap-4, supports the UIDL
command.  However, that probably won't help since (unless they fixed it
between beta 2 and beta 3) Netscape 2.0 always says that the server
doesn't support UIDL whether or not it does.

"faq" is no command, it is an electronic paper.  It does not talk, either.
If you are interested in a list of commands with their descriptions
then you should Read The Friendly Manual.  Try "man pine" once!

You can also mail c4123001@cc.ntu.edu.tw and ask for help about ELM.  HTH.

The "automated Bcc" feature is NOT a desired feature for mail programs
as it allows an intruder to add his own address for snooping.
Personally, I'd wipe such a mail program from my system.

I suggest you stick to the manual way, ie add your address to the Bcc line.
That way you might miss sending a mail to your other account, but you
definitely do not get a copy of the mails you do NOT want a copy of.  ;-)

I have several accounts, too, but I forward all mail to the "main" account
where I save and answer my mails.  It definitely is the easiest way to go.

Hi,

I'm new here, so if it's old stuff, please bear with me.

I received mail with an attachment of type:

  application/x-pgp-message

I tried 'pgp %s', but that just displays pgp asking for the passphrase.

Does anyone have a bash or csh shell script or perl script that allows 
for typing in the passphrase before displaying the output?

Thanks in advance, Mark

Be sure to check out this group, too:

Just insert "hometown", "street", "number" and "floor" as appropriate.

Hi!

I often have the need for putting mails in a certain folder. As you all 
know thats impossible. I could use the flag command but I dont have an 
american keyboard, to get the star * is only with shift possible...

Is there a simple (or even not simple way) to redefine the buttons for 
some commands?

Move the text file to your home directory (if it isn't already there), 
then use Pine's "R" (read) command to read the file into the Compose 
window.  The contewnts of the file will be inserted into your message at

The beep is a feature.  You cannot turn it off.
Maybe you should simply take your roommate's advice and
TURN THAT DAMN SPEAKER OFF!
And if you do too much email at night then GET A LIFE!

No, I don't think it'll help.  He's using a PC.

General idea:
If you don't have a shell to invoke the editor from then start composing a
mail so you'll get into the editor.  Almost every editor allows to switch to
another file for editing.  So simply switch to your signature file, edit,
and return to the previous file.  Do not mail the temporary file, though.  ;-)

Then again, if you don't have a shell then you might not even have a home
directory and thus no space for personal data, ie no signature file.
Btw, you don't need to have one to send mail.  It is NOT required.
You CAN live without a signature.  Trust me!

hi,
	When I mail to user a@b.com from root locally, the from line reads
root@b.com. But if I mail from other user, say x@b.com, the from line reads
x but not x@b.com.

	Anyone knows what's wrong? I really hope all the from lines can be
of the form user@FQDN.

	I'm using PINE3.91 in IRIX5.3 with sendmail running.

===
    In case it is not necessary for everyone in the alias to know the
    addresses
    of the other people then you can use the alias in the "Bcc:" line.
    Then everyone will still get a copy.
    Note:  The "To:" line still needs an address.  Use your own address.
    Example:
        To: (Me) myaddress
        Subject: Alias Test
        Bcc: alias

        This is just a test to see if you get a copy of this mail.

The current version of Pine (3.91) does not support authentication for 
Usenet News.  It may be coming in a future version (I always forget 
whether this may be 3.92 or "further down the road").

For the moment you will have to try to persuade your News Administrator 
to remove the need to authenticate before posting, or else switch to 
using a different program if you want to post news articles.

The sequence is a little unexpected and long-winded but does work:

1.  Open the folder you want to permanently re-sort.
2.  Sort it as you wish (using the "$" command).
3.  Select all messages and save them into a new folder[1]:
	; A A S newfoldername
4.  Go to the Folder List screen ("L")
5.  Rename the old folder under a different name ("R" command).
6.  Rename the new folder to have the original folder's name ("R" command 
    again).
7.  Open and check this folder.
8.  If happy, return to Folder List screen ("L") and delete the old 
    version of the folder.

Of course, once familiar with the method (and trust it!) you can, if you 
wish, change step 5 to "Delete the original folder" and omit step 8.

What logfiles?  ;-)

I assume you do not use Pine to log on to that host, do you?
You may not need this for some shell, but Pine may not use the same mechanism.

Why does it appear to you that way?
I think you are missing something.

Is there a way to send mail to a dummy address that doesn't go anywhere
but doesn't get returned?  The reason for this is to put a dummy
name such as To: distribution <nobody@nowhere>, and put the real recipients
in Bcc for big lists.  Addressing it to myself is the current scheme,
but then sometimes people think the mail is not for them.

Please email to zach@world.std.com.  Thanks.

Just put 'distribution:;' in To: field and recipients in Bcc:, e.g.

To: dummy-recipients:;

Subject: transporting pine folders
Date: Wed, 29 Nov 95 13:50:17 -100
Message-Id: <49hkuc$qg2@amcnix.amc.uva.nl>

The machine I currently use pine on, a vms vax, will be euthanized soon, so     
I have to move to a unix machine. I have ftp-ed all pine- and mail-related      
files (judging by the names) to the new machine. The default settings etc.      
have survived, but I cannot find any of my sent-mail and received-mail folders. 
The sysop says that the only way to transport these is to send all 500-odd      
messages one by one as email to the new machine :-( This seems a bit primitive  
for a program like pine.                                                        
Is this really the only solution, or is there someone out there who has a       
better idea? 

Thanks very much in advance.

This will pull the file out of your home directory, but you have to use 
^R when you are in the body of your message.

Hi, all!

As this list grows, I would rather put it as is (sorry if I duplicate 
anybody - I suppose there is Pine TO-DO list somewhere :-)

I list the features first and put the rationale after them for everybody 
interested.

1. Split user credentials and From: address. That is, add new parameter, 
e.g. mail-address, which is independent from user/host used for mailbox 
access.

2. Allow reply ONLY to recipients of the message (much as ELM group reply).

3. Poosibility to (re-)define the command keys - may be generalize to 
some sort of macros support.

4. Change TAB command (or add new) to be the 'next-new' across folders 
(instead of 'next-recent').

5. Real support of multiple incoming folders ( checking for new mail). 

6. When saving using Save command look up folder in address book (that 
is, check if this user has an alias and use corresponding Fcc entry) 
rather than just save under user name.

7. Sorting rule on per-folder (or at least per collection) basis

Rationale (for anybody ineterested :-)

1. The host where my incoming folders are is not actually related to my 
mail-address. I have always following problem: if I send mail user@host.name
is rewrtitten to proper mail address, but if I POST news, doesn't. So 
news come out with unrepliable address in From: header. I understand, 
that I can put Reply-To:, but I would prefer having proper From: address.

2. If I reply to message put on mailing list I would like to select
between reply to LIST and reply to SUBMITTER. Now I have the only
possibility to say 'reply to all', delete submitter, change Fcc: filed -
not very handy. 

3. It was asked by many people already - I would like to generalize it 
to macros support. Many tasks can be done without adding new 
feature/command, just by aggregating existing commands into the macro.

4. Current behavior of TAB command (next-recent) is well suited for
scenario when I run Pine, look through mail and quit. I normally start
Pine in separate window and it runs all day long - I suppose, some people
also do. In this case there is no way to quickly jump to the newly
arrived mail. If the checking of all incoming folders will be added (as I
hope), it would be espicially useful. 

5. It is obvious.

6. The reason is very simple - it seems logical to keep related mail 
together. If I SEND I get default Fcc as set in addressbook; if I 
RECEIVE I get default Fcc as user name. I would expect them be identical.

7. May be it is not so important, but sort order often depends on
contents.  News groups are naturally sorted 'threaded' and normal mail I
prefer to have sorted by Date: and also have some other folders with
another sortorder. Again, it always possible to hand-sort it, but Pine is
sooo user friendly normally ... :-)

Thanks to anybody who have got so far :--)

Are you using NCSA Telnet? If so, turn off the mapping of ^C, ^S and ^Q to
break, pause and resume, respectively. Helps with Emacs, too. =)

That seems to work great.  Thank you very much.  Do I have to use
distribution:; or just anything ending in :;?

We use pine 3.91 Unix, and sometimes we receive attachments

What's wrong with saving the mail to a file and transferring the file?

No.

Here's the sketch of a proof:

Assume it was posssible.
You start PINE with user id "uid1" on inbox "inbox1".
Now you switch to inbox2 which belongs to uid2. 
PINE now must be able to update "inbox2"
How should PINE get permissions of uid2?
Now, if PINE was able to change it's permissions simply by an entry
in the setup file then I'd define this:

	INCOMING xxx {root@your.host.domain}inbox

I'm sure I'd have lots of fun.  :-)

But we don't want any fun on the Internet, now, would we?
Internet means serious business.
That's why PINE probably doesn't have that feature.

QED.

Or, if you only want to delete all messages in the current folder, enable 
the aggregate command set and hit ";", then "a".  All messages in the 
current folder should be selected, so hit "a" then "d" and "x" and 
they're gone...

Message-Id: <951129190055_70423.2707_JHD156-2@CompuServe.COM>

Would you please forward me any information on PineMail?  We'd like to run in on
a SUN with Solaris 2.4 (2.5 soon) as soon as possible.

How do I get the binaries?  Do I need to compile myself?

Do you support this product at the U. of Wash.?  If so, how?  In terms of bug
fixes, updates, etc.

Is there a charge for any services you offer?

Could you send me the application on 4mm tape to below:

Thanks!

I have it turned on permanently, on one of my accounts.  In the
Setup/Configure panel, add a Customized-hdr of
     Bcc: foo@bar.baz
whatever you need.
 
I don't recall having to turn anything on in the feature-list
for this: I have enable-full-header-command turned on, but I don't
think that is necessary for your purpose.

Yes.  I puchased the other machine they sold last year.  And, no, I cannot get
it to compile either.  You havig the problem with c-client as well?  On mine
I'm trying pine3.91 and "build d-g" seems to work fine on pico and most of

The following was sent to me by eross@cccc.cc.colorado.edu:

add a line to c-client/os_d-g.c:

   #include "log_std.c"
   #include "gr_waitp.c"
   #include "tz_sv4.c"
+  #include <utime.h>

   #undef utime

This worked here this morning...

I've received an attachment encoded with UUEncode.

Is there any way I can view this with PINE?

If not, how can I decode it?

And, if MIME is the standard, why is anyone using UUEncode?  The message
was sent from s system using MCIMail, which apparently, uses UUEncode
automatically.

Thanks for whatever help anyone can offer.

Try putting the <utime.h> at the TOP of the file...before other includes.
Then I don't think you need the undef.  Then things should work...Replies 
et al, from what I recall.

There is no builtin uudecode in PINE. And there is no ONE standard.

Check with archie for a prog called uudeview, that is a nice useful decoder
not only for uuencoded files.

uuencode was (and perhaps still is) one of the standards on most systems. Most
postings in newsgroups are still uuencoded. 

Perhaps you have uudecode on your system? try to export the mail and run uudecode
on that file if you get uudecode: not found than get uudeview.

Ciao,
 Michael

There is no reason why you can not set your inbox-path to point to a local
folder on PC-Pine.  I just tried it, and it works fine.  PC-Pine will,
however, require that there be an active TCP stack.

What may be tripping you up is if your local file folders are not in one
of the formats supported by PC-Pine.  PC Pine supports mtx (its native
format) and tenex (same as on Unix, mtx with LF newlines) readwrite, and
Unix mbox files readonly.

So, for it to be reasonable to have your INBOX be on the PC filesystem,
you need a mail delivery agent that will write in MTX format.  It also
helps if the extension on the files is ".MTX" (but you can get rid of that
on the setup screen).

Subject: duplicate addresses appearing in .addressbook
Date: 29 Nov 1995 23:22:43 GMT
Message-Id: <49iq03$rvr@lace.colorado.edu>

One of our users is seeing duplicate entries of SOME (most)
but not all of his entries in .addressbook.  He is the only
user who has experienced this happening to his .addressbook
file.  He is also the only user who has configured pine so that
his .addressbook file is in a subdirectory of his home
directory, a directory he has called "mail".  Has anyone seen
this phenomenon before?  We are running pine 3.91 on a
DECstation 5000/240 with the Ultrix 4.3 operating system.
Any suggestions or pointers as to how this could happen are
welcome!   Thanks for any info.

could you please provide the format that should appear in my PINERC 
file?  As I indicated in my previous post, I have tried several different 
syntaxes in Setup/Config.  Thanks...

the files are in the format pine left them in on one of my unix

I am able to compose and send mail, read mail, forward mail, but NOT reply
to mail.  I get a core dump and Pine croaks at that point.  Forwarding
works fine, but not replying.

Anyone have any ideas?

A folder collection of the form
	C:\foo\bar\[]
will work fine.

You will have read-only, but not read-write, access to such folders when they
are local files on DOS.

Note that by default, only files with an extension of MBX will be recognized.

Assumed you are allowed to connect (1) and do know the root passwd (2).
Sure we will have lots of fun looking at the logfiles.

I can already log in to one host but I do need permissions and a password,
why can't this scheme be extended to multiple hosts. Maybe I'm missing some-
thing, but it appears to me your sketch is not valid.

Most everything we know about Pine can be found at

  http://www.washington.edu/pine

There are some precompiled binaries available via FTP (see below).
Solaris is one of them.

We support the 50,000 Pine users at the University of Washington.
We freely share the results of those efforts with the other 5 million Pine
users around the world.  Occasionaly folks on the Pine team take their own
free or family time to try to help others (but it never ceases to amaze us
how many people outside of UW *expect* us to support them.)

There are rumors of a new version coming along, but we don't try to guess
release dates anymore.

> Is there a charge for any services you offer?

In general our software is available for free,
and we don't currently sell any services.

> Could you send me the application on 4mm tape to below:

Sorry, no.  It's available via anonymous ftp from

  ftp.cac.washington.edu in the /pine directory

You're welcome... but you might want to know that your message went to a
world-wide mailing list of people interested in Pine.  To send just to
the UW Pine development team, use the address "pine@cac.washington.edu"

You'll get an immediate machine-generated acknowledgement that sez you may
never hear from us again (using wording ripped off from Netscape :),
but we do try to at least read everything that comes in...

You should realise that by Spamming newsgroups with useless crap that
no one could really give a shit about that your not going to help
yourself. People will more than likely avoid you. You obviously
haven't heard that usually when people spam newsgroups that they end
up with negative not positive effects. And how do you possibly claim
that sv.net.au is exclusive, I'd have thought that  world.net  is
slightly more exclusive. Next time post where its relevant and piss
off from other groups.

Where can I get a copy of Pine to run on an AlphaStation running OSF/1.

Is it free? Are there any ftp sites holding this?

Thanks in advance

I just need something to remind of people's birthdays.  I figured 
PINE gurus might know if such a thing existed because they're usually 
UNIX gurus as well.

Thanks,

The most obvious explanation is that you built the "sun" port of Pine
instead of the "sol" port.  The sun port is for the BSD-based SUN-OS; the
sol port is for Solaris (which is what "SunOS 5.4" really is).

On SUN-OS, mail was located in /usr/spool/mail, which is probably where
your Pine is looking.  If you make a symbolic link to /var/mail from
/usr/spool/mail, Pine will probably start working, but you should build
the proper port.

ie.

Also, is there an automatic way to reply and forward a copy of

Pine is available on the Internet via anonymous FTP:
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
Prebuilt binaries for various versions of Unix Pine are on:
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin/
Prebuilt binaries for various TCP/IP stacks on DOS are on:
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine/

We release updates periodically.  Pine 3.91 was released a year ago.  The
next release, Pine 3.92, will be a major update.

We accept bug reports at pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu, but we can't
guarantee that you'll get a fast response (or any response at all) due to
the huge volume of messages that we get.  Presumably, you'd rather have us
fixing bugs that spending our time answering the 500th message that
reports the same bug or every feature suggestion.  We do read every
message, though.

We don't charge.

We aren't in the business of shipping tapes; sorry.  Several vendors of
freeware CD-ROMs include Pine in their distribution.

    Not by Pine as such.

    It depends.  If you are running Pine on some Unix flavor and have 
enabled piping, just pull up the attachement and pipe to uudecode.  The 
output file should be in the current directory (I think).  Otherwise you 
may have to export/save to an external file and uudecode it manually 
with a utility.

    MIME is not really a standard as such' it's just what Pine uses.

Hi, folks!

Here is a question mostly for German users.

I am using Pine for Windows with WfW, German keyboard. Every time I 
press AltGr it changes my SPACE to 'move to next word' command. That is 
I JUST press AltGr, then tip in some words, THEN press SPACE - and jump 
to the next word. The only thing to make SPACE to work again is to give 
Ctrl-D - I didn't find any other remedy.

Have anybody seen it also? Is it a bug or a feature :-)

Thanks for any reply

greetings

I've got a strange configuration problem with PC Pine, or I've found
a bug in it's SMTP exchange.

Here are the symptoms:

PC Pine won't send mail although Windows Pine does.  The configurations
are identical as far as I can tell.

I see from the packets flying by that WinPine does a dns lookup and
connects to our mail-hub white.lambton.on.ca (aka lambton.on.ca)
with a HELO pcwhatever.lambton.on.ca and there is goodness and light.

Dumb ol' PC Pine just says HELO lambton.on.ca to which white exclaims:

HELO lambton.on.ca
553 Local configuration error, hostname not recognized as local

Is this a known bug in PC Pine or do I have something set up wrong?

SunOS 5.4 sun4m sparc

I have pine installed on /usr/local/bin/pine (protections:   -rwxr-xr-x)

When I enter pine it displays my INBOX as having zero messages. 

When I enter mailx it displays a queue of messages awaiting to be read.

What have I done wrong in this installation?

The mail is located in: /var/mail/userid

Although it had been working for awhile, Pine crashes under Windows NT 

WHEN I set it in the program manager to run in its own memory and 
AFTER I log into my mail server (name & password prompts work okay).  

Ocassionally, Pine survives until I try to open a folder, then it crashes.

Normally, I wouldn't mind NOT running it in 'mixed' memory, except that 
when Pine does crash there, it brings all of NT with it.


Specifically, I get:

PINE caused a general protection fault in module KNRL386.EXE at 0001:1A03.
Choose Close.  Pine Will Close.



Any ideas?



Thanks. 

   - Edward

So you use a Mac at home - but you do not use Pine on it.
Pine rather runs on the other end of the line, right?
(I here I was thinking that I have missed the release for the Mac version.)

Looks like the screen setup in your side does not match the stuff on the
other side.  You had better have a look at your terminal settings.

There is.  But you should not use anything you cannot communicate with.

Belief is what you should use when you go to church!

If you want to remove yourself from this mailing list, send the
following command in email to "Majordomo@cac.washington.edu":

    unsubscribe pine-info "K. Robert Carlston" <anthesis@getnet.com>

That should do the trick.

Yes indeed, Unix has a reminder service (really, what doesn't Unix have? ;-)
If you type the command

   man calendar

you should get some in-depth information regarding the use and configuration
of this calendar service. Feel free to contact me if you require extra help.

I've solved my problem. I had the pine-sun version installed on my system.
I instead have just installed the pine-solaris version and it is now
working.

Since I've run into the same problem only weeks ago, I can now send you
the information that other Net users were kind enough to send me (recycling
hits the Usenet ;-)

Your best shot for extracting the data on a Unix box is using either the program

   mcvert  ( see <http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive.html> for info )

or the program

   xbin    ( use archie to obtain one of the many ftp sites that carry it )

Subject: Building Pine On Solaris - Compile Time Options Don't Work
Date: Thu, 30 Nov 1995 11:53:26 GMT
Message-Id: <49k5us$j75@cocoa.brown.edu>

I build pine semi-succesfully on Solaris (2.3 I believe).

I specifically rebuilt it in order to modify certain compile-time
options such as allowing users to change the "From:" header, etc.  and
thus create a custom version of Pine, slightly different than the one
available on my system.

First of all, I was not able to find a pre-done option to build for
Solaris.  I followed the instructions to build the program on an
operating system which wasn't listed, and it ran when I finished.
Unfortunately, it functioned exactly as the version of Pine on my
system, seemingly ignoring all of the options which I had compiled it
with.

I was very careful that I was executing my local copy of pine rather
than the one available system-wide.  I am curious why such a seemingly
popular operating system isn't one of the default supported ones.
Perhaps the process which I went through to compile under this OS has
something to do with the compile-time options I set in the header not
taking effect?

Can anyone shed some light on this?  Thanks so much for your help.

Michael Weiss

Paul
This is incorrect.  MIME is *the* Internet standard for encoding and
labelling non-ascii messages.  See RFC-1521 (which, by the way, answers
Sven's question about what's wrong with uuencode.)

If anyone could help , i will be extremely grateful...
Is there a BCC function in pine? (Blind Carbon Copy?)
Meaning, is there any way that I can send to everyone on an addressbook 
distribution list without everyone on that list seeing who the mail was 
also sent to?
Please Email if you can help!

Damn... What rev are you running on what machine (DGUX-AViion)  

I will try to find time to figure out what change I made that allowed the 
smooth functionality.

I was wondering if PINE allows for a global search.  What I mean is that 
I want to search for a certain keyword, but in all my folders- not just 
the one I'm currently in.

Thanks,

I've been having a bear of a time getting 3.91 to compile on an AV5500
as well, and until I can get a version of Pine that lets me tell it how
to handle wierd mime types (like Content-Type: application/pgp; 
format=text; x-action=sign) I can't use the full features of ELM. *sigh*

Anyways, enough whining...

It sounds like where I'm having the problem is not unique - I try to reply
to a message, and it crashes.  I've tried adding extra debug messages to
the source, to isolate exactly where I get the failure, but so far it
seems to get to the end of end_tty_driver and vanishes.  This is *after*
it's gone through auger_in_signal from signal.c.

Here's a quick snippet:
*****
=== send called ===

  ---- COMPOSER ----
auger_in_signal()			<- Mine
about to end_tty_driver
post raw(0) call			<- Mine
Pine Panic: Received abort signal

save_debug_on_crash: Version 3.91: debug level 2

                   : Wed Nov 29 23:06:32 1995


Attempting to save debug file to /home/bm11455/.pine-crash
*****

Am I correct in thinking you've seen this before, or something similar
to it?

Good!  That's a "good feature"[tm]!

Those "string post" aka "cascades" are quite traffic friendly - NOT!
And they are only one of those reasons why the rule "more original than quote"
is used.  Let's keep it that way!

Should I mention that I edited your post and that I added more than I am
quoting from you?  Thank God for sigs!  hehehe

Hello,

  Pine used to beep when it received a new message.  Now it no longer 
beeps and in order to get new mail I have to exit Pine and run it again.  
I changed my .procmail, would this have broken it??  Thanks in advance!

Brian

I am writing a shell script to add entries to aliases

1. Will pine be okay with the .addressbook being written to?

2. Has this been done before, and do any scripts exist for

I am sure this has been raised before, so any help

have loaded pine v3.91 for linux...have been looking in the docs and in 
comp.mail.pine for some answers to no avail....so...couple of questions..

1. Is there a way to global disable the users ability to "A"dd newsgroups

This got it to ccompile on the DG/UX box.  BUT....
I cannot reply.  Everything else(well maybe not EVERYTHING)
seems to work right.  But, hit "r" to reply, then answer the
question about copying the message.  As soon as you type "y"
or "n" to the copying message question.  BOOM.  core dump.

How do these issues get addressed around here?

Edward Dunagin reshaped the electrons to say:

: 1. Is there a way to global disable the users ability to "A"dd newsgroups
:    after i customize their .newsrc file?

Seems sorta futile.  All they have to do is quit pine, grab a text
editor, and modify the .newsrc all they want....

An inadvertent

Subject: Tenex and scalability
Date: 1 Dec 1995 04:31:16 GMT
Message-Id: <49m0ek$q7l@bigblue.oit.unc.edu>

My system is the centralized campus email machine at this university, and
currently we have 27,000 users (increasing by about 2,000 per month).  We
maintain user mailboxes in a 5GB filesystem mounted over /var/spool/mail
on a centralized mailserver; all mail delivery is routed to this machine
via MX entries and sendmail LOCAL_RELAY directives.  This redirection of
mail, along with a hard mount, minimizes the mail locking problems which
are inherent in any large cluster sharing an NFS-mounted /var/spool/mail. 

Currently most mail (70%) is accessed on the client machines by an NFS
mount of the mailserver's /var/spool/mail filesystem over the client's
/var/spool/mail.  Pine (or in a very few cases Elm, mailx, etc.) access
the mail using the NFS filesystem.  Another large part of the mail (25%)
is accessed from PC IMAP (or POP) clients running all over the campus,
which connect to the University of Washington IMAP daemon (or the POP
gateway) running on the mail server.  The remaining portion (5%) use PC
IMAP or POP clients to connect to the IMAP or POP daemons running on the
login client machines. 

(The final 5%, though less than optimal, is because one of our campus's
favorite Mac clients doesn't deal with DNS naming conventions correctly,
and must use the client machines as their IMAP and SMTP hosts in order to
give mail the correct headers for proper reply.)

Obviously, as a system administrator I am interested in maximizing the
usefulness and performance of each of my machines.  If one uses
Berkeley-style ("Unix") mailboxes, then one's mail user agent (such as
Pine) or network mail access agent (such as the IMAP or POP server) must
load one's entire mailbox into memory in order to process it.  The Tenex
format, on the other hand, only requires the MUA or IMAP server to keep
one message into memory at a time.  This can result in significant
performance gains.  The Tenex mailbox style also allows for multiple
processes to concurrently access the file. 

I would therefore be very interested in using the Tenex mailbox style.  
But a few things about its requirements give me pause:

-- The most obvious one, the requirement of using a MUA or network
   mail access daemon that supports the Tenex format.  We are about to
   replace our current system (three high-end RS/6000's, one used for
   mailserving and the other two used for login and home directory
   fileserving) with a new, larger system (a ten-node SP, with one
   mailserver node, two fileserver nodes, and seven UNIX login nodes).
   I do not plan to install any MUAs other than Pine on the new
   system, so this requirement does not worry me.

   However, I am concerned that if at some point the Tenex format may
   no longer be the path we want to take, for whatever reason, there
   be a path of migration.  Are there programs to convert from Tenex
   to Berkeley format?  Is the Tenex specification available so that
   we can write our own utilities to convert its format to some other
   in the future?  Where would I find a paper documenting this mailbox
   style?

-- I am told that the Tenex format uses Unix filesystem semantics not 
   available under NFS.  Is this true?  If so, can I expect my mailserver to 
   be able to handle enough more IMAP clients with Tenex so that I can 
   convert my whole cluster to use IMAP exclusively?

   As I said before, we currently use NFS to mount a shared
   /var/spool/mail stored on the mailserver.  This seems to distribute
   CPU usage fairly well, because mail deliveries and most IMAP access
   is local, while MUAs on the Unix login clients use NFS.  At one
   point I changed my global pine.conf file on one of the login
   clients to use IMAP by default.  The mailserver was overwhelmed.
   It seems that the 50-60 imapd processes it runs now are about all
   it can manage in the Berkeley format.  Is it likely that switching
   to Tenex would allow the mailserver to run the 400-700 imapds
   needed with similar performance?

-- If not, what are other possibilities?  Transparency and elegance
   are very important to our user community, and the
   "username@username.email.unc.edu" DNS trick suggested previously on
   this newsgroup simply would not be accepted here.  *Everyone* has
   an address of the form "username@email.unc.edu" and *everyone*
   connects to "mailserv.unc.edu".  The fact that our user
   documentation does not have the copious conditionals ("if you are a
   student whose name begins with A-F and you will graduate in 1997,
   use the following hostname") that are so common at other
   universities has been a blessing for support people.

-- I am interested to know whether the Tenex mailbox style will work
   in AFS.  If so, could I continue to NFS-mount /var/spool/mail, and
   modify the c-client to *always* move mail into the home directory,
   whether or not a mail.txt file is present?

-- If, after the above questions are answered, we decide to move to
   Tenex, we will want to move the current mailboxes to that format so
   that users don't notice the change (again, transparency and
   elegance). Is there a tool out there to convert Berkeley mailboxes
   to Tenex in place?  If not, would it be easy to write one?

As our IMAP client usage goes up, the 50-60 concurrent imapds my
mailserver currently supports will become more and more insufficient.
IMSP's IMAP server redirection, if and when it becomes available and
is fully supported by Pine and other major IMAP clients, would solve
our problems in one fell swoop, but it looks like it may come too
late.

I am interested in discussing these issues with attendees of the IMAP
meeting at UW in January, but the design decisions for this new
complex of machines must be made before then.  I'd appreciate any
thoughts anyone has on the above.
