Well, if it's deleted then it is really really GONE.
"Deleted" means "deleted".  Geddit?

However, if it is only "marked for deletion" in your folder
then you do get a chance to remove that mark. (Dunno the command.)
There also may be a spurious copy of it somewhere on your system
but you can never rely on such things.  Ask your sysadmin about this.

I tried that without the undef, and the program locked up when I tried to
run it.  Froze immediately when I logged into it.

I put the utime include at the top, but left the undef at the bottom, and
I still get the unable to reply problem...Pine crashes.

This got it to ccompile on the DG/UX box.  BUT....
I cannot reply.  Everything else(well maybe not EVERYTHING)
seems to work right.  But, hit "r" to reply, then answer the
question about copying the message.  As soon as you type "y"
or "n" to the copying message question.  BOOM.  core dump.

How do these issues get addressed around here?

Solaris is supported, but we do not use Solaris at our site so we only do
minimal testing.  There are a number of reasons which I would prefer not
to go into.  Let's just say that SUN has not exactly bent over backwards
to encourage us to buy their systems or to develop for their systems.

Most likely.  It isn't possible to determine from your message what you
did.

You can use pine with a pop mail server by using a program like popclient
(ftp.mal.com) to retrieve your mail from the pop server into your spool file,
then runing pine.

I'm technical support for the "Universidad de Belgrano" in Argentina.
We are using PINE 3.91 on HP-UX and Linux machines.
We have configured sendmail in order to "hide" the host name from
the sended mail.
However, the host name still appears on the "Message-ID" header line.
As far as I can see this header is generated by pine and leaved untouched
by sendmail.

I appreciate very much if somebody knows if it's possible configure pine
in order to not show the host name in this header line or another 
suggestions to really hide the host name.

Any comments will be useful.

Many thanks in advance.

Hi, folks!

I dare post some more wishes to future Pine.

There are now-a-days listservers which use multipart/digest format. I 
find Pine handling of such digests GREAT - I get overview of contents, 
can easily jump to any part. But some drawbacks:

1. In attachment index list I have e.g.
   20   shown    132 lines  text  , "Here goes title (or subject) ..."
It is not to scale, but it leaves slightly more then 40 characters to 
Subject, and it is not so much. 

So feature - add possibility to scroll the index line left and right or 
disable other parts of line (they are not actually so entertaining).

2. Add Full-header mode when in viewing attachment (I have seen such 
wish already).

3. When viewing message/rfc822 part (and ALL digest parts are message) 
be able to Reply to original sender. Now I can reply only to the 
submitter of digest as whole. I have checked such digests - normally 
EVERY part has original sender as From: header.

But as said, Pine is REALLY great in handling this sort of mail.

Much thanks to Pine authors for such a good work!

greetings

I have just built PINE 3.91 on two of our campus systems that were running
PINE3.89. They are in test mode right now but will be put into production for
our >5000 ids in approximately two weeks.  

The first system:  SUN Sparc 10 with OS  SunOs 4.1.3_U1  
I did a 'build clean' and then 'build sol'  and it built with only a few 
warning messages.

The second system: SUN Sparc 1000 with OS  Sun 5.4 (Solaris 2.5)
I had a few problems with this one. BUT thanks to Ed Greshko 
<Edward.M.Greshko@cdc.com> for sharing his info, I found the following three 
steps he mentioned were DEFINITELY required:
1. Make sure that /usr/opt/SUNWspro/bin appears in your path *before* 
/usr/ucb
2. Edit the makefile.sol file in the pine directory and add  -Dconst=  to 
the CFLAGS line
3. Make sure you *unset* the environment variable  LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

I then did a 'build clean' then a 'build sol' and it built . TA DA! :-)

Hope this info helps.

Subject: Bug (ID Y777J): remote access freezing

While composing a message on remote access from Georgetown Univ, very 
regularly the left arrow key will malfunction, giving beep and this sign 
[D]. This is also a signal to me that I will be unable to send or do 
anything with the current screen other that ^G, help. The phrase 
"unknown command also appears at bottom of screen (with beep). I just 
have to disconnect the modem. 
Often correlated with this is a real garbling of the text, sometimes going to 
the email address originally intended, once I manage to retreive the 
interupted message from another site (i.e. at the Univ).I 
have spoke with the local tech. staff who cannot tell me anything. 

I am sure it is not any mechanica problem with my keyboard, I operate on 
a brand new notebook with a PMCIA 14400 modem. It sends faxes and 
connects in with the unix just fine. Reading email is no problem either.

Do you have any ideas?

Curious.  We've been running it since April with no problems whatsoever,
under 5.4R3.10MU02.  I've even recompiled it recently, to integrate ispell
into Pico, and we've never had the least glitch.  The patch that Eric details
below is the only change I made, other than some options in 
pine/osdep/os-sv4.h.

The only difference between our site and others may be the fact that we 
use Smail rather than sendmail.

Hello,

One of the users (actualy my boss), asked how to print an index of a 
folder. He cannot use print-screen because he is connected with a 
hard-terminal to our systems.

Any idea?

THANKS in advance (Maybe I will be promoted)

By the way, to do this press command-s (hold down the key with the 
propeller and press S).  Then delete the entries in each of the three 
fields in the dialog box displayed.

I'm building a BBS called INLIGHT BBS for metaphysical products, books, 
tapes, discussion areas and some network marketing opportunities.  
INLIGHT BBS, P. O. Box 806, Dillsboro, NC 28725 USA [ANSI; 8-N-1],
(704) 586-6831.  Appreciate if you'd pass the word about my BBS.  
I'm also looking for an inexpensive way to connect my BBS to Internet.
I'm just a beginner and struggling along to understand how all this 
works.  Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Al Bouchard, SysOp

I'd use an alias to myself for the To: line.
Example:

	To: FOO Mail List readers <guckes>
	Subject: [FOO] BAR blah blah

	Hello, gentle readers of the FOO Mailing List!
	This is a test.  Please ignore!

	me (FOO Mail List Maintainer)


It's not perfect, but at least I know that I can filter all those mails into
a mailing list folder.

This might be a "stupid" answer but, why not send it to yourself!  It 
will, of course, go somewhere - directly to your own mailbox to do with 
as you please.

Hope this isn't a "saucy" answer but one that might be of use to you!

Trey, I can answer some of your comments.

One of the programs in the imap-utils package, mbxcvt, can convert between
any of the mailbox formats supported by c-client.  imap-utils is on the
ftp.cac.washington.edu server.

It is possible that we will migrate to a new format I am developing called
mbx format (I'm alpha-testing it now, but it's not ready for prime time),
however tenex format will never be desupported in our toolkit.

The Pine technical notes describe tenex format.

> -- I am told that the Tenex format uses Unix filesystem semantics not
>    available under NFS.  Is this true?

Yes.  It expects that file operations which are documented to be atomic
are atomic; that when file data is updated there are no obsolete copies of
the file data in some cache; and that a working facility to apply shared
and exclusive locks (and switch between shared and exclusive) exists.
None of these are true on NFS.

NFS is great as a easy way to do FTP or rcp, but it is not a true
filesystem.

This, you will have to judge for yourself.  Our experience with RS/6000
hardware and IMAP servers suggests the following:
	1) More smaller disks are better than fewer large ones.  Better
	   to have eight 1GB spindles than a single 8GB spindle.
	2) Try to have sendmail not use the same spindle as imapd.
	   Sendmail uses a lot of disk bandwidth and you don't want it
	   fighting with your imapds.  The same thing holds for syslog
	   and other daemons.
	3) File fragmentation tends to be a problem on AIX.  Since tenex
	   files are accessed with random access I/O, they are almost
	   never rewritten (and hence defragmented).  You may need to
	   write a defragmentation tool (shudder!) to defragment mail
	   files every so often.
	4) Don't swap on the same disk that does mail files either.

It all depends upon how much memory is available.  The computer center
splits its user community (the entire campus) across a dozen RS/6000
servers.  They don't want to run out.

imapd does not need much CPU.  It's all a matter of memory and disk
bandwidth.

Subject: pine problems


Hi, I have downloaded pine and it runs, but there are 2 major problems:

1. It won't recognize incoming mail, so it thinks I have no mail
even when I do.

2. Whenever I send mail, although it does send mail successfully, it always
beeps some error about failing to create sent-mail.lock.

Any suggestions?

Henry

It may take a long time (usually 300 sec). Try ^L (Control-L) or move your cursor
past the last line in the (I)ndex, then PINE will check for new emails.

Look where this file is created (I think it's your maildirectory, look in the (C)onfig-
Screen for folder-collections) and check if you have write-permissions for this directory.
Looks like you don't have it (or don't have the directory at all!

Set write-permissions or create the directory, that should do it.

Message-Id: <j3enuolqaa.fsf@cass45.ast.cam.ac.uk>

Hi.

I have some troubles with Pine. Whenever I have messages in my INBOX
I'm am not able to delete them. If I mark them as deleted and either
try to quit or try to eXpunge them, pine hangs and must be killed
(sometimes hangup suffices). I can, however, delete mail from other
folders without any problem, it's just the INBOX that makes a
problem. Pine always hangs if I try to quit and there is any mail in
the INBOX actually, deleted or not.

The only information I can get from the debugging files that seems to
be slightly odd is the following:


IMAP 15:49 12/1 mm_log babble: Find of mailbox outside context:
/home/jarle/.pine-interrupted-mail 
- mailcap_free -

There is no such file as .pine-interrupted-mail... 

Does anyone know what may be the cause of this? The system is SunOS
5.4, the Pine version is 3.91.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

					Jarle.

Date: 1 Dec 1995 14:52:19 -0500
Message-Id: <49nmdj$n8s@panix.com>



I am zz@panix.com .  Panix is an Internet Service Provider.
I have a higher level domain:  munn.nyc.ny.us .
On that domain (serviced for me by Panix), I am
a@munn.nyc.ny.us .

I use Pine.  I want my header to show my own higher level
domain, not panix.com .  So, I went to the Pine menu, chose 
setup, chose configure, and then changed the user-domain line
to a@munn.nyc.ny.us .  The result is that my header's from line
became
	"Alan J. Munn" <zz@a> .
I can't get rid of the zz as user ID.  What I typed in (on the
user-domain line of the configure menu) _before_ the @, gets put
_after_ the @ on the from line of my header.

Thus, a@munn.nyc.ny.us becomes zz@a .

What I prefer on my from line is
	"Alan J. Munn" <a@munn.nyc.ny.us .
I will settle for
	"Alan J. Munn"

Please tell me what to do.

Alan,
Set user-domain to just the domain, not your whole address.
That is, lose the "a@".

    If you changed your procmail recipes file such that ALL incoming 
mail now goes into some folder or other rather than remaining in the 
INBOX in the spool, then Pine would beep _only_ when a piece of mail 
was received _only_ when you had that particular folder open (i.e., 
the folder that mail was being stuffed into by procmail).  What you 
are describing is not necessarily "broken" behavior but may just be 
the way Pine works in conjunction with filters such as procmail.

I had inquired about MIME to PINE-ROBOT@DOCSERVER.CAC.WASHINGTON.EDU they 

replied giving your address to ask about the Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) to 

solve my queries to decode the mails coming to me from my friends on Internet as I am

on X.400 E-mail named XEE-mail which does not allow me to read the mails as they are 

not readable.

Please send me the FAQ so that i can update my info. about MIME and PINE 

I would also like to know about pine.pine.tar.^z which i hope is the utility to decode the 

messages coming in MIME encoded form.

I hope to get the required info.

I had the same problem. Tried to send a "bug report", but it seems there no
hope to get any answer, other than the automatic one:

I quess this was little too easy, I found the answer myself. In .pinerc there
is a place for customized headers.

contact the server and see but I don't want to be running pine all the time to

This would seem to be a mistake.  Among other things, it would look for mail
in /var/mail/username instead of /var/spool/mail/username.  I have not built
pine for SunOS for over a year, but there is an option for regular SunOS.

 >The second system: SUN Sparc 1000 with OS  Sun 5.4 (Solaris 2.5)

This is also a mistake.  SunOS 5.x maps to Solaris 2.x on a one-to-one basis
for x, such that SunOS 5.4 equals the OS component of Solaris 2.4 (and the
windowing system is OpenWindows 3.4).

 >/usr/ucb

/usr/ucb should always be last in the path on Solaris.  The main thing that
people put it in the path early for is to get a bsd style df, but standard
/usr/bin/df has two switches '-tk' that cause it to do the right thing.

 >2. Edit the makefile.sol file in the pine directory and add  -Dconst=  to

I really do not understand why this was not part of the distribution.  Let's
hope they get it right next time.

 >3. Make sure you *unset* the environment variable  LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

Ideally LD_LIBRARY_PATH should never be set.  All binaries should be linked
with the -R flag set (and the same value as -L) so they can find their
dynamic libs.

A piece of general advice to people who are compiling stuff on Solaris, you
should get the Solaris Porting FAQ at the FAQ place, and hang out on
c.u.solaris.  In general Sun and AT&T did not do a good job with the src
compat stuff when they developed SVR4, plus a lot of interfaces changed.
Now that everyone has gotten most everything ported to the new SVR4
interfaces, Sun is adding some new bsd src compat stuff in Solaris 2.5,
which will break backward compatibility from 2.5 back to 2.4 or 2.3 (no one
should still be running Solaris < 2.3 anymore if they can possibly help it),
so, even though 2.5 will support more of the bsd stuff, people should still
avoid it unless they can guarantee no one will ever try to run the binaries
on Solaris < 2.5.

Get the Solaris Porting FAQ and do a proper SVR4 port of anything that is
not already done.

I'd like to second this ... apparently cc:Mail does some strange things
with MIME - when I tried replying to a message I got generated by cc:Mail
that was MIME'd, the "Include message text?" text was nothing but the
headers - the real message was sent as an attachment.

Secondly, does anyone know if there's a plan for PINE to support POP3
rather than [in addition to] IMAP (3-beta, 4-alpha, etc.) ??

I've cobbled together a little script that I use to sign stuff.  Basically, you
enable an alternate editor, and then set the alternate editor to be the script.

The script fires up pico (or your favorite editor; I use pico since that's the
pine editor ;-) and you compose the letter.  Then, when you exit, it asks if
you want to sign it and if you want to digitally sign it.  If so, it adds your
.sig and your pgp signature.

It's fairly short, so I won't bother uuencoding it.

sign:
<SNIP HERE>
#!/bin/sh
#Edit the following to suit your needs.
PATH_TO_SIG=$HOME/.mail.signature
PINE_EDIT='pico -z -t'
#Everything else is pretty much fixed.  Only muck around with it if you
#know what you're doing.
$PINE_EDIT $1
clear
echo "Add your signature to this? [Y/n] " 
read SIG
echo " "
echo "Digitally sign this? [Y/n] "
read PGP

if [ "$PGP" = "y" ]
	then 
		pgp -sat $1
		mv $1.asc $1
fi

if [ "$PGP" = "Y" ]
	then 
		pgp -sat $1
		mv $1.asc $1
fi

if [ "$PGP" = "" ]
	then 
		pgp -sat $1
		mv $1.asc $1
fi

if [ "$SIG" = "y" ]

		cat $PATH_TO_SIG >> $1
fi

if [ "$SIG" = "Y" ]

		cat $PATH_TO_SIG >> $1
fi

if [ "$SIG" = "" ]

Hope this helps.

pine and pgp... How do you get pgp hooked up to pine? I have this script 
that intercepts the editor before (elm) receives control. 
I'm sure something like that can be done for pine right? Thanks...

My internet service provider gives each subscriber a UNIX shell 
account...  That shell account has access to PINE as the mail program... 
 I find this a very good way to handle e-mail since I can logon from 
various computers and all my mail is in one place rather than scattered 
all over the place...

Every now and then I get disconnected in the middle of composing an 
e-mail...  After getting successfully re-connected to and upon starting 
up PINE and choosing compose the message I was working on comes back 
just like I had used the ^O (postpone) option...  I do not know what to 
do to assure that this event will take place...

Sometimes it seems that the e-mail I was working on goes into the 
"bit-bucket"...

I wonder if any "pine-grurus" (or perhaps UNIX grurus) out there know 
what to do to reattach to a session that was terminated by a 
disconnect...  Murphy's Law states that this event will only occur while 
composing the longest messages...

Thanks in advance...

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I've been running PINE on my Linux machine for a couple of months without
problems.  I'm using a PPP connection to the machine which stores my
mail.  Until yesterday, PINE would start up, say "Opening INBOX...", pause
for 5 seconds or so, then request login and password.  Everything was
hunky-dory, although I did wonder why there was the delay.

Yesterday my Internet service provider noticed weird rsh requests - apparently
PINE was attempting to start up an IMAP server on the remote host.  Security
was beefed up and now PINE will just hang when it gets to the "Opening
INBOX..." message - apparently it tries the rsh request, doesn't handle
the failure properly, and never attempts to contact the IMAP
port on the remote host.

Has anyone heard of such a problem?  Does PINE in fact attempt an rsh?
Why?  How can I comment this out of the source?  Any other pointers?
Is this something magic/wrong with the Linux port of PINE?

Help!

Thanks in advance...
(replies through email *will* work because I can just log into the mail
server)

If it's an incoming folder, i.e., receives messages via something 
like procmail, then you should not delete it this
way in case it is receiving a msg at the moment that you delete it.
You should use a method that uses file locking, e.g., what Jesse
describes below.

Date: 2 Dec 1995 07:00:51 GMT
Message-Id: <49otj3$kss@bcfreenet.seflin.lib.fl.us>

A two part question:

- Is there any way I can get PCPine to work on a non-networked DOS box?  
  I've got numerous folders downloaded from my system (which has an 
  *extremely* small quota) that I would like to be able to manipulate in a 
  less-clumsy fashion than my current system (text editors and word 
  processors).  It's a real hassle to have to go through all these huge 
  tfiles when I can use Pine to manipulate them very easily.

- Where is PCPine located?

Thanks for any help anyone can give.

Why don't you create an alias and then send the mail to that alias? 
Or have your admin create it and point it at a file you own?

Or, as a hoot, don't put a To: header in at all. Use only a BCC:, which
can be blank.

What you might be unaware of is that BCC was't intended to keep the
recipients completely secret. It is permitted for the BCC list of
addresses to be included in the mail sent to anyone in the BCC list.
Just not to anyone in the To: or CC: header.

    Pine first makes a connection to your mailbox host, then attempts to
exec the imapd on that host with an rsh process.  If this fails, such as
if you don't have a .rhosts file to permit access from your Linux box,
Pine then reverts to the login/password authentication.
    This delay is due to the time taken for this rsh attempt at transparent
passwordless login to fail and an IMAP port 143 connection to be
established.
    To prevent Pine from trying this rsh login (whose intent is to make
the IMAP access to the mail folders transparent to the users), specify
the IMAP port number in the host specification separated from the
hostname by a colon, like...
{mailhost.your.domain:143}INBOX  [also for folder connections*]

    Your delay should be shorter.  There may still be a slight delay as
Pine establishes the port 143 connection, but Pine will then skip the
attempt at rsh.

    What your ISP has probably done is to install the tcp_wrapper package
and configure it to refuse rsh attempts.  However, there's a problem with
the way this package closes the refused connection and what an attempt at
an rsh without .rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv fails.  I forget the details,
maybe someone else can provide them, and possibly configuration to the
tcp_wrapper package so this is not a problem.

    In short, if you try an rsh process that fails (darn it, the security
measures I had set up seem to be no longer in effect so I can't describe
how it would look) with something other than a Login incorrect or
similar, then use the :143 to bypass this authentication.

* I believe there is some minor bug related to a hack I made to the folder
collections.  This would only affect you if you do not already have an
IMAP connection to your host, for your primary INBOX, for example.  I know
my hack to specify username in the .pinerc** wouldn't work there; I'm not
sure if the port specification is ignored as well.

** Don't ask.  My hacks were wiped out from all the accounts where I had
them saved, sorry.

Jill,
Look at the following entry in your .pinerc file and make sure it reads 
as follows:

# Your printer selection
printer=attached-to-ansi


Then when you hit the Y key, the printing should occur on your local 
printer (or to whatever printer you may have re-directed your local 
printing to.  

Let me know if you have further problems.

Is the host running imapd?  If so, you can use IMAP to access
your messages.

Borek,

> Can this be automated?

You should be able to set your userid in pc-pine's Setup/Config:

# Your login/e-mail user name
user-id=jasafir

Otherwise, unix pine should offer to use the same username on the remote 
imap server as on your current login.  As far as automating the process, 
to my knowledge your only option would be to use "initial-keystroke-list" 
in Setup/Config and get the sequencing right.  Also, make sure that if 
you put your password in there, you at least "chmod o-r ~/.pinerc".  I'd 
like to see increased imap login functionality in future versions of 
pine, but I don't know what changes, if any are planned...  Viel Gluck!

In a previous article, mjw@pobox.com (Michael J. Weiss) says:

>saved-msg-name-rule    =
>What is the difference between the "by-sender" and "by-from" options?

    Certain LISTSERV mail exploders send out their mails with the ``From:''
header as the person who sent the message to the list, and the ``Sender:''
field containing the name of the list.

    Chances are, if you don't pre-sort your mail through some filter
program, you'll want to save all mail arriving in your INBOX from a
mailing list to a folder of the same (or similar) name, rather than to
a folder with the name of the person who sent the message to the list.

    By selecting the by-sender option, such LISTSERV mail will be put
into a LIST-L style folder name.  With the by-from option, a separate
folder will be used for each list participant.

    If memory serves, the by-sender rule actually was the by-from
behavior through Pine3.85 .

Hello,

  When other people using pine mail an original message to me, I am 
automatically included as a CC.  It asks if I wish to "Reply to all 
recipients?"  Why is this??

Thanks,

I'm trying to run PcPine (WATTCP version) on a stand alone PC through 
Etherppp via modem to the Compuserve gateway.  It seems to connect OK, 
but keeps asking me for an INBOX.  I have tried to define INBOX in 
Pinerc as a local file on my hard drive, but it doesn't seem to take.  
It seems I connect OK to Compuserve, but when I try to download 
Usenet newsgroups, PINE hangs.  Is this related to the INBOX problem?  
Anyone have a patch that allows PCPine to use a local INBOX?

Please respond only by email, since my access to Usenet is irregular.  
TIA.

I have just discovered, to my considerable cost and embarrassment,
that pine hasn't the simplest idea of privacy.
(I'm using 3.91 compiled for Solaris.)

I post to a newsgroup. (1)
Someone emails me concerning that post, doing a reply to me. (2)
I email a reply to them. (3)

Since they emailed me, it's now a private conversation unless
both parties agree to make it public.

So, when I send the email reply in pine, pine pops up a helpful
question. 'Do you want to post this to the newsgroups X too?'

And I say yes, because I assume that for pine to ask me, the
email I am replying to must have been both mailed and posted.

This is not the case. pine asks this seemingly helpful question anyway,
regardless of whether or not (2) was mailed or mailed-and-posted.

THIS IS THE STUPIDEST TRAP I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF FALLING INTO.

Posting private email is bad form on usenet, yet pine encourages you
to do it. I am severely peeved. I can't believe that a program as
mature as pine is can have this goddam awful behaviour.

So how do I hack the source to change this awful and dangerous behaviour?

In a probably futile endeavor to foreshorten yet another protracted and
pointless flame-fest on this topic, here are a few facts:

 o The root of the problem is that *some* news-reading programs put a
   Newsgroups header into *email* messages that they send via SMTP,
   which were *not* also posted via NNTP.

 o In order to accommodate the behavior of these newsreaders (which we
   feel is at *best* ill-advised), Pine 3.92 will ignore Newsgroups
   headers when deciding whether to give you the CHOICE of posting, unless
   there is also a PATH header.

 o In the meantime, you can tell procmail to delete such newsgroup headers
   in incoming email messages.

    That won't quite work in this case.  Pine's user-domain setting allows you
to change the domain, but not the login.  In order to change the login,
as this user needs to do, it would be necessary to be running a version
of Pine custom-compiled to allow changing of the From: header.

    If such a version is being run, then the  From: <zz@panix.com>  can be
rewritten to be  From: "Alan J. Munn" <a@munn.nyc.ny.us>
This is necessary if the desired login is different.

    For the most part, it would be adequate to add an optional custom
Reply-To: header field with the a@munn... address, since the majority of
e-mail programs will direct mail to that address, but there are some cases
where using the From: field is desirable.

Pine supports POP3 now, but it's buggy (the bugs are fixed in Pine 3.92).
Not that anyone would *want* to use POP3 if they have IMAP available.

Pine tries the command "rsh IMAPSERVER /etc/rimapd" to see if it can get a
IMAP connection using rsh authentication.  If you do not have rsh
permission, or if /etc/rimapd does not exist, then the rsh command gets an
error and it will open a TCP connection to port 143 (the IMAP port) which
will require you to log in.  Normally, the rsh rejection happens in a few
seconds.

Your ISP made the usual knee-jerk response, which was to turn off rsh
service in a paranoid assumption that "security was being violated".  No
such thing was actually happening, and generally sites which behave this
way are clueless about real security problems which go on.

The problem with the knee-jerk response is that they usually do it wrong;
they simply remove rsh service or filter out rsh packets.  The problem is
that without an explicit refusal from an rsh server, the rsh client will
take a substantial amount of time before it times out.  Pine is sitting
there waiting for the rsh program to do something.

Pine 3.92 will impose a 10 second alarm clock around the rsh call.  The
right fix it to get your ISP to turn off rsh properly, or find another
ISP.

The workaround that you can do now is to force Pine to connect to port
143, skipping the rsh step.  You do that by appending ":143" to the
hostname in the mailbox specification.  For example, in .pinerc:
	inbox-path={imapserver.paranoid-isp.com:143}inbox

Another workaround, if you assume that you will never be able to use rsh,
would be to remove the rsh binary from your system and/or rename it so
that Pine cannot find it.

That behaviour is most certainly not ill-advised. (The newsreader in
question was rn, by which all other newsreaders are judged and many
are found lacking.)

If the reply is in response to a thread that has been crossposted to
more than one group, the Newsgroups: line could provide useful information
saying which group was being read for the response to be made, which
can influence how you in turn respond.

If newsreaders used the Newsgroups: line to indicate which group was
being read at the time, rather than just copying the line from the posted
article being replied to, we'd see a lot less spamming in newsgroups,
and a lot more newsgroup-relevant discussion as followups settled into
the most relevant group.

A very sensible decision.

 it seems that the "D" command, when viewing folder, does the job in a way

The newsgroups header is the RFC-defined way to specify which newsgroups a
message should be posted to.

The concept of which newsgroups a message thread originated in is an
entirely different one, and using the same header for both is "at best,
ill-advised", rn apologists notwithstanding.

Like I said, I don't want to see another extended and pointless argument
about this, so I'll stop now, and we can agree to disagree.  Since Pine
3.92 will include a work-around for the rn behavior, the issue is moot.

"Do you want to blow away your inode table too? (Y/N)"

Sure, it's the user's fault.  But it's Pine's fault too.  I've seen
enough people bitten by this feature that I have to consider it a
design bug.  You don't have to be totally clueless to make the
mistaken assumption that the program knows what it's doing.

I don't understand why Pine feels the need to ask this question.  A
Newsgroups: header is no indication that the message was mailed-and-
posted -- unfortunately, there is no standard way to indicate this,
AFAIK.  And unintended privacy is a much better failure mode than
unintended publicity.  If you're a Pine user, how often do you answer
"yes" to this question, or have you turned it off?

Not having used Pine, I may be off base: if this feature is off by
default and gives a warning on activation, the user has only himself
to blame.

  As a frequent user of pine I have gotten used to thinking before 
answering yes, and I usually say no if I am not sure, so that privacy is 
protected.  Regardless what you do some people will complain as the 
computer should be psychic, and it is not.  My second rule of programming 
is: Computers are stupid (Rule 1 is KISS).
  Just my $0.02, but when asked a question think and don't assume.  Take 
care and have fun.

I also don't want to get into another discussion about this.  If you
are interested in helping to come up with a set of message headers that 
will be meaningful to both mail and news user agents, please read
comp.mail.headers and consider joining the mailnews-l mailing list.
Information about that list is at:

   http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/mailnews.html

Thanks,
Nancy

Here's a procmail recipe that should work to do this:

:0 fhw
* ^Newsgroups:
* ! ^Message-Id:.*Pine
| formail -R Newsgroups: X-Originated-In-Newsgroups:


I have lots of info about setting up and using procmail at:

I think it's important to distinguish access protocols and access
paradigms... I believe that when most people ask for POP support, they
have in mind "offline" access, wherein mail is downloaded from the server
and deleted.  Pine does not yet support offline message processing, but
that is a planned enhancement.

As Mark states, if you want to access a mail server in *online* mode, but
using POP rather than IMAP, you can do that today (by recompiling Pine
with a recent c-client version to fix some bugs).  Presumbaly this
scenario is only of interest where a provider refuses to run an IMAP
daemon.

For more info on this topic, see

I am trying to delete all the messages (more than 1,000) in a folder at a 
time.  I typed ";" for select, "a" for all, and "d" for delete.  But, 
instead of all messages, just one where the cursor is located is 
deleted.  What's wrong?  I cannot find any Config about this.

You are missing one "a" for the "apply" command, so you need:   ;aad

(In the absence of Apply, commands affect just the current msg.)

I'm no expert, but I've done some experimenting and am also interested
in any better suggestions, here is what I've learned.

>1. Will pine be okay with the .addressbook being written to?

Yes.

>2. Has this been done before, and do any scripts exist for
>   this sort of thing?

Simple aliases are stored one to a line in the format

nickname<TAB>Name, Full<TAB>address

where <TAB> denotes a control-I, it should not be hard to write a
script to add such lines.  What I am more interested in is maintaining
distribution lists in a one-address-per-line format.  I find I can do
so if I edit the addressbook outside of Pine and construct each list
like so:

listname<TAB>Name of List<TAB>(nobody,
   address1,
   address2,
   address3,
   )

with exactly 3 spaces at the start of every line but the first.  Then
I must be very careful not to do anything to cause Pine to rewrite the
addressbook itself, for instance by keeping my lists in a separate
addressbook, and turning off sorting of addressbook entries (either
that or make sure not to enter a new list which is out of alphabetical
order).

Of course if I am missing a simpler solution I would like to know...

Mark Crispin and the PINE team: here is _yet_another_ example of how
PINE's misinterpretation of the Newsgroups: header in a _private_
email message has caused someone great harm and chagrin. How much
longer can you continue to insist that this behavior should not be
changed?

In the meantime, I'd like to propose a new verb.

pine, v. [1] To _accidentally_ post a response to a correspondent's
_private_ email to Usenet, especially due to an exceptionally stupid
behavior in a mail reader. [2] To have a response to your private
email posted to Usenet, as per definition 1.

The similarity of the effects of the actions this word describes, to
being hit on the head with an actual pine cone, is intended.

Usage:
* "Oh, man! David just _pined_ me again!"
* "Laura's not talking to me any more, after I _pined_ her mail about
   her fantasies back to alt.sex.spanking."
* "AAAAAUGH! I _pined_ my message where I said what I really thought
   about my boss to our internal newsgroups! I'm going to go hunt down
   Mark Crispin and beat him with a rubber hose!"

> So how do I hack the source to change this awful and dangerous behaviour?

Alan Jaffray <jaffray@tezcat.com> provided this patch a while back. I
haven't had a chance to hack it into the PINE at netaxs.com, so I'm
not 100% sure if it will work, but I trust Alan.

Needless to say, I've started editing out the Newsgroups: header on
anyone I email now...

I'm starting an archive of patches to PINE to fix this problem. If you
have any others, please mail them to me. I'll make them available via
FTP and WWW.

I also would love it if all my "deleted" messages were stored in
a file named something like trash.  Yes, I know that I could save
them to "trash" but I'd like to just use the D key.  Anyone have
any ideas?

Thanks,

You might want to step back a moment and note that the RFC which defines
"newsgroups" as a header applies only to news, and not to mail. In mail,
"newsgroups:" is undefined.

Using the Newsgroups header for ANYTHING in mail is, "at best,
ill-advised". Putting it in is no worse than, an probably not as bad as,
assuming that it means something that it doesn't.

I am glad to see the pine team accepting that it is a problem and doing
something about it. I hope they will be quick to support and adopt the
proposed RFC which does clear up this mess.

In a previous article, jkm7670@hertz.njit.edu (Jim McConnell) says:

    There ain't no such thing.  Nearly all NNTP servers only permit
access to hosts within their own domain.


>nntp-server=gaia.ucs.orst.edu
>news-collections=*[]

    Leave the second entry empty, so long as the first is defined.


>news-collections=*{gaia.ucs.orst.edu/nntp}[]  we get an error saying we 
>are not allowed to access this site.  Do we have to be put on a list to

    The message you are seeing is what you will see if you telnet to
port 119 (the NNTP port) on the server:
502 You are not in my access file.  Goodbye.

    Yes, if you need to read from this site, you have to be added to the
list.  Unless you have some agreement with this site, do not expect it
to happen.  See if you can find a local service provider to give you
news service from their news server.

Michael Handler:

Before you post any further personal attacks on individuals, you would be
well-advised to ensure that your attacks are directed at the right
individual.  I did not write the reply code in Pine.

Most vendors do not read or respond to USENET postings in the newsgroup
dedicated to their product.  The staff members that once did so got tired
of being the brunt of personal attacks.  The attacks were often for no
reason other than they took the time to respond and explain things, and
thus became visible targets.

If the readers of comp.mail.pine would rather have silence than risk
getting an answer that they don't want to hear, I'll be happy to
unsubscribe and no longer answer questions.

But before I leave: that patch will disable follow-ups if you save a news
message to a folder for later reference and then access that folder.  Some
people do that, particularly if they want to compose a follow-up offline.
So be sure to tell them that you are breaking it before you install that
patch.

The main ftp site for it which is where it came from is 
ftp.cac.washington.edu, then go to the the /mail directory.  This is the 
University of Washington in Seattle, Washington i.e. in the state of 
Washington.

The versions of sz I have don't handle piped data either. But you can
do it with a little script:

	#!/bin/sh
	umask 066
	trap "rm -f /tmp/$$junk" 0
	cat > /tmp/$$junk
	sz /tmp/$$junk

Call it send or zap or download or whatever. You might prefer to create
a temporary directory and use a more meaningful filename in it since
Zmodem will propogate the filename to your local machine.

     How does one compile PC-Pine?  I see a makefile (makefile.msc) that
comes with pine-3.91.tar.Z, which wants to use "nmake" - what package is
nmake a part of?  Would the same package be used to compile the Winsock
version of Pine?  I'm familiar with compiling programs under Unix, but not
DOS, so if someone could give me a kick in the right direction, I'd be
grateful.  Thanks!

A signature file is just a flat text file that gets either appended or
prepended to your out-going mail message.

-- Start by going into pine, and enter SETUP (Config task).  You will find
   an entry labeled "signature-file".  Use the "?" command to get instruc-

   actions appropriate to those decisions.

   HELPFUL NOTE: You can use the "W" command and search for "sig" to

-- Then go back to the shell prompt, and by using a text editor (vi,
   emacs, or whatever you have available), create what you want it to say.

	PLEASE, oh PLEASE, keep it short!  2 or 3 lines, MAYBE 4.

Now you're ready to go.  The next message you send out will have your
signature file in it.

News vs email confusion.

There is no RFC-defined way to specify to which newsgroups email should
be posted.

>Like I said, I don't want to see another extended and pointless argument
>about this, so I'll stop now, and we can agree to disagree.

The trouble is that there is not only disagreement about how things
'should' be, but about how they actually are.  Example:  Your comment
about RFCs, which would lead readers into believing that there is some
RFC that requires that email with a Newsgroups header should be posted
to Usenet.

It's ok to agree-to-disagree about things that are a matter of opinion,
but it makes no sense to agree-to-disagree about simple matters of
fact, such as 'there is no such RFC'.

Rahul,
Thanks to both you and John S. for pointing out to me that the Newsgroups
header is defined in the news RFCs, not the email RFCs... but since I've
been involved in Arpanet/Internet messaging for over 20 years now, I think
I knew that already.

Now see if you can think of a model in which the *news* RFCs might be
relevant to a tool that was about to send a message out *somewhere* and
ALL it had available for deciding *where* and WHICH PROTOCOL(S) to use,
were the headers in the message it was given.

Over and out...

I use ^R to 'r'ead a file into the pine editor, is that what you want?

Hi! Just a quick question concerning integrating Procmail and Pine. If I have
incoming mail procmail'd into three or four folders <say folder1 through
folder4>, would I tell pine that folder[1-4] were incoming folders? If not,
how would I go about doing it so that pine could tell me which folders have
new mail, and which ones don't?

Thanks, in advance. :-)

Usually a signature file with UNIX is created by putting a .signature 
file in your home-directory. This .signature file is automatically read 
by Pine while composing a message. Be aware of the fact that pine 
defaults to putting the signature file at the top of your message. Use 
config to place on the bottom.

It sounds like you're using NCSA Telnet for the Mac.  What is
happening is that software is trapping ctrl-c's.  To undo that, press
APPLE-S and remover all the special control characters when the panel
comes up.

It sounds like the news server isn't accepting your machine.  Check

			   YES, IT IS FREE

			    Via the WWW:

A precompiled binary can be fetched from URL:

   ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed/pine-bin.osf.Z

But I recommend that you access Pine's web site, and browse from there:

for people interested, I wrote 2 small scripts, ed_alias (58 lines)
and pine_to_elm(18 line)
here is the ed_alias help:

usage: ed_alias [ -? | -h ]\

     The program edits your personnal pine alias file (in your .pine directory)
     which must already exist(if not, create it with pine)
     Old version is saved in addressbook.bak1 and addressbook.bak1 is saved in
    addressbook.bak2

     Then, addressbook is translated into elm format, and result is written
     in your elm alias file (in your .elm directory).
     This step in only performed if you have already a file named aliases.text
    in this directory) You can then use either pine or elm withe same
     aliases.
     Old version is saved in aliases.text.bak

     Editing is done with the editor whose name is in variable EDITOR,
     or in variable VISUAL, if EDITOR is undefined.
     Default is vi.
     Reminder: the field separator for pine is the TAB character, instead
     of '=' for elm.

     This works correctly with pine only if you choose the option
     'don't sort' in the pine configuration

It was not "given" a message. It was told to locate the message in the
user's mailbox. It contains "Received-By:" headers. It doesn't contain
a Path: header. Gosh, it can't be news, it's missing a mandatory
header.  It contains mandatory mail headers, and it came from a
mailbox, so maybe ... it's MAIL?

>Over and out...

%SYS-F-PROWORD Illegal use of prowords - contradictory.

Now imagine a model where the headers are defined which will identify
the transprot a message arrived via, and whether replies should be sent
via mail or news or both or neither. Have you joined mailnews-l yet?

    Sometimes when I read an email, either in my spool inbox or in one of
the incoming mail folders set up by procmail, I would like to download it
directly to my PC with Zmodem.  So far, I have to export it first to an
external file and then download that.  I am using Pine 3.91 on SunOS 4.1.4
with Unix piping enabled.  I tried piping directly to the 'sz' command,
but it was not happy.  Has anyone figured out a way to download a single
message directly from the viewer without having to go through an external
file first?  Thanks.  (P.S.  My telecomm software is ProComm Plus v2/DOS.)

Mark: the reason people beat up on you about the behaviour of Pine is simply
because you so aggressively defend it. If you don't want people to identify
you with this brokenness, then stop promoting it.

It's obvious by now that whether or not you wrote the code you would have
written code with the same behaviour.

Good. Since PINE doesn't tag messages in folders with their origin, that is
the correct behaviour. If you want PINE to be able to handle this case
differently, then have it add an extra header for that purpose.

Hello !

I have got (as you can see) quite a long mailaddress.
My login name however is a shorter one. I would like
to change the name PINE uses for my address to
alexander.dietrich because now it takes my login
name which is of course wrong.

Can anyone help me ?

Hello Folks,

I'm new to both Unix and Pine, having inherited a Unix SCO system when an 
employee abruptly left.  I noticed from the discussion on this list that 
it appears to be possible to get USENET news access with Pine.  Could 
someone point me to a FAQ on this or other docs?  

thanks in advance,
susan

If you are using PC-Pine simply give the name (including any directory 
path) to the file in the attachment header field.

If you are using Pine on a UNIX system you must first transfer a copy of 
your file from your PC's hard disk to the UNIX computer (remember to do 
this in binary mode).  Then start Pine on UNIX and type in the name of 
the UNIX file now holding your document in the attachment header field.

In the latter case I am assuming you are familiar with transferring files 
between your PC and the UNIX system.  If you aren't you should contact 
the people who support your PCs and/or UNIX system.

Come to think of it, if you have such people locally available why didn't 
you just ask your question of them rather than a collection of strangers 
scattered around the world who aren't familiar with your computer setup?:-}

When pine archives a month's worth of the fcc folder, does it simply save all 
mail in which is older than the first of the current month, or does it 
specifically extract only the mail sent in the previous month? I ask as we've 
recently switched from elm to pine and appear to have lost a large amount of 
sent email. The sent folder now contains only December mail, the 
sent-nov-1995 contains only November mail and of mail sent before November, 
there is no sign. (Before you ask, I have told pine to use the ~/Mail 
directory rather than ~/mail :-) ) It is entirely possible that someone has 
accidentally deleted the stuff (the account in question is a shared one), but 
I'd like to eliminate pine from the possible explanations.

Noticed from your header that you are using PINE3.89 The latest version 
is 3.91 which allows news reading and writing.

I've subscribed myself to a malinglist which delivers it's mail into the 
rfc1153-format. Does pine support this format or must a have an extra 
program. (I can read the messages but it isn't very practical).
I thank you in advance.

Jason,

In message "using attachments in pine?", you write:
>How do I get a file that I made in wordperfect for windows and use it in 
>an attachment in a message I am sending using pine?

I don't know about details specific to WordPerfect, but in general, when
editing the message's header, just use the ^J command (see bottom of
window) to get a prompt for a filename.  Entering the filename will cause
it to be attached to the message.  You can also enter ^T at this prompt to
get a list of ALL of the files in the current directory, from which you
can easily select the one you want.

Suggestion: to reduce your impact on the network, compress the file
before sending it.  This is not done in pine (at least, not that I
know of).  Be sure that the recipient can decompress it, before you
send a compressed file.

To simplify the transition from Elm to Pine, I wrote a silly Perl script
'elm2pine' to convert the aliases file. If you want it I can mail it to
you; if I get many requests, I'll post it here (it's small)

To start with, their on-line documents will found at URL:

	http://www.washington.edu:1180/pine/index.html

But, for most configuration work, I've never found it necessary to go
there.  I recommend using the built-in help.  Try going to Setup from
the main menu, choosing the Config sub menu item.  Then go down to
news-collections and press "?" for assistance.

Please note that I have never been able to get pine to successfully use
an IP address to specify a news server.  It can be entered, but then
from the FOLDER LIST, it says "No such host...".  You must use either a
hostname that your machine knows about, or a fully qualified hostname.

When I have a task like this (deleting all of MANY messages in a given
folder), I just go to the shell prompt and rm the folder.  I then touch
the folder to get a new EMPTY file.  (Be sure to check the protection
settings (ls -l), and set the new file as necessary (chmod).

extract from the reports received today (with senders' names removed).
Of these, we will probably read messages 91, 93, and 97.  We would
prefer subjects that are a little more descriptive than these, but...

Pine doesn't even check any of the messages.  It simply renames the
current sent-mail folder and creates a new empty one...

	Does anyone on the list know of a pc or Mac mail package which 
provides support for the Kanji alphabet? I believe Groupwise has that 
capability but would rather not use it.

	We have a 1 year appointment faculty member from Japan who is 
involved in a brain research project for our Medical School. He is 
interested in communicating with his colleagues back home, but would like 
to do so in his native language.

	Thanks in advance!

I'm very interested in this issue myself. I use Linux, not true
Unix, and have a few answers.

pine can *upload* mail to a POP account with no problem: you just
need to enter your SMTP server name in the pine configuration.

As far as I know, pine can't fetch mail directly from a POP
account, but there is a simple program called "popclient" which
you can execute with the name of a POPD server as argument, and
it will download all messages from the server into your Unix
in-box.  This program may be invocable directly from pine, but
I don't know how.  Source for the program is available at an
ftp address I don't have right handy...

As to using a POP login different from your Unix user ID -- I'd
love to be able to do that myself.  For the moment, I've created
an extra Unix account under the name used with my POP account, but
it's a real nuissance.  Realize, however, that pine would have to
use the POP-account login as the return address in messages it
composed for you; in general, the whole outside world will know
you by that name, only your Unix system will know you by your
user ID.

I've heard, but haven't used, of a program called 'remind' (surprisingly 
enough) which is supposed to be very good.

it seems that shift+tab will bring me to the top of my message being

jump all to the bottom (better than page at a time)?

thanks

Hello,

As a new user I have a question about adding 
folder collections using setup.

The problem is that adding a local folder-collection
makes it automatically the default for saves.
I would like to keep the remote collection the default
for saves, but allowing users to setup a local collection for
storing old mail.
Is there a way to do that?

Thanks!

Date: 6 Dec 1995 22:08:52 -0600
Message-Id: <4a5pck$108@ns.ccsn.edu>

   I have not had any luck compiling pine under Solaris 2.4.  The
binaries work fine, but I always have to add a fix that has been on the
pine wish list for the last 3 or 4 years and never implemented.
   I've compiled with the unbundled C compiler on a SPARC II and with gcc
2.7.2 on a SPARC 4.  Both times I did the "build sol".  It would go for
a ways and then barf on declarations.  I looked at the makefile.sol and
uncommented lines for gcc, but none of my modifications seemed to make
much difference.  Both systems do _not_ have the BSD compatibility
package installed.  I think it's a little odd that pine does not compile
out of the box.
   Has anyone figured out how to compile pine using gcc on Solaris?

Howdy all,

I use Pine on a UNIX system at Indiana University. Everything is great except 
I am running low on my allotted disk space on the server. Can anyone think of 
a way I can FTP my mail to my PC every once in a while, and still be able to 
read it if I have to.

I want to keep the mail in Pine format, so, are there any viewers.

Any and all help would be greatly appricieated.

Thanks,
Allen

    I had what apparently amounts to the same situation.  Accessing the 
folders, of course, is no problem, as they show up in my local folder 
collection.  I named them IN.this-or-that so that they would appear high 
up in the list of folders.

    However, Pine does not know about what is in them and does not tell
me how many files are in them until I actually open them.  I was able to
obtain a Perl script which I could modify to count the actual messages in
each folder (I commented out the display of names and subjects) and wrote
a front-end shell script to invoke the Perl script for my inbox and all
the incoming mail folders and display a summary count for each named
folder. 

    I can invoke it manually at any time from the shell prompt, and I have
it in my login so that I get the summary whenever I log into my account. 
I can mail the two scripts to whoever has Perl on their system.  (This is
for Unix Pine users only, obviously.  I use C shell, but it should be 
easily adaptable to any other shell.)

Well - there are two RFCs that define *message* formats for "Internet
Messages" (822) and "Usenet Messages" (1036), and a couple of other
ones that define various mail and news *transport* protocols. 

It states quite clearly that rfc1036 tries to be compatible with
rfc822. I'm quite sure that if the authors of 822 had known about
1036, they would have mandated a reciprocal compatibiility - however,
*somebody* had to come first.

  No - you're correct that there is no requirement that at message
with a Newsgroups: header must be posted. However, the RFC does
define that IF a message with such a header does ever manage to 
find it's way into the usenet news environment, then the Newsgroups:
header states which newsgroups it should, in fact, be posted to.
( I'm useing the vague term "usenet news environment" - however,
actually no such environment is defined in 1036. The News Transport
Protocol (NNTP) is defined in a separate document (977). 1036 does
have a brief discussion of using email as a news transport, but 
they suggest, that to avoid confusion, the news headers and message
be encapsulated. )
 
  Ok - I know Rahul knows all these numbers.  However, he seems to
remember them quite selectively, and it's convenient for his argument
to forget that the layering of protocols and the separation of 
concerns is one of the basic design principles of the internet. 

Message Format and Transport Mechanism are two totally separate
concerns. Saying you have to know the context of one to interpret 
the other makes about as much sense as saying that you can't read
this message correctly unless you know whether it happened to 
travel by Ethernet, T-3, ATM or PPP to reach you. 

Rahul woule like zip codes to mean one thing to the U.S. Postal
Service, and another thing to UPS, and then, if someone found
his letter lying on the ground and posted it for him, he would
complain because they didn't correctly guess which transport
he had intended. The only way to construct a rational world
is for addresses to always mean the same thing at all times.

Hey, Hey,

Here is my situation.  I as the unix sys admin receive mail from many
MAC users (msmail) who login to the unix servers.  When I receive 
their messages it appears to be in MIME format, therefore I must
press V to view the text (Latin text ISO-8859-1) of their messages.
This is not a big task, but after 5000000000000 times it can become
annoying.  

Is there a way to have pine automagically display the text when you 
select a message??????

Thanks,
Jason

I know where you are coming from!  Sometimes I get mail that is OBVIOUSLY 
text, but is broken up by MIME headers (stating that they are text!).  
This means various extra keystrokes.  Can we let pine simply DISPLAY 
those fragments that are text automatically, rather than go through the 
song and dance?

And another thing:  PrYnting such messages is less than optimal (one line

Oh no, it's no more a standard than any of the other IAB standards-track
Internet RFCs.  They are all just some misguided idea of how we can
talk to each other on the Internet without actually using standards.  :-}

Now, perhaps you'd care to enlighten us as to what your stringent
criteria are for determining when a standard isn't a "standard as 
such".  Perhaps you'd do us the courtesy of reading what is meant
by an "IAB standards track protocol" first, though, and checking for
the presence of that phrase in, say, RFC1521 and 1522.

		I have written to all of you before concerning my folder 
and how it was not accessible.  Now I have a little difficulty changing 
my password. Is there any information you can give me so that I can have 
access to changing my password.  I don't know what to do. Help Please!!!
After trying to change my password, the system told me that my new password
was not set. So every time I login I use my old password.

I'll make it two!!! |:-)

I'm on the exact same DG/UX release, and have the same
problem with the "reply" crash when it asks if I want to copy the body
of the previous message.

If someone could even point me in the right direction to look at the source
when this function of reply occurs, I could take a feable look at the code.

  It's a feature. When you forward an e-mail, Pine assumes that you type
your own words _before_ the forwarded message. So any recipients can first
read your own words, then read on to the forwarded message.

    To the best of my knowledge, Pine is *not* configurable in this
particular way without modifying the source code and recompiling.  The
Pine Development Team may be working on something like this, but I cannot
speak for them.  (The current Pine version is 3.91.)

    As I mentioned in my response, prior to actually sending any
email/post/reply/whatever, the sender does have full access to the
destination headers, but I admit that this does put the burden on the
individual to look before sending.  I have simply gotten into the habit
of doing so and glancing at the header fields before pressing the magic
send keys.

    For example, to respond to your message, Pine asked me whether I
wanted to reply to newsgroups.  When I said yes, it did not formulate a
header to send this to you also by email.  I had to add that back in by
hand, a feature which I myself find irksome in another way.  I have simply
learned to live with it in order to get other desirable features of 
Pine.  Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world.

I am helping someone, new to the net, learn to use pine.  Their sevice
provider is running Free Bsd and Pine 3.91.  They use a sinclair QL
computer.  The Y (print) command does not work.  I thought if I had a
better understanding of how the the command works I might be able to
fiddle around and get it to work.  Any suggestions?  Thanks for the help

I use pine to read usenet, but quite often when posting I like to cc an 
email to the person I am responding to. It gets there faster, and if my 
post is an explicit response, it insures that they will see it. Currently 
to do this I have to reply to sender, go up and ^R to get the rich header 
and then add in the appropriate newsgroup. 

Is there some way that this can be done automatically?

Well spoken answer; as pine sees no harm in inventing extra headers - so a
message can be "marked" as New, when old, and so that standard mail
checkers don't report it as actually being new, why not, when saving mail,
invent a header reporting the nature of the folder collection it came
from. 

Thus news postings saved into other folders can be automatically 
identified by pine, as having actually come from news.

Dear person behind the curtain,

I should have asked you months ago how I can access my account at UW. 
I am a grad student on leave to study in Taiwan for the academic 
year. I have a feeling that my acct in Homer is full of messages for me 
and that I ought to be able to read them from here. Can you help?

Sincerely,

The general philosophy you state sounds nice, but the conclusions you
have drawn from it are not good ones.  At the risk of deafening
readers, let me yell this out:

   I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT ANY OF THE AUTHORS OF THESE RFCS EITHER
   INTENDED, OR WOULD HAVE INTENDED, FOR A NEWSGROUPS HEADER IN EMAIL
   TO MEAN 'POST TO USENET'!!!

Such use for a Newsgroups header is an aberration of recent invention.
Please do not blame any of the RFCs for what is, ultimately, a software
bug.  I am sure that had any of the authors of the RFCs realized that
they would be quoted to support the broken software behavior that we
are discussing now, they would have rushed to add appropriate
disclaimers to their RFCs.

What RFC makes such a convoluted, hypothetical, and nonsensical
assertion?  I find no such assertion in rfc1036.  I do see that it
says:

    However, it should always be possible to use a tool expecting an
    Internet message to process a news message.

Which only means that it should be possible to feed to a mail-handling
program a News posting and expect it to do something reasonable -- such
as, for example, mail it to somebody whose address must also be
supplied.

But rfc1036 nowhere says the opposite, i.e., that it makes any sense to
feed an email message to a News program and expect anything useful to
happen.  They could have said this and made their statements
symmetrical.   They did not.  Case closed.

   THE RESULT OF FEEDING EMAIL TO A NEWS-HANDLING PROGRAM IS NOT 
   DEFINED BY THE RFCs.

Er, I am quite happy to separate message formats from transport
protocols.

The News vs email distinction is not a protocol-dependent issue at
all.  If you gave me sufficient money, I would happily implement
a software suite that would:

     Transport email via nntp and eventually deliver it into your mailbox.

     Transport News via smtp and eventually cause it to be installed in
     your News spool directory.

The distinction between email and news exists regardless of how they
are transported.  It is merely a matter of convenience that observing
that nntp is being used lets us quickly determine that News is being
transported.  In the UUCP world, both News and email are transported
via the identical UUCP mechanism -- the only difference is in which
command is executed at the other end, whether rmail or rnews, to accept
and process the transported data.  And yet, I have not seen UUCP users
get confused about whether something is News or email, and they don't
go crazy and begin posting email to Usenet under some pretence of 'got
to separate the transport from the message'.

I am so glad I am alive, because presumably if you came across my dead
body, you would get my address from my wallet and try to stuff me into
the nearest mailbox.  Or worse, get my telephone number and grind me
into sufficiently fine particles that could be stuffed into a telephone
handset.   Or even worse, get my email address, really grind me into
fine pulp, and try to pour it between the keys on your keyboard.

Dear Terry,

Your extensive experience does not help readers understand your
ambiguous statements any better.

Which protocol is used will usually be a site-specific question.  In
fact some sites will send News via UUCP to some other sites and via
nntp to some other sites and perhaps via an email gateway to yet other
sites.  To say nothing of leaf node sites that often use offbeat
protocols such as QWK packets.  The selection of protocol is based not
on News message headers, but rather, based on the destination site.

I suppose you might want to rely solely on message headers to decide if
it's News or email, but that too seems unwise.  If you *have* to do so
I suggest looking for a Path header.

Without taking either side, let me present an excerpt from a posting
by Mark Crispin that appeared on Usenet on March 8, 1995:

   The gist of the technical issue is this: there is no reliable way to
   determine what is "news" and what is "mail" to establish modal
   behavior.  If there is anyone who in sincerely interested in the
   technical details, I will be happy to explain.

   There have been a great number of suggestions on how to deal with
   the problem, for which we are grateful; unfortunately some of these
   are infeasible due to technical considerations.  We have already
   deployed several of the feasible suggestions.  These will be in Pine
   3.92.

   We are also actively investigating certain others, including a
   clever means (if it works -- not yet verified) of distinguishing
   between non-posted email from tin (et al) and postings.  It isn't
   yet certain whether this will be in 3.92; the jury is still out on
   whether or not the particular trick in question will work.

Is there any way to add vocabulary for the spell check?  At least, any 
way to skip censoring my name and email address... of course, without 
deleting my signature file?

This allows you either select a prespecified command, or to roll your

When I use pine to reply to a newsgroup posting, am I _only_ sending my 
message to the newsgroup, or am I also sending a duplicate to the e-mail 
box of the person who wrote the original?

To disagree with many of the postings on the "privacy" issue, it would 
seem to be improper to clutter up the e-mail slot of someone I don't know 
and don't do business with with my newsgroup responses.

	If your setup the read-messages folder all of your messages that 
you look at will be stored there.  That way you will have to delete them 
twice. Once in the folder they are saved to, and once in the 
read-messages folder.  Saving your deleted messages to afolder like 
"trash" is just the same as not deleting them in the first place. If that 
is your real goal then just don't delete them

Hi, 
I just wanted to give you the chance to earn some money in a very easy
way.A friend of mine turned me on a company called Intercall
Marketing, which
offers a nice, uncomplicated way to get some more cash, just by
callingthem and advertising a bit.
The number of the company is 
011-24-831-831 
(if you're calling from the USA, in other countries it's (i think)
++248-313131).

The call has a fee of $1.50, so I think (hope) this isn't to expensive
for the possibility to get some more money.

Now I'll try to explain how it works:

After calling the number a recording gives you deatiled informationon
what to to next. After a brief description you will be asked to enter
a six digit account number of the person  that gave you this number,
and this should be my account number.
It is -3 8 0 4 9 9- (this one is mine)
and then you can start to earn big money for nearly doing nothing. To
explain a little how it works, when you type in my account number, the
computer will give you you're own account number and a personal PIN
Number for your use only. Then it will record name and address for
future accounting needs, i.e. payments.

Here is where the money comes from:
For every call made to this number, intercall receives $1.50. 50 Cents
go to the account number you first typed in. But of course, now as
you've got you're own account, you'll want people to call and type in
your account number right away ! And I think, with the help of all the
networking systems around, it won't be a problem to reach many people.

Up to now its nothing special,
BUT IT GETS EVEN BETTER. You not only make 50 cents from the first
people who call using your number but also when they get people to
call using their number you get another 25 Cents from them, plus
another 25 cents from the people they get to call. So that means you
get paid 3 Levels deep, which could amount to some serious $$$.

An example:
If you get 100 people to call (by advertising in the net, or in the
local news papers), then you get 50$. If these people, let's say get
another 50 people to call, it's already $1,250. But the third  Level
is the most important one(so you should perhaps hurry a bit), because
if these people get 25 people each, that means that you'll get exactly
$31,250 (just imagine, if every Level would get 100 people, you would
get $ 250.000). Some good cash for nearly doing nothing, isn't it ?

If you're wondering why Intercall does this, realize that they get 50
Cents for every call. 1st Level=$0.50, 2nd Level=$0.25, 3rd
Level=$0.25 => $1.00. Remember that they'll get $1.50 for each call,
so that leaves 50 cents per call.

I normally dont try this things out. But it's (IMHO) not possible to
loose much money, and just paying $1.50 for calling, and then perhaps
getting much more cash, it's not too bad ?

But now I stop trying to convince you. You have to decide if this
possibility of earning cash is worth $1.50. Thank you very much for
reading, i hope it didn'T bother you.

Um, Pine is absolutely at fault here.  I didn't know there was anyone
that contested this.  It makes absolutely no distinction between email
replies to a post and posted replies to a post copied to email -- how
is one supposed to know whether to say 'no' or not?

Pine is a good mailer.  It also has an enormous user interface bug that 
this person rightfully pointed out.

  At least the second line should look like:

I believe I've figured out why Pine was not announcing new mail, even 
though the messages appeared in my INBOX.  I had not set a value for my 
inbox location on the setup/configure screen; it was simply using the 
system default.  Now that I have set the value to the actual mail folder 
on the system, I get a message announcing how many mail messages have 
arrived and who sent the most recent one.

I wanted to pass that news on, in case anyone else had the same problem.

Is it possible to have PINE automagically append a signature file based on
whether the message is local or non-local. I do this optionally by resetting
in setup - just wanted to do it without setup each time.

Why not leave to To: field blank, and enter just the BCC: addresses?  That way, the mail just shows their
address in the list, not a To: field with any name.  Works for me...

    When you go to reply and Pine sees a Cc: field, it may ask whether 
you also want to reply to whoever is in the Cc: field.  It may not check 
to notice that it is _you_ in the Cc: field, so if you reply to all, you 
should get mailed a copy of your own reply.

  Yes, it does, provided you learn how to use it effectively.

    If you don't want your response to be posted to a newsgroup, you can 
always say no.  And IN ANY CASE, you have complete manual control over 
newsgroup-posting and email-sending headers before you dispatch the 
message.  Please don't blame Pine because you are not taking the trouble 
to check the headers before sending to see that what you want gets done.

    Calm down.  All you have to do is answer 'no' when Pine asks you 
whether you want to reply to the newsgroup also.  Probably the original 
response you got had a newsgroup header it it -- that's the sender's 
problem -- so Pine is actually doing you a favor of allowing you to make 
a choice.  Is the cutler to blame if the surgeon is clumsy with the 
knife?  Pine is a good product.  Learn how to use it effectively before 
ventilating your pique in public.

I got tired of asking/looking for such functionality,

So it's ill-advised.  You know something?  It's too late.  It's an
ill-advised feature which has become part of over a decade of
Usenet software tradition.  When you send a reply via private mail
to a public message, the private reply has a "Newsgroups" header.
I would have expected a 20-year veteran of ARPAnet/Internet
messaging software to be aware of this in advance.

You cannot hope to reverse such a thoroughly entrenched convention
as this one simply by saying "we don't like it."  Any programmer
with an ounce of sense knows that, and the PINE team's obstinacy
in this regard continues to mystify me.

>Like I said, I don't want to see another extended and pointless argument

Well, I'm eager to continue an extended and pointless argument
about it, and I don't think the issue is moot.

You guys wrote a bug.  That's all -- end of story.  (How do I know
it's a bug?  Because it is a feature that is frequently and
consistently misunderstood by people at all levels of expertise:
newbies, net veterans, computer neophytes, PINE wizards, and
everyone in between.  That is practically the very definition of a
user interface bug.)

An important part of responsible and skillful software design is
knowing when you've fucked up.  Fucking up infrequently is a good
trait, and being able to fix your fuck-ups when they occur is
critical, but you also need to be able to recognize and admit to
your fuck-ups.

In this case, you are so insistent upon not admitting that you've
fucked up -- some bizarre, misplaced sense of pride? has Crispin
laid an Arrogance Field upon you all from which you are powerless
to escape? -- that you've allowed your fuck-up to persist for over
a year, to nobody's gain and everybody's loss.  Even when it comes
to the point where you cannot help but fix the fuck-up, it is more
important to you that people not believe it was actually your
fuck-up.  The idea that it was rn's fuck-up is ludicrous.

This is the very worst behavior that I have seen from a design
team in years.  You guys should go work for Netscape or something.
You really expect people to trust your software with their private
communications?

No, Terry.  The point is most definitely not moot.

    I don't think so -- I can successfully execute this command entered
by hand at the shell prompt right before starting Pine, which apparently
meets with failure, or else seems not to call the rsh.

    Is it possible that Pine might be trying the restricted shell?

    Has anybody successfully used Pine this way (passwordless authentication)
with a remote IMAP server from UnixWare?

The following was posted a while back on comp.mail.pine.  Just save the 
following as /usr/bin/spell.  (Be sure to chmod a+x /usr/bin/spell.)  If 
you want to actually use ispell for spell checking, set the "alternate 
editor" to /usr/bin/ispell -x.

Option 1:
Set your "alternate editor" to: /usr/bin/ispell -x

Option 2:
You can recompile applying the following patch written by John R. 
Violette and modified by me to invoke "ispell -x" instead of "ispell" (so 
you don't collect a bunch of backup files all over the place).

Subject: Pine, rimapd, and UnixWare...
Date: 7 Dec 1995 11:06:33 GMT
Message-Id: <4a6hrp$18c@news.ysu.edu>


Seeking out-of-the-box-compiled Pine3.91 for UnixWare...

    I am attempting to use Pine3.91 for UnixWare, presumably obtained
from the usle archives at ftp.novell.de or equivalent, as an IMAP and
SMTP client program.  This should be attempting to execute the command:
rsh IMAPHOST exec /etc/rimapd

    I am successful with Pine on other platforms.  I am able to make the
connection with no need to enter username and password, but when making
the connection from the pre-compiled UnixWare version, I am always asked
for login name and password.  I'm trying to migrate to a client-server
model with one central host handling all the mail instead of spreading
the delivery across many machines.  (Yes, being asked to debug the fourth
vendor-supplied version of sendmail.cf was too much.)

    From this UnixWare host, I am able to manually enter the command above
and receive the PREAUTH login, meaning it *should* work from Pine.  Also,
using Pine from another machine meets with success, so my suspicion was
that the UnixWare Pine was somehow not attempting this command.  (No, with
no compiler here, I can't compile, and the idea behind the UnixWear server
is that it's a plug-and-pray machine requiring as little administration
as possible.)

    On the imaphost machine, the tcp_wrapper package is running, logging
these rsh connections or attempts.  So, I decided I would look at the log
of connects, since the Pine debug file, even at level 9, shows no indication
of the failure of the rsh attempt.

    My manual rsh attempts are logged from the machine.  But when I try to
run Pine on the same machine, there is nothing logged.  This leads me to
strongly suspect that the UnixWare version does not attempt the rsh for
preauthenticated login, and instead goes straight to the port 143 connect
with manual login and password entry.

    Can somebody confirm this?  And better, can someone provide a pointer
to a binary of Pine which will run on UnixWare 1.1.4 and will attempt this
rsh login?

       Your help would be greatly appreciated -- without this, this school will
stick to having every host handle its own mail, with totally different
sendmails, and a much bigger administrative headache...


Thanks...

If you're running Windows, try my WinBiff program, at
http://www.tucows.com/files/wnbff32.zip.

The next version, due any day now, will allow you to specify
mailboxes other than the default inbox.

    Well.  I just had the *opposite* problem.  I *wanted* to post a
follow-up to a newsgroup, based on an e-mail copy I had sent myself of an
article which I had posted to Usenet.
    The e-mail copy was sent to my mailbox which I access with IMAP.  It
contained the Newsgroups: header.

    For the life of me, I could not get Pine to ask me if I wanted to
post to the newsgroup, much less to ask if I could confirm that thousands
of readers might be reading the message and killfiling me, and I'd be
costing hundreds of not hundreds of thousands of dollars, so do I really
want to post this.

    It seems that I had the behaviour everyone has been clamoring for,
but that's not what I wanted.  What have I done wrong?

    I was using 3.91 on SGI, the message in the IMAP mailbox arrived with
From:, cc:, Reply-To:, and Newsgroups: -- Pine ignored the last of these
and only asked questions based on the first three.

    Sigh...

Hi, folks!

Can anybody tell if the Unix and PC versions of Pine are identical?

I have following problem:

Pine 3.91 source distribution, compiled without any changes;
PC Pine for Windows 3.91 (if I can trust the header).

The problem is, PC Pine won't post News article when replying. That is, 
I have mail with Newsgroup: header, press R)eply, am aksed about text 
inclusion (or not, if set-up to not do so) and got NO question about 
Followup.

If R)eplying to the SAME message on Unix - it works fine.

Is it a bug or a feature? I find it at least annoying, not to be able to 
trust the program.

I cannot tell, looking at code, ANY difference in Setup, which can 
influence such behavior. PC Pine just doesn't do it.

BTW if I choose to followup, I loose the To: header; I would like at 
least to be asked if I want Follow-Up ONLY or also reply to sender.

thanks in advance

You're right!  According to the help text (when configuring), your sig
file is only put at the bottom on a REPLY, i.e. it says nothing about
FORWARD.  But, let's reflect on this a moment...

When one replies to a message, one normally want's the original text up
first, and responses after the text they apply to.  So, it makes sense
to put the final signature at the bottom of the whole message.

However, when one forwards a message, an explanatory comment is usually
put before the forwarded message, and it makes sense to "sign" that text
separate from the whole mail message.  Putting the signature after the
forwarded message sort of implies that you're signing someone else's
message...  hmmmm.  To me the current functionality seems to make more
sense.

As for your question, I don't believe there IS a problem.  Although I
haven't used many other Email systems, those I have used function just
the same way as pine does.  I suspect that it's functioning exactly as
it was designed to.

Now, if you would like an option to put your sig file AFTER your forwarded
message, you can make a request for that new feature.  But, realize that
pine is OFFICIALLY for those at the University of Washington; and the rest
of us use it through their generosity and good will.  In other words, you
can make a request, and they MAY honor it, but you have no right to expect
that they WILL honor it.

Hi !

>From RFC 1521:

      (7) Some mail transport agents will corrupt data that includes
      certain literal strings.  In particular, a period (".") alone on a
      line is known to be corrupted by some (incorrect) SMTP
      implementations, and a line that starts with the five characters
      "From " (the fifth character is a SPACE) are commonly corrupted as
      well.  A careful composition agent can prevent these corruptions
      by encoding the data (e.g., in the quoted-printable encoding,
      "=46rom " in place of "From " at the start of a line, and "=2E" in
      place of "." alone on a line.


As far as I can see PINE 3.91 handles "From " but not the single '.'.

The handling of "From " is controlled by the compile time define
'ENCODE_FROMS'. I have looked through the code but can't find any
corresponding code for handling of '.'.

Have I missed something or was this intentionally
left out from PINE 3.91 ?

Its all to common that buggy MTA's interpret '.' as the end of the
mail. Even if I have a correct MTA myself I can't controll the
receiving end (or intermediate MTA's).

Hi, all!

I already posted it, but it is getting really bad. I wasn't able for one
week to look into my post. When I tried to do it, I had (for example) one
folder with 99 messages (nice value) and other (pine-info! surprise) with
250 and some. 

It took 2 minutes 24 seconds to sort first and over 10 minutes the second!!!

I have PC Pine 3.91 for Windows with all folders remote - direct on LAN
(mailhost is 1m from PC). I OFTEN am off somwhere for one-two weeks. I
try to distribute the mail as much as possible.  But still I have at
times such sutuation with grown folders. 

ELM opens such folder at once; even Pine on Unix (without IMAP) makes it 
VERY fast. So it seems to be the problem of PC Pine.

It makes it impossible to use Pine for News-reading. I have 1.5KB/s 
link, and have to wait one hour befor Pine sorts some news-group.

I hope VERY MUCH that it will be changed in next version. It is a pity 
to see such a (bug?) in otherwise excellent program

regards

Pine is intended to be used by naive users. It should be designed to not

Hi!
I was wondering if Pine is able to forward mail that comes in on one of 
my address's, to my other (and most used) address?  

Thanks in advance!

I've successfully compiled the Pine source code on a Sun4 system.  It 
seems to work well, except it does not notify me when new mail arrives, 
except that the new messages appear in the INBOX.  I have seen Pine (on 
another system) print a message on the status line announcing there is 
new mail in INBOX and who has sent it.  How do I get Pine to announce 
when new mail has arrived?

The feature is always enabled -- there is no configuration option to
disable it.

This whole mess comes because PINE also tries to be a newsreader, and
the code for the two functions is so tangled together that they can't
stop this functionality for mail without adversely affecting
newsreading. Or somesuch other lame excuse.

Message-Id: <ud91kmnmkl.fsf@yoyo.weeg.uiowa.edu>

I built pine-3.91 for SGI IRIX 5.3.  Everything seems fine except for one
annoying problem.  Pine does not recognize that my remote sessions support
more than 24 lines.

I set the environmental variable LINES to 36 and all apps (e.g., emacs,
more, man) acknowledge the 36 lines.  Only Pine refuses to accept it.  I
should mention that if I connect to an AIX system, issue "stty rows 36"
and then rlogin into my SGI, then Pine acknowledges the 36 lines.

For fun, I rebuilt Pine with these parameters:
     #define USE_TERMINFO
     #define DEFAULT_LINES_ON_TERMINAL     (36)
But, no go, pine still insists on 24 lines.

Yes. just press F and enter the new address.

But if you want to forward the email automagically, then you shouldn't ask the
mailREADER for it, that's a job for the mailTRANSPORT.

PINE is just a reader, so you may have luck and can create a file named ".forward"
in your home-directory (without the quotes:-) ) containing the new address.
This is the usual way on (most?) unix-systems. For PC, well, lucky me, I don't
have to use one;-)

I'm yet another Pine (Linux) user with locked INBOXes.

I've seen dozens of references to this problem in the archives, but I 
haven't seen anything that tells me how to fix my system.

I don't have multiple pine sessions open.  I cant see any problems with
my /var/spool/mail files, etc.  Where is this lock file?  How can I reset 
the damded thing and get on with my life???

Hi

I am currently trying to install the Yehavi Bourvine version of PINE
(3.91b5) on my VMS system, 
but I have a few problems...

I have successfully installed the VAX VMS version using
OpenVMS 6.2
Netlib  2.0
UCX     3.3 ECO #1

The only modfication I made to the code was to add the following line to 
[.c-client]vms_mail.c

#define UCX 1

This was because the code has some #ifdef's for UCX (or so it appears). I have 
also added searches for "X-Mailer" and "X-sender" in the three functions for 
looking at RFC822 headers:

           (search(record, size, "x-mailer:", 9) == T) ||
           (search(record, size, "x-sender:", 9) == T) ||

These were suggested to me by my colleague Alan Flavell at the University Of 
Glasgow.
I compliled using VAXC, because I encountered some errors with the DECC complier
i.e. CC = "CC/VAXC"

I have encountered major problems with the Alpha version. I am running the same 
versions of the above software with DECC v5.0, rather than using the VAXC
compiler.

When I compile, I get the following warnings from [.c-client]vms_build.com

%LINK-W-NUDFSYMS, 2 undefined symbols:
%LINK-I-UDFSYM,         MAILDRIVERS
%LINK-I-UDFSYM,         STDPROTO

This seems to be carried through to the [.pine]vmsbuild.com where I get the

Good question.  The short answer is that it's a deficiency in IMAP2.
IMAP4 can fix it, and a workaround can be done with IMAP2.  But nobody has
been interested in doing the work in Pine 3.92.  I don't know when it will
be done.

However, you may be screwed anyway, depending upon the vagaries of your
email transport; if it changes things so that the Newsgroups header
appears to be false, then it won't be recognized.

Zach, 
 
 
Press ^Z.  This gets you to the UNIX prompt without closing 
pine.  At that prompt, type pico.  Press Enter.  That puts 
you in the pico editor.  Begin composing.  Periodically, save 
or write out to the SAME filename.  (Choose a single-letter 
filename for convenience.)  After each save or write-out, at 
the prompt type pico. Press Enter. In pico, press ^R, then 
enter filename.  Press Enter.  Continue composing.  Choose a 
period for the cycle that you feel comfortable with.  Upon 
completion of the composition, save it or write it out.  Exit 
pico. 
 
Again at the UNIX prompt, type fg (=foreground) to get back 
into pine.  Enter compose-message screen.  Bring the cursor 
down into the message BODY.  Press ^R.  Enter filename of 
composition.  Press Enter.  To then get to top of the message 
body, press ^W followed by ^Y.  Move cursor into header and 
make the appropriate entries.  Send message. 
 
If you have a sent-message folder, you then can press ^Z and 
at the UNIX prompt type rm <filename>.  Again type fg to get 
back in pine. 
 
Of course you can start in the compose-message screen, make 
the appropriate header-entries, put cursor in BODY of message, 
press ^Z, type pico, etc. 
 
Yes, it's inconvenient.  But if the composition is important 
and long, it's much more inconvenient to lose it. 
 
If the system goes down while you're composing, the FILE con- 
taining almost all of your composition will almost always be 
restored when service resumes; and sometimes you'll even get 
a message that you can retrieve what pico itself dumped when 
the system went down.    
 
 
Cordially, 
 
Jim

The UNIX and PC versions are identical with regard to news.

However, the Newsgroups: header isn't transmitted over IMAP2.  You are
probably using IMAP from PC Pine and local access from Unix Pine.

I don't know when this will be fixed.

    Pine by itself will not do this.  You can use other programs to 
preprocess your incoming mail into folders which Pine can then read (at 
least with Unix Pine).  If you have a Web browser, look at my home page 
and follow the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  She has material there on 
mail filtering.  (You will have to follow several links to get to stuff 
on procmail and elm filtering.)

  You mean Blind Carbon Copy (BCC)? When you're composing an e-mail, press
^R while the cursor is on 1 of the header fields. Then you'll see (r)ich
headers, including the BCC field. You can then enter addresses into the
BCC field.

Here's the detailed answer on how to get Pine to recognize those
folders as incoming-mail folders.  I'll assume that the folder is on
the same server as your regular mail (i.e. you aren't wanting to use a
folder IMAPed from another server [which might be very useful, though,
and can be done]).

>From the main Pine menu, go to the "L"ist of folders.

While your cursor is somewhere in the "Incoming Message Folders" area
of the screen, press "A" to Add a folder.

You are asked: "Name of server to contain added folder: " Just press
return.

You are asked: "Name of folder to add " Type in the pathname to the
folder you wish to add, relative to your login directory (not just the
filename within your mail directory).  So, if my mail folder directory
is called "mail" within my home directory, and I wanted to mark the
folder "IN.anemo" as an incoming mail folder, I'd enter "mail/IN.anemo"
(without the quotes, of course).

You are asked: "Nickname for folder "mail/IN.anemo": " Enter a single
word that will appear as the folder name in the "Incoming Message
Folders" list.


Now, when you fire up Pine, you can first go to your standard INBOX
folder.  When that's done, press the <TAB> key, and you'll move to
the next incoming-mail folder that has new mail.  All of your incoming
mail folders will appear at the top of your "L"ist of mail folders.

Nifty, eh?  Coupled with filtering by procmail, this can make going
through the mail far, far easier, particularly if you subscribe to a
number of different mailing lists.  Don't overlook procmail's ability
to filter out all but one of a duplicated message sent to multiple
mailing lists (hence arriving multiple times to your account) -
relieves a lot of annoyance for me.

I Cced Mark, and during the exchange of messages he called me all sorts of
interesting names. More to the point, though, he told me that:

	1. They have been discussing how to deal with this problem since
	   last November.

	2. The final changes were made, by Mark, in March.

So all the while he's been publicly denying that there's a problem he's been
working on fixing it. That they've been so careful in designing the fix is
admirable, but why they have been publicly so adamantly opposed to admitting
they have a problem that everyone, including themselves, can clearly see?

I honestly can't imagine what their motivation could possibly be. This sort
of public-relations stonewalling is the sort of thing you associate with
corporations like Intel and Microsoft, not volunteer freeware authors.

I will, of course, refrain from directly quoting Mark's private email without
permission.

Subject: Problem with pine on a distributed environment
Message-Id: <DJDGuI.K41@world.std.com>
Date: Sun, 10 Dec 1995 13:15:54 GMT

Hello, everyone.  I am having trouble performing operations, such as 
deleting messages, within folders of pine running on a distributed 
environment, and I understand the problem is with the system's 
inability to establish a proper lock file.
 
One of the systems to which I have access (not the beautifully-run one 
from which this post comes) runs in a distributed environment.  When a 
user calls pine, the system performs an IMAP login to the user drive 
on which the pine mailbox folders are located.  However, all the other 
pine folders are on whichever drive the user's account is on.  
Consequently, my sysadmin tells me, when a user wants to perform an 
operation on a folder other than the mailbox one, unless he is logged 
on to the user drive on which his account lives, it fails because pine 
can't establish a proper lock file.
 
I am wondering if there is a way of using pine in such a distributed 
environment so that it will work with its full folder functionality.  
My sysadmin tells me he once tried to get an answer from this group, 
but his queries went unanswered.  Can someone point me towards some 
documentation that will help solve this problem?  My sysadmin is 
swamped and would rather not devote time to the problem, so I'm taking 
it upon myself to see if there is an easy fix.
 
Thanks for all help.

There is actually another subtle point here.

The Newsgroups header has *never* meant 'post this to these
newsgroups', not even when used in News postings.

Once a decision to post has been made, then the list of newsgroups will
be obtained either from the Newsgroups header or from the Followup-to
header if it exists, as appropriate.  In the case of control messages,
the software may perform some mapping between what a Newsgroups header
says and where the posting actually goes.  (E.g., the Newsgroups header
might say comp.mail.pine.ctl but the posting might go to comp.mail.pine
and/or to control and/or to control.cancel.)

To emphasize again, the Newsgroups header is *never* a request to
post.  I am making a distinction here between a command such as 'please
post' and data such as 'here is a list of newsgroups that may be
used'.

The request to post must occur via some other mechanism:

   - Piping something to inews is a request to post.
   - Using the POST command as nntp client is a request to post.
   - Using the IHAVE command as nntp peer is a request to post
     (really request to propagate).
   - Using a follow-up command in a news reader is a request to post.

Contrariwise:

   - Using a reply command is never a request to post, not even when in
     a news reader (use the follow-up command instead).
   - Using a reply command is never a request to post when in a mail reader.
     *** Pine authors please note. ***
   - The mere presense of a Newsgroups header in anything (whether email
     or News) is never a request to post.
     *** Pine authors please note. ***

In all fairness, let's note that making it hard for you to duplicate
via email a Usenet posting is desirable behavior.  Only a very small
fraction of Usenet users want their mailboxes to be cluttered with
isolated fragments of Usenet discussion threads.  Those who wish to
save selected postings can do so themselves -- you or I are not in any
position to guess which specific Usenet postings others wish to save.

Those who wish to receive entire newsgroups by email have already made
such arrangmenets and no help should be required from the rest of us.

You don't use Pine, and based entirely on hearsay you complained about a
problem which does not exist and can not exist in any released version of
Pine.

We were working on the real problem -- in fact we had solved it -- but you
and your coherts kept on bringing up this nonexistant problem

You were never stonewalled.  You were told what the facts were.  You
choose to ignore them.

You even harassed me about this on alt.sys.pdp-10, of all inappropriate
newsgroups!

Perhaps the next time that you think that you are not being answered, you
should try listening.

This is one of those rare cases when:

   It turned out to be a feature.

People who send you email that happens to contain a Newsgroups header
will thank you if you don't try too hard to get this bug fixed.  It is
preventing you from accidentally posting private email to Usenet.  So
it's a feature.

I am running Pine 3.91 on my ULTRIX account and have never had any

  For some reason, it will not permanently add some newgroups nor

I don't know if you are the group I should be asking this question of, 
but here it goes.

I have an account at the Univ of New Mexico. I can access it via local 
telephones from home or directly at school. My question is, when I go on 
vacation, is it necessary for me to call long-distance to these local 
numbers in order to gain access or is there some way to make use of local 
calls around the country to access it? For instance if I am in San 
Francisco is there some local number (say for SFSU) whereI could call and 
from there login to my accoutn in New Meixco?  This seems familiar but I 
don't know the validity or method by which I do this. Assuming I can find 
the local dial-in numbers where-ever I am, how do I get to my account?

Thanks Steve

Seasons' greetings,

question 1:
Is there any capability like "killfile" available in PINE?

question 2:
Is there any program/script already written that accepts a mail-folder
file as input and performs operations on it? (like deletion)
What I have in mind is not a "proc mail" type application that are
really overkill for what I am after. Something simple will do ...

Not "all".  It would be useful to ensure that your terminal/emulation
has actually been configured to display ISO-8859-1.  Otherwise the
display could be rather confusing.
 
PINE has no idea what character code your display has been set to,
and has no way to change it.  For correct results you should set the
terminal to match the PINE setting.

In a previous article, werner@world.std.com (Craig Werner) says:

    This is only giving you half of the flexibility IMAP can provide.

    Not quite understanding exactly what you mean, I can think of two
known problems.  If the machines share the folders/home directories with
NFS, file locking is hopelessly broken.  This should just mean that two
programs attempting an operation on the same folder aren't aware of each
other, so if one makes a change, the other sort of shrieks about it.
    The other possibility is that the folders are local to the machine
from which you are logged in and not shared.  This would mean they are
only visible when you're on that machine.


>I am wondering if there is a way of using pine in such a distributed 
>environment so that it will work with its full folder functionality.  

    Sure there is, but it requires a central location for the folders,
which shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and the advantages of which
ought to outweigh the time needed to set it up.

    The particular solution will depend on your situation.  Does your
IMAP INBOX server also have access to your folders?  Then configure Pine
so all folder references are not to the local machine ( mail/[] and so on)
but to the IMAP host with these folders ( {imaphost}mail/[] and so on).
This also works for postponed messages, so you can move between machines
and pick up where you left off.  This is easy enough for you to do from
the configuration screen; the sysadmin need only modify the pine.conf file
to enable this for all users.
    (Note that this does not work for everything, such as addressbooks,
and IMSP with IMAP4 addresses this.)
    If a different machine is the primary store for your folders, then
substitute that machine name for the IMAP host, assuming those machines
are running an IMAP server.

    Using IMAP to access the mail folder works around file locking problems
associated with other access methods, and it can work successfully with a
minimum of effort.  (I use it.)

    It is assumed that all mail folders are in a directory (mail or Mail)
in the user's home directory.  If you want both incoming mail and the mail
folders to be on a machine users do not typically log into, and have no
real need for them to be in the user's home directory, then an IMAP4
server such as the CMU Cyrus server provides this functionality.


>Can someone point me towards some 
>documentation that will help solve this problem?

    The best I can say is that the IMAP access format used by Pine works
for folders as well as the INBOX, so by changing this, you'll be using IMAP.

Message-Id: <1995Dec10.232514.17970@rgfn.epcc.edu>

I cannot enter the Pine mail-reader on my network and can't determine 
why. It worked okay when I logged on earlier today.

SYMPTOMS:

1. I type pine at the TENET Unix prompt

2. I get the Pine Main Menu with the following at the bottom of the menu:
   HOST: Paula-Formby.tenet.edu  ENTER LOGIN NAME:lscroggs

3. I press the enter key.

4. The following appears at the bottom of the menu:
   HOST:Paula-Formby.tenet.edu USER:lscroggs ENTER PASSWORD:

5. I have tried different entries. ie. press enter, type in my 
Tenet password with no success.

6. I always get the following error response:
   Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
 
       Attempting to save debug file to /tenet/d72/lscroggs/.pine-crash
 
Abort process

7. I am then returned to the TENET Unix prompt.

Everything else ( telnet, newsgroups, gopher, Lynx) works well. 

Does anyone know what is happening and how I can correct it? Thanks for 
the help.

    Not in Pine as such, no (at least not in the current release).  You 
need something to weed out the mail before Pine gets it.

    Other than procmail itself, I myself do not have anything.

A realistic approach for you should be to switch to a mail agent that
doesn't put bogus "Newsgroups" headers into your mail.

You need someone at the locality where you are to let you dial into thier 
(local) phone # and account (doesna matter if it's San Francisco or 
Pennsylvannia or Monte Carlo or South Africa) then TELNET to your server 
and login to your account.  Check with your sys admin at unm.edu to see 
if they allow incoming telnets, most do, some do not.  Hope this helps.  
Please feel free to email me if you need further help, as yer correct, 
this probably has nothing to with PINE except that yer trying to read

Newsgroups headers in email are not bogus.  They are used to tell the
recipient in which newsgroup he had posted something that resulted in
an email reply to him.  This is useful information for the human
reader.  This information is not intended for automatic processing by
the mail agent.

For example, if I had chosen to send an email reply to your posting, it
would have included a header like this:

   Newsgroups: comp.mail.pine,news.admin.misc

BTW, it is good to minimize News vs email confusion and remember that
programs generally known as mail agents do not include a Newsgroups
header in email.  It is News agents that do this, when they temporarily
act as mail agents solely to allow a user to send an email reply to a
Usenet posting.

Pine's current MIME support is very poor.  I have had to resort to Elm
because of -- get this -- the inability to attach plain text files in the
text/plain format without encoding!  This is not good.

Also, is there any potential for adding PGP support to Pine?  Again, this is
already in elm+pgp+mime package that I have had to resort to.

  I don't know about others, but once PGP 3.0 is released I am planning 
on making a version of Pine that will smoothly work with PGP.  Right now 
you can use a program called mkpgp.  This is a script program for working 
with PGP.  Enjoy.

Try e-mailing somebody AT that university, rather than asking a mailing 
list devoted to the development, installation and support of piece of 
software (called "Pine") to let you read and send mail!

You could try asking this in the "news.newusers.questions" newsgroup 
rather than here.  This is primarily for discussion about the mail 
program called "Pine".

In a previous article, mrc@CAC.Washington.EDU (Mark Crispin) says:

>Good question.  The short answer is that it's a deficiency in IMAP2.

    To all sysadmins who have been complaining about this problem, here
is your solution.  Just start an IMAP server on your mailhost (I've wanted
to see IMAP daemons become as ubiquitous as POP servers for a long time),
and configure Pine to access inboxes and folders with IMAP.  This will
also help you migrate to a client-server IMAP mail model more quickly.

    Personally, I'll wait for IMAP4 clients, before rekindling this
debate by asking that Pine *do* posts to newsgroups when the header is
in a message accessed with IMAP2bis.  I understand the mechanics of the
variety of protocols and transfer agents that can be involved, and the
solution cannot be as clear-cut as some less-informed individuals would
like to believe.

Hi
I formed in my address book a mailing list. Now I would like to add entries
to that mailing list simply by using the T - Take Address key which appears
when viewing the mail folder.
Usually the address is added to the simple list  in the address book, but
not to the mailing list which should then be edited manually.

Please send answers to my private email address, and I will update the list.
                                                       Thanks, Drora

Thanks for the suggestions,

I have tried to change the character set to ISO-5589-1 but
this does not seem to help.  I have tried on RS6000/AIX 325, 
HPUX 10, and SGI/IRIX but I still get the following after I 
select a message;

I'm making the move to Solaris 2.4, and tried to compile Pine 3.91, but
ran into a minor snag.  Here's the error output

Making Pine.

Has anyone been able to compile Pine under Soalris 2.4 using Sun C? 
If so could you please provide me with the necessary changes to compile pine.

Thanks

I subscribe to a listserv group that issues only a digest version of

each digest AND a header before each posting.  Does anyone know how I can 
strip these before reading?       TIA     jeanxyz

Subject: PINE for AT&T Unix 3.2???? where?
Message-Id: <sinnersDJFM20.I8p@netcom.com>
Date: Mon, 11 Dec 1995 17:03:35 GMT

I have tried running the SCO release of PINE 3.91 on an AT&T unix box 
without luck.  It is kind of odd since we have installed most of the SCO 
uucp subsystem on this machine without any problems.

Is there a binary out there for the AT&T Unix 3.2 platform?  I haven't 
seen one that is explicitly noted as compiled for that platform at 
ftp.cac.washington.edu ... any ideas?

PS .. the problem I am having with the SCO-PINE on the AT&T machine is 
when I try to execute it, I get the main menu displayed on the screen but 
it immediately dumps me to the o/s prompt.  When I peruse the 
/.pine-debug1 file I can see an error related to "Select; Illegal arguement" 
as a "PINE PANIC:" error message.

sort of like:	PINE PANIC: Select; illegal arguement

If this is of help .. I will be glad to post the debug file or portion of it.

Thanks very much ....

Help!

Is there any way to get Unix Pine to attach plain-text ASCII
files *without* encoding them in MIME format?  My recipients
are on Compuserve, and apparently their mailreaders don't
know how to decode the MIME-encoded attachments.  I haven't
been able to figure out how to convince Pine *not* to encode
the attachments.

Thanks,
Richard

    Sorry, but this is part of Pine's behavior, and I know of no way to

We've had difficulty with mailing lists because of system parameters set 
external to Pine that restrict the number of addressees for email. So
we had to split a list of several hundred addresses to 100-name chunks.
You might ask your mail or system administrators if they've
imposed such restrictions.

Mark, that's simply not productive.  rn was around *LONG* before Pine ever
showed up, and putting the Newgroups: line in responses to postings is the
accepted behavior.  Almost every Unix newsreader I've used does that.

Any Internet-related software needs to allow for and work with the existing
software.  There's simply *far* too large of an existing software base to
expect it all to change because you want to do something different (even if
what you want is better, which I disagree with).  Saying "then fix the
existing software" is not an acceptable answer.

If the Pine development team has decided that they are simply going to
refuse to change this, fine.  It's their software; they can do whatever they
please.  Just say so, so that the rest of us can start actively encouraging
people to use a different mail reader that can better handle the realities
of Internet communications.

Printing messsages in Pine using the attached-to-ansi printing option
works in several configurations we have here (Mac NCSA Telnet 2.6 and 2.7; 
PC/TCP and WinQVT). One of my clients says it's not working in a
Microsoft TCPIP environment, but I don't consult on PC's much so I can't
help. Does anyone here know if this can be done in the Microsoft
environment?

A response by email would be nice, but I will be checking the newsgroup.

Take a look in your pinerc-file. It will tell you name and location of 
your folders (saved-msg-name-rule).
(often ~/mail/sent-mail under unix, \PINE\something under DOS)

That's like saying "you don't drink and drive, and based entirely on
heresay you complained about a problem that doesn't exist in our cars
and can not exist in any released version of our cars".

The problem I'm complaining about is:

	1. Pine loses the distinction between news and mail.
	2. People are getting hurt as a result.

You stated flat out that there is no way to distinguish news and mail. Many
people, myself among them, disagreed. You made some changes in the user
interface, but people kept on getting hurt. You did not clearly indicate
that further changes were being contemplated, choosing instead to harp on
this philosophy you have that news and mail should be indistinguishable.

I'm really glad to see you found a solution, but all these red herrings
are beside the point. I don't need to drink and drive to get hit by a
drunk driver. I don't need to use Pine to be aware that there's a problem
with it.

> You even harassed me about this on alt.sys.pdp-10, of all inappropriate
> newsgroups!

I don't think I brought the subject up in a.s.p10, but it's possible. But
once it came up I consistently reset followups *out* of the group because
it *was* inappropriate. Why people insisted on setting them back is not
something I care to speculate and in any case is beyond my control.

Perhaps the next time that your answer doesn't seem to be accepted, you could
try listening to the question again.

Friend, 
 
 
Export the document you wish to forward to a one-letter 
filename.  Open the compose message screen.  Complete 
header.  Complete your message.  Four lines below your 
normal (not .signature file) signature, type INCLOSURE: 
and drop down two more lines.  Press ^R.  Type the one 
letter filename.  Check over your message for readabil- 
ity, making necessary corrections.  Press ^X. Type y. 
 
Keep the one-letter filename for re-use.  When you ex- 
port another document to it, choose overwrite (or in 
appropriate circumstances append). 
 
Continue the cycle as needed, never failing to check 
for readability. 
 
Cordially,

Have you tried Unix pine with imap? If this is OK, PC pine is the problem.
I've seen exactly the same thing as you.

but doesn't get returned?  The reason for this is to put a dummy
name such as To: distribution <nobody@nowhere>, and put the real recipients
in Bcc for big lists.  Addressing it to myself is the current scheme,
but then sometimes people think the mail is not for them.

Please email to zach@world.std.com.  Thanks.

  I do not use any MacIntosh, but I heard some Mac mailing program tags
sent messages with a name (I think it was ``Message Body'' or something
similar) so that message bodies appear as attachments. If I remember well,
one man from Sveden created a patch (for some platforms only--including
SGI and HP) which solves it. But I am not sure I can publish his patch as
I received it personally. I will try to ask him (or maybe he wiil read
this notice and answer himself).

mbox holds your "saved" and "sent" letters, it does not hold
"incoming" letters which you delete. incoming letters are
usually held in /usr/spool/mail/ directory, not in your mbox....

Simple, just hit "m" for main screen, and then hit "q" for quit....

You should be able to see a list of commands at bottom of your
screen if you forget the commands...

Hit m to return to the main menu.

Hit q to quit.  Then respond to Pine's queries as to whether you want to 
expunge messages marked 'deleted'...

Hello,

When someone on my system is running pine and I type 'w' at my prompt to 
see who is logged on, I see a number under the WHAT field of the person 
using pine, instead of seeing 'pine'. What does that nbr correspond to? 
Any ideas how to fix that?

There's a command to change that header to
X-Newsgroups-because-Pine-is-braindead: which won't cause
unintentional posting when you mail to naive users.

So, something like below should do the trick:

-- snip snip --
#! /bin/ksh

TMPFILE=/usr/tmp/pico.spell.$$

cat > $TMPFILE
ispell $TMPFILE
cat $TMPFILE
rm $TMPFILE

-- snip snip --

Beware, should work does not mean will work. I tried the above and it 
appears that ispell can't access the tty while pico is still on. So, it
didn't work for me.

Indeed, I have.  But (surprised?) this doesn't quite solve the
problem for me: as a newsgroup moderator, I sometimes receive
"posts" sent to my mailbox made by unsuspecting users.  Since I
cannot tell that there is anything out of the ordinary about these
posts, I go ahead and approve them, which then creates no small
amount of displeasure on the part of the wronged parties.

Any ideas, O Insightful One?

We've just installed pine on our system.  It's great!  I was just
wondering what are these .pine-debug files that appear in each user
directory?

Hello,

two days ago I sent a message to your robot !!!

Your robot told me to use this Mailadress, because the other adress is a 
robot adress. So I am doing as your robot told me !!!


I wanted to tell you, that the program pine is a fine thing for writing 
mails.

The only problem, which some people would have is the englisch.

The problem is, that there are no books in German for learnig "How to use 
pine". Not everybody is speaking English.

I am sure, that I am doing a lot of mistakes.

I hope, that you think about this lines !!!

If possible, please answer this lines.


Yours


Steffen

Yes, done. (On the same host, but it shouldn't make any difference). It 
works excellent. So it seems to be the PC Pine version problem.

In hope, that it will ever be fixed :-)

Hi all!

Is there any way to delete or rename ALIAS for incoming folder and not the 
folder itself (that is, corresponding file).

I tried it with Pine 3.91 on Unix, folders are local, and if I try to 
delete a folder in incoming collection it is lost forever!! I cannot 
also rename the folder (or rather alias) - hitting R I get only error 
message. So to rename the incoming folder I currently have to copy it, 
delete old and create new with new name.

Do I miss something?

thanks in advance

No, but here's how to get much the same effect:  Create a generic
.signature file that Pine will read in automatically when you compose a
message.  Also create one or more special-purpose signature files under
other names to use when your standard .signature isn't appropriate.  To 
use one of the special-purpose signatures, use ^K to delete the standard 
one from your message and ^R to read in the new one.
 
That's a lot easier than changing your Pine configuration each time you 
want to switch signatures.

I just wanted to add a little more information on this.  In pine 3.92,
when we do encode we will encode the lone dots.  Defining ENCODE_FROMS
will trigger encoding based on "From "'s or "."'s.  Dot is not handled in
3.91.  Thanks.

Here's the "canned answer" I send to our users who ask about printing 
from Pine.  It's long...

-----------------------------
 
The standard way to print a message while in Pine is to press "Y" while 
viewing the message oe while the message title is highlighted in the 
folder index.  If the printing mode is set to "attached-to-ansi" (the 
default) in Pine's setup, Pine sends the appropriate VT100/ANSI commands 
to print the message on a printer attached to your terminal.
 
This works fine if you are working at a real VT100 or VT102 terminal with
a serial connection to the host computer, but you are not.  Instead, you
are using a personal computer with telecomm software set to emulate a
VT100 or VT102 terminal, and you are connected to the host via modem.
 
Many telecomm programs don't understand the VT100/ANSII printer commands
sent out by Pine when you press "Y" to print a message.  This isn't Pine's
fault, its the fault of incomplete implementation of VT100 or VT102
terminal emulation in the telecomm software.  Unfortunately, there are 
very few telecomm programs that have a really complete implementation 
of VT100 or VT102 emulation.  Most of them handle VT screen display 
adequately, but fall flat when it comes to useful things like printing.
 
It also isn't your printer's fault that you can't print properly from
Pine.  If your printer can print from other programs you use (word
processor, spreadsheet, or whatever), then it would print messages from
Pine if your telecomm program handled the VT100/ANSI printer commands
correctly. 
 
There are several workarounds you can try.  The first step in each of 
them is to save the message as a file in your home directory, as follows:

o While viewing a message in Pine, press "E" to export the message.
o When Pine prompts you for a file name to save to, enter a short easy to
  remember name.  Do the same for every message you want to print.  If you
  want each message to be in its own seperate file, give a different file
  name each time.  Or, you can put them all into the same file by specifying
  the same file name each time (this makes things easier later on).  This
  saves the messages in the specified files in your home directory on the
  host computer. 
o Quit Pine, then do one of the following depending on the capabilities of 
  your telecomm software.  How you do these things depends on how your 
  telecomm software is designed, so refer to your manual if necessary.
o If your telecomm software lets you scroll backward through a "scrollback
  buffer" (text that has gone off your screen), and if it lets you select
  and print text from the scrollback buffer, enter "cat filename" at the 
  UNIX prompt (but substitute the actual file name you used for 
  "filename").  This will scroll the text in the file down your screen.  
  Scroll backwards to the beginning of the text, select it all, then use 
  your telecomm program's "print selection" command to send the text to 
  your printer.
o If your telecomm program lets you capture text as it scrolls by on your 
  screen and save it to a file on your hard disk, turn on the capture 
  function in your telecomm program.  Issue the "cat filename" command at 
  the UNIX prompt.  When all the text has scrolled by, turn off the capture 
  function.  After you have logged off, use your favorite word processor 
  or text editor to open and print the capture file.
o If your telecomm program allows youi to send text directly to your
  printer as it scrolls by on your screen, turn on the print function in
  your telecomm program.  Issue the "cat filename" command at the UNIX 
  prompt.  When all the text has printed out, turn off the print function.
o Some telecomm programs (like ZTerm for the Macintosh) "print" to your
  screen instead of to your printer when you press "Y" in Pine.  If yours
  does this, you can use a modified version of the previous methods
  which makes it unnecessary to save the message to a file in your home
  directory.  Turn on the capture file function or the print function
  (whichever your telecomm program can do), then press "Y".  Pine will
  "print" the message to your screen, and your telecomm program will send
  the scrolling text to a file on your hard disk or directly to your
  printer.  Or, let the text scroll by, then scroll back to the 
  beginning, select all the text, and send the selection to your printer
  or to a file on your hard disk.
o If all else fails, download the file from the server to your hard drive. 
  Then use your favorite word processor or text editor to open and print the
  capture file. 
 
None of these are as easy as just pressing "Y" while reading a message in
Pine, but they get the job done.

Wait one second!  Were on the Pine development team?

Peter how much did you pay for your copy of Pine???  I'm getting sick of 
all the bitching about Pine going on in this group.  If you don't like it 
switch to something else!  

Personally, there are a few things I'd like to see changed in Pine
however, I think it's the best Unix email interface available!  And it's
free!!  The people at UW have done a great job!  You are appreciated!

Hi!
I come across this problem every so often....
When I go to my .addressbook, I get a message saying:
'addressbook changed by another process'
then it says:
're-syncing addressbook'
 
It will do this for up to a half an hour, till I get aggravated and hang 
up on my server... Hanging up seems to be the only way out....
When I call back, I then have to:

cat .addressbook >> .newaddressbook  
cat .addressbook.lu >> .newaddressbook

Then in my .pinerc file I change the addressbook to .newaddressbook.

Even after doing so, I lose some address's in the process...

Hopefully some one here can help, since after a few letters to them, they 
have never even answered.....

Thanks in advance!
Chris

Is there a workaround for this:

When my sent-mail folder is displayed, I've noticed that some entries
show the "To: " line's contents, and some show the "From: " line's
contents.  The difference between these message (with 100% correlation)
is the very first line, the one labeled "From ".  If the hostname in
"From " matches the current hostname, then the contents of the "To: "
line are shown.  But, if the hostname in "From " is a different,
then the contents of the "From: " line are displayed.  Additionally,
it does NOT say that it's using "From: ", it just shows my name.

I'm using an access provider that has two or three different systems
that I can log into, all sharing my home directory.  When I dial in, I
get whichever machine is the least busy at the moment.  So, when I send
mail, the "From: " & "From " lines will indicate whatever machine I was
on at the time.

I have a similar configuration at work.  But, I use the same
workstation MOST of the time, so I rarely see this problem there.

Lately I've been having trouble reading News from Pine.  The UCSD support 
staff doesn't support Pine (they recommend rn or trn!), so I really hope 
you can give me some advice.

Often, when I first enter a newsgroup, everything is fine: all messages 
appear, and I can read them.  After a short while, though, any subsequent 
messages I attempt to read will be empty; they have a header but no 
message body.  It doesn't matter in what order I read them; all messages 
after a certain point in *time* are empty.  If I exit the group, open 
another, then come back to this one, I can read a few more messages.

Sometimes, even the headers are lost, but in this case it happens to all 
messages past a certain point in the list.  "[ No message text available ]" 
appears in the list in place of date, sender, and subject.  I think this 
happens as soon as I open the group, in contrast to what I described 
above.

Finally, sometimes when I'm reading, I get a "Newsgroup 'whatever' CLOSED 
DUE TO ACCESS ERROR" message.

It looks like Pine is expecting some link to the server to remain open, 
but in fact it's getting closed (and probably quite rudely).  Can anyone 
confirm or deny this?  And what can I do about it?  Does Pine have 
incompatibilities with certain news servers?  And (finally), are there 
public-access news servers somewhere on the Net to which I could point 
Pine, rather than our local news.ucsd.edu?

Many thanks for any help you can provide...

Correction: this has already been done in Pine 3.92, along with
Followup-to support.  Teaches me not to pay attention during meetings.

It is still the case that an email transport can change things so that the
Newsgroups header appears to be false, so you have to watch out for that.

Yes, they did, and I do appreciate it.  I also appreciate gcc.  That doesn't
mean that if it produced incorrect code, I wouldn't complain about it.  Just
because I like the package doesn't mean that I'm not going to submit bug
reports or complain about problems.

The fact that Pine cannot distinguish between news and mail is bad.  I
explicitly make a point of telling people not to use Pine as a news reader
because of it.  I would be very happy if it could be fixed.  And the fact
that I'm unhappy about that part of Pine in no way makes me ungrateful for
the rest of the package.

I would encourage the Pine developers to take a look at Gnus 5 and see how
it handles being both a news and mail reader at the same time.  It does a
much better job.

Yes, I have such a patch. It's very simple:

Beside this patch I have done a couple of other patches to 3.91.
Until now I have been reluctant to publish them, because I have had
the impression the 3.92 would come "soon" and solve all problems :-)

I'll post all my patches as a separate article in this newsgroup.

If you are using PC-PINE, no problem...save and print :-)
If you are running pine on your host (unix) I guess you would have 
to save it remotely and transfer it using kermit or another suitable
program.

I shouldn't have to do that; your reader should indicate that for you
from the headers.

All mailers should indicate that a received email was also posted to
a newsgroup, and if so give the option of replying privately or to the 
newsgroup - 'public' or 'private' mail.

You must have one hell of a large killfile.

Hi !

During the time I have used PINE 3.91 I have made some patches:

  - handle ISO-LATIN-* in header fields (RFC1522).
    This was originally written by Lars Engebretsen <enge@nada.kth.se>.

  - handle ISO-LATIN-* in folder names and adress book entries.
    This depends on the "locale" being correctly specified
    (LC_CTYPE, ...)

  - sending PDF files as "application/pdf"

  - view "application/pgp" (without interpreting the PGP-stuff)
    (this was showed as an "attachment" in 3.91)

  - fix to avoid showing text message from some MAC MUA's
    as attachments (with name="Message Body")

  - changes to compile PINE on Solaris-2 with GCC

I know that 3.92 will fix some of these things, but I wanted to
have it *now*. I post the patches here hoping that they might be
useful to others while we are all waiting for 3.92.

I have used these patches on SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris-2 and IRIX 5.x.
I have heard from others that they have used the patches on
HPUX and Unixware also.

One problem with the current way of building PINE is that there
are 28 different makefiles in the "pine" sub-directory.
Therefore I have only done my changes in the makefiles I was
most interested in (hpp,lnx,sgi,sol,sun,sv4).
On other platforms one has to make the corresponding changes to
the makefile for that platform (should be quite easy with "merge"
or even manually).

The RFC1522 stuff works like this:

======================================================================
Before sending a message, Pine will ask you to confirm that you want the
message to go out.  At that confirmation stage, Pine moves the composer
back to the top so that you can verify that the right people are getting
the message.  After confirmation, the message is sent and copied to the 
FCC folder (if any).
 
In this patched version of 3.91 there are three alteratives when sending:
 
    MIME-Q-P   sends the mail with QP-encoding of the body and
               QP-encoding of the header according to RFC1522.
 
    Yes        sends the mail with 8BIT-encoding of the body and
               an "ad hoc" 7-bit approximation of the header.
               This is intended for sending to non-MIME users
               that still can handle real 8-bit characters (hopefully
               in the right character set).
 
    No         same as before :-)
======================================================================
 
I don't think that my changes has been done "the right way".
The are very ad-hoc, but have worked very well for me several
months. But, of course: USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK :-)

Attached to this article is:

     * the patches to PINE 3.91. Apply them by doing:

              % cd pine3.91
              % patch -p1 ../pine3.91-jh801-patches

     * the patches to compile with GCC on Solaris-2.
       This patch should be made AFTER the jh801-patch.
       Apply by:

              % cd pine3.91
              % patch -p1 ../pine3.91-solaris-gcc-patches

Here's what the Pine technical notes say about it:

         UNIX Pine can print  to  the  standard  UNIX  line
          printers  or  to generic printers attached to ANSI
          terminals using the escape sequences to  turn  the
          printer  on  and  off.   The  user has a choice of
          three printers in the configuration.

          The first setting, attached-to-ansi, makes use  of
          escape sequences on ANSI/VT100 terminals.  It uses
          "<ESC>[5i" to begin directing all output  sent  to
          the terminal to the printer and then "<ESC>[6i" to
          return to normal.  Pine  will  send  these  escape
          sequences  if  the  printer is set to attached-to-ansi.
          This works with most  ANSI/VT100  emulators
          on  Macs and PCs such as kermit, NCSA telnet, Ver-
          saTerm Pro, and WinQVT.  Various  terminal  emula-
          tors implement the print feature differently.  For
          example, NCSA telnet requires "capfile =  PRN"  in
          the  config.tel  file.   Attached-to-ansi printing
          doesn't work at all with the telnet provided  with
          PC-NFS.

I tried the obvious, namely constructing a file that has <esc>[5i at
the beginning, and <esc>[6i at the end, and tried a simple cat command
(from Mac NCSA Telnet, in which Pine printing does work), but the only
effect was to hang my session until I did a terminal reset. So there's
some little subtlety going on there, but I haven't had time to figure it
out yet myself.

I forgot to mention that to build PINE on Solaris-2 with GCC
you have do use the following command:

                  % ./build sol CC=gcc

Hi...

I have one question (and I hope it isn't a dumb one): Is pine (linux
version) capable of using the POP3 protocol for mail retrival ??? If
not, is there perhaps another mail reader that has that capability ???

The reason I am asking this is due to the fact that my provider uses
POP3 for mail transfers, and it works just great with windows, but
when I switch to Linux, I can send mail (via SMTP) but not recieve.

Regards

If you'd like to add the bcc for a single message only (and not 
globally), you could put your cursor anywhere in the header, and then hit 
^R (for 'Rich header'), and the bcc line will appear in the header, to 
fill in.

The AT&F is a command to the modem.
If pine is showing repeated lines/lines are missing etc try
giving these commands to the unix-server before starting pine:

Let's see: I have an RFC 822 compliant mail reader. How is it supposed
to know from RFC 822 headers that what you have just mailed me something
that you also posted to news?

This information is not available to "all mailers" (I assume you mean
mail user agents, since sendmail and smail are not, and should not be,
concerned with who posted what). It is not available to ANY mail agent,
since there is NO defined header which indicates this information.

>You must have one hell of a large killfile.

And you have a mailer which does not comply with RFC 821.

Here's a shell script that will print the contents of a text file when
you're using NCSA Telnet or any terminal program that knows how to handle
VT100/ANSI printer commands.  This came to us from someone at Towson 
State University, who ported it over from a VMS system.  Works well for us.
 
Since NCSA Telnet already lets you select text from scrollback and send 
it to the printer, there's no real need for a "Printer On" command to 
deral with scrolling text.

is it possible to post from pine to the local news spool 
(/var/spool/news, not via NNTP)?  i have pine set up to read news from 
the local spool fine, but posting demands "NNTP Server Must be Defined".

thanks.

I had almost finished my previous mesage when the telnet session crashed,
so this is a bit shorter. 

I have gotten my newsreader to read and post news, but have tried many
variations on *{server_name/smtp}INBOX or *{server_name/smtp}[] 
or  {server_name}INBOX for 
the inbox name with no success. What I am using as server_name is what the
school supplied copy of Eudora has, but still no success. 


The usual error message is something like closed imap connection broken
(server response)

I get connection refused when I try the name of my usual unix machine,
which uses pine with sendmail and /var/spool/mail on an nfs mount.

I don't have any way of entering in my password, and I would hope that the
server would be able to authenticate who I am before releasing my mailbox
to someone.


Any ideas? please? 

If you do mail and post, I won't mind. Probably be easier for me to get
mail, since I would be better off not reading news during finals (hahahaha)

Thanks,
Alice Gifford

IMAP is not within Exchange's scheme of things.  

Exchange bases its operations on storing mail locally (like POP3 
allows).  IMAP requires that mail remains on the server.  On that mail 
server the IMAP client can make their own folders etc but they remain on 
the server.

Exchange creators pride themselves on that universal Inbox, and IMAP just 
does not work with that logic.  Now if they did an IMAP client that added 
other folders besides the user's personal folders (like the shared 
folders on an MS Mail server) then maybe I can see it.  Which reminds me; 
didn't Microsoft make an Exchange client that allowed viewing of shared 
folders on an MS Mail server?

IMAP doesn't have any such requirement.  It can be used to download
mail to a local folder just like POP3 can.  IMAP does allow the option
of keeping mail on the server, which is more problematic with POP3.

Some preliminary investigation has been done by the e-mail group at
UW.  On the surface it looks feasible to write an IMAP <-> MAPI
interface.  We will be investigating it further after the Pine 3.92
release...

I find this a rather intemperate response.  I have no idea whether
the poster was literally "playing a game", or merely chose an unfortunate
idiom.  What I do know is that when I get a short ten-line annoucement
that a colleague has, very properly, sent to 100 recipients, I sure
do not want to have a 100-recipient list of email addresses displayed
to me and stored in my mail archives.

In which case you would seem to think that BCC is functionally
equivalent to CC.
 
I certainly use and recommend the scheme of putting oneself on the
"to" field, and the distribution list on the BCC field.
 
>A quick and dirty workaround to an imaginary problem.
 
In just what way is the problem "imaginary"?
 
It's a real problem to me: I have acres of mail archives filled
with unwanted address lists, prefixing the wanted messages, from
senders who were unaware of the useful advice given above.  Now,
it may well be that this technique can also be misused (mail
bombing) but then, that is quite another matter, and there are
plenty of other ways of misusing email, all of which I certainly
despise.  But let's not despise a useful technique for the sole
reason that it is capable of being misused.

It was an unfortunate idiom because it didn't have a meaning. "Giving

Did I say you had to? Why are you complaining to me rather than to your
colleague? Tell your colleague how to properly distribute a mailing list
and you won't get 100 name address lists in your mail.

If you wish to see an intemperate response, please continue to tell me
what I seem to believe. I believe no such thing. Perhaps you should read
and understand the RFC before you talk about header functionality. CC is
not the same as BCC.

>I certainly use and recommend the scheme of putting oneself on the

You can use what you want. You should stop recommending it, because
there is no guarantee that it will work the way you want it to. Given
that there are mechanisms that will do what you want, recommending this
to others is irresponsible.

And please don't make the claim that something MUST be put on the To:
line, because that is demonstrably false.

I'm sorry. I thought that most computer systems came with an editor that
you could remove unwanted material from files with.

And which "useful advice" are you referring to? The correct way to make
sure that long lists don't show up in mail, or the one where you keep
putting the long lists into your mail and hoping that someone takes them
out for you?

And how do you know they were unaware? How do you know that it wasn't
just a problem of the mailer not removing the list that it doesn't have
to?

>despise.  But let's not despise a useful technique for the sole

Excuse me? Where did I say this? Where did I say I despised anything, or
that I was "despising it" because it could be misused?

No, I will certainly "despise" a technical slution to a problem when it
is not a solution to the problem and there is a simple solution handy.
Nothing in that statement said anything about misuse.

I have never used PINE as a News-reader so I haven't
tried to make the patches work there :-(

Exchange lets you have multiple mail stores...

You can indeed have multiple mail stores, local and remote, and
multiple inboxes, with exchange.  There is indeed a plug-in that lets
you access folders on remote MS-Mail servers.

An IMAP plug-in is theoretically possible.  We just need to find
a programmer who cares about both IMAP and Exchange -- in my
experience, folks who care about one tend not to care about the other.

Amen.  I hate getting email response to a post, reply to it, then check the
newsgroup and find the same reply/followup there.  There are (r)eplies and
(f)ollowups in Usenet culture.  The problem with pine is that it promotes
confounding the two.

Drastic, but perhaps reasonable.

Pine for mail, nn for news, jove or emacs for editing.

My A: I mail them, telling them I have posted the answer to the newsgroup,

have time to get to know any of you, but I INSIST that you immediately
answer my question, but I am not going to stay around long enough to hear
the answer, so please send it to my house!"

Option 1:
Set your "alternate editor" to: /usr/bin/ispell -x

Option 2:
You can recompile applying the following patch written by John R. 
Violette and modified by me to invoke "ispell -x" instead of "ispell" (so 
you don't collect a bunch of backup files all over the place).

Your mailing list has four co-moderators, gets over a hundred messages
a day, and has a high proportion of newbie posters who don't understand
what Pine is telling them when they post private replies?

I'm sure the soc.genealogy.surnames moderators are grateful that you
assign blame squarely where blame is due.

"So fix tin, nn and the trn family!" -- Mark Crispin.

So very interesting.  Some months ago, in an earlier incarnation
of this discussion, that was the "solution" you offered to the
problem of posting private mail: fix every other news software
platform on the planet.  Of course, even if the software
maintainers had agreed immediately to make the required changes,
it would not have affected legacy platforms, where software
packages ten years old and older still run.  But at the time, you
indicated no recognition that there was any such problem with
legacy software -- or, if you did, you apparently did not care
about it.

However, now that you have finally agreed to modify Pine's
behavior to (hopefully) eliminate this problem, suddenly you
demonstrate some comprehension that legacy systems will pose a
problem.  Whoops!  We've still got to worry about those Pine 3.91
users!  So, since the release of 3.92 will apparently not fix the
problem *completely*, would it be fair to say that your demand to
"fix tin, nn and the trn family" was similarly misdirected?

The irony of this, of course, is that we need to worry about
legacy software mainly because 3.91 has been out for over a year,
and has become wildly popular in that time.  Suppose that,
immediately after last year's release, you had admitted that the
Pine philosophy of news presents a practical problem that could be
fixed immediately without impairing Pine's ability to read or post
news, and if you had promptly prepared a bug-fix release.  Had
that happened, we would have much less reason to worry now about
coping with sites at which Pine 3.91 is now installed and may
never be upgraded.  But because you have dragged your collective
heels for sixteen months, we cannot avoid it.

This brings me back to my original, principal complaint about the
state of Pine development.  The real problem is not simply that a
bug was written, or that the Pine designers have a vision for
their software which diverges from that of its users.  The real
problem is that they seem unable to recognize a serious design
flaw when it presents itself, or that they are unwilling to treat
that flaw responsibly and in a prompt manner.  What will happen
when a problem like this happens again?

I'd hate to think what might happen if any of you guys were
doctors and had to deal with a burst appendix.  Why should it be
*your* responsibility to fix it, since the thing shouldn't even
have been there in the first place?

This behavior is neither sanctioned nor discouraged by any
specification, and for many years it has been common practice,
with a meaning orthogonal to that which Pine has imposed.

Pine does not allow the user to make a clear distinction between
the two entities (perhaps because Pine does not make a clear
distinction itself).  Even users who are paying careful attention
to the disposition of their messages are regularly misled by
Pine's diagnostic messages.

Newsgroups which have multiple moderators, at different injection
points, do not have this luxury.  I do not.

>	4) software should anti-false the "Newsgroups:" header.

Only, it seems, because Pine has taken the initiative of forcibly
redefining it for the rest of the world.  I agree that this is a
smart practical decision, but your insistence upon making it
everyone else's *responsibility* is deplorable.

Software should not even ask the user whether they wish to post
something to news that was not news to begin with.  The user is
merely answering a message that was sent to them; if the software
chooses to treat news and mail identically, the software should be
responsible for dispatching the message appropriately, and should
not pass the buck to the user.

How about a .forward with "no.one.home@bogus.address.com".  That should
certainly cause a bounce.

You would need to filter the mail...
Try:	% man procmail		(could compile it yourself)
	% man filter		(comes in ELM package)

Then it's not RFC-822 compliant. It's "RFC-822 + RFC-1036 + house conference

I got a couple of responses to my Question.  The first one I got I tried, and
it worked.

David Drum has a patch and some instructions on how to apply it.  I used
gcc-2.7.1 and, as Dvid points out, with some warnings Pine compiles and
works just fine.

No, letting people see the articles in news is a good way of informing

If they can't read news for that long, what makes you think they are
reading their mail, either? And if the reason they stop reading news is
because they lost interest, why do you think it is proper to dump copies
of your articles into their mail?

So what? References are supposed to expire. If you don't want the
references to dissappear, save a copy. You not saving a copy of what you
want to keep is not a reason to dump copies of news into other people's
mailboxes.

Baloney. It removes coherency by causing people to respond twice to the
same message: once when it shows up in mail and then again when it shows
up in news. 

>Learn to live with it.

Baloney.

David Drum has.  He sent me this short replay.  I tried it with gcc-2.7.1 and

What header?  Not the Newsgroups: line, since many, if not most, news
readers will insert that in an e-mailed reply to a news article (and have
for some time).

Here, let me give you an excerpt from the Gnus 5 info pages:

`gnus-auto-mail-to-author'
     If `ask', you will be prompted for whether you want to send a mail
     copy to the author of the article you are following up.  If
     non-`nil' and not `ask', Gnus will send a mail with a copy of all
     follow-ups to the authors of the articles you follow up.  It's nice
     in one way - you make sure that the person you are responding to
     gets your response.  Other people loathe this method and will hate
     you dearly for it, because it means that they will first get a
     mail, and then have to read the same article later when they read
     the news.  It is `nil' by default.

`gnus-mail-courtesy-message'
     This is a string that will be prepended to all mails that are the
     result of using the variable described above.

If Pine and whatever other mailers or news readers that you use to send mail
replies to newsgroup postings would implement something equivalent to
gnus-mail-courtesy-message, I'd be perfectly happy.  And I will honor all
requests to send a mail copy -- for example, I'm sending an e-mail copy of
this message, since you apparently prefer that.

But there is no header which can communicate this information, and the rest
of the world isn't going to change to fit your concept of how reality should
be.

>> I, for one, will killfile in both mail *and* news those who post and mail

No, only one person so far has been persistantly rude enough to keep sending
me unmarked e-mail copies of followups after I've asked that they stop.  I
see you're trying to be the second, though.

To use pine to run an email list with 100 addresses or more how would you 
keep from sending enormous headers containing the whole list of 
subscribers to everyone on the list? I'm talking about using the 
addressbook's list creation option.

The question is semi-academic...

After Pine 3.87 came version 3.89, then 3.90, followed by 3.91 (the 
current version).

I would strongly urge you to obtain and install 3.91 in preference to 
3.87 as it contains *many* enhancements, particularly in the ability to 
configure it.

As far as I am aware of there are no security problems in any of the 
versions of Pine (that I recall).  However if you are wanting to run it 
under a restricted shell you may find that users can read files (eg, into 
messages being composed) that they would not otherwise be able to.

I think some discussion about the use of Pine within a restricted shell 
environment has occurred in the not too distant past.  If this is 
applicable to you you may be able to find the discussion in the 
"Pine-Info" archives accessible from the Pine Information Centre on the 
World-Wide Web:

No.

At least some of the relevant Microsoft folks seem to be unaware that
IMAP even exists. We've passed on the relevant RFCs. 

If Microsoft starts supporting IMAP, there will be joy throughout the 
land, because this will legitimize the standard and convince people who 
know what they're doing to support IMAP as well.

The best IMAP client I know of for Windows is Simeon, sales@esys.ca,

I've just started using PC-pine for windows.  I have all my folder collections 
on a DEC-station and I am using PC-pine (successfully) to read these folders 
and save incoming messages into them (which I can also do without problems.)  
The trouble I'm having is when I attempt to send or reply to mail.  After 
pressing ctrl-X followed by Y I get the sending mail message but then the 
screen does not clear and the cursor returns to the top of the message.  In 
the configuration under `smtp-server' I just have the name of our mail server 
(which also happens to hold my account) in curly brackets {}, do I need to 
specify sendmail or something?

Any help would be appreciated,

Thanks,  Justin

    Okay, so I'm still struggling with this, but with a little bit more 
information so I've made a small bit of progress.

    Thanks to private e-mail from Mark Crispin, it was pointed out that
this UnixWare version (which I'm running on UnixWare1.1.4) is based on the
SV4 port of Pine.  What that means is that the command it expects to find
to exec the /etc/rimapd, as defined in the c-client Makefile, is
/usr/bin/resh (remote shell, no doubt to differentiate from the restricted
shell which would be rsh), and not /usr/bin/rsh . 

    If I look at /usr/bin on this UnixWare system, I find rsh, which 
indeed is the remote shell, but no resh.

    For the sake of a UnixWare port, or at least definitions which would 
point in such a direction, I ask, does the standard UW1.x consist of 
/usr/bin/rsh but no /usr/bin/resh for the remote shell?
    Is there any difference in UW2.x , or is /usr/bin/rsh still what a 
SysVR4 system would know as /usr/bin/resh?

    Okay.  Now the fun began.  So, I thought, aha, well, let's make a 
/usr/bin/resh which Pine expects to be able to execute, which I did by 
linking /usr/bin/rsh to it.  One slight drawback -- if rsh is called by 
any other name, that is taken as a host for the argument to rlogin.  So I 
got messages to the effect that resh was an unknown host.

    The True Hacker does not give up, but says aha -- so I alias the host 
called resh to be our IMAP server.  Okay, all well and good, and the 
command ``/usr/bin/resh'' would log one into the IMAP server.  
Unfortunately, the command ``/usr/bin/resh IMAPSERVER exec /etc/rimapd'' 
was not successful.  Sigh.

    The True Hacker does not give up.  I am not The True Hacker.  I chose 
to turn my attention to other more rewarding things, and planned to attack 
the problem at the source (code).

    When I got my courage up again, I decided to see if I might be able 
to compile Pine with a change to the definition of RSH so it would try to 
execute /usr/bin/rsh instead.  This is not so easy.  The UnixWear box I'm 
trying to get this to work on has no compiler, and a limited amount of 
space like everything else around here.  So, I am looking at the 
following options:

1)  Begging and pleading for someone with a compiler for UnixWare1.1.4 
(or compatible) to recompile Pine with the noted change to point Pine in 
the right direction to find /usr/bin/rsh .  If any other changes are 
needed, report them to the Pine Team for possible inclusion as a UW1 port 
-- if UW2 is the same and has no resh, then perhaps there can be a UW2 
port as well if it is different from UnixWare1.x .  I have no chance of 
getting a compiler here, so I have no way to do this myself.

2) Building gcc on another system as a cross-compiler and using that to
compile Pine for i386-sysv4 UnixWare.  This is the approach I've decided
to try just for laughs and see how it works.  Of course, my resources here
are limited and I've spent the weekend doing this, which is more time than
I promised myself I'd put into it.  Kinda hard to install a cross-compiler
and supporting utilities when you don't have root access, but The True
Hacker is not discouraged by such petty limitations.  Nor is The True
Hacker put off by certain header files which are called for by Pine but
which I haven't seen on the UnixWhereAreThey box.  I am not The True
Hacker.  But at least I gain experience and understanding.  Well,
experience. 

3)  Asking someone to put me out of my misery.  If you're in the Brno 
area, you can find me at Mendel University, if I'm not walking downtown 
muttering about includes.  But only until Wednesday, which is when I hope 
to have this problem solved, for I'll go on my way and let them hack the 
sendmail.cf rather than migrate to a client-server model.

4) Using a friendly binary file editor to change the resh references,
which can be seen by running ``strings'' on the Pine binary and grepping
(see http://www.vszbr.cz/~guest/images/grep.gif) for ``resh'' on the
output of that, into references to /usr/bin/rsh and rsh and Ed Grshko.  I
don't really know what I'm doing here, nor do I know if it's the correct
approach, but it's less painful than option 2, and while I can't tell if
it works until Monday when I have access to the machines of interest, the
resulting binary doesn't quite exactly bomb immediately just yet as far as
I can tell, I think, maybe. 

5) Skip the problem, let someone else deal with it, open a fine Czech beer
or three, turn up the heat, play some Jungle and Breakbeat loud, and enjoy
the weekend. 


    As always, I would be grateful for any help someone can offer, advice 
about what you've done in similar situations, or consolation.


Many thanks...

I don't know if you are the group I should be asking this question of, 
but here it goes.

I have an account at the Univ of New Mexico. I can access it via local 
telephones from home or directly at school. My question is, when I go on 
vacation, is it necessary for me to call long-distance to these local 
numbers in order to gain access or is there some way to make use of local 
calls around the country to access it? For instance if I am in San 
Francisco is there some local number (say for SFSU) whereI could call and 
from there login to my accoutn in New Meixco?  This seems familiar but I 
don't know the validity or method by which I do this. Assuming I can find 
the local dial-in numbers where-ever I am, how do I get to my account?

Thanks Steve

Hi, all!

Is it possible to get the SMTP error message if the session fails?
Now one just gets a 'Be-e-e-e-p' and doesn't know, what was a problem. 
If Pine could show SMTP error message, it would help a lot in tracing 
down a problem.

Do I miss something or is it not possible in 3.91? Then may be include 
in 3.92?

BTW I don't mean debug file. It is too late :-) (first I have the 
problem and then start Pine with -d and it runs O.K)

thanks for info

Yes,
I'd like to second this request...we had a bunch of calls from people
complaining that "pc-pine hangs" - turns out they mistyped an address.

    Some communications programs you run on your notebook/PC have a 
screen capture facility, so that what you read is also captured in a 
local file.  You can then print that.  It saves having to do a separate 
file transfer from a remote host.  I use ProComm Plus v2/DOS, and it has 
that capability.  I use it from time to time.  Check out your comm 
software documentation for something like "screen capture" or "log file."

Huh?  Email is certainly NOT Usenet.  Email and Usenet are carried over the

It also contains a certain enhancement that a lot of people view
as a very serious design flaw, which the poster might wish to take
into account.

There were some problems just like this with earlier versions of pine.
What version are you using?  If you're using 3.91 and seeing this problem,
I'd very much like to understand why.  If you're using 3.90, upgrade to
3.91.  When it happens and you hang up, does it happen again when you log
back in (without doing the cat..cat thing)?  If so, stop at that point and
send your .addressbook and .addressbook.lu to pine@cac.washington.edu as
attachments.  Describe what can be done to make the problem happen for
you.

And by the way, cat'ing the .addressbook and .addressbook.lu files
together into the same file is guaranteed to cause some weirdness.  Hard
to believe it fixes anything.

Hello There,


Is there is any way in Pine by which we can set up the system.so that the 
mail messages which are already read from INBOX folder move to some other 
folder automatically. Like in VMS mail systems.whenever you read any mail 
message from NEWMAIL folder it automatically moves into MAIL folder 
if you don't specify any folder where it has to be moved. 

Is there is something has to be set up in UNIX mails (Some filters or 
some extra process to be run ) so that the new mails which are read are 
moved automatically to some folder (say read-mail folder)


I will summarize.

Thanks and regards

Samir

1. In the system aliases file, have your admin create the following
entries:

listname: :include:/some/file/you/can/edit
owner-listname: your@address
listname-request: your@address

2. In the file /some/file/you/can/edit, put all the addresses you want
on your list.

3. Send your mail to listname.

I have found that certain transport agents have a limitation on the 
number of addresses that can be allocated to a specific alias.  What I 
have done in the past to work around this problem is to create an alias 
that contains aother aliases in it:

much like this:

denver:	jpublic@den.edu, qpublic@den.edu, simth@den.edu
sanfran: qwerty@sf.edu, poiuyt@sf.edu

all: denver, sanfran

Assume that the lists are too long for the transport agent ... the alias 
"all" avoids the problem by creating a manageable list of other aliases.  
Address resolution still occurs and the "To:" field contains only the 
address "all" ....  Of course these aliases are created behind PINE in 
the o/s' level of the mail program.  If you do not have access to this 
level, you would have to discuss it with your system administrator.

Yes, you can do this within Pine.  In fact if you look in the Setup 
Configuration screen (S then C from the Main Menu of Pine 3.91) it is 
pretty obvious which settings affect this (and there is also built-in 
help too!)...

1.  Set up a folder name for the "read-message-folder" value.

When you quit Pine it will then ask you if you want read messages moving 
into this folder.  If you just want it to do the move without asking you 
look further down the list of settings and...

2.  Select the "auto-move-read-msgs" feature.

No, you don't need to run any extra filters or anything: Pine is quite 
capable of refiling mail messages you have read to a different folder.

Where some people often fall down is expecting Pine to be able to file 
new messages *as they arrive* into different folders.  This it cannot do: 
Pine is a mail reader for reading messages *after* they have been 
delivered into folders.  The mail delivery software (usually "sendmail" 
on UNIX systems) must instead be persuaded to deliver arriving messages 
into appropriate folders.  This is where filters, etc, are needed.

I use PINE to read USENET newsgroups and often want to 'reply' (to the 
original poster) and 'followup' (to the newsgroup).  I've been doing this 
by highlighting the email address, selecting 'followup to newsgroup' and 
putting the email address in the BCC line (so it shows up correctly in 
the USENET news listing).

is there any easier way to do this in PINE?

Hmm... have you tried setting it to 'localhost' and seeing what that 
does?  I've no idea if it will work, but it might be worth a try.

I too would recommend searching the newsgroup archives.

The only security issue mention of which I seem to recall seeing is
system(3) calls in which the called utilities lack full pathnames,
making the caller vulnerable to trojan horse utilities.  Of course, pine
would not be the only potential victim of such trojans.

This is not limited to v3.87.

   I have a quick questions about Pine, if somewhat could answer for me 
I'd be very grateful:

   Is it possible to instruct PC-PINE or (esp.) UNIX-PINE *not* to give up
the mailbox lock when another application asks for it?  I use this program
that checks every minute and a half to see if I have mail, and when it does
so, it makes my PINE session read-only.  Pine therefore can't save flags
(deleted, important, answered, etc.).  Although I can usually remember to
close it when I am using my PC, it is most annoying when I use UNIX-PINE
remotely and the program (on my PC) rudely glabs the key. 

    If you reply after noon on Wednesday (est), if you could e-mail me the
response at ed@jhu.edu, I'd appreciate it, because I leave for break at 1pm
Wednesday (est) not to return until Jan 18 by which time I think my newsfeed
will no longer contain the response, by then a month-old. 

Thanks again!!!
          - Edward

Subject: runaway pine processes eat cpu
Date: 19 Dec 1995 11:47:39 GMT
Message-Id: <4b68or$5e@lyra.csx.cam.ac.uk>

We have occasional problems with pine 3.89 on IRIX 5.2 where users'
PCs etc hang while in a pine session. Later, the sysadmin notices
pine processes consuming vast amounts of cpu. From the users'
points of view there are no errors and when they login again
they innocently start a new pine process. It is possible this
is not a pine-specific problem as occasionally other programs produce
runaway processes. I note that we had to alter two routines when
compiling pine on this system viz in ttyin and ttyout termname was
not used but was replaced by mytermname to avoid a clash. 
I previously had pine (3.87?) installed on a SunOS 4 machine without
noticing this problem. Again, this may be fortuitous. I have a suspicion
that the problem we are seeing now is very much associated with terminal
input.  Has anyone any idea what to do about this, including
possibly a suitable process-killing daemon or else code alterations?

Thank you!

another address, can one create a ".retrun-to-sender" file to auto-return
unwanted e-mail from a specific e-mail addressee?

  How about importing the plain text file directly into your e-mail body? 
  To do so, press ^R when you're composing an e-mail while the cursor is
in the body of the message (not in any of the header fields). Then enter
the name of the plain text file you want to import.

Setup the following:

auto-move-read-messages

This should help you

Please: I have read the man, tried the ?, and the snwer lies not therein.

The version of pine I am using does not tell one how to select a block
of text.  the oly command for deleting texct is ^k whoch works on one
line at a time.  Very slow.  Other versions have marking and selecting
abilities.  I suspect my version has the abilaity, but not the
instructions.

What is the standard command for marking text for deletion.since this is
such an elementary [not to menetion embarrassingly stupid] question,
email replies would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Yours,

I have seen a large number of questions having to do with the routing of

Sure thing... try upgrading to the current version of Pine!

We, too, had the occasional problem with runaway Pine 3.89 sessions.  The 
problem, as far as I recall, was a small bug in the C-client library of 
routines (the problem also affected imapd's as well I think).

However, after Piune 3.89 came 3.90, followed by the current 3.91.  
Indeed, this has been around for a _long_ time now (a year or so) and is 
well worth the upgrade.

Cheers,

Go up into the header area with the arrow keys, do a ctrl-R (for
"rich header" or some such) and the Bcc: willappear.  Just fill in
the address you want the blind carbon copy to go to on that line.

Subject: Pine 3.91 + Check Quotas + Digital Unix
Date: 20 Dec 1995 05:37:45 GMT
Message-Id: <4b87f9$fu0@cmcl2.NYU.EDU>

We are running Pine 3.91, compiled to check quotas, and compiled
separately on our Ultrix and OSF/1 (Digital Unix) systems.  (That is, 
we recompiled it separately for Digital Unix rather than use DEC's tool 
to mutate an Ultrix binary into an OSF/1 binary.) 

Pine is configured (in pine.conf.fixed) to automatically move read mail
from the /usr/spool/mail/USERNAME file to the user's "saved-messages"
folder when the user exits.

When we first deployed the 3.91 release, we tested how it behaved under
an out-of-space condition in the user's $HOME/mail directory.  As
expected, we found that it did not remove the mail from the INBOX when
the user had insufficient space on the device that held the 
"saved-messages" folder.  That is, the "check quota" mechanism worked
perfectly.

Since that initial series of tests, however, we have migrated a couple
of our systems from Ultrix to Digital Unix, with $HOME directories
living on DEC's advfs partitions rather than ufs.  We have found that 
Pine does not appear to properly check the disk quota when the user's 
home directory is in an advfs (Digital's Advanced Filesystem) 
partition.  The results appear to be as follows:

	* quit Pine, and attempt to move read mail to "saved-messages"
	* check quota on $HOME/mail device, but (apparently) ignore 
	  the results
	* delete mail from INBOX
	* try to write to "saved-messages"
	* if user is at or above quota on $HOME/mail device, vaporize 
	  mail

Has anyone seen this in action?  Is there some additional information I 
could provide that would make this report more clear?  I see the
following in pine/osdep:

	diskquot      diskquot.hpp  diskquot.ptx  diskquot.sun
	diskquot.a32  diskquot.non  diskquot.sgi  diskquot.sv4

None appears to be relevant to Digital's advfs, though.  Or is there
some other approach we might take?

Happy holidays from snowy New York, with all thanks in advance!

Nice attempt, but the same happens in pine 3.91 and also in a lot of X11 programs.
The problem is a select call returning data present in a socket, and the following 
read call returning 0 bytes read and no error. The program continues ad libitum 
in this loop.

441 is a "posting-failed"-message from the server. It turned out to
be a server-problem.

It was a nicer try than you seem to think... although we were getting 3 
or 4 runaway Pine 3.89 processes a week, I don't think we've seen a 
single Pine 3.91 runaway over the year or so we've had it.  Could be 
difference in platforms, could just be luck?

Does anyone have a fix for this problem?  We have upgraded to PINE 3.91 
from 3.89 on one system and 3.88 on another.  The Solaris is the one 
exhibiting this SAME problem.  Unfortunately, it shoots our load average 
up and then the system refuses access to PoP mailers. Argh. BIG headaches. 
Can anyone help me or suggest something?

I have just picked up Pine 3.89 and have it running on the AIX4.1
system at work. I see references here for a 3.91 version and am
curious where I can go to pick up the patch, or even better if
the appropriate patches can be emailed to me.

TIA

The server, gti.net, uses 3.90, but getting them to upgrade would 
probably be next to impossible, since they didn't even answer my mail 
directly to them about this problem.... in other words, I don't think 
they care... but, it can't hurt to ask (I hope). 
 Yes, it does do it after I call back, and just keeps doing the same thing
 over and over....

*********
It does work to a point, but I do have to fix it a bit afterwards. Now, I 
just have backups of the .add and the .add.lu, so when it occurs, I just 
delete it and put the backup in....

SYSV remote shell used to be called remsh NOT resh. I guess that has been
Berkleyized to rsh. I wonder what happened to SV restricted shell (rsh)?

I asked this before and nobody responded. I'm using pine on an RS/6000.
When I display a list of articles in a newsgroup, the dates shown are
not correctly sorted. There will be long runs of, say, Dec 15, then
a Dec 3, then more Dec 15's... Has anyone else seen this on other
platforms?

I am running Pine 3.91 on my ULTRIX account and have never had any 
problems with it.  Until now.
  For some reason, it will not permanently add some newgroups nor 
permanently delete others.  Anyone have any ideas on this?  Thanks...

They may be sorted by arrival instead of date. You should be able to change
this in the config screens. (Sort-Key)

Sounds good but could you be a little more specific? What do

file full of addresses, but I'm not clear where to go from there.

Hello.

We believe that this problem is fixed in Pine 3.92.

For the technically inclined:

This problem occurs only on UNIX variants that return "partial success"
from write() and writev() when a disk-full or quota-exceeded error is
encountered.  Digital Unix (OSF/1) and many System V systems are such
variants.

The mailbox writing code was written on (and originally ported to) UNIX
variants (BSD) that guarantee that write() and writev() would only return
partial success "when using non-blocking I/O on objects...that are subject
to flow control", and in particular return an ENOSPC or EDQUOT error for
disk-full or quota-exceeded conditions and leave the file pointer
unchanged.

The first System V port was done by someone who did not catch the
difference in write() semantics, and thus we weren't aware of the problem
until last May.  Thus, the fix did not make it into Pine 3.91, which had
been released half a year earlier.

The fix is that all write() and writev() calls are coerced through an
emulator (safe_write() and safe_writev()) which ensures the BSD semantics
of "win" or "lose" with no "win but it hurts"...  ;-)

So? There will always be rude people who think newsgroups were created
as their personal answer source, who can't imagine that anyone else
might be interested in knowing the answer to the question they asked, or
that might have a better answer or a correction to an answer that is
wrong.

That doesn't make dumping duplicate copies of articles into people's
mailboxes because you are too lazy to notice that they weren't asked for
correct behaviour.

I suppose you can show me where I asked YOU to send ME copies of
everything you post? No? Then why are you doing it?

>Consider that Pine integrates mail and news; that Netscape does to.

No, they have made an attempt at doing it, and they don't have the
information they need to do it right.

>If mail-and-post isn't desirable behaviour, why are so many people
>adopting it? 

Because they are sheep? Because they think that, since their spiffy
newsreader allows them to do it, it must be a spiffy thing to do? Or 
maybe they are just obnoxious twits who think they have the right to
harass people by email.

So sending people a copy of one small piece of a thread is a solution?
No, that's just plain stupid.

Yep, great.

That is your problem. Get a bigger spool. Get an agent that scans for
news that you are interested in. 

I really don't care if you miss articles you are interested in, and
SENDING ME A COPY OF YOUR ARTICLES isn't going to solve your problem.

>If they respond by mail-and-post, I am much more likely to reply

You can't "continue the thread" by replying to mail. There isn't
sufficient information in a mail header to allow that.

Mail-and-post don't combat anything. Mail-and-post is an abuse,
especially when you have been told to stop.

Ok, if they won't bother reading news, then so what if they miss it?
That's part of life. Tough nooggies. That is their choice.

>Home users may only access at weekends. 

So access more often. Christ almighty, people who CHOOSE not to read
news shouldn't be the impetus behind how news is run.

>With short spool settings, the
>responses to their posted articles have already expired. 

Yes. So? If they cared about replies, they would read more often.

>With mail-and-post, they're still in the loop.

In a loop that they may not want to be in. And, in your example, a loop
they have chosen not to be in. So, what you are saying is, "God damn it,
you WILL see my reply even if you don't want to, because I think my
reply is SO damned important I will send it to you personally, even when
you tell me not to."

So you read news to see the responses.

Right.

You sending me a copy of your crap does nothing to solve your spool
problems. Why do you think it does? Are you going to ask me to return
copies of something you posted to you when they expire? Why not just
keep your own copies of what you post, instead of demanding that I keep
them for you?

So what? It is easier for a naive user to just not log in. Is that the

But the single articles showing up in my mailbox from you are supposed
to make sense. Right.

It is in a sorry state when people post sentences like that. 

>I bow to your obviously intelligent and reasoned arguments.

When you present something that shows what mail-and-post is proper
behaviour, you have some right to make that statement. When you
understand how news and mail works a little better, you can make that
statement. When you think about the problems of combined news and mail a
little more, you can make that statement. Until then, you are, as you
yourself put it, "ho hum".

Now, stop sending me copies of your articles by mail. Get a mailer that
understands fatal response codes from the receiver.

Please read RFC 822 and show me where it defines the Path header. Please
explain why an RFC-822 compliant mail agent is going to know about
headers that are not defined for mail.

Now please explain why, out of all of the pieces of crap people have
thought it necessary to dump into my mailbox while they were posting,
not a single one of them has had a Path header. 

No, "existence of Path" is not the answer, and if you thought about it
for even half a second, you would know that.

"User mail agents" don't know whether what they are seeing has been
mailed or not. They can't possibly know, because there is no header
which tells them that.

Do you get particular delight out of abusing the technical terms like
you do?

Yes. It is so easy. What, exactly, does "Posted-To:" mean? When is it
used? How is it used by a mail agent when creating a reply? What other
headers need to be changed or created to allow "Posted-To:" to work?
How does the agent keep track of whether a filed copy of something is mail
or news or both? Have you bothered to think about any of this?  No,
apparently not.

I have.  That is why I have a proposed RFC already written.
But it isn't an RFC yet, and you are speaking in the present tense.
That means you think there is an answer NOW. Tell us all what the answer
NOW is. Not what you think should be created. 

Until you can exhibit your present-day solution to support your
present-day claims, ho-hum yourself.

By the way, get a mailer that understands permanent failure result codes
in SMTP.

If you do that, then users won't be able to post followups when they are
reading news.

The correct action is to anti-false the Newsgroups: header, which has been
done in Pine 3.92.

As I said, I would alter PINE to ignore Newsgroups: lines in mail messages.
Not in news messages.
While it's not possible to detect if a message received in Email was also
posted to a Usenet newsgroup, it's fairly simple for PINE to internally know
if the user is reading a mail folder or a newsgroup.

I have tried to reproduce the problem using Pine 3.91. I can't. 

1. I Post using Tin.
2. A colleague replies to the posting and the reply gets sent to me.
3. I reply to this email message using Pine 3.91.
4. The email reply goes to the person in 2.
5. Nothing gets posted to the newsgroup.

Am I missing something in this discussion?  Or are you all talking about 
a different scenario?

*Ack*

News vs email confusion.

The poster wants pine to ignore the Newsgroups header in email.

Not in News.

No, but my WinBiff program will at least get the IMAP headers;
it works just fine under Win95.

Hello,

Does anyone know if it is possible to configure pine in such a way 
that I can receive a "confirmation of delivery" for the mail I send 
out? The mailer I used previously on CMS did this, and I often found 
it useful to know that my e-mail had arrived at its destination.

Any experiences with this or ideas that are worth trying?

Thanks!

Yes, you're right...I said that backwards from what I was thinking.  Sorry
about that.

> 1] Use Pine as a news reader 

I'm sorry to post this to the Pine newsgroup, but news and news readers are
a specialty of mine.  I support them, maintain them, document them, and use
them extensively.  I've tried a huge variety of news readers, from the
standard rn/trn/strn to tin, nn, Netscape, News Watcher, NewsGrazer, and a
half-dozen other news readers including Pine.

Pine is quite literally one of the worst news readers I have ever seen.

This is only partially because of the fact that it doesn't understand the
difference between mail and news.  In terms of screen organization, user
interface, efficiency, and features, Pine is one of the last in every
respect.  There is no way I would ever recommend the program as a news
reader.  The only time when I can possibly think of someone wanting to use
it as a news reader is if they want an integrated interface to mail and news
and are already familiar with Pine.

And this behavior is *incorrect*.  It means that the recipient of the e-mail
reply may not know what newsgroups the message originated from; that's a
problem that I have personally had, since I'm active in quite a number of
newsgroups on different subjects, and replies with subjects like "Help" that
don't quote anything (common from AOL users, for one) often make it very
hard to figure out what the person was referring to.  Having the Newsgroups:
header helps considerably.

The Newsgroups: header does not mean what Pine thinks it means.  This is a
design flaw.

Yes.  And as you state yourself, that's never going to happen.

First off it's "Blind carbon copy".  this means that the recipient 
won't know someone else got a copy.  There are two ways to do it:

when composing a message, press ^R for rich headers, then go to the Bcc: 
field

or go to Setup and Configure your default headers to include Bcc:

Does IMAP or related software support any kind of certified mail -- ie., 
confirmation that mail has been delivered or handled by the intended

Are you sending email or playing a game? What "game" is being given
away? 

Are you saying that the mail system is failing to keep the addresses in
a BCC list a secret from other members of the BCC list?  Well, yes,
there is no requirement for this secret to be kept. Mail systems are
free to put the entire list of BCC addresses in each copy sent to a BCC
list member. Even in mail which has a To: header, the BCC recipients may
find the list of other BCC recipients.

A quick and dirty workaround to an imaginary problem. Why not just do it
the right way and not worry about "secrets" and "games" and trying to
fool mail systems?

People make the following requests on Usenet (Q), and here is my
raction (A).

Q: Please email me your reply, as I don't read this newsgroup.
A: What an arrogant jerk!

Q: Please send replies by email, and I will post a summary.
A: Smart person!  I will be glad to cooperate.

Q: Please email me a copy of any postings, my News access isn't reliable.
A: Be glad to oblige.

Only in the third case would I also send by email a copy of a
posting, and only because the recipient requested it, and only after
making sure I added a comment to prevent confusion, e.g.:

     Hi, in response to your request, here's an email copy of something
     I just posted to Usnet.

If you are claiming that it's a good thing to send by email an
identical copy of every posting you make, the fact that some people
make certain rquests as listed above does not seem to support your
claim.

People often adopt many behaviors because they like doing certain
things to others which they do not necessarily want to have done to
themselves.  I confess I am tempted to harrass you to death by sending
you in email an exact copy of every posting I ever make to Usenet, but
that doesn't mean that I want you to do this to me (or even that I
would actually do it to you).

Is there any way to automatically use the REPLY-TO rather than the FROM 
if there is a REPLY-TO?

PINE asks you if you want to use it, but I'd rather it do this 
automatically rather than asking, since I can't imagine ever NOT wanting 
to use the reply-to rather than the from if the person put a reply-to.


thanks

Is it possible to change the indent prefix from the '>' default. I use
Pine 3.91 for mail as well as news, and when I try to post a reply
shorter than the original, I get a posting error.

The workaround I have is to manually change the '>' to something different,
and the posting goes thru properly. Can this be done automatically without 
changing the source ?

Is there any way to read and manage mail on two different accounts, on two

I was thinking about something similar to reading News...

    I have never heard that it can be done automatically in Pine just by 
a configuration option.  Apparently you have to modify the source code to 
Pine itself and recompile it, and to do that you have to have some 
competence in programming.  Of course, you can always change it by hand 
for each individual message.  For a while I posted to a foreign language 
(i.e., non-English) group, and I had to do just that.

    Rather than specify the whole list in the To: field, put it in the 
Bcc: field.  Then each recipient will only see his/her address in the 
header.  In this case, you must put _something_ in the To: header, so 
just put yourself there.  Be aware that some mail transport agents choke 
on address lists which are larger than a certain size (Pine is a mail 
_user_ agent), so sending out a single piece of mail to gargantuan 
numbers of recipients can be a dicey proposition on some host systems.  
This isn't Pine's fault.

A friend of mine is using Pine as a newsreader as well as for mail. 
Whenever she attempts to post a message to a newsgroup she gets `error

Can anyone here interpret this message and suggest a solution.

/usr/bin/rsh is the remote shell

    You can go into Setup and Config from the Main Menu (assuming you are 
using Pine 3.91) and add a customized header, Return-receipt-to: 
your-address .  However, this is no guarantee that you will in fact get a 
receipt when the mail gets there, as not all receiving systems honor the 
request and there is no Internet-wide requirement that they do so.  Some 
do, some don't.  (Your experience on CMS was probably solely within the 
IBM internal world, which honors it in its own way and is not an Internet 
standard.  Various proprietary mail schemes do things like this.)

    This capability already exists, at least in Pine 3.91.  In the 
addressbook, you can edit an entry and specify what folder is to receive 
a copy of the outgoing mail addressed with that nickname.  (However, I'm 
not sure what happens if you address a piece of mail with multiple 
nicknames with different Fcc's specified in the addressbook.  I've never 
tried it.)

[ lots of stuff snipped ]

we also have a problem with runaway pines eating tons of cpu cycles. 
(we're using pine 3.91 on aix 3.2.5.  as an aside, we didn't have the
problem with pine 3.89.)

to minimize the effects of this, i run a script every 15 minutes that sees
how much cpu time each pine session has used.  if it's over 2:00 minutes,
the session gets killed.  it's a crude solution, but it works. 

happy holidays!

Use procmail, or any one of the other mail filtering methods.  Since this
is getting posted to the ELM group, ELM's "filter" program would also work.

Using this, select messages from the unwanted sender and make it run a
program to mail back a "go away" message.

Hugh.

If the best is a crude approximation, then how do you claim that it is
"done right"?

I have yet to see any definition for this term "anti-false", so I guess
you can claim it works right no matter what it does.

That is why, of course, the version number is incrementing the minor
number by one instead of incrementing the major number.

I think not.  My site had the same experience with Unix Pine.  Under 3.89
I would see seven to ten looping Pine processes per day (on a system where
around 3,000 Pine sessions are started per day).  In the past year we've
had 3.91 I can only recall isolated cases where Pine hung, and all were
due to pretty obvious things (e.g., IMAP server or home directory
fileserver going down). 

The problem we're still waiting for (I understand this is already fixed 
in current UW internal versions of Pine 3.92) is where, under AIX (and a 
few other OSs) some unclean disconnections result in a zero-length 
~/.pine-interrupted-mail file (which can in turn result in 
~/.pine-interrupted-mail-lock* files).

A zero-length file is a legal Berkeley ("From "-delimited) mailbox, and
the ~/.pine-interrupted-mail file is stored in that format.  However, Pine
warns the user upon each compose that there is interrupted mail, and then 
if the user agrees to continue it, Pine starts to spit out error 
messages.  In some cases it can go into a loop and hang or dump core.

On my machines, if I look at the hardware error logs (which under AIX
includes some firmware and kernel errors as well), any errors which I
might find interesting are drowned out by the logs of fifty or more Pine
coredumps every day. 

*Very* much looking forward to 3.92 here. :)

    The purpose for putting _something_ in the To: field is purely 
functional.  Some people have had the experience that if they leave To: 
blank and use a group of addresses in Bcc:, then somewhere along the line 
all the Bcc: addressees get listed in an Apparently-to: manufactured

making some kind of entry, such as yourself, in the To: field seems to be 
a quick and dirty workaround.

1. If you read the specifications for the BCC header, you will note that
there is no guarantee that each user in the BCC list will see only his
own address there. BCC is meant to be kept secret from the primary and
secondary addressees, but not from other BCC recipients.

2. No, you do not need to put a To: header in mail that contains a BCC.
There is no reason to send it to yourself.

A better way of running an email list is to create an alias that has
all the names, in a file which the list manager can edit. Then you
simply send the mail to that alias. Nobody sees anyone else's address,
all they see is the list address.

Notice at posting #14 which is from me does not give my name but only
<To: Multiple recip> while the other postings (#15 and #16 for example)
give the name of the person posting. I have tried asking
listserve@american.edu but they say they have no idea why this is happening.
I hope you can advise me as to rectify this.  Thank you

I've got a Linux system running Pine...  When users try to ^T to spellcheck
their message, /usr/bin/spell <which is ISpell> runs and prints out an
error message...  Pine isn't giving it the parameters it is expecting.  I tried
to recompile Pine but I get bazillions of errors doing so.  I checked it on 
another Linux system, and had the same problem there.  Any suggestions? 
Please reply via email.
Thanks.

Hello.  I am in need of a PINE binary for AT&T Unix 3.2.2.  I have the
source, but no development system on that particular platform.

Does anyone know where I can get such a binary?

I have been trying to run the SCO UNIX binary on this machine, but it 
doesn't look like it is going to work.

Thanks in advance!

How would they have posted the request if they had no access? I suppose they
could have asked a friend to post, but then the address would have to be
entered by hand, and in that case I guess it's reasonable. Still, usually
questions that are appropriate to a newsgroup would have answers from which
other people reading the newsgroup would benefit.

    If you have a World Wide Web browser, look at my home page and follow 
the link to Nancy McGough's pages.  She has useful material there on 
filtering incoming mail into different folders.  procmail and filter 
(from elm) are probably the most common programs used on Unix.

Why not call it PINE 4.0, then? I've seen the list of features being
added into the new version; with that and the new anti-falsing code,
people really should upgrade from 3.91 and below to this new version.
If you call it 3.92, people may think it's only a minor upgrade, and
not bother.

I'm not sure this is strictly accurate. The Exchange model appears to allow
not only alternative transport providers, but also an alternative message store
provider, and indeed an alternative address book provider. I would have thought
that the universal Inbox could still be used for incoming messages, and then an
IMAP store provider could allow access to a central store for storage. This is
presumably analagous to the difference between using local folders and using 
an Exchange server (whenever!).

Lots of coding of course......

You can follow most newsgroups by mail if there is a crosslink established
by the moderator as is the case with the Pine-list. Ofcourse you must
subscribe by some procedure, but that's only once. We have an UUCP-account
for mail and no extra provisions for news. For a small company like ours
this is quite usefull.

Agreed ! One's problems are seldom unique, so we can 'share' knowledge.

I use Pine now for some time on our own system, that poll's our Internet 
provider several times a day. In addition I have a login account on their 
machine, that I mainly use for WWW-surfing. In addition there is Pine 
available on that machine, and there I can use Pine to read news 
directly. There are other solutions as well (eg. Trumpet Newsreader), but 
this is what I do sometimes.

Therefore I feel it is handy to ask for reply by mail if I do not follow a 
group very frequently. My opinion is that the effort to send a copy by mail 
would not be that much asked !

For good order: my comment was intended to explain, not to be crude.

Because 3.92 does not do the crude approximation based on where the
message *may* be stored.  3.92 does a better analysis of the header.

Anti-falsing refers to the rejection of a Newsgroups: header line in a
message header if the header does not otherwise conform to a standard of a
message that has been posted.  The presence of a "Path:" header is part of
the test, but not the only test.

Anti-falsing has been designed so that it errs on the side of assuming
that a message has *not* been posted (that is, that the Newsgroups: header
line is bogus).  It should never err and assume that a message was posted
when it was not.

At the same time, it preserves mail/news integration, including support of
messages that are both posted and mailed (and recognition of such).

There are several important functionalities which have been declared for
the first Pine 4, which 3.92 does not have.  Some of these, such as a
hierarchical folder browser, require IMAP4 support which won't be in 3.92
but which I expect will be in the next one after that (the IMAP4 code is
done, but there are a lot of interface changes that need to be in Pine).

Or maybe you should stop telling your program to misinterpret a header
that is undefined in email?

Actually, I've seen both (on different SVR3.2 ports).

As I recall, the 'r' commands came from BSD, and the new name was created
by the SysV people just to keep it from colliding with the restricted
shell (now /usr/lib/rsh).

Then kindly explain the existance of RFC822 and RFC1036. 

Tell me why smail cannot handle my Usenet feed. 

Tell me why inews fails to pass my email.

Tell me if you have ever administered a system dealing with both email
and Usenet.

Pine does.

Any integrated mail agent/newsreader ought to.

Usenet and email are converging.

    It may not be necessary to recompile Pine, *IF* you are using Unix 
Pine.  I use the shell script below to change the '>' characters to 
something else when I wish to.  This technique works provided you are not 
already using the alternate editor feature of Pine.  To use it, go into 
Config and enable-alternate-editor.  For the alternate editor, specify 
the shell script.  Then just invoke Ctrl-_ to make the change.  I am not 
a sed expert (I got this from someone else), but I suppose you could 
easily change it to _delete_ the leading '>' rather than just substitute 
for it.

Learn to read. I said "mail agent", not "news agent", and I asked "why",

Well, learn to read. I didn't say "combined agent", I said "mail agent".
Any agent that handles news should know about news headers, but that
isn't the question I asked, now is it?

Not here. Tell me why my mail agent has to know about news headers.

Agreed.  I use an integrated mail/news reader.  The problem isn't with the
theory.  The problem is with Pine.  It doesn't clearly and unequivocally
separate mail from news.

*blink blink*

I don't see why you'd need to look any further... No Path, it's not a news
message. It sure as HELL isn't a standard news message if it has no Path.
And that's all that should matter.

Well unless it's illegal, I see no reason not to try. Why else distribute the
source?
If I can't make it work, *shrug*

I can. Why not hack on 3.91 while I'm waiting? I certainly won't let our
users run it unless its functional.

That's fine. But that definately means I'm going to see what I can do with
3.91 in the meantime. We have 10,000+ users, most of which are pretty ignorant
of the Internet, and I want to minimize the problems that can happen by them
not understanding the difference between news and mail...

Cool.

I really do love PINE. It's all I use for mail. People ridicule me for not
using Elm...  They laughed at me... Well I'll show them! I'll make them all
pay! AHAHAHAHAHA!!

The difference is between saying "Hey, I have a question but I can't be
bothered to actually read this group, just email the answer", which *is*
rather rude and presumtious and somewhat arrogant, and something such as "I
have a question but I don't reguarlly read this group. If someone could
be so kind as to reply in Email I'd really appreacite it! Thank!".

And as pointed out, it's also nice to post a summary. SHaring and all that.
For example, I asked about a particular .MOD on alt.binaries.sounds.mod and
received a variety of responses, all polite. Mostly because my request was
phrased politely, *and* because I said I'd post the .MOD once I found it!
(Haven't yet, darn it.)

P.S.
  It's possible to post to a Usenet newsgroup even if you don't have news
access, thanks to Email gateways. But it's important to indicate this in a
request and still offer to post results...

P.P.S.
  It's also important to check FAQ's and such first.

This is what I'm trying to tell you.  It isn't possible.  The best that
you can do is a crude approximation, and there are cases in which it won't
work.

3.92 will be coming out soon; it fixes the cause of accidental postings
and it does it right.  Why not wait until it's out.

Pine 3.92 will come out Real Soon Now.  We can't make any promises yet.
However, the "to-do" list is getting shorter.  In case it isn't obvious,
it will be a major new release.

Integrated news/mail readers have existed for years in the UUCP world and 
don't show any signs of confusing their users.

You told the person who was going to implement it himself that the best
he could do is a crude approximation. You told him what he wanted to do
wasn;t possible. If he can't do an analysis of the header to do it
right, why can you?

SOmething that Pine should have been doing from the moment it tried to
be a newsreader.

This is good. How do you plan on doing this? Consider that mailed copies
of posted articles often contain NO indication that they were posted,
and posted copies of articles whihc were also mailed often contain NO
indictaion that they were also mailed. You aren't, I hope, creating some
Pine kludge that puts all sorts of news headers in mail so Pine can
detect things, and then claim that every other mailer is broken because
it doesn't understand the way Pine does it, are you?

Will you support the proposed RFC for Posted-To:, and wait until it is
adopted before running off and doing it your own way?

Funny. I have mail tools which allow hierarchical folder browsing, and
they don't know anything about IMAP.

I have a problem. PINE unfortunately does not respond to queries because 
of its tremendous acceptance.
I use pine as my email server. The Naval Academy also uses pine. A Naval 
Cadet is home for the holidays and would like to retrieve his important 
messages from his email address via the internet without repeated use of 
long distance lines. Is it possible. Any help appreciated.

I will go back to the analogy of a crowded room.  The person who is
unfamiliar with the group should either hang around and figure out what the
social rules of the crowd are and what has brought the group together.  It
is extremely boorish to barge into the room, saying "I do not have time to
waste getting to know/know about you people, but I insist that someone stop
what they are doing and tell me how to solve my problem.  I am not going to
hang around long enough to let you explain it to me, so I want you to write
up the solution and find an envelope and go out to the post office and mail
it to my home.  I wrote the address on a slip of paper and you will have to
pick it up off the floor somewhere over there."  These jerks are usually
asking a FAQ that has been discussed at least twice that week anyway.  If
they would hang around for about three days they would usually find the
answer.

I think such people should be excoriated by all and sundry.

With a proper news reader the task of screening 1000's of messages is not
all that time consuming.  I use nn, which allows me to rapidly search all
the headers in a newsgroup and tag those messages that I am interested in
for reading.  nn has no peer that I know of in this regard.  All the others
I have tried require me to constantly go back and forth between the Subject
headers menu and reading articles, which is wasted motion.

Many newbies use readers that have easy-to-use features that severely limit
a knowledgeable user's ability to get things done.

There needs to be a standard for news readers that makes it difficult for
someone to post without being assaulted with the FAQ.

I post the answer and mail to the user if they want the answer they are
going to have to go back and read the group.

The FAQ's need to be easier to access from the newsreader, both for the
newbie and for the poster who wants to double-check the FAQ before saying
"It is in the FAQ."

To all those people who helped with my "lost" mail problem,

   Thank you all for your prompt helps. This is the best Christmas 
gift I ever get. According to many experts' suggestions, I did find my
mail under ~/Mail/received which elm created when I quit from elm. The
major difference here between pine and elm as many experts pointed out
is that pine and elm use different mail directory. Elm use ~/Mail and
pine use ~/mail. So I recovered all my received mails and reply them
just on time to all my friends. Thanks a lot!

I am using Pine with ispell, and when I call the spell program, it

Hi all,

I understand that there is a version of Pine available for Vax/VMS systems, and would 
be interested if anybody knows where I might obtain the code.  Archie points to 
ftp.ias.wa.waw.pl, however this site has always been unreachable when I attempt to contact it.
If there is anyone around who has experience in installing Archie on VMS, I'd really like to 
hear from you!

Cheers,

wierd values such as LINES=1 and COLUMNS=1, or LINES =231 and COLUMNS=231,
then Pine will Loop when it tries to open the main screen. 

This can be a problem on HP systems, because the command 'ttytype' is 
busted under certain circumstances.

[mailed and posted]

In the version I use (3.91), when you save a msg you are writing (have 
written), by using ^O (Postpone), a temp file (folder) called 
postponed-msgs is created.  Open that folder through your folder list, 
as you would any other folder and print the msg.  Hope this helps.  

Merry Christmas.

Sure.  Using your account, he can use the "telnet" coommand.  In your
shell, type "telnet your.cadet's.domain" and press RETURN.  Then follow
the prompts for login and password.  That should get him on his system. 
(Make note of the escape character, which is usually "^]" in case you get
stuck.)  At his system prompt, type PINE and read away. 

Hope this helps.

Why is this so?  A number of people have been wondering for a while and

"anti-false" means "true", does it not?

Hi,

Tried several makefiles (osf.bsd. sv4 ....). It failed, of course.
Is there anyone who worked it out?
Thanx in advance for solutions

If you aren't motivated to provide an answer to such questions, then
don't.  That's simple enough.  But if you are going to go to the
trouble to make a reply is it too much extra work for you to send
a copy the way they asked?  Most newsreaders provide exactly the
mechanism you need, and for good reason.  And if you feel that
others on the newsgroup would like to see your response it is equally
easy to send a copy there at the same time, for equally good reasons.

That remains a matter of opinion.

Many people like receiving email copies, and it is normal for
reasonable people to think that other reasonable people will
share their preferences.  Often this is untrue, but it is normal...

Or they think that if you send out something with your return
address on it you are interested in receiving replies.   If
you aren't, hmmm...

Indeed, this is a problem, and the one that should be fixed. This
could also fix the problem of not being able to tell if the message
was also posted.

If you don't want a reply, why not stop posting?  Or keep your email
address off of it?

    (I use Unix Pine 3.91.)

    From time to time when I am composing a message or reply, I want to 
include another message from some folder as part of what I am composing.  
At present, I have to postpone the composed message, open the folder, 
export the other message to a temporary external file, go back into the 
composer, and read in (Ctrl-R) the temporary file (and remember later to 
delete the temporary).  This works, certainly, but it is a little clumsy.

    Has anyone come up with a smoother technique for this, such as a 
shell script or a Perl program?  If anyone has a good technique they 
are willing to share, I will put in in my World Wide Web page, where I 
already have a couple of useful Pine techniques.  Thanks.

This may not be what you want, but I frequently make a series of messages,
usually from people asking me the same sorts of questions, and do an
aggregate reply, or aggregate forward.  Once they are marked, I do a zoom,
unselect any messages I do not want, and type <a><r>, or <a><f>

**** Wrong model. ****

When reading Usenet News, you do not read thousands of postings to
find the single answer, or filter out unwanted messages.

Your *select* the *one subject heading* that contains the answer.

There is a difference between selecting and filtering out.

You 'filter out' some things that you never want to see, e.g., postings
from specific people, or specific subjects you never want to see.  You
'select' whatever you do want to see, e.g., the specific subject heading
under which you posted the inquiry.

"Post and email" fails badly because in its usual mode of operation
the email may be sent to the wrong person.  For example:

     A posts an inquiry.
     B posts a follow-up.
     C follows up to B.
     D follows up to B.
     E follows up to A.

If each person does "post and email" in its usual mode of operation,
A will get responses only from B and E, but not from C and D.  Thus A
will need to browse Usenet himself to see all the responses.  If he
does, he will see some things (from B and E) twice and others (from C
and D) only once.  This is confusing.

Mark seems to be assuming that any Newsgroups header in email is
bogus.  This assumption is incorrect.

Such a header may be considered to be bogus if it appears in email and
the email was NOT sent in response to a posting that appeared in the
newsgroups listed in the Newsgroups header.

True.  But why should the person who asked the question be expected to
read thousands of messages in the newsgroup to find the single answer, or
otherwise be forced to filter out all the unwanted messages?  I think that
it's awfully parochial to insist that someone must subscribe to a
newsgroup in order to ask any questions.

Sometimes, it is the case that a person needs to ask a question about a
particular topic that normally she is not interested in.  The obvious
thing to do is to check at the newsgroup devoted to that topic.  It is
unreasonable to expect her to search through thousands of messages for an
answer.

If the newsgroup has an easy-to-find FAQ, it may be a good idea to check
there, but all too often the FAQ is not in evidence.  Unless the site
supports a threaded database, even the act of scanning the subjects of the
newsgroup for "FAQ" can be time-consuming.

This is an excellent example where it would be reasonable for the reply to
be directed both by news and by email.

Typical example:
	% post comp.sys.blurdybloop
	Subject: can Blurdybloop computers support Garply protocol?
	Hello.  Our site is migrating to Garply protocol.  Most of our
	machines are Gazork systems, but we have one Blurdybloop system
	installed years ago that handles our payroll.  Is it possible
	to get Garply protocol support on Blurdybloop computers?
	Please reply by email, since I don't normally read this newsgroup.

You may claim that it's her fault for not reading comp.sys.blurdybloop for
the past several years, thus knowing about the very active discussion of
Garply support that took place six months ago.  But most human beings find
themselves obliged to concentrate their attention on what they do every
day; in this case, she's reading comp.sys.gazork.

Why not just answer "Check the FAQ file, ftp://blurdybloop.com/FAQ"?
That's what happens in most civilized newsgroups.

Hi, there

   Just a moment ago. I use the elm to open my mailbox. After I quit,
I use pine to open it, but all my mails are lost. I think I may press
'n' when I quit the elm. All the mails are very important to me. Some of
them I need to reply today. I really hope any expert who can help me
recover my mails. I know it's little hope but I still wish ...

   Thank you very much! Please e-mail your answer to me!

I have a shell connection to the local university so all my activity
is done on its computer with me downloading files into my system.
I'm wondering what the procedure is for me to attach a small text
file which is on my c:\ drive to email messages I send using the
Pine program the university has setup on its system (Unix operating
system). It appears I have to upload the file into the university's
directories for Pine to find the file. Is there an easier way and what
are the procedures required to attach that file on my local computer
to the email sent from the shell account?

And what about newsreaders that (correctly) let inews generate the Path:
header?

Of course we already know that Pine doesn't like working with standard Unix
software, given that it tries to take over sendmail's job and bypass the

In a previous article, riffer@freenet2.freenet.ufl.edu (Jeff Mercer) says:

    Odd.  I can use IMAP to read from an IMAP4 server and get news
messages which I export to a file, which are news messages without
full headers.  I think it's also possible to save a message without
full headers, and certainly one can use tools other than Pine to save
messages which are later referred to by Pine with IMAP2bis.  I'd say
that these are still news messages even when they have no Path: header.

    Maybe you want to delve into the details of IMAP to see how the
traditional distinction between mail and news is becoming increasingly
blurred in a distributed environment.  I view Pine more as a power tool
for the latter, with its IMAP support, and I don't even use it as a
replacement for a read-the-local-spool mail or news program.  If that's
what you use it for, you're really missing out on the benefits it has
to offer.  Remember, the whole world is not NNTP and /var/spool/mail ,
and many sites are moving away from this as it fails to meet their
needs.


    I'm posting this only to comp.mail.pine .  I feel it has no real
reason to be introduced into the other groups where this thread can
be found.

The default for pine is to save your outgoing mail in ~/mail/sent-mail,
unless the site-wide conf file has it turned off.

Sure, but it does require a little setup.  When you setup an email alias 
for the person (take their address)  you can setup their own personal FCC.

Minus the Path header, one gets a very nonstandard News message.
Since there is no good definition for a 'nonstandard News message',
one enters a no-man's land, which is always risky.

I believe your analysis is wrong.

1. The fact that an IMAP server gives you "nonstandard" News
   postings with incomplete headers proves nothing about News
   postings.  Rather, it proves something about the IMAP server or the
   IMAP protocol.

      The IMAP protocol as currently implemented is not suitable for
      Usenet browsing.  A client reading Usenet via IMAP may get false
      information, because the IMAP design includes no mechanism to
      distinguish between News and email.

   The workaround for this is to treat anything obtained via IMAP as
   email.  If might have been originally News, but it has been
   converted to email.  Post no followups to it.  This solves all
   problems and minimizes confusion.

   The long-term solution will be to revise the IMAP protocol so
   it can properly tell the difference.

2. In general, if a message has no Path header, it should be treated as
   email.  Post no followups to it.

The designers of IMAP may have made some fundamental errors of concept
similar to the errors made by the designers of pine.  News is not
email, and software designed to lose the information that preserves
this distinction may fail to work properly when it encounters Usenet
postings or when it encounters email messages that contain a Newsgroups
header.

BTW, I hear some people saying roughly "News vs email is a protocol
issue.  If you ignore the underlying protocol there is no distinction
between News and email."  I believe these people are missing the
distinction between lower-level transport and networking protocols
(e.g.  TCP/IP vs ISO) and high-level applications-level protocols (e.g.
UUCP vs NNTP vs SMTP) and still higher level "applications" themselves
(e.g. email vs News).  They are assuming that everything occurs at just
a single layer called 'the protocol' and that there is no difference
between News and email except for the difference at this (incorrect)
level of abstraction.

>Maybe you want to delve into the details of IMAP to see how the
>traditional distinction between mail and news is becoming increasingly
>blurred in a distributed environment.

You seem to be saying, in effect, that IMAP discards information, and
so everybody else should do the same thing.

I have seen a tendency, lately, for a number of people to say "xxx
software can't tell the difference between News and email, so there is
no difference."  This conclusion is wrong!  If xxx software cannot tell
the difference, it just means that xxx software is broken.  Ignoring
the difference does not make the difference go away.

It takes no great stretch of imagination to hear the same people saying
"xxx software can't tell the difference between protons and electrons,
so there is no difference", or "xxx software can't tell the difference
between men and women, so there is no difference", and so on.

I saw some messages recently about using Pine with POP3.  Pine won't directly
talk to a pop server, but if you use a pop client to retrieve messages, they
can be read with Pine and Pine can also be used to post mail.  I use it
regularly with popclient under Linux.

Hmm.  I have HP-UX and SVR2 using /usr/bin/remsh; and PTX and SVR4 using
/usr/bin/resh.  SVR2 is represented by an ATT Unix PC (3B1 or 7300); I'm
not sure what SVR4 represents.

Other interesting ones are /usr/bin/restsh on Data General, /usr/bin/rsh
on AIX on PowerPC, Altos, BSDI, ICL DRS/NX, Linux, NetBSD, SGI, and
Solaris; /bin/rsh on AIX on RT; and /usr/bin/rcmd on SCO.

Everything else is /usr/ucb/rsh.

Much of this information is hearsay, and needs to be taken with a grain of
salt.

I hve an even more annoying problem-- I use a dial-up shell account.
When reading my mail, often I would like to reply by sending a file that
exists on my Macintosh.

It is tedious to quit PINE, Zmodem the file to the Unix box, open pine
again, & then attach the file.  Oh, I forgot converting it to a neutral
ASCII format so if the recipient is using a computer that's too stupid
to recognize Mac format files he will be able to read it...

Any way to get PINE to burrow backwards & zmodem a specified filename?

  I have a SCO system and recently obtained Gunther Anderson's port of
Pine for SCO Unix 3.2.4.  Everything works fine, except when we use a
couple of non-standard terminal types that I know exist in our Terminfo
library.  Pine says that it doesn't know about the terminal types.  Does
Pine use Terminfo or Termcap?  Or maybe internal terminal definitions?

Subject: Bugged-up COMPOSE

When I try to continue an interrupted COMPOSE, I get thrown out of Pine with a "bug" message. I am connected to a Unix machine at a university; can I find some Pine file in my personal directory which I can erase to make the program forget the COMPOSE?

A decently maintained news server sets eexpiry on *answers* in excess of 
40 days, and respects the "Expires:" header in FAQ  postings.

Of course there are innnumerable badly maintained servers which are 
pressed for space and have cut purge/*answers* retention to a few
days. :(

The quick answer is "edit more savagely"

Your news admin has chosen to enforce a 50% quoting rule.

Be glad Zie hasn't added the server patches which deal with people 
changing the quote character....

I don't have any trouble wading through large newsgroups and finding answers,
because I have this great newsreader that lets me search headers for ones
that match the uestion I posted. It's called pine.

Pine makes it pretty easy, why is it unreasonable?

Not with pine it's not. Use the "w" key to find words in which you are
interested.

There are situations in which I agree with you, but there are situations
where it should not be necesary. On the other hand, it's the owner of the
mailbox that is asking for it to be stuffed, so why should I mind? ;-)

    In your mail directory (where Pine puts its folders), look for a 
folder named "postposed-msgs" or something like that.  (By the way, your 
post came across, at least to my reader, as one single, continuous line.)

    Unix Pine (at least version 3.91) does not necessarily require that 
you quit entirely to upload a file.  It may be a compile-time or 
system-wide configuration option, but the copy of Pine available to my 
Unix shell account responds to Ctrl-Z to suspend.

    I can start a composition, suspend Pine, upload a file from my PC to 
my current Unix directory, resume Pine with the 'fg' (foreground) 
command, and immediately read in the uploaded file with Ctrl-R.  This 
may not be perfect, but it does not require stopping and restarting Pine, 
just suspending it and resuming at the point of suspension, only 
requiring a few keystrokes.

    As for other computers being too "stupid" to understand Mac format, 
well, that's life.  Some people might say, with equal justification, that 
Mac is too "stupid" to do things the way other systems do it.  There 
simply is no sufficient standardization for now, and we have to live with 
that.

If on is using an error-correcting modem, then the easiest way to insert
across the modem is to simply send the text across the link.  In the good
old days, all comms programs had "text send" options.  Also in the good old
days, one of the standard ways of sending a file to your host was to open
the editor and send the file to the editor.  This would be very appropriate
way of solving this problem.

There is a standard for text files, a flat file, and Mac is the only system
that does not follow it.  Line end chars are easily translated.

Since Mac is the only one that uses the forked file format, and since it is
the responsibility of the sender of a message to make sure the message is
received, if the result is important to them, I would say the stupidity
resides in the sender who doesn't bother to send in a lang that is
understandable to the recipient.

Might wanna try uploading the file *before* going into PINE. DUH!!

*sigh*

A computer is not "stupid" if it doesn't recoginize a proprietary format.
Would you like it if I called you stupid because you couldn't speak fluent
German, French, Spanish, and Ukranian?

>Any way to get PINE to burrow backwards & zmodem a specified filename?

Actually, based on what you say your doing, I would strongly recommend using
uqwk to read your mail (and news if you so wish) offline with the excellent
MacSoup program. Makes it easy to attach files and let's MacGeeks play with
all the mac-specific crap they want...

  Could someone instruct me on forwarding a users  mailbox to another id
  via pine?

  I believe it has something to do with the .forward file.  Any 
instruction would be appreciated.

		Thank you,

Is there a way while composing a message in pine to go to the top of the 
file or the end of the file?  (Other than using control Y or control V 
repeatedly.)

Thanks for asking a GOOD question (ie., one that I've had :-).  You prompted
me to investigate, and here are the results:

WHEN COMPOSING
Press ^w for WHERE
 then ^y for search for first line
   or ^v for search for last line

WHEN READING
Press w for WHERE
 then ^y for search for first line
   or ^v for search for last line

Three or four keys!  Not too bad.

Hi All,

I am trying to attach a binary file to an outgoing email intended for 
aol.com, and my mail gets bounced back with a warning that the message is 
too long.  I have read all of the PINE help files and I cannot find a way 
to tell it to break the message up into chunks.  Does such a facility 
exist?  If not, is there a better way (other than suggesting to my 
clients that they not use aol)?

Thanks,

Is the cover note too long -- or the binary attachment?
Try just sending the cover letter.  Splitting up the binary and putting
it back together is a lot trickier than splitting up a text file.

Hello!

How do I override the default username when I access remote folders ? 
I've got my pinerc configured as thus :

# Updated by Pine(tm) 3.91, copyright 1989-1993 University of Washington.

incoming-folders=PROBE	{probe.vsc.edu}INBOX,

	blah blah blah

All is happy except that I have a different username on some hosts and 
would like to be able to do something like :

incoming-folders=PROBE  {probe.vsc.edu/martelm}INBOX,

And then only need to enter a password. Is this possible ?

Thanks!

Michael

It is the binary attachment which is too long, once converted via 
BASE64.  Many mailers automatically break up attachments into multiple 
attachments of a maximum length (e.g. 10,000 bytes) so that they can pass 
through all possible gateways.  I thought perhaps pine could do this too, 
although I cannot find anything in the docs to confirm or deny this 
presumption.

Just create a file called .forward in the users home directory and put 
the address you want to forward to in the file.

Hi folks!

Is it possible to save newsgroup list from server locally? What I mean, 
currently when I hit Ctrl-T in Newsgroup header, Pine gets the list from 
server. Having very slow link, I am forced to wait 4-5 minutes for 
completion. Is it possible to save the list locally and manually 
'refresh' it if necessary (much as Netscape does)?

Also is it possible to get a 'hierarchical' view of newsgroups? That is 
to get a alt.*, comp.* and so on at first level and then descend as 
necessary? (Again much as Netscape does - I am not much of a fan of 
Netscape but it has some fine points).

If it is not implemented, consider it as Feature request :-)

thanks in advance and
			Happy New Year to you all!

You would simplify it by using the same login-name.
That way, you could still leave it to pine and the only thing you 
would have to alter was user-domain=wam.umd.edu (in .pinerc)

Hello,

	I'm trying to email from my Linux box which accesses the net through
a dial-up PPP connection.  My Linux box is "citadel.umd.edu".  Which of
course, doesn't really exist on the 'Net.  

	I made a modification to my sendmail.cf file to automatically set
the "From:" header from any email from "cabal" (my Linux box's login
name) to my real email address which is "lotu@wam.umd.edu".

	This works great when I use the regular "mail" program to send
email.  However, when I compose a message from PINE, it still puts in the
"From:" header: "cabal@citadel.umd.edu".  I was told by somebody that the
problem is that PINE is putting in a "From:" header itself instead of
letting sendmail do it.  How do I tell PINE not to put in a "From:" header
and let sendmail do it?

	Thanks!

Alan D. Bulley (abulley@spu.stpaul.uottawa.ca) decia:
: Hello,

: Does anyone know if it is possible to configure pine in such a way 
: that I can receive a "confirmation of delivery" for the mail I send 
: out? The mailer I used previously on CMS did this, and I often found 
: it useful to know that my e-mail had arrived at its destination.

  Yes... you can....

  From the M(enu), pres S(etup), then c(onfig)... then look for
  customized-hdrs        = 

  press A(dd)
  and put:
                           Return-Receipt-To:

  *unless* you want a return receipt for *every* mail that you
  send, do not put your email address after the colon. If you do
  so, *every* time that you send mail (even to newsgroups?...mmm I
  do not know that one),you will receive a receipt.

  If you want for "return-receipt-to" to apear in your standard
  headers when you compose... you need to add it also (with A(dd),
  in the line:
  default-composer-hdrs  =

  If not, the only thing you need, is when you compose, and are in
  the headers to use ^R (control + r), and return receipt will
  apear.

  HOpe it helps

  Pucho

: Any experiences with this or ideas that are worth trying?

: Thanks!

Why not just setup a 'reply-to' line with your correct information?  Lots 
of people these days have 'from' lines that are not really email 
addresses.  A Reply-to line will work simply wonderfully.... wait, I've 
just re-read your message and you have a Reply To line (I think it should 
be Reply-To rather than Reply To [no spaces]) so I'm guessing you don't 
like that solution.... well, you could always make a username lotu on 
your Linux box with a ~lotu/.forward file with contents 'cabal' but I 
don't really know what problem you are having, so I'll end this now..

	Thanks all for trying! :-)

	But somebody just emailed me with the solution.  It involves
modifying the source to allow the user to change the From: heading.

Subject: Using PC-Pine Offline?
Date: 28 Dec 1995 17:43:12 GMT
Message-Id: <4bukvg$65u@netaxs.com>

Is there a way to configure PC-Pine for Windows or Dos (and which 
version) so that it can be used when not online, i.e. without engaging 
Winsock?  I cannot get it started.  It indicates that required files or 
libraries are missing.

If not, is there another news reader which permits reading and 
reorganizing of folders saved in Pine.

I use a slip account and would like to download the folders and read them 
on a PC.

Thanks.

When a message is sent in Pine, the words "Writing Fcc..." appear.
What does this mean and what is pine doing?

I have lots of links related to Pine at:

  http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/pine/

To get to my Filtering Mail FAQ, follow the link called "FAQs".

Good luck,

It's saving a 'carbon copy' ... the default is to save it to a folder 
named sent-mail, but you can change that ... universally under Setup 
Config, or individually under Addressbook Edit Fcc.  Hope that helps.

I just discovered that when I reply to a user that is in my addressbook 
with appropriate fcc value, the copy will be done to a folder with the 
same name as the loginname of the receipient.

Can this be changed by configuration or is it not possible ?

I don't. That's simple. That's also ignoring the problem.

I do not see such a mechanism in trn, which is a very common

That is a matter of the RECIPIENT'S opinion. WHen the recipient tells
you it is rude, it is rude.  When the recipient tells you to stop, you
should stop. Why is this a difficult concept?

It is now unreasonable to not want email copies of news articles
wasting your mailbox space. Thanks for being so objective in your
arguments.

The issue is not one of receiving replies, and you should be smart
enough to know that. It is one of getting those replies via a DIFFERENT
mechanism than the original article.  When I post news, I look in news
for replies. I don't ask for mail unless I think the answers are
important enough to demand IMMEDIATE attention, which is what I have to
give email. People who assume that any answer they give to any comment I
make is important enough to demand immediate attention are assuming too
much responsibility for themselves.

And this is an admission that sending mail cannot possibly be considered
"continuing the thread" -- one of the arguments for doing it.

>If you don't want a reply, why not stop posting?  

This isn't the issue, and you should be smart enough to know that.

>Or keep your email address off of it?

If you put your phone number in your article, are you saying that you
would find it permissible for people to call you and read you what they
have just posted? Are you familiar with RFC 1036 at all? You must not be
to make this sort of comment.

I would like to second this. It should be built in.  It is a narural wish
to keep all mail related to some person (or mailing list) in one place.
One can also choose to put mail to/from more than one person in ONE FCC

I would like to know if it's possible modify the contents of the

I'm interested in hide the host name from it.
I'm using pine 3.91 in HP-UX and Linux machines.

Any comments will be useful.

This is like saying, "Why should someone reading a newspaper for a
single article be forced to read or ignore hundreds of
uninteresting articles simply to get to it?"

If you're reading a newsgroup for a single article -- and, in
particular, a followup to your own article -- 

>	Subject: can Blurdybloop computers support Garply protocol?

-- then you search the newsgroup for messages with "blurdybloop"
or "garply" in the subject line.  If you have a newsreader that
doesn't do this, you get rid of it.

  riddle: How do you sculpt an elephant?
  answer: get a big block of marble and carve away everything
          that doesn't look like an elephant.

I use a very nice newsreader, called "trn," which tells me at a
glance whether there have been any followups to a particular
article (e.g. my own), and will take me to those followups
instantly.  Perhaps you might consider adding such a feature to
Pine.

  I've implemented this patch and I haven't seen a runaway pine since - over
many (4 or so) months:


From: S.Vickery@its.gu.edu.au (Sean Vickery)
Newsgroups: comp.mail.pine
Subject: Runaway Pine bug solved, patch included
Date: 13 Aug 1995 23:15:19 -0700

[If you reply or followup to this, could you please Cc: me as I read neither
 pine-info nor comp.mail.pine.]

Fellow Pine users,

After some frustrating months of tracking down runaway Pine processes each
day and killing them by hand, I decided to find and fix the cause of the
problem in the Pine sources.

Some debugging revealed that the hanging Pines are doing a tight loop
in read_with_timeout().  The logic in this function is slightly awry;
it does not cater for read(terminal) returning zero bytes.  My patch is at
the end of this message;  it's a one-line fix.  Not one Pine has run away
since I patched them a week ago.  Before I patched Pine, I was getting
about one runaway Pine per day per machine on average.

I saw the problem only with Pine 3.91.  Pine 3.89, which we still use
on some of our machines, has never runaway on us.  Pine 3.91 was running
away on both Solaris 2.3 and 2.4.

If there are any Pine developers reading this, perhaps you could fix the
bug in the next release of Pine.

Cheers for now,
Sean.

Not sure what you mean by 'appropriate fcc value' but you can fcc to any 
folder name you wish, does NOT have to go to a folder with the 
recipient's login name, but apparently that's the way you set up your 
fcc's.  For example, I correspond with 6 or 7 people about golf related 
topics, and fcc all of that to a folder named saved-golf-stuff.  It 
sounds like what you did is change the fcc in Config Setup to recipient, 
rather than the default sent-mail folder.  Another way is to leave the 
default as sent-mail, then in your Addressbook Edit set the fcc for each 
correspondent to the folder you wish it to go to.  Hope that's clear, if 
not, post or feel free to email me for a clarification.  BYE

Exactly Peter, there is, and the problem is that this group name is 
comp.mail.pine not comp.news.pine and my description of it says something 
like for discussions about the pine mail program or something to that 
effect.  This entire stupid thread was started by someone who mistakenly 
posted and emailed when he only meant to email, no big whoop, we all make 
mistakes, but then everyone started screaming at one another, and 
critisizing the folks at washington.edu, and the entire discussion has 
gotten totally off track.  Is PINE the best mail program ... proabably 
for what you paid for it.  Is PINE the best newsreader ... Probably not.  
OK having said that, everyone have a happy and prosperous new year, and 
please stop yelling at one another.  Only my 1895 cents worth (plus tax).

As a followup to my own posting, I might add that this machine is also
addresable as menger.stevens-tech.edu, and if I put in pine.conf:
user-domain=menger.stevens-tech.edu
I get correct resolving of local usernames.  This leads me to believe

I'm trying to set up Pine 3.90 on SunOS 4.1.3 machine with NIS and
DNS.  The machine-name is "menger", and is in the "eecs" subdomain of
"stevens-tech.edu".
The default pine.conf has "user-domain=menger.eecs.stevens-tech.edu", 
but when composing mail to a local user, the address comes up as
user@eecs.stevens-tech.edu, instead of
user@menger.eecs.stevens-tech.edu

I've been trying different settings to get it to work, but I can't
seem to get it to put the correct hostname in the field.
Can someone help?  I'd appreciate personal mail - I'll post a summary
of useful responses.
Thanks,

Hi folks!

I don't quite understand rules for sorting of folders. I currently have 
set sorting rule to OrderedSubject, and just now there are two messages 
in my folder (actually they are on Pine-info list so everybody should 
have them).

One message is original and other a reply. Original dated 30 Dec 1995 
06:11 GMT (I forgot the seconds) and reply is dates 30 Dec 1995 06:16 GMT.

The problem is, reply is sorted BEFORE original message. It seems to be 
incorrect twice - reply should NOT come before question  and Dates order 
is clearly wrong. 

If I set sort order to Date, then they are sorted correctly!

Any comment? (I have Pine for Windows 3.91)

Thanks in advance

I see.

Am I allowed to conclude, then, that the whole of Pine's support
for Usenet reading and posting constitutes a bug?

Hi there,
  I am just a local user and not a sysadmin, though I am familiar with
stuff involving UNIX.
  This system does not offer a working pico editor, and I was thinking
of just installing it in my $HOME for my personal use (so I don't have
to us vi for email ;)
  I went through the ftp pico directory at your site, but did not see
anything for pico that would run on SCO UNIX.  Is there one available,
or does one of the other versions run on SCO?
  Also, and this is important, once fully installed on SCO (if it exists)
how much disk space does it use up?
Thanks for your help :)

My attitude would be in agreement with the above statement.

I would simply like to be able to config it so that it does not do
any newsreader stuff, except allow me to look at article archives that have
been saved in mbox format.  Then it would be impossible for a naive user at
my site to innapriately post a private email reply.  I used to simply not
configure the nntphost variable, but too many people complained about it not
working "right".  I would simply like to destroy all evidence that it is
even supposed to be able to do anything with news.

Hi!
I am wondering if there is a way to have mail sent every day to a 
specific address.... 
What I need to do is mail some thing different everyday to one person and 
what I would like to do is just type it all up every week and run a 
command every morning to send it...?

Also, is there a way to have an automated reply to a specific address?
Wondering if there is a way I can tweak the Unix 'vacation' program
to do this?

Thanks for any help!

Hello folks:
	
	When I'm in C(ompose mail), the ^R(ead file) command followed by
the ^T(o files) command, then <S>(elect) does not import the selected file
into my message as I assumed it would. Instead I have to type the name of
the file in after using ^R while in Compose. (Pine 3.91 on a dial-up Unix 
shell account.) I've consulted PINE Users Guide & FAQ to no avail.

	Is the answer simply that the files screen is merely an 
informational browser? If so, why the Select command?

	Many thanks...

No, I kept the default to sent-mail

That's exactly what I did !

In the addressbook I specified an Fcc for some entries. When I send mail
to one of these, the copy is placed in the specified folder instead of the
default Fcc, this is what I expected and like. 

When I however *reply* to a party that has an entry in my addressbook with
the Fcc field filled in, the copy is done to a folder with the username of
this recipient. This is not what I expected :-(

In your example of the Golf-related subject, it might be handy also if all
reply's are *automatically* copied in the Fcc corresponding to the entry
in your addressbook. Ofcourse this is only handy if all of these users are
related to this subject, otherwise you must specify the Fcc by hand or 
let it default to "sent-mail" and sort it out later.

While responding to this message, Pine wanted to put the Fcc in a (not 
yet existing) folder "jgvd" although the default-Fcc is still "sent-mail" 
and there is no entry for you in my addressbook. By hand I changed the 
Fcc to "pine.out", all other messages of this list are saved in "pineYYMM".

If PINE is installed on your system, PICO should be there also !

PICO is a standard component of the distrubution of PINE, but you can 
decide to do a make for PICO alone ofcourse. Do you need a binary ?

The size of PICO on our SCO 3.2v4.2 is about 150kByte.

I think I missed part of this thread, so pardon me if this has already
been suggested.
 
It sounds like you have your "fcc-name-rule" set to "by-recipient". 
Change it to "default-fcc".  This will cause messages to people _without_
fcc values in your Address Book to be saved to the default fcc folder
(sent-mail or whatever), but messages to people _with_ fcc values will be
saved to the folders specified by those fcc values.

I would use "cron" to run a shell-script that pipes the desired message 
into the standard "mail"-command. You could look into a simple 
application like "calendar".

As far as I know ... this is what "vacation" is made for ! Or do you want 
to give automatically an "intelligent" response, so you can go on 
hollidays and still earn money ?

Sorry, I don't think I understand your intension completely, could you be 
more specific ?

	Some people feel that to reveal their hostname can result in
security problems.  Their intentions are not as you cite.  In any case
your use of profane language is inappropriate.

Does anyone know of a mail reader for DOS or Windows that can
dialup and retrieve mail from Unix hosts without using SLIP or PPP?

You are right about the setting and its meaning Francis, but in both 
cases if the Fcc is set in the addressbook, it is ignored.

I used fcc-namerule=by-recipient, because mostly I want the Fcc to
correspond to the name of the other party.

The Fcc in the addressbook entry works for Compose, but not for Reply.

According to the doc's Pine has difficulty with some terminal types.

And PICO has word-wrap, justify, simple block operations, that vi leaks.

We run the same binary on all SCO versions including OpenServer 5.0 as 
well as versions without TCP/IP but then as a MUA only.

We use Kendra's UUPC, this is a UUCP implementation for DOS, and it 
includes a MUA and a Newsreader.

I prefer Pine, but it needs TCP/IP and a remote host running IMAP, but 
maybe this will be configurable someday ?!?!

Why can't my postings to a newsgroup get out. (other than my site.)

When i post a message to a newsgroup it's as if the posting does not exist
on the other sites.

I see my posting on my local site, But anyother site it is not there.

I have verifyed this by sending out a post to a newsgroup
then telnet to another site, but when i check the newsgroup for my posting
the posting is not there.

I seem to get answers from my postings in whidbey.com but nowhere else.

This can be very frustrating!

Help on this would be greatly appreasheated.

If you consult my own installation notes it will give you pointers
to the materials.  I assume you'd like the free version, done by
Yehavi Bourvine at HUJI in Jerusalem.  Start at my page:

Gosh, Silsoe, that takes me back to the days of freezing cold
cross-country motor cycle journeys, back in student days in the
1960's.  Ho hum...

p.s.  Look out a decent usenet client, though.  On my favourite
VMS system, we run Madison NEWSRDR as our usenet news client.  
(I'm only using this present system temporarily, as my regular 
systems are "down" over the break.)  I'm unimpressed by both
Netscape and PINE as usenet clients.

good luck

On my system it works for Reply too.  I just created "testfolder", put 
you in my Address Book with fcc set to "testfolder", brought up your 
message for viewing, and pressed "R" to reply.  The "fcc" line at the top 
of this reply says "testfolder", as expected.
 
I have "fcc-name-rule" set to "default-fcc".  After I send this off I'll 
change it to "by-recipient" and see if the fcc behavior is different.

This time my setup is as before (replying to your message, your address 
in my Address Book with fcc set to "testfolder") except that I now have 
fcc-name-rule set to "by-sender".  The "testfolder" fcc associated with 
your address still appeared on the "fcc" line in this reply.

Tony:

	I use a dial up account to a Unix provider. I use Slipknot which
is, as the name implies, a web browser which does not require SLIP/PPP. 
Your server must provide access for Slipknot (or I-comm, a competitive
product.)
	Slipknot and I-comm are shareware. Let me know if you need an address.

Could it be that the address you are replying to doesn't match exactly the
address in your address book?

Or, if there is another entry in your address books with the same address,
and that entry comes earlier, and that entry doesn't have an fcc, that
would do it.

You may conclude whatever you wish; All I meant to say was that PINE for
all it's merits as a mail agent is not the best newsreader available, and
if one insists on using it for usenet posting and reading, then when it
asks you if you want to also post this reply, and you answer (y)es, don't
be surprised if your (r)eply also gets posted.  If you only want to 
reply, not post, answer (n)o to the question.  Why is that so difficult?

Those people are nimrods.  Obscuring the origin of a message is a
security risk in its own right.  Besides, if the nature of your
organization is so sensitive that even revealing the name of a
machine within it is dangerous, then simply removing it from the
Message-ID is not a sufficient solution.  Post from a different
system.

Crap.

I think you missed the context and came in late for this discussion.
The email being posted to Usenet was often sent by people not using
pine.  Thus these people do not have the choice of answering yes or no
to pine's prompts -- they are NOT using pine to begin with.  It's other
people who get email from them who repost it to Usenet.

hi,

i'm having some bad interactions with pine, listproc and mime.
i have some long documents that have some hi-ascii characters scattered 
through them. because of this pine mime-encodes them. people recieving 
them on non-mime email programs than get =20 and =098 for newlines and 
tabs etc. which makes a mess. plus listproc archives them with the =20 
and =09's which really sucks.

so, is there some easy way around this (besides laboriously picking out 
the hi-ascii characters,which are there because the doc originates as a 
partly hebrew doc, and the word proccessor doesn't save in true ascii).
like suppressing the mime encoding (i don't mind losing the few hi-ascii 
characters) or any other suggestions?

Subject: I need help. My postings don't seem to get out.


Why can't my postings to a newsgroup get out. (other than my site.)

When i post a message to a newsgroup it's as if the posting does not exist
on the other sites.

I see my posting on my local site, But anyother site it is not there.

I have verifyed this by sending out a post to a newsgroup
then telnet to another site, but when i check the newsgroup for my posting
the posting is not there.

I seem to get answers from my postings in whidbey.com but nowhere else.

This can be very frustrating!

Help on this would be greatly appreasheated.
