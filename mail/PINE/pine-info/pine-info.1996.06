Pine only supports Internet RFC-822 addressing syntax.

DECnet syntax is particularly problematic, since it collides with RFC-822
group syntax and source route syntax.

I suggest that you use sendmail rules to rewrite DECnet syntax into
Internet syntax, and use Internet syntax exclusively.

Don't try it with the command window or anything, open an xterm and invoke
pine within that.  Ideally you can invoke the xterm on the RS6k and let it
start pine right away:

/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -e /usr/local/bin/pine

I am not sure with the paths, it may be different for you, but you can check 
the dirs.  You can even configure your desktop menu on the Sun so you can
invoke pine with one mouse click, but it implies you need to have an .rhosts
file on the RS6k which allows you to login w/o password (only YOU of course!).
Read about this file in the manual pages: 

	man rhosts

You menu entry on the Sun (in .openwin-menu) could then look like this:

"Pine..." exec rsh name_of_rs6000 -l your_login_name /usr/X11/bin/xterm -e\
	/usr/local/pine

(As one single line, I had to break the line, so take the \ away and join
it back together.

Ok, I hope this helps.  Good luck,

Hi !

I'm using PCPine 3.93 (32-bit-Version, I think) with WIN 3.11 as an 
offline-mail-manager.
At the university I work with Pine under Unix and it works fine, but from 
time to time I have to copy some folders onto my home-PC (My PC has no 
net-connection, so Pine starts with a "Cannot connect"-Error).

I have configured my folder-collection like this:
Desktop D:\Mail\[]

It is possible to read the folders, but they are all readonly, so I 
cannot delete messages. But it is curiously possible to save messages 
into the other readonly folders which Pine has marked as readonly...

And it is also impossible to create new folders: Pine 
writes empty folderfiles onto my harddisk but is neither able to open 
them nor to save messages into.

When I save the first message from a folder A into a folder B, so the 
message will be added, but the line with the "From ..."-mark which marks 
the begin of a new message, has a new character at its beginn, so that 
Pine doesnt find this message.

Are there any suggestions to solve this problem ?

Thanx,

- Mark

Will PinePGP be part of the distribution ? It's a nice perl
filter script, that does the PGP support nearly as fine as
elm-2.4ME+19, where the pgp support is builtin.

A wish of mine would be pgp support like a new function:
	- add my public key as attachement
	- fetch others pgp public key from attachement and
	  feed it to pgp -ka to add it to the personal public
	  key ring.

Thanks

Hello, awhile back when 3.93 first came out I was sent a message with
details on how to continue using 3.91 if I chose----like a dummy I didn't
save the message. Does anyone out there have those instructions????? I use
pine to post to usenet groups a lot and I just can't afford the 2-3
minutes that it takes 3.93 to validate the newgroup when I'm posting.
Maybe i'm doing something wrong, but at this point I want my 3.91 back.
Please help. thanks, Joseph.

P.S. If you wouldn't mind emailing me any responses that would ge great.

Joseph,
Have you tried setting the "news-post-without-validation" feature?

Mark,
I can explain some, but not all, of what you are seeing.

The usual mailbox format used on Unix systems uses "From " lines as
message separators.  The PC-Pine mailbox driver for this format is
a READ-ONLY driver; that is, PC-Pine is not capable of appending
messages to folders in this format, nor updating their status fields.

The native mailbox PC-Pine uses is called "MTX" and it does not use
the "From " lines as message separators (it has a different separator
format with length and flag info in it.)

I don't know why PC-Pine is letting you append to a READ-ONLY folder,
nor do I understand why creating and using a new local folder is not
working for you.  If you have any additional data on those points,
please let us know.

Note that PC-Pine is not yet designed for off-line use, so you are
swimming upstream to a certain extent, but it should be possible to
save all the messages from a Unix-style folder that is READ ONLY into
a new native/local MTX folder, and have full R/W access to that MTX
folder.

Yes.  In the configuration screen, usually at the bottom of the selections, 
there is a line that says:

editor       = <No Value Set>  

type A to add a value then type in emacs.
Then set the feature enable-alternate-editor-implicity
this will atuomatically activate the editor you typed in above when you 
enter into the composer.  This way you will not have to use the ^_ command.

Hope this helps!!

	Was this documentation on forwarding your pine account to another 
	account?

	Not that I know of.  From what I know you have to set your 
forwards on the other accounts that you have.  But if Pine is able to do 
this I would like to know as well.

marked text being highlighted follows the cursor movement- to the last

I think your problem is that you TYPE "^^" (two symbols "^" in a row). But
 first "^" is not a character you should type, but rather indicates that you 
have to hold <CONTROL> key while typing "^". So, in other notation, to start
marking text, type
<CTRL>-^
and then move cursor to where you what the block of text to end. Then type
<CTRL>-K
to delete it.

If you knew that and didn't type two "^" in a row, I am sorry. I didn'y mean 
to insult you.

Yes there is, but to do that, you need to use a separate filter program.
The one I use is called, well, "filter" and comes with "elm" distribution.
If you have elm on your system, then you have this filter program; if not,
maybe your sysadm installed something similar, and you should check with him.

I've builded pine3.93, but it do not work correctly.  When I compose
message, after I confirm to send the message by press 'Y' ,pine will
suddently stop and has some error message like "received abort signal".
How can I solve this problem ?

Any suggestion would be highly appreciated,

In the version of PINE which the admin has recently installed, a feature
is missing which I found really useful in the previous version.  When you
have a "mailing list" in the address book, and you want to add only ONE of
the addresses in the list to a Cc: you cannot.  It used to be that you can
press "s" for select, and only the name you hi-lighted would be entered
into the message.  Now it's the entire list which is entered into the
message.

How can I get linux to maintain a list of active newsgroups?  When I try
to subscribe to a new group, pine has to check the nntp server for the
active groups.  If I want a list of available groups, pine must get the
list from the server and then get it again when I actually select the
group I want to subscribe to.  There has to be a way of speeding this up.
I run on a 28.8 connection.

Joseph, the pine-info mailing list is an international list for Pine users
and administrators odf systems using Pine.  The folks on the list have no
idea how we have things configured here.  If you have problems with any
aspect of your BCPL account, please contact the BCPL Help Desk at
oz@mail.bcpl.lib.md.us, or call 887-3297.
 
If you really want to go back to Pine 3.91, you may do so by entering
"pine391" at the UNIX shell prompt instead of just "pine". However, try
this before you go back to the old version: 
 
o Start up pine (not pine391).
o At the main menu enter "SC" to go to Pine's configuration screen.
o Scroll down until "news-post-without-validation" is highlighted.
o Press "X" to enable that option.
o Press "E" to exit configuration mode.
o Press "Y" to save the modified configuration.

That should speed things up somewhat.

Reference PC Pine for Windoze version 3.91.

1.  In the setup for PC pine, it should be clearer that 
inbox needs {imapserver.domain}inbox.  I suggest that if it's not
set, that it default to sendmail relay host. (I bet there aren't a 
lot of places that use a different relay host from the machine running
imapd.)

2.  Folder collections don't seem to be able to take IMAP'd collections.
E.g. The following doesn't work.
folder-collections  = c:\mail
                      {mailhub.aardvark.com}~/mail

This is a real inconvenience, as users won't be at the same machine
all the time. At present goto works for this, but I've yet to figure
out a way to get a list of my unix based message folders.

3.  For use in the goto, it would be convenient if there was some
abbreviation for your imap host. E.g. go to $sent-mail, the $ would
stand for whatever imap host had your mailbox.

4.  Export needs to be able to export either on the remote machine
or on the local machine.  Similarly for import in editing.  These
would both be tricky.

HI,

i guess you could only use the mark option when composing a mail.  To 
edit parts of your email messages, try forwarding it to yourself.  This 
brings up the original mail in edit mode, then you can use the mark 
option to chop out parts.

Get pine version >= 3.92 and mark the enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation feature

hi!
Well, I used tin to delete. I deleted the groups by pattern using tin.
They will be automatically deleted from your pine session.
I did.

    Maybe I have all along been missing something that has been staring
me right in the face, but in all the time I have been using Un*x Pine,
I have not found a way to convert back to 8-bit characters those
characters that come in a quoted-printable form in email or news, for
example, =AF or =B3 or whatever in the text.

    With my particular hardware and software setup (I am using Un*x
Pine 3.93 as part of the software), I can display full 8-bit characters
in any one of the ISO-8859-x character sets.  Some newsgroups and even
some mailing lists send full 8-bit characters, and I see them
appropriately.  However, sometimes characters come in already in
quoted-printable form.  If possible, I would like Pine to turn those
=XX forms back into 8-bit characters so I can view them properly.

    Does anybody know how this can be done?  Have I been missing
something all along?

As far as I know pine is 8 bits? (Maybe except the header)

(Sorry I don't reply to the original message but I didn't see this 
question until now)

I'm using pine 3.91 for unix, and I have no problems with 8bit characters.

But it might depend on telnet and what telnetprogram you are using.
try configure your telnetprgram for 8bit charachters.

Instead of telnet you may also use rlogin <hostname> -l <username> 

(these things depends on how you use the unix system, if you log in from 
a remote machine, fex a PC with telnet, or if you are directly on the 
unix machine.

I read the clarinet news  groups using pine. On some articles (I think 
ones with pictures attached) i'm prompted to 'use mime display [y/n]'(or 
something similar).

When I hit Y it comes up with an error message about 'metamail not 
found',  does not display the picture but does go on to  display any test 
in the article.

Can someone let me know what this means and what i need to do to fix it?

Thanks, 

Ps  - can you copy me any replies by email as my news feed isnt always 100%.

I am trying to correct a problem with replying to a dumb mailer. When I 
try to reply from Pine I get the text Warning: No addresses to reply to!
Is there something I need to change in the pine.conf? I can get this to 
work with elm ok.
Also I notice with this particular dumb mailer the second From: area is 
completely missing.
Any help appreciated.
Thanks!

newsgroup on your news server (including those you have "Deleted"
previously) use the "&" (Unexclude) command. 

If you want to hide "deleted" articles without leaving and returning to
the newsgroups use the opposite command: "X" (Exclude).

You may also find the Tab command useful, which advances to the next New
or Recent message.

All this, and more, is explained in Pine's main help section: "?" at the
Main Menu.  Look down for "Reading News" (or go there fast by using the
"W" command to search for the string "Reading News").

Cheers,

Hi!
If this is in a FAQ, please forgive me.
Is there a way to change a default editor to something else (i.e. emacs)?
I changes it in my .pinerc, but I have to use "^-_" to start it.
Please reply me by email if you can.

Thanks a lot.

You don't mention which version of Pine you are using (it always helps to
say, as later versions of any software have different features!)...

It sounds like you have managed to set up the "alternate editor" command
(you mention using ^_ to start the editor), but actually want the thing to
be started automatically to edit your message text.

Assuming you are using version 3.93 (which is the current version) go to
the Setup Configuration screen (at the Main Menu type S then C) then
enable the feature entitled:
	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

You can see helpful information about this, and any other configuration
option, by putting your cursor on the item and typing a "?".

Cheers,

Hello, 

Can anyone tell me if there is a way to block mails from coming from a 
certain address. For instance, if I don't want to get any emails from
the address abc@def.ghi.edu, the mails will be bounced back to "abc" 
whenever "abc" sends me emails.

Thanks in advance.

Gary.

I have not been able to find a way to change my "reply to" address.  If
anyone knows how, I would appreciate your telling me.  If there is
currently no way to do that, I would recommend that that be a future
addition to pine.  I know of at least one person already who has had to
stop using pine and start using emacs to compose his email because he was
also unable to find a way to change the "reply to."

Thanks much.

Paul,
If you see raw quoted-printable, it means Pine doesn't think this is a
MIME message --perhaps because a gateway or listserv corrupted the msg
in some way (e.g. stripped the MIME header out.)

In other words, Q-P decoding should be completely transparent, as long
as it is a syntactically correct MIME msg.

It seems likely that Pine is not recognising the address that the sender
put into his To: field as you; may be you (like me) have a number of
possibilities, or your normal To: differs from your normal From:.

To cure this put entries into the alt-addresses field in config.

I am sorry if this has already been covered.  I have read most of the 
messages in this newsgroup and don't remember.  So if it has been covered 
then just point me to the right place.

When using Pine 3.93 in the composer my typing starts at the bottom of 
the screen, instead of the top, and will typeover what I have just 
typed.  This leaves me with no way to write a message.  If anyone knows 
what the problem could possibly be I would be very happy.  I am using Unix.

Another question:

Is there a way to specify an Fcc folder for a news group so that it will 
be the default and I won't have to keep writing it in?

HWorking at helpdesks, we have been wanting people to send in their 
request forms using pine. 
I would like to convert forms/charts into templates(files) that can be 
(Read) inserted in message text.  Do I need to put these files in each user's
home directory or can I put into the parent directory?  If the latter, 
Can we set up a short default path/filename(f1, f2 etc.) and novice 
pine users can easily read in files? We are using using pine 3.9 with Unix
shell. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Yes, it's about a 10 or 20 part recipe..

You will be presented with a list of fifty zillion totally
incomprehensible terms.

Look for this entry:   enable-aggregate-command-set  

Mark that entry.

Exit the config subset of the setup subset and choose "yes" or whatever it
is that asks you about saving the configuration.

Execute the magic keystroke sequence to get you into the newsgroup which
has the thousands of messages.  

Press the semicolon key ;

(Note.....  it must be the lower-case thing)

Press the following sequence of keys on your keyboard:   aadd

At this point all messages should be marked for deletion.  If they are
not, then something is wrong in my instructions and you should go home and
cry over the lack of clearly understandable terms which is so widespread
and pervasive in pine specifically and unix in general.

Go to another newsgroup.

The  ";aadd" thing (without quotes) should work on that newsgroup also.

Press whatever magic secret keystroke sequence it is on your machine that
causes your machine to exit pine.

Sometimes pine will ask you if you really want to "expunge" (or whatever
word is configured for that day of the week) all the messages in some
specific newsgroup.  Other times, pine will not.  The rules for this are
hidden in a secret vault located in the deep tectonic ridge in the middle 
of the Pacific Ocean.

If the question does appear, answer yes.  (Or "Y" or "y" or whatever is
proper for the given phase of the moon during which you are operating.)

If the above rules are followed, there is an 86.703% statistical
probability that the messages you chose for deletion will go away.

I do not see how in this world you, or anyone else for that matter, could
be so obviously stupid-or-unfit-for-your-job as to not be able to discern,
easily and immediately, these blatantly obvious and simple steps.

If Aesop was alive today, it would be "the emperor's new buzzwords"

Peter,
This is how it shows up when I look at my listing of messages:

234 May 24 Peter Jaeckel      Why is my address ``To: ...'' with pine 3.93 ? 
             ^     ^
you can see your name and not the news group name.

Subject: Wyse terminals, again


I know this is a FAQ, but after searching through the archives
I see that it is also a SAQ (Seldom Answered Question).

The problem:  Bad behavior on Wyse-50 terminals.  I was assigned
the task of giving email access to about 75 users on our net, with
a wide variety of levels of expertise and a wide variety of terminals.
I installed Pine, thinking it would do the job.  However (no surprise)
the people running on Wyse-50's are really unhappy.  I don't care if
the arrow keys don't work, but the screens are garbled, the highligting
is all over the screen, etc.  I read the FAQ's which said "Some problems
can be fixed with a proper TERMCAP entry", but of course they don't say
exactly WHAT the proper termcap entry for a Wyse-50 is.  Anybody have
any suggestions?  I've looked at every TERMCAP file I could lay my
hands on, to no avail.

Two more questions on the same topic:

What would it take to *fix* Pine to handle the older terminal types?
I would gladly donate some labor to this task.  Does anybody have a
clear idea what would need to be changed to fix this problem?

Failing that, are there any other easy-to-use email client programs
with a menu-structure and online help, which can actually deal with
Wyse terminals?

Again, sorry for bringing this old, old, topic up again.

I would be extremely grateful for any replies.

Subject: Can Save transfer from one mail host to another?
Message-Id: <DsFG17.8u3@udcf.gla.ac.uk>
Date: Mon, 3 Jun 1996 13:55:54 GMT

I'd like to use PINE to transfer email(s) from a folder on
one mail host (say A), to a folder (with same or different name) 
on a different mail host (say B).

Is this possible in principle?  If so, how does the syntax
look for the destination folder on the other host?

All that I have succeeded in achieving so far is creating
some bizarrely-named mail folders on the same host that the
mail is starting from.  I'm a little worried that it might
not be possible at all, judging from the prompt -

  SAVE to folder in <mail/[] on foo.bar.baz> [saved-messages] : 

(where "foo.bar.baz" is the system on which the mail is 
currently sitting, i.e A in the above question).

If it makes any difference, I'm quite happy to log on to A
or to B and run PINE there.  I'm not necessarily trying to do
this from a third host, C!!!  I just want to move these mail
items from one set of mail folders to another.

p.s one of the systems has to be PINE 3.91, as I don't have
a newer version available for it.  If this is an issue.

many thanks

I do not think pine can automatically forward the incoming mail. 

Anyway you can try the following

1) if your are in a unix machine:

   put a file with the name .forward in your home directory.  If this
file exists, sendmail redirects your mail to the list of recipients in
the .forward file.

   For example, if you has a .forward file containing:

        jd@company.com
        

     sendmail will redirect all incoming messages  to
     ``jd@company.com'', 

2) if you are in a vms machine use the 
  SET FORWARD command inside the mail utility. For example 
  SET FORWARD NEXUS::LARS will redirec your mail towards NEXUS::LARS.


I hope this help

Hi Terry !

Thanks for your Answer !
You asked for more information about the PCPine-Problem :

I store my UNIX-folder with the extension "MTX", so they are visible in 
Pine's folderlist.
When I chose the command "Add folder" I get the message "Folder XY 
created", and in fact, there is a new file on my harddisc called XY.MTX, 
but it is 0 Bytes long (Is this correct ?).
When I try to go into this folder, I get the error "Not a folder".
Then I tried to go around this problem by saving messages to this 
new folder, but there's also an error occuring : "Indeterminate 
mailbox-format".

Is it possible that I have to install the Microsoft Network ?
Or have I to make any changes in the SYSTEM.INI ?
Maybe PCPine does fileread and filewrite over the network-driver ?
(The filemanager gives an network-like error when I try to open a folder 
which is opened by pine at the same time.)

 Apparently my "/var/spool/mail/" file is now
 corrupt since the error message upon starting Pine 3.93
 (Linux) is:

  "inbox is not in proper mail format."

 I've had no problems prior to this and I'm using
 a single user system, and no files are changed unless
 I change them...<g>.
 
 Now what?

Hi, pine users!

Is it possible to force a folder to be in a specific format? What I mean
is following:

  the Pine include long list of mailbox drivers for different formats.
  No suppose I go in folder menu and create new folder. How can I say,
  that I want this folder to be in, e.g., TENEX format instead of
  mbox?

  The same question if I S)ave or Fcc message - is it possible to force
  new folder to be in specific format?

thanks in advance

Yes, a newly created folder should be 0 bytes long.

I'm confused.  Do you have two files with the name XY?

Both of these error messages indicate that the file is not really empty.
Please take a close look at the error message; you should find the file
name in there.

Subject: displayfilter in Solaris 2.4
Date: 4 Jun 1996 04:17:02 GMT
Message-Id: <4p0dbu$egm@babyblue.cs.yale.edu>

 I found a really strange problem in Pine 3.93 under
Solaris 2.4. I wrote a simple filter to decode 
ISO-2022-KR(7bit) encoded Korean mail back to EUC-KR
(KSC 5601:8bit) and set it as a displayfilter
( "" /full/path/myfilter). It worked very well
under Linux 2.0pre6 and AIX 4.x, but under Solaris 2.4,
it gives me following error messages , the first of
which appears when I try to display the
message and the 2nd of which appears at the end
of 'decoded'(filtered. yes, filter works even with error
messages) message after I hit [return]. 


---------
Pipe command returned error.  Hit return to continue.

[Error: Formatting error: Pipe command returned error.] 
-------------

  Since I know that 'stty' and other terminal related
commands in shell start-up file can be causes of problem,
I removed(well, backed up) all of them(.tcshrc,.cshrc, 
.bashrc,and even irrelvant .login and .profile), but
I get the same error.  More strange is 
'mmencode' works well under Solaris if set as 
displayfilter. Hence, I wonder if there's any
condition to be satisfied by 'filter' other than
that it accepts standard input and writes to standard output.

  On all three platforms, I used binaries available
at ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin.

  For your reference, my filter, "hmconv" is available
at ftp://ftp.korea.stanford.edu/incoming/upload9604/hmconv.c

  I would be greatly obliged to anyone who can enlighten me
on this issue.

If a user has two personal names (Prof. A. Jones when writing to students
and Alan Jones when writing to a colleagues) is there a simple way to
change the From: field without having to change the config setup. At
present I copied .pinerc to .pinercb, changed the personal name inside,
and then using an alias I run pine -p pinercb to allow use of the
secondary name in the From field. 

Perhaps a later version will allow this feature in the Compose mode (I'm
using 3.93).

	My brother is using Pine in India and wants an idea of online 
command arguments in order to write scripts. Any idea where I can find 
such info? What are the file names? I have alreadt visited the ftp site 
but did not find the right stuff.

Well, to me this is starting to become a Frequently Answered Question :-)

To try to determine what your problems are, it is essential to know 
what your environment looks like. So, could you please tell:

- What version of Pine you are using
- For which system you are building it

This could answer if you are using terminfo instead of termcap, in which
case another Wyse 50 tic source might help. 

Also, Pine versions 3.92 and up do have keyboard support for Wyse like
terminals with a proper termcap / terminfo (ahem..), but this does require
a configuration change prior to building it.

I'll be happy to try to help you, but please supply some more info first.

Is there anywhere a working PINE for VMS version available? I got the 
version 3.91 but this distribution only builds PICO but for the C-Client 
and PINE some files are missing.

Could anyone help me please?

I'm using Pine 3.90 under Linux.

Whenever I enter a value for read-message-folder, it doesn't work as it 
should and I get the following error on exit:

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.

Any advice much appreciated.

I'd like to upgrade 3.90, so I grabbed 3.93 (pine-bin.linux) and 
couldn't help noticing that it's a 3.8MB executable. I'm not going to 
fire up this program without knowing what it's going to do. Is it a 
self-install? Anyone know? (I'm using Linux 1.2.13.)

Thanks!

It only looks that way to you because _you_ sent it. If you go to your
sentmail folder, you'll see that _all_ outgoing email from you looks that
way.  It looks completely normal to the rest of us.

Easy enough, huh?...laters...

Whoa, guys, I've seen various answers here, and I think maybe S. Lanyon
may be being misread, not careless. I'm here for what is likely the same
question. I *HAVE* enabled full headers through Configuration. My problem
is that "full headers" doesn't include the *complete* path of a received
message. What I'm needing right now is the info on the full path that the
message followed. I know that some people's mail programs have that info,
plus the time that the mail was actually sent, not just the time it was
received at my local host. I'm running Pine 3.91. Someone has indicated
to me that perhaps this feature is available on 3.93 and that I'd have to
try to exit Pine and edit my mail folder to get the *complete* header
info in 3.91. Unfortunately, I know how to edit mail files outside of
pine, but I don't know what I'd have to do to a Mail folder to get that
info. For all I know, this may even be a problem related to the system
here at my institution--perhaps they have set it up so as not to display
all the info for an incoming message if full header mode--just the local
machine info. 

I've read helpfiles and archives and updates and tried to find this info
in a FAQ, and I'm stymied. Anybody got an answer?

  I like 'displayfilter' added in Pine 3.92 or later very much and
I think it would be nice to have 'printfilter' as well.
I'm aware that alternative print command can be used, 
but 'printfilter' can be handy if one uses Pine on
remote host via dial-up connection(just Unix shell access) and
wants to print out with a printer attached to a local 
computer(print via 'attached ANSI'). In that case, command like
'filter | lpr' doesn't work and need for 'printfilter' 
arises. It'd be also nice if one can specify more than one
printer filter and is prompted for selection.

Which reminds me, why does pine use Q-P in its folder format? I sometimes
use "less" to browse through a saved mail folder, and it would be more
useful to have the folder in 8bit format, even if the original message
was received as Q-P. Nowadays this is becoming less of an issue for me
as our sendmail already converts incoming Q-P messages, but my sent-mail
folders still contain Q-P.

Greetings,
rjan.

Well, here is one way of doing it.
Declare a folder collection on the target system. Quit and reenter if
necessary (which will at some point cause you to quuote the password for
the target system).

select the individual or group of messages to be Saved, but instead of
responding to the prompt us the "To Folders" option (^T), move to the
relevant collection, give a name, and it will all happen.

Funny you should ask, as I just had to do this.  The fix to my problem was
two things:

1) In pine/makefile.xxx and pico/makefile.xxx (where xxx is sv4 or whatever
your system is) on the STDCFLAGS line add -DTERMCAP_WINS and this will make
the arrow keys work on the Wyse terminals.  Be advised that they will have
to use the "Delete" key for deleting characters because "Backspace" is the
exact same control sequence as the left arrow key.  Also, because ^K is the
up arrow key, you will have to use the Esc-Esc-K equivalent for "Cut Text".
My makefile line looked like:

STDCFLAGS=      -Dsv4 -DPOSIX -DJOB_CONTROL -DTERMCAP_WINS

2) I also had weird (what looked like) termcap problems, but what it turned
out to be was that pine & pico were swallowing the XON/XOFF characters, and
thus screwing up the display to varying degrees. What I had to do to fix it
was in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf I added to the "feature-list" line the
preserve-start-stop-characters and assume-slow-link options, and that fixed
up the Wyse terminals nicely. My pine.conf line looked like:

feature-list= preserve-start-stop-characters, assume-slow-link

After re-building with the new makefile options, and the new options in the
pine.conf file, everything now works great!  As a final sidebar, if you are
trying to build pine3.93 on a pyramid running dcosx, make sure you have the
latest cc from pyramid (4.0 I think), otherwise you're in for SEGV city ;-)

FWIW,

Does anyone know how to show the size (in bytes) of messages in a newsgroup ?
I have set index-format to "STATUS MSGNO FROM SIZE SUBJECT", but Pine only
shows the message size when I'm reading my incoming folders.

Is this a bug of some sort or are there some Pine flags which I'm currently
unaware of %-)

Thanks in advance,

Vladimir,

Thanks for the info. I don't have the right software, yet this 
information will come in handy in the near future.

I didn't see anything in the config screen (in 3.91) where you can send a 
message without confirming.  Does anyone know if there is a way to do this?

Thanks in advance!!!

tin is a Unix newsreader. I use it to read /respond to the newsgroups in

Like the rest  of the unix world (to an outsider , at least) it has its 
share of odd features - but once you get used to it its fine.

For me the major advantage over Pine is the way it groups postings and 
responses in 'threads' so you can quickly follow or skip all the posts on 
a particular subject.

Hope that helps..

Let's see... On my Linux 1.2.13 system the Pine executable I just built
(bin/pine) is sized 5136382 bytes. That's 4.89Mb. I win! :-) 

I don't know if the pine-bin.linux you downloaded is self extracting or
not (where did you get it from?), but it could very well just be a pine
binary with some debug symbol leftovers. Try to run "strip" on it and see
if it shrinks. Over here, this will reduce the size of the binary to 1.6Mb.

Your real question is: "Why doesn't Pine rewrite folders to convert Q-P to
8bit"?

The answer is that we think it's morally wrong to tamper with message
internals.   We leave it in the same text that it arrived.

If you have been using the searchable full-text index of the Pine
Discussion Forum archives on the World Wide Web -- 

URL:   http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/ 

-- to search for previous discourse on a topic of interest, you may have
found that your query retrieved many messages of little relevance to the
subject.  For example, your query on "PGP" ("pretty good privacy" 
encryption) might have retrieved a message that has nothing to do with that
topic, but contained a 'signature' with the message sender's PGP key. 

To overcome that problem, the WWW Pine Discussion Forum archives now
include a searchable index of ONLY the subject lines of messages (based on
the assumption that the subject line adequately summarizes most messages'
content). 

On the page at the aforementioned URL, you will now find two "search" 
links: one for the familiar full-text index, and a new one (below it) for
the subject-line-only index.  If you encounter any problems with, or have
comments about, this new feature, please write to: PIC@cac.washington.edu

Orjan,
While I agree with Mark that an MUA shouldn't modify the CTE of messages
in incoming mailboxes, I'd like to add a comment regarding outgoing
(sent-mail) folders: We've found that it's *really* handy to have in
the sent-mail folder an exact copy of the message as given to the MTA.

I believe that if you use a modern sendmail and a recent Pine with
8BITMIME negotiation enabled, you will have what you want in your
sent-mail folder.

    Pine does not have killfile capability.  For incoming email (at
least on Un*x systems), you can set up a mail filtering program such as
procmail or (Elm) filter to preprocess (and discard, if you want) mail
messages.  For newsgroups, I have never heard of anything that works
with Pine.

Sherwood,
Folder collections most assuredly do work with IMAP servers, but do
look at the help text for the folder-collections variable, as the syntax
is non-obvious.  In your example, you would need:

 folder-collections= c:\mail\[],
                     {mailhub.aardvark.com}mail/[]

Once you have these working, then your GOTO problem should also be solved,
since you can then use ^p or ^n to select the collection you want.

     Check out the `customized-hdrs' and `default-composer-hdrs' options 
in the Pine Setup.  Basically `customized-hdrs=Reply-to:you@here' will 
change your default reply to address [replace you@here with the e-mail 
address that you wish to use.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=iso-8859-1

Hi,

I just installed the 3.93 version of pine and have been very pleased to
read that it support x functionalities.

I can verify that it was the case for
	enable-newmail-in-xterm-icon

But for enable-mouse-in-xterm, I couldn't notice nothing new.
The explanation in the help is not sufficient for me to understand what I
can gain.
 
This feature controls whether or not an X terminal mouse can be used with
Pine.  If set, and the $DISPLAY variable indicates that an X terminal is
being used, the left mouse button on the mouse can be used to select text
or commands. 
 
Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of X terminal cut-and-paste is
also modified.  It is necessary to hold the shift key down while clicking
left or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.
 

I have the impression that discussion took place around cut&paste, sorry
to raise again this issue, but what I read is not sufficient for me.

More specifically, can anybody tell how I can "select commands" ?

I would like to know if something is not wrong in the installation here.


Thank you for any type of help

Jean

Some users on our machine are running into this problem.  If they quit
suddenly (e.g., turning computer off), pine then becomes a runaway process
invisible to the use (see example below)--unless they run "ps -aux".  The
runaway process then deletes (so it appears, I have not been able to
confirm that yet) the user's mail as it arrives.  Is there something wrong
with the way pine was installed on our system?  I've used pine on many
machines and it's only at Rutgers that I noticed this problem.

	Sure: write to the sender to say that (s)he should be
using pine 3.93 with Lcc: in the default headers, and putting
the nickname for that list into it!

Pine users:

Is there any way to not display the entire list of recipients when 
reading mail on Pine 3.92? Most of our messages have 2 pages worth of 
Recipients, so we have to page forward to get to the message (which is 
usually much short than the recipient list).

Thanks in advance,

Eberto

Hi all...

I have a problem sending mail remotely using Pine- if i am rlogged in to 
my terminal and try sending mail thru Pine, I get an erro.  can do 
everything else- read mail, file it, etc... 
Is this a Pine problem or a configuration problem or a system problem ?

I'm using Pine-3.93, btw.

Thanks !

..Hrishi

That's true if your sendmail handles 8bit characters correctly. But you will
not be able to use 8bit characters in mail headers - e.g. the subject 
header - without using pine version >= 3.92.

: But it might depend on telnet and what telnetprogram you are using.

And when you reply to such a message, edit out the control characters so
your reply doesn't do the same damage you're cautioning against!  :-)

These control characters are a real pain.  Shouldn't Pine display them
as \xXX escape sequences or something, instead of sending them
straight to the terminal?

What do the Pine developers say?

    If you have a World Wide Web browser, browse my home page and
follow the link on mail filtering and such to Nancy McGough's pages. 
She has a great deal of good, useful material on mail filtering.

I had just the same problem. Fact is, Pine defaults to showing a FROMORTO field
in your message index, instead of a FROM field. Every message you sent is thus
marked with the "To:" field instead of your own name.

You can change this by setting
   index-format=STATUS MSGNO DATE FROM(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)
in your Pine configuration.

Hope this helps

     Thanks, I was just about to ask the same question.  So, why does
Pine act this way?  Is the intentional or just a weird behavior?

Hi all,

 how can I change the from header with pine? I use a ppp account, and
  my address is not the same always. I use right now reply-to header,
  but some people don't use it, so I don't get replies..
 when I tried to change the from header with cutomized-hdrs in .pinerc
  pine didnt let me (it refuses to change the from header).
 can I fix it? please e-mail me.

Thanks,
Shay.

Yes, Pine's behaviour *is* intentional, to present you with the maximum
amount of information within the space available.

I believe the thought pattern goes domething like this:

*  When someone sends you a message it is most useful to see who it is
   _from_ in the Index.

*  For messages you _send_ there is little to be gained from putting the
   sender's (your own) e-mail address in the Index:

      -  The presence of your name in the Index list merely shows the
         message was sent by yourself.

      -  There is no indication as to whether the message was one you sent
         to yourself (eg, to remind you to do something the next day), or
         just CC'd to yourself?

*  Instead how about displaying who the message was sent _to_ in the
   Index?

      +  The presence of the "To:" prefix shows the message was sent by
         yourself.

      +  You also get to see who the message was sent _to_.

So you benefit by getting more information conveyed to you through the
Index listing.  (Just remember that if you see a "To:" prefix it means you
sent this message ... should be obvious, huh? :-)

1.  No versions of Pine yet support killfiles.

2.  The current version of Pine is 3.93; you should look at upgrading to
    that or the nearing Pine 3.94 in order to take advantage of bug fixes
    and many improvements.

This is not something that is controllable vie command line or
configuration file options.

Instead you will need to make a change to the source code and recompile
Pine.

Go to the pine/osdep/ directory and edit the os-XXX.h file for your
platform.  Look through it for a commented out line saying:

/* #define ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM  /* comment out to not allow changing From */

Uncomment the line, then recompile Pine.

Not much that you can do once such a message has been received.

Instead, however, help everybody the message goes to by contacting the
sender and suggesting they start using the "Bcc" field to enter the list
of recipients rather than the "To:" field.

Hint #1: Make sure a valid "To:" field is still given -- either their own
e-mail address or something magical like this "Recipient List:;" (it's the
":;" that's magical).

Hint #2: If they're using Pine AND are sending to a distribution list in
their Address Book THEN use the "Lcc" field instead of "Bcc".  (The main
difference is that the name of the list will be copied from the Lcc field
to the To field along with the magical ":;".)

Hint #3: With Pine you can get to see/use the Bcc and Lcc fields by:
starting to compose your message, put the cursor on any header field,
typing ^R.

Cheers,

(I'm constantly amazed by how unadventurous or unobservant some people
are... :-)

1.  At the Main Menu type "L" to go to the Folder List screen.
    (This lists your folders(!) and lets you open/manipulate them.)

2.  Move the highlight onto the folder in question.

3.  Gaze thoughtfully at the command menu at the bottom of the screen:

    ? Help       M Main Menu  P PrevFldr   - PrevPage D Delete R Rename
    O OTHER CMDS V [ViewFldr] N NextFldr Spc NextPage A Add    ^^^^^^^^

    ("Gosh! I wonder what that 'Rename' command does!" ;-)

Admittedly this is slightly less intuitive in the first instance...

0.  (A once and for all step).  At the Main Menu go to the Setup
    Configuration screen by typing "S" then "C".  Look down the list of
    options and make sure "enable-aggregate-command-set" is selected (we
    configure Pine so that this is the systemwide default).

1.  Go to the Folder Index screen, which summarises the messages in your
    folder.

2.  Use the Select (;) command to choose an appropriate set of messages.
    Eg, ";A" will select all messages.

3.  Apply a command to the selected set using the Apply (A) command.
    Eg, "AS" will apply a Save command to every selected message, allowing
    you to move them en bloc to another folder.

Hint: As well as Select (;) and Apply (A) there is also Zoom (Z), which
temporarily hides all unselected messages from the Index listing.  A
second Zoom will include them again.

Cheers,

There is no way of us knowing until you share the exact wording of the
error message with us (and when it occurs: immediately you type ^X?
returned to you as an e-mail a few minutes after you sent your message?)

Pine 3.92 and later suppress them in the message's body (unless you have
the "pass-control-characters-as-is" set).

However they weren't detected/suppressed from the Subject text.

I reported this as a Bug (using Pine's very handy Bug (B) command) a few
days ago after getting fed up with having my terminal set into bold all
the time by replies to the "Newsgroups & Pine" thread.

They quickly acknowledged my report and indicated it will be fixed in Pine
3.94.

As you might be able to see in this message, your e-mail address on
outgoing messages (and presumably interpreted by Pine) is
"caron@jade.jouy.inra.fr".

However in the message you quote the To line is to "caron@jouy.inra.fr"

Without assistance Pine has no way of knowing that these two machines --
jade.jouy.inra.fr and jouy.inra.fr -- are one and the same (at least as
far as mail is concerned).

Some things for you to try changing in the Setup Configuration screen (S
then C from the Main Menu)...


1.  Set "use-only-domain-name" to "Yes".  This strips off the current host
name (jade) from the fully qualified domain leaving just "jouy.inra.fr".

Check whether this has worked:

A.  The Index screen should show a "+" at the extreme left hand side of
the line summarising your message.

B.  When you start a Reply (there's no need to actually send it) you
should NOT be prompted whether you want to reply to all recipients.


2.  If this didn't work, try setting the value back to "No".  Now try
setting the "user-domain" variable to "jouy.inra.fr".

Check whether this has now worked.


3.  If it hasn't then resort to persuading Pine you are known by other
e-mail addresses too (set up the "alt-addresses" variable with a list of
your (full) other e-mail addresses).


Cheers,

No, I don't. There are some folders in my directory and I create a new 
one called XY. A folder called XY doesn't exist at this moment.

The name is correct: "D:/Daten/Mail/XY" and when I observe the folders 
with Windows' filemanager or from the DOS-prompt, the file is listed with 
0 Bytes.
Very confusing...

This is a limitation fo current versions of Pine.  Pine is not able to
determine message size accurately or quickly and therefore does not
display it...

ftp.novell.co.uk/pub/unixware/freebird/pine

Give it a try, it works with no problems

Hi!

Our sysop just installed 3.93 on our unix lan, and I noticed something I
don't like very much.  Maybe someone can help me to get back things like
they used to be in 3.92? ;-)

What happens is that, for the letters _I_ post only, the FROM: field in
the index of the newsgroup is changed into the TO: field.  Here's an
example:

      4 Jun  5 To: ott.general,mtl.g Re: Doug Young
      5 Jun  5 To: Martin Ramshaw    Re: Doug Young
      6 Jun  5 Daniel A. Szpiro      Re: Doug Young
      7 Jun  5 Elie Charest          Re: Doug Young

As you see above, messages number 4 and 5 are mine, number 6 and 7 aren't.
What I awaited to see is:

      4 Jun  5 Patrick Dery          Re: Doug Young
      5 Jun  5 Patrick Dery          Re: Doug Young
      6 Jun  5 Daniel A. Szpiro      Re: Doug Young
      7 Jun  5 Elie Charest          Re: Doug Young

Any idea?  I played with the "view header" thing in the config menu, but
without success.  

Thanks!

I have browsed this newsgroups backlogs and searched for a way to easily
incorporate pgp into pine via the send filters, but I haven't seen an easy
way.

Could someone post the best way to do this?

Is there an easy way to transfer one's *IX* Pine393 mail folders for use
with PCPine3.93?

I ftp'd several folders to my PC mail directory.  PCPine3.93 detects the
folders but marks them as being READONLY -- hence no maintenance on the PC
folder is allowed.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.

Yes- it is immediately after I do ^X - there is a funny beep, and it
simply says "Error sending". I CAN send mail directly from the command
line so I dont think its an SMTP server problem...

Thanks.

For those of us who keep large amounts of correspondence - who could
use nested (contained-in-more-contained...) folders:  any hope soon?

Or is it to extract and take it off PINE?  /But Emacs perhaps....

Definitely planned... maybe even in the next major release (4.0x)
In the mean time you can create folder collections that are actually
subdirectories of your main collection  --not ideal, but perhaps useful
in the interim.

in order to forward mail to new address you have to creat ".forward" file
in your root directory .
          write 
             pico .forward
       after that write following lines in that file for example you want to
    forward me you all mail so you includea line like.

             advise05@rorqual.cc.metu.edu.tr
   hope you will get right result.

I may be wrong but it could be something with your system.  I am using 
pine 3.91 to read this group and when I display the full header the path 
is as follows for this group of messages:

Path:
fnnews.fnal.gov!uwm.edu!math.ohio-state.edu!howland.reston.ans.net!newsfeed.inte
rnetmci.com!vixen.cso.uiuc.edu!usenet.ucs.indiana.edu!not-for-mail

so maybe you can look at the path your system gives for the same messages.
I hope this helped at least a little.

I have been testing PCPine for Windows today.  I am trying to determine
the limitations.

My platform is a 486/33 with 8MB memory -- plenty of disk space available.
The system appears to hang when I have a large INBOX.  My first tests were
226 messages - 3.5MB INBOX.  My last test was over two hundred mail
messages but the INBOX size was 677K.

Any suggestions?  More memory??

Thanks in advance.

Does anyone know of a modification of pine which allows offline 
reading/writing?

Also if my company wanted to give pine this capability, where would
we hire a freelance programmer capable of this ?

Thank You

Hi all!

I have many printers at my location. Is there a way to make pine ask for 
a printer name instead of scrolling through all of the defined printers?

I tried to write a shell script that would prompt for the printer name, 
but I can't get it to work.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

If you can get your hands on a book from O'Rielly & Associates, the

There is a pine feature called "print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt" which you
should turn on.

Asim,
Offline operation (and later, disconnected operation as well) is
definitely planned, and is a high priority for us.

It won't be in the first 4.0x release, but I hope one soon after that.

It occured to me that there are some cases where decoding might be
dangerous, like "=46rom ". I still think it is ugly. Imagine how much
simpler all this would be if files had been based on recursive lists of
bytes rather than a flat string where division markers cannot be reliably
distinguished from the text itself.

Possibly. At the moment my situation is that I have Pine 3.93 on all
my accounts except the one with 8BITMIME sendmail, so I haven't tested
that yet.

Can somone tell me if there is an easier way to save e-mail messages so I 
can download them to my computer.  I am just using a regular Unix 
account, text-based.

In Pine, I can press E to export 1 message into my directory for later 
downloading.  But I have to type the filename each time.  It is a lot of 
work to do that for 10 or 20 messages.  Is there anyway I can save a 
whole bunch of messages?  Just tag off whichever ones I want to save and 
use one command to save them all?  Must be some way.

I would like to suggest a possible workaround for the remote addressbook
issue, which is a big issue at our site as well:

What about changing the addressbook format to that of a standard mail
folder with dummy headers at the top, then standard addressbook format
below?  This would permit remote addressbooks using the folder operations
that IMAP already knows about, without having to wait for someone to
finish implementing an all-new protocol.

PINE could be programmed to:

1.	Keep that folder in the usual folder-collections directory, i.e.,
	mail/[], or even a local folder if the user preferred

2.	Not show that folder in the list of available folders, since it
	is a "special" folder

3.	Prohibit the user from creating his/her own folder called "addrbook"
	(though few users would be likely to do this)

The first time such a version of PINE were run, it would copy any
existing addressbook data to the new addrbook folder.

Thoughts?  I might be willing to volunteer for this programming task
if the CAC guys are interested, and if they think it will be a while until
the newer remote-addressbook-capable protocol(s) and associated version(s)
of PINE appear.

Malcolm,
On more than one occasion, we have discussed the possibility of using
IMAP or FTP to access a remote addressbook, as an interim solution until
ACAP is ready for prime-time.  Indeed, the UW IMAP server can already
present an arbitrary file as a MIME attachment to a pseudo-message...

The thing that has usually quenched that idea is the realization that 
we wouldn't have a good way to provide full read-write access with
appropriate safeguards against multiple sessions smashing addrbk data.
Also we still hold the view that the "correct" (ACAP) solution is just
around the corner... :)

We've definitely learned that people get cranky if they don't have
write-access to their address book: in a recent PC-Pine version we had
a bug that made addressbooks accessed via a remote filesystem protocol
read-only, and campers were not happy...

One possibility for an interim solution in the *Unix* Pine context where
NFS access is not available would be to put a wrapper around Pine that did
an rcp of the addressbook.  For PC-Pine users, we have some folks using
SMB (the Microsoft remote file access protocol) to get at address books
stored on Unix servers, but not everyone can use that solution.

I started out with a pine 3.93 binary that was about 3.8M and it stripped
down just as you describe.

This is another question that I think is not possible but, I gotta ask.  
Is there a way, that when you receive a message from a person who is 
sending a message to a distribution list, so that you won't have to see 
all 100 and some other names that the message was sent to?

Once again, thanks in advance.

No, it is the actual program.

Hello all,

I would like to use pine as a news reader.  News arives at ibbs from
a UUCP link.  How can I get pine to act as a news reader?  I have 
played with the options and it still can't find the newsgroups.

Any ideas?

Speaking of headers is there any customization available for interpreting 
the incoming header?
Specifically the "From: "?
I have a problem on our internal SMTP gateway that it adds a line 
X-Status before the "From: " and pine is not able to read it so I get a 
message that says No Message Text in the index and No recipients to reply 
to when trying to reply.
Any ideas?
Thanks

I believe this must be fixed on the sending side.
If the sender is using Pine 3.92 or later, ask him/her to put the addresses in
the Lcc: field rather than the To: or Cc: field.

If the sender is using Pine 3.91 or earlier, or another mail program, ask
him/her to put the addresses in the Bcc: field, _and_ put something like this
in the To: field:

To: The Chosen Few : ;

(The : ; are important.)

It may be that whoever is sending to you is using the second method, but
without the second step.

Greetings,
rjan.

I have a accout with a login xtang, but I set up an alias called rxtang,

So incoming mail addressed to rxtang works fine, but I also want
outgoing mail to be addressed as From: rxtang as oppsed to From: xtang,
which is the default.

I know I can do this if I write raw smtp commands, but can I set it
up so that elm or pine does it??

Thanks, -Richard

Well, this has probably been answered before, but I hope someone
will be kind enough to answer it again for me. Feel free to e-mail
replies if it's been done to death in the newsgroup!

1) We just set up all of our staff with unix accounts for e-mail, using
Pine, of course. In the course of learning as much as possible about
Pine, I failed to consider printing, since I don't normally print me mail.
When I try to use the prYnt command, it seems to print, but I don't know
where. We're accessing the unix accounts via a telnet session over the
internet. The only thing I can think is that it is printing at the server site.
So the question is how to get it to print locally? 

2) This is more minor, but is there a way to tell Pine not to save a
particular out-going message in the sent-mail folder when you send
a message? Also, is there a way to disable the sent-mail saving
completely?

Thanks in advance for any and all help!
Mary

I assume you are speaking about Yehavi's free port from HUJI.
Take a look at my own experiences/notes at

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/vms-pine.html

and see whether they help you with your problems building the software
in your environment.  N.B I am no expert in this - I worked on it just
far enough to be able to use PINE as a transition aid in our VMS
environment.

Is there any way to have a global style addressbook containing  all
email user addresses on a Unix system appear when a user hits ^T on the 
"To" line when composing a message?  A modified /etc/passwd list would be 
a start.  Any idea's???

After exiting from newly installed 3.93, my telnet application EWAN (for Windows 3.1) doesn't display the last line of text from the shell.  This never happened with 3.91.  I don't see anything in the setup of either Pine or Ewan that could prevent this.  Anybody got any ideas?

    Sure.  I've changed the name of a folder several times, at least
under different versions of Un*x Pine.  Just remember that to the Un*x
file system, a Pine folder is merely any other file with an internal
structure that means something to the application (Pine) that maintains
it.  If you try to _edit_ a Pine folder you could mess something up,
but merely renaming it doesn't seem to hurt anything.  (At least, it
hasn't for me.)

    Simply quit completely from Pine.  From the shell prompt (assuming
you are using Un*x Pine), cd to the subdirectory in which Pine stores
its folders.  (Again, I am assuming that it is a local collection.)  In
my case it is just $HOME/mail.  Just rename it what you want.  When you
fire up Pine again, it should show up in the folder list under its new
name.  I did it just the other evening.

Hello,
If there is an answer to my question on a FAQ somewhere, please point me
to it.  I wish to be able to filter incoming mail into pre-chosen folders.  I
seem to remember (many months ago, the last time I was on this list) that pine
needed some additional software in order to be able to do this.
Thank you very much for you help.

Date: Fri, 07 Jun 1996 01:02:36 GMT
Message-Id: <4p80h9$jhr@news2.cais.com>


My company has an account with an ISP (BEST.COM) and it is set up so
that all the domain email is sent to one POP account.  You can send
messages to anyname@mydomain.com and they are all sent to that one pop
account. This is kind of neat because I can get all the mail for the
office at once without having to have a dedicated server or 50 pop
accounts at my ISP! 
Problems arise when people travel across the country and still want to
get their theirname@mydomain.com email forwarded to their
compuserve/aol/prodigy/whatever email.

 A simple .forward file will not suffice because it will forward
EVERYBODY'S email to that one person.

Q: Is there a way to set up a .forward file to forward mail to
individual boxes based on the name in the TO: field?

My server is using PINE 3.93, ELM 2.4, mailx, procmail...

Any responses would be appreciated! You can send them to me directly
at bschlank@pacificnet.net or here.

I once had a similar problem. What I did is wrote the list directly into the
addressbook. If you haven't changed the name, it is called .addressbook. It is 
just a plain text file, so you can edit it (with little care to preserve
the structure). Start creating list in pine, add 2 or three addresses, then
exit pine and start pico on .addressbook (or whatever you addresbook is called).
Find the place where you list starts, and include (^R in pico) your separate
file with the list you want
in there. Pay special attention to separators. Good luck

-Vladimir

PS You may want to save a copy of .addressbook before messing with it, 
just in case.

Hi !

Maybe I can solve my problem by converting the UNIX-like folkders to 
Pine-folders.
How can I do this ?
What's the difference between both formats ?

Thx in Advance,

- Mark

You can get even smaller binaries by compiling the source yourself:

| onyx:/usr/local/bin$uname -a
| Linux onyx 1.2.13 #23 Sun Mar 24 20:49:45 GMT+0100 1996 i586
| 
| onyx:/usr/local/bin$l pine
| -rwxr-xr-x   1 ezra     admin     1159172 Apr 13 12:49 pine*

>From pine/makefile.lnx :

| OPTIMIZE=    -O2 -s
| PROFILE=     # -pg
| DEBUG=       #-g -DDEBUG

Not that it matters that much any more with the current prices of hard
disks.

The behavior of the by-nick-of-from option in the saved-msg-name-rule
in the config menu of pine 3.93 is not what I would expect:

  if the from: field is in the .addressbook, pine saves to nickname: OK
  if the from: field is not in the .addressbook, pine saves in
  the default "saved-messages" folder, while I would expect it to save to
  name derived from the by-from option. Looks more intuitive
  Somehow the option should be named: by-nick-of-from-then-from

Before submitting a Bug report, I would like to be sure I am not
missing something.

Thanks for your collective help

This is a question about Pine 3.93 (16-bit) under Windows for Workgroups
3.11 and MS TCP. Every time I enter one of the following characters @ [ ]
{ } | ~   Pine switches the space key to function as "jump to beginning
of next word." I had the same problem with Pine 3.91. What those
characters have in common is that, to use them on a German keyboard, you
have to press the right Alt key when typing the actual character. Any
comments? Btw, the space bar can be switched back to normal functioning by
typing about any ctrl-character combination.

Is there a way to make Pine _not_ add the From: line?  The sendmail
program does this automatically if one does not already exist with the
appropriate name, hostname, etc., and I'd prefer it did, but I cannot
find an option to do this.  Is there one, and how do I use it?

Subject: Strange headers
Date: 07 Jun 1996 17:30:21 -0400
Message-Id: <rpvih3b8uq.fsf@musenet.org>

I am trying to compile Pine 3.93 for vax-ultrix to use the regular
sendmail procedure for sending mail, instead of connecting to the SMTP
server directly like it seems to want to do by default.  However, when
I provide a sendmail-path in the pine.conf, it adds this strange
second 'To' header that says 'Undisclosed recipients' (or something
along those lines), which causes sendmail to generate a MAILER-DAEMON
error.  The message gets sent, but each time this error results, which
makes Pine think the message has not been sent and leaves the sender
in the editor.

Can anyone assist me with this problem?  Many thanks.

There is no way to do this in Pine, although it can be done in the
low-level libraries used by Pine.  Other than the INBOX, there is no
general way to force alternate formats from Pine.

We recommend that, if you want to change the default folder format, that
you edit the c-client Makefile to set STDPROTO to something else (e.g.
tenexproto) and then rebuild Pine.

I have never used pc pine but what you want can be done very easily with 
pine on your shell and pegasus on your pc, both work very well together as 
pegasus gives you the option to remove mail from your shell after 
downloading or leave it there.
I use pine 70% of the time but messages I want to keep or reply to offline 
I pick up with pegasus.

Sending an attachment using Pine...

1.  Start your message (Compose, Reply, Forward, etc).

2.  Put cursor on the "Attchmnt:" header line at the top of the screen.

3.  Type ^G (Get help, as shown on menu at foot of screen).

4.  Read instructions.

Cheers,

First, a hint...

If you can see/find something in the Configuration screen use the Where
(W) command to search for a string, just as you can in a message or index
screen.

In particular doing a "W header" takes you straight to the option called
"enable-full-header-cmd".  (Then typing a "?" or "^G" displays help about
this feature.)

Having turned on this option you can then use the now-available "H"
command when viewing a message (or in the Index screen).

Cheers,

    It may not be _exactly_ what you want, but you can download an
entire folder at once.  To the Unix file system, a Pine folder is
merely any other file with its own internal structure (fortunately,
generally humanly readable).  Just cd to the directory where Pine keeps
its folders (for me it's $HOME/mail) and download the folder/file you
want.  After you have done that, you can edit it on your own computer
to your heart's content to remove what you don't want, and back in Pine
you can delete the messages you don't want.  A bit of a kludge, but it
works.

I could use some help, maybe a reference to the FAQ, maybe a return note.
I just can't figure out an easier way to print my email.

What I have been doing is using the E command to export to my home 
directory.  Then I use the sz command to send it to my PC via zmodem.
Then I need to hangup, exit communication software, enter Wordperfect, 
access the file, and print it.  I can't do this while I'm still connected 
since I don't have enough memeory on this DOS machine.  I could use the 
DOS command "Print" while I am still on-line.  But "Print" won't convert 
he carriage return to carriage return/line feed, so it won't print out.

So, I get anice printed page, but it sure is hard.  What is the easy way out?

A long time ago someone mailed a sulution that works for me (Pine 9.93)
without recompiling:

Make a file named .mminit in your home directory and put a following line
into it:

set empty-folder-format tenex

It sholud cjange the behaviour of the low-level libraries used by pine.
Hope it helps.=20

Howdy folks,
	I've got about 30MB of over 100 Pine folders of files plus 100's
of addresses on my Unix account.  I want to move it all onto my Win95 PC
and use the 32 bit PC Pine 3.93 as efficiently as possible (read: with
very little changes to my usual use of unix Pine, especially use of
folders and old saved mail).  I've got fine internet file transfer
abilities. 
	Anyone wanna tell me the cool way to do it?  Thanks!

Hi,

	It seems that pine has problems with big messages when they
are inserted in the mail body via ^R. The problem appeared originally
when I was sending a text with greek chars which was about 7600 chars.
The posting was in MIME format and pine encoded that in BASE64.
Unfortunately from the original message there are characters at the
end of the message which did not arrive.

	I thought that it was a problem with the encoding and,
possibly, the greek chars. However I tried to post to myself the
tech-notes.txt file from the pine3.93 distribution.  The message
that I received had many chars missing after the first 10.000 chars.
Trying to associate that with the greek chars posting I suspect that
the problem with a mail is when its size is around 10.000. So, when
I was trying to post my 7600 greek chars they probably were encoded
at a size around the problematic 10.000.

	This problem made us feel very unsafe about the fate of
our big mails. I would greatly appreciate your comments.

Thank you,

We read our Unix email using Pine 3.91 and a Windows Telnet application 
called Host Presenter.

Does anyone know how we can get Unix, Pine, or Host Presenter to make our 
PC's beep at us when we get new mail?  We'd like to be able to leave a 
Pine session running in the background during the day but be able to hear 
when we have new mail.

The protection of /var/spool/mail should be set to 1777; that is, public
write with the sticky bit.

You didn't get this message with 3.91 because 3.91 ignored this error
condition.  Ignoring it prevents locking against mail delivery when Pine
is rewriting the mailbox, resulting in lost mail or damaged mail files.
That's why 3.93 doesn't ignore it any more.

As for why it was ignored, it was falsely represented to me many years ago
that 775 protections on /var/spool/mail only occur on systems in which
sendmail uses flock() instead of .lock files for locking.

Pine only supports Internet RFC-822 addressing syntax.

DECnet syntax is particularly problematic, since it collides with RFC-822
group syntax and source route syntax.

I suggest that you use sendmail rules to rewrite DECnet syntax into
Internet syntax, and use Internet syntax exclusively.

A problem was found in Pine 3.93 that could occur when big files were
being sent on relatively slow systems. This bug would result in strings of
missing characters at seemingly random places in the raw message (it could
therefore also corrupt MIME attachments). To me, this seems to be the
problem you are having.

The problem is related to the alarm() calls that get executed to update
the progress indicator which is displayed while the message is being sent.

This problem will be fixed in the new Pine 3.94 release, which will be
available soon at your regular supplier :-)

Kind regards,

- Richard.

This particular technique works in Pine 3.93, but it is undocumented and it
probably will not work in future versions of Pine.  I recommend strongly
against relying upon it.

does any one know of a way to take a VMSmail .DIS file and transfer it
into Unix pine format?  I can transfer an copy the .DIS (distribution
list) to Unix but form there I am stumped.  How do I get this distribution
list into pine format?  I have tried to just copy it into my .addressbook
file but, Pine has its own format for and addressbook with the nickname,
name and then the address.  Is there a way to convert this or do I have to
do this line by line?

Thanks in advance!

You can use the ";" command to select a group of messages, either one at a time
or based on common criteria.  Then use the "A" command ("Apply") followed by the
E and the filename to export the whole group of messages to a single file which
you can then download.  The messages are not separated within the file (except
by a CRLF).

  It may sound silly, but I'd like to suggest
that Pine  allow users to optionally use  two separate
character set names for header encoding (=?charset?B?....?= or
=?charset?Q?....?=) and 'charset=' parameter 
of 'Content-Type:' header. With this **optional**
(thus not affecting those who don't need it)
feature, one would be able to send out 
Korean messages strictly conforming to RFC 1557,
which requires that KSC 5601(8bit, EUC-KR) 
in the body of the message is encoded in ISO-2022-KR
(thus in 'Content-Type:' header,paramter 'charset=' 
is to be 'ISO-2022-KR') while EUC-KR characters 
in header are to be B or Q encoded with charset name 
'EUC-KR'. (B encoding is preferred). The same may be
the case for Chinese messages in ISO-2022-CN, for which
RFC is being written(or may have been already written). 


  Enclosed is what Korean message following RFC 1557 looks like
where ^[ stands for ESC(ASCII 27, \033), ^N for SO(ASCII 14),
and ^O for SI(ASCII 15) and 'Korean' means any EUC-KR(8bit)
characters with MSB stripped off to make them 7bit. 
Details are not relevant to this suggestion since code conversion 
can be done by 'sending-filter' in Pine 3.92 or later.

This is just a beginner talking - but i think that if you go from the 
main menu into Setup, then Config and trawl through the options you'll 
find one that is 'nntp server' or similar.

Find out the name of your news server from the relevant admin people and 
insert it (ie news.zzz.xxx).

I'm unsure because in the end I went back to using TIN - because I found 
the threading of posts makes it easier to deal with high volume groups.

Hope this helps point you in the right direction.

Pine does not care about the origin of a MIME message, only the
content.

Eudora expects a Content-Disposition: header, which Pine does not
currently support.  I'm not all that familiar with Eudora, but I would
consider the inability to save parts of a MIME message separately to
be a serious limitation....

That sort of informative text belongs in the preamble before the first
MIME part.  If Eudora puts it inside the MIME body, Pine has no way to
suppress it...

We will probably add support for Content-Disposition in Pine 4.  That
will hopefully improve compatibility...

Subject: Preventing PINE to use maildomains
Date: 11 Jun 1996 10:33:47 GMT
Message-Id: <4pji2b$e68@rc1.vub.ac.be>

Greetings,

We are having some problems configuration PINE 3.93. Compilation works
fine, the problem is that PINE 3.93 automatically fills in maildomains
in the From: and Return-Path: headers, which is based on the hostname
and the domainname of the machine.
However, as our system serves users belonging to different maildomains 
(ulb.ac.be, vub.ac.be), we use sendmail to determine the From: and 
Return-Path: for a user; to archieve this, sendmail uses a special 
database which contains which user belongs to which domain.

I have tried to correct some things with the 2 definitions in the PINE 
configuration file which I believe are relevant:

# Sets domain part of From: and local addresses in outgoing mail.
user-domain=

# If "user-domain" not set, strips hostname in FROM address. (Unix only)
use-only-domain-name=

but setting these in the system's pine.conf file has no effect. With 
pine 3.93, I *can* override the maildomain by setting the "user-domain" 
to a specific value, but I can only define one, either vub.ac.be or 
ulb.ac.be, not both. Agreed, each user can define this for him/herself, 
but PINE uses this maildomain also when mailing to someone having an 
address on the same machine; if the user does not include the maildomain 
in the email address of his correspondent, PINE fills in the maildomain 
of the user sending the message. Again, the user can do something about
that by typing the full email address including the maildomain of course.

I also tried to install PINE 3.91, which has a slightly different way
of filling in the maildomain than in 3.93, but the hostname still gets 
included in the From: address if I do not define the "user-domain".

Is there any easy solution to prevent PINE using this kind of automatic 
maildomain determination without having to "patch" the PINE code itself? 
What I want in fact is that PINE leaves alone any addresses specified by
the user (To, From, Cc, ...), i.e. PINE does not have to resolve the email 
addresses but has to leave it to sendmail to fill those in. Is a patch 
available perhaps? Or did I overlook something? Thanks for any 
suggestions.

Regards,

Peter

Hi,

	I have not been able to make pine to send authentication info
to the news server where it tries to read Usenet news from. This is
necessary as the news server can keep groups/lists which are not
accessible by everyone but only by authorised users. So, a password
mechanism would be necessary, I think.

Thanks,

Actually Pine 3.93 is the current version, and version 3.94 is due out
really soon.

You can get the latest source code kit from ftp.cac.washington.edu
(directory /pine)

You didn't mention what version of Pine you are currently using!

Pine 3.93 (the current version) certainly supports authentication for
reading and/or posting Usenet News.

Date: 11 Jun 1996 15:41:57 GMT
Message-Id: <4pk445$hbh@samba.rahul.net>


I've got Pine 3.92 on a system at work. I'd like to use that local
copy of Pine to access my inbox located at an ISP on a system
completely outside my company (different domain). I've tried
modifying the Pine configuration to achieve this but have been
unsuccessful. Is there an easy way to do this? Can somebody advise me
so I don't have to bumble my way through the setup?

Thanks!

I monitor two email accounts, one on Homer and one on Carson.  When I
respond to a message in Pine on Homer, the signature line is placed above
the old message and below where the new message goes.  This is the way it
should be.  When I do the same thing in Pine on Carson, the signature
line goes at the end after the old message.  Can you tell me what is
wrong?  Thank you.

I am trying to find out more about PINE.  I would appreciate some help.
Thanks in advance.  I have sent for a FAQ e-mail also.
1.  Is there a way to change the defaults on my e-mail when using PINE?
    I do not want messages automatically deleted upon exit.
2.  How do I delete, then expunge a single message?  I just deleted and 
expunged my entire base of messages and I needed some of the information.
3.  Is there a help manual floating around out there someplace?
    Thanks

Hey all...

I use pop mail.  Since I dial in to retrieve my mail, as much as I 
would love to send mail through pine, I can't because I cannot set my 
return address.  My return address is simply a bogus root@ or user@ 
my machine name.  If there is a way to set a REPLY or REPLY-TO field 
in the header of my outgoing emails through the use of PINE (without 
editing Sendmail.cf) this would be appreciated.  Thanks! :)

Please email me back as I do not have the fortune of reading

    Pine by itself will not put incoming mail into different folders
for you.  You have to use some sort of filtering program ahead of Pine,
such as procmail or (Elm's) filter on Un*x systems.  If you have a WWW
browser, browse my home page and follow the link to Nancy McGough's
pages.  She has a lot of good information on mail filtering.

If you did it, you are not alone. I have the same problem with PINE 3.93,
Linux 2.0. It always adds the header line: 

To: Undisclosed recipients: ;

even when there are obviously recipients (in the To: or Cc:). Not fatal, but
annoying.

It appears that this new mouse code is either very buggy or is not
completely implemented.  But while composing a message, you can move
the cursor around by simply clicking at a new position (doesn't always
work correctly - try clicking on the "to" line in the header while the
cursor is in the body).  

To cut and paste, hold down the shift key and use buttons 1 & 2 like you
would in an xterm.  You can then click on "send" at the bottom of the
screen to send the message (But when it asks for confirmation, clicking
on "yes", "no", or "cancel" does not work).

I've been waiting for this functionality.  I hope the maintainers can
get all the bugs worked out.

Just wondering if anyone out there has gotten these two progams to "play nice" together under Linux 1.2.13 (or any other OS for that matter)?

if you have, please describe exactly what steps you took to arrive at such a happy union... because I am at my wit's end here.

On your Carson account, go to the Config screen and find the
"signature-at-bottom" feature, then UNset it.

If you have access to a World-Wide Web browser you may also like to check
out the Pine Information Centre at:

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/

If you don't want a message deleting as you leave Pine then don't delete
the message!

Reading a message does NOT automatically delete a message; it simply
removes its "New" status, as indicated by the "N" at the start of its
summary line in the Index screen.

You *request* a message be deleted by using the "D" command.  This puts a
"D" at the start of the summary line in the Index screen for the message.
When you close the folder (eg, by quitting Pine) or ask Pine to expunge
deleted messages (using the "X" command) *then* messages are actually
deleted.

(In fact, if you're doing this by quitting out of Pine then the default
even then is NOT to expunge the folder immediately but to ask you for
confirmation.)

If you're not seeing this action then I suspect Pine's settings have been
changed, either for you along (in your personal settings) or the
system-wide defaults (set up by the system administrator).  You can review
these settings and change them by using the Setup (S) command followed by
Configuration (C) ... use these at Pine's Main Menu screen.

Things to look out for there include:

  * Is "expunge-without-confirm" set?  If so then you WON'T be asked to
    confirm expunging folders as you quit out of Pine: it'll just happen.

  * Is "read-message-folder" set?  If so then any messages you read in
    your INBOX folder will be moved to the named folder and deleted from
    the INBOX.  You will be prompted to confirm this action whenever it
    is about to happen unless the "auto-move-read-msgs" feature is also
    set.

The latter MAY be the cause of your "vanishing messages" ... in fact
they're not really being "deleted" simply moved out of your INBOX into
another folder, where they still remain.  Your systems administrator may
have set this up as standard behaviour to, for example, reduce pressure on
the disk mail is delivered to by moving read messages elsewhere.

> 2.  How do I delete, then expunge a single message?  I just deleted and 
> expunged my entire base of messages and I needed some of the information.

To delete a single message:
  1. Read it (or highlight it on the Index screen) and give the "D"
     command to *request* it be deleted at some point in the future
  2. Expunge the folder by giving the "X" command.  (Note that this will
     *actually delete* ALL messages you have *requested* be deleted.)

> 3.  Is there a help manual floating around out there someplace?

Assuming you are using Pine on a UNIX system you'll probably be able to
get some help on starting Pine by looking at its manual page (if your
systems administrator has installed this page):

	man pine

Otherwise try using the help system built into Pine.  General information
is available by typing "?" at the Main Menu screen.  In virtually every
other place context-sensitive (ie, relevant to what you're currently
doing/have selected) help is available by typing ^G (often the "?" synonym
will also display this help).

Other information is available at the Pine Information Centre on the Web
(see the URL above).

It is *important* that something is ALWAYS present in the "To:" field. 
(Some people try and send out messages to lists of people by just listing
the recipients in the "Cc:" or (better) "Bcc:" fields.)

HOWEVER when such a message arrives at its destination the delivery
software there MAY do funny things if no "To:" header was present.  The
worst case is when the "Bcc:" field was used to list the recipients, in
which case the delivery software MAY reveal the hidden list by converting
the recipients to a visible list of "Apparently-To:" headers.

To prevent these problems Pine 3.92 onwards always fills in the "To:"
field if you do not do so.  The default text it fills it with is
"Undisclosed recipients" (but you can change this in the Setup
Configuration screen).

You can override it on a poer message basis by filling in the "To:" field
yourself.  You could put a valid e-mail address there (eg, your own to
receive a copy yourself), or a string followed by the magic ":;" sequence
of characters (which then merely acts as a label).

You can add the "Reply-To" (and any other) custom header by:

1.  Start Pine.
2.  At the Main Menu go to the Setup Configuration screen by typing "S"
    then "C".
3.  Move the highlight down to the "customized-hdrs" item.
4.  Read its help by typing "?"
5.  Exit the help screen and follow its instructions.  :-)

Subject: How to print e-mail?
Date: 11 Jun 1996 14:30:48 GMT
Message-Id: <4pjvuo$76@news3.cts.com>

I have never quite figured out how to correctly print out any e-mail 
messages. While in Pine, the only thing I seem to be able to do is click 
on "turn printer on" - but then it will print everything on the screen, 
including the commands on the bottom of the page. Plus it prints only one 
page at a time, so if there is more, I have to hit return, and it will 
continue - but then these commands wind up in the middle of the message, 
and often it will repeat two lines. 

Can somebody please help me figure out how to print messages neat and clean?
Would I have to save it to somewhere else first, as a file? But then what?
Help!

Simone

I just realised that window resizing does not work for pine 3.93 built on
an HP: it appears that /usr/include/sys/termio.h is included too late for
the "#ifdef TIOCGWINSZ" line in osdep/os-hpp.h to take effect.
Am I correct?

It sounds like you are using a "Print Screen" button, or perhaps one that
turns the printer on so that EVERY character your terminal program
receives gets printed.  Instead you should....


1.  (Most Important)  Be using a terminal program that supports ANSI
printer control escape sequences.

These are sequences of special characters that Pine CAN send (if told to
do so) before displaying the message.  The sequence it performs is this:
	Send ANSI "Printer ON" code.
	Send message (which gets rerouted fro the screen to the printer).
	Send ANSI "Printer OFF" code.

This will ONLY work if your terminal program knows about and acts on the
Printer On/Off codes.  (If you don't know and can't find out then just try
it and see.)


2.  Tell Pine to use a locallay-attached printer in the above way.

You do this very simply... From the Main Menu go to the Setp Printer
screen ("S" then *"P"*).  Look at the screen descriptions, and select the
appropriate one from this section:

----------
Printer attached to IBM PC or compatible, Macintosh
    This may not work with all attached printers, and will depend on the
    terminal emulation/communications software in use. It is known to work
    with Kermit and the latest UW version of NCSA telnet on Macs and PCs,
    Versaterm Pro on Macs, and WRQ Reflections on PCs.
      Printer: attached-to-ansi
               attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed
----------


3.  Having done this try printing a message.

Do this by reading a message (or just highlighting it in the Index
screen), and then using the "Y" (prYnt) command.

If your terminal program DOES understand ANSI Printer On/Off codes the
message should come out nicely on your printer (assuming you remembered to
turn it on!:-)

If your terminal program DOESN'T understand the control codes then the
message will just go shooting up the screen instead.  Solution?  Obtain
and use a different terminal program that DOES understand the codes(!).

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

Yeah, I know. I have been informed that this is a known 3.93 bug which
will be fixed in 3.94.

I have done it under Irix5.3 (Pine 3.93) and it worked out very nicely.
Although I do not use premail any more.  To find out what I use now, 
please visit my web page (www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html).

It is hard for us to guess what is wrong if you do not tell more about it.
I remember that one has to make the perl script executable, preferrably by
you only (for security), and you have to enter your own ID in the script
before using it, or the default name will be used and cause you a lot of
confusion.  I remember that premail can chain the email through remailers
to hide your identity in addition to PGP operations.  It is very handy for
those who want to avoid persecutions while doing constructive things, or to 
spam some open mailing lists, threatening, insulting, or trick other people, 
or newsgroups for any or no reason.  I tested this feature but never found 
a use for it so far.

I did exactly what it said to do in the premail release notes: You have to
set the sendmail-path variable in your .pinerc (you *cannot* set it within
pine's configuration screen; it isn't there) to the path of your premail
with some options for to be passed to the real sendmail. After that, you
will need to configure customized-hdrs in pine to include some of the
headers that premail wants: Sign, Chain, Anon-From, Anon-Reply-To appear to 
be the relevant ones, but I have only used Sign and Chain so far. You will
need to use the Rich Header command (^R) in the header when composing. 
The release notes *are* a bit vague on how to decode. The easiest way is to
pipe (|) to the command "premail -decode". I have only been using premail
for a few days and it makes life with PGP a lot easier. 

FYI, this is under Linux 2.0, but should work as well under 1.2.13.

	I don't know, what are you doing?

>I know the server that has the news on it at work but can't seem to
>figure it out.

	This is a good start.  Have you tried to enter the server name in 
the nntp-server feild in the configuration screen in pine? ( M (main), S
(setup), C (configure); arrow down to NNTP-SERVER A (add), then type in
the name of the server.  Then when you are in the folder list screen you
should have a seperate folder collection named news collection.  Type S
(subscribe) and choose the groups that you want to subscribe to.  

Hope this helped!!!

Date: Wed, 12 Jun 1996 12:33:28 GMT

I seem to be getting conflicting signals as to whether Pine 3.93 supports
POP3 or not? I am running PC-Pine. I didn't think it did, but then I've seen
articles posted to this newsgroup that showed folks using a hostname of the
form {hostname/pop3}. I tried this and it didn't work. I'd love to use
PC-Pine as my main mail program but with IMAP it is totally worthless. I have
access to three different ISP's and none of them support IMAP. All support
POP3 though.

Isn't this unusually difficult, since some form of a nickname must also 
be added to each entry?

I want to use more than just the .signature file as signature.  Is it 
possible to make pine pick randomly amongst signature files? and if so, 
how do i configure it to do that?

Please reply to solus@solus.com since i won't be able to access this 
newsgroup.. thanks.

Is anyone using PC Pine with Trumpet on a Lan?  Pine always says it cannot
find host.

PC Pine works well with Tropic's TCP/IP winsock.

All other programs seem to work fine with Tumpet. (Netscape, Ewan, Eudora,
etc.)

Any help would be appreciated.

Are you talking about the enable-full header-cmd or actually the
viewer-hdrs?  the viewer-hdrs is located at the bottom of the feature list
but befor the the saved-msg-name-rule etc... defaults.

Sorry, PC-Pine does not yet support POP.

(Unix Pine can access a POP server in quasi-online mode, but not in
offline mode, as POP was designed for.)

What is it that is giving you problems?
I was able to setup Pine 3.91 and Linux 1.2.13 rather nicely, with one 
small problem that I am not sure is really Pine's fault.
With my current in house SMTP gateway I cannot reply where the From: is 
picked up. I getan error like no recipients to reply to!
This seams to be caused by the fact that there is an X-Status value that 
precedes the From: header.
Anyone know how to configure Pine to compensate for this?
Thanks,

Mike,
Is there any settings and in which file woud it be stored to compensate 
for From: being written later in the header, than it would normally apear?
I have a problem with a SMTP gateway that it adds some internal X-Status 
junk before the From: header and Pine can't read it so it cannot not find 
the return address for a reply. But the interesting thing is that elm 
works fine.
Any idea's?
Thanks,

Is there any way of configuring PINE to automatically enter
one's password when using PINE to read mail from a remote host
using imap (or ?) protocol?

I have checked the .pinerc file but nothing seems to do this function, not even 
the 'initial keystrokes list'...am I missing something obvious/

Thanks

Different admin setup files on different hosts?

I presume you don't *really* mean "but with IMAP it is totally worthless"
-- you surely can't say this without having tried and tested the
configuration.  (We use IMAP here and it works _very_ well.)

I think the weight should be on your following sentences instead.  :-)

No, there is no option in Pine to do this.

If this is REALLY inportant to you (heaven knows why!) then either...

* Store your signatures in files with short (eg, one letter) names which
can be included manually in the message text using the ^R command

or

*  Investigate the new "sending-filters" feature in Pine 3.93 which is
designed as a means of giving you a "hook" into the sending process.

(I'm sure the first person to come up with a decent random signature
includer filter will earn the undying gratitude of those to whome such
things are important.)

Your best bet is to send a sample problem message (complete with headers)
to the Pine Team for comment... I was under the impression that Pine
scanned ALL the headers of a message, and could find entries no matter
which order they appear in.

Make sure you don't have any blank lines within the list of headers (as
this signifies "end of headers, start of body text".

Cheers,

What most people really want when they ask this method is a way of
"pre-authenticating" to the IMAP server.  This is certainly possible for
UNIX Pine providing your server is set up appropriately.  (Can anyone
comment on PC-Pine?)

The steps are:


1.  On the computer running the IMAP server...

a)  Make a symbolic link from /etc/rimapd to point to the real imapd
executable.

b)  Set up your username so that the server trusts the computer you'll be
running Pine on (by setting up a suitable .rhosts file for your username
*on the mail server*).  This then lets you use "rsh" from the named
computer to the IMAP server computer to run commands without having to
supply a username/password (this is determined via the rsh mechanism
itself).

[IMPORTANT: if you get this wrong you can open a security hole to your
username on the mail server; check with your local support desk on how to
do this.]


2.  On the computer you run Pine on...

a)  Test you got the .rhosts file set up properly by typing the following
command:
	rsh imapserver.yoursite.yourdomain /etc/rimapd
You SHOULD get a welcome banner line along the lines of:
	* PREAUTH mailer.york.ac.uk IMAP2bis Service 7.8(100) at Thu, 13
		Jun 1996 10:17:07 +0100 (BST)
To which you should respond:
	A01 logout
If you get prompted for a password then your .rhosts file is wrong.  Other
error messages should give a clue as to what is wrong (probably with the
rsh mechanism or the symbolic link you set up).

b)  Try using Pine to open a mailbox using IMAP on your server.  It should
now open without prompting you for a username and password.

[NOTE FOR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS: Rather than expecting each user to set up
a .rhosts file for themselves (and possibly getting it wrong!) consider
using a "hosts.equiv" file to create a systemwide list of trusted hosts
... but make sure you consider the security implicartions first! :-]

I've seen alot of info on how to save to this folder and that folder, but 
how do I save to the C:\ or a:\ as a ".txt" file.
"e" does not do it and "v" & "s" does not do it.

This should be easy, but I can't figure it out???

Editing the actual .addressbook isn't too difficult in this case.  Each
entry in the list is just an address, and they are separated by commas.

Another way to solve this problem is to get pine 3.94 and mail yourself
the file in the body of a message.  Then the Take command will let you add
all the addresses to a list at once.  (I think this was in 3.92 and 3.93,
too, but if you're getting one of those you should get 3.94 instead.)

Would you really want PINE to keep your passwd somewhere? In a text file 
perhaps? (".pinerc"). I believe it's a security issue.

	Is there a way (other than slugging through by hand) to
check my addressbook for duplicate entries, particularly with
different nicknames?
	And if I do it the hard way, alphabetizing by surname
and then paging through, how do I avoid deleting the wrong one?
I may have either or both nicknames in two or three lists each.
Paging through lots of them for each duplicate name would really
be a drag!

I have two customized headers --- Reply-To: and Return-Receipt-To:.
When I type an addressbook nickname in the Reply-To field, Pine (3.94)
expands it.  But this expansion doesn't occur for the
Return-Receipt-To field.

How does Pine decide which customized headers qualify for addressbook
lookups?

(BTW, the above behaviour is what I want.  The previous version of
Pine expanded Return-Receipt-To also, which caused problems.)

Linux, slackware 3.0.0, compiled pine 3.93 from the pine.tar.gz on
ftp.cac.washington.edu.  The program itself works like a charm, lots of
speedups, enhancements, better configuration options than 3.91.  GREAT
work guys. My users and I love it.

But - I get a "Cannot open file for writing" in the message-status bar
when I compose mail.

Here is a copy of the most recent .pine-debug1 .  Any help would be
appreciated.  I read over the .pine-debug1 file, but I don't see anything
that could be wrong/broken.  If I've blatently over-looked something, let
me know, loudly if necessary :)

Thanks!

I'm having trouble setting up global address books.  I'm using version3.90 with SCO Unix on an HP 
netserver.  The file /usr/local/lib/pine.conf doesn't exist.  I'm not sure how to create it (through
vi...?) or how to get pine to recognize it.  Also once the file is setup, may I just use nicknames for the
distribution lists?

Please help this novice PINE user!!

Does PINE 3.91 (UNIX) use a mimetypes file, and if so, what is the name?

The documentations do not cover this - they only discuss how PINE 
"sniffs" the file to be encoded and sets the mimetype based on this.

Thank you in advance.    -=BB

On our system, the /etc/passwd (and shadow) don't contain any passwords.
Instead all daemons that need it, queries a special "security-server"
for which user is connected to this port, and thereby limits the use
of passwords to a minimum (only used in terminal-servers when connecting).

This means that a user connecting with IMAP to the mailserver can't use
a password to identify himself. The authentication must be done by asking
the securityserver.

We also don't want the average joe to be able to rsh to the mailserver.
They should be limited to just use "user-servers".

Because of this I have tried to patch the imap-server to use our special
authentication method, and thereafter respond with the "PREAUTH"-message.
However this won't work for some reason. (Pine tries to connect,
and thereafter responds something like "the server closed the connection".
Seems like pine is expecting something to happen (probably to get a ok to
authentify the user), which never occurs, and then gets dissconnected
after a timeout from the server. When I telnet manually everything seems
to be fine.)

(We now NFS-mounts the /var/mail on the user-servers, something we would
like to get rid of, because that NFS is too slow for our needs)

Anyone got an idea why the patched IMAP-server won't work with Pine?
An idea what we might need to do to Pine to accept a preauth-message
from a (in it's view) a regular IMAP-connection?

All suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Sincerely

Is there a way that I can get pine to use two SMTP servers that way I can 
send mail from my two adresses.
Chad
P.s. I know I can telnet to port 25 other server or change the pinec 
everytime I want to send mail but this is too time consuming.

No... mime.types support was introduced in Pine 3.92 (the current version
is now Pine 3.94).

If I recall correctly the man page for these versions of Pine describe the
locations searched for mime.types and mailcap files.  Alternatively you
can, as I did, search the source code (eg, using grep) looking for the
string 'mime.types'.

Cheers,

Hi,
I use pine to read news but when I post then there in Folder Index
where I would like to see my name appears 'To: some.newsgroup..'.
Does anybody know how to solve this, please? Thank you.

We are testing the new version of pine.
Unfortunately when we mail or post to news groups they always arrive
encoded in MIME. Even when we request 8bit posting (we use greek
chars) the subject and the body message arrive MIME encoded.

I have experienced similar discrepancies with the same matter in
the previous pine versions as well.

Could you please tell me if I am doing something wrong?

Thanks,

This is perfectly normal and affects only your display.

It is trying to helpful by displaying more information (it seems a bit
pointless just to say the item was from yourself).  Instead whenever you
see "To:" you know you sent the message AND you can also see who it was
to.

More information displayed = more use to you.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hi,

Sorry I'm sending you this directly and cc-ing the list, but main to the
list keeps bouncing for me (probably this cc as well!)  I can't seem to
access the imap web page.  I know it works because I sent another mail
about this before and all responses said it was fine.  I get the list and
recieved instructions on how to set up pine to be an imap client without
having to enter a username and passwd, etc.  I linked /usr/local/etc/imapd
to /etc/rimapd and put a + in my ~/.rhosts file.  My username/UID/GID on
my home machine are identicle to work and rsh workmachine /etc/rimapd
works as you described in previous mail.  "A01 logout" works fine as well.
However, pine (3.91 for linux) still prompts me for a username and passwd.
I can't find settings to augment this behavior in the rc file, so I grab
3.94 and drop it in.  It compiles fine (a few errors I didn't unerstand,
but the build completed.  I think it was looking for "bfd" something or
other -- a hard coded path for something I don't have installed?).
Anyway, now I'm running 3.94.  The enable-mouse-in-xterm setting does very
strange things.  No big deal, I can do without that (although I'd like to
get it working).  This big deal is, now I get prompted for a passwd when
pine just starts up -- before I only got prompted when I tried to access a
folder collection on the imap server machine.  Not only that, but I get
prompted for a passwd again when I try to access my work incoming folder
collection, and then again when I try to access my work saved folder
collection!  Perhaps the first authentication is for the SMTP server
setting and the others are correct?  The SMTP server is set to the same
machine my imap collections are on.  If this is the correct behavior, I
_really_ need to get this PREAUTH stuff working.  Any Ideas?  By the way,
my work machine is a SPARC4 runnning Solaris2.5 and the imap daemon from
the 3.93 pine dist.

TIA

P.S.: Any chance of "imap" being changed to "impa"?  I keep misspelling
it!!!  Either that or I'll have to learn to type!!!

Subject: PINE 3.93 on AIX 4.1.3


We are rolling out PINE 3.93 to our 200+ users on an IBM R30 using AIX
4.1.3.  We have a variety of terminal types (WYSE 150's, AIXTERM, PC's
running KERMIT etc).  All of them have been experiencing pine locking up at
various times.  We seem to be seeing the problems mostly when going into the
Compose mode from the main menu, or from the address book using the COMPOSE
TO command.  The users sessions just freezes up.  Unfortunately, it is not
consistent at all, one time it works, the next time it does not.  

Are there any known issues running PINE 3.93 on AIX 4.1.3 that we need to be
aware of, (fixes per chance?)

Greg

If you know where I can get a SCO Pine 3.9[34] binary please tell me.  I 
found a 3.91 on Celestial.com a year ago but it's never been updated.

Any other SCO/pine users out there?

Dieter,
	All I've ever done is untar it and then type "./build hpp".  The
binarys will be placed in a subdirectory called "bin/".  The documentation
(and man pages) is in "doc/".

We don't run DNS, so "fully qualified" is just the hostname.  This is
another little peeve of mine, as of 3.93, Pine barks about that!  Any way
to shut that off?  My work machine is _NOT_ attached to the internet.  We
batch our outgoing mail through another network (of HP/UX machines) and
from there to MCI, and then to the internet.  There are Checkpint
firewalls at least 6 deep between me and the outgoing spool.  My netscape
access is secure and triple proxied (me<->F1<->F2<->F3<->internet).  All
of this is fortified with SeOS as well.  I'm not saying that even this is
bullet proof, but we have whole departments dedicated to assuring security
here. If someone can get through all of that, my silly little .rhosts file
is surely not our biggest problem.

Wrong.  They need to have the same identity as me (ie. UID/name/GID?) and
the source host needs to be well known to my system.  Since we don't run
DNS, this is a pretty tough spoof.  We also run secure RPC.

Already done.  I only used the "+" for testing last night.

My SMTP server setting is another machine -- my imap server machine.  Does
my local sendmail just forward everything pine sends to it? What exactly
does this setting do?  I was under the impression that setting this to
another machine told pine to bypass the local SMTP agent (sendmail) and
talk SMTP directly to the host set in the variable.  Obviously I was
wrong, but could you clarify this mechanism?

Date: Sun, 09 Jun 1996 12:41:07 GMT
Message-Id: <31babe4d.28194979@203.12.22.10>



I have two main folders: The INBOX for received mail and SENTMAIL for
mail I have sent. There are now about 500 messages in each of these.
What I would like to do is have all the mail in one folder, sorted by
date order.

I can save messages individually to another folder and then Sort them.
However, messages need to be saved one at a time. Can I "select" all
messages and save them all at once? Having done that for both folders,
I will have a larger folder that contains all the messages, but they
will be added on to each other, not in date order. I can then do a
sort by date order, but then how can I save the messages *in sorted
order*? The messages will not be saved in that order and I wish to
print the folder on to paper for my records so I need a file that is
already sorted.

I would like to do this with folders I have pulled off my shell
account and manipulate locally using PC Pine rather than on the shell
account. So any differences in this regard between the Unix and PC
versions of Pine are significant.

Any ideas?

Regards,

David Maddison

This issue was discussed in detail more than a month ago and I have 
settled on a scheme that use send-filter to encrypt/clear-sign, and 
display-filter with a c-script for decryption in Pine (3.92, or 3.93). 
I put together a web page describing the configuration procedure for
this purpose.  Please feel free to visit it:

Thanks for your responses on the question of mime.types in PINE 3.91.

(the answer is mime.type support began with PINE 3.92 and is not present 
in 3.91).

My job involves searching for information on the Net using Netscape and
then giving that info to my boss. I'd like to be able to just email the
information straight to her but when I've tried what she gets has every
formatting code showing. This is especially bad when the information is in
a table format. I don't think graphics translate at all.  I've tried
saving the information as a file first but when it saves and I open it in,
say, W4W, all the formatting is there too.

	Can anyone tell me how to send formatted information from Netscape
to Pine email. Also, can I even do it with graphics?

Thanks...

Before I mention my problem I want to say that overall, pine is a very
good mail reader, pine3.93 has some enhancements that make those of us who
depend on speech very happy!  getting rid of those overlapping lines from
screen to screen and the status line messages all the time makes things a
lot less complicated with unnecessarry chatter.

Anyway the help says that if you set mail checking to 0 it wil nto keep
telling you every time you have new mail!  This is really a problem since
it interupts the message your reading with new from so and so regarding
such and such.  also, if I am writing a message, pause, and a new message
comes in, I notice that some of the text from the new message is on the
screen and what I have previously written isn't viewable,  Anyway setting
the interval to 0 isn't working it is still beeping and chattering away
about new messages constantly, can anyone help?


If possible, please write to me directly, I don't always have time to
monitor the newsgroup, thanks in advance.

   I have several folders, all on a remote system, which recieve new
mail.  My understanding is that I may press tab to go to the next new
message in any folder while on an index listing.  This works as
expected if I'm at the index listing for my main inbox, but I get 'no
new messages in folder' if I'm on the index for a different incoming
folder.

   I'm using Pine 3.94 on a fairly modern Linux system for the client,
and the imapd (patched to support shadow passwords -- why isn't this
included?) from the same distribution on a somewhat older Linux system
for the server.

   Be nice, I'm pretty new to Pine -- couldn't stand it before 3.92.

Specs:
-------
  - Linux 2.0.0 (with all the proper upgrades!)
  - kernel compiled with quota support
  - merged/modified version of quota-1.33 and acct-1.1.18
  - Sendmail 8.7.3/8.6.9
  - Pine 3.91

User quotas work extremely well, both soft and hard limits.
My question is, (how) does Sendmail support user quotas.  When I
have tried to stress out the quotas on the mail partition, by slamming a
inbox, Sendmail appears to continue to deliver to a over-the-quota user.

Is there a setting in the sendmail.cf for quotas?  If so I can't find
it.

How have any of you handled when users have a _really_ big inbox?

Having Pine access a 12M inbox (for those that have learned about
attatchments but not FTP :) is not a great situation!

Thank you for any help,

Kenn Herman

p.s.  I have looked in the FAQ, on the Web and here in this newsgroup
for answers, so I am sorry if this has been brought up before...

How about something like the following in your ~/.pinerc ....
incoming-folders=Unix-mail{unix.collider.com/pop3}, BBS-mail{bbs.collider.com/pop3}

Subject: mailbox index display compatibility bug with 3.93 and 3.94

Message-Id: <31C1E214.5642@fhcrc.org>
Mime-Version: 1.0

There appears to be a fairly large compatibility problem with pine 3.93
and 3.94 with older mailboxes.  This was seen with the Solaris binary
distribution of both 3.93 and 3.94.
 
When displaying the index in older mailboxes/folders, the messages that
are from the user do not display as "To: <who sent to>" but as "<user's
name>".  Basicly it is not following the default behavior described in 
the help for the index-format configure option.  (index-format=STATUS 
MSGNO DATE FROMORTO(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%))
 
It looks like it is doing:
index-format=STATUS MSGNO DATE FROM(33%) SIZE SUBJECT(67%)
 
Newer folders seem to display correctly when using the default.
 
I tried explicitly listing the default configuration in index-format, 
but it didn't work.
 
I looked at the mail headers of the different folders and the only
difference that I can see is that the newer messages have the X-Sender
line.
 
Any help and pointers to fixes would be welcome.  We've already had two
people at our site complain about this.  Please email any responses 
directly to me.

Thanks,
	Bill

Date: Sun, 09 Jun 1996 12:41:05 GMT
Message-Id: <31babcae.27779966@203.12.22.10>



This is my situation: I have both a ppp and shell account with my ISP.
I use the PPP account for everything but mail, which I do using pine
on the shell account. The reason I do this is so that I can telnet in
from other locations if I am away from home and still have access to
all my old mail. It is important that I always have my mail collection
available wherever I log in from.

I would also like to keep a complete record of my mail on my PC as
well as on my ISP shell account. Using PC pine could I use this as the
reader I use during my PPP session (at home) and make this so that any
new mail is copied to both the shell and the PC-Pine directory?

This way I'll always have a copy of my mail when at home using
PC-Pine, whether I am logged on or not and I will also have a mail
record for when I am away and have to telnet into the shell.

Regards,

David Maddison

Why do the makefiles contain the lines

 # LDCC= /usr/bin/cc
 # If you don't have /usr/bin/cc (our Solaris 2.2 doesn't seem to have it,
 # it only has /usr/ucb/cc) then change LDCC to the following line and
 # give that a try.  This is still using the Solaris compiler but
 # leaving out the UCB compatibility includes and libraries.
 LDCC= $(PICODIR)/cc5.sol

the Sun Compiler is _never_ going to be in /usr/bin and normally
resides in

/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc

(people will now disagree)

I'm porting a number of large packages to Solaris 2.4 and pine 3.93/4 is
the first that seems to have a big problem (despite all this it seems to
work....) of "knowing" where things are...

You need to write more code in map_open() in c-client/imap2.c

In the current code, PREAUTH is only believed when you do an rsh
connection, not when you do a TCP connection.  This is changed in some
newer versions of imap-4 toolkit, but the version used by Pine is still an
older one.

For what it's worth, this sounds like an excellent reason to fire your ISP
and find a new one.  There are so many responsive ISPs out there that
there is no reason to continue to give your money to an unresponsive one.

The usual excuse given by an ISP for having POP but not IMAP is that they
won't want to have disk space taken up by having mail kept on their
machine.  This is yet another reason to fire them; there's no excuse for
this attitude given today's disk prices.

Oh, offhand, I'd say
/usr/local/ftp/pub/yarn/yarn_089.zip

at IOHK. Also, if you'd like to do it in windows,
download winyrn71.zip from the same directory. But you'll
have to get YARN for DOS working first, and that does
take some fiddling. I was happy when I did it, though.
Let me know if you need any scripts once it's
running. I download all my stuff with one command, 
upload it with another.
Cheers.

Whenever I use our global addressbook at </u/lby/.global> for the 
first time in a Pine (3.91) session a messages flashes "[Lookup file 
/tmp//a3218266 Doesn't Exit. Creating]."  That number following the "a" 
increases for each sequential Pine session.  I didn't used to get this 
message,  and I don't get it when I access my personal addressbook at 
</u/lby/notjdm/.addressbook>.

The global addressbook does seem to be functioning,  but that message is 
a bit of an irritant, especially when the system is slow.  Can anyone 
offer me any theories as to why this is happening?

I started out with a pine 3.93 binary that was about 3.8M and it stripped
down just as you describe.

You can forward your mail to yourself and to a program that gives a

I'm getting a strange problem I hope somebody can suggest a solution to.
I'm trying to send to a local alias, but Pine refuses to send the message
saying instead:

can't access alias via name service "files" ... (and the rest gets cut off
of my screen)

The alias is in the aliases file (it's a list of recipients) on the local
machine.  Is there something that needs to be done?

No; you need a later version.  (3.94 is the latest.)

Catherine,
As I think you figured out, this problem has nothing to do with Pine, 
but here's a hint that may be useful:  In Netscape when you send a
document, you can click on the "Attach" button, and then you'll have
a chance to click on a button that says something like "convert to plain
text".

Do not post anonymously by "forging" mail.  It may very well be
a violation of your site's policies.  There are mechanisms that
have been set up explicitly for what you want to do.  They are
called anonymous remailers.  Take a look at 
  http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~galactus/remailers/
for information about them.

Hello,

Compiling 3.94 on aix4.1 (build a41) produces
tons of errors and finally hangs and never finishes!
(using a32 is not any better,  it also hangs and generates a lot of errors).


I sent the "script" capture to "pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu"
but I got a automated message back!

Can someone from pine development group gets back to me ...

Thanks,

Do you have a recent version of Trumpet?  I found that PC-Pine 3.91 
failed to send messages until we found a newer version (2.1b, I think).

If there is a FAQ on this please point me in the right direction.  I was
wondering if there is a way that you can send a null message.  I wnat to
test my addresses in my addressa book to make sure that they will send out
and will not have an error in the domain name or the like.  I don't want
these people to receive messages that keep saying this is a test and the
like.

Thanks!

Hello everybody --

Can someone please confirm me in the following problem...  If I receive an
email with MIME line "Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII" in its
header, and reply to it in an 8-bit character set (ISO Latin 2 in my case), the
outcoming message should be tagged with "Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN;
CHARSET=ISO-8859-2", not US-ASCII.  Correct?

My version of Pine (an admittedly ancient version, though -- 3.89) doesn't do
it -- it simply copies the Content-Type line from the message I reply to,
irrespective  of "character-set" line in my ~/.pinerc.  If you can assure me
that this bug has been fixed in the later versions, this might be a good reason
for upgrading Pine... :-)

Best regards, Primoz

Message-Id: <4q1702$js0@cc.tut.fi>

I have a problem with pine (Slackware Linux) using a remote mailbox.
The inbox-path in .pinerc is set to {194.157.2.114}INBOX. Pine tries
to connect ok, but returns this: 'Can't connect to my.server;143,
connection refused.' At no point does pine ask for my username and
password on the remote system.

What could be wrong? Is there a way to tell the username an passwd
to pine beforehand? What about that port 143, perhaps that's wrong?

My pine version is 3.91.

BTW: Netscape Mail uses the same mailbox ok.

If you are trying to randomize your sig, how about writing a crontab file
to keep saving your various sigs as signature.  It could do this once per
day or as often as you want.  Then pine will always load signature, but it
will be different each time.

    This question comes up on this newsgroup probably at least once a
week.  It really ought to be made clearer in the Pine documentation.

    To answer the question: Pine will not filter messages for you. 
It has no capability to do so.  You have to use some program or
process to filter the mail before Pine gets hold of it.  Under Un*x,
procmail and (Elm) filter are two widely used programs.

    If you have a World Wide Web browser, browse my home page, follow
the link to Pine and mail filtering, and follow the next link to
Nancy McGough's WWW pages.  She has a lot of useful information on mail
filetering.

I'm using pine 3.93 and saw that I could access multiple news servers
by setting up separte folder for each server.

This is very nice, except that I can't seem to figure out how to
have separate .newsrc files for each news server (they all have
different newsgroups, so they can't share the same .newsrc).

How would I make it possible to have different .newsrc files

I have a short question for whoever it may concern:

When I post a mail to a newsgroup my real name doesn't show up, instead
it says "To: <newsgroup name>".

How do I change this?? It doesn't look nice at all.

I already asked my local provider but they didn't know.

I'm using the OS/2 port of PC-Pine 3.92 as my mailer, and wonder if that's
the most current OS/2 port, or if there's a port of 3.93?

I have experienced 2 problems with pc-pine 3.94  which I don't know if I'm the 
only one who have seen:

1. Character set problem
-------------------------------------

We have pine set to ISO-8859-1 character set.

The problem is that pine3.94 forgets it's set to that characterset after a new 
message has been Composed. After a message has been Composed pine begins to 
display the HEX numbers for the non US characters instead of the characters.


2. addr-book problem
-------------------------------

When the first Compose is made after pine has been started then, when the 
first nickname is entered, it comes up and displays the message:

<xxxx>.lu isn't valid, rebuilding....

even though it just rebuild the under the first Compose the last time it was 
started.

What is your current configuration?  I had the same problem when I first
set it up, but I found that mine was caused by including my full email
address as my username, when all I needed was my login name.  Other than
that, if you have your nameserver set up properly in your dialer, and
you've got your mail server entered properly, it should work fine. Can you
give more details?

Every address book file has an associated "lookup" file designed to speed
up access to entries in the address book.  These lookup files typically
have the same name as the address book file proper, but with the string
".lu" appended to it.

If Pine spots that the lookup file is missing, or is not stored in the
correct format, it tries to create/update it.  If it can't do this
(perhaps because you don't have sufficient access privileges) it instead
creates a temporary lookup file in /tmp that is uses just for the current
session and warns you as it does so.  The name of this temporary file is
derived, as is common practice, from the process id in an attempt to
ensure it is unique (hence the changing number wach time).

Your solution is for you (or whoever has root privileges) to create/update
the lookup file associated with your global address book file.  This is
done very simply by:

	<cd to the directory containing the global addressbook>
	pine -create_lu addrbookname sortorder
	<check ownership of address book and look up files>
	chmod a+r addrbookname.lu

where "addrbookname" is the name of the global address book file, and
"sortorder" is one of a small number of keywords describing how the
address book's contents is to be ordered.  (See the man page for Pine to
find out what options are available.)

Note the steps to check ownership and, in particular, mode (protection) of
the lookup file.  Pine 3.93 onwards are better at preserving these when
upgrading a lookup file, but don't know what they should be set to when
creating it.

Also note that the address book lookup file format changed between Pine
3.91 and the current 3.94, so you will definitely need to do the above
when you eventually upgrade versions of Pine (highly recommended).

Cheers,

According to the help text available on the Index screen...

----------
NEXT NEW (TAB) COMMAND

When you press the TAB key, Pine advances to the next "interesting"
message.  When you are using Pine to read email, that message is the next
message in the folder which you have not read before, or that you have
previously flagged as Important.  When reading news folders, the next
"interesting" message is the next one that you have not yet deleted.
----------

HOWEVER I seem to recall that "interesting" has a subtley different
meaning for non-INBOX folders...

In particular it means something along the lines of "the first 'New'
message that has arrived after the last time you looked in this folder.
(Presumably on the assumption that when you looked in the folder
previously and decided not to read some of the then-'New' messages you
still don't want to read them, but are more interested in the message(s)
just arrived.

Personally I find the behaviour of TAB in such screens a bit
counter-intuitive and not terribly well documented.

Would anyone on the Pine Team care to give a more definitive definition of
TAB's actions?  (I remember we've been over this ground some time back,
but the exact details elude me.)  And perhaps reword the help text at some
point?

Cheers,

Ummmm....  Depending on what is meant by "undisclosed recipients" I
thought that even with Pine 3.91 it was possible to:

1.  Start composing your message.
2.  Put cursor on a header line and type ^R to see all the headers.
3.  Fill in your own e-mail address in the "To:" field.
4.  List the real recipients in the "Bcc:" field.
5.  Finish off the message and send it.

Terry's answer is correct in that with Pine 3.91 the "To:" field isn't
_automatically_ set to "undisclosed recipients" but the above method,
where you set it manually, should work OK.

Note that you can probably improve things even further by changing Step 3
to:

3.  Fill in the "To:" fields with the string "undisclosed recipients:;"
    (Be sure to include the ":;" -- this is some trickery to get the mail
    system to accept the field's value as a valid-but-non-existant e-mail
    address.)

Cheers,

Somebody else just asked this question; see my answer (just sent out to

Not as of Pine 3.93.

(I haven't yet upgraded to 3.94 so can't say for certain about that
version, but I sincerely doubt it as 3.94 is mainly a "fix a few bugs"
release.)

Your current configuration for "inbox-path" tells Pine:

	1.  That the folder name is "INBOX".
	2.  It is to be found on host 194.157.2.114
	3.  (implicit) The IMAP protocol is to be used to access the
	    folder.

IMAP is the Internet Message Access Protocol (sic) that has been designed
to allow remote access to and manipulation of message folders (both mail
and Usenet News).

In order to work you need an IMAP client program (in this case Pine), and
an IMAP server (or imapd) running on the host computer.  The two then
communicate with each other via a link established, as standard, on port
143.

Your "Can't connect to my.server" message is Pine's way of saying that it
tried to connect to an IMAP server on port 143 of the specified host but
couldn't.  (It doesn't want a username or password yet; it MAY want these
only after it has connected and then tries to authenticate.)

This implies that the computer 194.157.2.114 isn't actually running the
IMAP server software (either because it has never been installed/set up,
ort because there is some configuration problem).

As always in these cases you will need to talk to the systems
administrator of that computer, rather than a bunch of people like us
around the world.  Ask them if the run an IMAP server.  If they say "Yes"
then check you have the machine and port number details correct.  If they
are then you should inform the administrator that there seems to be a
problem with the IMAP server's setup as it isn't working.

Cheers,

I think not. At least versions 3.91-3.93 use Character set from your
.pinerc only if the message being sent out contains at least one characte=
r
with code > 127. This `optimalization' is done for two reasons:

1) If there is no char > 127, then US-ASCII label is true (and more
appropriate).

2) There is no reason to tag message containing no 8bit characters as
ISO-8859-2 making all recepients start apecial programs in case there are
no in the area using the mentioned character set.

By the way, your (?) WWW pages about ISO Latin 2 support are very nice.

A quick check of the man page for Pico reveals the command line option...

	-w   Disable word wrap (thus allow editing of long lines).

I would like to print the list of messages I have in my inbox.  I know how
to print the messages, but I want to print the list of messages and cannot
seem to do that.  Is there a way to print the list?  Thanks.

You didn't say which version of Pine is being used! :-(

If it is Pine 3.91 or earlier...
... you can't.

If it is Pine 3.92 or later...
... go to the Folder Index screen and type "Y".  You'll then be offered
the choice of printing the index or the current message.

The current version of Pine is 3.94.

Cheers,

    I have not actually done this myself, but have you tried enabling
aggregate commands in your configuration (enabling the semi-colon
command)?  Then, when you open your mailbox, start the aggregate command
with ;, enter A to affect All messages, another A to Apply a command,
and then try S to Save all of them into some other folder (and at the
same time deleting them from the INBOX).  As I say, I haven't done it,
but it may be worth a try.  (Remember that you have to enable aggregate
commands in your configuration.)

    With the newest versions of Pine, a terminological confusion has
come into play.  Prior to Pine 3.93, when people talked about
"filters," usually they were referring to mail filters in a generic
sense which had nothing specifically to to with Pine as such but with
email processing in general.  This is probably what people who have
been around even a relatively short time think of concerning the word
"filter" in connection with email.  I did, and that's how I took
Carolann Mercer's inquiry.  (I use procmail quite effectively and
simply have had no reason to go looking for new such capability within
Pine itself.)

    However, Pine 3.93 introduced some kind of "filter" of it's own,
which I have not even had any reason to look at.  I'm not even sure
what it does.  What has happened is that the terminological waters have
gotten muddied up with Pine 3.93's use of "filter" when commonly, up to
that point and outside Pine's own, narrow world, "filter" had its own
(possibly different) meaning.  If Pine 3.93/3.94 can in fact "filter"
mail in the non-Pine sense, then I stand corrected and encourage those
more knowledgeable about the new capability to enlighten us.

    Terry Gray, are you there?

Suzanne,
Mike is absolutely correct (as usual)!  I was indeed thinking of the
*automatic* handling of Undisclosed recipients...

Yes I am using 2.1f, and it made no difference when I changed from
2.0b.  

I am running Lantastic 5 with packet drivers for DOS (the DOS version of
PINE does work) and then run winpkt and Trumpet.

Paul,
Pine's use of the term filter follows from Unix filters, circa 1969,
so that usage long predates the term as applied to procmail-like
"mail filtering"...

But you are entirely correct: Pine still does not do "mail filtering" in
the sense of separating incoming messages into different folders.  We view
this as best done at the time the message is delivered, rather than when
the Mail User Agent (e.g. Pine) is invoked.  So procmail and similar
programs are still the recommended solution for this need.

Pine's filters are for special processing of a message at the point it is
displayed or sent.  Examples might include character set manipulation or
encryption/decryption.

The headers From, Reply-To, To, cc, bcc, and Lcc are the only ones looked
up.

The previous version tried to be smart and also expand the non-standard
return-receipt-to header.  Now that is just treated like text.

    This is the Pine newsgroup, and I cannot speak about Elm.  Do you
mean, is there a way to get some confirmation back that the recipient
has actually opened and read the mail?  No.  There are no Internet-
wide standards for this sort of thing.  Some proprietary mail systems
(may like Pegasus Mail? which I am unfamiliar with) may do it, but that
works only among users hooked together and using that same proprietary
mail system.  Internet-wide you're out of luck.  Sorry.

I get this weird 'Bug in Pine' when I try to connect to my POP3 server.
Pine (3.91, Linux) asks for my username and for my password, and then
stops and gives that message.

What is this? Can something be done? (Don't say I should upgrade; I
can't until there's a newer Pine in Slackware. I'm not a unix guru,
as you've probably guessed ;-)

Subject: Bug in Pine under Solaris 2.5?
Date: 17 Jun 1996 14:00:05 GMT
Message-Id: <HARP.96Jun17100005@utkux4.utk.edu>


Since we upgraded our machines from Solaris 2.4 to 2.5, we've seen
very problems with Pine.  If a user leaves Pine open for a little
while (somewhere between 10 minutes and 4 hours), they will receive an
error message saying:

	[MAIL FOLDER "INBOX" CLOSED DUE TO ACCESS ERROR]

This has only happened since we went to 2.5 and it occurs in all of
the following versions of pine:  3.91, 3.92, 3.93 and 3.94.

There is another message users get every once in a while that
resembles:

	Unable to find newline at XXX in XXX bytes.

Both of these problems appear to be problems in handling tenex format
mail files.  In fact, users that do not use the tenex format have not
had any of these problems.  I have a strong hunch that Pine's tenex
format handling routines and NFS version 3 don't exactly get along
very well.  The only major change I can see that we made when moving
from Solaris 2.4 to Solaris 2.5 was the change in the version of NFS
we use.  Has anyone else seen either of these problems?

If the mail check interval is set to zero, the manual methods of checking
for new mail still work.  In particular, a Next Message command (n or
control n or down arrow) will cause a new mail check if you are at the
last message of a folder.  Also, control L will cause a new mail check. 
Could that be what is happening?  Thanks.

You could try to go to the dir /var/spool/mail and then copy the file
named jrespler.  If you copy it into the directory where your other mail
files are, then you should be able to pull it up as you would any other of
your mail folders.  You could then delete the original inbox (i.e. 
jrespler) from /var/spool/mail. (And then start from scratch with no
messages in your inbox....)

At least I know this has worked for me in my account. 

However, I was trying to do the same thing for someone else in an account 
with a different provider, and could not find the file for that account's 
inbox.  Are there other likely places to look besides /var/spool/mail for 
one's inbox?

elm doesn't have this. There is ongoing work about a standard for this.
 
Here are two URLs which might be of interest:
http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/html.charters/receipt-charter.html
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-receipt-mdn-01.txt
Maybe someone implements this in elm or pine when it is an RFC?

e-mail spam can ruin the usefulness of the net  for floks such as myself.
(and I suspect most humans on planet earth as well)

The spammers are now using fake addresses, so that sending them their own
message (copied 50+ times, of course:-)  returns with a message saying
that no such party exists.

Is there a newsgroup for this ?  Is there software to help ?

I think that email spam is something to cut now, before it really ruins
the net.   ("ruin", of course, in my  dictionary definition; you are
welcom to disagree about receiving 20 times more spam than requested
email)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I don't know whether this is the place to ask this question but I believe 
that you could possibly help me with this.  What do I need to do with my 
setup as a PINE user to get a return note each time the receipient read 
my email? Long time ago when I was using the Mainframe instead of the 
PINE on Unix, I was able to just do that by setting a setup option.  But 
I cannot find the same in PINE.

Also, if I want to send the same message to a group of people and don't 
want to use "Cc:" for fear of offending those who are just on the Cc: 
list, can I create a dedicated address directory for such a group so that 
every time when I send a message to all the group members, I only need to 
input the directory name?

Thank you for your attention.

K. Edwin Lee

I'm using Pine 3.91 on UNIX to maintain UseNet newsgroups. It seems to me 
that to clear out a specific newsgroup, I have to delete each item 
individually, with the D command. Is there some way to clear out a 
selected newsgroup in one fell swoop on Pine's main screen?

Dear Friends,

What are the various options available to
upgrade Pine 3.91 to the latest verson 3.94 ?

Are (can) the local servers (be) involved in
the process ?

Thanks in advance.

I think I can help you,  I don't know the differences of PC pine to Unix
Pine, but here I go.  In the configuration there is a feature called
enable-aggregate-command-set this feature allows you to use the ";"
(semicolon) to select messages by to:, form:, date, number, all,
etc...then you can use the A command which will 'apply' other commands to
the selected messages (i.e. save, forward, reply, etc...).
Then to have that one folder sort automatically by date:  in the
configuration screen there is a feature that you can set the sort key to
what ever you want, in your case you want it by date :

sort-key               =
            Set       Sort Options
            ---   ----------------------
            ( )  Date               
            (*)  Arrival
            ( )  From
            ( )  Subject
            ( )  OrderedSubj
            ( )  Reverse Date

            ( )  Reverse From

So, does this mean I can't use Pine's filters as a kill file for
reading my newsgroups by having files with the undesired topics
shunted off to the temporary file for deletion after the session is
over?

Thanks Rick, but after you use mpack, how I can send the encoded file
say via Mail so that Eudora or pine would understand the mail as a
multiple part attachment?

    I am not 100% certain of the meaning of your question, but I will
make a guess.  Are you saying that when you send a posting to a
newsgroup, "To: <newsgroup name>" appears when you look at the
newsgroup itself, while other postings have the names of the senders? 
If this is what you are seeing, then the answer is that this is the way
Pine works.  It was designed to do this.

    Compare email.  Usually you see whom a message is FROM, but if you
yourself sent the message, you already know whom it is from -- yourself
-- so Pine changes this to "To: <recipient name>".  Pine tries to
handle mail and news similarly, so it does the same thing with news. 
In other words, nothing is broken: this is how Pine was designed to
act.

    However, I think that in the very most recent versions of Pine,
3.93 and 3.94, you can change this behavior, although I do not have the
exact details with me.  Check the documentation for those two
releases.

Any chance of a patch from 3.13 to 3.14, thus saving the large download from
the other side of the world.

Jolly good ... However the thousands of people around the world you have
just sent your query to are unlikely to know the ins and outs of your
system and how it system administrators implement and assign disk quotas.

Try asking your local help desk for assistance... :-)

What you say is true: when you have "finished with" a Usenet News article
you should "delete" it from the newsgroup using the "D" command.  (In
practice this means "delete it from the displayed list of articles; it
remains on the news server so that others can still read it.  Indeed you
can see it again yourself by using the "&" (Unexclude) command at a later
time.)

So its is better to use "D" as you read News, when you have finished with
an article.

If you want to perform a "catch-up" and mark all messages in a newsgroup
as read (or just a subset of them) you can do this using Pine's aggregate
commands.  These are three commands for applying a command to a set of
messages, be they in mail or news folders.

0.  Go to the Setup Configuration screen ("S" then "C" from the Main Menu)
    and select the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature.  This will
    remain in effect, so you won't need to do this step in the future.

1.  Go to the Index screen of the mail folder/newsgroup in question.

2.  Choose a set of the messages by giving the Select (;) command followed
    by an option from the menu.  (Eg, ";A" will select all the messages)

3.  Apply a command to the selected set by giving the Apple (A) command
    followed by a command from the menu.  (Eg, "AD" will apply a delete
    command to the selected messages)

If you used the example commands (";AAD") then you will have marked all
the messages in the folder/newsgroup as deleted.  They will (permanently)
be deleted from a mail folder when it is closed, or hidden from the index
of a newsgroup when you next open the group.  You can force this to happen
without closing and re-opening the folder/newsgroup by giving the
Expunge/Exclude (X) command.

Select (;) and Apply (A) are two of the three aggregate commands.  The
thirs is Zoom (Z) which hides all unselected messages from the Index.  A
subsequent Zoom will redisplay them.  This is handy if you want to
concentrate on a particular set of messages.  For example, if you have a
lot of messages including many from the Pine-Info mailing list you can
concentrate on the latter by...

	;TT pine-info		...Select messages based on the Text To
				   field containing the string "pine-info"

	;BTC pine-info		...Select a Broader set based on the Text
				   CC field containing the string
				   "pine-info"

	Z			...Temporarily hide all unselected
				   messages

	$O			...Sort the messages into Ordered Subject
				   order

	^W^Y			...Go to the first message (then start
				   reading!)

This is actually quite a mouthful, but can become second nature (or be
programmed into a terminal emulator's function key!).  Each morning I use
the somewhat simpler command sequence to read my mail...

	;SN Z $O ^W^Y

(Whose description is left as an exercise to the reader -- I've always 
wanted to say after suffering it in Maths text books! :-)

There isn't a way for you to FORCE the recipient's mail software to return
an acknowledgement to you upon message receipt and/or reading.  At best
you can include some special headers in the message you send out that
REQUESTS their mail software to do so.

However many mail programs (including Pine) do not recognise or support
these headers in incoming messages, and take no special action when they
receive a message including them.  Other mail software may support the
headers, but have the response action disabled by the individual or system
administrator (perhaps because they view it as an invasion of their
privacy).

[I find it interesting that so many people want/expect such
acknowledements from e-mail they send out, but wouldn't expect such a
facility from letters sent through conventional postal mail!]

You need to read about "Distribution Lists" in Pine.  These are ways of
listing a number of e-mail addresses under a single nickname; by using the
nickname it expands out to the whole list of recipients.

The best way to use such a distribution list (especially to hide the fact
the you're "only" CC-ing people is:

0.  Use Pine 3.93 or later (3.94 is the current version).
1.  Start composing your message, but leave the "To:" and "Cc:" fields
    empty.
2.  Put the cursor on a header field and type ^R to see the Rich Header
    with all the available possible fields.
3.  Put your distribution list nickname into the "Lcc:" field.
4.  Now type your message into the Message Text area and send.

You can read more about distribution lists in the Address Book screen ("A"
from the Main Menu) by typing "?" there.

More information about "Lcc" is available by putting the cursor on the
"Lcc:" field and typing "^G" (Get Help).

1.  Use anonymous ftp to connect to ftp.cac.washington.edu
2.  cd to the /pine directory

I have two signature files one of which is automatically included when I
compose a message. The other file contains my home address too. Sending
private e-mail, I delete the default signature and then include the
"private" signature by means of the ^R Read File command.

Where do I place a global pinerc file for PC Pine (for Win-16), and how do
I call it, on a PC that is used by several persons for e-mail?

Sometimes that means their account has been closed *grin*, but I guess
it's more often fake. Check the headers of the message you got for other
addresses it may actually have come from.

It is probably more effective to send 1 mail with copy to their postmaster
than 50 just to the spammer. Remember, there are probably thousands of
others doing the same.

For newsgroup spams, at least, there is news.admin.net-abuse.misc.
Emails are discussed there too sometimes.  I am sure there are other fora
for email spams as well - I seem to recall rumors about Web blacklists.

Greetings,
rjan.

  Normally you wouldn't alter sendmail to handle quotes.  Sendmail doesn't
really deal with users, it uses the local mail delivery program to do that.
If you slapped a quota on sendmail, the effect would be global and not
user specific (and probably only relate to the total queue size).

  Hacking your local mail delivery agent is much easier.  It gets the
data and makes the delivery (or not) and tells sendmail if it succeeded
or failed.  Right now, it is probably trying to deliver the mail as root
(which might be why the quota-check is failing), but you can fix that.

  One person I know hacked it so that senders would get a quota-specific
bounce message if the receiver was over their disk quota.

If I go to the Folder screen with L and then type Y, pine3.94  gives me no
choice. Pine says: Print folder list ...
If I go to the mailindex of any folder I can only print one mail.

Ah-ha!

In that case you need to go to the Setup Configuration screen and select
the "print-index-enabled" feature.  (I thought it was on by default, but
had forgotten I had set it on in our systemwide defaults file:-)

Subject: How doe pine actually do mime attachment?
Date: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 03:12:43 GMT
Message-Id: <4q59bj$bb1@ruby.hknet.com>

Dear all,

I want to send a number of people pdf files as mime attachments.
Presumably they are all using Eudora.  At the moment I am doing this
by hand from Eudora.  I was wondering whether I could do this from
within a shell script?  I presume pine creat the text to mail and
somehow pipes it to sendmail.  I have download the source
code, I am currently looking at send.c (is that the right place?).

Thank you

Correct.  Kill files are not yet supported, and procmail-like tools only
apply to mail, not news.  Sorry...

   Thanks Rick, but after you use mpack, how I can send the encoded file
   say via Mail so that Eudora or pine would understand the mail as a
   multiple part attachment?

I can only speak for the Unix version of mpack.  Invoking it with a -o
option creats a file with the MIME headers & separators all set up.  In
fact, this file can then be passed to sendmail, specifying a recipient,
as in

   /usr/lib/sendmail recipient@somewhere.domain < filename

Pine does fine reading a mailed test message formed this way.

Well, I figured how to solve my problem after reading the ISO-8859-X FAQ.
I guess I was lucky that I had the previous version of pine working the
way I wanted without the following on my .cshrc file:


#--- To enable proper handling of ISO characters

tty -s
 if ($status == 0) stty cs8 -istrip -parenb

#---

Recently I tried to reply to a message in Usenet, but after going
through all the steps required by PINE to "reply", I got a message
which said, in effect, that my reply was longer than the original
message, and so my reply wouldn't be sent!  When I went back and
shortened the original message to which I was replying, then my reply
went through!  

Is there a way to override this feature?  I suppose it's designed to
conserve bandwidth...and I know we get tired of seening repeats of
mesages, but...!!  Is there a way to turn off the "show message which
is being replied to" in replys, in Usenet, but not in regular e-mail
messages??!!

Thanks!

Katie

to the pine developers: GREAT job. I love the new version, it is so fast
compared to 3.91. I've deleted > 2000 messages in < 1 second on a
486/66dx2 Linux box.

But...

I get this when I am in pine 3.94, composing mail to someone (like, say
right now :) "No room for file: No such file or directory" at the bottom
of my screen.  I sorted throught the src code, and it looked like that
error wasn't in the pine src tree, but the pico src tree.  The error
appears in os_unix.c:      emlwrite("No room for file: %s", err_str);  

This error seems to appear every few minutes, so I am guessing pico is
trying to save a temporary file somewhere maybe that it isn't allowed.  

I'm not quite sure what to make of this, and haven't seen this error on
pine 3.91 (which is what came with the slackware 3.0.0 linux installation
I am on), or 3.93, just in 3.94.

Any help/suggestions would be very much appreciated.

Thanks!

Okay, sometimes people send me Email from the PC, specifically using Eudora.
When I use Pine, on a UNIX system, I can read the mail just fine, but if 
I try to reply to it, the soft-carriage returns go away and I need to 
re-justify the text manually all through the message.  Does anybody know 
how to fix this problem?  Thanks.

Have a nice day.

I need information on how to help a friend of mine; when he brings up an
email letter to read only the bottom half is displayed--if you "previous
page" the logo of our freenet comes up - sorta like the letter is tucked
under the logo.  Also, the menu from "Inbox" is interspersed throughout
the letter being read.

I am writing from my call-sign since it would be impossible to read any
answer he might get from you on his own account.

Thanks.                         Jean Glick

H,

	My users want the POP3.  Whan you work with pine the modem
	hold the line all the session - it's mony.  The other mailer
	works with POP3 load the inbox to local machine and hungup the
	phone-line.  After you finish compose,read,.. it redail automatic
	and sent the messages in one pass.

	With pine you do it manuel: open local folder-colection, select
	and save the inbox.....

B,
 Udi

It means you're running an older version of SunOS than that which was used
to compile pine.   You can do any one of a number of things:

	1) Rebuild pine for your current OS revision.
	2) Upgrade your OS
	3) copy the newer /usr/lib/libc.so.1.9 to your system's /usr/lib
	   directory.
	4) Copy libc.so.1.9 into /usr/local/lib and make sure your
	   environment has LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable set such that it
	   includes /usr/local/lib.
	5) Put up with the warning message - it doesn't cause any real
	   problems.

My personal preference is (4)...


	- Mike

Hello,

I've been attempting to port Pine (3.94) to the Cray/Unicos platform
(Ugh!)...  I've been successfull so far, with one major exception...
When I attempt to go into the addressbook, it complains about the
addressbook lookup file, and tries to rebuild it (several times, with
several different error messages), then gives up.  Among them:

    [Addrbook has been changed by another process, need to re-sync...]
    [Lookup file .addressbook.lu inconsistent...remove it and restart Pine]

When I look at the .addressbook.lu file I see the following:

P#*E@ 14        100
18446744073709551615 18446744073709551615      480909    88213887        0
18446744073709551615 18446744073709551615     6972158   123621272       36
18446744073709551615 18446744073709551615       28925   123633824       74
18446744073709551615 18446744073709551615       31058   214884217      112
...

In a working .addressbook (from pine 3.93 on Solaris 2.4), the same
.addressbook creates the following .lu file:

P#*E@ 12        100
4294967295 4294967295      480909    88213887          0
4294967295 4294967295     6972158   123621272         36
4294967295 4294967295       28925   123633824         74
4294967295          1       31058   214884217        112
...

Is this at all familiar to anyone???

I've included the .pine-debug file as an attachment.  Thanks in advance
for any pointers.

	- Mike

Dear Sir,

Can anyone point me to eliminate this problem.  Normally, PINE will ask
user whether he want to move sent-mail to sent-mail-???-??? or not on
every new month.  If user say no, this message will disappear until next 
month.  

But On my system if user say 'No'  it will ask this same question
everytime he use pine again!!  So this mean If I don't want to move the
folder, I have to answer 'No' everytime I use PINE,  Oh help me please.. 
Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,
Suwat P.

Hi,

	If you have this alias in your shell or entry in your .twmrc
	you can use the mouse to cut&paste + select with pine:

alias   xpine   'xterm -name pine -e pine &'


	Now, you need this entry in .Xresource or .Xdef:


pine*VT100.Translations: #override !<Btn2Down>: string(0x0d) \n\
                                   !<Btn3Down>: string(O) \n\
                !Shift <Btn1Down>: select-start() \n\
              !Shift <Btn1Motion>: select-extend() \n\
                  !Shift <Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\
                !Shift <Btn3Down>: start-extend() \n\
              !Shift <Btn3Motion>: select-extend() \n\
                                   <BtnUp>:select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)


	Botton 1 play the pine's select/exec
	Button 2 play like user's "enter"
	Button 3 play like user's "o"
	While you hold the Shift, buttons 1,2,3 will play the X11's cut&past

Bye,
 Udi

A quick guess:  Try taking a look in pine/os.h to see if the typedef for
usign32_t looks correct.  Perhaps an int is 64 bits under Unicos?  You
need a 32-bit integer type there.

In the setup config menu (at the main menu type S (setup) and C
(configuration)), there is a feature called enable-aggregate-command-key.
If you select this is allows you to use the ; (select) and A (apply)
commands.  What you do is (I hope these messages are in the same folder)
at the message index type ';' to select by number, form, to, etc.. the
type A  (apply) and apply the eXport command and this will export all of
the selected messages to the file you specify.

Hope this helps!

Whenever I try to print a file that is more than one page in length, whole
lines, paragraphs, etc. get left out.  I normally press "y" twice in order
to execute the printing.  Any help you can extend is appreciated.\

Thanks in advance.

Can someone tell me how to display the name of the recipient
of my mail (rather than my name) in the sent-mail folders?

The recent upgrade to Pine 3.91 seems to have changed this
default setting.

Sincerely,

Andrew Lewis

Andrew,
Do the "From: " header lines in your sent-mail folder
say the same thing as the To: line on this message,
i.e. Andrew Lewis <ajlewis@chaph.usc.edu>
or something different?

And I'm going to assume the upgrade was *from* version 3.91...

Subject: Help - Pine 3.94 broke my keymapping...
Date: 17 Jun 1996 21:26:44 GMT
Message-Id: <4q4iik$2al@News.Dal.Ca>

I've been using pine for a couple of years for e-mail, and I find it
excellent.  I run an X-server on a Win95 machine, and had set up
key-mapping to use accented characters. I had character-set=ISO-8859-1
set, and was able to read and send my messages with no problems.  Today
our version of pine was updated, and now when I press the keys that would
result in accented characters, I don't get them!

The key-mapping still works for all the other applications, including
pico, which was also updated (to version 2.8). 

Does anyone have any idea of what went on there?

Thanks in advance

Hi! It's me again. Now that I can send my attachments from Netscape and
have them readable I have a follow-up question.

I send quite a few of these. When my boss replies, though, the original
just shows the Netscape address. In order to know which message she is
replying to I have to go back and look at each one to match the Netscape
address. (At least I've started keeping a copy of all the messages for
myself.)

Is there a way I can view the attachment from within the reply? Also, when
I re-forward those messages to others, all they get is the Netscape
address. Is there a way I can make sure they can view the Netscape
attachment? (I have already tried using the view attach <V> command but it
just shows me the address.)

Thanks......

I asked about IMAP before signing up with an ISP. The ISP I signed up

Don,

I suppose that you use precompiled SunOS binaries and your own SunOS
has an older release.
To stop the error message you can do the following as root:

ln -s /usr/lib/libc.so.1.8 /usr/lib/libc.so.1.9
ldconfig

hope this helps

This is nothing to do with Pine, but the way your systems administrator
has configured your Usenet News server.

These servers can be set up to check the content of articles people post
to them and ensure that there is at least a certain percentage of new
material compared to quoted text.  (The idea is to try and encourage
people to edit down included text and supply new, useful material ...
instead of quote a multi-page posting only to add "I agree" at the end.)

If the news server receives such a posting it is refused and an error
message returned.  Pine is simply reporting this error message to you.

Solution: reduce the amount of quoted text, or write some more meaningful
information!

As for your other question, it is not possible to set up the "include
text" option to behave differently between Usenet and regular e-mail.
(Things get very hazy when, for instance, you save a Usenet article into a
folder -- remember these can contain ANY message be it Usenet or e-mail.
Once there should it be treated as a Usenet article or an e-mail?  This
has been discussed many times in the past (so please let's not go over it
all again!).)

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

This is a well-known bug in 3.91 version. About 1.5 year ago some patches
went through this mailing list/newsgroup. Try to search archives and apll=

the patch recompiling the pine again; or ...

... upgrade to 3.94. As there are already precompiled versions for variou=
s
systems (including linux) on ftp.cac.washington.edu you do not need to be
an expert. IMHO the second solution is much better.

Hi, we are looking to back up our mail system and need direction

something called 'back-p', does anyone here know of such? Would it be
useful in this case?

Hello,

I wonder if the environment variable MAIL is supported by pine to use it

mounted not under the system's default mailbox path.

Sure can - First, uuencode the file in the usual way (to encode a file
named file in the current directory, label it as 'file', and place it in a
file called file.uu, the usual syntax would be something like:
prompt% uuencode file file > file.uu   ).

Then, start PINE, address the message, and enter your comments.  at the
bottom of the message (on a blank line), use Ctrl-R to read the file into
the message, and enter the file name when it asks "File to insert..." 

Then send the message in the usual manner.

Cheers,

Don Miller

Dear pine,
i need real help, here.  For three weeks, I was away, and no one used my 
machine or modem.  Now, upon my return, my screen with pine are not a 
match.  The repainting does not happen properly when I try to switch from 
item to item, I can't read my eamil completely, the keyboard does not 
resond properly to my typing, the words won't space correctly, and I 
can't get it to repaint or fix itself.  For example, this message is 
being typed over yours, since I couldn't get it to unpaint yours even 
though I chose Compose from the menu.  

HELP.

Create your two files. You can save one as s1 and the other as s2. Then
when sending mail you can read in either one of the files using the Ctrl R
command (Read File). When prompted, enter either s1 or s2 and the file
will appear at the end of your email.

In fact, it seems to me  that pine 
"forgets" to decode the QP (whatever the
character set). I've sent a bug report.

Message-Id: <4q4p27$hsg@mozo.cc.purdue.edu>


I tried to reply to a usenet message using PINE 3.9, but got a message
which said, in effect, that my reply couldn't be posted because it (my
message) was shorter than the included message to which I was trying
to  reply (I have my PINE options set so I see the message I'm
replying to below the space where I type in my message).  

When I went back and deleted part of the original message (i.e.,
shortened it) to which I was replying, then my reply went through!  

Is there a way to override this feature?  I suppose it's a way to save
bandwidth?!

Thanks!
Katie

I have seen some discussions in alt.security.pgp group.  There is no cure 
in the foreseeable future, I am afraid.  The only way for you to avoid
spamming is to hide your own identidy (email address, that is).  It is a
sad situation for those being spammed, not for those spamming others.

There are tools that help the spammers, and they are very handy.  There
are some tools that are useful, but to limited degree, for the spammed.
Mail filter programs can screen out emails from certain addresses and
delete them so that you don't have to bother reading them after you have
identified the address by the first spamming email.  Anonymous reflectors
can help you to hide your identity.  You probably cannot post to local 
newsgroups that the anonymous service does not cover.  Your favorite lists
may not appreciate anonymous users so that you may have to give up some of
your favorite subscriptions.  The inconvenience is not too bad considering
you will not be spammed any more.

Email address is just like your home address or phone number.  There are
always ways for spammers to abuse it.

Just my 2c.

Sometimes, tabs in my email get screwed up in the recipients end.

UUENCODE the file outside of Pine, then use ^R to read the encoded file

A stupid solution that replaces every tab character by fixed number of
spaces:

Install the following line as your sending filter (pine 3.92 or newer
required) and set the feature which defaults to automatic use of the firs=
t
filter on sending the mail (replace `@' by <tab> charcater and `****' by
appropritate number of spaces).

sed -e 's/@/****/g'

`Smarter' solution counting th eactual column requires more programming.

Oversight, I'm afraid!  For this particular port, simply uncommenting the
"BACKGROUND_POST" definition should be all that is required to enable this
feature.

I have downloaded an xbm file for pine, but I can't find any information

Can some clever person please tell me how to do this?

(I am using pine3.94 on a Sun SPARC system, running SunOS 4.1.3).


Thanks in advance,

Is there a way to configure the news reader to go back to the alphabetical
list of groups?  When I am in the index of a specific news group, and want
to return to the general list, I have to go back to the folder list first.
I find this inconvenient, and have not been successful in finding a
conguration in my setup to control it.

I'm in a situation where I need to be able to easily change the reply-to
address depending on where and for what reason I am sending a message.

In the pine config I see an option for "reply-always-uses-reply-to"
but I can't find a place to specify reply-to addresses.

Well, since one person asked if anyone else sent me a solution, here is my

We want do our local user address expansion at sendmail time, and not have
pine add the qualified host address to everyone's login, be it a single
address message, a message to an addressbook list, or whatever. Has anyone
else done this and if so, could you send me context diffs, pointers to
config file changes if possible, etc?

If you put a :; (a colon and a semicolon)in the to: field and the list in
the Bcc field the people will not see the list.  If you want to be able to
see what they see include yourself in the list and it will mail you a copy
just like how anyone else would receive it.

Hope this helps!

Is it possible to set up pine in such a way that it will display the

You could try putting it in the custom headers section, which you could 
then pull up with control-R and add one if you needed it ... if you 
always have a reply-to you could put it in default headers and then  it 
should always come up. 

I have added a number of custom headers myself, but left things blank to 
the right of the : so I can easily pull up a list of different headers 
and add the ones I need on the offtime I may need something like that...

Pine should be able to do that "out of the box", except for a warning
message which you get rid of by going to Setup Config and adding

character-set            = ISO-8859-1

So if you have problems with displaying, it is probably somewhere else.

First of all you must have your terminal set up to use the
ISO-8859-1/Latin-1 character set. Then (this is for Unix only, I don't
know otherwise) put the following in your .cshrc or .bashrc, or a modified
version if you don't use either of those shells:

.cshrc (for csh and tcsh, in the last case the file may be .tcshrc)
------
tty -s
if (! $status) then
        stty cs8 -istrip -parenb 
endif


.bashrc: (or .profile if you are using sh)
--------
if tty -s; then
        stty cs8 -istrip -parenb >&0
fi

If you still have problems, check out the ISO-8859-1 FAQ, posted
to news.answers and assorted soc.culture groups, soc.culture.french
probably included.

Greetings,
rjan.

I'm happy to inform you that there already exists a tool to do exactly
what you're trying do.  It's called "metasend", and I believe it comes
with the "metamail" package.

It's very easy to use; for instance, if I wanted to send a file to
you called "my.pdf" and have "a file" as the subject of the mail
message, I would simply write:

    metasend -b -m application/pdf -f my.pdf -s "a file" -t anthony@hknet.com

Simple, eh?

Running on a Pc with Novell's winsock , if you close an iconised pine,
then next time pine restarts, it draws the full screen starting from the
iconised position, rather than full screen starting from its last
full-screen coordinates


The reslut of this is that (since the icon is normally at the bootom of
the screen) the pine titla bar and little else shows.

A nuisance rather than a disater

Message-Id: <4qb4i1$c5d@chaos.kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be>

Hello,

I am trying on Windows 3.11 with Pine 3.94 a setup so that the same
pinerc file can be used by successive students sitting after the
same PC.

I tried to set in PINERC user-id to the Empty Value (""), which
works fine.  However, I get also user-id and password prompts
the first time sent-mail  savemail postponed folders are used,
while all the folders and the inbox are on the same host.	
How can I make that userid and password is only prompted once ?

PINERC:

user-id=""
user-domain=imap.kul.be
smtp-server=imap.kul.be
inbox-path={imap.kul.be}inbox
folder-collection=blbla {imap.kul.be}mail/[]
default-fcc=sent-mail
default-saved-msg-folder=savemail
....

I'm sorry, but I don't know much about computer programming, and my 
account does not allow me access to any of this unix perl stuff.  What I 
really need is a utility similar to the uuencode/decode and zip/unzip 
utilities widely available for DOS and Windows; one that is capable of 
dealing specifically with the "quoted printable" encoding scheme.  Is 
there such a thing.

Anyway, thanks for the information.

Hi,
	I was wondering if there is a way to map keys in pine ( an 
equivalent to the map lines in .exrc for UNIX mail ).  Thank you in 
advance for your help.

In the setup config menu (at the main menu type S (setup) and C
(configuration)), there is a feature called enable-aggregate-command-key. 
If you select this is allows you to use the ';' (select) and A (apply)
commands.  What you do is (I hope these messages are in the same folder) 
at the message index type ';' to select by number, from, to, etc.. the
type A (apply) and apply the eXport command and this will export all of
the selected messages to the file you specify or apply the save command
and save all the messages to another folder(named backup copies)(it will
ask you if you want to create that folder once you type in the name). (the
save may be better for you if you are going to delete them in the inbox
and may still need to reply to them. 

Hope this is what you are looking for.

I don't know of any way to do this. You may want to post to 
pine-info@cac.washington.edu and ask them, since this is a "generic" pine 
question. if there is a way to do it, they would know.

   I need information on how to help a friend of mine; when he brings up an
   email letter to read only the bottom half is displayed--if you "previous
   page" the logo of our freenet comes up - sorta like the letter is tucked
   under the logo.  Also, the menu from "Inbox" is interspersed throughout
   the letter being read.

I assume your friend is also running pine on a Sun.

It sounds to me as if the Unix host doesn't know what window size your
friend is using.  He can get its view of the situation by entering 'stty
-a' and looking for rows and columns values, or (depending on the
operating system) something like 'echo "$COLUMNS"; echo "$LINES"'.

If the values are wrong, they can be reset by means of commands such as

	stty rows 24 columns 80
	setenv LINES 24			# csh syntax
	LINES=24; export LINES		# sh syntax
	eval `resize`			# under X (not guaranteed)

Your local sysadmin may have additional advice.

Hope this helps,

Hi,

I have Linux kernel 2.0, and pine won't build:
gcc -O4 -N    -DLNX -DSYSTYPE=\"LNX\" -DMOUSE   -c os.c -o os.o
os.c: In function `canonical_name':
os.c:1013: warning: return discards `const' from pointer target type
os.c: In function `post_reap':
os.c:1740: warning: passing arg 2 of `waitpid' from incompatible pointer
type
make: *** No rule to make target `../c-client/c-client.a', needed by
`pine'.  Stop.

Someone sent in a patch regarding this some time ago, so would someone
please try to incorporate it into new version of pine? Or even make
another build type, like lnx2..

Hynek

I have a file(updated on a weekly basis) that needs to be sent through 
e-mail on a regular basis. I want to use cron to automate the process. Can anyone walk me through how 
to use pine (mailx, elm or mail) to accomplish that.

I hope I'm not getting too far off topic with this one, but I've included
a little script I had to write last year to converts TABs into spaces
while keeping the columns into consideration. Just hand it the original
tab-stop as an argument ("tab2spc 8").

The program only works well on clean text-only ASCII files.

hi.  well, this is a little confusing to me, and maybe you can help me 
with it.  i got an update on pine about two weeks ago.  since then, it 
kinda "disappeared".  and then it came back, then disappeared again, 
without notice.  as of now, i have pine 3.91, instead of pine 3.92 which 
should be the new one.  i was just wondering what happened to my updated 
version of pine.  thanks a lot for your time.

Well, it doesn't *only* work between the users of the same system.  The 
version of (Win) Pegasus Mail that I first used only had a "confirm reading"
option, which would insert a "X-pmrqc: 1" header, recognizable by Pegasus
mail only, AFAIK. The next version also included a "confirm delivery" option
which inserted the well-known "Return-Receipt-To:" header.  Using this option
with users of various mail systems, some with SMTP gateways (cc:mail, MS-Mail,
etc), some without, produced widely varying results. Well, varying from 0-2
confirmations per message.  Sometimes I got a delivery confirmation from the
receiving MDA, indicating only that it was received. I might also get a receipt
when they actually *read* the message.  Sometimes I got nothing.  To confirm that
they actually *read* the message, the MUA needs to support that function, where,
as you implied - you can't count on anything.   Especially for SLIP-based mail
readers.  Doesn't Eudora Pro send a receipt when the msg is fetched from the POP3
server and not when/if the msg is actually read?  I can't remember. And the
shareware Eudora doesn't support (sending) read receipts at all.

Tom,
Concerning your desire to forward a bunch of articles as individual
messages: the latest (3.94) version of Unix and PC-Pine allow you
to "Apply Bounce" to a set of selected messages.  This sounds like what
you'd like.

(Don't know when a VMS version of 3.94 might show up...)

Does anybody know EXACTLY how to download the lastest version of Pine?
When I tried to download it, it came out as a text file. Is this right?

And watch pine crashing... Is this fixed in 3.94? I am back to 3.91 now
because of this bug. 

I have another question too. When using "Sort by Date" it doesn't sort
by the date found in the "Date:" field, it uses instead the "Received:"
field, am I right? 

Example: If I download the mail with pop, it sendmail appends a Received
line with the actual download date and time. It seems that pine uses this
one to sort or select by date which is very annoying. I'd like to use 
the Date field for everything. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. Maybe this will be fixed
in a future release.

Thank you
Andi

Is there a way to have pine read an active news file when using an nntp
connection.  The problem is that whenever I want to subscribe to a new
group, pine has to fetch the list from the server.  This is very time
consuming.  I want to be able to have pine read a file in my home
directory or something instead of going to the server all the time.  I'm
running linux on a 28.8 ppp conection.

Andi,
I can't seem to find your bug report on the uuencode crash, and it
certainly isn't reproducible here.  If you can reproduce it with 3.94,
a stack trace would be most helpful!

As for the date sort, I'm pretty sure your analysis is incorrect, but
without specific header examples it's hard to say what's happening...

I'm trying to change by "From" field in outgoing mail from:

 scrotty@carbon.cudenver.edu
	to
 seancrotty@bigfoot.com

I am using pine from CU-Denver, so it auotmatically gets my address.
Using what I have already found, I've been able to transform the
address to:

 scrotty@bigfoot.com

But I can't figure out how to change my User-ID from "scrotty" to
"seancrotty".

Any suggestions?

Thank You,
Sean

Hello,

Compiling 3.94 on aix4.1 (build a41) produces
tons of errors and finally hangs and never finishes!
(using a32 is not any better,  it also hangs and generates a lot of

I sent the "script" capture to "pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu"
but I got a automated message back!

Can someone from pine development group gets back to me ...

Well, whenever I send an attached binary application using pine 3.93 I get
the following error message:

     [ERROR positioning in /user/terra/droy/dectalk.zip : Invalid argument]
sth                                [Message sent.]

Well, as you can see, it sends the text of my message okay.  However, if I
use pine3.91 which is also on the system, everything works okay.  Anyone
have any ideas?

Please reply to me directly as I don't always have time to monitor the
newsgroup, thanks.

Try one of the Unix commands `expand' or `newform', whichever is
available on your system.

As standard you are not able to change the "From:" field.  Pine is
supplied configured in this way for, I presume, security reasons to reduce
risk of mail forgery.  (It is possible for the systems administrator to
recomp[ile Pine to allow changing the "From:" header.)

Perhaps what you're really after doing is the (much easier) setting up of
a "Reply-to:" header with your normal e-mail address as its value?

You can do this by going to Pine's Setup Configuration screen ("S" then
"C" from the Main Menu).  Then adding a "Customized header" called
"Reply-To: Sean Crotty <seancrotty@bigfoot.com>"

The header will then be available on every message you send and, because
you also set up a value, will be initialised to that value.

Most mail programs will either use of offer to use the Reply-To address in
place of the From field's value.

Cheers,

deja vu - 

There was a long thread a couple of years ago on pine-info about
message confirmation, including which MUAs support (e.g., cc:Mail),
limited MDA support (i.e., system - not recipient - receipts), the pros
and cons (privacy issue), and do-it-yourself receipt scripts.

One thing that got little argument was that putting a request in the
message asking the recipient to acknowledge receipt by sending a reply
message will work with all MUAa and MDAs - but not with all recipients.

ftp to "ftp.cac.washington.edu"
login "anonymous"
send id as password
enter "cd pine/unix-bin"
enter "bin"
enter "prom"
enter "mget *.<os name>"      	for example "mget *.sun" for the sun os
				version

enter "quit"

That should do it.

Subject: PINE DOES NOT WORK!!!!!

We are DESPERATE!!  We have been trying to get pine stable on AIX 4.1 for
several weeks.  We have 150 users that continue to have terminal lock-up
problems throughout the program.  (We are getting 50-75 calls PER DAY on
this problem).

Users are on a variety of Wyse 150, IBM 3151 terminals, and PC's.  PINE
seems to lock up completely, then when we kill the users process, the
terminal's settings have been completely screwed up.  

We have tried PINE 3.93 (compiled using the a32 option) and PINE 3.91, using
the pre-compiled binaries.  NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK. 

I've checked the PINE and AIX FAQ's, as well as the archive for this
mail-list and the newsgroup. 

We're at our wit's end here....

My ISP is having problem with pine 3.94's hanging on background sending on
a SPARC with sun OS. 

Anyone have any info on this?

(I think there was a post the other day about a background sending
problems with Pine 3.94, but I must have deleted it.)

The question has arisen as to whether the HPUX version of Pine is written to 
use shared code in memory so I thought I would see if you could tell me.  

We are looking at Hewlett Pachard system memory requirments and most of
the software we develop for our own system is written to use shared code;
15 people can be running the same piece of code and require little more
memory that one person. It was not sure whether the standard hpp build of 
Pine takes advantage of this or not (not myself being a system programmer 
I'm not sure what the switches are or whether this is even feasible with 
Pine code)

Thanks
Dan

I think it's easier if you just give the mesage id of your post, ie
	<Pine.SGI.3.93.960617095116.12582G-100000@tower.york.ac.uk>
as newsreaders can retrieve posts by this id.
No need to poke around in a newsgroups looking for a post.  :-)

The building should work with gcc, I used that myself. Do this:

Around line 140 in build should be line similiar to this:
     *) makeargs="CC=cc $makeargs" ;;

Modify it to say:
     *) makeargs="CC=gcc $makeargs" ;;


And run build again. :)

   AIX-4.1.4
   PINE-3.94

   Compiling 3.94 on aix4.1 (build a41) produces
   tons of errors and finally hangs and never finishes!
   (using a32 is not any better,  it also hangs and generates a lot of 
   errors).

I have no solution as I get the same results on a41.
osf, hp, sgi, ult, sun and sol compiles just fine.
(sol demanded . in path though, no other did)

If you find a solution I'm very happy if this group gets notified!

Also there is a bug in Pine after v3.91; multilingual characters are
not sorted correctly. Or as the answer from the pine dev. group stated
"Not sorted at all". (Sort by subject).

Message-Id: <4qa3c9$fsr@news.duke.edu>

I'd like to know if their are any differences between the c-client
library distributed with pine 3.94 and that bundled with pine 3.93. 
If necessary, of course, I can diff each of the individual files
between two version distributions. I'll do this if necessary. However,
it would be nice to get a response about this from those more involved
with the software development and maintenance of pine.

Thanks in advance.

I feel like I'm talking to myself. We have a couple Dec Alpha machines
configured to look like one email address to our users. Unfortunately,
stock pine out of the box chooses to fully qualify everyone's address
as alpha1.csd.uwm.edu or alpha2.csd.uwm.edu instead of just csd.uwm.edu,
which is what would show up if pine just let sendmail worry about
qualifying addresses.

Needless to say, I found in init.c where it looks for the hostname and I
clobbered it to return csd.uwm.edu whenever it looks for localhost, which
at the moment looks like it might even work.

To make a change from my usual suggestion that people look in the code
when wanting to reconfigure such things... :-)

Try looking in the Setup Configuration screen at a couple of options that
should let you do exactly what you want without any changes to the source
code.  You'll only need to use one of them: decide which is best for your
environment, then set it up in the systemwide default files (and in the
"fixed" systemwide defaults file if you don't want to let users override 
it in their personal settings).

Of interest to you...

----------
        OPTION: Use-Only-Domain-Name

This option is used only if the "user-domain" option is *not* set.  If set
to "Yes" (and user-domain is not used), then Pine strips the hostname from
your return ("From") address and when completing unqualified addresses
that you enter into the composer. 

If you set this, see also the "quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file" feature. 
----------
        OPTION: User-Domain

This value specifies the domain part (right-hand side) of your return
address on outgoing email and is also used as the default domain for email
composed to a local user.  If unset, Unix Pine will obtain the domain from
the system.  Often this value will be set for your whole site by the
system administrator.

If you set this, see also the "quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file" feature.
----------

So if your machines are all in the "csd.uwm.edu" domain and this is what
you want in the "@ portion" of unqualified e-mail addresses then just set
the "Use-Only-Domain-Name" to "Yes".

However if some of your machines are in a subdomain of "csd.uwm.edu" BUT
they are still to use "csd.uwm.edu" as the "@ portion" then you will
instead need to set "User-Domain" to "csd.uwm.edu".  (Trying to use
"Use-Only-Domain-Name" would result in host.subdomain.csd.uwm.edu using
"@subdomain.csd.uwm.edu" rather than "@csd.uwm.edu".)

Cheers,

Hi,

I brought up an IMAP4 server on my Linux internet server, and an
appropriate IMAP4 client (Pine 3.94) on my Win95 laptop.  Okay, so I am
convinced that IMAP4 kicks POP3 butt for online mail manipulation of remote
and local maildrops.  Nowever, I cannot determine how to do offline replies
on the Win95 client box without resorting to tedious saving of messages to
plain text files, editing each reply in, say, Notepad, then waiting for my
next internet connection to import each text file, edit headers, and send
them off manually one at a time.  Please tell me there is a less painful
way to do this.  Is Pine the answer, or should I try Simeon or Embla?

Best regards,

Valerie,
Pine does not yet support offline mode; it's planned for a future release.

I haven't kept up on which IMAP clients support offline and disconnected
operation, but one that does disconnected (the best of both worlds between
online and offline) is Sun's Roam client:

If you are talking about e-mail messages...

...you can't do this with *any* mail reading program (they are for reading
messages AFTER they have been delivered).  Instead you need to persuade
the mail *delivery* software on your computer to redirect/junk the
messages as they arrive.  Typically this is done using a UNIX program such
as "procmail" or "filter".  Ask your local Help Desk which, if any, of
these are available on your system and how to use them.

If you are talking about Usenet News messages...

...you can't (the current version of Pine doesn't support "kill files").

   Can anyone point me to eliminate this problem.  Normally, PINE will ask
   user whether he want to move sent-mail to sent-mail-???-??? or not on
   every new month.  If user say no, this message will disappear until next 
   month.  

   But On my system if user say 'No'  it will ask this same question
   everytime he use pine again!!  So this mean If I don't want to move the
   folder, I have to answer 'No' everytime I use PINE,  Oh help me please.. 
   Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.

This behavior is ordinarily controlled by the value of
last-time-prune-questioned in your .pinerc file.  I would investigate
whether this file has become read-only and/or whether
last-time-prune-questioned has been set in your system's pine.conf.fixed
file.

In the latter case your system administrator would have to fix the
problem.

Hope this helps,

Are you using unmodified Pine 3.94 sources?

I'm a bit surprised that you're having this problem, since it tends to
imply that your system has two definitions of iovec?!  [We no longer
define it as of 3.94]

Subject: Pine 3.94 patches for DG/UX

Message-Id: <Pine.D-G.3.94.960621133209.17398A-100000@hopi.dtcc.edu>

The below patches make pine 3.94 work beautifully on DG/UX, 4.11, m88k.
I believe it should also work for Intel DG/UX systems, but not so sure
about pre-4.11 boxes, especially pre 3.10.

To apply this patch, unzip and untar the pine distribution from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu, then cd into pine3.94, and finally pipe this file
into patch (make sure to use the -p option.)

For example:

  zcat pine3.94.tar.gz | tar xvof -    # zcat comes standard on 4.11 now
  cd pine3.94
  cat thispatchfile | patch -p

*OR* if you lack the patch program, you can grab the edited files and 
park them manually in place from ftp://hopi.dtcc.edu/pub/dgux/pine/
and place them in

   imap/ANSI/c-client/os_d-g.c
   imap/ANSI/c-client/Makefile
   pine/makefile.d-g
   pine/osdep/os-sv4.h

When you are all done, simply "./build d-g" to hopefully get a successful
pine compile.  (I also put a binary of patch in that directory too,
if you need it.)

Note that this is tested with DG/UX 4.11 under 88k platform. The utime()
controversy still exists "unconditionally" for 88k boxes and can be set to
work the same weird way with intel boxes iff you #define _USEC_UTIME_FLAVOR,
which I did in this patch.  The symptom of this not working right will be
weird messages when quitting pine that the folder time was changed but no
changes were found (paraphrased greatly) and folder times of Dec 31, 1969

If you are using the Solaris operating system (SVR4), try:
	build gso
to build using gcc.

Hi there,

Quick question.

Currently I use pine and have accounts on many different computer
systems. I would like, however, to keep a central archive of all of my
mail, at least all of my outgoing mail. Is there anyway to put a blind
carbon copy in a configuration file such as .pinerc which will do this?

Currently I am just manually doing a bcc everytime I send an email, is
there any easier way of doing this?

Mike

Boy, that is strange.  Any ideas on how I can investigate this further?  
I've had a couple of problems building other software packages 
(xanim27062 and findutils-4.1), and I haven't figured out if the 
problem was also related to iovec, but by far the majority of packages 
that I install have no problems with the build.

I would really appreciate any suggestions...

Subject: making pine auto-check pop3 boxes for new mail
Message-Id: <19960619121351.aaaa004xV@babyblue.cs.yale.edu>
Date: 19 Jun 1996 12:13:55 -0400

This is probably a REALLY stupid question, but what the hey...

I currently use pine 3.94 to check my mail via POP3, using the line:

incoming-folders=valgamon {megahits.com/pop3}

in my .pinerc file. When I used to use pine for local mail on the same
machine, it would automatically alert me when I received new mail, I
didn't have to check for it every couple of minutes. Now that I've got it
set up to use pop3, it doesn't do that anymore. I have to hit TAB from my
inbox every once in a while to see if new mail has arrived. This gets
really annoying after a while.

	Does anyone know how to make pine automatically check pop3 boxes
for newly-arrived mail? Like, once every 30 seconds or something?? tnx.

Subject: MIME attachments, solaris 2.3, pine 3.93
Date: 19 Jun 1996 20:53:13 -0400
Message-Id: <4qa7dp$fus@news.duke.edu>

For several weeks, we've been testing pine 3.93 on several solaris 2.3 sun 
systems and have encountered some difficulty in viewing and sending
MIME attachments. The latter problem is as follows:

1. In the compose message window, the name of a valid ascii text file
is typed after the "attchmnt:" rfc822 header.

2. The message is sent.

3. A highlighted bar appears at the bottom of the window that reads
like this:
		[Sending mail |		0%]
Pine hangs. The highlighted header remains parked at "0%" and is never
updated. The pine process has to be killed in order to regain the shell prompt.

4. Before the process is killed, a scan of the process table reveals
the following:

 root@hector# ps -ef | egrep 'pine|sendmail'
  steven 16320 16317 19 19:52:21 pts/13   0:00 /usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -t
  steven 16317 16307 80 19:50:45 pts/13   0:02 pine393

This indicates that a pipe to /usr/lib/sendmail was opened.

5. Relevant lines from the .pine-debug1 file obtained from running
pine 3.93 at debug level 9 are:

====== context_mailbox: (sent-mail)
cancel_busy_alarm(-1)
Sending mail...
busy_alarm(1, Sending mail, 1120a8, 1)
q_status_message(Sending mail |          |)
output_message(Sending mail |          |)
STATUS cmd:120, max:1, min0
call_mailer: via pipe
Opening pipe: "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -t" (WRNP)
PID: 16328, COMMAND: /usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -t
alarm_signal()
alarm_signal()
    ...

NOTE: the "alarm_signal()" continues indefinitely until the process is
killed. 


	A similar test was performed with pine 3.91. No problems were 
encountered with sending an attachment. Pine 3.91 was also configured
to open a pipe to /usr/lib/sendmail with the same identical flags. The
sendmail program was not changed in any way. The sendmail daemon has
been running reliably for months now. I strongly doubt that there is a
problem here. I did not spot any problems with our mailcap or mime.types
files either. Any ideas or helpful suggestions about this are much
appreciated.

	The problem we experienced with viewing a MIME attachment
involved an rfc822 email message containing an embedded gif file
(image/gif MIME type) rather than a plain ascii text file. This email
message, along with the image/gif attachment, was originally generated
with pine 3.91 . Prior to trying to view the attachment with pine
3.93, it was first successfully viewed with pine 3.91. In other words,
the correct helper application was launched by pine 3.91. 

	When viewing pine 3.93, the gif file was displayed with the
correct helper application. However, after displaying the file, pine
3.93 dumped core and exited. This behavior, radically opposite from
that of pine 3.91, was observed with either of the following entries
in  ~/.mailcap:

		image/*; showpicture -viewer xv %s
or, alternatively,
		image/*; xv %s; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

Relevant lines from the .pine-debug1 file generated from level 9 debug
mode are:

- mc_get_command(Image/GIF) -
mc_ctype_match: trying entry audio/* for Image/GIF
mc_ctype_match: trying entry image/* for Image/GIF
- mc_passes_test -
no test command, so Pass
mc_get_command: type=Image/GIF, command=showpicture -viewer xv %s
- mc_cmd_bldr -
built command: showpicture -viewer xv /usr/tmp/img-GIF015656
cancel_busy_alarm(-1)
exec_mailcap_cmd: command=(showpicture -viewer xv /usr/tmp/img-GIF015656 ; \
rm -f /usr/tmp/img-GIF015656) & (Note: this line is a continuation of \
								above line)

Opening pipe: "(showpicture -viewer xv /usr/tmp/img-GIF015656 ; rm -f \
/usr/tmp/img-GIF015656) & (Note: this line is a continuation of above line)
" (WT)
PID: 15657, COMMAND: (showpicture -viewer xv /usr/tmp/img-GIF015656 ; \
rm -f /usr    (Note: this line is a continuation of previous line)
/tmp/img-GIF015656) &

new mail called (0 2 0)

	As mentioned previously, i'll be performing similar tests on
pine 3.94 soon. However, i'd find it very helpful to understand why
this does not work. Any ideas are much appreciated.

	Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,
Steven McElwee

To get UIDL functionality, substitute the ipop3d server from
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-4.tar.Z
in place of the one that is bundled with Pine.

You can also use the IMAP4 imapd that is with this version, although you
won't get any greater capability with Pine from doing so.

mark as New even those messages which I already have read, but did not deleted

Can anyone offer pointers on what the problem is here and how to fix it?  
Here's what I did to compile:

1) dnld and untar/unzip from /usr2/local/src
2) read stuff.
3) said build clean
4) said build lnx

and this is what I got after the compiler chugged away for awhile:

So it seems that pine, mtest, imapd were not built.

Any ideas?  Thanks!

Hi all-

I just wanted to see if anyone can tell me exactly what needs to be fixed
here.  At the bottom of this message is a copy of a message I posted to
usenet a couple of days ago with no response yet, and then I was browsing
the Pine Discussion Forum Archives and found a very similar problem so I
thought I'd include it for reference. 

The similar article follows immediately:

It looks like you have an unusually broken variant of Linux that doesn't
prevent multiple includes of <sys/uio.h>.  Since there are almost as many
variants of Linux as there are Linux systems, I recommend that you either
run our prebuilt binaries or fix your /usr/include/sys/uio.h to have a
wrapper to prevent it from being included more than once.

We define iovec ourselves in the Linux port because older versions of
Linux have the wrong definition (a void * instead of a caddr_t).

------------------------


My problem is very similar, but that's not obvious from the paste that I
included in the original usenet message, because I didn't paste enough of
the output from make.  Here I correct that, and include what seems to be
the relevant output, and from this you'll see the similarity.  My question
is:  Exactly what do I need to do to fix this "unusually broken variant of
Linux that doesn't prevent multiple includes of <sys/uio.h>"???? 

Is it a library thing or what?  I ask not only because I would like to
build it on my system (sure, I know I could get the binary, but I'd really
rather build it -- it's a principle thing I guess), but also because I
seem to be suffering from a number of build problems in attempting to
install other software too, and if I have an "unusually broken variant of
Linux", then I'd like to fix it.

Anyway, here is the relevant output from make.  The reason that I pasted
all of it this time is that there are several serious-sounding compiler
warnings that occur before the mention of uio.h, and I was wondering if
they are indicative of other problems. 

Here it is:

Subject: Problems building pine 3.94

Can anyone offer pointers on what the problem is here and how to fix it?  
Here's what I did to compile:

1) dnld and untar/unzip from /usr2/local/src
2) read stuff.
3) said build clean
4) said build lnx

and this is what I got after the compiler chugged away for awhile:

So it seems that pine, mtest, imapd were not built.

Any ideas?  Thanks!

Hallo guys

In many messages of me pine in the attches at the end of some lines a
"=20" sequence. I assuemed it was incompatibility with other mail programs
but since it appered in a failed massage I ask my self is it a bug of pine
3.91 or is it a configuration error. 

Does any body have the same problem. I am using pine3.91 on a AIX 4.1.4 
maschine. With the teminals run on Macintosh, PC or HPIX.

I would appiciate replys as PM.

 Bye

            Uwe

There may already be a command "expand" in your system which does this
smarter counting. I use to pipe through that whenever I have used <tab>s
in a message.

Is it possible for me to cancel an e-mail message once I've sent it?

I am just wondering.  Sometimes when you send a message, you get a 
message back sometime later indicating that there was trouble delivering 
the e-mail.  It says that it was unable to deliver in the last four 
hours, but it would keep trying.

What if it happened that you decided you did not want that e-mail message 
to get through anyway?  You changed your mind.  Can you stop Pine from 
trying to deliver the message?

Pine/2 on OS/2 supports POP3 perfectly.

Message-Id: <4qc5c3$5t1@quack.acs.umbc.edu>

I'm testing Pine 3.94 to upgrade the pine 3.91 our site uses.  I've
found that pine 3.94 generates .pine-debug files by default, which our
old 3.91 doesn't.  Is there any easy way to make it stop doing this
(with disable-default-in-bug-report?), or via modifying source code?

Yes there is, by modifying the source..
In directory pine/osdep are various os-???.h -files, modify the one your
system uses.

There should be line:
#define DEFAULT_DEBUG 2

Modify it to read
#define DEFAULT_DEBUG 0

and recompile with build ??? .

I use pine to read my news, and there is just one thing that I don't like
in it:

If I read a newsgroup, find an interesting message and I want to reply to
it, pine checks if the newsgroup is valid! Of course it is, I'm _just
reading_ it! And that check takes a LONG time with dialup-access.. Can
this be turned off easily? And how??

I know this isn't exactly the right place for this question, but I'm sure 
somebody here can answer it.

What is it called when the upper-ASCII characters in a message get 
converted into their hex values, preceeded by equal signs (=7F =AB =FF)?  
Does this type of encoding/escaping have an official name?  Are there any 
simple utilities that can decode this kind message?  Are there any Usenet 
newsgroups where I could ask questions about this type of encoding?

Thanks.

I've built 3.94 on HPUX 10.10 both ANSI and non-ANSI. In either
case when I try to send a text attachment that is greater than 
30KB (and perhaps less, I haven't found the limit yet) pine 
hangs during the send process and I eventuall have to kill -9.

Multiple smaller attachments work fine.

The busy indicator comes up but does not start.

Same thing happens with either background send on or not on.

Anyone have any ideas? I've sent this off to pine-bugs but I 
understand they are continually swamped.

Thanks,

Even without background sending, Pine hangs while chatting with sendmail,
which it [3.91] never used to do, especially on a large message.

Anyone else have this problem?  Even better, anyone have a solution.

Do you have a binary decoder that will work with windows 3.11. My 
office has taken it into its head to send data files containing word 
files and pictures etc. as binary files to protect them from possible 
pilfering. Company believes it will prevent possible eavesdropping. Do 
you have a decoder that I can obtain so that I can put these files back 
into English?

You can ignore those build messages.  They are unimportant.  They refer to
a demonstration program, called "ms", that you do not need.  It could not
build that demonstration program.

Just calling tset isn't sufficient. Instead, try one of the following
depending on the type of shell you are using:

# C-Shell

   setenv TERM vt220

# Bash or Korn shell

   export TERM=vt220

# Bourne shell (also works for Bash and Korn shell)

   TERM=vt220
   export TERM

This ought to fix the problem.

Hi everyone,

As a volunteer, I have been assigned to one task that I just don't know
how to accomplish. I would be much appreciative if someone could point me
to where I should look for if I want to disable Save/Export/Read/etc... to
any files beginning with a '.' (dot). Not being too much familiar with C,
I just can't see where, in the code, nor what to change. 

This would be with Pine3.91

Thanks in advance.

PS: Diff are good... :-)

Or, you can just go into Setup form the Main Menu, Config, scroll down to
the 'q' area and there are a series of 'quell...' commands.  Try checking
those until your messages go away.

My apologies for any confusion...

I was assuming the enquirer was asking about how to "view headers" and
hence was pointing them to the "enable-full-header-cmd" (which enables the
"H" command to do this).

I justify this assumption on the ground that: a)  this question is asked
far more frequently than "how do I alter the set of headers the viewer
displays by default"; and b) most people asking questions seem to assume
others are adept in mind-reading (as do I, I confess, from time to time) 
so a judicious application of Occam's Razor is often called for. :-)

If the original question was indeed "how do I alter the set of headers the
viewer displays by default" then the "viewer-hdrs" variable is indeed what
is needed (and, unfortunately, won't show up by doing a "W header").

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

	I've set my user profiles with an alias for pine as follows:

alias pine='pine -d0'

Okay here is your problem.  Pine is working perfectly.  The stuff on your
screen is not from pine.  Sounds like a unix system your on and some kind
of mail notification program is running.  The only mailnotification progrma
I know is called biff and it does exactly what you said yours is doing.
So, try dissabling it with the command "biff n" at your unix prompt.
This will only work for that login though.  You will need to make
modifications to your .login and such.  If any of this unix stuff gives you
trouble e-mail me and I will help, but I don't get most of the posts so
e-mail is best for reaching me.

By the way the pine notification is a little you have new mail from thing
tahat appears on the reverse text line below the reading window.  It
doesn't go over any of your message, but you should see this first hand
soon enough.  Good luck.

    The problem is with DOS code page 850.  That code page has all (or
nearly all) of the accented letters in the ISO-8859-1/Latin-1 character
set, BUT NOT IN THE SAME ORDER.  Therefore, if you type E9, you will
get what E9 corresponds to in code page 850, not what E9 corresponds to
in Latin-1.

    What you need is code page 819, which is a true Latin-1 character
set.  DOS code pages for all the ISO-8859-x character sets are
available from a university in Germany.  If you have a World Wide Web
browser, browse my home page (in my signature).  I have a link to that
site, from which you can get the appropriate DOS code pages with
documentation.  (If you do not have WWW access, send me an email, and
maybe we can work something out.)

    However, you say you are using Windows 3.11.  I use Windows very
little and am not an expert on it, but somehow I got the idea that
Windows uses ISO-8859-1 by default, rather than DOS code pages. 
However, I could be mistaken.  Anyway, code page 819 is a true DOS
Latin-1 character set.

   We are rolling out PINE 3.93 to our 200+ users on an IBM R30 using

   PC's running KERMIT etc).  All of them have been experiencing pine
   locking up at various times.  We seem to be seeing the problems
   mostly when going into the Compose mode from the main menu, or from
   the address book using the COMPOSE TO command.  The users sessions
   just freezes up.  Unfortunately, it is not consistent at all, one
   time it works, the next time it does not.

   Are there any known issues running PINE 3.93 on AIX 4.1.3 that we
   need to be aware of, (fixes per chance?)

You should upgrade.  Pine 3.94 fixed problems of this type that I had
been having under several of the 3.93.x alpha (beta?) releases.

Subject: multiple instances of PC Pine?
Date: Fri, 21 Jun 1996 14:31:07 -0400

I'd like to be able to run a couple instances of PC Pine for
Windows but I get this message: 

  Cannot start more than one copy of the 
  specified program.

Does anyone know of any tricks for getting Pine to run in more
than one Window?  I know about just having multiple telnet
sessions but I'd like to be able to take advantage of the PC Pine
features. 

Pine Developers: Do you have any plans to allow multiple
instances of Pine in the future? 

Thanks,
Nancy

I guess putting "h" in the initial-keystroke-list in Setup Config
would work.

I don't use that, but I have an "i" there to go directly to the INBOX
when I start pine.

On second thought the "h" command only works in the folder listing, so
you probably need my "i" as well (just put an extra "m" if you don't
like starting in INBOX):

initial-keystroke-list = ih

While you are on UNIX, why don't you use the `expand' command?

Dear Folks:

	Help!  I'm trying to find a friend who used a certain terminal at 
a certain time on our net.  Is there a way to get a name through Pine?  
(No access codes or anything private, just a list of those who used pine 
that day.)  Any hints?

					Sincerely
					Tracey

P.S.:  Please feel free to personally reply, since I don't come here that 
	often.

Mike,
I tried to type in a username to mail to that should be legal in our 
passwd file and it does not expand.
Do I need to make a change to the pine.conf?
Also have you heard that there are any problems with the default install 
of Pine from the Slackware distribution of Linux 1.2.13? If you can 
address a Linux question that specific I understand. 
I just need to know how to get an installable copy of Pine for Linux.
Thanks,

To stop pine from writing "dead.letter" when you cancel a message, select
the "quell-dead-letter-on-cancel" option in the configuration screen.

pine will still write a dead letter if pine dies for other reasons.

Hi,
how can one make Pine mark all messages in a newsgroup as read?
(similar to "catch up" in tin newsreader). Thanks,
                Pavel

My computer used to word wrap when I used Pico, and I must have changed something because now It won't word wrap, and I don't 
know what to do.  My Internet project is due tomorrow.  Any ideas?

Sorry to talk off-topic, but there are official newsgroups for discussing
spamming, both e-mail and USENET spams: news.admin.net-abuse.announce
(moderated?) and news.admin.net-abuse.misc.

Subject: Much gibberish in 3.94
Reply-To: barryg@plainfield.bypass.com
Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v2.32a)

Hello to the list!  Can anyone tell me why I suddenly get gibberish
now that my ISP has updated to Pine 3.94?  I am using Comit Lite
(DOS) which does not have VT100 emulation.  Does Pine need to have
VT100 emulation?  If so, I still get a lesser version of the problem
with my other communications program, Bitcom for Windows. 

What I get is bits and pieces of type all over the page, with no 
discernible pattern.  I may get my FreeNet logo at the bottom, and 
menu choices for Pine any and everywhere.  I have never had this 
properly explained to me.  The last time it happened was when I 
upgraded from a 14.4 tgo 28.8 modem.  Everything was working fine 
prior to installing the new modem, but after I installed it and tried 
to go into Pine, I got a severely disjointed display of  text all 
over the screen.  This time it happened after my ISP upgraded to Pine 
3.94.

Can anyone tell me why this happens?  I've heard explanations that 
range from modem initialization strings to incorrect terminal 
emulation.  Does anyone have the straight poop on this?

Thanks for any help!

    If Pine itself allows you to remap keys, I don't know about it. 
However, there are two possibilities: your terminal hardware may allow
you to remap what a particular keypress or key combination sends out;
or, if you are using communications software, that software way have a
remapping facility.

I'm running Pine 3.94 on Linux. inbox-path {my.domain/pop3}INBOX works at
startup, but then Pine seems to hang up the connection. It doesn't get
new messages, even though I've set the interval of getting new messages
to everythgin from 15 secons to 500 seconds. No luck.

Otherwise the new features (eg. mouse control in X) are nice, even though
that on little thing makes the program completely useless ;-)

As you are asking about compiling Pilot I assume this implies you have the
source code kit for Pine.

If so then try looking in the "doc" (documentation) subdirectory of the
place you unpacked the Pine kit to.  You'll find man pages in there for
Pine, Pileit, and some other things.

Cheers,

Hmmm... did you pull the binary version of Pine or compile it yourself? 
Are you just using a local password file (/etc/passwd) or are you using
NIS?  If the latter and you compiled Pine yourself did it link against any
additional libraries that support NIS passwd lookups? 

For example, on our SGI systems under IRIX 4 the default getpwXXX routines
in the standard C library only checked the local passwd file for entries,
and knew nothing about NIS.  Instead we had to explicitly link against the
-lsun library to get NIS support.  (Fortunately as of IRIX 5 this is now
the default).

> Do I need to make a change to the pine.conf?

Nope... in fact you have to set a configuration flag to *suppress* the
lookup (quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file).  (It might be worth checking
this hasn't accidentally got set!)

I'm afraid I know nothing at all about Linux in particular; we don't have
any boxes running it here.  Sorry!

[Gosh, I wish I had a pound (or even a dollar!:-) for every time this has
been asked and answered...]

0.  Go to Pine's Setup Configuration screen and make sure that the
"enable-aggregate-command-set" feature is enabled.

1.  Use aggregate commands to select messages/news articles to operate on.

2.  Apply a command to the selected set.

Steps 1 & 2 in more detail:

1a.  Go to Index screen and give the Select command by typing ";"
1b.  Use the menu that appears at the bottom of the screen to select a set
     of messages (eg "A" for All).

2a.  Apply a command to the selected set by giving the "A" (Apply)
     command.
2b.  Choose the command you want to apply from the menu (eg, "D" for
     Delete).

The pilot manpage (whatis - Database "whatis pilot") says:

It is really very simple - but enough tho view/edit multiple text-files in an

Hi, Pine developers/users!

I have mostly to deal with mailing lists; 90% of all replies in lists are
directed to list (with possible copies to author).

Here the problem: in case of reply I have to select between simple reply
(to the author i.e. From/Reply-To) or to the author and all recipients
(i.e. mailing list in this case). Thus if I want to reply to list (as
mentioned, 90% of all replies), I have to make "Reply to all recps". Here
the problem lies:

1. normally it is not necessary to make copy of reply to list until
excplicitly requested (at least, it seems to the right thing; correct me
if I am wrong). But I get the author inserted as primary recipient anyway.

2. the author is made the *first* recipient and thus Fcc is computed from
*his* address and not from *list* address. But it is natural to keep all
replies to list in the same folder as list itself.

In both cases it is possible to edit corresponding fields; but if yur are
forced to do it almost for *every* mail ...

So the feature: add something like "list reply"; that is reply not to
*author* but to the *recipient* of message. Of course, it should be
possible to include any additional recipients/author in reply in this
case.

really hope to see it in 3.95 ;-)

thanks in advance

Thanks for the advise. The command 'expand' does not exist on my SCO Unix
3.2v4.2 system (it was first introduced in 3.2v5.0, a.k.a. OpenServer 5),
but my version does support the command 'newform=B4, which can also be used
to do the job (thanks to Ravi Krishna for pointing this out).=20

I've been working heavily with Unix for some 10 years and never ran across
either command. Simply never required it. When a co-worker needed a tool
to convert tabs to spaces in a hurry I slapped together the forementioned
script. Glad to know there is a real solution to the problem. Unix can
do almost anything, as long as you're asking the right questions :-)

We now quickly return you to your regular program...

Regards,

- Richard.

Question if I may..  When will Pine 4 be out anyway? :>

Also..  What are the chances of PINE 4.0 having its own filtering 
features so that those under windows (I'm a linux user, but I look out 
for everyone <G>) or those that don't want to go through the procmail 
hassle can still enjoy the wonders of filtering? :>

I'm running pine 3.94 on SCO 3.2v4.1.  Most of the terminal have the
printer setup as "lp -dP6".  When you go into a message and print the
first time, everything's okay.  But if you try to print immediately again,
although the message prints, you never get back to pine.  You have to kill
the process to get control back.  You never see the second "PRINT Result"
message.

I've attached a rather lenthy pine debug file at level 9 and the output of
ps while pine is hung.

Thank you for any help you can give me.  I appriciate it!

Hi-

Does anyone have a script (unix) (or can point me to a location) which
converts a pine address book into a
elm addressbook (and/or vice versa). I see no sense in recreating the
wheel !

Thanks very much

Has anyone had any luck with compiling Pine on an Intergraph CLIX box? Also, I 
want it to use POP3.

Thanks

Subject: Pine icon/icon label in an XTerm
Date: 24 Jun 1996 17:13:19 +0100
Message-Id: <4qmeqv$2cg@jupiter.fcrd.gov.uk>


I'm running Pine 3.94 on a Sun SPARC system with SunOS 4.1.3. 

I have enabled enable-newmail-in-xterm-icon in the Pine setup.


Can anyone please help me, I have two questions:

1). I've noticed that Pine resets the Icon label to 'pine' in the
minimised XTerm. However, when I exit Pine, the label continues to say
'pine' rather than reverting back to 'xterm'. Is this a bug, or is there
some way of telling Pine to reset the icon label on exiting?? 

2). I've asked this before, but no-one responded: How can I change the
icon for pine? I have downloaded a .xbm file, but I don't know how to make
it the default icon.



Thanks in advance,

  Tim Porter.

I just noticed the 3M size difference between pine 3.91 and pine 3.94 
that I just compiled:  

lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     bin             8 Jun 24 14:45 pine -> pine.394*
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin        863492 Aug 22  1995 pine.391*
-rwxr-xr-x   2 root     bin       3968661 Jun 24 14:38 pine.394*

I guess this is ok, since I looked at the size of the binaries on your 
ftp server and it is about the same size.

-rwxrwxr-x  1 172      0         3925407 Jun 12 17:05 pine-bin.linux

I am just curious though, how much of a performance hit is this new 4M 
pine binary versus the older 865K binary?


Thanks,

Kenn Herman

Am I doing something wrong?
In any case it is very annoying.

If you are lucky, you can finger the user and obtain the
`Mail last reading' date from finger daemon.  Then you can
check this date with the date you sent the message.

If you want to get an automatic confirmation of the delivery of
the message in user's mailbox, you can try setting the header:
`Return-receipt-to: your_email_address'.

Subject: Using Pine 3.94 with PGP
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Well, I've recently built pine 3.94 and understand from my reading that
since pine 3.92, it has been possible to use pine with pgp as a mail
filter for smoothly handling encryption and decryption of email sent and
received.

I've read the help under the Setup-Config option:

sending-filters
display-filters

and it is of some assistance.  I also looked at the release notes of pine
3.94 for any mention of pgp (only once and offers little help).

So far I've tried setting /usr/local/bin/pgp -seat
as my sending filter, and when I use C-X to send, it does invoke PGP, asks
for my pass-phrase to sign the message, and asks for the recipient's user
id.  I've also put /usr/local/bin/pgp as my display filter.

What I've tried so far is sending myself mail encrypted with my public key
in the above manner, and when I receive the mail, the body is empty (and
it was not when I sent).   I would have guessed that the display filter
would do something smart like notice that this was encrypted, ask for the
pass-phrase of the secret key required to decrypt, but I get no such
thing.

Can anyone offer some hints or maybe a good document to read for how to
set up pine 3.94 with pgp to do the typical things?  Advice would be much
appreciated.

Thanks in advance

run strip on that new binary, it knocks it down to around 1.5MB or so.

Also - i fixed my 'no room to write file' error mesage i was
getting...Turns out the pine binary needs to be owned by bin, and I had it
owned root.

Large binary posts do not belong in unmoderated discussion groups.

I run a program that searchs for, and issues advisory cancels for,
large binaries in the akr, biz, comp, misc, news, rec, and sci
hierarchies.

I have issued 17 cancels for large binary files (average size 176,971
characters - total size 3,008,512 characters) posted to 14 different
unmoderated discussion groups in the comp, news, and rec hierarchies
(with cross-posts into into alt and ms-windows groups) as follows:
   8 rec.games.pbm
   2 rec.autos.marketplace
	rec.autos.rod-n-custom
	rec.aviation.homebuilt
	alt.autos.antique
   2 comp.os.ms-windows.apps.compatibility.win95
	comp.os.ms-windows.apps.utilities.win95
	comp.os.ms-windows.networking.win95
	comp.os.ms-windows.setup.win95
	comp.os
	ms-windows.win95.misc
   1 rec.travel.asia
   1 rec.arts.sf.starwars.misc
   1 news.newusers.questions
   1 comp.os.netware.misc
   1 comp.mail.pine

The cancels in non-targeted groups are a consequence of the way
cross-posts work.  A cross-posted article has only one Message-ID.
When it is canceled from one group it is canceled from all groups.

This pointer is being posted to each affected group listed above.
Follow-ups are directed to news.admin.net-abuse.misc.

If you want to see exactly which file was deleted from a particular
group, read the full report in news.admin.net-abuse.announce.  The
full report can also be found in alt.nocem.misc and alt.retromod.
Look for AR442 in the subject, or, if your reader supports it, use
this URL: news:ARMM-Report-442@redpoll.mrfs.oh.us

The criteria used to search for this batch of large binaries were:
   NEWSGROUPS: Unmoderated akr, biz, comp, misc, news, rec, or sci
	       (except for comp.binaries.apple2, comp.bugs.2bsd,
		and rec.games.bolo)
   BINARY: base64, binhex, uuencode, and xbtoa encoded files, etc.
   SIZE: > 100,000 characters [(size * (# of parts - .5)), if multi-part]

If you must post a binary to Usenet, please post it *only* to an
appropriate binaries newsgroup such as alt.binaries.misc, and do *not*
crosspost it to non-binaries groups.  Then, if you like, post something
in the appropriate discussion group telling people where to find the
binary in the binaries group (a pointer to the binary).  This will
permit news administrators and users to decide for themselves whether
to receive the binary files.

Please direct public feedback to news.admin.net-abuse.misc and private
feedback to red@redpoll.mrfs.oh.us.  Thanks.

Best wishes,
Dick

    Regulars on this group keep seeing the same questions turn up over
and over, sometimes, as Sven notes, just days apart.  I think there
needs to be a Pine FAQ separate from the University of Washington
folks, simply because these repetitive questions don't appear (easily,
at least) in the UW docs.  Anyway, I thought part of UW's idea was that
new users could fire up Pine and use it without docs.  Nevertheless,
these questions come up.  Hence the need for a *real* FAQ (not whatever
UW might call one of their hard-to-find docs).  (But for the record,
no, I am not myself now in a good position to write and maintain such an
FAQ.)

	Are you talking about uclink?  It doesn't turn off messages, 
messages is turned off by default so you have to put mesg y somewhere in 
.login or .cshrc as the defaults would override it if you put it in the 
wrong place...

My new deskjet 600 was printing fine from ProcomPlus for Win and PINE 
(3.91at trenton.edu), Don't know if it's a coincidence, but after I was 
in WP6 for Windows, in the Print Screen, under Select, I deleted two old 
printers. One was for my old old modem, the other for my 14.4 baud modem. 
(Now I have a 28.8 modem). Ever since, when I try to print from PINE I 
get a message :Application Error. PW2 caused a General Protection Fault 
in module HPFWIN02.DLL at 000B:3D3C. The computer freezes, and the phone 
goes dead. 

I can print fine from DOS, and WPWIN6.0 and Netscape. Did I maybe damage an 
INI file in Windows when I removed those 2 old printers?

This senior citizen has been using PINE about a year, and was 
enjoying it tremendously until this happenned.  Hope someone can help.

Hmm.

"There is no such thing with Pico.  At least the manual does not help.
 It only says something about 'option -w' which is neither intuitive
 nor foolproof."

"F".

Are you SURE that is the error message that you get?  You should get an
error such as "Bad LOGIN user name or password".

In any case, root, and any other uid 0 user, can not use IMAP.  This is by
deliberate design.  We do not intend to support root access to IMAP.  You
should have root mail forwarded to a non-uid0 user instead.

Greetings from Germany.  I have not been able to straighten out a problem 
and am hoping someone can give me a tip.  Please reply to my address (and 
not only to the list) since I also don't know how to recieve the list!

The problem is that my Inbox has "Read-Only" on the top status line.  
This means that there is only one message, actually a collection of all 
the messages of the past few weeks.  New messages just get added on to 
the end.  You have to scroll through the entire thing to get to new 
messages at the end.  Reply and Forward don't work because it tries to 
reply/send to the entire message at the local address.  It won't allow me 
to delete the message, and saving it also does not cause it to be removed 
from the Inbox.

I guess the main question is how to change the status line so it is no 
longer Read-Only.  I spent hours last night trying to find a command 
somewhere but no luck.  Please help me out if you know what I should do!  

Thanks so much,

Marc Osenberg, Koeln

I am sure just posting a regular (weekly, say) pointer to the FAQ at
http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/faq/ would help.
The problem now is that there is _nothing_ in the newsgroup itself.

Try looking at Pine's Setup Configuration screen (see that word "Setup" on
Pine's Main Menu? :-)

This screen lets you tailor Pine in many ways.  And each item has built-in
help (just put your cursor on the item and type the "Get Help" command
listed on the menu at the bottom of the screen).

To give you a toe-hold look on the first screenful at the top of the list
of features for something called "allow-talk".

Cheers,

Goto Setup->Config and select the feature "allow-talk".

1.  Start Pine
2.  At the Main Menu give the command "B" (Bug).

Can you set pine somewhere to always have full header command on 
when viewing received messages.

Is such a thing possible?

First, decide if you really want/need to compile it from the source code
(there are already compiled versions available for a number of platforms
available).

If you do...

1.  Obtain the source code distribution kit by anonymous ftp from
ftp.cac.washington.edu (directory /pine)

2.  Unpack the source code distribution kit (you'll need to uncompress it,
then un-tar it), and cd to that directory.

3.  Type the command "build XXX" where "XXX' is the codename for the
system type you are building Pine for.  A list of these can be found in
the file doc/pine-ports (the "build" command tells you this if you don't
give it a recognised value for "XXX").

4.  The compiled programs are placed in the bin subdirectory.

Cheers,

The same thing happens on SCO System 5, so I'd also appreciate a solution.

    That's all very nice, but it is quite parochial for the English-
speaking world to impose its 7-bit nonsense on the rest of the world
(and I say this as a native English-speaker).  I participate in a busy
mailing list concerning languages, and to be limited to 7-bit US-ASCII
without even European accented letters is absurd.

    With this particular mailing list I can see 8-bit characters with
no problem using Pine, although some readers report that they cannot. 
The list owner recently announced that the software at the site (in
Denmark) was soon going MIME-compliant and that participants should
make sure that their mail readers are MIME-compliant.  Fortunately Pine
is.

    It seems to be the "other guy" or some intermediate mail transports
that either mash on the MIME headers or cannot handle QP at all.  (I
have never even checked to see whether the mail from this list is
actually coming in QP and being automatically converted back to 8-bit
by Pine.)

You need to find out why your mailbox is not being recognized as a
mailbox, but instead is being treated as an ordinary file.  Most likely,
it is because there is some junk (possibly blank lines) before the first
characters, which should be "From ".

You are still running Pine 3.91.  If you upgrade to Pine 3.94, you may
find that it will recognize your mailbox, since 3.94 knows to discard
blank lines at the start of a mailbox.

Hi, I was wondering if it's possible on version 3.93 of Pine to sort
incoming mail as it comes in.  For example, if I get a message from
Joe@blow.com, the message will go to the "joe" folder.  Then if another
message comes in from Happy@time.com, that message will go to the "happy"
folder...  Thanks!

No... Pine (and all other mail reading programs) ar for reading mail AFTER
it has been delivered.

To intercept and redirect incoming mail you need to get in at the point at
which it is being delivered (which is nothing to do with Pine).

Some systems provide a utility such as "procmail" or "filter" to do this.
Try asking your local help desk if such software is available on your
computers and, if it is, how it is used.

Cheers,

It would seem that the entire range from SCO 3.2v4.1 through 3.2v5.0 is
affected. I've done a little debugging and noticed Pine is waiting for a
SIGCHLD in the function close_system_pipe() [pine/os.c]. This signal never
arrives for the second print command and thus we wait indefinitely. 

The reason why the second print commands ends in a <defunct> process / we
don't get a SIGCHLD is still unclear to me. I'll try to find out...

It sounds like you have a term program which has very broken
emulation.  Don't feel bad, most PC terms are pathetically broken.
(I think the only ones I've found which work to my satisfaction are
MS-Kermit and Crosstalk.)

You have a few solutions.  You could try to find a working comm
program.  Or you could play with your TERM variable.  Try setting TERM
to ansi, or maybe pcansi.  Depending on the system, there might be
term types set up for broken, brain-dead PC comm programs.  Ask your
local admin for help.

To change your TERM variable do

setenv TERM ansi

under csh, or 

TERM=ansi; export TERM

under sh derivatives.

Is this a new system or a new version?  If you origionally used pine and
are still using it then the message should still be there.  If you read it
in your inbox and then quit pine it should have been automatically moved
to your read message folder.  To find out which folder is your read
message folder (by default I believe it is mail) go to the configuration
screen, (at the main menu type S (setup) , C (config).  There should be
something called read message folder on the first page.  Look at what it
is type E (exit) go back to your folder list look in that folder for the
message.  If that is not the problem then I can't help you.

Thank you for your answer.

It is a bit hard to define. However I think I can divide it into two
subproblems:

1) pine sometimes forgets to remove the "N" mark _after_ I read the
message, and only pressing D and then U, removes the "N" mark. 

2) When I go thru my mails in my mailbox I sometimes find that some
messages marked as new I already have read, and they did not have the "N"
sometime before.
	reason for this problem might be because of 3 things:
	- I have added some "fix" to the code which add the "+" when
          I"m mentioned in cc, that is pine3.93/contrib/flag.cc
          (I think I added it in 3 places)
        - size of my mailbox, it can range to 2'000 messages, and I'm 
          getting on average 175 messages per day.
        - it had been exited inproperly few times (kill, power
          interruption, etc), but I don't think this one is case.

Here's a technique that I just started using to read news with
pine.  When I first go into the group I type

  ;aad

which marks everything deleted.  Then I read the articles that
I'm interested in and if there is an article that I want to
not delete (e.g., if I want to respond to it later), I type

  u

which marks it undeleted.  When I'm ready to leave the group
I type

  x

which excludes all the messages marked for deletion.

Does anyone have any other tips for news reading with pine?

Thanks,
Nancy

HELP!!!

I am having a problem with pine 3.91!!!  It was working fine until I 
instituted virtual email and Sendmail 8.7.5.  Pine will allow me to read 
my email and I can try to reply to a message....but....when I tell Pine 
to send the message, it says that it is sending and storing a copy of the 
message in the sent-mail folder, but the message is never sent!!  I can 
use Netscape or some other mail program to send and receive mail and it 
works fine, just not pine....what could have changed?  I have several 
users that have shell accounts that are starting to get annoyed that they 
cannot send or reply to email, but they can receive mail...

Someone please H E L P!!

Thanks in advance,

Jim Williams

Pine added a filtering features since version 3.92.  It allows users 
to pipe the email through a "filter", which can be a PGP encryption/
decryption/clear-sign scheme.  PGP has this kind of usage in mind 
when it was developed with a "-f" feature, I guess.

Any way, if you have Pine 3.92 or newer version (I have see 3.94), you 
can visit my web page to see detailed instructions for configuring it
to use PGP filters in an easy-to-use fashion (not sure if it can be 
called seamless).  The URL is

	http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html

I did this under Irix 5.3.  I think most Unix machines can do the same, 
but I have not tested on any other machines.  PGP 2.62 is used.  Other 
versions should be OK, too.

Cheers!

This is a (undocumented) FAQ and it pops up very often in this group.

I have a web page that describes a procedure to configure Pine to use
PGP for encrypt/decrypt/clear-sign.  The URL is 

	http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html

Please take time to visit and comment.

You might have read the followup by R. Rosenfeld.  My approach is much 
simpler than his.  No Perl.  Just Pine, PGP, and csh or ksh.

Hello,

I bounced this question off my local postmaster and system admin, but he

Subject: using user dictionaries with pine


Hi,

I've noticed that pine appears to use the unix 'spell' program to check
spelling.  Perusing the man pages for spell, I saw that using a user
supplied dictionary in addition to the standard one is easily done on the
command line. I would like to be able to do this within pine, but so far
my attempts at setting up my .pinerc file to do so have failed.  Is there
a way to get pine to include my user supplied dictionary with the standard
one when checking the spelling of an outgoing email message?  from
within my .pinerc file I've tried

speller=spell +.dictionary
speller='spell +.dictionary'
speller="spell +.dictionary"

The last one almost works, but pine ignores the list of unrecognized words
which is returned.

Cheers,
Steve.

Could you compare the date formats from the messages send by Inge with
those send by you?  Most likely the message from Inge have an unknown
timezone or contain other information that cannot be parsed.

There is room for improvement in the code that does the date handling, but
it is already quite complex.  Currently, a date having a symbolic time
zone of over 3 characters causes that date to be ignored by the parser.

Apparently some timezones, as set by certain operating systems (within
Europe?), have been "upgraded" to 6 character symbolic names. I know that
on my SCO OpenServer 5 system the default timezone is now set to METDST,
which also throws my date sorting out the window. It looks like a problem
that could be fixed in a future release of Pine. 

Hope this information helps (if just a little).

Regards,

- Richard.

Thanks for your reply -
indeed their are differences in the headers:

  Date: 6  Jun 96 13:50 GMT
  From: Inge-M.Nielsen@53677251.da.diatel.dk
  To: onielsen@QUACK.CIMS.NYU.EDU
  Subject: Vedr.: 'Hilsen fra Connecticut' 3

  Date: Thu, 25 Jan 1996 19:50:53 +0100 (MET)
  From: "Ole M. Nielsen" <uniomni@unidhp1.uni-c.dk>
  To: "Inge M. Nielsen" <"Inge M..Nielsen"@53677251.da.diatel.dk>
  Subject: Hejsa

I have also now verified your inormation that mails with TZ = METDST are
treated differently.

BUT -
How can pine display the correct date in the date field of the index
regardless of these messy headers ?

It seems to me that somewhere in the pine-code there is a working
algorithm for extracting the date even though the headers are different.
Maybe the sorting could be done based on this information instead of doing
the parsing all over.

This is at least how it looks from a users point of view.

Best regards
Ole Moller Nielsen

This happens in Pine 3.94 if you have the
enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation feature selected, but the negotiation
fails.  This will be fixed in Pine 3.95...

Never.  Development of the IMSP protocol has ended in favor of a
simpler, and more general, protocol called ACAP (Application
Configuration Access Protocol).  Assuming the work on ACAP progresses
suitably, ACAP support will be provided in Pine 4.something.

We are hoping to have Pine 3.95 ready RSN, but I don't recall seeing
any reports of this problem before.  Could you elaborate on exactly
what problem you are seeing?

You still need to configure Pine to include the file.  At the main 
screen, select "Configure or update Pine."  Scroll down to "attach 
signature at bottom," and toggle.

Hi, all!

If I post news, the Fcc is set to name of news group. Is it possible to
prevent it? I would prefer to have no Fcc; if I really need a copy (very
rare case) then I can set it manually.

It was possible in some earlier version of Pine. There Fcc for news was
computed as default-fcc; setting default-fcc to "" prevented any copy.

Probably some configuration parameter in 3.95?

Please, *don't* answer "you can manually delete Fcc field"; I am more or
less aware about it ;-)

thanks in advance

Hi

I'm using 3.94 within an xterm session on SunOS 4.1.3_U1 and I
occasionally get a premature exit. The error message is swift (soemthing
or other detected) and I can't catch it all or deliberately reproduce it.
It seems to occur when moving up a list of messages.  I can't see anything
in pine-debug to casue alarm, any theories?

I couldn't find a way to turn it off, except with the command line option
below.

>From the Pine man page:

      -d debug-level      Output diagnostic info at debug-level (0-9) to the

Is there a way to insert a left-hand margin when a message is down-

Option #1 of the printer options begins to print in the first column. 
I tried the following command as Option #3 w/o success: pr -o 5 | vtprint
Help will appreciated.

Message-Id: <4qe6gj$4ob@chaos.kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be>

Hello,

When I use Pine 3.94 (or Pico) on Windows 3.11 with code page 850
and in pinerc character-set=ISO-8859-1 there are problems with
accented characters.  E.g. if I type small e acute accent on my
keyboard (= E9 in ISO-8859-1), then I get upper case U acute accent
which is E9 in CP850.

Do I need to work with ISO_TO_CP and CP_TO_ISO environment variables 
and corresponding files (does that work) ?
If so, has someone already composed them.

Thanks in advance,

-Herman-

we are working with the pine tool on DEC Alpha workstations
(DUnix Version 3.2) .
It works very well, but during the last time we have some problems.
Therefore I send a mail to pine-faq@cac.washington.edu  to get the FAQ
list, but I can't read the mail.

Following message appears on the screen :
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: Verbose Send Option For Pine

One of our users recently asked me if Pine has
 
"a switch that let's you see the interactions between the sending 
and receiving host to ensure that the message has been sent and
that the recipient has an id on the receiving host - a verbose send?"

I checked the Pine FAQ and the list archives and there didn't seem to
be any discussion of this.  Is there such an option for Pine?

Hi, 
Is it possible to edit the folder list screen, through a config or something.
On my terminal it leaves loads of blank lines in the middle of the lists and
headers...

3.94 does:
            [ ]  enable-verbose-smtp-posting
It adds another option when sending to do it "verbosely"....

Kinda interesting, probably helpful in debugging.... but otherwise not
much of anything.

Many mail readers in other settings (such as QWK readers in the BBS
world) have the capability of being set to ignore messages from folks
you don't like, or on subjects you don't like.

I find it difficult to believe that a program that is capable of reading
and deleting messages can't be modified to do so automagically based on
rules.

The code to do so isn't difficult; integrating it with the existing code
is more difficult, but probably not much more.

	The model that pine follows is that the filter process should
be done a delivery time.  This way the messages you won't want to
see at all will not be placed in your mailbox.  If it is done by
the UA (pine) it must travel from your mailbox to the UA.  In the
case of a UA which is running on a PC with access to the mailbox
over a modem connection this can undesirable.

	So, you are right, pine could do it if they added the code.
However, the current model was choosen as having more benifits.

I don't mean to imply that the Pine development team doesn't have good
and sufficient reasons to follow the model they do; I was merely
addressing the other fellow's assertion that it couldn't be done.

Thanks for the extra info.

What I was referring to was (if memory serves) the original question about
*redirecting* incoming messages into separate folders.  For example,
Pine-Info mailing list messages are placed into a "pine-info" folder ready
for reading rather than be ing left in the INBOX along with everything
else.

(If I misread the original question, my apologies!)

Your description is for a "kill-file" like behaviour for reading messages
in a folder AFTER delivery (which is quite different from redirecting
arriving messages into folders other than the INBOX).

Pine does indeed provide commands to do this (Select, Apply and Zoom), but
admittedly can't be set up to *automatically* perform a sequence of these
when a folder is opened.  (Probably a good thing, otherwise the hidden
messages would probably be left sitting there ad infinitum:-)

Cheers,

What would be neat is if it could automagically delete them.  Of course,
this is code that would need extensive debugging before it went out the
door.  :-)

We are in the process of revising the Pine FAQs, and also adding a
keyword-searchable full-text index of all the documents in the Pine
Information Center (http://www.washington.edu/pine/).  This searchable
index will be independent of, and in addition to, the two (one full-text,
one subject-lines-only) for the Pine Discussion Forum archives at
http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/.  After that is implemented, a
periodic, but brief posting -- as opposed to a lengthy one with many
questions and their answers -- will go out to the Pine newsgroup/mailing
list about where and how to find answers to questions about, or related to,
Pine.  

However, no matter how extensive or accessible software documentation is
(which is not to claim that Pine's is perfect in either ;-), there
will probably always be users who prefer to ask a question to seeking an
existing answer.  A problem with the idea of the FAQ as a "shield" against
repetitive questions is that that requires the questioner to:
a) assume that his/her question has been ("frequently") asked before;
b) assume that the answer has therefore been given and archived somewhere;
c) find the location of that archive;
d) find the question, perhaps quite differently phrased, in that archive.

This is not to say that FAQs are not useful ... but more as an ad hoc
collection of wisdom that hasn't found its way into, or has no real place
in, any "formal" documentation, than as a way of deflecting repeated
questions.

Has anyone else experienced this strange file showing up when exiting Pine v3.94
called 'gmon.out'?!? A solution to this buggy would be apreciated! I sent a mail to
the pine-bug-report address, but I doubt that there will come any reply in the
nearest future...
I am running Pine on a Linux machine (kernel build 2.0)

On that same note what is the specification or where could I find the 
specification for how the /usr/local/lib/ directory file should be formatted?
I have seen it work name 2 tabs address. Is this the correct specification.

I discovered quite by accident some very convenient keystroke
  shortcuts in pine 3.92 which I then tried and failed to find
  in the online documentation, so I thought I'd share them.

  After selecting the Save command in the index of some folder, you
  can change the folder collection by using the up and down arrow
  keys. I used to have to use ^T and navigate around the folder list,
  and then I couldn't create a new folder. Handy

  Also in the index, doing a Shift-; selects the current message and
  moves to the next one. Much easier than select, return, next.

Here's a feature I think would be of wonderful benefit in Pine: keystroke
macros.  Basically, the same thing as the initial-keystroke string that
can be given with -i or in pine setup (so, the code's already there for
implementing that part), but have a particular string associated with a
key sequence, maybe a function key, or even just a particular
command - eg "macro <macroname>" - where 'macro' would me some
currently-unused key sequence (say, '@' "#" or 'k' for <k>eystroke macro). 
Same UI as file save & such - ^T could bring up a list of macros, etc.

Having macros in pine would allow built-in mail filtering...Pine already
has excellent selection capabilities; but it gets tiring to constantly hit
';,t,t,i,m,a,p,CR,a,s,i,m,a,p,-,l,i,s,t,CR' just to save (for instance) my
imap list email (not to mention the extra keys for grabbing the Cc:'d imap
mail).  Sure, there's procmail and filter, but I don't want to have to
process my mail with more than one program - I *like* Pine's handling of
things, and besides, my mail server is a dedicated IMAP/POP server.  I
want to leave unread messages there until I'm ready for them...so
downloading via popclient and then running procmail won't work for me. 
Now, give me a procmail that does IMAP and I'll be happy.  Or Pine
macros... 

Anyway, there are no doubt many other uses for something like macros
besides filtering that I haven't thought of - but that's what I'd want 'em
for. 

Oh, another nice thing to have would be a text-selection field of "To and
CC" or perhaps "all headers" (ie not including the message body).

You could add these items to the "customized hdrs" in the setup_config
menu.  In addition, you need to do a "^R" when you start composing the
message to display all the header lines since you may need to add info
such as recipient addresses.

Try a few times and you can master it very soon.   

Cheers!

In the main menu there should be a command within the command menu at the
bottom that says B Report Bug.  Basicly you should just beable to type a B
at the main menu and automatically report a bug.

Try to uncomment the following line in pine/osdep/os-sco.h :

/* #define SYSV_SIGNALS    /* use System-V signal semantics (ttyin.c) */

Enabling System-V signal semantics turned out to solve this problem on my
SCO 3.2v4.2 and 3.2v5.0 systems. A BIG thank you to Michael Seibel from
the Pine Team for pointing me to the possible cause and its solution!

Kind regards,

How do I untar pine (or any file)? (I am not a very smart computer person)
and how do I uncompress pine?

I just upgraded unix system pine from 3.91 to 3.94 (oooh, nice features).
Should I also upgrade the /usr/local/pine.conf system defaults file ?

Does anyone know how I can mark messages in a useNet newsgroup (Yes, I
know about using the ":" key) and then forward those messages to an email
address elsewhere.

Specifically, I want to "G"o to comp.this.and.that.etc, then I want to
mark the 17 messages which look like they might be interesting, then I
want to press a magic keystroke sequence which sends them all to that
email address at once, and not have to do each one by hand.

I've got a telnet connection to a shell account, and that should explain
why I want to do all that gugla-dugla.

Thanks for any info.

Hi, all!

The WhereIs command in index screen searches only the screen output. If
Subject line is too long to fit on the screen, the rest isn't touched.

Is there simple way to search in *whole* subject line without using Aplly
command?

thanks in advance

What OS?  It looks like Solaris 2.x.  It is generally harmless.  The
sysadmin has installed a version that was linked on a more recent version of
Solaris than the one it is running on.  Have the sysadmin link it on the
oldest version of Solaris 2.x available, or have her make a link between
/usr/lib/libc.so.1.8 and /usr/lib/libc.so.1.9 to fool the loader.

This might cause some problems.  There are subtle changes in some of the
kernel stuff and networking stuff as you go from release to release.  I
believe I just did a symlink from libc.so.1.8 libc.so.1.9 when I was
managing old SunOS.  I have also done this with the runtime compatibility
libs on Solaris 2.x.

Generally LD_LIBRARY_PATH should be avoided if possible.

: Users are on a variety of Wyse 150, IBM 3151 terminals, and PC's.  PINE
: seems to lock up completely, then when we kill the users process, the

Try adding this to your /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed:

feature-list= disable-keyboard-lock-cmd,
	      preserve-start-stop-characters,
	      assume-slow-link

I too had problems with serial line terminals.  The problems seemed to be
that Pine and Pico were absorbing XON/XOFF characters, and not obeying 
them.  Adding these options help tremendously.

FWIW,

Personally I'm not terribly fussed over having macros (thelongest I type
is "; S N $ O ^W ^Y" which is manageable)

HOWEVER, having a text selection option of "To: & Cc:" would indeed indeed
be excellent...

I have given up trying to select and zoom onto messages from a particular
mailing list because it is just to long to do the double selection needed
to search first the "To:" field and then the "Cc:" field.

Cheers,

It certainly would!  (It's quite different for kill-files for Usenet News
because there the offending articles are merely "hidden" rather than
permanently deleted, so it is possible for you to "get them back" if need
be.)

Personally I think extending this to a feature within a mail reader would
be putting a worryingly powerful facility into the hands of potentially
naive users.  I think sticking with a delivery filter such as procmail to
redirect/return/trash messages may be better, as these tend to be only
used by the more advanced user.

The age-old question gets the age-old response... :-)

0.  Go to the Setup Configuration screen ("S" then "C" at Pine's Main
    Menu).  Make sure the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature is
    selected.

1.  This then gives you some extra commands to use in the Index screens
    (both e-mail and Usenet News): Select (;), Apply (A) and Zoom (Z).
    In the Index select the messages you want to operate on by either
    using the ":" command to select the individually, or the ";" command
    to select them in batches if they share a common attribute (eg,
    sender, date, subject string)

2.  Give the Apply (A) command to apply a command to the entire set of
    selected messages.  This will take you to a menu of the commands you
    can apply: you want "F" (Forward).

Cheers,

  One other thought--maybe you will have to decode it.  What kind of
extension did you get when it ended up in your directory??

Greetings: I have just installed netscape 2.01 and tried using its new 
email function. Whenever I try to access my POP server from the pine 
distribution system I get the UIDL error message. Can anyone tell me what 
I need to do to get UIDL?

Thanks

This was with pine 3.93. It crashed most of the time when trying to
insert a big text file with ^R, not necessarily a uuencoded one. 

I got an email replay today saying this was fixed in 3.94, so don't
bother about it.

I am trying to get the syntax right for doing remote access such that:

pine does not attempt to do an rsh to the host to start /etc/rimapd,
with a predefined mail box.  I've got it working the other way, but
the rsh is bad news for later on. Suggestions on setting the

The POP server included with the standard Pine distribution does not
include the UIDL command.

Instead download the separate IMAP 4 server, which does.

Ben,

I believe there is no way for this to occur.  "rsh" uses the current uid
by default, which means /etc/rimapd will fetch the "inbox" for that user.
Putting an entry in /etc/services and /etc/ientd.conf for imapd at port
143 will allow you to not have to do the rsh to /etc/rimapd.  Then you can
remove /etc/rimapd to force using port 143.  This will force pine to
prompt you for a username and passwd.  Will this suffice?  The only other
thing I can think of would be to do something like:

incoming-folers=Mailbox1 {host.name}/path/to/mail1,
Mailbox2 {host.name}/path/to/mail2, etc

in your .pinerc file (assuming you have "enable-incoming-folders" set.
This should give you an incoming folder collection with:

INBOX	Mailbox1	Mailbox2	etc...

as selection choices.  INBOX will open the folder specified by the
"inbox-path=" value inyour .pinerc file and the others should try to open
the files specified above.  If /etc/rimapd is there, and your .rhosts file
is setup for no passwd access, _and_ you have rw access to the files
specified, you should be able to open them without entering a username and
passwd.  If these are not alternate "inboxes" then you can just include
them in the list of folder-collections in .pinerc and that works fine.

I have a .pinerc file setup to give me a choice of three different
"inboxes" (on three different systems).  I also have three different
folder-collections setup.  The first is the default for saving, but I can
save to the others by specifying which collection, a la:

folder to save to [saved-messages]:{work.machine}mail/project

etc.


I hope this helps.  If you get this working, please let me know what you
did.  I don't have time to play around with this stuff right now, but I'm
interested in doing it at some point.

Thanks

Not true (if I understand the question correctly)...

The usual sequence of events when opening a mail folder is:

1.  Pine tries "rsh"  to connect to the specified host end execute
    "/etc/rimapd".

2.  If this fails (eg, no permission to use rsh, /etc/rimapd not there,
    etc) Pine falls back to connecting to port 143 and then prompts for a
    username and password to be entered.

Step 1 *can* be bypassed by including the port number explicitly in the
host definition (by appending the host name with ":143") in your
configuration file (typically accessed through Pine's Setup Configuration
screen).

For example,

	{imap.myhost.mydomain:143}inbox

or whatever folder it is you are defining.

This is very useful for sites who haven't set up the /etc/rimapd link and
rsh to allow direct access (without having to type in a username and
password again) to their mail via Pine and IMAP.

[Disclaimer: the above certainly worked up to and including Pine 3.91.  I
hereby admit I haven't tried it with later versions, but would be
surprised if the behaviour was different.]

Cheers,

... or use Netscape 3.0 beta 4, which does not need UIDL command :-)

Hint:  Do not use 8bit characters.  Then there will be no need for QP.

Subject: Win95 Pine 3.94 no longer able to send
Date: 26 Jun 1996 22:35:06 GMT
Message-Id: <4qsduq$4va@ss.netgate.net>

Not long ago, I had Pine 3.94 running beautifully on my Win95 box.  Now,
when I attempt to send a message, I receive the tremendously helpful error:

   [Error sending: ]

I have verified and reverified that the SMTP host is receptive and
responsive, and this did work recently, so I am quite puzzled.  Is it
possible that test runs of other mail clients (Simeon, Embla, Roam) on the
same Win 95 box have whacked a local file that Pine needed for sending?
Please find enclosed the debug file.

Thanks,

    Hmmm.  You say you are using one of the Windows Pine versions
(pcp_w16.zip or pcp_w32.zip), but somehow you are using IBM Code Page 850,
which is a PC code page that does not see much use under Windoze?

    The usual code page which sees use in western European Windows is
1252, which is identical to ISO 8859-1 in those positions where ISO 8859-1
includes printing characters.  But if you are truly using CP850, but
labelling it in your configuration as iso-8859-1 then read on...

    Well, yes, to do what you are wanting.  While DOS versions of PC-Pine
would gladly make use of these variables to perform translation from the
preferred over-the-wire MIME charsets to the DOS code pages (and in fact,
had code internally to perform the translation between the most common
charsets and code pages), the Windows version did not consult any
translation tables, until the most recent release (3.94) -- although I
have not personally verified that this release does indeed perform
properly with Windows translation tables.

    The reason why the Windows Pine never bothered with translation is
because CP1252 was close enough to ISO 8859-1.  Unfortunately, at least
one of the other Windoze code pages is sufficiently different from the
corresponding subset of ISO 8859 that it cannot be used with accented
characters.

    If you look in the Pine source code, you will see the tables which are
used internally for translation between the preferred MIME charsets and
the DOS code pages, which can be found in pine3.94/pine/osdep/codepage.dos
(a new location in 3.94), and you can steal from these to create the
environment tables.  Note that the format in the source code is slightly
different from what I have in the files here which are read for the
environment variables, and the desired format is documented in the tech
notes (or somewhere), so it's a simple matter of a quick conversion (I
think stripping out the commas will do it for you, but check to be sure). 

    The easiest thing, of course, under Windows, is to use CP1252, but you
should be able to use the ISO_TO_CP and vicey-versus with the latest Pine,
as users of Central European Windows and Pine will want to do to convert
CP1250 to the MIME charset ISO 8859-2 so that at last all characters will
be correct.  (I've been way overworked to be able to configure this
myself, sorry...)

Nah. The problem is that deliver, the one that actually gets mails to a
user, runs suid root, so quotas won't do you any good here. Just look in
the sendmail.cf file, add an option to sendmail so it uses a system
delivery file other than the standard (look in the manual, I forgot the
option). When you do this, for security reasons, deliver drops its
privileges...and you are all set. As for the system delivery file...if
you don't wanna do anything fancy, just echo the users that should
receive the mail, which are given as parameters in the command line.
Look it up in the deliver man page, it's all there..

On a VMS system (5.5-2) running pine 3.89, I have a large number of messages.
I'd like to copy these to a PC running the current version of pine (3.94, I
believe). That is, I'd like to have the messages accessible as if they had
been received on the PC originally.

Is there any easy way to do this?

Is it possible to configure this somehow, or work around it?

If you are using 3.93 or 3.94, there is a configurable switch,
"allow-talk".  Just flip this to on, and that will allow talk
requests through.

Go to the index of the newsgroup you want then:

** Select them all: ;a

** Delete all selected messages: ad

** Expunge: x

That's all.

Subject: Reading Pine mail folders offline in DOS
Date: 22 Jun 1996 23:05:38 GMT
Message-Id: <4qhu82$kot@nw101.infi.net>

I use Pine from a Unix shell account and have burgeoning mail folders that
I'd like to take offline.  I can read the mail folders offline with a
DOS-based program like list, but I would prefer to be able to view the
email subject/date index and choose which email to reread.  With a typical
DOS-based text viewer the mail folder is one big blob of text.
I tried installing PC-PINE on my computer at home, but it won't start up
saying there isn't a PCTCP module present.  Obviously it wants to go online
or at least have that capability.  Is there some way to start up PC-PINE
without having my Winsock start up also?  Also, this is one big program for
what little I want it to do.  Is there some sort of utility for DOS or
Windows that will index/sort/view PINE mail folders offline?
Thanks for any and all help.

The support team answered to a bug report I sent,
telling me that pine does not always understand 
the Date Field. These messages are then grouped at the
beginning of the index.
Perhaps the date header is not
normalized enough too.

Not necessarily for any specific version, but I am using 3.94.  Is there
any way to change the format with which pine quotes messages and articles,
rather than the bland "On <date>, <name> wrote:" ?  If not now, is
there any work on that, or is it just unimportant?

Hi Terry,

	Related question. My site is using PINE 3.91 and has the
Folder-Collection line configured to /Mail instead of /Work, and they have
that value fixed, but not the value to save postponed-msg folder, which I
added to the name of the file. Anyway, I was able to save the postponed-msg
folder to my /work directory, where I could upload and download the folder
to and NO Problem there. I can then edit the file on my home computer and
upload the file. The problem occurs after uploading the file, that PINE
doesn't recognize multiple messages within the Postponed-Msg Folder, after
I saved the changes. I never changed the header information, just the body
of the message and when I attempted to load the postponed-msg folder, it
didn't give me a choice of messages, but loaded the entire file as one
message.
	
	When PINE includes the ability to postpone messages, so users can
reply offline to interesting messages, tell the programmers to allow for
users to save messages in another editor, like Qedit or Word, without the
user reformatting the message. I can download the file from the server.
Delete the file on the server. Upload the file to the server and not
editing the file, PINE reads the multiple messages.

	What can I do to have PINE read the edited file, correctly?

Message-Id: <4qs8fc$32d1@marcus.its.rpi.edu>

My school (as many do) does not allow CGI access, so I've just had my 
forms mail the responses to me, and I just sort through the gobbledygook 
myself.  However, something must have changed, because I used to just be 
able to read the response right in pine, and now what I see is 
  
[Part 1, Application/X-WWW-FORM-URLENCODED  86bytes]
  [Can not display this part. Use the "V" command to save in a file]

When I do that, it's just a simple text file as before.  Is there anyway 
to get pine to just display it, like it used to?  I haven't changed 
versions of pine, I'm sure it's just that some server software got 
upgraded or something like that.

Thanks,
Tony

Thanks for the info here, I was having the same problem compiling
pine3.94 on my brand new linux box. I installed the latest version of 
slackware from ftp.cc.gatech.edu last week, and this is the first
package I've tried to compile since then.

It turns out the "iovec" is defined in <sys/uio.h> AND in
<linux/uio.h> on my machine. As a matter of fact, there is a comment
in <linux/uio.h> that says you ought to remove the other definition.

So.. I just commented it out of <sys/uio.h> and #included
<linux/uio.h> within <sys/uio.h> (since it needs "struct iovec" later
on). 

Now, I'm not an expert in Linux, so I'm not sure if what I did is
smart or safe, but it works and now I'm using Pine 3.94 !

	Hi there and I hope that you can help me. I actually lost all my
mails in the INBOX because I was in the 'elm' command and I typed yes for
all the messages to be saved in my 'received mails' folder. Can I retrieve
all my messages and save or put it back to my INBOX in PINE? And also can
you tell me how to save all of my mails to a disk. 

	Thanks and I really hope that you can help me. Bye.

I'd like to use Pine to read both my inbox on my home Linux box, and the
inbox on our server at work.  The server is running IMAPD, and I can
access every folder in my collection over there.  However, when I try to
add a folder for {mail.chickasaw.com}INBOX, it tells me it can't add
that folder because it already exists.  I'm using 3.94.  What's the
deal?

Yes, I strongly support this.

Probably, a configuration parameter, which will list the MIME types to be
treated the same as TEXT.

The actual problem is, how such message should be terated when being
answered. Should the original type be retained, or converted to
TEXT/PLAIN? I am in favor of later.

Clint,

>From the message index, use the ';' (semicolon) command to mark all
messages you want to forward. This allows you to specify the messages by
number. Then, press a (apply operation to all marked messages) and f
(forward). This brings up the question 'forward as mime digest?' Press y
to include the forwarded messages as attachments, or n to include them as
plain text. Then, pine takes you to the message composer where you enter
the forward address, and select ctrl-X (send). If you want, you may return
to the index and press ; (select) a (unselect all) to remove the selection
marks.

    This can indeed be the case.  If you read a message, and Pine crashes
(or in my case, my IMAP connection goes down) before Pine has had the
chance to checkpoint the mail folder, none of the status changes since the
last checkpoint will be recorded.  This means recently-read messages do
not get marked as read, and will reappear as new at next folder access.

    I have had the experience of a very large number of messages in my
(Cyrus) IMAP folders, which had been marked as read (not new) for several
weeks, all become marked as new.  This has almost always been associated
with crashes of the server, when our machines forget what time it is, and
I was assuming that the access times of these files compared with the
system's idea of the present time is responsible for this (mostly because
I didn't want to look any deeper to try and find out what really happens
there).  I am assuming in this case that the problem I see is not a Pine
problem, but a Cyrus/machine fault.


    Hope this bit of information is useful...

Message-Id: <4qskn2$842@doc.zippo.com>

I'm trying to set up a 'mail gateway' scheme, and so far all outgoing mail 
works fine.  The only way for me to get incoming mail is to use a popclient 
for each user, which moves all mail downstream to the client machine.

However, I would like to manage these mailboxes remotely on the gateway 
machine.  I set up pine on the client to access the remote machine via IMAP, 
but the error I get says "Can't connect to ideatest1.idea.com,143: Connection 
refused".  I read in this newsgroup that is because the gateway does not have 
the IMAP daemon running.

How do I do this???  The imapd manpage says it must be linked to /etc/rimapd, 
which doesn't exist!

Seems like a number of us are having hgelp printing email from pine. I
have to highlight it, one screen at a time and transfer it to a file
(usually A:) in from 2 to 10 chunks, then import into Word or Notepad to
print. Is there any way to highlight an entire message in one sweep so I
do not have to do incrementals? Thanks a million. The answer will probably
help a couple of other recent posters. Ciao

As of version 3.92 Pine supports "mailcap" files.  These tell programs ho
wo to display (compose, etc) items of a given MIME type.  You could set up
an entry in your systemwide or personal mailcap file for
"Application/X-WWW-FORM-URLENCODED" to invoke a pager or editor to view
the item (it'll be a separate program rather than inside Pine itself).

Even better would be to use a program that decodes the WWW-FORM-ENCODING
and displays it in some mre meaningful way.

The hooks _are_ there; you just need to do a bit of research and fiddling
to get it working as you wish (but that's what using computers is all
about:-)

You're almost there, but heading along the road in the wrong direction...

First of all forget about /etc/rimapd ... I'll come to that later.

So... to access you e-mail via IMAP you must first set up an IMAP server
by installing the imapd server software.  The general steps to do this
are:

1.  Put the imapd executable somewhere convenient (eg, /etc, /usr/etc,
    /usr/local/etc, or wherever) and make sure it has execute access to
    everyone.

2.  Configure your inetd so that connection requests arriving on port 143
    fire up the imapd executable.  (ie, edit your inetd.conf file and get
    inetd to reread the config file -- typically by sending it a HUP
    signal if I recall correctly).

3.  As a convenience add "imap" as a name mapping to port 143 in your
    /etc/services file.  (Probably should be done before HUP-ing inetd ...
    I forget.)

Now test your imapd is working properly by using telnet to connect to port
143 of that machine.  For example:

	telnet imap.myhost.mydomain 143

You _should_ get a welcome banner appearing from the IMAP server, to which
you should respond by typing "A01 logout" to disconnect again.  If it
fails then you probably didn't get the inetd.conf line right, or didn't
manage to get inetd to reread the config file.

Now you should be able to set Pine to use IMAP to access your mail folders
(which involves changing their entries in the Setup Configuration screen
from things like "mailinglists" to "{imap.myhost.mydomain}mailinglists".)

HOWEVER whenever you start Pine up it will ask you to enter your username
and password so as to be able to authenticate you to the IMAP server.

Now we get back to the /etc/rimapd thing...

It is possible to set up a "pre-authenticated" version of the IMAP server
so that Pine can use the trusted "rsh" command to start the server, which
then magically deduces your username and trusts you are that user (by
virtue of the rsh mechanism).

This setting up is straightforward at the IMAP server level, but trickier
at the UNIX level (you may need help from others familiar with the
process)...

1.  (Easy bit) Set up a link so that /etc/rimapd connects to the real
    imapd executable (wherever you put it).  For example:

	ln -si /etc/imapd /etc/rimapd

2.  (Trickier bit) Now set up the UNIX rsh mechanism so that you can rsh
    to your server machine.  Typically this is done by you setting up a
    ".rhosts" file for your username *on the IMAP server machine* that
    names the machine you normally use to work on as a "trusted host".
    BE CAREFUL WHEN DOING THIS!  IF YOU GET IT WRONG IT CAN LET OTHERS GET
    ACCESS TO YOUR USERNAME, AND HENCE COMPUTER AND SITE!  SEEK EXPERT
    ADVICE IF YOU NEED IT!

    Alternatively this step can be obviated if the system manager sets up
    a system-wide file on the IMAP server listing trusted hosts (usually
    this file is called something like "hosts.equiv" -- I forget the
    directory).

3.  Test that you have set up the rsh mechanism properly by logging in to
    your normal work machine and giving the command:

	rsh imap.myhost.mydomain /etc/rimapd

    If all goes well you'll see a welcome banner like before, but saying
    "PREAUTH" near the beginning of the line.  Again, disconnect by typing
    "A01 logout" and pressing Return.

    Otherwise look at the error message and try and deduce the problem.
    This will either be with rsh (are you allowed to use it?), the trusted
    host list (you probably set up the .rhosts file wrongly), or the link
    from /etc/rimapd to the real imapd executable.

If you set this up Pine will no longer ask you to enter a username and
password when you start it up (assuming the IMAP server started up within
a given timeout period!).

Sites which decide NOT to set up the /etc/rimapd link should instead
include port 143 explicitly when setting up the folders.  For example:

	{imap.myhost.mydomain:143}inbox

This prevents Pine from trying the rsh mechanism first and then falling
back to a direct connection to port 143.  Instead it just goes straight to
port 143, which can make start-up a bit quicker.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell                                         <pmb1@york.ac.uk>

I used the following changes for PINE 3.94 on AIX 4.1.4 (build a41):

  Changed server_login in imap/ANSI/c-client/log_a41.h to match env.h. 

  Turned off optimization (-O3) in pine/makefile.a41.  The optimization
  did work, but compilation was very, very slow.  This may be why it
  appears to hang on you.  addrbook.c took the longest to compile with
  optimization.

  Turned off BACKGROUND_POST in pine/osdep/os-a41.h (though I'd like to
  use this feature eventually).

  Linked pico and pine with ncurses instead of curses (pico/makefile.a41
  and pine/makefile.a41).  This change seemed to help with a screen
  redrawing problem in pine 3.93 so I used it again with 3.94.

I can't guarantee that these are right and proper things to do, but things
seem to be working.  -- Mark Westergaard, U. of Arizona

At this time your only option is to create a sending filter to shuffle the

Subject: [Q]: Using the "SUBJECT" Field Info As A Header For Print Jobs...

Hello, All!

	I was wondering if anyone has been able to print a message (using
the custom command option) from Pine-3.93 that includes the "SUBJECT" line
information?  I am trying to pass the SUBJECT field to the custom script
that does my printing from the application and I can't figure out how to
access information.

	I know it is possible to use the "_FROM_" variable in the Reply-To
indent string, and if there is a way to access the SUBJECT field the same
way it would help immensely!!

	Thank you very much for your time and consideration!!

  Hi fellow Pine users!
    Now that procmail and Pine are happily working together...I thought I
  would share some -lessons learned- from this..umm..less-than-enjoyable
  -but-I'm-glad-it's-done experience.

   1. In searching the pine-info archives..I found a article that said you
   had to "enable incoming folders" in Pine and add a new folder collection.
   For this setup here (HP-UX with procmail already as primary mail delivery
   agent) I did not have to enable incoming folders. I _did_ have to make
   a new folder collection.

   2. Add the folder collection to pine using the "pine configuration" option
   in pine...so it moves your old collection down..and makes your new 
   collection the _primary_ collection and default for saves.

   3. As per the filtering faq, the "procmail/log" is a very useful tool..
   shows you _exactly_ what procmail is doing.

   4. I'll have a archive here soon...of .procmailrc recipes..scripts..etc.
   Procmail can do about anything you want it to.. except make a good cup of
   java..:)

  I am _now_ a expert on Procmail (hadn't planned on it) and will be more
  than happy to help anybody else setting it up with Pine. It's not _really_
  that hard once you know what to do...and how to do it right! :) It _really_
  saves me a tremendous amount of time...

    I think this is so.  From time to time I have received emails in
which the Date field was garbled and even I as a human reader could
only guess at it, so I doubt very much that a mail reader like Pine
could do much more than take some defined default action.  Apparently
mail transmission can proceed even if some non-critical header fields
have been mashed on along the way.

Text messages tend to compress well. Is there a way to compress mailboxes 
and still be able to access them with IMAPd?

I have the same problem too. But I have more info. I can use
a remote INBOX for all users, except root ! For the user root,
I get the same error message 'Can't connect to my.server;143,
connection refused.'

I don't understand, because rsh (and all other remote command)
works fine for root.

I don't remember exactly the message in '/var/adm/messages' but
it looks like imap closes the connection during authentication.

If someone knows why ...

Manuel.

How would I go about cofiguring my IMAP server so that there is a bunch 
of mailboxes that can be accessed by multiple people?

This would be great for e.g. helpdesk people and also for keeping mailing 
list archives for later access.

That is true, and that is also the correct flag. 

However I have found that some files which have very very long lines are
still wrapped nonetheless.

Hiya

I'm using PINE to access an NNTP server on a different machine via PPP.
It works quite well, except that I've got to manually get to the
newsgroups section (g,contol-p,name.of.newsgroup,enter).

I'd like to setup an 'initial keystrokes' list which will get me to the
first newsgroup automatically.

Anyone know how this can be done?

Please CC me on your reply, our Usenet feed sometimes cancels "old"
messages before they get out of the cradle ;-)

ELM does not have support for PGP yet.
However, there are several patches available.
You might want to thry the perl scripts first
as they are very simple to install as pseudo mailer and pager.

Info is on page

Well, a mailer that does support quite a lot, including
message/partial with automated merging, is some recent emacs (>=19.30)
with tm.  I haven't got the URL for tm handy, but if you are
interested I can find it for you. BTW: this mess(age) has been

Netcom has yet to install 3.94, but another user has it and I've been
using that.  I just tried the verbose feature and find that I always get
as the first line:

  050 Warning: alias database /etc/aliases.pag out of date

What does this mean?  Can this cause a problem for me in sending mail?

Subject: Putting non-address text in To: field - possible?
Date: 28 Jun 1996 22:18:12 GMT
Message-Id: <4r1ln4$t6t@vixen.cso.uiuc.edu>

OK, we've switched to Pine as our departmental mail software,
created distribution lists for staff and have been using Pine for
several weeks. Since then, I've had several staff complain that
every time a message gets sent to the entire staff, they have
to page through 40 e-mail addresses before getting to the
actual message. So, today I found that you can put the dist. list
in the Bcc: field to supress all those addresses, and you didn't 
need to put anything in the To: field. Problem solved! Or so
I thought. While staff like the idea of not having to page through
all the names, they do like to know who the message went to so
they don't forward the message to someone else in the office who
already received a copy. So is there a way to put the distribution
list name in the To: field without the program thinking it has
to send to that name. So someone could put "ALL STAFF" in
the to field and the dist. list nickname in the Bcc: field, and when
someone gets the message, they will see "ALL STAFF" instead of
<list suppressed> in the TO: field.

(Gosh, I hope all that made sense!)

TIA,
Mary

Somewhere I read that pine would be made so it could handle e-mails collected 
into one e-mail called "digest".

Is that possible in pine3.94 ? If not is it possible to say when that will be 
made ?

The problem below seems to disappear aftre using Windows Config
and selecting a font and a font size.
So can I assume this is a bug (maybe some DOS code got triggered
as long as there in no font specified ?) ?
Which is the "official" address to send bug reports ?

I used PINE 3.91 and now I'm using PINE 3.94.

I've got .addressbook* and pine-address* files in my $HOME..... do  
I need them both anymore?

I like a neat $HOME....

Thanks

Hi,

a few days ago I have installed pine-3.94 on a SCO machine (3.2.4.2).

How can I turn off 'quoted printable' transfer encoding? I 've found nothing
in the FAQ or in the menu SETUP CONFIGURE.

Thanks in advance

    Someone emailed me that "perl" above really refers to Perl 5.  On
my system, if I want Perl 5 I have to say "perl5" because Perl 4 is
still alive and well.

    However, even after making the change, Pine still locked up on me. 
The display would ripple (possibly due to a screen refresh) and "PIPED
MESSAGE" would appear in the message bar at the top of the screen. 
(BTW, I am using Pine 3.94 and dialing in with a PC emulating a
vt100.)  Things would more or less be locked up tight.  I could Ctrl-Z
back to a shell prompt and kill the Pine process, but that is about
all.  The only other command Pine would respond to is '?' to get the
prompts at the bottom of the screen (since I run with the prompts off
since version 3.93), and even then, none of the prompts would work.

    I wonder if there is some sort of problem with the latchup between
Perl and Pine in my configuration (SunOS 4.1.4).  Any suggestions
gratefully received, because it is truly annoying to try to read
messages with QP characters in them untranslated.

Mike Brudenell and others offered some right-on-targetr advice about
forwarding a bunch of messages to a different site for off-line reading at
a latter date/time.


My thanks to all (seven plus!) folks who wrote me with instructions.  One
or two of them were easy enough to follow and see the thing work in real
life.

Cool.

And if I want to send 8bit characters, without QP,
and I've got no E-SMTP ? What can I do ?
Wait for 3.95  perhaps ?

hi all !

i am trying to build for Solaris 2.5 on an ultra.  i get the following
compile time error :

reply.c: In function `generate_message_id':
reply.c:2495: `SYSTYPE' undeclared (first use this function)
reply.c:2495: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
reply.c:2495: for each function it appears in.)

the code there is :

  sprintf(id,"<Pine.%.4s.%.20s.%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d%02d.%d%c@%.50s>",
        SYSTYPE, pine_version, now_x->tm_year, now_x->tm_mon + 1,
        now_x->tm_mday, now_x->tm_hour, now_x->tm_min, now_x->tm_sec,
         getpid(), a, ps->hostname);

i fished, but the only thing i could find was references in the imap
directory of the form  $(MAKE) build SYSTYPE=non-ANSI OS=$@.

anyone have a clue about this ?

thanks !

    You can send your text as a MIME attachment (specified in the
header field -- use "Rich Headers" if necessary) _provided_ your
recipient is using a mail reader that can handle MIME attachments.

Hi,

I'm interested in using my 'jokes' folder from Pine 3.93 on a WWW site.
What I'd like to be able to do is:
	- create an HTML index of all the jokes in the folder listed by
	  subject (with a PERL program)
	- browse the folder by joke using pages created on the fly with
	  PERL

What I need to know is:
	- how does Pine know what the start and end of each email message
	is in a folder?
		- messages can be forwarded any number of times so just
		relying on the header doesn't seem possible.

Any help that can be given would be appreciated

Thanks,

Andrew

Hypermail will take a pine (imap) folder and turn it into a series of html'd files (one per
message) and also build a series of indexes.

   AIX-4.1.4
   PINE-3.94

   Compiling 3.94 on aix4.1 (build a41) produces
   tons of errors and finally hangs and never finishes!
   (using a32 is not any better,  it also hangs and generates a lot of 
   errors).

I have no solution as I get the same results on a41.
osf, hp, sgi, ult, sun and sol compiles just fine.
(sol demanded . in path though, no other did)

If you find a solution I'm very happy if this group gets notified!

Also there is a bug in Pine after v3.91; multilingual characters are
not sorted correctly. Or as the answer from the pine dev. group stated
"Not sorted at all". (Sort by subject).

How can I stop messages automatically being marked deleted in my inbox? 
It's slightly annoying.

Subject: Pine 3.91 inbox problems
Date: 29 Jun 1996 17:15:23 GMT
Message-Id: <4r3obb$o8k@uuneo.neosoft.com>


I'm using popclient (under FreeBSD 2.1) to poll my ISP and stuff my incoming 
mail into /var/mail/conrads, which I've told Pine to use as my inbox.  
Occasionally, if I have Pine running when new mail comes in, I get any of 
several errors in Pine.  Sometimes, I'll get an "access error", and pine 
says it closed the inbox.  Other times, I'll get an inaccurate count of 
new mail in the Inbox index, and when I open an item, no text is 
displayed, then upon returning to the index, the item's subject field 
will be blank.  Exit and restart Pine, and often it will turn out that 
there were actually several other new mail items that weren't even 
listed before.  Very odd.

Has anyone ever see this before?  Any idea what's wrong?

Currently I use pine to get news on my UNIX work station.  But instead of 
reading each news item one by one using pine, I like to save all items 
in a big file, quit pine, and then open the file using my favorite 
screen editor.  Then I can use keyword search and other functions of 
the editor to quickly find what I want to read and get rid of what I 
don't want to read.  That saves me a lot of time.

If I want to save all news items of comp.mail.pine into a file named 
PineNews, this is how I do it: 
1. Type 'pine' in a UNIX shell to start pine;
2. Enter the news group comp.mail.pine; 
3. Type: '; a a s PineNews y'
4. Quit pine

After that, I can find the file named PineNews which includes all news items.

Now, this is my question:  I want to write a UNIX shell script (or in any 
other programming language) to automatically save all news items into a 
file (instead of doing it manually according to the above 4 steps).  Is that 
possible? If yes, how do I do it?

Your help will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

This sounds like a job for expect written by  Don Libes  
<libes@cme.nist.gov>

ftp://tribble.cme.nist.gov:/pub/expect/expect.tar.gz (or .tar.Z)

you'll also need:

ftp://tribble.cme.nist.gov:/pub/expect/tcl.tar.Z (no .gz available)

I'm not sure exactly how it would work (I'm just learning expect)  
but Don's written a great book called "Exploring Expect" available  
at better libraries and book stores everywhere.

I love expect, and think that the book is well worth the $.

systems i activated auto-move-read-msgs, but my mail file in

    Make sure you have enable-aggregate-command-set in your
configuration.  ; won't work unless that is set.  If it is set, 
then you obviously have some other problem.

I just started to use Pine after using Elm for a long time.  One thing that
puzzles me is that I don't seem to see my username I specified in the .pinerc 
when I open Pine folder index.  Pine either pickup my name from password file,
put TO: in front of my address, or simply can not dispaly my name (blank). 
If I use Elm to see the same mail folder,  I can see my username appear
correctly.  I don't understand what is going on.  Could someone
tell me how to fix this problem?  Pine3.89 in Sun workstation and Pine9.1 
n HP workstation have this identical problem.

Go to main screen; use Setup and Config. Find the feature called

Subject: Reading uuencoded attachments
Date: 27 Jun 1996 14:42:35 -0400
Message-Id: <4qukmr$npr@cherokee.fore.com>


Not sure if this is pine specific or a mime/mailcap problem, but if
someone can help me I sure would appreciate it.

I have a message with a uuencoded text file as an attachment.
How can I read it?  I'm using pine 3.94.

I've tried setting display-filters to run uudecode, but that didn't help.
(maybe I have the trigger wrong?).

I've tried creating a mailcap entry (I've just started learning, so I
may not have gotten it correct).

Pine complains:

    Don't know how to unpack "X-UUENCODE" encoding


Pine gives the following details about the attachment:

                Type            : Text
                Subtype         : PLAIN
                Encoding        : X-UUENCODE
                Parameters      : NAME = SWHWOU~2.TXT
                                  X-MAC-TYPE = 54455854
                                  X-MAC-CREATOR = 74747874
                Approx. Size    : 1,975 bytes
                Display Method  : Can't, Unknown Encoding

Yes, I can save it to a file and run uudecode, but I'm hoping for a 
better solution.

Just moved to 3.94 (from 3.91) and my Thanks to the Pine Team, because
the new version feels very good, and seems to have many improved
facilities. 

One query:

The config settings enable-tab-completion and compose-cut-from-cursor
allow one to modify behaviour in the Composer, but don't seem to have
affect on the same functions when creating the message header: eg, ^K
still cuts the whole of a To: line, and TAB does not allow completion of
a filename being attached.  Is there any way to configure the behaviour
here consistent with these settings? 

    Thanks,
        
        I.

I've heard that it is possible for me to retrieve my POP3 email using Pine.
Currently, I'm using Pine 3.91 but plan on upgrading to a newer version
here when I install my new harddrive.  How do I go about setting 3.91 up to
retrieve mail via POP3, and can I set it up to remove mail from server, etc?
I've looked through all the setup I can see, and nothing looks very 
familiar to me.  Thanks, any comments sent via email appreciated too.

Has anyone successfully used PINE with a WYSE50 terminal?
I have many plain WYSE50 terminals that I would like to
use PINE on.

Thanks,

Hello,

A friend of mine presently visiting me in Canada would like
to check his mail on his account in France, through my own

how to establish the connection?
Thanks

This sounds to me like a misconfiguration of the listserver
header rewriting strategy.

Normally the address of the originator of the message should
be found in the From: header line and the address of the list
in the Replay-to: line.

This way, the selection of a private response versus a list
response is made at the From/Reply-To question asked by pine
when you reply a message with different From: and Replay-to:
fields (if you enable it from config).

Just an opinion.

	In addition to setting the auto-move-read-msgs option to "on", 
you must have specified a place for "read-messages" to go.  For example, 
I created a folder called 'Dead-file', and set the read-message-folder 
option to 'Dead-file' as well.  Now when you set the auto-move-read-msgs 
option, pine knows where those messages you want moved are to go.  Every 
time I log off, anything still in Inbox gets automatically moved over to 
Dead-file, clearing the Inbox every time.

    This is not necessary at first.  If you do nothing to your Pine
configuration, then by default it will pick up ~/.signature and insert
it.  You only have to make a change here if you want to use a file
named other than ~/.signature (or if, possibly, you have a .signature
file and do not want Pine to use it automatically).  Using the 
signature-at-bottom option is personal taste, although it was good to
mention it.  (Personally, I wonder why the Pine folks didn't make
_that_ the default.)
