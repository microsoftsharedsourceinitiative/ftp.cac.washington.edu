First, you'll have to talk to your ISP to determine what News server you
should use (it'll be the same one you're using for Tin).  Once you know
what it is, go into Setup/Config and select nntp-server.  Then type in the
name of the server (whatever.foo.bar - again, ask your ISP).

This should also set news-collections automatically.  In this case, it
would be *{whatever.foo.bar/nttp}[].  If you can, get together with your
ISP to set this since you just began using Pine.  Hope this helps!

    Old, old, old, old, old question answered many, many, many, many,
many times on this newsgroup.  You can go into your configuration (off
the Main Menu) and add the customized header:

        Return-Receipt-To: your_email_address

However, there is no Internet standard enforcing return receipts, so
there is no way to predict whether any particular email will garner 
you a receipt or not.  It all depends on whether the receiving system
honors your request, and it is not required to do so.  Even if you do
get a receipt back, it only says the message has been delivered.  It
says nothing about whether the message has been read (or even possibly
thrown away unread).

You might want to tell Pine that it shouldn't even try rimapd, but
should go directly to imap.  You can do that by adding the port number
afer the hostname, for example

	inbox-path={imap5.u.example.edu:143}INBOX

But wouldn't it be better to have your sysadmin fix the rimapd problem,
so that other people could use Pine also?

    Did you check out customized-hdrs in your configuaration?  You can
add a customized  Return-Receipt-To: your-email-address  on your own. 
(It is not there automatically.)  I hope you are aware that even with
this header, you will get a receipt only if the receving system honors
it, which it is not required to do, and it will tell you nothing about
whether the end recipient has actually opened and read your message.

    Can you provide us with more diagnostic data?  Just saying "my car
won't run" is not quite enough information for a mechanic to fix it.

    It would be good it you could include one of the returned mails
with the error messages in its entirety -- you can X out any personal
information.  Information of what version of Pine and what operating
system you are running under (so we don't have to try to dig that out
of the headers) is also useful information.  A copy of your Pine
personal configuration file would be good.

    My point is that too much information is far superior to too little
when it comes to diagnosing a problem.  As it stands, I have no idea
what the problem is without further data.

Hi:

There is a Perl program `unmbox' that will take a mailbox and split it
into individual messages (called `01', `02', `03' ...). You could feed
your mail folder to unmbox, and then run mp on each of the individual
files, sending the output of each to the printer. (*Very* handy script,
this `unmbox'!). My copy here at home does not have a net URL, but I
suspect you can find it at any CPAN site (that being the most likely
place that *I* found it).  If you can't find it, let me know, and I
shall email you my copy (it is quite short; I'd post it, but I haven't
the authors permission to do so).


Cheers!

James

    If you have a World Wide Web browser, browse

        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/

This is the "official" web page for Pine by its developers, and it has
a lot of extremely valuable material, including information on where to
get Pine.

: {mailhost.whatever.edu/user=snakey}INBOX

: The "user=snakey" makes pine understand that you want to use the same
: account every time you open the folder, and you only need to give the
: password once per session.

I tried this, and it does help a lot, but...  I have multiple incoming
folders, and so when I go to the folder list or try to "tab" to the
next incoming folder, pine asks me again for my password.  Ideas?

I accidentally found this neat feature of ^j (fill paragraph) in Pine.

I got an email with lines like these:

>I think
>Thursday
>is
>better
>for
>me.

I thought it would look terrible in my reply.  And it was terrible
until I hit the ^j (ctrl-j) in the paragraph.  Pine was able to
remove all the unnecessary ">" signs and make a nice paragraph!  
It ended up like this:

>I think Thursday is better for me.
>

I like it!

Hi, here is another info about another type of virus that my other friend
sent me and I don't know if this applies to me either, so you might want
to take a look at it.  I don't know if it is a joke either, thanks.

Hi! 
	My friend sent this to me and I am not sure if this applies to me.
So I thought you might help me with this and maybe be aware of this virus
too.







                   V I R U S - W A R N I N G
 
There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet. 
If you receive an email message with the subject line "Good Times",
DO NOT read the message, DELETE it immediately.  Please read the
messages below. Some miscreant is sending  email under the title 
"Good Times" nationwide, if you get anything like this, DON'T DOWN 
LOAD THE FILE!  It has a virus that rewrites your hard drive, 
obliterating anything on it. Please be careful and forward this 
mail to anyone you care about.

             WARNING!!!!!!!  INTERNET VIRUS

The FCC released a warning last Wednesday concerning a matter of
major importance to any regular user  of the Internet. Apparently a
new computer virus has been engineered by a user of AMERICA ON LINE
that is unparalleled in its destructive capability. What makes this
virus so terrifying, said the FCC, is the fact that no program needs to
be exchanged for a new computer to be infected. It can be spread 
through the existing email systems of the Internet. Once a Computer 
is infected, one of several things can happen. If the computer 
contains a hard drive, that will most likely be destroyed. If the  
program is not stopped, the computer's processor will be placed in an 
nth-complexity infinite binary loop -which can severely damage the 
processor if left running that way too long.  Luckily, there
is one sure means of detecting what is now known as the "Good Times"
virus. It always travels to new computers the same way in a text email
message with the subject line  reading "Good Times". Avoiding infection
is easy once the file has been received simply by NOT READING IT! 
The act of loading the file into the mail server's ASCII buffer 
causes the "Good Times" mainline program to initialize and execute. 
The program is highly intelligent- it will send copies of itself to 
everyone whose email address is contained in a receive-mail file or 
a sent-mail file, if it can find one. It will then proceed to trash 
the computer it is running on.  The bottom line is:  - if you receive 
a file with the subject line "Good Times", delete it  immediately! 
Do not read it"  Rest assured that whoever's name was on the  "From" 
line was surely struck by the virus.  Warn your friends and  local 
system users of this newest threat to the Internet!  It could save 
them a lot of time and money.  Could you pass this along to your global 
mailing list as well?

Man, the stuff you learn in this business.  
OK, so, from the above I learned that

   a)  FINALLY there's another name for the "Good
Times" spam; and
   b)  You can send people via e-mail.  Wonder what
*that* bit of news will do once the airlines hear about
it?

ROTFL :-)
Happy Friday!

Your syntax is incorrect as well.  It should be the same as John's example
but with the parenthesis replaced by {}'s:

incoming-folders="John's Inbox" {oak.ait.fredonia.edu/pop3}INBOX

Problem solved...  I realized that the name of my imap server really
resolves to one of two machines to balance the load.  I just picked
one of the two and now I only have to log in once per session!

Ok, I'll take the bait.  What do you find worthless about procmail?
Perhaps if you told us what the problem is you'd get a useful
answer.

<using procmail to filter harassing e-mails - SNIP>

Or you could use filter.  It is fairly easy to set up.  You put a line in
you .forward file like:

| /usr/local/bin/filter

and create a filter-rules file which includes a rule like:

if (from = "ex-boyfriends-address") then delete

and you will never see mails from this person again.  The filter can also
create a log to let you know about everying it does.  This information
(and much more is available by typing 'man filter' (no quotes) at your
shell prompt.  There is also probably a longer filter document on the
system there which will tell you more than you ever wanted to know about
filtering your mail.

If you wanted a slightly fancier solution you could have the filter reply
to mails from this person with an automated response saying that the mail
had been summarily deleted and would never be seen.

Good luck.

  A suggestion might be to take a look at

           http://www.ee.umd.edu/medlab/filter/filter.html

  "Information Filtering Resources"

  As for 'procmail', well, YMMV - personally I wrote my own filter when
I found procmail to be a) written in C, b) *huge*, and c) employing
rule-files that were *almost* incomprehensible. But again, YMMV.

I just upgraded pine on our Sparc from 3.89 to 3.95.  Testing it on
my own account, I get the following message

"Can't open mailbox lock, access is readonly"

I've even tried changing the permissions on /var/spool/mail/, but to
no avail.  Is pine unable to create the .lock file?  Is it not
flock()ing?

Any help is appreciated.

Those are files that Pine creates for sake of debugging in case the
program should mysteriously crash.  By default, Pine sets the debug level
to 1.  Everytime you run Pine, it makes a new debug file like in your
case.  To prevent these from being created, use the command 'pine -d 0'
(without the quotes).  This tells Pine to set the debug level to zero,
meaning that no debug file will be created.  Of course, you can set this
as an alias (if you're on Unix) or symbol (if you're on VMS).  As for me,
I set up a 'p' alias to run Pine at 0 debug level.  Lazy?  Yeah, but who
cares?  ;-)

    Uh, well, no, when I opened newsgroup comp.mail.pine, there was
your post sitting on top of the heap with your name in the index page. 
Please be aware that there is usually a difference in Pine between what
you, the sender, see, and we, the recipients, see.  We see your name. 
You see whom or what group you sent the message to.

    The design of Pine is that you are assumed to know your own name,
so that information is rather superfluous to you.  Whom you sent
something to you is assumed to be of more value, so that's what you
see.  On the other hand, when I open mail or news, your name is more
valuable to me, so that's what I see.  Nothing is broken.  That's just
the way it works.

	Is there a way to disable the "this is going out to thousands

	I am using Unix PINE version 3.91.

	Yes!

	It means you are using the *wrong* user agent.   If you check
the online help of Eudora you will find a section that tells you if
you get that error you need to switch to using "pine" as your
User Agent.  If you find it difficult to switch then you should
at least ask questions about Eudora on the Eudora newsgroup.  :-)

This has nuffin' to do with Pine but answers the question....

A better solution would be to edit /etc/aliases to include the line:

root: your_user_id

and then run the 'newaliases' command.

Then, all mail that's normally delivered to root will be delivered to your
non-root userid.

    In brief, No, if you want to know that the mail has been read. 
Please see my followup I made a few minutes ago to almost the same

How does one suppress the cc field on

longer than the message which is usually a few lines.

Is it possible to suppress the cc field on mail

She'll have to use a mail filtering program like procmail (or DELIVER if
she's on VMS).  I'm not familiar with procmail at all, so I can't offer
any pointers on how to set it up (I'm learning it slowly as we speak).
However, her ex-boyfriend could really get into trouble, for his actions
could possibly be labeled as harassment.  I say 'possibly' because it
depends on how she's treating the situation.  If she really wants him to
stop, she could request it by writing a letter to the 'postmaster' account
at his site.  Most postmasters are quite prompt at handling account
abuse.  Of course, I would treat this as a last resort, but do not
hesitate to do it when it's necessary!  Hope this helps!

What incantation did you use with formail?

I would think you'd want to do this:

	formail -s mp > somefile < mailfolder

This would run "mp" lots of times and keep appending the output to the
file "somefile".  If mp spits Postscript out on stdout, this should be
okay, since in general you can do this

	cat 1.ps 2.ps 3.ps > all.ps
	lp all.ps

with Postscript files safely.

An alternate way of doing it is to invoke a little shell to run your
pipe command and spool zillions of separate print jobs.  Bad idea if
you have a header page for each print job.  At any rate, you could
do that like this:

	formail -s sh -c 'mp | lp' < mailfolder

A better idea would be to make the script generate a zillion files,
then print them with one big command:

	formail -s sh -c 'mp > mail.$$.ps' < mailfolder
	lp mail.*.ps

If this is the kind of thing you've already tried, you might want to
look at the "mailfolder" file.  If you have been piping messages to the
formail program straight from pine, or you've used the "export"
(instead of "save") feature to create the "mailfolder" file, you should
be aware that both pipes and exports strip all kinds of header stuff
from the mail message, most importantly the "From " line (NOT the
"From: " line).  If formail does not see "From " lines, chances are
that it's not going to see the boundaries between messages.

Personally, I recommend marking all the messages you want to print,
then doing an aggregate save of them to a new folder ("~/mailfolder"),
then doing an aggregate undelete (since the save will have caused them
to be marked for deletion).  If you want to print all the messages in a
folder, then just copy the folder, or run formail with the folder as
its standard input.

Hope this helps.  I believe that the fact that an export does not
produce the same kind of data as a save is probably one of pine's worst
violations of the principle of least astonishment.  But hey -- overall
it's a pretty good program.

Interesting view.  If Export and Save used the same format, we wouldn't
have needed two different commands.

Hello, everyone!  When installing PINEOS2, the program seems to be trying
to use ASCII 85h as either a variable, or the drive letter.  I looked in
the docs, and PINERC, but didn't see anywhere a possible solution.  I
thinksomeone else had this same problem, but no answers seem to have been
posted.  Is there a workaround, or is there something I'm missing?  My
3.95 didn't come with that WATTCP.CFG (or whatever) file.  What should I
do?

Dear Sirs:
    I have already asked my local consultants about this and they said to
get in touch with you.
    The new address system works differently from the old and the
instructions are bewildering.  The only way I seem to be able to add a new
E-mail address is to find one I no longer want, erase its entries, and
write in the new one.  Obviously I shall soon run out of choices to erase.
    When I used the new form to create a new entry, it whizzed over to
something called DISTRIBUTION.  
    Reading Help did not help.  I shall appreciate any assistance you can
provide.  Thank you.

I need to be e-mailing text to an automatic program that sends my text 
out on the web and listserv.
But it always gets there full of =20 at the end of most lines, and lines 
are not at all nice to read. I really do not think the problem is just 
that I type my lines too long (typed up in Word, saved as text with line 
breaks, then cut&pasted or uploaded to PINE).

The guardian of the program tells me that I need to turn off MIME and 
QUOTED PRINTABLE (or some such thing).
Can anyone tell me how to do this (PINE 3.95 on AIX 4.1)?

Please e-mail me directly if you have an answer
Thank you, world.

PINE is strictly for electronic mail, and has nothing to do with chatting.
There are three ways you may be able to chat with another individual:
either through Internet Relay Chat (IRC), through the Unix 'talk' command,
or through a chat board you can usually access through 'telnet'.  You'd
probably want to speak to your system administrator to determine which is
the most viable option for you.

Hi Mike:

Thanks for the reply.  I am somewhat embarrased that the answer is
available in help - I looked at all the help I could think of
(including line-by-line in the configuration) but not in the Index
Page.  Mea culpa.

As an occasional user of Pine, I would find a complete help file useful.
It was not immediately clear to me that the answer lay in the Index Page -
I was thinking it was something I had changed in my configuration.  The
Index Page used to show my name, rather than To: x.x.x, in earlier
versions of Pine, so when it changed I assumed it was something I had
done.  A complete version of on-line help would, I think, have avoided
this problem: a search for all occurrences of "To:" would presumably have
hit (eventually) the answer.

Finally, I apologise for asking a frequently asked and answered question.  I 
couldn't find any reference to it in the FAQ, however.

Thanks for all the help: maybe my dumb question will be the catalyst
for a whole new era in Pine documentation.

Cheers,

John

From the "Good Times Virus Hoax FAQ", by Les Jones at macfaq@aol.com
and lesjones@usit.net:

"Q: Is an email virus possible?
  
"A: The short answer is no, not the way Good Times was described.
          
    The longer answer is that this is a difficult question that's
    open to nitpicking. Keep three things in mind when considering
    the question:

    1. A virus is computer specific. IBM PC viruses don't affect
       Macintoshes, and vice versa. That greatly limits the
       destructive power of viruses. (And notice that none of the
       Good Times warnings mention which types of computers are
       affected.)
    2. A virus, by definition, can't exist by itself.It must infect
       an executable program. To transmit a virus by email, someone
       would have to infect a file and attach the file to the email
       message. To activate the virus, you would have to download
       and decode the file attachment, then run the infected
       program. In that situation, the email message is just a
       carrier for an infected file, just like a floppy disk
       carrying an infected file.
    3. Some of the situations that people have dreamed up involve
       Trojan horses rather than viruses. A virus can only exist
       inside another program, which then automatically infects
       other programs. A Trojan horse is a program that pretends to
       do something useful, but instead does something nefarious.
       Trojans aren't infectious, so they're much less common than
       viruses.
            
       There are some email programs that can be set to automatically
       download a file attachment, decode it, and execute the file
       attachment. If you use such a program, you would be well
       advised to disable the option to automatically execute file
       attachments.
          
       You should, of course, be wary of any file attachments a

Is there support for threading USENET news articles in 
Pine? If not, does anyone know when we can expect it? I mean, reading
USENET news without threading support is riduculous, as the posts would
keep getting duplicated and cause embarrasment/needless flames, etc.

 I know that I can 'sort' by ordered subject to simulate threading but
this operation is TOOOOOO slow.

If the URL of a Web page is of the form
http://www.***.com/~username/***
or http://www.***.com/users/username/***,
then the email address of the owner will often be
username@***.com (no www.)
No guarantees, though.

Some pages will contain Mailto: links, which you can use to mail
people from within your Web browser. Many people put their address as
a Mailto: link on the bottom of their home page.

If you are using a Web browser and the current URL starts with http://
I would say you are on the Web. (Though you could be on a local Intranet,
if your place has one.)

Your letter appeared on a public mailing list and a Usenet newsgroup,
I would not consider either of those part of the WWW, for example.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Subject: Compiling Pine with non-default INBOX
Date: Sun, 03 Nov 96 04:16:02 GMT
Message-Id: <55h69m$9sa@news.interlog.com>


I am having trouble finding where to define the default INBOX that Pine uses. 
Now, Pine reads from /usr/spool/mail/$USER as the default inbox. I would 
prefer to have mail read from $HOME/.mail.incoming

I was considering as an alternative to recompiling placing the new inbox in 
the pine.conf file. It seems, though, that although Pine recognizes the $USER 
variable, it does not recognize the $HOME variable.

If anyone has any insight into this problem, I'd like to hear it.

Thanks,
         Bob

My university uses PINE 3.91 and I have a question regarding how I
might change my email address in the header.  PINE's default seems to be
to put my account name before the domain as my email address.  I would
like to change this to my preferred email address:  bobthecow@niu.edu

I can't seem to find a way to do this.  If anyone can help me to change
the email address that PINE sends in the FROM: field when I send
messages, please let me know how I might do that.  Thank you in advance
for your suggestions.

What *exactly* did you try that led to this conclusion?

	I have set up my 25 or so folders in my folder collection(s).  I
arrange for both sent and received mail to go into these folders based on
the subject matter of the email.  This seems to work quite well, but my
folders are all starting to get quite large (~700 messages is not
uncommon) and slow to use. 

	In lieu of better suggestions I would like to have pine
automatically "prune" my folders each month like it does with sentmail. 
Is there any way I can specify ALL my folders in the "pruned-folders" 
setting WITHOUT actually listing each and every one ? 

	The other problem is that according to help, the pruned-folders go
into the folder collection which is the default for saves.  Can I have
them go into different folder collection(s) ? 

	Even better would be to have something like a folder collection
set up for "backups" into which all the pruned-folders go each month just
leaving me the "current" stuff in my other folder collections.  Something
like this anyway.  Any ideas ?

	Any other suggestions for doing this "pruning" of my folders so
that they remain at a manageable size while still keeping all my old email
around if I need it are most welcome as well.

	Please reply by email to S.Oldfield@nla.gov.au

Thanks in advance

I've had mixed results on HPs.  I recently tried it on 9.01 and it didn't
work ("biuld" died when compiling "send.c" when making Pine).  Out of
curiosity, I tried it on the lone machine we have running 10.20 and it
went fine.  

So I'd recommend giving it a try. 

Greg

PS - Any recommendations for my 9.01 problems would be greatly
appreciated.

All accounts are on the same machine, so maybe I'm just doing something
wrong.  Actually, I believe it worked when I set it up for just two
incoming folders (the INBOX plus a secondary incoming folder), but then
it started asking me passwords again after I added more.

Or, if like me, you haven't quite got procmail working yet, try the following:

In your .pinerc, setup alternate incoming folders like so:

incoming-folders=ACCOUNT2 {xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}/var/spool/mail/accountname,
		 ACCOUNT3 {xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}/var/spool/mail/otheraccountname,
		 JOEBOB   {127.0.0.1}/var/spool/mail/joeb

Where ACCOUNTx & JOEBOB are the folder names displayed, xx.xx.xx.xx are the
IP address of your machine(s), and the /var/spool/mail... lines are the actual
system mailboxes for the accounts.

In this case, you must set these as {host}/mailbox, in order to force userid
and password checking.  If you try to access them as files, i.e. 
ACCOUNT2 /var/spool/mail/name, you'll get a "permission denied" message.  With
the {host} syntax, you'll get in, as long as you know the userID's and passwords.

I had trouble with using {localhost}, but I *think* that's because my /etc/hosts
file is a bit screwy.  127.0.0.1 worked, as is my FQDN.  

I wasn't able to access my root account from my sbuntin account, though.  This is
probably a good thing.  If you're root as well as a mortal user, you'll need to
run pine as root to access everything including root.  This is a bit more involved
than .forward'ing everything to one account, but you've still got separate folders.

    You can control whether or not Pine will include attachments in the
reply.  Go into the configuration and look for  include-attachments-
in-reply  (something like that: I am going from memory).

Date: Wed, 30 Oct 1996 01:42:46 GMT

Hi.  I use pine, and I have an IMAP folder on a remote system
that I want to access.  I have added by going to my list of
incoming folders and adding this specification:

	{remotehost}folder

However, my user-id on the remote host is actually different than on
the local host.  It prompts me with the wrong one and I have to re-type
the right one every time I access the folder.  Is there a way I can
tell pine to use an alternate user name on that host?  I'm imagining
what you can do with Unix "rcp" or "rdist" or even "rdump", i.e.
something like

	{username@remotehost}folder

or maybe even

	{remotehost!username}folder

Just curious.

Thanks,
  Logan

Message-Id: <55jggf$bgr@grivel.une.edu.au>

I've got a few problems with procmail and pine. Assuming a piece of mail
passes through all the filtering rules, I want it to go to
/var/spool/mail/dbromage. Instead, the "default" mail folder appears to be
/use/dbromage/mail/? 

? is a very strange name for a folder since I do not have the ? character
anywhere in my .procmailrc

Cheers

: Why don't you just use pkzip to make it a different file.

Or just include it directly in the body of your mail message? RTF files
are just a plain ascii file in any case - why bump up the size by sending
them as a Mime attachment?

    Once upon a time I seem to remember one of the Pine Development
Team commenting in passing that killfiles were at least under
consideration for a future version of Pine.

Locking is the same in Pine 3.95 as it was in Pine 3.91.

The only difference is that in 3.95, a problem with locking is reported,
whereas in 3.91, it silently proceeded.  In other words, 3.91 (and earlier
versions) is happy to allow your mailbox to be corrupted, whereas 3.95
gives you a warning that there may be a problem.  All it takes is bad
luck; have mail delivery happen at the same time Pine does a rewrite of
the mailbox (checkpoint or expunge). 

On a few systems (e.g. FreeBSD) the lock failure warning really is
spurious.  It was initially to BSD specifications that the code was
written, hence the past practice of silently proceeding.  But most systems
today are not BSD, and even the majority of BSD systems follow the SysV
locking convention (which can have the problem) and not the BSD locking
convention. 

If your computer center reverted to 3.91 because of this warning, they've
swept the underlying problem under the rug.

Try {remotehost/user=username}folder then it'll only ask for the password.

The computer folks at GWU told me ya'll are the ones to talk to about this:

Why isn't there some way (or maybe there is, and I just don't know it) to
find out someone's GW e-mail address when you're in the compose message
mode?  If you need to send someone a message and you don't have their
address, you have to close your e-mail (which is so slow to open and
close) and go out to that earlier screen that lets you find an address and
then go back into your e-mail (which is so slow....).

Can someone using PINE find out someone else's e-mail address while in 
the compose message mode?

I don't think I gave my address for ya'll to respond... it's 
gretchen@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu

Thanks,

Gretchen Reilly

Unless you've set GZIP="--best" in your environment, you could get better
compression (at the expense of longer compression time) by adding a -9
or --best to the gzip command.

Actually I wonder if it might be a pine problem.  Due to widespread
mailbox-lock errors (and other bugs I'm not aware of) the computer center
here has reverted to pine 3.91.

At least one point: Export translates message to local conventions (I
believe, it even translates between transport and local character sets)
and Save leaves message intact, which is quite correct.

If you ever change it, you will hopelessly break one of them

Hehe.  And all this time I thought the essential difference was that
save marks a message to be deleted, while export doesn't.  To me, save
was analogous to Unix "mv", whereas export was analogous to Unix "cp".
I had assumed the change in format was an unintentional inconsistency.

Makes sense this way, though.

Ummm... I think you're confusing different screens here?

It is quite possible -- probable even -- that Pine is showing you "To:
username" in the Index screen (in the column you see the sender's name for
messages you receive from others).  This is quite separate from the
Subject text (which is at the right hand end of each entry's line in the
Index screen.

When you start a Reply I would be really surprised if you're getting
anything untoward; could I ask a silly question: have you tried it (as
against _assuming_ what will happen)?

> How to I fix "rsh IMAP connection timed out" when connecting to

This implies that you have got your Pine configured to use IMAP rather
than NNTP to read Usenet News from your news server.

First check that you have set a value for "nntp-server" in your Pine
Configuration Screen.  You will need this setting in order to be able to
_post_ articles to Usenet News.

Setting this also implicitly sets up a "news collection" configured to use
NNTP to the same server for news _reading_.  In most cases people just
need to set a value for nntp-server, and should leave the (related)_
news-collections variable _unset_.

>From the appearance of the error message I suspect that you have a value
set currently for news-collections.  Either unset this or, if you *really*
need it make sure it looks something like this:

	news-collections=*{news.your.site/nntp}[]

The important part is the "/nntp"; it is this that tells Pine to use NNTP
to connect to this server for news reading.  If you miss "/nntp" off then
Pine uses the IMAP protocol to try and read news instead.  If your news
server isn't running an IMAP daemon configured to serve the news then it
won't work for you!

A far better solution (in that it will benefit all the recipients rather
than just yourself) is to contact the person who sends out the message and
ask them to use the Blind Carbon Copy (BCC) header to list the intended
recipients rather than Carbon Copy (CC).

CC shows the full list of recipients to each recipient; BCC suppresses the
list.

Note that to prevent some misconfigured mail delivery agents (the software
receiving and delivering the message on each recipients' system) still
revealing the list as a series of "Apparently-to" headers a "To:" header
should be supplied.  This could be the sender's own e-mail address (in
which case they'll get a copy of the message back themselves).
Alternatively the magic fake e-mail address along the lines of:

	Name of list:;

will work (Note the magical ":;")

In fact if they are using Pine 3.93 or later and a Distribution List they
can short-cut this to just putting the lists's nickname in the "Lcc:"
(List Carbon Copy) header field.  This will automatically fill in a
suitable "To:" field value derived from the full (descriptive) name of the
list, and use BCC to list the intended recipients.

Cheers,

Another solution to avoiding the .pine-debugN files is to compile Pine
from the source code without the '-DDEBUG' command line option amongst the
other C flags.  This gets rid of the debug files once and for all (so if
you want to trace a problem you'll need to compile up a DEBUGable
version).

Note that the pre-compiled executables are compiled, I believe, *with* the
-DDEBUG option, and hence produce the files (unless invoked with the '-d
0' commandline option already referred to).

{Isn't it strange how people never seem to tell you the whole story, or
even enough for you to answer properly... :-}

You said in your message that you're using a Macintosh.

I'm *assuming* you are using and talking about the Pine mail program
(mainly because you're asking for help in a forum about the Pine mail
program, and also because you mention the "Export" command, a term not
used by many other mail programs).

Next thing: I *know* that Pine is not available as a program for a
Macintosh (an icon you can double-click to get Pine running with a full
Mac interfaxce).  So I'm *assuming* that you are running some sort of
terminal program to login to a mainframe computer (running UNIX?) and
using Pine there.

If I'm right in these assumptions...

When you use Pine's "Export" command a copy of the message is placed in a
file in your home directory on the (UNIX?) mainframe.

This is not the same as your Mac's own hard disk.  To get it there you
will need to use some sort of file transfer program on your Mac (and
possibly also on UNIX) to copy the file across from your home directory
down to your Mac's hard disk.

Such a program could be something like Anarchie or Fetch (if your Mac has
an Ethernet-type connection) or Kermit or Xmodem (if you have only a plain
serial link).

Only you or people at your site know what software isinstalled on your
computer(s).  Please ask your local help desk for assistance.

Cheers,

			Hello,

	We are running PINE on PCs ( Win 3.11 and Win 95 ) as
"free-service" terminals for students. PINERC is configured to run PC-PINE
as IMAP client. Each student who runs PC-PINE, enter his login and
password to read/send mail on the IMAP server.
	For such a configuration, I use the syntax user-id="" in PINERC.
This is working quite good, but each time the user tries to send a
message, PC-PINE asks to confirm the "user-id for from address".

	I am just wondering if there is a way to prevent PC-PINE from
doing that.

	Of course, the syntax inbox-path={imaphost/user=login} is not
possible here, since the imap host is accessed with different login names
from the same PC-PINE.

	Sory for the poor english !... Thanks for your help.

    No, you cannot use chat with Pine.  Pine and chat are two entirely
separate functions that have nothing to do with each other.  As for how
to chat, I suggest contacting your Help Desk, if there is one, or
looking for a newsgroup that deals with chat-type functions.  (I do not
use chat myself, only ytalk, so I am not familiar with it.)

If you've got the unbundled C compiler, patches to the compiler are available
at
	http://us.external.hp.com/patches/html/ptc_hpux.html

Alternately, you could try compiling just send.c with less optimization or
different flags, to see if the compiler problem is being triggered by the
flags you're passing it.

Is there a compile-option or a setup-option to have also in 
pine the presentation for only one message in the case of 
   Content-type: message/rfc822?

If I've missed this in the documentation or online help, please give
me a hint where to look.  Otherwise, can anyone explain to me how I can
curb pine so that it doesn't feel the need to rewrite its .pinerc everytime
it runs?

I can see many situations where pine would need to rewrite the .pinerc, 
but it appears that it rewrites it *every* time it runs.  This seems
excessive.

This question comes about as the result of some drive activity profiling a
friend did on a busy multi-user machine.  It was determined that the majority
of the writes on the drives housing his users' home directories are coming 
from pine rewriting its .pinerc.

An RTFM reply is welcomed, if you indicate the FM.

Thanks!

Tim

OK, my system has procmail, and I've gotten it set up far enough that I can have
mailing lists sorted into different folders.

Problem is, my system doesn't have the man pages for procmailex, so I don't know
how to use procmail & Pine to:

A) Toss all mail from a certain IP address into /dev/null and send a "your mail
was trashed unread" message in response.

and

B) Same as A), except sort by keyword in header or body. (As in "autoresponder,"
test," etc.)

If somebody wants to send me a copy of a typical .procmailrc that accomplishes
these things, that would be wonderful. If I just get a pointer to a FAQ that
spells it out for the non-programmer, that would be fine as well.

Thanks in advance.

<snip>

Along these lines, is there a feature that I may have missed that prevents a
user from firing up more than one session of pine? (currently using 3.93).

We use a "windowing" software for AIX Unix and sometimes a user will forget
that they have a pine session running in one window and fire up another one in
another window.

Has anyone written a script to prevent this type of event?

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Hmmm...  How do both machines get to your folders?  If they access
them via NFS, you are vulnerable to locking failures, at least with
the UW imapd.  This could lead to folders getting corrupted.  It is
safer and more efficient to have imapd running on the server that
physically stores the data.  I wouldn't be suprized if the savings in
NFS overhead completely offsets the extra imapd load of putting
everything on one server....

You have to have root previlidge (be a sys adm) to set up an IMAP
server.  It is not your job.  It is your ISP's job.  You should ask
them.  It is quite easy to do if they want to set up one.

Even if the server is equipped with IMAP server, you may not see
any man page for it, unless such man pages are installed (not 
likely).  You can do a telnet to port 143 to test it it exists.
For example, I can "telnet ucunix.san.uc.edu 143" and see the
greetings from the server.  I had to use ^] to get out of the
telnet connection (quit, exit and bye all fail to kick it off).
You are warned ... :-)

Just my 2c.

Just a guess, but I think yours is running Unix, System V, Release 4.0.

I'm not sure if this msg was ever received, and since I didn't receive any
responses, I'll try it again...


I've been putting off this question, hoping to resolve the problem on my
own, but I haven't had any luck.  Whenever I attempt to print a message
using ^Y (attached-to-ansi set in config file), everything cooks along
just fine, my software (Procomm Plus/Windows) indicates that it's
operating in "dedicated print mode", but just when the job is about to
print, I get an HP msg indicating a printer port problem.  When I look at
Print Manager, I see that the printer (HP DeskJet 540) is in "pause" mode
& to resume the print job only sends up the same port problem message
again.

Some info that might be helpful:

I'm using Pine 3.94 (didn't have this problem with the previous version),
my comm port is COM2 & my printer is LPT1.

Any suggestions would be most appreciated.  I've already tried disabling
Print Manager but ended up with the same problem.

Many, many thanks!

Well, Pine does not do any filtering (that is left to outside programs
that are specifically made for this purpose (see the threads about
procmail and filter)).

Having the facility for killfiles (with e-mail) would mean that Pine would
have to do some pre-processing of the mail as it arrived.  This is
typically done by filter programs, so would not be handled by Pine.

It seems that it would be more likely for Pine to incorporate killfiles
when reading news as Pine handles all the fetching and display of
newsgroups and there is not another external program that would handle the
filtering of these articles.

I suppose it would be possible for someone to write an interface between
Pine and your filter program of choice, thus making it easier for the user
to control the filtering process.

According to the documentation, background sending is still in its
experimental stages (v3.95).  I was also interested in making this a
default (instead of it being an option at the bottom of the screen), but
there's no current setting to make it permanent.  Maybe you could suggest
it to the Pine development team.  Oh, in case anyone is interested, I've
had no problems using background sending.  It's quite nice except for one
minor grievance.  You can only have one background at a time, but it's
nothing major.  It's still a nice feature.

My answer was a bit off, I said that when set, it will be a '>' when
the link is slow, and otherwise it will be inverse video.

It seems that when set, it will always be '>', and possibly when not
set it will depend on the speed. But I rather suspect that pine does
not check the actual speed at all, but just relies on this option?


One thing that occured to me: maybe after you quit pine the first time,
or while running the other application, your terminal settings become
garbled, so that Pine does not know _how_ to do inverse video?

Try to remove your TERMCAP variable ('unset TERMCAP') before starting
Pine the second time and see if it helps. If you use xterm you might
also want to do a 'resize'.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I've got a little question for all interested.  I am currently running
PINE 3.93 and I'm not sure how to do the following.  I want to list in my
address book listing under the FCC: option, a folder, that isn't in /MAIL.
I have 3 folders: /MAIL /FOLD1 /FOLD2.  Now if I want it to FCC: into a
file say 'topic1' in folder /FOLD1, how do I do that?  Or can I?  I tried
listing it as: FCC: FOLD1/topic1, but it comes up with "file FOLD1/topic1
isn't a folder in /MAIL, create? and when I try to creat it it gives me
an error, and doesn't send the mail. :(  Am I dreaming, or is this
possible (short of changing my defult save directory)?

Please e-mail all responces as I don't get time to read news all the time.
:(

Thanx in advance.

Subject: MacIntosh, Pine and extended Characters?

A friend of mine has a MacIntosh and uses the Pine program for email. We
correspond in German, so that there are some extended characters (Umlaute,
those with two points on top).

I post Umlaute with Mime, quoted printable, but she can't see them. If she
replies the Umlaute, I can see the characters as I posted them.

This are the Mime settings in her mail:
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE

So what can she do for seeing my Umlaute. And how can she do it?
(I've never seen this Pine program)

Thanks.

hello,

i have set in my pine conf the character set to iso, when i receive iso
encoded messages from other users, it works if there is no X.400<->SMTP
conversion on receive, but it doesn't work when i send. The only cases
where it works is when the other person also uses pine (seems to me)...

I have recently tryed to send files through attachment to a friend of mine
who is on a sun and to my father (X.400) in both cases it didn't work...

What possibities exist to find the source of the problem (pine,
MTA(sendmail), mail exchanger, bridge etc...) and what test should i run?
Does pine decide when to generate quoted-printable? Can this behaviour be
controlled. I tryed to receive on my machine MIME compliant sendings
composed of a note in iso-latin 1 char set + attachments, but the
attachments are uuencoded in the note, separated by:
_________________________________________________
--smxr-96110511082010673
Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name=PAD1.TXT
Content-Transfer-Encoding: Base64

an then the uucode

and for example the german umlauts appear this way:
=94=3do mit Umlaut
=84=3da mit Umlaut
=81=3du mit Umlaut
=e1=3dscharf s
=82=3d e accent aigu
=8a=3de accent grave

seems to me to be quoted printable, but i am not an expert....
if i send an attachment, there too it appears merged with the note...

any help will be appreciated

I encountered a similar trouble several months ago, except
that my folders vanished completely (were deleted).  I was
using 3.95.  I downgraded then to 3.94, but the bug was still
there(!).

I made a bug report then, but got no answer at all.

As countermeasure, now I made my ~/Mail directory read-only,
that is nobody can add or remove folders from there.  Since then
no folder vanished anymore, but pine gets sometimes upset and
crashes! :-)

Just to mention, since on this Sun box I am the administrator,
I am sure there was no configuration change to justify this
strange behaviour of pine.  I was pretty astonished, because
I use pine since 3.89 and never got such problems.

Great tool this pine, however!

Mihai L.

I would like to be able to mark posts as 'delete' in the newsgroups, so
that they'll be eXluded. I find that I can do this on a per-post basis,
but I would like to mark a group of posts, or all the posts in a
particular newsgroup, for example, with one command. Is this possible in
Pine?

My girlfriend encountered the same disk error over on Netcom some time 
ago. It turned out that there was a file placed in her /mail directory 
which had a suffix of "lock". I have no idea how that strange file got 
there, but removing it solved the problem. It's been so long ago that I 
don't remember whether the file was called inbox.lock or some strange 
number followed by .lock. All I know is that  Netcom was acting really 
flakey that day and there was no apparent reason why those .lock files 
should be there, so I got rid of them. Problem solved. 
CHEERS!

As was stated in another followup, configuring an IMAP server to allow
you to retrieve your messages is the job of your ISP.  This is a server
process, not a client process.  Until your ISP provides IMAP services,
you are stuck.  (By the way, most of the time typing "man imap" will NOT
return anything unless there is a man page for a command named "imap".
From what I have seen, most IMAP servers run a process called "imapd".
The "man" command expects an exact match unless you supply a "-k" option.)

Be aware that some ISPs are less than thrilled with having IMAP because of
the possibility of users leaving mail on the system using up disk space.
They really want users to stick with a POP3 type operation where the
mail is downloaded and deleted.

Now, another possibility is that instead of using "popclient" you may
want to look into using "fetchmail".  "fetchmail" is the successor to
"popclient".  It may take care of the problems that you are experiencing.
No knowledge of any certainity though.

Just tried out "popclient" again and duplicated your problem.  What
appears to be occuring is the "popclient" adds an additional header line
which some mail clients interpret as the beginning of another new message.
(At least this is what appears to occur with the "Elm" mail system, "Pine"
may have the same type problem.)  Actually, it appears the "popclient"
adds two "From POPmail" header lines to each message.

You may want to track down the new "fetchmail" which may fix your
problem.  Or you can always strip out the extra header lines introduced
by "popclient" to solve your problem.  Either way, it will be simpler
than trying to set up an IMAP server.

If you look at the options available at the bottom of the screen you will
see that (while reading):
"w" followed by "^V" (control + v) takes you to the bottom
"w" followed by "^Y" (control + y) takes you to the top
and while composing (in pico) use ^W rather than w then ^v or ^y

Hope that helps ... BYE

---------- Forwarded message ----------

I recently changed internet providers.  The question I have concerns the
"From:" address.  I have a Domain "CAPFUND.COM" and I have configured my
.pinerc file to include a customized header with the "From:" address being
"jrapp@capfund.com".  My problem is that the custom headers are not
functioning and when I send a message or reply the address is
"capfund@capfund.com".  The only suggestion I have been given by the sysop
is to do my email in Eudora or another IP program.   Can you assist me.  I
am very comfortable with pine and would like to remain with pine as long
as this problem can be eliminated.  Thanks

The way you're using it, it wouldn't being your INBOX is in another directory.
I was warning against someone else taking your lead and applying the same 
procedure to their INBOX, which is a bad idea.

Right, but since many Unix machines have world write access on the mail
spool directory (generally with the sticky bet set), you *could* (but
shouldn't!!) run gzip on your mail spool file too.  It was doing this that
I was warning against.

Sure.  If you do any mail filtering via an external program such as procmail,
filter, et. al., and the messages are filtered into folders in your mail
directory, then the same problems would occur.  You just need to guard against
compressing a mail file that could have new mail appended to it.  That's
all I'm warning about.

You'll need to grab the source code (if you don't have it already you can
get it at ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine3.95.tar.gz or something
like that) and recompile with one change.  cd into ./pine3.95/pine/osdep
then edit the os-lnx.h (for Linux - judging by the message id in the message
headers, that's what you're running) file.  Go to line 71, uncomment #define
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and save it.  Compile it, and then it will allow the
From: custom header.

I have never used mp, so I have no opinion. But if you are using formail you
may do (e.g.): cat folder | formail -k -X From: -X To: -X Date: -X Subject:
-X Message-ID: -s > newfolder

Note the "-s" switch! For the rest: man formail. Perhaps it is advisable to
write a shell script which does all the tasks automagically (saving of the
original folder, filtering with formail, saving the new folder).

I had the same problem a while back.  I'm not sure if I was using the same syntax,
though.  I assume comm-dir-com has multiple servers? It's possible that
com..dir..com defaults to a particular machine which does not provide pop3 service,
while mail type stuff should go through another machine - try one of the following: 

 {pop3.commercial-directory.com}travagt       or
 {mail.commercial-directory.com}travagt

One of these might just work.

Hmm.  Instead of the customized header, try :

personal-name=jrapp
user-domain=capfund.com

Works for me.. My machine has the rather unimaginative name of "linux.scott.net",
but mail shows up as "sbuntin@calweb.com".  Now I just need to fix my newsreader
to do the same.

Subject: Problem with custom prints scripts in 3.95
Message-ID: <1996Nov4.093354.8659@venus.gov.bc.ca>
Date: 4 Nov 96 09:33:54 PST

We're running into a problem with using a custom print script, where
Pine keeps trying to treat arguments to the script as filenames.

I've put it in a 'personally selected print command' as:
       Printer List: ""                      print_pine -bl06

In this case, "-bl06" is intended to be an argument to the script
print_pine.  When only print_pine is called, it works great.  When
the option is there, we get this error on the screen:

          [PRINT Result: Can't open -bl06: No such file or directory]

This has me completely baffled.  I'm fairly certain it's not the
script, but if somebody wants to see it, I have no problem in posting
it as well (it's a short Perl script).  Any ideas?

Jason

i'm running pine 3.95 under linux and am wondering as to whether or not
mailbox passwords may be saved in some way or not.  i am accessing
mailboxes on a unix server via imap and am quite tired of entering my
password each time.

thanks in advance for any info.  direct email would be the most useful as
i don't read this group often.

Use the 'bounce' command ('b').  You might have to enable it in your setup
first.

Hyuck, Hyuck.... Very true. I always wondered about this myself but didnt
get any replies back from wise folks out there. Guess the only way is

I had a .newsrc file produced by "tin". The lines were like

siemens.graz.test: 1-4

Pine refused to read any News, it just complained: No messages (or alike).
It only worked when I removed the numbers in each line, but now tin marks
all news as unread. Is this a desired behaviour of Pine?

I'm really biting my tongue on this one....For all the non-hackers out
there, do the following:

edit your .pinerc file located in your home directory.
find the text "feature-list" and add the following line to it:

	news-post-without-validation

save the file and restart pine.


**********bonus************
while you're at it, add the following line to quit without that
annoying "are you sure you really want to quit" message:

	quit-without-confirm

	It is best *not* to use the bounce command in this case.  Why?
Because bounce does not alter the original header that was typed in
error.  So, if you have a To: which is bad and Cc: which is good 
and the person on the Cc: list does a reply their reply will bounce
too.

	So, I would recommend using the forward from the sent-mail
folder and do whatever minor editing you need to make it look
"right".  The other way is to save the message from the sent-mail
folder to the postponed-mail folder and do a compose.  You'll
be prompted to resume composing.  Take it from there.....

I'm running Pine 3.95 under Linux also and rather than using IMAP or POP3
within Pine to read my mail, I use fetchmail to 'fetch' the mail from my
ISP's Linux mail server, then save it to /usr/spool/mail/username.  Then I
run procmail to split it up into folders (each mailing list into it's own
folder).

Check http://nll.home.ml.org/software.html and look for the link to
fetchmail's author's home page.  ...or I think you can get it at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Mail.

How does your friend use Pine on Mac?  I assume it is done through a telnet
login.  If that is the case, it is up to the telnet software to display the
character set.  Try the freeware NiftyTelnet and see if it helps.

Alternatively, your friend can use MailDrop to access all the IMAP folders
in the account where Pine has created them.  I like MailDrop alot.  Make
sure you use the latest beta version.  Older versions are too simple and
don't work too well.

NiftyTelnet's home page is at:

MailDrop's home is at:

Subject: Pine with VMS-Style Folders
Message-ID: <1996Nov6.125314.21051@guvax>
Date: 6 Nov 96 12:53:14 -0500

Hello, all:

I am using PC-pine 3.93 (I can upgrade, if necessary) in conjunction with
Innosoft's PMDF IMAP server to connect to an Alpha System running OpenVMS
with OpenVMS-Style Mail and Mail folders.  I want to be able to use the 
folders that are stored remotely on the VMS system, rather than using 
folders local to my PC. 

PC-Pine has successfully created a folder on its own.  It created a 
"/sentmail" folder that contains a message I sent using PC-Pine.  This 
leads me to believe that PC-Pine CAN deal with VMSMAIL-Style folders.  

The problem is, I have had trouble making PC-Pine make folders that I decide
on.  For instance, I wanted to save a new mail message to a folder (on the 
OpenVMS system) called "history".  I used the trusty old 's'ave command from
PC-Pine and entered "history" when prompted for the folder name.  I get a 
message back from pine that says "Busy" and pine just waits and waits... until
I crash out of it from Windows 95.

I figure that I've got a piece of syntax wrong at the PC-Pine config end of 
things.  I simply enter {vmssystem.domain.edu}NEWMAIL as my inbox specification
and enter {vmssystem.domain.edu}/[] as my folder collection. 

My question is... Is there anyone out there who has successfully used
PC-Pine to remotely access and correctly use VMSMAIL-style mail folders?
If so, will they tell me what I am doing wrong?

TIA  

Jay Whittle

Is there a way I can get pine to automatically file stuff into different

criteria, so that I can separate out stuff from the different mailing
lists I subscribe to?

many thanks in advance.

    Just for fun, try  Ctrl-W Ctrl-V  and  Ctrl-W Ctrl-Y  to see
what happens either viewing or composing.  :-)  (I think you might 
be pleasantly surprised with the results.)

    Killfile capability may be under consideration for a future version
of Pine, but only the Pine Development Team can speak properly to this.

Did anyone notice that the functions ^T <to address book> and ^T <Spell
Check> don't work? Is it just my account or is there a problem in this
edition of pine?

Knowledge to the problem is greatly appreciated.

    OK.  First, Pegasus mail is a proprietary system which might or
might not conform to Internet standards.  Just because Pegasus does it
does not mean you can do it anywhere on the Internet.  And as a matter
of fact, there are no Internet standards (so far as I know) regarding
return receipts.  It's rather much a crapshoot.

    More specifically, there simply is no Internet-wide way to get 
confirmation back that a recipient has read a particular piece of mail. 
Sorry, but you're just out of luck on that one.

    Sometimes is is possible to get a return receipt back indicating
that a particular piece of mail was placed in a recipient's mailbox,
and nothing more.  Go into your Pine configuration and add the
customized header

        Return-Receipt-To: your_email-address

Sometimes you will get a receipt back and sometimes you won't.  It
all depends on whether the receiving system honors your request, 
and nothing says it has to.  For now that's the best you can do.

Could someone please tell me why my messages disappear after posting them 
on a newsgroup.  It has been suggested that I could be set up to read 
only unread messages, but I don't think so because sometimes I go back and 
read messages that others have written. I need help to fix this because I 
cannot access any responses if I can't find the original message!! Thanks

Mavis.

Unless they have added functionality, I believe that Pine uses IMAP4 ONLY
for its remote reading.

If this is the case, then you will need to use a program (probably
popclient) to pull the remote news to the local server to be able to
reasonably use pine with it, or convince the appropriate admins to install
an IMAP server on your remote mail host.

Maybe I don't understand everythhing -- please answer, though ...

We have a domain gud.siemens.co.at and a local subdomain pseg.siemens.co.at.
So I have two HOMEs to run Pine, and for each I defined the appropriate of
the above mentioned domains.
When I send mails "into the Net", this makes no problems. But when I try to
address local users, their names are expanded to

<user>@pseg.siemens.co.at (e.g.),

but to reach a user, a host name is required! So such a mail goes nowhere ...

How can I force Pine to set the To: header with the host name, like

<user>@<host>.<domain> ?

The only way to reach local users seems to be addressing them with

<user>@<host>,

but in this case I do _not_ get the name expanded (from the passwd file) ...

I tried the smtp-server setting, with no effect. Is the only way to do this
setting the domain _with_ host name?
But in fact, <host>.gud.siemens.co.at is no _domain_ name  ...

I am a new user of pine on UNIX. Sorry if this has been already

message saying " VIEWER RESULT sh: hd: not found". Can somebody
pleaese tell me what is wrong and how I can view the attachment.

By the way, I have also tried ELM. I get the same message.

Inspect your ~/.mailcaps file: The attachment obviously has the mime-type
application/octet-stream and the standard viewer specification there is 
"hd". You can edit the line in the  ~/.mailcaps to call the wanted
command. (Do you know which data are in the mime-encoded attachment?)

It seems to be better the sender uses a mime-type for data-encoding
(see the ~/.mime.types file) which fits the content: image/gif, text/html ...

This is not Pine's task. Use procmail or elm to filter mail into separate
folders.

Thank you for the reply.

It was off.  But I tried toggling it a few times.  The result was the same.
When I enter PINE as my first application after I log on, it's inverse.  But 
after I exit PINE and run another application, then return to PINE, it's the
->.  My ISP just installed a new machine (SunOS 5.5.1).

POP3 support has been in there at least since version 3.91 (if not longer) -
I think, and it's definately still in version 3.95 (I use it).

{commercial-directory.com/pop3}INBOX 

...would work for him.  He _could_ use popclient (or fetchmail which has
replaced it), but he doesn't have to.

To whom it may concern:
I recieved a read only file and saved it to a directory, but am unable to
read it.  I am not sure how to access it.  When I go to about
attachattach, it says that it is unable to be accessed because it does not
know how to read the file. It is 48KB.  Also, it won't let me delete it.
HELP!!  How can I read it or delete it.  I don't even need to read it, I
just want to get rid of it.
Thank you,
Wendy Eisner

I think you are going to be out of luck here. If I remember correctly,
PC-Pine does not support POP, and there was a posting to this effect a
while ago from the Washington gurus. I just tried here with PC-Pine, with
the correct syntax, and it doesn't work, even though I know that I can
access my mail using POP from my home computer.

Yours

today was one of those nice days as the M$-crap installed in the
informatics service of our university showed again and repeadetly its
professionalism: it crashed.

Unfortunately it is the MTA for our offcial addresses
(Bruno.Boettcher@ensps.u-strasbg.fr unlike bboett@erm1.u-strasbg.fr which
is my SMTP address). This way, as often (the M$-MTA is VERY professional :)
mail send to poor M$-mail-(yes they exist)-users went lost, and i
have now to resend it....


and there lacks a functionality of pine, or i haven't found it yet:
in the saved folder there seems to be no 'resend' option, so at the moment
i am forwarding all the lots, making cut&paste with the mouse for the
addresses....

Does this function exist? if not will it be implemented? is there an easier
way to resend all the stuff?

 Hi,
 I have a really basic question. I use Unix pine all the time but got 
 curious about PC Pine and installed it today. I can't seem to get the 
 proper in-box path specified. In my pinerc file, I've specified that my 
 user id is tlange and my domain is concentric.net. The smtp server is 
 smtp.concentric.net. The NNTP server is news.concentric.net. I've tried 
 to set my inbox path to pop3.concentric.net and 
 pop3.concentric.net/tlange. Neither setting works. Oddly enough, I had an 
 easier time getting news folders set up. What am I doing wrong and what 
 do I need to set my in-box path to. Please post here and e-mail me at 
 tlange@netcom.com, which is where I get most of my e-mail for now until I 
 switch over completely to concentric.net. Thanks in advance.

I would add a custom header line saying "Reply-To: user@domain.com"
[inserting your name and domain] then all your replies go to the right
provider, it doesnt really matter the origin as long as your mail gets its
replies right.   [I use this procedure, and am totally happy with it]

Hello,

After a reboot there couldn't be any other mail session. Nevertheless
the message "INBOX (READONLY)" remains.

Where is that annoying flag?

HEllo all,
How do I find out how to configure IMAP for pine?
I tried getting some info from my computer by typeing man imap but no
response. The man pages for pine were not any help either.
I want to configure Imap to retrive my messages from my ISP instead of 
useing popclient that produces a blank message every other message.
Any help is appreciated.

Thank you,
Harry

Hello,

I'm using Pine 3.91 on a UNIX machine and NCSA Telnet 2.6 for the Mac.

I'm trying to print PostScript files using the ansiprn.c utility to 
deliver the output to my local printer.  My printer command option is set as:

	enscript -2 -p - | ansiprn

When I hit pr(y)nt everything seems to work.  Pine goes through its 
motions, a print selection window opens up on the desktop.  I hit return 
to send it on its way.

And the *source* of my postscript document arrives on the printer!

When I tried printing to a file, I discovered that somewhere along the 
line the postscript being produced by enscript was being fed as text into 
a second postscript file.  That is, I ended up with a postscript file of 
a postscript file of a mail message.

What's going on here, and can it be fixed?

There are tools (procmail) which can be used to filter incoming mail.
Setting it up depends on your system and you may need to contact local
support.

But, for this kind of case I recommend the following:


Your friend should

 (1) write a clear and unambiguous message to the
     person that she insists that he no longer send her mail. 

     It should be polite, but there must be no two ways of interperting
     it.

 (2) When that fails (it will, but it is a crucial step), she should tell
     him clearly and unambiguously that if he persists in this she will
     talk to the university's Email people (Postmaster).

 (3) If he continues you MUST follow up and talk to your email people.
     They may be willing to do things unofficially or they may insist
     on persuing matters in a way that may raise a stink.  My experience
     is that they will try a low-key quiet approach before taking further
     action.

I have seen cases where 1 and 2 worked.  And where on step 3 the
postmaster in agreement with the person getting the mail informally
approached the sender to make it quite clear that the recipient
really didn't want to get the messages.  I have never personally
seen a case go beyond that.

Hi guys,

I hope this reaches the right address... I didn't know where to send my 
question.

How do you *un*justify in pico?  Every time I hit CTRL-J, and hope for a 
particular justification, my paragraph "over-justifies" and I have to go 
back and manually edit it, a highly annoying venture.

I trust that someone will respond soon.,..

Frustrated,
MvW

Message-ID: <556cfk$202@news1.panix.com>

Hello all:

Over the past couple of days, I have lost all of the information in my
INBOX and saved-messages files.  They've literally gone from having,
respectfully, 5 and 21 messages in each, to going to 0 bytes.

And the really freaky thing is that I didn't do anything.

Particularly in the latter case, I'm perplexed.  Since, when the file
was revised to 0 bytes I was neither running an FTP (which would allow
me to replace the file), nor was I in Unix mode, I'd have had to have
deleted all 21 messages manually.

This I *know* I did not do.

My ISP claims ignorance.  They claim they didn't delete my messages (I
have no reason to doubt them on this), and they also claim that
they've never seen a "bug" of this kind in Pine.

So has anyone ever seen this kind of bug in Pine?   Particularly Pine
3.94?  Particularly Panix users?

Please reply to me at aem0608@is2.nyu.edu

E-mail is preferred, but public responses OK too.

Thanks,
Andrew Mathis

Pine 3.95 seems to have a logical error during reply if I say yes to

The different addresses arise because of forwarding of my mail from

 This happens with all messages, but there is no error if I say no to
reply to all recipients.

Does anyone know how to fix this problem?

Yeah, I've heard and tried that before, but you need to be somewhat of a
programmer to figure those out. It may not be Pine's task now, but it sure
would be helpful if it were made Pine's task at some point.

You were probably using 3.91 before.  Yes, everything is slower.  There is
a script, sendit.sh, which is included in the installation package.  You can 
specify in .pinerc option sendmail-path=.  We've found some improvement with
this, but still some serious slowdowns with a particular type of mail (1Mb
postscript files with very short lines).  You could try different sendmail 
options in that same place, or write your own program that might work better.

I hope this is helpful!

On http://www.rhein.de/~roland/pgppine/ you will find some filter
scripts to integrate PGP into pine.  Have fun with them :-)

Well, Pine's idea of deleted articles (in newsgroups) is the same as
tin and others' idea of read ones.

Therefore, if you have already read all articles using tin, you will
not see any articles from within pine.

To see already read articles in pine, press & for unexclude.

Similarly, if you want tin to know what articles you have read with
pine, you should use "D" to go to the next article when reading news
in pine. The article will not become invisible until you leave the
newsgroup or use eXclude explicitely.

If this still does not solve your problem, you might also check that pine
and tin are using the same news server, as otherwise their idea of which
articles the read article numbers in .newsrc refer to would be different.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Greetings,


When "signature is enabled" in the configuration menu, your prewritten 
message is appended to the the bottom when composing a message.This is a 
problem some times  when subscribing  to lists.  The server reads all of 
that extra text and rejects the subscription.  

My question is:
Can the signature b toggled on or off without going into the 
configuration menu?

Thanks in advance.

Fred

Thanks Bill, but I already know about the aliases file.  I have reasons, 
good ones I think, for not wanting to forward all of root's mail to my 
mailbox.  

For example, if I can't make it to the office or to a telnet connection, I 
want to be able to call in and ask someone else to check root's mailbox to 
see if there were any errors in the nightly backup, which get reported to 
root via email.  A person with limited root privileges (as configured under 
sudo), would be able to do this.  With your solution I would have to give 
the person my password so they could go into my mailbox to get the message, 
which I would rather not do.

Thanks for the response, but I'd still welcome a better one.

-Ken

Some newsgroups I lurk in occasionally have "jpegs" posted.  I assume 
they are graphics of some kind (I'm new to the world of technology).  
Is there any way I can view and or download to a disk these images?  
Obviously I'd need to view them before downloading them, to see what they 
are.  If I can't see them in Pine, is there a way to see them through 
Netscape?

I will appreciate assistance.  And please, explain it simply and 
clearly--I'm pretty dumb with computers.

To further narrow the problem, the error occurred when compiling "send.c".
I would appreciate suggestions.  Thanks.

Use ^K to delete it.  It should only be a few lines, so not much of a
problem.  (You can also mark it (ctrl-shft-^) and use ^K to delete it.)

While reading a uuencoded jpg, why not
|            !pipe 
uudecode     !send the post to be processed by uudecode program

This produces somefile.jpg in the default directory.

sz somefile.jpg      !use zmodem to download the graphic file
sz -u somefile.jpg   !use zmodem & delete file from account on successful dl

You'll still need a graphics viewer which you can easily find 
with a websearch.

Subject: Pine 3.95 + SunOS 4.1.3 start problem

Hi!

When trying to run pine 3.95, the following error message always occurs.

Can't access terminal or input is not a terminal. Redirection of
standard input is not allowed. For example "pine < file" doesn't work.


Researching the pine archives and docs yield no solution. Therefore, I'd
appreciate any comments from the pine community as to where I can look for
a resolution.

Our environment is SunOS 4.1.3 with VT-100 terminals and Sun workstations.
Pine appears to compile cleanly with gcc.

Thanks in advance -

I have a guess at what's causing the colors problem. It may be
that the UNIX system you're dialing into uses a different
terminal emulation. Try changing your HyperTerminal profile that
calls to your school to use a different terminal emulation.

Take five minutes to read this and it WILL change your life.
 
 The Internet has grown tremendously. It doubles in size every 4 months.
 think about it. You see those 'Make.Money.Fast' posts more and more.
 That's ... because it WORKS !  So I thought, all those new users might
 make it work. And I decided to try it out, a few months ago.  Besides,
 whats $5.00, I spend more than that in the morning on my way to work on
 coffee and cigs for the day. So I sent in my money and posted.
 Everyone was calling it a scam, but there are SO many new users from
 AOL, Netcom, etc. they will join in and make it work for you.

 Well, two weeks later, I began recieving bucks in the mail!  I couldn't
 believe it! Not just a little, I mean big bucks!  At first only a few
 hundred dollars, then a week later, a couple of thousand, then BOOM. By
 the end of the fourth week, I had recieved nearly $47,000.00. It came
 from all over the world. And every bit of it perfectly legal and on the
 up and up. I've been able to pay off all my bills and still had enough
 left over for a nice vacation for me and my family.

 Not only does it work for me, it works for other folks as well.  Markus
 Valppu says he made $57,883 in four weeks. Dave Manning claims he made
 $53,664 in the same amount of time. Dan Shepstone says it was only
 $17,000 for him. Do I know these folks? No, but when I read how they
 say they did it, it made sense to me. Enough sense that I'm taking a
 similar chance with $5 of my own bucks. Not a big chance, I admit--but
 one with incredible potential, because $5 is all anyone ever invests in
 this system. Period. That's all Markus, Dave, or Dan invested, yet
 their $5 netted them tens of thousands of dollars each, in a safe,
 legal, completely legitimate way. Here's how it works in 3 easy steps:

STEP 1.

Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate pieces
of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST." (In
this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone; you're paying for
a legitimate service.) Fold a $1 bill, money order, or bank note inside
each paper, and mail them by standard U. S. Mail to the following five
addresses:

 1-  Fern Suarez
     Mallorca 112
     Hato Rey, P.R., USA, 00917
 
 2-  Philippe
     2104 De Mexico
     Chomedey, Laval
     Quebec, Canada     
     H7M 3C6    
     
 3-  Natalie Jansen
     Lancveldlaan 18
     5671 CN Nuenen
     Holland
  
 4-  Chad Collier
     2785 Cold Springs Rd. #49
     Placerville, CA  95667  

 5-  Steve Boltinghouse
     1009 Bird St.
     Hannibal, MO  63401

STEP 2.

    Now remove the top name from the list, and move the
    other names up.This way, #5 becomes #4 and so on.
    Put your name in as the fifth one on the list.


STEP 3.

    Post the article to at least 250 newsgroups. There are at
    least 19000 newsgroups at any given moment in time.
    Try posting to as many newsgroups as you can. Remember
    the more groups you post to, the more people will see your
    article and send you cash!


STEP 4.

    You are now in business for yourself, and should start seeing
    returns within 7 to 14 days! Remember, the Internet is new
    and huge. There is no way you can lose.
 
    Now here is how and why this system works:
 
    Out of every block of 250 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.
 
    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 250
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings. On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!
 
    Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 250 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!
 
    Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.
 
    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

		The end result depends on you. You must follow through
		and repost this article everywhere you can think of.
		The more  postings you  make, the more cash ends up in
		your mailbox. It's too easy and too cheap to pass up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it. Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily. Try to keep
    an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

    If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
    for real, then don't do it. But please print this article and pass it
    along to someone you know who really needs the bucks, and see
    what happens.


    REMEMBER....HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.YOU DON'T
    NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE THE BUCKS!
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL, AND PLEASE PLAY FAIR AND YOU WILL
    WIN AND MAKE SOME REAL INSTANT FREE CASH!

*** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the bucks to the people
already included, you will not get much. I know someone who did this
and only got about $150 (and that's after two months). Then he sent
the 5 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had
over $10,000!

		TRY IT AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY!!!  :o) !!!!!!!!!!

Speed,
I'd really like to understand your comment... This capability has been in
all versions of Pine for *years*...

I have read the Pine readme, the FAQ, and the technical doc.  However,
I haven't been able to locate a description of where to specify during
configuration that I won't be installing things into /usr/local, so that
all the appropriate programs look in the right place for the help files, etc.
From looking at what is generated during the build execution, it appears that
via some flag notation I should be able to do this (boy, I sure wish configure
was being used - I know how to use that - and I don't even need to know 3
character machine/os names...) but I am not sure what the specific format
is.

Could someone send me an example?

Hi!

I want to use pine3.95 but do not have the c compiler on my server.
I've tried to download gcc installable-package from SCO skunware but 
the installation has failed.  Would someone please show me where I 
can obtain a pre-compiled binary file of Pine3.95 for SCO V?

Thanks in advance,
Duc.

Alas, that feature was introduced in Pine 3.92 at the earliest.

There are a couple of things that you can do, depending on what the 
recipient of the file will do with it on the other end. If you just want 
the recipient to view the text of the Word document, save the Word 
document as ASCII text, upload it to your Unix host, then use control-r  
to insert the text into your e-mail message. If you want the formatting 
to remain intact and the user will be using Word on the other end to 
view/manipulate the document in some way, then upload the Word document 
as is to your Unix host and send it across as an attached file. 
CHEERS!

Dear Sir/Madam,

First of all, I would like to thank you for the kind help you have always 
given to me.

There is one thing I want to make clear that why it occasionally happens 
that the same email was sent for several times, even after a few days of 
the first sending, for I do not think it is unnecessary.

I look forward to your answer.

Best wishes!

Thanks Bill! The terminal emulation mode was the answer to my second post
(screen was black on white).  I tried getting characters to return to
white on a black background and got black on white.  Black on white
appears under VT100.  Previously I had white on black background under
ANSI.  This changed to gray on black under ANSI using the new
HyperTerminal.  Since I changed back to ANSI it is still gray on black.  I
prefer the black background to reduce eye strain but find gray characters
don't produce enough contrast.  I'll just live with it until something
else happens.  Thanks Again,

It works fine here, so it is not a general problem with pine.

However, since it is the same character (^T) which doesn't work in
several situations, I suspect something is wrong with your terminal
program.

I had a similar problem once with a telnet program which insisted on
using ^O as the flushoutput character, so I couldn't postpone.
(I finally found out how to make a .telnetrc file which solved the
problem.)

Check the settings of your terminal program to see what characters it
uses for special purposes.

Ørjan.

Not so fast. For programs which run in xterms and take over the mouse
buttons, it is usually the case (perhaps even unavoidable) that you can
get the usual xterm cut-and-paste behavior by holding down the <shift>
key while you press the mouse button.

I believe that is all that is needed from within pine. However, you
also need to set up your terminal such that it transmits the
characters correctly.

In my .bashrc I have the following:

        export LC_CTYPE=iso_8859_1
if tty -s; then
        stty cs8 -istrip -parenb >&0
fi

In my .login for tcsh on another machine I have

stty -istrip
stty pass8
setenv LC_TYPE iso_8859_1

Which to use depends on your UNIX shell, and the exact syntax might
differ between UNIX versions.

The LC_TYPE is not necessary for pine but might be useful for other
programs.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

It already exists for x-windows.  Read PINE's online help for 
enable-mouse-in-xterm.  As for PC-PINE, I'm uncertain.

You can do pseudo-threading by selecting OrderedSubj under sort-key in
Setup/Config.  Will PINE actually create threads like Tin in future
versions?  I don't know, but it wouldn't be a bad feature, especially for
active Tin users since they are use to reading posts via threads.

Hmm .. With my window manager (olvwm), when I enable this feature, I can
select the message I want to read, with the mouse. If I double-click, It
automatically displays me the message. BUT I can't mark a few lines from the
message display and paste in another xterm. Are you able to do that ? How ?

Online Release Notes talks about the feature. And it appears to be available
only for X/Motif users ? (olvwm is OpenLook)

It is difficult to figure out, there doesn't seem to be much info in the
given documentation.  The best place to look is in the heavily
documented pinerc file. Anyhow, the key is the use of curly braces like
{} in your pinerc to designate an IMAP host.  Here are some lines from
mine (pine 3.94 on Linux 2.0.20):

inbox-path={mailhost.calvin.edu}INBOX

The natural place for filtering is between the mail transport agent
(e.g. sendmail, on most UNIX systems) and the mail user agent (pine).
I suppose you could have pine look into the mailbox and simply not
display, or actually delete, certain messages according to a killfile,
but that wouldn't be of much help if someone was mailbombing you.
Then you need something to keep the messages out of your mailbox
altogether.

A robust and full-featured mail filter is a nontrivial program; look
at the procmail distribution for example.  It would add a lot to the
size and complexity of pine to bundle something on that scale into
what is already a pretty big program.

I'd like to know how to include "rich text" (for example, bolding) in my
Pine-composed mail.  I'm using Pine 3.93 under Unix (Solaris 2.5).

Seems other people, when they (or their mail user agents) include HTML
tags in the body of their mail (<bold>Some text</bold>), Pine recognizes
this by means of the "Content-type: text/enriched" header, and displays
the bolding.  When I include bold tags in my mail, Pine doesn't want to
include "text/enriched," but rather chooses "text/plain."

Terry; I thing he (and many other users) just overlook the "O" (o)ther
command posibilities available.  PINE and PICO show 8 or 10 commands
available on the first screen and the 2 most important are (o)ther and (?)
for help.  Maybe one of the more usefull things you could do in future
releases mayhaps be to somehow highlight those features and or remind
users periodically that they are available.  IMHO it would cut down about
80% of the traffic in comp.mail.pine ... You may wish for example to post
a periodic reminder of this here.  I know the FAQ is available, and
archives are available of prior posts etc etc but your average user
doesn't seem to either know that or know how to access them.  Only a few
thoughts ... Hope this helps ... BYE

For all others; PINE has context sensitive help available, just press ? 
anywhere anytime in pine or ^g in pico (compose) ... That's it. I'm off my
soapbox now.  BYE.

Go into Setup/Config and put an X for enable-aggregate-command-set under
feature list if it isn't enabled already.  Then when you display the
articles (as well as your mail messages), hit the ';' character.  Then hit
the 'N' key, which will allow you to specify ranges.  Next, hit 'A' then
'D'.  That will delete the messages you selected.

If you want to get rid of ALL the articles or mail messages in one shot,
index the messages on your screen, then tap in this key sequence (it
doesn't matter where you are in the index):

;AAD (the two As are correct)

Looks weird, but that's how you do it.  HTH!

Yes, get procmail filtering (if you're on UNIX) and write the following
recipe.

:0
* ^From:.(email1@address.com|email2@address.com)
/dev/null

That will throw it into the trash.  You can put as many email addresses
these as you like.  You can also write scripts that will bounce it right
back to him with a message.

The bottom line is that you have to have procmail filtering or some other
mail filtering program.

Message-ID: <199611100703.KAA19478@softweyr.agropc.msk.su>

Has anyone solved such problem:

when I try to read in PC-Pine letter which contains characters with
codes 128-159 or 255 (decimal), they are not displayed properly.

This problem occurs after ISO_TO_CP translation in both DOS and Windows
versions of Pine.

It makes PC-Pine almost unusable for Russians, becouse in wide-spread
cyrillic encodings this symbols are frequently used. 

I suppose that it has something to do with output library, but have no
time to search for this place and patch it.
May be somebody have already solved this and can point me to source
routine or send a patch.

Another simular question: Is there any way (perhaps compile-time)
to disable QUOTED-PRINTABLE and Base64 encoding for cyrillic 
(i.e. texts, consisting of extended characters only). 

Lot of my correspondents use mail programs that are unable to handle MIME
and I'm tired of switching between pine and mailx on per recipient basis.

My site uses a Mail Transport Agent called exim, which includes fairly
sophisticated mail filtering.  This is not useful for the original
poster in this thread, but it is very good at cutting down on general
spam.

Exim is configurable to refuse SMTP connections from certain sites
completely, or it can reject mail from certain users/sites at the RCPT
level (ie it claims the recipient user doesn't exist, even if they
do).  Lastly it can silently trash mail from given sites.

Hi.
I'm a student using PINE in a UNIX environment.
Sometimes - most of the time - when I open PINE recently, I have no
messages in my inbox, whereas other mail readers do show messages. It even
happens that messages that were in my inbox during one session are not
there anymore when I use PINE another time.

The local staff cannot help me because they're not using PINE, even though
is on the network.

Can anyone help me?

Sacha

Change your password, then send a mail to yourself and see if the
mbox is still empty.

Good luck!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Help please.

We are attempting to move our mail off our overloaded UNIX box to our NT
server.  We are running Netscape Mailserver 2.0 on an NT 3.51 Server. 
Our unix box is a Sequent S81 running Dynix/PTX 2.1.6. Here is the
problem.

Not all of our users have access to netscape's mail client.  Some will
need to use Pine 3.91 to view the mail in their inbox.  Some time they
will also use Netscape 3.0 Mail Client to view the mail.

If I send a message and view it using Pine 3.91 to our POP3 Server... I
works!  If I send a message as view it using Netscape 3.0 mail client
WITH netscape set to DOWNLOAD the mail from to server to the local hard
drive... It WORKS!!

If I receive mail and view it using Netscape Mail Client set NOT do
download the mail, and then I go in to Pine 3.91, I can log into the
POP3 server.  It tells me that I have the correct number of message
waiting.  When I press 'I' to go into my inbox I get this...

	Bug in Pine detected: "Out of free storage".
	Exiting pine.

		Attempting to save debug file to /home/tomh/.pine-crash

	IOT trap

What gives?  Any Ideas?  We have enough free space on the drive.  I just
don't know whats going on.  I have attached the .pine-crash file for
those interested.

I will be eternaly grateful for help with this.


Thank You in advance...

I had the same problem.  So I *disabled* "enable-mouse-in-xterm."  I can't use
the pick-a-message, but I can cut and paste.  I guess it's one or the other,
not both.

I do not do much perl, but what you describe could be a problem of improper
quoting of args, or it might simply be a problem of not processing the args
with getopt or getopts, whichever perl uses.

This does not seem like a pine question, rather a problem with the script.

I cut and paste with a mouse all the time.  Solaris 2.X running xterms.

Get a real newsreader.  However I do not like real threading and am happy
with a real newsreader, nn, that does not do threading.

I am looking for a way to read and edit messages I have saved in PINE mail
folder files off line on my PC. I would like to download a mail folder
file and read and edit messages with either a DOS or Windows based
program. 

I would appreciate knowing which programs can be used for this purpose and
how to aquire them.

Thanks!

To Whom it May Concern,

I use pine with the megahertz system at the New Jersey Institute of

   However, since it is the same character (^T) which doesn't work in
   several situations, I suspect something is wrong with your terminal
   program.

   I had a similar problem once with a telnet program which insisted on
   using ^O as the flushoutput character, so I couldn't postpone.  (I
   finally found out how to make a .telnetrc file which solved the
   problem.)

Both cases could probably be addressed by pine's "fail-safe" alternate
escape sequences, in which a pair of Escape key presses replaces use of
the Ctrl key.  Thus, if ^T doesn't work, try Esc Esc t; if ^O doesn't
work try Esc Esc o.

Hope it helps,

Hi,

I just tried upgrading from pine 3.91 to 3.95 on my Linux (picasso) 
system (basically, just copied the binary into /usr/bin - saving the 3.91 
version, of course).

When I try to start 3.95, I get the message:

"Error creating /var/spool/mail/glenn.lock.847655022.12958.logoplex.com"

It doesn't stop me from viewing messages, but it is fairly annoying.  
More annoying is that I get a messagin when I try to send a message which 
tells me that it can't access sendmail (actually, I believe the message 
was something about being unable to pipe to sendmail...).  Obviously I've 
had to go back to 3.91 for now.

I never got this on 3.91 of pine.  I'm the "system administrator" of this
system, so I can't check with anyone else here.

Can you guys help me out?

Subject: Sending Pine address book between providers
Message-ID: <E0pqGv.Gov@world.std.com>
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 15:46:06 GMT

Hello, everyone.
 
I would like to take my .addressbook and .addressbook.lu files on one 
provider and send them to another.  The files were created with Pine 
3.95, but the system I'll be sending them to uses 3.93.  Will this 
transfer result in a usable address book on the destination system?
 
Thank you for all help.

Try setting the /usr/spool/mail directory to rwx by owner, group, and
others, and turn on the sticky bit (sorry, I forget the 'octal' number for
this permission).  I had the same problem - also with Pine 3.95 with Linux. 
I thought it was a new problem with Pine 3.95, but it turns out that 3.95
reports the problem that 3.91 ignored.

That'll probably take care of the sendmail problem too.

PS - You might want to run 'chown root.mail mail' just in case

Turn on enable-aggregate-command-set in Pine's setup|config, and from the
index of your inbox hit ;aad

; = select -> a = all
a = apply  -> d = delete

Subject: unable to delete message 0x7ee040 from inbox
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi Pine users,

I use Pine 3.91 on a VMS system and normally see the error message shown
in this message's subject line whenever I delete messages from my
inbox.  Actually, the error doesn't happen every single time I delete
messages but it does happen quite often.  Sometimes the '0x7ee040' is a
slightly different number which I assume to be something in
hexadecimal.  

Is anyone familiar with this error and could you suggest a fix to it ??

Also, a few days ago somebody sent me a message a few pages in length
and when I tried to "forward" the message to somebody else, pine crashed
out of the program.  The computer then displayed a message about an
'access violation' and other gobbly gook like register values and such. 
This error only seems to happen when I try to forward that particular
message!  Could the problem be with the message itself?  

Has anyone had Pine crash when trying to send or forward a message ??

Any help is greatly appreciated...

Sincerely,

 - oompah

Does anyone know if its possible to get messages from this list in
digest form?  Apparently the listserver doesn't understand the "set
digest" command.  

I like being on the list but it's a bit annoying always getting messages
from pine-info throughout the day.  

Anyone??

I would suggest using procmail (ftp from ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de) to
sort your incoming mail.

By doing so, all email messages for 'pine' can be sent to a separate
mailbox, so you won't be bothered by each message, but can stay on the
list.  Just open the mailbox once a day and read whatever messages have
come in...

I do this to stay on several mailing lists without being bothered by them.

BTW if your version of procmail is not procmai.3.11pre4, you should
upgrade.

This is determined by the assume-slow-link option. If set, then a '>'
will be used to save the number of characters transfered, but only
when you actually have a slow connection.

If you don't care about the speed drop, just unset it in Setup Config.

Have you really looked at the following man pages :
procmail (1)         - autonomous mail processor
procmailex (5)       - procmail rcfile examples
procmailrc (5)       - procmail rcfile
procmailsc (5)       - procmail weighted scoring techique

Especially procmailex is full of useful examples. It took only one hour or
two to read the documentation, to understand it (:-), and to write a
procmailrc. Here it does what you want it to do and it does it's work
flawlessly. BTW there is a mailing list for procmail questions.

A nasty problem.. The obvious thing to do now is to change alternate editor
for a time (why not try jed with ws emulation, it is not so far from joe).
If the problems then are gone - well, too bad for joe.

Another way, though requiring a little more effort, is to put your
signature in a file named something other than signature.

Then, when you want a signature, use ^r, and you'll get a prompt
for the filename.  This way, you can add the signature only
when desired (but without wading through the configuration menu
each time), and even have more than one signature (for different
occasions) by having different files.

I used to share my addressbook between Pine 3.91, PC-Pine 3.94, and PC-Pine

BTW, you do not need the file with the "lu" extension.  This is created and

I don't know if this was supposed to be funny or not,
but I don't think I've laughed this hard in a long
time.  Thanks, Glenn, for the levity in a (literally)

Subject: Moving Read Mail


We're using pine on a Sparc server with around 400 users and we'd like
to set the global default so that read messages are automatically moved
to SAVEDMAIL.  The trouble is that users leave their messages in INBOX
and our /var/spool/mail directory overflows.  The users can't be relied upon
to edit their own .pinerc files.

Is there some way of doing this globally?

Yes.... you will need to set up and configure a systemwide configuration
file for Pine.  This is typically called /usr/local/lib/pine.conf ... you
can get a template file by using the "-conf" option on the Pine command
line...

	pine -conf > pine.conf

and then editing the result.  (This option is described in the man page
for Pine.)

Note that any settings in this file can still be over-ridden by users in
their own preferences file.

However you can copy any settings you want to FORCE into place (so that
users can't override them) to a "fixed configuration file" 
(/usr/local/lib/pine.conf/fixed).

Date: 11 Nov 1996 14:56:47 GMT
Message-ID: <slrn58efg1.lim.vikas@joshua.insight.att.com>


This is a mailcap/MIME question but it concerns Pine so here goes.

o How do I view a text/HTML attachment in one of my mails in my Netscape
browser? Here is what I tried

 + Added the following line to my $HOME/.mime-types file
text/html                      html

 + Added the following line to my $HOME/.mailcap  file
text/html;netscape -remote 'openFile (%s)'

  I used the 'remote' option because I want it to display the HTML file in a
already running Netscape process. 

 Here is what happens when I say View Attachment in Pine:

It raises  up my Netscape window all right  but gives some error message
about 'Unable to open file....., etc.


Here is what shows in my Pine 'About Attachment' command about this attachment:

Details about Attachment #2 :
 
 
                Type            : Text
                Subtype         : HTML
                Encoding        : 7BIT
                Parameters      : CHARSET = us-ascii
                                  NAME = index.html
                Approx. Size    : 32,321 bytes
                Display Method  : "netscape -remote 'openFile (<datafile>)'"

So it is picking up my .mailcap entry but still does not work..

Got past the lock file messages, thanks to the help of nice folks here.  
Now, though, when I try to send a message using Pine 3.95, I'm still 
getting the message:

	"Pipe can't access Sendmail:  no such file or directory"

Rather annoying.  I don't see why 3.95 would have problems accessing 
sendmail when 3.91 doesn't seem to, but, then again, what do I know....

Any ideas would be most welcome.

Hmmmm.....  no further suggestions immediately spring to mind, I'm
afraid: our Pine seems quite happy with the following mailcap entry:

text/html; /usr/local/bin/netscape %s; \
        description="HTML document"

If I think of anything I'll let you know.

David,
 !!!!!!!!! This kind of response from  one of the authors of Pine :-)
:-)

 Yes, I understand that I can always do that. But since Pine is
supposed to adhere to RFC 1524, etc about MIME/mailcap compliance, I thought
I should be able to simply do a 'V' and 'Enter' to see my attachment insread
of saving it to a file.

 What you are asking me to do defeats the whole purpose of
attachments and mailcap files and MIME? 

Please tell me you have
looked at the code and have some suggestions as to why Pine is
thinking that '/var/tmp/tmp-....' is my file name and not actually
copying that file there....

 I mean, this looks like a bug in Pine's mailcap handling, right?

Yes, I am sure that what you have will work even for me.

But the point is that
I ****DONT**** want to start of another invocation of netscape 
whenever I view a HTML attachment. **HENCE** the netscape -remote
option....

Sorry for shouting. But I just got a response back from
David Miller@WASHINGTON.EDU, one of the authors of Pine and his
suggestion was 'Save the attachment to a file and 
then do netscape -remote 'openFile(<filename>)' !!!!
Sheesh... I knew that.. 

I think this is a simple bug in Pine that is being overlooked.

Thanks for your help,
--Vikas

Not sure about this but it sounds like you don't have a symbolic link from
/usr/sbin/sendmail to /usr/lib/sendmail.  I _think_ Pine looks for
/usr/lib/sendmail by default.

So, check if it's there and if not:

  ln -sf /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail

Try running "whereis sendmail" just in case you don't have the executable in
/usr/sbin.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Greetings fellow pine users,

At work I use Pine 3.91 and lately I've run into a few problems.  I've
posted a couple of questions to the list but unfortunately no one has
answered me yet.

One thing I've noticed is that my new email will show up in EITHER my
INBOX or my NEWMAIL folder.  There seems to be no pattern as to which
folder the new mail with go.  I think it probably has something to do
with possibly conflicting settings but I'm not sure.  I've read through
the descriptions of all the setting options but can't see why this is
happening.  Does anyone have a clue about this ?

Regards,

 oompah.

I can no longer use quotation marks and apostrophes in the e-mail I send -
the program does not recognize them. This affects my livelihood. I'm a
freelance journalist and use e-mail to file stories. My local
access provider - the greater new orleans freenet - did not have any
advice. What can I do? Is it the character settings? How can I alter them?
I use a Mac Performa 475. This occurs with files I export from a
word-processing program (ClarisWorks). Thanks for reading this.

    I have never had reason to do it, but I think you cancel articles
from Pine the way you cancel them from any other newsreader.  Send a
blank (no body) post to the newsgroup(s) involved with the Subject:

cmsg cancel <message-id>

where you have to know what the message-id is.  One caveat.  I have
heard (I have not verified) that you must post the cancellation from
exactly the same domain as the original posting you are trying to
cancel.

    Example: the generic domain of my address is  access.digex.net .
However, when I actually logon, my real physical address may be any
one of

        access1.digex.net
        access2.digex.net
        access4.digex.net
        access5.digex.net

If I were to try to cancel a news post, I would have to be logged on
to exactly the same host server that I was logged on to when I
submitted the original post I wanted to cancel.  For many people, of
course, this is simply not an issue, but for some it can be a gotcha.

    Since I have not had experience with cancelling news, I will
cheerfully accept corrections or amplifications.

Hmmm...  How about the permissions of /usr/sbin/sendmail?  Over here I have
it set to 104555 ( -r-sr-xr-x ), owned by user: root, group: bin.  ...and do
you have anything set in .pinerc under "sendmail-path=" ?

Make sure you've got curly-quotes (otherwise known as "smart" quotes) turned
off in ClarisWorks. They don't convert to regular " characters when you import
the file to a UNIX environment, and will either disappear or show up as 
control characters (Ms and Md, I think?). The option to turn off smart quotes
should be somewhere in the Preferences selection of the Edit menu, I b'lieve.

Cheers,
Mick

Here comes some more details:

computer is Sun Sparc Classic
and UNIX is Solaris 2.4

TERM=vt100
my stty -a settings are:

speed 38400 baud; 
eucw 1:0:0:0, scrw 1:0:0:0
intr = ^c; quit = ^|; erase = ^?; kill = ^u;
eof = ^d; eol = <undef>; eol2 = <undef>; swtch = <undef>;
start = ^q; stop = ^s; susp = ^z; dsusp = ^y;
rprnt = ^r; flush = ^o; werase = ^w; lnext = ^v;
-parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb -hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crtscts -parext

-tostop echoctl -echoprt echoke -defecho -flusho -pendin iexten 
opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel tab3

I am beginning to be quite sure that the problem comes with
my telnet-program or its settings.
I use NetTerm-program
Does anybody know what should the settings be ?

Mika

The easiest  way  to do this  (at least  on unix) is  a program called
"uuencode."  But, this way assumes  that the reciever has uudecode and
knows how to use it.

Anyone know if there's a "lynx-info" list out there?  I've checked for
newsgroups but there's nothing applicable.

Thanks!

Not exactly.  Most unix newsreaders have a cancel command.  It checks
the userid of the person running the newsreader and if it matches the
article to be cancelled, the newsreader composes the cancel article
by itself, sparing the user the details.

If only Pine's Delete command did this, and the articles were marked
read by reading them, it would be like "any other newsreader".

The "Control: cancel" line should be enough but you may want to include the
"Subject: cmsg cancel" for compatibility.

I already mailed this to the list -- the problem persists:
I wanted to test the "automatically send back" feature from the procmailex
man pages, but it doesn't work at all.

First, see my .procmailrc:
=====
# A sample small $HOME/.procmailrc from the procmail(1) man pages
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/vue/bin:/users/ohrt/bin:/users/ohrt/usr/bin
MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
# DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/mbox/default   -- completely optional
LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/from   #recommended
VERBOSE=yes

:0:
* ^TOpine-info
PineInfo

:0:
* ^Subject:.*ProcmailLock
lockTest


:0
* ^From +burg
burgMail

:0 chb
* !^From +ohrt
* !^Subject:.*Re:
* !^FROM_DAEMON
* ^Subject:.*retrieve
| (formail -r ; echo "AUTOANSWERED\n" ; cat $MAILDIR/info_file) | $SENDMAIL -oitrue -t

:0
* ^Subject:.*Flame
/dev/null
=====

-- and the .forward:

"|IFS=' '&&p=/users/ohrt/usr/bin/procmail&&test -f $p&&exec $p -Yf-||exit 75 #ohrt"
=====

Compared to actual .procmailrc, I made these changes:

* ^From:.*burg
[...]
:0 chb
* !^Subject:.*Re:
* !^FROM_DAEMON
* ^Subject:.*retrieve
[...]

Then I tried:

1) mailx -s "retrieve" ohrt

a) as user "burg" (on the same host)

result:
   - "burg" gets a reply, but without the "info_file".
   - _no_entry_ in the log file ("from" in .procmailrc)
   - _no_entry_ in burgMail, as suggested by .procmailrc

b) as myself, user "ohrt"

result:
   - I get the "info_file".
   - log file:
   [...]
procmail: Match on "^Subject:.*retrieve"
procmail: Executing " (formail -r ; echo "AUTOANSWERED\n" ; cat $MAILDIR/info_file) | $SENDMAIL -oitrue -t"
   [...]

2) mailx -s "nosub" ohrt
a) "burg": as 1)a)
b) "ohrt":
   [...]
procmail: Match on ! "^Subject:.*Re:"
procmail: Match on ! "(^(Precedence:.*(junk|bulk|[...]
   [...]
procmail: No match on "^Subject:.*retrieve"
   [...]

3) in .procmailrc: changed line to
* ^From +burg

mailx -s "retrieve" ohrt
a) "burg": as 1)a)
b) "ohrt": as 1)b)

mailx -s "nosub" ohrt
same as 2)


Original .procmailrc, i.e.:

:0 chb
* !^From +ohrt
* !^Subject:.*Re:
* !^FROM_DAEMON
* ^Subject:.*retrieve

1) "burg": same as above
2) as myself: just "No match on ..." -- so, no action ...

Well, after one day of experimenting it seems that I DO NOT GET ANY MAIL from
anybody into my mailbox, except from me ...
What am I doing wrong?
Do I have to define any default target? According to the man pages, this is
superfluous ("completely optional") ...

Please help ...

Cheers,
Diti

    Pine as such will not help you.  It does not do any preprocessing
of incoming mail.  However, there are tools which will do the job ahead
of Pine, provided you have a reliable method for identifying the mail
you want to trash-can.  You mentioned Elm.  Well, as I understand it,
Elm's filter program can be used standalone to filter out unwanted mail
before Pine opens it.  On Un*x systems, procmail is also widely used
for mail filtering.  Nancy McGough as a lot of good material online
about mail filtering.  I never remember the URL, but I have a link to
it.  If you have a WWW browser, browse my home page and follow the
links to Nancy's good stuff.

    By the way, I strongly recommend AGAINST bouncing spam and junk
mail back to the sender.  It may not do any good, anyway, if the sender
is also prefiltering incoming mail, and it just adds to congestion on
the networks.  Either trash it outright, or complain to the sender's
postmaster.

The Return-Receipt-To: header works fine, given the receiving system
supports returning receipts. I have a question connected with this header.
When I move to cursor into the To:, Cc:, Bcc:, etc. header lines, a menu
choice of ^T - Go to addressbook is offered. This is not so for the
Return-Receipt-To: line. Since I don't want to jam email systems with
receipts, I only add my address to this header line in cases when I REALLY
want a receipt. I'd like to add just the nickname which I defined for
myself, but obviously this cannot be done w/o the ^T To addrbook option.
Or can it?

Thanks,
    -  Hans

I think Mike make a slight, but important typo.

That path should be /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed

The quickest way would be to load up $HOME/.netrc with your favorite text
editor and to remove them there.

    I am wondering if any other Un*x Pine users have experienced
anything like this.

    I use Pine 3.94 under SunOS 4.1.4 with a DOS PC emulating a VT100
dialed into a shell account (C shell) via ProComm Plus v2/DOS.  In
place of the built-in Pine composer, I have specified as my alternate
editor (implicitly) JOE v2.8.

    From time to time, when I go to reply to either mail or news, I get
a session hang.  I will fill out the headers and then move down into
the message body.  Pine generates the file on /tmp and invokes JOE. 
However, at seemingly random intervals -- I have not been able to
detect a pattern -- as soon as JOE is entered everything locks up tight. 
The only way out I have been able to find is simply to hang up the
connection and log back in again, a bit clumsy to say the least.

    These sessions lockups seemingly at random started all at once a
couple of months ago.  I have not myself changed the level of any of my
software or made any configuration changes in any programs..  Before I
rattle the cage of my ISP, I was just wondering if any other Pine users
were experiencing similar problems.  The lockup always occurs precisely
when the alternate editor is entered.

    uuencode may certainly be used to send an executable through the
mail -- I have done that myself -- but that is not what the original
inquiry was about.  uuencode does not "launch" the executable: it just
sits there, so to speak, waiting for the recipient to do something with
it.  Getting an executable to begin execution automatically when a
recipient reads mail is an unbelievably awful notion that makes me
shudder even to think about it.  Fortunately, there is no blanket way
to accomplish it, with Pine or any other mailer, that I know of, and
uuencode has nothing to do with what the original writer was asking
about.

  I tried it. But unfortunately the editor is opening it as a new file.

  Thanks again.

 There is in fact an easy way to do it with elm (and a similar way to do
it with pine, but AFAIK pine must be specifically compiled to allow
changing your address).
I'll give an exaple of how I do it with elm:
On the machine I normally use elm on, lorenz.physik.tu-berlin.de, I have
the login name schwarz, so my "generic" address would be
schwarz@lorenz.physik.tu-berlin.de. I do prefer however to use the address
schwarz@physik.tu-berlin.de, so I created the file ~/.elm/elmheaders and
put in the following line:

  From: Georg Schwarz <schwarz@physik.tu-berlin.de>

I also put in

  Reply-To: schwarz@physik.tu-berlin.de

but that should not be necessary. The same way you can add other header
lines like Organziation and so on. BTW, you can do similar things with nn
and probably most other newsreaders as well.

    Well, it all depends on information which you did not provide. 
There are so many combinations and possibilities in the universe that
there simply is no single answer.  If the mail is addressed to a system
running some kind of Un*x and if procmail is available on that system,
then you can do what you want to do with procmail.  There are other
possible solutions depending on what your setup is.  As such, your
inquiry has nothing to do with Pine, which will not do what you want. 
(It was never designed to.)

Be careful opening attached .doc's in Word, f'r instance ... isn't that
the macro-viruses' route? Takes more than pine, true. Eudora, now, I'd
keep a close eye on that one.

I use Pine to read mail and news.  The news I read comes from 2 servers,
with some newsgroups being available on one but not the other.

I want to be able to only show the newsgroups which are actually available
on the appropriate servers, when I run Pine.

For example, I use the servers news.cowan.edu.au and
echidna.stu.cowan.edu.au

Now, "outside" newsgroups are only available on news.cowan..., so a group
like comp.lang.pascal.delphi.components.usage would be found there.  The
other server contains local groups like cowan.extstudies.exams

When I go to my news collections, I don't want to go to the list for
news.cowan... and be offered newsgroups that don't exist there.  Someday I
will forget, and try to pick a group that isn't on that server, and
problems will arise.

Is there anything I can do to solve this problem?

I'd settle for only seeing crossposts the first time I read them.

Even if they're not spam.

MIME-Version: 1.0

While running a moderated list on majordomo, majordomo sends all messages
directed to the list to a Pine user which contain both the majordomo
message and bounced message. However, Pine interprets majordomo's message
as two seperate messages, when in fact it should just be one message--this
must be because majordomo includes the headers for its bounced message
and Pine interprets that as two different messages. It
seems Pine doesn't notice the Content Length header in the majordomo
headers. I've looked for a possible configuration option in Pine to
correct this but have come up empty.

Is there any way to correct this problem? Thanks.

The first and most obvious suggestion is:
	Don't use NFS to access mail over the net, use IMAP instead.
	That's what IMAP is for.

The problem is in file locking.  It doesn't work over NFS -- or rather, it
doesn't work reliably.  Pine has a test to see if a file is NFS and if so
it avoids doing file locking.  My guess is that HPUX 10.10 breaks that
test; probably the same way that Solaris 2.5 does. 

You'll be interested to know that SUN swears on a stack of bibles that
they have fixed NFS file locking so it's just like local files, and thus
it doesn't matter that they broke Pine's test.  You can see for yourself
how well they "fixed" it.

You'll find IMAP to perform much better than NFS, and you won't have these
locking problems.

You can have more than one address in the .forward file, separated by
commas, so put your school username there too, but prepended by "\", e.g.

\butch, butch@home.address

The "\" prevents the mail program from trying to use the .forward file
again and going into an infinite loop..

For more about forwarding do a "man 5 forward" from the UNIX prompt.
(Chapter 5 in the manual pages is about file formats.)

Hello,

Can any please tell me what is procmail? Does it help in filtering 
messages to respective folders? Where will I get more information?

Thanks, Dinesh.

Subject: Pine 4.0
Date: 11 Nov 1996 09:01:10 -0500
Message-ID: <567bj6$fmq@news.duke.edu>

I've noticed that some articles posted to this news group make reference to
pine 4.0. I'm curious. What's the timetable for the release of pine 4.0? Is 
information specific to pine 4.0 available? If so, where? 

Note: I checked URL <http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine> but didn't find 
anything specific to 4.0.

TIA,
Steven McElwee

Steven,
We don't have a timetable for release of 4.0 yet.
Note however that there will not be very many new features in 4.0.
Support for folder hierarchies is the main one.

The primary objective is to adapt Pine to the latest "c-client" libraries
that implement IMAP4rev1.  This will provide a foundation for adding some
new features later on that require IMAP4, such as disconnected operation.

Also, if you set the user-domain in your pine setup, this will be used to
complete your address -- and there's also the feature use-domain-only (or
similar). But it is always a good idea to set the "Reply-To:" header.

Yes, procmail is applicable to you if you use Un*x. Get the package from
your nearest USENET comp.sources.misc or at ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de as
pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

Hope,it helps

Yes, it looks like this:

personal-name=Joachim Schaaf
user-domain=pu.nz.fh-koeln.de

The problem is, that the personal-name is not the username (user@host).

    I am not aware of any way to do this, but even if there were, it is
an extremely bad idea.  It is far worse than the desire of some people
to put control characters in an email to cause special visual effects on
the recipient's terminal, which is already a bad idea.

    Go into your configuration screens and read the online help
information about aggregate commands.  (There may be something about
aggregate commands in the Help off the Main Menu, although I haven't
looked at that in a while.  It certainly never hurts to read it,
though.)

I have seen a similar effect when sending a mail to my provider's "mirror"
address. Mirror sends back a mail with the original mail in the body.
Therefore 2 From lines exist, and pine gets the mail as 2 mails. Since I
use procmail to filter all my incoming mail this effect vanishes.

Add the name of your local news server (a quick check reveals that
'news.ecn.bgu.edu' exists, try that) in
Setup Config nntp-server.

Also set the enable-8bit-nntp-posting option.

Then quit and restart pine; you should now have a newsgroups folder
collection.

Use 'A' in the collection to subscribe to newsgroups.

Greetings,
Ørjan Johansen.

	Not so!  I am using PINE 3.90 (unix), and it IS available on our

You need to change two variables in pine/osdep/os-xxx.h (whichever xxx 
corresponds to your system):

SYSTEM_PINERC and SYSTEM_PINERC_FIXED should be changed to the location of
the system-wide pine.conf files.

Other than that the executables are self contained and once you build them,
you should be able to move them anywhere and they'll work (providing libc.so.1
and libdl.so.1 are in the same place as where you built it).  If they are
not, changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH is probably the easiest way around it.

I hope this helps!

I assume you are using Pine on a VMS machine (using login.com file).  You
can do these:

1. Edit a file (e.g. sig4pine.txt) in your login level, save it.

2. Add nothing in login.com.

3. In Pine (we have 3.91, but others should be same ... :-), do "s" 
   and "c" to setup configurations.  Go down to the "Signature file"
   line, and do an "a" to add value.  Enter "sig4pine.txt" as the
   value.  Do "e" to exit configuration and confirm the changes if
   necessary (3.92 or newer versions).

That's all.

Message-ID: <567l53$pbc@mufasa.harvard.edu>

A while ago I wrote about upgrading pine to v 3.95 on our Sun (SunOS
4.1).  At the time I had the problem of a read-only INBOX which was
fixed by following the suggestion of Mark Crispin, who wrote:

> Second thing to try: as root, do: rm /tmp/.*

Thanks Mark!

Now I've installed pine for other users, and one of them just reported
the same problem.  I looked in /tmp, but *none* of the files there
were owned by him.  I noticed two old files, something like

----------   1 foo      cell           5 Nov  5 11:34 .706.11d33
----------   1 bar      cell           5 Nov  5 12:26 .706.11c06

which appeared to have come from old pine sessions.  After deleting
these, the user in question was able to open his INBOX properly.

How is it that a pre-existing file not owned by a user is able to
affect that user's ability to properly open a mailbox lock?

    You are correct: Pine cannot do this.  Pine does not do any
preprocessing of news or mail.  Some day it may, but some day is not
here.  However, Pine makes use of the same .newsrc file (on Un*x) that
other newsreaders do, so it is possible to fake your way around the
situation if one of those newsreaders is also installed on your system.

    For example, I follow a couple of newsgroups which -- sigh! -- get
a lot of heavy crossposting.  I run trn in a sort of batch mode with a
script which uses trn killfiles to update my .newsrc so that when I
start Pine, I only see a crosspost in one newsgroup and not the other. 
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than nothing.  (I kill on some
othe criteria, as well.)

    As for spam, the technique will work provided you have a reliable
way of identifying spam at all so that you can put it in a killfile. 
You also have to have another newsreader available and learn a minimal
amount about it.

    Lack of killfiles, many people think, is one of Pine's biggest
functional shortcomings.  I agree.

Occasionally when I try to read news from our news server which is a
remote machine I run into a problem.  If the news server is down for some
reason or a connection cannot be made PINE seems to lock up at least until
the connection attempt times out.  Is there some way to cancel such a
command should I experience a delay without having to just wait for Pine
to give up trying? I'm sure there must be something I'm overlooking.

:     Depending on how current your version of Pine is, you can do one

: recipient addresses (using a nickname, if you have one) in the Bcc:
: header field.  In that case, _be_sure_ to put *something* in the To:

: header field.  Both of these should be amply explained in the online
: help.  (Use ^R to get "Rich Headers" if you need to in order to use
: these fields.)

As a follow up on this topic, is it perfectly legal & ethical to
supress the recipients address in a mailing list.

I would like to know what others think.

You aren't serious, are you?

A virus that comes across an email message?  Really?  How does it  
execute?  Hmm?

The "Good Times" virus was a hoax, and the same tired old plot now  
lives on with "Irina".

Plain and simple: if you don't run the program, it can't touch your  
system.  If someone mails you an executable, don't run it.

Simply downloading your email will do nothing.

We are rutgers have  3.95, and there is no  w at the bottom.  However,
if you do what was suggested, you will  get another menu.  The rest is
self explanatory.

	I know that at some universities, such as Tulane -where the Kermit
system is used- students are able to receive graphics through the use of
Netscape Navigator.  I have used this program this past summer, when a
friend of mine had a student account there.  
	I would like to know if Pine had the same type of program where I,
as a student with a Pine account, can link the Netscape Navigator program
to my student account and receive graphics.
	If there is such a way, and I believe our library uses this
method, will you please send that information here, so that I can use the
Netscape Navigator in conjuction with pine to get graphics.
	If there is no way for indevidual students to use this technology,
I would like to suggest that Pine model itself more after the highly
successfull Kermit system.
		Thank you,

To get the bcc: option, while in the header part of your new composition 
(where the to: line is, for instance) do ctrl-R .

Is it possible to 'delete' a spam in one newsgroup and have it automatically
deleted from the other newsgroups to which you are suscribed?

I know several dedicated newsreaders offer this feature, but as far as I
know Pine [1] can't do it (yet!).

Would it also be possible in future versions of Pine to have a feature which
allows you to 'delete' any articles in a newsgroup that have been spammed to
at least x other newsgroups?

Message-ID: <56cga6$nlt@news.fsu.edu>

Sometimes I wish to cancel an article I have posted. This is easy
using rn with the C command. However, I see no way to do that in
pine. Worse still, when I go to an article I have posted from pine, rn
thinks I did not post it and will not let me cancel. It seems to think
I am another poster.

Any way around this?

Does pine 3.95 currently support news authentication?  And if not, is this

Be aware that this won't work at many sites that use sendmail.
Sendmail is typically configured to overwrite the From: header.

The lock files on /tmp control locking between multiple copies of Pine or
imapd (as opposed to the .lock files which control locking with sendmail).
The /tmp lock files are assigned a name based upon the device and inode
number of the file (to handle the case of hard links).  This wouldn't have
to be done if UNIX had real locking, but UNIX doesn't.

A lock file with protection 000 (as in your example) is a bug.  That
should not happen in current versions of Pine, although some older
versions of Pine had this problem.  Were the files really from Nov 5, or
were they much older?  Does your system clear /tmp as part of its reboot
procedure (it should)?

I don't know anything about the system you are running Pine and Lynx on, but
over here under Linux, I'm running gpm.  I've never tried it, but I'm sure
you could cut & paste text from Pine on one console to Lynx on another.

Does anyone know what Pine does when it replies to a newsgroup message?  
Does it send mail to the poster and post to the newsgroup, or just post?  
Thanks very much.

I'd like to know about this, too.  I'm pretty sure there is no way to 
interrupt Pine once it gets going with a task.

I'd like to suggest that this would make a great new feature for the next 
version of Pine.  Netscape has a "stop" button.  Lynx has control-g.  
Pine needs some sort of keystroke that will interrupt searches, sorting 
operations, and remote folder lookups in the event that these types of 
activities take too long.

 Thanks for the information.

 Let me explain the setup I use. I am using a DOS based PC system to call 
up at the ISP. As far as I know, they too are not aware of procmail. They 
are using a UNIX system. I access Pine and Lynx which is resident on the 
ISP's hard disk. How can I still use procmail? What changes will have the 
ISP do? Or can I do them for myself? I have access to the shell prompt.

 Dinesh.

Hello,
At the selection of folders, when I am trying to expand the list of 
newsgroups, I am getting the following message -

 400 - No Space left on device writing article file - throttling.

The message would not go off even after re-selecting the newsgroup 
folder.I am unable to access the Newsgroups. What should I do?

Thanks.

Dinesh.

Hello,

A suggestion regarding filtering.

I understand that Pine does not have any inbuilt feature to filter 
messages as it does not know how mails are delivered on different systems.
But is it not possible to write a function whereby which the filtering 
takes place after the messages are delivered in the INBOX?
What I mean is, after the messages are received and stored in the INBOX 
folder, Pine can take over. Either we can have an option to do it 
automatically or manual, by a particular key press.

Dinesh.

Did you select the "attached-to-ascii" printer?  From the main menu, 
press S for Setup, then P for printer, and then read the instructions.  If 
you have not done this, you may be printing on a network printer somewhere.

I have the following setup:
   mail spool on an HPUX9.05 machine
   client machine is HPUX10.10

The mail spooler is NFS mounted by the client machine.
When I try to read mail from the client machine, pine
hangs -- won't even give me the index of mail messages.

On the server machine I get an "RPC_UNKNOWNHOST message in
the rpc.lockd.log file.  

This all works fine if I use elm on the client machine.

Anyone have any ideas? (besides switching to elm......)

Yes, Pine 3.95 does support "Authinfo" authentication to News Servers.  It
works for those servers that allow you to read freely but not post until
you've authenticated, and also for those that require yo uto authenticate
before even allowing you to read (eg, INN 1.4unoff3 onwards).

Cheers,

You should contact your local help desk for assistance.

The message is coming from the Usenet News server software itself (Pine is
merely relaying it to you).  The message means that the News server's disk
is full.

Rick,
 Thanks for responding. I had already tried what you suggested but after
a few mails with David Miller (one of the Pine authors), here is what my
problem was;
  My 'netscape' was not the ACTUAL executable but a shell script wrapper
written by our sys-admins which did some house-keeping and and then invoked
the actual netscape. But Pine launches it like this
 (netscape -remote .... ; rm /var/tmp/<myfile>)

So, you see, by the time the actual netscape is invoked, the file is GONE :)

Duh.. I felt quite foolish at how trivial the solution turned out to be i.e.
calling the actual netscape executable from my mailcap file :)




Thanks,
--Vikas

I have a sneaky solution to your problem which makes use of the format
of your newsrc file.

o Go to the .newsrc file in your home directory. By default, it is
  $HOME/.newsrc
o Load it up into any editor.
o Change all the ':' characters in the file to '!' characters..
o That's it. You are done....


Hope it helps,

Do the following: 

+ Add the following to your $HOME/.mailcap file.
#######################
# HTML document
text/html;/usr/local/add-on/netscape/netscape -remote "openFile(%s)" || /usr/local/add-on/netscape/netscape %s ; x-mozilla-flags=internal; description="HTML document"
#######################

+ Add the following to your $HOME/.mime.types file
#######################
text/html                      html \ \
type=text/html  \
exts="html,\" 
type=text/html  \
exts="html" 
#######################

And voila, you should be up and running. Let me know if you have any
problems,

HTH,

If you have this set and you reply to a message with an attachment,
the attachment is included in the reply -- as an attachment, not as
part of the edit buffer, even if the original attachment was
text/plain. So thanks for the suggestion, but this doesn't do what I
have in mind.

I use a news server (news.zippo.com) that requires authorization to login.
Because of the high overhead of tin , i decided to use pine.  Is there
anyway to specify a password/login/newsserver combo with pine? Will it
read the .newsauth file that tin uses?

Thanks

Occasionally when I try to read news from our news server which is a
remote machine I run into a problem.  If the news server is down for some
reason or a connection cannot be made PINE seems to lock up at least until
the connection attempt times out.  Is there some way to cancel such a
command should I experience a delay without having to just wait for Pine
to give up trying? I'm sure there must be something I'm overlooking.

Pine 3.95  supports news authentication ("authinfo user/pass"); earlier
versions do not.

It does not makes use of the .newsauth file; you must enter your username
and password manually when prompted to do so.

Cheers,

Subject: Confession At Gun-Point By Mark J. Christie

Mother! Please don't shoot! I'll confess! I'll confess! (Mark J. Christie's
mother is pointing a gun at his head and threatening to blow off his brain
if he does not come clean). Please forgive me Steven Esau (Steven is the
general counsel of Asymetrix Corporation, USA <stevene@asymetrix.com>), my
mom will be visiting you later. This is what happened and I emphasize this
is the absolute truth.

***The Objective - Get Jeffrey Tay's software called KaiZenWare
Jeffrey Tay created a multimedia authoring tool called KaiZenWare in 1993.
However, he has not released it for a variety of reasons. This year (1996)
we came to know about it and wanted to get hold of KaiZenWare but we did not
succeed. He found a company interested in marketing his software but we
sabotaged him by telling that company that KaiZenWare violates Asymetrix's
copyright without even seeing KaiZenWare (remember he refused to let go of
his software). Details of this can be found at:
http://www.ets.bris.ac.uk/comments/21612.htm.

The question is: How to get hold of Jeffrey's Tay software called
KaiZenWare? We hatched out a plot to lure him to release his software called
KaiZenWare. This is how the plot works:

Stage 1 we gave him a letter from Steven Esau, general counsel of
Asymetrix Corporation, USA <stevene@asymetrix.com> which authorized him
to distribute his software called KaiZenWare.

Stage 2 we waited for him to fall for our trap. He started marketing his
software called KaiZenWare on the Internet in Aug 1996 and we proceeded
to download a copy for our own reference so that we can copy his ideas.

Stage 3 whenever someone enquired about KaiZenWare we will tell them that
it is illegal (members of the ToolBook mailing list have been told in Aug
1996 that it is illegal) and we refuse to acknowledge the fact that
KaiZenWare is an exception and that Steven Esau has indeed sent Jeffrey
Tay a letter to authorize the distribution of KaiZenWare.

Stage 4 we keep totally quiet about this dual-reality. Jeffrey Tay is the
only one who knows of the letter from Steven Esau. Jeffrey Tay does not
know that members of the ToolBook mailing list thinks it is illegal.
Jeffrey Tay does not know that we spread words that it is illegal.

Stage 5 we will carry on this charade and will ensure that nobody buys
KaiZenWare because they think it is illegal. Jeffrey Tay can spend the
rest of his life wasting time and money marketing KaiZenWare but nobody
will buy because they think it is illegal.

Unfortunately, Jeffrey Tay found out and complained to members of the
ToolBook mailing list. Our good friend who owns the list speedily
arranged to forbid Jeffrey Tay from posting articles to members of this
list even though he has just subscribed to the list.

The idea is to gag Jeffrey Tay and to let everyone else say bad things
about KaiZenWare and Jeffrey Tay and ensuring that Jeffrey Tay does not
have a chance to ask questions and answer questions.

Is this cruel? This is the world of business and it is necessarily dirty
and cruel. I have no sympathy for Jeffrey Tay because I also want to copy
his ideas. I also want to make lots of money. Who cares about Jeffrey Tay
even though his software called KaiZenWare was developed and tested in
1993? Jeffrey Tay's job is to prove that his software is good and then
our job is to steal his idea and prevent him from selling KaiZenWare by
sabotaging him secretly.

Please broadcast this message to everyone on the Internet. Jeffrey Tay is
a one-man show working from home and he needs all the help he can get.
Steven Esau has to answer one question: Did he send a letter to Jeffrey
Tay authorizing Jeffrey Tay to distribute KaiZenWare?

Thank you.

P.S. To find out about KaiZenWare, use Excite and HotBot and use
"kaizenware" as the keyword to search the database.

If you set up the nntp-host, but have no news collection then all
should be exactly they way that you want it.

I believe that it can be done, but I have to admit that I haven't tested.

If it doesn't work, you could always try to force the news-collection
to something like /dev/null.

Subject: Confession At Gun-Point By Steven Esau

Mark J. Christie's mother visited me last night. Suddenly, she whipped out a
gun and shoved it right into my mouth! She said: "Asshole, I don't like
lawyers! They can't be trusted and you sure have no shit conscience lying
and hurting an innocent young man. Do you remember Jeffrey Tay from
Singapore? (Steven pretends he does not know and Mark J. Christie's mother
thrusted the gun deeper down his throat!) As always, the coward finally
confessed (after wetting his pants!). This is Steven Esau's confession:

1. I did send Jeffrey Tay a letter authorizing him to distribute KaiZenWare.

2. I did not announce it to anyone. The idea is to make sure that only
Jeffrey Tay knows of the existence of the letter and nobody else needs to know. 

3. When those folks at the ToolBook mailing list was discussing about
KaiZenWare and about creating authoring tools using Asymetrix ToolBook, I
simply kept quiet. Everyone had the impression that KaiZenWare was illegal.
I didn't tell them that I have sent Jeffrey Tay a letter to authorize him to
distribute KaiZenWare because I don't want anyone to know that KaiZenWare is
an exception.

4. When he found out and joined the ToolBook mailing list, I simply refused
to answer. Everyone on the ToolBook mailing list still thinks that
KaiZenWare is illegal because we will never admit that we sent Jeffrey Tay a
letter to authorize him to distribute KaiZenWare.

Mark J. Christie's mother will be staying with me for the next few days. She
said she does not trust lawyers and will hold me hostage to punish me. She
specifically forbid me to change my pants because she wants that "thing" to
rot and itch.

Mark J. Christie's mother revealed that she spoke to Jeffrey Tay over the
phone. She managed to persuade Jeffrey Tay to let everyone on earth use his
software for FREE. Of course, voluntary donations will be appreciated. For
those who want Jeffrey Tay to create a version of KaiZenWare to run on
ToolBook 3, 4 or ToolBook II runtime, please send him a copy of your
software and he will upgrade KaiZenWare for you for FREE. Please contact him
in advance before you send your software to him. 

To find out more about KaiZenWare, use Excite and HotBot and use
"kaizenware" as the keyword to search the database.

Thank you.
P.S. I am starting to itch in the you know where. Funny, my tongue kept
snaking around the barrel of the gun; I think I am beginning to enjoy it!
(the gun is still inside his mouth).

Hello,

Can anyone please tell me as to how is it possible to send a single mail 
to all members of a paticular address book?

How can one send a single mail to other using cc? Does it mean that I 
have to type in each and every address every time to send mail? Or is 
there a shortcut?

Thanks for the help.

Dinesh.

The README file says how to install it.  It is designed to be plug and
play; just install it and that's it.

Nothing.  Don't use imapd.conf.  You will just shoot yourself in the foot.

The mere existance of a configuration file capability doesn't mean you
have to use it.

Are you interested in funding such a project?  I'm serious.  Documentation
takes a huge amount of time and effort.

Richard,

I didn't see your original post but it seems you are looking for a way to
read Binhexed files. My advice: Get hold of a copy of the shareware
program Winzip, version 6.2. There is a Win 3.x version and a Win 95/NT
version. They can handle Binhexed files, in addition to several other
formats which are often found in emails. Or at least, the online help says
so.
Winzip is available from http://www.winzip.com, and I found it worth the
registration fee.

        -  Hans

Hi folks,

I just got pine 3.95 on HP-UX and it works fine.

As a matter of fact, I want to use pine as an alternative for me to
send email using an SMTP server since the sendmail command
is not correctly set-up.

So simple question : can I use pine as a command and avoid starting
a pine session (like one would use the sendmail command)?

Thanx a lot

I use Pine as my email program on a SunOS 4.1.4 machine.
When I try to use when remotely logged on from a different
Unix server, I get a message saying:

   "Clear Screen Capability is required"

Is this an stty setting I need to enable?
If so, which one?
I looked at the stty settings on the SunOS machine and it
is not obvious to me.

Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, and information on where to obtain the software, can
   be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer -- whichever organization provided you with the
   email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number of
   Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users.
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   http://www.smartpages.com/faqs/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu//pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as popclient can be used to download
   email from a POP server to a local Unix account, where it can then be
   accessed with Pine. One location from which popclient can be obtained
   is:
   ftp://ftp.mal.com/pub/pop/
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

Hi Pine Users...

   Can someone tell me what Pine uses to distinguish between 1 message and
the next.  For example, if I were to type out 2 consecutive messages
(header+body), I get one long text file.  When I cat the /var/spool/mail
file, it's one long text file, yet Pine can divide the text file into
separate messages.  I think this convention works for all e-mail
readers...but don't know what it is...
   Any answer would be appreciated.  Thanks.

   Someone somewhere posted a script which would detect if Netscape was
   already running and start a new one only if it wasn't. That could be
   useful here.

I think I got these mailcap entries by replying to the author of a post,
rather than seeing them posted here.  I believe they will meet your
needs.

Yes, and better (if I recall) than version 3.92, through the

     I heard that this is a bug in "sendmail". It is true?

Old sendmails, when presented with a message without a To: line, would
fill in an Apparently-To: line with the local recipients; and current
sendmails can be configured still to do this.  So the short answer is
"yes."

Hi Katherine:
	I think you need to be a bit more explicit about what you mean by 
exporting from a word-processor.  Are you using FTP (or KERMIT or 
whatever) to transfer a document to your unix homedirectory?  If so, are 
you then uuencoding the document before e-mailing it?  You probably need 
to provide details of this sort before anyone can offer helpful suggestions.

    I use trn in a kind of batch mode to implement killfiles
immediately before invoking Pine.  It's a little klunky, but it's
better than the nothing of Pine, which I agree is grievously lacking 
this regard.  Email me if you'd like details and a script.

    Not with Pine.  Sorry.  There may be other non-Pine techniques,
although I am not familiar with them.

    By itself, Pine will not show you umlauts -- or any other
diacritical mark on any character.  For display purposes, Pine simply
takes whatever bit pattern there is for each character and passes it
unchanged to the display hardware you are using, or to the
communication link, as the case may be.  In a sense, Pine doesn't show
you *anything* -- your hardware does.

    Therefore, your hardware display must be capable of displaying the
characters, and you must make sure that any communications link doesn't
mess things up (such as stripping off the high-order bit from each
character).

    For example, I use a DOS PC dialed into a Un*x system, on which
Pine runs.  I get mail and newsgroup postings in ISO-8859-1.  To view
those postings correctly, I must load code page 819 on my PC, in place
of the default code page 437.  You may need to do something comparable
or analogous to make sure that your hardware is displaying the proper
characters.  (DOS code pages are essentially instructions to the
hardware how to display all 256 possible characters in non-graphics
mode.)

    Pine is probably not the problem here.

I've just had an interesting problem come up with a Solaris Pine 3.95
user receiving email from a Windows Eudora Lite 1.5.4 client.

My user didn't understand why he was seeing a 'the charset is in "iso-8859-1"
format, your display supports ISO-8859-1,ISO-88592,ISO-8859-3 all the way
to 9' type message. Here are the headers that caused that:

[Gotta love that mangled From: line.]

As far as I can see, the Windows Eudora Lite is generating 
Content-Type: headers where the 'ISO' of ISO-8859-x is in lower
case and is 'iso'. Since I've only ever seen ISO-8859-x written
in upper-case, this strikes me as sloppy. On the other hand, headers
should not be case-dependent (any case-dependent stuff is rotten
legacy code that needs fixing, IMHO), and Pine 3.95 ought to be capable of
recognising that 'iso-8859-1' and 'ISO-8859-1' are one and the
same thing (and that US-SCII is US-ascii is us-ascii is... you
get the idea).

It looks to me that Eudora is really the one at fault here for
not rigidly following the capitalisation, but that Pine's handling
of case variants is brain-dead and turns a small problem into
a bigger problem. (No big deal for ISO-8859-1 here, but once you
get to the more exotic variants like -7 and you're dealing with
people unused to computers who are uncomfortable with English,
uncomfortable with reading English manuals and even more uncomfortable
with the gibberish on their screens resulting from ISO misinterpretation,
you see where my time is going to be going in future.)

Can I request that Eudora stick with convention (ISO should be caps)
and that Pine be more tolerant in future releases? Writing robust code
capable of handling case variations sensibly is, I would have thought,
fairly trivial.

(Although Netscape can't seem to handle it consistently for &amp; &Amp;
&AMP; &AmP; despite their many releases and person-years of hackery.)

Thanks,

L.

I am having problems recieving my mail messages from others, and I am 
wondering why this is happening.  It is getting really annoying because 
this has been going on for some time now, and my friends are getting a 
little angry at me when I am not responding to their mail on time.
    If their is anything that I can do to correct this little problem 
just let me know.
                                             Thank YOu.

Hello,

In my Pine INBOX I have the message count as 313. I quit pine and go to 
IRC. Now the status bar at IRC shows mail as 318. I am not able to 
understand where are the messages from 314 to 318.

I even sent a test mail to check whether I as still recieving mail. Now 
the INBOX is showing the mail to be at 314, while IRC shows it as 319.

Can anyone please help?

Thanks, Dinesh.

Would anyone know how I can have mail sent using Pine
	from my su - session to handled as from root@mydomain.com
	or support@mydomain.com  when I send mail using pine.

	Situation is,  I have to do a lot of followups from home
	to our clients and whenever I send mail from the root acct,
	it shows my original login name.  But "of course" anything
	I send from the console at the office logged in as root
	gets sent with the support@mydomain.com

	In my root .bashrc  i have USERNAME=$LOGNAME
	and I have tried everything else under the sun.
	even USERNAME=SUPPORT   etc;

	Attempts to tweek the pinerc have been also negatory..
	Any answers would greatly appreciated.

Pine gurus,
	Brief question.. I like to use tin to read my news, hence would NOT
like to see the news section of pine at all (as in when there is no nntp server
defined).  However, I would like to be able to reply to email which have
newsgroups in the header, so that my reply will be posted to the newsgroup..
I'd also like to be able to simply post from pine by using rich headers.
It doesn't look like this can be done from the config file, since as soon
as it's aware of an nntp server, it becomes fully news-aware. Can I patch
pine to do this?
	Thanks,
		Paul

PS: this is pine for UNIX, if it makes a difference..

Hi!

Some of our pine users have reported the same problem with pine 3.95:
Pine crashes with the following error message:

sendsig: can't grow stack, pid 13137, proc pine%   |]
Illegal instruction (core dumped)

I have not been able to reproduce this problem with my own pine
configuration, so it might be a configuration problem. Our system
is DECstation 5000/125, Ultrix 4.5 operating system and 64 MB of
physical memory.

My problem is similar. I need to add a "from:" header line, which I do now
using the manual "headers:user..." technique. Looking at your reply-to.html
page, I saw your description of the "elmheaders" file. My .elm directory
does not contain such a file. Basically, I want the header change to be
universal and permanent, so changing the elmheaders file sounds like the
solution, but do I need to create the file myself or can I download a
template from somewhere? Thanks,

I learned recently that we also had a failure of the ftp host last
week, so Linda might have hit us at a bad time :(

(Actually the host was just fine... it's just that there weren't any files
on it for awhile.)

    Frequently, using Bcc: (Blind Carbon Copy) or Lcc: (List Carbon
Copy) is a courtesy and convenience to the recipients, and concealment
has nothing to do with it.  Suppose you want to send a single email to
500 address.  If you list them all under To: or Cc:, then each
recipient is going to have to scroll through screen after screen of
addresses to get down to the message.  This is irritating to many
people, and they don't want to look at this huge list of addresses. 
Using Bcc: or Lcc: make it easy for them.

    Also, If I write an original piece of email and send it to you,
then unless we have some sort of agreement between us, I have the right
to send to to whomever else I wish.  It is my work, my production, and
I can do with it whatever I want -- including sending it to other
people without telling you -- unless we already have an agreement to
the contrary.  I see no ethical difficulties whatever, and I am not
aware of any legal restrictions.

I am working with Pine Version 3.90 on an DEC Alpha Server.

I would like to know how I can restrict the number
messages stored on the UNIX server by the email clients.  

Or 

How to restrict the amount of disk space they can tie up before they have
to delete 
some of their old messages.

Thanks.

Using Pine 3.93 (with procmail) under SunOS 5.5.1, how do I have messages
from a mailing list sent into a different folder?  I tried the method in
Nancy McGough's Filtering Mail FAQ, but it didn't work... it sent all the
messages to the same folder.  What I want to do is take all messages thta
have [pal] anywhere in the subject line and divert them to a different
folder.

I'm currently using pine V3.95 for UNIX. When I'm reading a message, I
want to use the 'return' key as a line advance...but it complains that the
enter key is not defined.  Is there any way of defining what the return
key should do?

Thanks,

Hello,

I am presently using 2 different news servers.
Is it possible to have different .newsrc file for each server? How?

Thanks, Dinesh.

This assumes you have unzipped/uncompressed the files into wherever you want to
keep the source.  If you haven't got that far, you'll have to figure out on your
own (it's not hard ;)

% cd <source directory called pine-x.xx>

Pine info recently responded to a message concerning suppressing E-mail
addresses from the following inquiry:

    Frequently, using Bcc: (Blind Carbon Copy) or Lcc: (List Carbon
Copy) is a courtesy and convenience to the recipients, and concealment
has nothing to do with it.  Suppose you want to send a single email to
500 address.  If you list them all under To: or Cc:, then each
recipient is going to have to scroll through screen after screen of
addresses to get down to the message.  This is irritating to many
people, and they don't want to look at this huge list of addresses.
Using Bcc: or Lcc: make it easy for them.>

Could you please tell me how you implement BCC and/or LCC in Pine?  thanks Jim

I can make a guess: a few of the messages contain lines starting with
"From " within them. IRC thinks this means the beginning of a new message,
while pine is a bit smarter about how to recognize true message
delimiters.

That's your problem. It should be:

drwxrwxrwt

Full access to everyone, but the sticky bit set to prevent deletion of
other people's files.

Why not configure Pine to use IMAP for the secondary folders too?
It's more efficient and avoids the NFS locking problems.

Didn't know I could do that.  Thanks a lot!  A number of questions
come to mind:

   -- do I specify a complete path? or just a path relative to
      home directories?
   -- with this make the folder-tree recursively accessibel
      thru imap? 

Is there a document that I can read?  I've been thru the tech-notes,
the FAQ, the man pages ... nothing there.

Thanks again for your help.

In the absence of a leading slash, home-dir relative is assumed.

At the moment, you have to define a separate folder collection for
each directory or subdirectory with folders in it.  Pine 4.0 will
support folder hierarchies more flexibly.

Only the help for the Folder-collections variable in Setup/Config

Here's a sample from my .pinerc:

folder-collections=MAIN {shivams.cac.washington.edu/user=gray}MAIL/[*],
                           Pine {shivams.cac.washington.edu}PINE/[*]

Yup.. just go to Setup/Config.. And enter the following for 
news-collections: ""
 i.e. a empty/null/blank value.
This will prevent the news collection from showing up in your
Folder List.

But as long as you have nntp-server defined, you should still be able to
post to newsgroups thru the rich headers or simply reply to any mail
which has a newsgroup in the header.

I was having some problems with mail once my ISP upgraded to v3.95 as
well.  Contact your ISP administrator to see if there's a problem on their
side... that cleared it up for me.

  As far as I know, Pine can't do this.
  If you're using UNIX, you can try "at", "cron", etc. They allow you to
run a script at specified times. 
  If you're dialing up to a shell account, you can set up your terminal
program such that it runs a script at the specified time. That script will
dial into your account, log on, send the e-mail, and log off. 

  Hope this helps.

Since we are in comp.mail.pine, I agree with you.  However, with Visual
Basic getting more and more widespread on personal computers, it's quite
possible to have Macro Viruses propagate from one system to the other in
Mail attachments; you won't have to save and execute anything.  Viewing
the mail with the appropriate software (e.g., Word) should be sufficient
to get into trouble.

Similar problems seem to have been considered several years ago:  The
default mailcaps file which is distributed with the metamail MIME
reference implementation handles PostScript attachments by sending them
to the printer to not have them do any harm to the system.

On another note, did anyone notice the nice inconsistency in the Irina
announcement?  The proposed solution is not to *read* the message after
it has been received.  Nevertheless, a few lines later the posting
claims that the code is executed when the virus is saved on the
*server*'s disk.

No.  Just create the file with any editor.  Or just use echo:

	echo From: Mike Berger \<mberger@pdn-pix.com\> > $HOME/.elm/elmheaders

If you need an example then take a look at mine:

	http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/elm/elmheaders

MUTT users can do this via the muttrc (no extra file required):

	my_hdr From: guckes@math.fu-berlin.de (Sven Guckes)
	my_hdr X-Mailer-Info: http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/mutt/

Or is you use header editing then just add anything to your header.  :-)

    Depending on how current your version of Pine is, you can do one
and maybe two different things.  In any case, you can put the list of
recipient addresses (using a nickname, if you have one) in the Bcc:
header field.  In that case, _be_sure_ to put *something* in the To:
field, such as your own address (you have to "fake out" the mailing
system).  If you have a later version of Pine, you can use the Lcc:
header field.  Both of these should be amply explained in the online
help.  (Use ^R to get "Rich Headers" if you need to in order to use
these fields.)

Hello,

What is a tin? Is it another method of reading newsgroups?

Is there a way to read and post to newsgroups, without using the news 
servers? Is there a gateway, which transfer all the messages to 
newsgroups to a systems similar to the email mailing list? I am aware of 
the www interface to newsgroups, but would like to use Pine.

Thanks, Dinesh.

Hello,
Is there a way where by which, messages sent to a particular address is 
saved in a particular folder automatically? For example, I send a lot of 
mail to Pine mailing list. I would like to save all the messasges send by 
me to the Pine list to a separate folder automatically.

Thanks for the help.

Not that I am aware of.  However, you can do what I do.  I have one 
NEWSRC. file (I am under VMS).  The lines of my pine.pinerc file, in the 
news-collections section read:

*{ferntree.com.au/nntp}[aus.*]
*{ferntree.com.au/nntp}[comp.*]
*{ntx.city.unisa.edu.au/nntp}[unisa.*]

(My newsrc file is something like:

aus.computers.amiga xx-xxx
aus.computers.mac xx-xxx
comp.mail.pine xx-xxx
unisa.general xx-xxx

(but with more entries)

This way, I have four collections - my local mail collection, with INBOX, 
MAIL etc, and three remote news-collections.  It is not the most elegant 
setup, but it works.

BTW, you can only post to the first entry in the nntp-server config entries.

Save all the messages (using the aggregate command ;AAS) to a new folder
from within pine, then rename the new folder.

Well, you can pseudo-thread in PINE by selecting OrderedSubj in sort-key
in Config/Setup.  Of course, all your folders will sort this way by
default.  Though it's not TRUE threading (hence, pseudo), it works quite
well.  As for killfiles, we'll have to wait and see if the PINE
development team will add that feature, which is highly requested.

To use Bcc and/or Lcc with Pine...

1.  Upgrade to Pine 3.95

2.  Start composing a message.

3.  Put cursor on any header line of your message.

4.  Type ^R (Rich Headers), shown in the Command Menu at the bottom of the
    screen.

5.  Use the Bcc: and/or Lcc: fields thus revealed.

Cheers,

I'm not sure if you can help me or not, but I have a Mac computer at home 
and use Mac PPP to try to retrive my email messages.  All works find 
until I hit the 2 to check email.  Then there are all kinds of extra 
characters and I connot read.  Have any idea what needs to be done?  I 
have checked the email thru the LRC Mac computers and have no problems.  
I have tried to call for help, but the day people tell me to talk to the 
night people and the night people tell me to talk to the day people.  Let 
me know if you have any ideas!

An odd thing has been occurring.  I use PINE to view/post/whatever
newsgroups with little difficulty at all.  However, recently, one
particular newsgroup (specifically rec.music.phish), opens with no
messages in folder.  I know that there are messages in this folder.  
Does anybody know what I can do so that the messages will load?
Thanks,
jonathansen

Anyone heard of "Good Times"? This sounds suspiciously like a "Good
Times"-type virus hoax. Do NOT forward the message to anyone else..."Irina"
cannot possibly do any harm to your system.

Viruses spread by email can only take effect if 1) they are included in an
executable attachment to the email, and 2) the attachment is saved locally
and executed. Just reading a mail cannot cause any harm to your system.

So if you find a message prattling on about an email virus, delete it and do
not forward it to anyone else.

Assuming you use a telnet application and log into your Unix machine to
use Pine.  The problem may be caused by the control characters that Pine
uses to clear the screen, bold-face some letters, etc.  Your terminal
emulation may have been pure VT100 that does not have support of those
control characters.  Try to use VT200/220, even VT102 and see if you can
overcome the problem.

Which telnet program do you use?  NCSA Telnet?  I use Comet from Cornell
U. (freeware, available on info-mac) most of time.  I also use freeware
NiftyTelnet from Carnegie Melon U. (URL is:
http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/dist/niftytelnet.html).  Both Comet and 
NiftyTelnet can display Pine menus properly.

Alternatively, you can get a copy of MailDrop client for Mac and access
your emails just as easily.  MailDrop is freeware from Baylor U. and the
URL is:

	http://ackmo.baylor.edu/files/Mail_Drop/info.html

and make sure you have the latest development version (1.2d7d as of today).

Cheers!

Hi there -

I encountered this peculiar phenomenon which the local staff couldn't
explain, so I thought I might try it here. I'm sorry if I should have
overseen any information where this problem is classified as standard ... 
I unfortunately couldn't find any such source. Well, to reduce band-width,
here we go: I received mail from Germany, MIME-1.0 encoded und pure text,
containing German special characters presumably correctly encoded as "=81"
and similar (which should turn out to be vocals with dots on them). But
Pine 3.91 under UNIX (cde ... cough) won't display them properly, adding
newlines and such. The original Content-Type was text/plain. Adding the
charset information (iso...) didn't change a thing. Could it be a problem
with my font (which of course is iso-encoded; so were the other four or
five which I tried)? 

Thanks in advance for any reply
C.

To the persons at Sun Microsystems who will be receiving this via blind
carbon copy:  TAKE NOTE.  This is going directly to CERT and CIAC if I can't
get a resolution.  I've worked with UNIX-based systems including SunOS and
Solaris long enough to know what's a problem with the kernel.

I have stumbled upon a problem that I can reproduce on all our systems every
time, and apparently can be reproduced by other readers of USENET as will be
documented below.  Simply put, if configured properly, the Pine mail reader,
versions 3.94 and 3.95, can *freeze* the Solaris 2.5 and 2.5.1 kernel
completely.  No core dump or the like--an outright freeze.  No TCP/IP pings
work--network is frozen.  Even the keyboard sometimes freezes and pressing
the xxx-Lock keys doesn't light the respective indicator light.

This may at first sound like a problem Sun can shun because they "do not
support Pine," but think about this:  In a protected-memory environment such
as Solaris, NO USER PROGRAM SHOULD EVER FREEZE THE COMPUTER.  That's what
protected memory is for.  Pine is not run with any special privileges, only
as a regular user--and a regular user does not have the ability to cause the
computer to halt.

Hence, Pine has triggered a bug in the Solaris kernel--a product of Sun's.
I daresay this could exist in releases of Solaris/x86 as early as 2.3, and
nothing has been done about it.  And if Pine can do it, that means other
programs have the same potential.  More than anything else right now, I'm
looking to see that this problem can be reproduced on other systems.

You can most certainly try to reproduce this yourself!  You'll need the
following to do the experiment:

- the binary of Pine 3.95 and the respective .pinerc file from my FTP site
  at ftp://ftp.iag.net/pub/tv/ -- files "pine.Z" (decompress this) and
  "pinerc" (name this .pinerc in your home directory).  Uh, you can trust
  the binary--up to the point of system freeze, that is.  :/

OR:

- GCC version 2.7.2 or 2.7.2.1, NOT the ProCompiler (as I do not know if
  a ProCompiler compiled version will recreate this).

- Pine 3.95 sources from ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine3.95.tar.gz.

  You'll need to twiddle some things for "./build sol" to work:  make sure
  that /usr/ccs/bin/ucbcc AND /usr/ccs/bin/cc point to gcc; /usr/ccs/bin
  is in your path; /usr/ucb is not before /usr/bin or /usr/ccs/bin in your
  path; and "." is the last entry in your path.

- A .pinerc with inbox-path= set to an IMAP server.  You can do this by
  running Pine, going to (S)etup (C)onfig, and setting the value to a
  server with IMAP (I use {imap.afn.org}INBOX where I have one of my e-mail
  accounts).  Or use the one from my FTP site above.

All you should need to do now is run Pine.  If you get a login prompt, ^C,
(Q)uit, and run it again a few times.  Betcha it'll lock the system.  It
does for us, consistently.

I'd love to hear of other reports of this happening.  It's quite frustrating
to find that a product that has such intense corporate backing has none at
all when any outside product is in use (even when the outside product is
only triggering a bug in the supported product).  My report of this problem
was sent in as an "enhancement request," because an outside program was what
triggered the error and there was not 100% Sun Supported(tm) software in
the setup.

Sun Microsystems, you can do better than this.  I hope your kernel group
finally breaks down to find out what's going on.

As I just said to someone with the opposite problem: Save to a new

Why this rather desperate desire to have both mail and news in one package?
Why not just select and combine the best programs there are around - editor,
mail program, newsreader? Switching between mail and news programs is a
matter of seconds, and takes no longer than switching between functions
inside the rather slow and sluggish pine. 

Wouldn't it be better if the pine team concentrated on making the mail
program better and faster, and at least for the time being left the news
business to specialists?

pretty simple, really.

It looks for a blank line, followed by the word "From "

The word "From " must be right up against the left margin, and it  
must have a space after it.

When a mail message is received by "sendmail" (and I assume any  
other mail program) it requires that the message begins with a "From  
" and ends with a "." (also left-justified, on a line by itself).   
Then it scans the message to make sure the word "From " doesn't  
appear anywhere as the first word on a line.  If it is found,  
sendmail will put a ">" in front of it

I'll show you what I mean with this sentence: "This message is from  
me to you."  Now that's OK because the word "From " is not the  
first word.  (It also isn't capitalized.).

But the next "From " will get a ">" in this:
This
Message
Is
From
Me

the "From " that I wrote doesn't have a ">", but when it gets to  
you it will

This
Is
A
From
without
a
space
after
it

A
lowercase
from
with
a
space

and
a
lowercase
from
without
a
space

Hope that helps...

but doesn't changing the user domain mean that *any* local user is assumed
to have such an address? Suppose you are using the host host.my.org and
set the user domain to my.org so your address in pine becomes me@my.org
(if your login is me). However, suppose you write a mail to root, will
pine not automatically assume that you're sending that mail to root@my.org
instead of root@host.my.org?

Is there any way to tell PINE to open up in 'compose' with a certain file in the message body or attached, "To" a certain person, and with a certain "Subject"?  This is probably a lot to ask as far as automation, but it's pretty important.  Here's what I've got that comes close:

pine < /home/DATAX/PMAIL.TXT craig@fse-power.com

This'll open it up in "Compose" with PMAIL.TXT in the body and enter 'craig@fse-power.com' in the recipients list, but how do I tell it to automatically put a certain string in the Subject?

Another question:
How does PINE define the Message ID for a given message?  Is it some totally random string?  Is it possible to tack on a string of your own to make it useful in tracking specific e-mails (like e-mailed Purchase Orders, etc.)?

You're an amazing person, thanks!  :)  It worked like a charm.  I wonder

This warning was a stupid publicity stunt by Penguin books, for a new release
which was also available on the web or something.  They assumed that most people
would recognize it as the *exact same text* of the Good Times warning, only with
the word "Irina" substituted for "Good Times".  Of course, they were wrong - and
simpletons have been forwarding the warning for months now.  Sheesh.

I have an Apple IIGS and a Panasonic printer.  I have tried everything to 
get it to print, but I am completely in the dark.  I believe it is all 
connected properly to the computer and the fingerprint card.  I would 
really like some advice, please.

Thank you Holger; That's the most intelligent post on this newsgroup in
weeks.  He has a good point folks.  PINE is IMHO the best email program
around for both novices and propellerheads.  Sure it has a few hard to use
features, but they're all there if you take the time to read the help and
run thru the Setup and Config and learn how to use the ? context sensitive
help screens.  Having said that, pine is NOT a very good newsreader, in
fact it's probably one of the worst.  TIN is far better if you are on an
ISP with a shell account.  It can thread, has killfile capability, etc all
the stuff everyone is complaining about here.  Mail and News are 2
different animals, and while pine allows us to also copy to news and tin
allows us to also send mail, IMO using pine as a newsreader is about as
smart as using tin as a mail program or using your microwave as an oven or
using your lawnmower as a food processor; They were designed for 2
different things.  That's it; I'm done preaching;  Now I'm gonna post this
from TIN and go to PINE to read my email.  All flames are welcome; It's
cold here ;-)

i do completely agree, i use pine for reading mails, vim to compose them
and trn to read news.... and am really happy with it... what do you don't
like with trn? it is trheaded and has killfile support and lots more...

yes, leave the news support and please concentrate on full imap4 protocol :)

USEnet has become so rediculous these days... Subscribe to one newsgroup,
and you're assaulted with 1000 posts per day, written by folks who
probably barely know how to breathe who feel obligated to crosspost in
about a hundred other newsgroups.

Anyway, that being said (*G*) I've found that I actually enjoy Pine's
newsreader, since anymore I only subscribe to three low volume newsgroups,
where threading and other advanced features aren't really a concern. It's
kind of handy to have the newsgroups listed right below my mail folders.

Pine 3.95 is giving me a few problems...I've installed it and all seems
to be working well except for the global address book.  Some of my users
can't seem to access it...when entering the address book and scrolling
down to the global portion, it will say 'permission denied'...

Has anybody else run across this, and if so how do I fix it?

Any help greatly appriciated...

Check:
- Value (the path) of <global-address-book> in your pine-config-file(s)
- Permission of the global-address-book and the corresponding look-up-file
  (global-address-book.lu)
- Permission of all directories on the path from / to global-address-book.

I was wondering how I export ALL my messages in a certain folder at once. 
I am using pine on our Uni's file server, and I open up a folder such as a
newsgroup, I want to be able to export every message one by one, yes all
1500 messages. I know you can select the messages by pressing ' ; ' and
selecting the specific criteria. I tried to use e for export but that just
didn't work. The only reason why I figured it didn't work is because it
doesn't know what name to call each file? If that is the problem is there
a way to use a certain string as the filename mask at the start, say
'news.' then have it sequentially number each message after that?
If anyone can help PLEASE mail me with any suggestions.

Thanx in advance,

	Matt.

Subject: Another multiple-user problem !

I wish to allow students to telnet into the e-mail server (SUN Netra) to use
PINE, however I have been informed that this will cause undue strain on the
Netra. Is there a method by which we can provide a '95 front-end to PINE,
remembering that it cannot be specific to any user. In summary, what I'm
looking for is a solution without using telnet, through WIN '95 allowing
user to enter a user-id and password to retrieve mail using the PINE system
on the Netra. I am currently running tcp/ip & ipx/spx. Any ideas ?

Many thanks.

If you're decoding them in UNIX, there should be a UUDECODER already there.
Just type uudecode followed by the filename.  If you want to do this in
DOS, I suggest going to oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtelnet/msdos/00_start and
looking for uudecode programs.

Frederick Moor:

We're running Pine v3.95 under IBM AIX v4.1.4.  The source code was pulled from 
cac.washington.edu and compiled on our machine.  Most of the folks who have 
simply downloaded the binaries seem to have had many problems; so, we did the 
compiling ourselves.

I hope this information helps you out.

- Michael

Yakima Products, Inc.                   Ph:    707-826-8175
P.O. Box 4899, Arcata, CA 95521 (USA)   Fx:    707-826-8149
-------------------------------------------------------------


After downloading the source files, the following steps were done:
     1.   Copy the pine3.95.tar file into the local programs directory:
               mkdir /programs
               mv pine3.95.tar /programs/.
     
     2.   Unzip the Pine email program into its directory tree:
               cd /programs
               cat pine3.95.tar | tar xvf -

     3.   Update the PICO editor to not freeze under AIX 4.1 (which changes
          Pico editor to use terminfo).  These alterations were recommended
          by a couple of Pine sites.

          a.   Move into the PICO directory:  cd /programs/pine3.95/pico
          b.   Edit makefile.a41 change tcap.c/tcap.o entries to tinfo.c/tinfo.o
          c.   Edit os_unix.h and update the following (note the added a41
               define):
                    /* Machine/OS definition                        */
                    #if     defined(ptx) || defined(sgi) || defined(sv4) ||
                              defined(sco) || defined(a41)
                    #define TERMINFO        1       /* Use TERMINFO */
                    #else
                    #define TERMCAP         1       /* Use TERMCAP  */
                    #endif
          d.   Edit tinfo.c (in routine tinfoopen()):
                   if (Pmaster) {
                       /*
                        *  setupterm() automatically retrieves the value
                        *  of the TERM variable.
                        */
                       int err;
                       setupterm ((char *)0, 1, &err);      /* <-- Add cast */
                       if (err != 1) return FALSE;
                   }
                   else {
                       /*
                        * setupterm() issues a message and exits, if the
                        * terminfo data base is gone or the term type is
                        * unknown, if arg2 is 0.
                        */
                       setupterm ((char *)0, 1, (int *)0);  /* <-- Add cast */
                   }

          With these small changes Pine 3.95 has been rock solid under AIX
          4.1.4 or 4.2.
     
     4.   Make sure the /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin directories exist
          before you go any further.  MUST be done prior to compiling the
          Pine email program.

     5.   Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in everyone's path, so these
          programs can be run.  The /usr/local/bin directory is where UNIX
          expects to find site-specific programs (such as email, utiliites).

     6.   Compile the Pine email program for AIX v4.1.x:
               cd /programs/pine3.95
               build clean
               build a41
     
     7.   Link the Pine binary programs into the directory that all users
          are supposed to see:
               ln -s /programs/pine3.95/bin/imapd /usr/local/bin/imapd
               ln -s /programs/pine3.95/bin/mtest /usr/local/bin/mtest
               ln -s /programs/pine3.95/bin/pico /usr/local/bin/pico
               ln -s /programs/pine3.95/bin/pilot /usr/local/bin/pilot
               ln -s /programs/pine3.95/bin/pine /usr/local/bin/pine
     
          Note:  Instead of linking the programs, a script/batch file can
          be written that will run Pine; that script file could be created in
          the /admin/scripts directory:  /admin/scripts/pine

     8.   Create and update the Pine global config file for all users:
     
          a.   pine -conf > /usr/local/lib/pine.conf
               vi /usr/local/lib/pine.conf
     
          b.   Edit the default printer for all users:
               personal-print-command=HP Laserjet IIISI [] lp -dhpiiisi_1
     
          c.   Edit the SMTP server connection, if SENDMAIL should not
               be used and if SMTP should be talked to directly:
               smtp-server=     ??? don't know what to put here
     
     9.   Update the user menu to call the appropriate programs.

     10.  Make a new global addressbook (from the /etc/passwd file):
          a.   # pine-addressbook
          b.   Edit the output /tmp/.addressbook.new file and strip out the
               junk email addresses we do not want in the addressbook.
          c.   # mv /tmp/.addressbook.new /usr/local/lib/.addressbook
          d.   # pine-address-index

v3.95.

Michael,

I was browsing the pine-info today and say your note about the difference
in the size of Pine for 3.2x and 4.x.  While I have not compiled pine for
either of these environments, I can tell you that the sizes you list are
consistent with the file sizes shown in the binary ftp @
cac.washington.edu.  I was curious as to why the 4.x version would be
smaller when I noticed the difference.

I have downloaded the 3.2.x binaries and am now in the process of trying
to set pine up on my AIX box.  The documentation is rather misleading
when it says that all one has to do to run the application is to move the
binaries to /usr/bin.  I have done that but I receive "No host name of
domain set" when I try to run the application.  The documentation seems
to indicate that nothing needs to be set for the user-domain!?!

I am in the process of studying the documentation that I downloaded to
try and determine what needs to be in the pine.conf.  However, to make
the process a bit more efficient, I thought I might ask somebody who has
set up pine if I could see their pine.conf so that I can see what one
looks like.  I understand that many of the variables will need to be
changed but I think and example would be helpful.

Any help that you could offer would be much appreciated.

To whom it may concern:

I have been using Pine for two years.  However, this is the first time
that I find a problem with the software.

Lately, whenever I open up Pine, I always get a message saying:
Error writing /web/guide/netperfect/.pinerc : Permission denied

I wonder if this is a problem caused by my mail storage space, becuase now
as I am composing this message, I am getting a warning message saying "No
room for file: Permission denied." 

Thanks for your help!

My PC-Pine crashes when I go "To Flders" after pressing "S" while

multiple inboxes, etc.  Also, it will crash if I try the
"Prev Collection" or "Next Collection" options.  I'm in NT 4.0,

The instruction at "0x0046f4a6" referenced memory at "0x5d7365d3".  The

Any ideas?

The "Bcc:" header (Blind Carbon Copy) takes a list of e-mail addresses of
people to whom the message is to be sent.  Anyone listed in the Bcc field
receives a copy of the message, but this fact is not revealed to the
others, nor to those listed as recipients in the To or Cc fields.

However some mail delivery software may reveal the Bcc recipients as a
series of "Apparently-to:" headers added to the delivered message unless
at least one recipient is listed in the "To:" field.

Thus if you use Bcc then you should also make sure you have at least one
e-mail address present in the To field.  This could be your own perhaps,
or a special address of the form:

	Descriptive text name:;
eg,
	Various Recipients:;

(The important part is the ":;" at the end.)

The "Lcc:" field is designed to be used with Pine's Distribution Lists
(which can be set up in its Address Book).  Here you just type the
nickname of the distribution list into the Lcc field.  This "expands" to
the list of recipients, and the long descriptive name of the list is then
automatically placed in the To field, along with the magic ":;".

*** All this information is available in Pine's built-in help: just start
*** your message and give the ^R (Rich Header) command... then put your
*** cursor on one of the headers you want to learn about (eg, Lcc or Bcc)
*** and ask Pine for help by typing ^G (Get Help - shown in the Command
*** Menu at the bottom of the screen). 

The e-mail addresses must be typed in by hand into the header field, or
set up as a distribution list in your address book.  There is no direct
way to read a file's contents into these fields as a list of e-mail
addresses.

However that is not to say it can't be fudged: providing the file contains
a comma-separated list of e-mail addresses you can read it into the main
Message Text area (using ^R there to Read File) then cut (multiple ^K's or
a Mark-Move-^Kut) and pasted (unKut with ^U) into the appropriate header
field. 

However in the longer term you may want to look at setting up and using a
Distribution List within Pine's Address Book ("A" from the Main Menu
screen).

Certainly...

1.  Start your message in Pine.
2.  Put your cursor on the "To:" field
3.  Ask Pine for help by typing ^G (shown in the Command Menu at the
    bottom of the screen)
4.  Read help text (especially the second paragraph, straight after:
	------------------------
	| Email Address Format |
	------------------------
    )

It *is* possible to export all (or just selected) messages in a folder to
a file.

It is *not* possible (except doing each in turn yourself) all (or
selected) messages in a folder into _separate_ files.

If you wish you could do the former and then write a little program to
post-process the file containing the exported messages into separate files
for each message.

To export all messages in a folder into one file...

0.  Make sure you have the "enable-aggregate-command-set" option enabled
    in Pine's Setup Configuration screen.

1.  Go to the Index screen of the foler you want to export the messages
    from.

2.  Type:

	;		... Select
	A		... All messages
	A		... Apply a command to the selected messages
	E		... apply the Export command
	filename	... give the name of the file to contain the
			    exported messages

When I compare it to - e.g. - slrn, pine is missing many, many valuable
features without which you can't survive in today's Usenet (except you
are confining yourself to very few low-traffic groups).  Just the two
most important points:

- There is no such thing as scoring.

- There is no such thing as References-based threading.

BUT - do we really want Pine to be a first-class nwesreader?  Do we
really need yet another Emacs/Netscape?  Is it a good thing at all that
pine includes a news reader?  I don't think so.   I don't think that one
program should try to do almost everything (well, emacs is an exception
;-).  I don't object against a newsreader with all the modern features
that has a user interface similar to the mail user agent and integrates
it when you reply to a news article.

But I'd really like the two of them to be put into different programs -
maybe with lots of shared code, but that can be put into a shared
library.

Well, the pine which is running here currently takes about 14M of RAM
after having closed a rather huge mail folder.  I wouldn't call that
small or lean.

Hi,

	I've recently (with a bit of help) managed to configure pine to
let me read the news groups, however when I have read a message it marks
it as read but next time I access the newsgroup it is marked as unread.

	If anyone could throw some light on this I'd be most appreciative.

Cheers, Kris.

    Because that's the way it works. :-)  It is presumed that you
already know your own name, in which case to whom you sent something
might be more useful information.

Forces beyond our control have forced our Pine users to switch to HP
OpenMail.

Does anyone know a way to convert Pine mail folders to the equivalent in
OpenMail?  How about address books?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, as the forces have decreed that

Hi !

I would like to know whether 'pine e-mail software' provides a procedure 
by which one can extract an e-mail address from the BODY (not Header) of 
the e-mail and add it to the Address Book, for example,

abcd <abcd@def.ghi.edu>
jklm <nop@grst.uvw.com> and so on ....

Just as it were in the header is it possible under the current versions of 
pine to add it to the address w/o actually typing all of it since there 
maybe a large number of them to be added at one time directly from the 
mail body.

Prashant

If anyone is interested, I hacked the above mentioned script because
I was on a _s_l_o_w_ machine and if someone wanted to ruin my day they
could just  send me a few encrypted email.  This gives you the option
to cancel out of the decryption.  Also I changed the filter by removing 
the "_LEADING" because a few messages I received had some extra text in
front of the pgp message.  The only thing I would like to see improved in
such a viewing filter would be for any unencrypted text to be displayed 
along with the decrypted message.

    Yes, Pine can do this if it is a recent enough version.  I am using
version 3.94.  (The current one is 3.95.)  As a test, I entered the
(T)ake command while viewing your message.  It gave me the opportunity
to select the sample email addresses you had written into the body of
your message.

Idea: I believe, when using Imap, the folder 'username' would actually
refer to '~/username' rather than '/var/spool/mail/username' (or
wherever the mail spool directory is.

That is, even though the file which contains your INBOX may be named
'username', it is not in the user's private directory and should still be
referred to as 'inbox' in folder specifications.

That is, use {mailhost}inbox rather than {mailhost}username.

Better yet, use {mailhost/user=username}inbox. (An insufficiently
documented option.)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

fcc-name-rule by-recipient 

will save a folder-carbon-copy of each(?) message to a seperate folder,
according to who it was sent to.  A better solution may be to make an 
address book entry, and include in it an FCC field...

Go into the address book screen and look at help.

Guten Tag!

In letzter Zeit haeufen sich leider wiederholt die Nachfragen bzgl. einem
angeblichen Virus "Good Times". Wir haben diesen Vorgang im Dezember 1994
ausfuehrlich verfolgt und die Resultate der Aufklaerung bereits am 7 Dezember
1994 ueber unsere Mailing-Liste (win-sec-ssc) verteilt.

Leider scheinen sich aber diese Art von Geruechten und FEHLINFORMATION

have topics you would like addressed or have feedback on what is useful and
what is not.  Please contact the editor, Allan L. Van Lehn, CIAC,

THE "Good Times" VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND

In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information requests
about a supposed "virus" which could be contracted via America OnLine, simply
by reading a message.  The following is the message that CIAC received:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.    |
|                                                                           |
|  Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on   |
| America Online being sent by E-Mail.  If you get anything called "Good    |
| Times", DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your |
| hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university
at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax.

CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that any
electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" will infect your
computer.

This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly to the
fact that many people have seen a message with "Good Times" in the header.
They delete the message without reading it, thus believing that they have
saved themselves from being attacked. These first-hand reports give a false
sense of credibility to the alert message.

There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message with
"xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a panic, because
he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses (the first time he
checked his machine in months) and found a pre-existing virus on his machine.
 He incorrectly came to the conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the
virus (this particular virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail
message).  This person then spread his alert.

As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely through
reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program must be executed.
Reading a mail message does not execute the mail message.  Yes, Trojans have
been found as executable attachments to mail messages, the most notorious
being the IBM VM Christmas Card Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm
(reference CIAC Bulletin B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).
 But this is not the case for this particular "virus" alert.

If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists, simply
ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a false rumor.

This edition of CIAC NOTES describes the recent rebirth of "Good Times",
and reiterates CIAC's previous position that "Good Times" is a hoax.

There is a rebirth of the "Good Times" urban legend. CIAC and other
response teams, along with the Federal Communications Commission and
America Online, have received numerous queries regarding the validity
of the "Good Times" virus. The current "Good Times" message appears to
be a repeat of the hoax perpetuated last December.


CIAC first released CIAC NOTES 94-04 in December 1994 which is titled
"THE 'Good Times' VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND." The original "Good Times"
message that was posted and circulated contained the following:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Here is some important information. Beware of a file called Goodtimes.    |
|                                                                           |

| Times", DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your |
| hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.   |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soon after the release of CIAC NOTES 04, another "Good
Times" message was circulated. This is the same message that is
being circulated during this recent "Good Times" rebirth. This
message includes a claim that the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) released a warning about the danger of the "Good Times"
virus. This "Good Times" hoax message contains the following:

     The FCC released a warning last Wednesday concerning a matter of
   major importance to any regular user of the InterNet.  Apparently,
   a new computer virus has been engineered by a user of America
   Online that is unparalleled in its destructive capability.  Other,
   more well-known viruses such as Stoned, Airwolf, and Michaelangelo
   pale in comparison to the prospects of this newest creation by a
   warped mentality.
     What makes this virus so terrifying, said the FCC, is the fact
   that no program needs to be exchanged for a new computer to be
   infected.

    ... { stuff deleted } ...

CIAC contacted the FCC to ensure that this reference was fabricated
and that the "Good Times" is truly a hoax.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
======================
Having malicious code (malware) buried in the body of an E-mail
message that would "infect" your computer is not a very likely
possibility because characters in an E-mail message are displayed, not
executed. CIAC still affirms that reading E-mail, using typical mail
agents, will not activate malware delivered in or with the message.

Many people believe "in theory" that malware can be delivered and
activated by some mail agents that have automated services.  An
example of such malware is mail delivered to a PC that has embedded,
seemingly invisible escape sequences which affect screen display or
program the keyboard to do some nastiness when some key is
"accidently" pressed. The following is an excerpt from CIAC NOTES
05 which included and update to the "Good Times" urban legend.

  CIAC did not claim that E-mail could not be a delivery agent for
  malware.  A real threat comes from attached files which could
  contain viruses or Trojan programs.  You should scan any executable
  attachment before executing it in the same way that you scan all new
  software before using it.  It is possible to create a file that
  remaps keys when displayed on a PC/MS-DOS machine with the ANSI.SYS
  driver loaded. However, this only works on PC/MS-DOS machines with
  the text displayed on the screen in text mode.  It would not work in
  Windows or in most text editors or mailers.  A key could be remapped
  to produce any command sequence when pressed, for example DEL or
  FORMAT.  However, the command is not issued until the remapped key
  is pressed and the command issued by the remapped key would be
  visible on the screen.  You could protect yourself by removing
  ANSI.SYS from the CONFIG.SYS file, but many DOS programs use the
  functionality of ANSI.SYS to control screen functions and colors.
  Windows programs are not effected by ANSI.SYS, though a DOS program
  running in Windows would be.

The message boundary is "\n\nFrom ". In other words, a blank line and then
"From " are the boundary. No blank line is needed ahead of the first
message in the mailbox, though. The ">", then, is only needed if "From "
follows a blank line within the body of the message.

There are other mailbox formats, though. This is a "religious" issue in
some newsgroups, like comp.mail.headers.

I have two separate SCO boxes running mmdf and pine. One will expunge 
messages from the inbox (and any other folder) the other will not. I have 
looked at and compared all the permissions on all the files/programs 
involved (at least all the ones I know about). These were
	/usr/spool/mail/???? 
	/tmp
	/usr/bin/pine

The version of pine is a precompiled version from cac.washington.edu: v3.91


Nothing appears to _me_ to be different. That's not to say they aren't 
and quite obviously there is a difference between the configurations. But 
I'll be b******d if I can see it! I have had a look at locking and can't 
see anything. I have had a look at the .pine-debug files with -d9 set. Nada.

The annoying thing is that it says it it doing it all ok, but then the 
messages are there again when I re-enter pine. 

I have logged on as root and the same thing happens. I have set the uid 
and guid for pine itself to root. Zip.

Someone please help as either my forehead or the screen is going to break 
in the not too distant future. All suggestions gratefully received...

TIA
Nick.

95% of my email is spam.


What I want is a simple procedure in which I can quickly 
(immediately? automatically?) press a small number of 
keystrokes and have a quick message sent to the sender, 
asking for that person to resend their message with 
some sort of identifier in the subject field.

The identifier which I have in mind will be a highly 
complex thing such as my name or something like that.

I want to make it easy for people who know my name to 
contact me, 

If a spammer doesn't know my name, then, well, 

Since 99% of all spam has a bogus "return" address 
field, the result of "r" has always (for me, at least) 
been bouncing email.

I would like a way to trash the N-number of bounces.

It means that Pine's future news reading capabilities will be better and
faster.  What's more, you'll still be able to do the same things with news
as with mail, and vice versa. 

What I was referring to ("the code that babbles NNTP") was not a reduction
in capability for news reading, but rather that code that is specific to
news reading is getting smaller, so there is no real savings in removing
it.  What was news-specific is becoming general purpose and used
elsewhere, e.g. in IMAP4 support.

We feel the same way.

Hi pine experts,

I have the following problem on all the users accounts :
by starting pine, I get the message :
   Can't open mailbox lock, access is readonly.

Where is this mailbox file ???

TIA

Hello,

Forget my previous mail about read-only mailbox, I'm stupid,
/tmp was read-only (my work).

Thanks

Hi All!

I'm running 3.95 on Solaris 2.5, and I've got a couple of questions.

1)  Is there any way to disable the command in Pine which allows users
to set their passwords (not mailbox passwords, but login passwords)?

2)  Pine seems to coredump very intermittently (I can't reproduce it,
but some people can).  Here's an excerpt from a .pine-debug file, but I
can't make heads or tails of the problem.  Anybody help?

 --- ADDR_BOOK_SCREEN ---

- mailcap_free -
--- addr_book ---  (AddrBookScreen)
-- init_addrbooks(HalfOpen, 1, 1, 1) --
- ab_whereis -
- ab_whereis -
about to end_tty_driver
Pine Panic: Select error: No such file or directory


Would prefer an e-mail response (slacy@mindspring.com), as I don't have
news access from work.  Will post a summary.

Thanks!

Scott

  I feel exactly the same way. Perhaps, enhanced support for
IMAP4 is much more desirable than spending a lot of time to
enhance news reader part of Pine(threading,kill file,etc).

I think I followed up a previous posting of yours asking why you were not
also posting to comp.mail.pine, or if you had mailed any of the pine
developers.  I notice the headers *still* do not list that group.  While I
agree with your contentions, I think it is prudent and responsible that word
get out to Pine users/maintainers who hang out on that group.  I will be
redirecting this to c.m.pine.

Date: 19 Nov 1996 15:36:33 GMT
Message-ID: <56sk61$ief@tear.cybercash.com>


I posted a query a couple of weeks ago about this - dunno
if it ever made it out into the world...

I'm running Pine 3.95 on a P120 under BSDI 2.0.1 w/32M
memory and 200M of swap.  Not often (only about three
times a day...grrrr) Pine will die on me with an "Out of free
storage" error when attempting to access a mailbox
that's larger than approx. 6MB in size.  I find it hard
to believe that Pine is really starved for memory resources,
so I figure it must be something else.  Anyone have
any ideas?  Is Pine simply incapable of handling large
mailboxes?  Is there some build option I missed that would
allow me to use Pine (instead of emacs) to read the "other"
part of my mail?  I also had this problem under v3.91
that was bundled as part of BSDI; I was hoping that 3.95 
would fix the problem.

If there's no fix, anyone want to suggest an IMAP mail 
client that's capable of handling large mailboxes?

Good Morning All,
I have PINE 3.91 on a Dec 3000 unix box with osf/1 V2.0.
Earlier this week MIS sent a large Zip file as an attachment.
It arrived with two extra obscene attachments.
I looked in the student's sent-mail folder and found at ~the same time,
an mail undelivered msg with the same mail as text.
It does not look intentional, but here in a Jesuit University the President
is quite upset.
Anyone else have a similiar experience?
Is it a 3.91 bug?

Thanks to All in advance,
RKJ

Suggestion: consider using an alternative format for your mail, such as
tenex format.  Read the Pine technical note for more information.  We long
ago gave up on mbox format for big mailboxes.  Some of our people have
tenex format mailboxes in the tens of megabytes.

Do you know how many messages are in your mailbox and have a general idea
of the sizes of messages?  Long ago, Pine would allocate a single 6MB
buffer (ala emacs) for your 6MB mailbox.  The problem was with malloc() 
implementations that would round up the request to the nearest power of
two, thus 6MB would become 8MB.  Pine now allocates buffers for each
message.  The problem is that some malloc() implementations do poorly with
that technique.

We are considering using a scratch file instead of a memory buffer; the
problem with doing that is that users run up against disk quotas and it's
slower.

Also, have you checked your per-process memory limits ("limit" command),
in particular the "datasize" and "memoryuse" values?  I, too, find it
difficult to believe that you could pop memory on your system with just a
6MB mailbox.

Hi,

I am using pine 3.9x as a very good mailer. I also am using a couple of
shell scripts to integrate with pgp using display and send filters. the
result is dead easy to use for someone who encrypts things occasionally
and signs them more often.

Having checked the several sites I could not find any scripts that use the
display filter process to do key managmenent, or any send filters that can
manage remailers (harder, I know). 

If soemone has such scripts, or can point me to such then I would be very
grateful. Ideally they should have the following features.
	On coming across a public key in a message it would add it
 (unverified, naturally) to your public key ring.
	On coming across a signed message for which you don't have the
public key for it should look up a key server and verify the signature.
        
If I get the time (studies permitting) I could write these but then I am a
novice script writer.

Regards,

Simon.

I use a combination oven to cook *8-)

BTW there is a lot in common between Email and News postings esp. on
mailing lists. At least from the user point of view.

I agree that pine is a poor news tool however why does this need to be
the case. rn wasn't, I like to think of it as dead *8-), exactly a
good News tool either hence the improved tools such as tin.

Pine is an email client it is there to make life easier when dealing
with email. Users tend to treat email and news in a similar manner
except one is more "public" than the other. If this last point
is wrong or correct but an example of the miss uses of pine/news
then fine but otherwise why not have one tool to do the "one" job
of news and email.

I myself don't care if pine does or doesn't handle news as well a tin
as long as it handled email well I'm happy.

Perhaps it would be a good idea to have a meta-FAQ posted to this group
(daily?) which points to this information.  It may help avoid the *large*
number of FAQ's this group sees.

Following up on my own message - I learned how to add a "Reply-To"
line to the customized header information.  I then renamed the config
file, so that I have a default config file and an alternate one.  If I
then start pine with the alternate config file (pine -p filename), I
can use the alternate email address as a Reply-To feature.  

New problem: In the Personal Name field, I can put in a new string
such as "Karen King (xxx@abc.com)" , exit and save configuration.
However, using that configuration, if I send myself a test message,
the From: line reads:
	From: "Karen King (xxx@zzz.com)" <krin@wam.umd.edu> <--- this
being the default address.
Is there anyway to tell the program to just show: From: Karen King
(xxx@zzz.com)?

Thanks in advance

Karen

OK, thanks for a well-argued response. As one who added some fuel I
want to say that I agree that an abstract integrate vs non-integrate
discussion in the end is not very productive. The tenor of my original
post was really that those who right now lack power-user news reader
features could turn to separate programs, instead of whining about
pine's news reader. And as Dana Booth rightly points out in her post,
users' demands vary greatly, there are those who are content as it is.

But (and here's no fuel now:-) one point. I was really talking about
the mail client's relative sluggishness, not the news reader's, which
I've never used. And surely it is important to keep an eye on pine's
big resource demands, to _economize_ routines in all possible ways,
not just to add features?

Holger,
I'm interested in the observation that Pine is sluggish.
My belief is that this is true in some configurations, but definitely not
true in general.  Some patterns I've observed:

 o Almost all of the "sluggishness" reports I've seen have come from
   folks using Sun systems.  Are you in that group?  If so, would
   one of the following items apply to you?

 o People who use Pine in IMAP mode are sometimes hosed when
   opening folders if the server has an rshd that doesn't respond
   quickly.  (Work around: add ":143" to the host specification.)

 o People with large inboxes who are using Bky "mbox" format *may*
   be hosed if they are using a system with limited memory or a
   slow virtual memory subsystem.  (Work around: use a different
   mailbox format and driver that doesn't read the whole folder
   into virtual memory.  Tenex format is one such alternative.)

Thoughts?

I don't want to add fuel to the flames of the morality of integrating new
and mail.  It's proven to be an unproductive discussion.

I will, however, say that the current state of newsreading in Pine is in
no way "final".  There are several new and quite exciting technologies
under development here.  A number of these pieces are starting to come
together, although it won't be obvious to the end user until the process
is finished. 

4.0 will probably not have any big changes in news reading.  However, 4.0
marks the introduction of some important underlying enabling technology.
You'll start seeing the benefits in subsequent versions. 

We know why Pine's current news reading is "slow and sluggish".  We can
fix it.  Pine gets the information for drawing the browser from the
message headers.  This information is used to build an "envelope", from
which Pine can do many things including draw a browser, do replies, and
build a filtered header. The envelope can also be used to thread, but that
requires getting envelopes for all messages which takes a while.

Most newsreaders take advantage of the unpublished XOVER extension in
NNTP.  XOVER is only suitable for drawing a browser and computing threads; 
you still have to get the headers to do anything else.  Also, not all NNTP
servers have XOVER; if you have the misfortune to use such a server you'll
discover how wretched tin performance will become.

We will use XOVER and have full news threading in a future version of
Pine.  We will also take advantage of the new NNTP extensions being
discussed now in the IETF; for example, the NNTP guys are adding
server-based searching that is quite similar to the capability that is in
IMAP.  We will certainly want to use server-based search if it is
available.  Our intent is not to match tin and other newsreaders.  Our
intent is to do better.

From my perspective, the claim that Pine should abandon news support
because dedicated newsreaders (such as tin) thread better is something
like the claim that these new-fangled automobiles should be abandoned
since horses are much more reliable than gasoline engines.  New
technologies are always vulnerable to unfavorable comparisons with
established technologies.  Just give it a chance to mature, OK?

I am using PC Pine and notice that if I leave the window open in background the green pine
tree will turn to a red tree when a new message comes in.  However, the tree remains red
until I exit completely and reenter.  Does anybody know how to toggle back to green without
exiting?

What causes it to be sent?  Is it necessary?  If not, how can it be

Hi, if you go to the address book, you can make a mailing list by putting
in the address field, several addresses seperated by commas. If you just
want to do a one time mailing, you can either put additional addresses in
the cc: field, or in the bcc: field.

Hope this helps...

CATALOGUE FORMAT CHOICES:

1.  19-Part email- can be read by EVERYONE (~353K Total).
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached text file ~334K - you
     must know how to download an attached text file and then be able to
     open it with your word processor.  If in doubt, don't ask for this
     version.  This isn't for internet *newbies.* Better to order option 1
     and spend a few minutes pasting them into one whole text document
     with your word processor, than to waste hours trying to figure how
     to deal with this option.
3.  For more advanced Macintosh computer users: compressed attached
     text file, created with a Stuffit(tm) self-extracting archive (.sea),
      ~187K.  Can be decompressed by any Macintosh computer user; no
     special expansion software or knowledge of Stuffit (tm) needed.  You
     just double-click on the file icon and it automatically expands
     (unstuffs). This is for more advanced mac computer users only, as
     you still have to know how to deal with an attached file.  It will cut
     your download time by 75%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in
     option #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be
     able to do.
4.  For expert computer users: compressed attached text file, created with
     Stuffit(tm),  ~161K.  Can be decompressed by any computer user who
     has expansion software to decompress (expand) Stuffit(tm) (.sit) files.
     This is for more advanced computer users only and will cut your
     download time by 78%.   Expands out to the same ~525K file in option
     #2.  See option #2 for more info on what you will need to be able to do.




VERY IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET A REPLY:

1.   you must call from an "unblocked number," ie. one that is not blocked
from caller id.  If you have a blocked number, you must first unblock it.
In most cases this means dialing *82 from a touch-tone phone (or 1182 from
a rotary phone) before you dial 1-718-227-9125.
2.   no reply forms can be accepted by email....only via fax or smail.
3.   faxes with cover pages will be rejected.  You must send *only* the
reply form.
4.   forms not *completely* filled in will not be acknowledged.
5.   you will receive a reply within 1 business day directly from the
company making the offer via email.  Therefore you must have an email
address.  If you read this message, then you must have an email address, or
access to one, at least.   :-)
6.   your fax must not exceed 1 page in length.   Faxes of 2 or more pages
will be sensed, then auto-terminated and deleted.  Your fax goes directly
onto our 5.0 gigabyte hard drive and we must limit all incoming faxes to 1
page.
7.   all faxes must begin with:
*------------cut here/begin-------------------------------------------*
and must end with:
*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*
8. Any fax not conforming to this format will be sensed by our software,
then auto-terminated and deleted from the hard drive, before any human ever
gets to see it.


WHO WE ARE:

Tempting Tear-Outs is an advertising company that brings potential new
customers to the companies they advertise for.

MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY MAKING THE FREE OFFER:

The company making the offer is a magazine subscription agency based in the
USA.  They have over 1,500 popular USA titles available to be shipped to
*any* country, including of course, to anywhere in the USA!    They offer a
FREE 1 yr. subscription to your choice of over 270 of the titles in their
catalogue to any new customer using them for the first time.       The
dollar value of the freebies, based on the subscription prices directly
from the publishers, ranges from $6.97 all the way up to $50.00!

For new customers in the USA, there is no charge for FPH (foreign postage &
handling), so the freebie is 100% free!   For new customers living
overseas, the only charge on the freebie would be for the FPH (foreign
postage & handling).

Their president has been in the magazine subscription business since 1973
and they are very customer-service oriented.   They will even help you with
address changes on your magazines, even if you move from one country to
another country.   They have thousands of happy customers in over 59
countries.

Their price guarantee is very simple:       they guarantee that their
subscription prices are the lowest available and they will BEAT any
legitimate, verifiable offer before you pay them or match it afterwards, by
refunding you the difference in price PLUS the cost of the postage stamp
you would use sending in the special offer to them, even 6 months after you
pay them, as long as it was current at the time of your offer.    Does that
sound fair?       Wouldn't it be great if everything you bought came with
that price guarantee?

Sometimes they are less than half of the next best deal out there,
sometimes just a little cheaper, but always you get the lowest rates
without having to shop around.     With 1,500 titles on their list, they
would like to think that they have also the best selection around!

Within the USA, for their USA customers, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.         The 1 yr. freebie that you get with your first order is
completely free!

Overseas, (even after you factor in the cost of the FPH (foreign postage &
handling) and the conversion from USA Dollars to your currency), on the
average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of what the
newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some titles they
are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They are also
the cheapest subscription source for delivery overseas, including directly
from the publishers themselves!   Some publishers don't even offer
subscriptions overseas.........but overseas subscriptions are this
company's specialty!  They feel that magazines should not be a luxury
overseas.   In the USA, people buy magazines and then toss them after
reading them for just a few minutes or hours.  They are so cheap in the
USA!   Well, this company would like to make it the same way for their
overseas members.  They are also cheaper than all their competitors in the
USA and overseas, including the publishers themselves!   It is also *highly
unlikely* you will find any of their USA competitors calling you overseas,
in order to offer that personal touch, just to sell you a couple of
magazines!  But that is what this company specializes in and loves doing!
Around one-half their business comes from overseas, so they are very
patient with new members who only speak limited English as a 2nd language.
Subscription prices quoted for overseas consist of the subscription
price, plus the FPH.   You add the two together and that is your total
cost.   The exception is the 1 yr. freebie you get with your first order.
On that title, you pay *only* the FPH for the 1 yr. term.

Their prices are so cheap because when you deal with them, you cut-out all
the middlemen.


HERE IS HOW YOU CAN GET MORE INFO AND GET STARTED WITH THEM:

Simply fax or smail back to us the reply form listed at the top of this
message.   We will then forward your form on to the subscription agency.
They will then email their "big and juicy" catalogue to you, in whichever
of the four formats you chose.   The catalogue is FREE and makes for hours
of fascinating reading, on its own. It includes the complete list of
freebies, a complete list of all the titles they sell, as well as detailed
descriptions on most of the titles, along with lists of titles by category
of interest.

They will then give you a friendly, no-pressure, no obligation, 5-minute
call to go over how they work and to answer any questions that you might
have, as well as give you up-to-the minute price quotes on any titles you
might be considering.     They will call you in whatever country you live
in, taking the time difference into account.        As they like to
emphasize the personal touch they give to each new customer, all first-time
orders can only be done via phone, so they can answer all your questions
completely and personally.   Once you have placed your first order via
phone, you will be able to place future orders and make inquiries on your
account, get price quotes, etc., all via email, if that is most convenient
for you.

Within the USA, they accept payment via check over the phone, Mastercard,
Visa and American Express.      Overseas, they accept Mastercard, Visa and
American Express, even if your credit card is a local one in local
currency!

That's our introduction of our client that we represent.   We hope that we
have piqued your interest and that you will take the next step to get their
free catalogue!   Thank you for your time and interest.

I believe that your question is effectively is it ok to use Bcc (or pine's
Lcc).

I think the answer is clearly yes.  Imagine the following.

A sends memo (on paper) to B and A retains a copy herself.
A may at anytime show to some third party, C, possibly A's boss a copy
of the memo.

If you have no ethical problem with this, then you should have no
ethical problem with Bcc.  It is the same, only you do it with
fewer steps.  Since you can always retain a copy of anything you
send and then send a copy of your copy to any third party, Bcc also
adds little new, except for convenience.

Furthermore, there are cases where Bcc is the ethical thing to do.
There are people who don't want their email address made public.  Bcc
is useful for that.

I do think the question you raise is an important one, and would like
to see other opinions on this matter.  Basically, while I think my answer
makes sense, I am not fully satisfied with it, but I don't understand why.

 
Also Should be move this discussion from c.m.pine to c.m.misc?

-jeff

    By "the list" do you mean the procmail mailing list, where such
questions are dealt which in depth?  If not, that is where your question
really belongs, because this is the Pine newsgroup, not a procmail
group.  People here may in fact use procmail, but because this is not a
procmail group you may or may not get a knowledgeable answer to your

Dear Pine developers,

I had an idea that might be of use.  Sometimes I
accidentally delete a letter and because I have 
become so used to the prompts and answer them 
so quickly, I sometimes end up deleting the file
even though I'm asked if I really want to do
this.  Could pine encorporate a "waste-basket" or
a "file 13" that would collect all of these 
discarded letters just to be safe? It could 
delete the file periodically so at least you
would have a chance to recover the file.

The idea is like this. Say there were two waste
files - "File-13" and "File-14".  When PINE
starts up, it would delete one of these files,
say "File-13".  When it closes, it would move all
deleted files to the now emptied "File-13".  The
next time Pine started, it would delete "File-14"
and when it closed it would move all deleted
files to "File-14". With this strategy, if I made
a mistake and wanted to restore one of the
letters that I had deleted, I would have at least
one last chance to move that letter back into one
of my save files. BTW, you needn't make this
option so transparent - it could be incorporated
in a "Restore Lost Letters" command.

What do you think? Cheers, John

     You can install `procmail' on the ISP's system (hard disk) and use
     it with `pine'. `procmail' allows you to (among other things)
     presort mail into separate folders. You can set up `pine' to use the
     same folders.

     eg: all mail from the Ibrowse (a W3 client) mailing list gets put
     into a folder called "ibrowse" within my ~/.mailbox dir (my
     ~/.mailbox dir is where incoming mail is stored - not in
     /usr/spool/mail/$USER). I then set up `pine''s Incoming Folders
     option to add the folder "~/.mailbox/ibrowse" (nicknamed it
     Ibrowse). 

     Hope this helps some (and if it didn't, let me know...)

To add custom headers to Pine:

1.  Start Pine

2.  Go to the Setup Configuration screen ("S" then "C" at the Main Menu)

3.  Look down list of options for "customized-hdrs".

4.  Put cursor on this option and ask Pine for help by typing "?".

Why switch?  If you are on a windowing computer you should be able to have
both pine and a real newsreader open at the same time.  I run Solaris 2.x
and always have pine open in an xterm in the lower right hand corner.  I
usually read news with nn in an xterm right above it.  You could do
something similar with telnet on Windoze or MuckOS.  When I am logged in
from my ancient DOS laptop from the road I use shell job control to have them
both running and switch back and forth using that mechanism so that I do not
have to stop or start either one.

I maintain nn, tin, elm and pine at my site.  I use nn and pine.  Many of my
users really like pine for reading news when they first start out, but
almost any of them who become familiar with the feature set of nn or tin
switch to one of those for reading news.  The real news power users seem to
prefer nn.

I think if the pine team would ignore all requests for enhancement of the
news features and concentrate on keeping pine the best MUA I have used the
world would truly be a better place.  I think efforts to make it rival nn,
trn, tin, etc. are ill-placed and ill-considered.  Leave news there for the
non power user, but don't do anything except fix egregious bugs.

If you have a really fast, easy-to-use newsreader, threads and advanced
killfile features are not the most important thing.  I dislike reading news
with tin almost as much as I dislike reading news with pine or netscape.
I have been reading news several hours a day since the late 80's and there
is nothing else that allows me to wade through 1000 or more newsposts that
might accumulate in the groups I read regularly in a couple of days away
than nn.

John

Seems to me the proposed enhancement is to accomodate the symptom
of a problem rather than attacking - and eliminating - the cause of it.

The solution to your problem may lie in the first para below. Are the
prompts not designed properly? How can that aspect be improved to reduce
or eliminate unintended deletions?

I too receive a lot (?) of mail (200-300 messages/day) but have not 
experienced the problem you described.

OK, I fixed the error message.  I had a permissions problem on the mail
queue.

I still have a problem sending mail:
None of my mail will go outside the firewall.  I need to figure out a
way to direct my outgoing mail there.  No problem with incoming.  No
problem sending mail inside the firewall.

Anyone done this before?

Thanks,
Nicole

Pine's news support is not a significant amount of code, and the code that
is specifically for news is shrinking.

This statement makes less sense than you think.

To support IMAP4, we must support hierarchical names, subscriptions, and
UID management. That's most of what constitutes Pine's news support.  The
code that babbles NNTP is very small and shrinking -- it's just 2/3 the
size in Pine 4.0 (less than 32K now) that it was in Pine 3.95.

In terms of what would be added to support news, we want threading for
mail too.  In fact, because of IMAP4 support it's hard to think of much
that is news-specific at all, other than the NNTP code and recognition of
Newsgroups:, Followup-To:, and References: headers.

Chuck,
I'm not sure I understand your question, but: if your Unix machine is
running an IMAP server, PC-Pine can probably get at any of your folders
stored on the Unix machine... whereupon you can ask PC-Pine to store a
message locally, or in a different folder on the IMAP server.

I am testing the use of a global address book with about 650 entries
(nickname, full name, and address).  Each time I call up the address book,
or each time I space a page down in it, PC-Pine V3.95 spends about 10 - 15
seconds accessing the file.  I have tried moving the file from a server
directory to the local pc.  I have insured that the LU file is created and
even tried setting it as read-only.  I have tried sorting the file and
matching the address sort pinerc entry to be the same. However, the file
access seems to keep going on.  

Any ideas?

Subject: Undiagnosed "extract" failures when disk quota exceeded
Date: 19 Nov 1996 21:59:13 GMT
Message-ID: <56tajh$1iv@News.Dal.Ca>

  Using Pine 3.95 on AIX 4.1.4 with disk quotas enabled:

  A user reported that a file was destroyed when he attempted to extract a
message and append it to the file and in doing so exceeded his disk quota.
When I looked at the file, a 600K+ pre-destruction copy of which was in our
backup system, it had a size of zero.  
  I have not been able to duplicate this exactly, but I ran into an
alternate problem.
  I created a test file and set my quota down to within a few blocks of my
current disk usage.  I then repeated extracted a message of about 800 bytes
and appended it to the test file.  When I reached the disk quota I got a
message at the bottom of the screen that the extract operation had failed.
This is fine, and the test file was intact-ish: the original data was there
plus part of the message being extracted.  I'm not actually over quota; AIX
says I'm within one block of it:

Disk quotas for user ae (uid 4708): 
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
          /home   46522       0   46523            4198       0       0        

  I then attempted another extract of the about 800 bytes file, specified to
append to the test file, and was told that the append had succeeded.
However, the test file was unchanged.
  I did an extract to a new file, and was also told that it had succeeded.
The file had been created, but was empty.

Hi all,

I solaris 2.5.1 running on both my workstation and the mail server. 
IMAP used to work so that I did not have to login again (Pre-Auth?). 
Now all of a sudden, this does not work and I get the errormessage 

[Can't connect to tau,143: Connection refused]

There are two other workstations that still work fine.  I tried:
1.  rsh to server and exec /etc/rimapd:  OK
2.  telnet to server at 143:             FAIL
3.  telnet to server:                    OK

(See below.)


My home directory is local to my workstation and gets mapped to
/home/harry via auto_home.  This is true of the mail server as well.
	
What could have changed, or more importantly what should I try next.

Subject: IMAP and 3.95 with multiple accounts?
Date: 15 Nov 1996 21:13:40 GMT
Message-ID: <56ime4$phu@vixen.cso.uiuc.edu>

I'm looking at the IMAP server and pine, and was wondering this:  I have 
a unix client of pine, I'd like to contact a remote IMAP server and have
one folder as one user, the other folder as another.  My goal is to have 
one client that is able to read other mail, like manager mail, but just as
another folder.

I can get by this, by not using the .rhosts files for either username, but 
would rather it just advertise itself as the other user, so that no passowrds
would need to be involved.

Anyone know if this is possible?  The only info I see only lets you 
give a remote host and folder name, not a user name, per folder...

Thanks,
Mike

Hello all,

I've opened a Linux server with of course Pine as mail reader.
I'm asking me if there is a mean to use the PGP encode programm with
Pine. If yes, how ?, and with wich program, and where to find it...?
I'm new to this matter (pgp)... Or is there any FAQ on PGP....?
Thanks a lot.

I have a problem and can't seem to find an answer to it.
I have a unix shell account with pine installed and i also have a PPP
account for which i have Eudora 3.0.  When i have Eudora get my mail from
my unix shell it deletes it from Pine,... which is a bad bad thing.  I
already lost like 2 work emails becuase of this.
The simple fix is never to use Eudora but i'm sure there has to be a
better answer.. I couldn't find anything in the settings in Eudora,.. I'm
thinking maybe the answer is in Pine,...
I dunno,....

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.
I'm ready to offer my firstborn, a pint or 2 of my blood or a nonessential
organ for a fix to this..
Thanks in advance,.... if you could also email me the answer-- i don't
                       really check the newsgroups that much

At Victoria Freenet we're using Pine 3.91 with Pico. 

I would like to know if Pine supports any alternate character sets suich
as Cryllic (sp?) or Korean, Chinese, or Japanese character sets. If Pine
does support some other character sets what additional software is needed
and does that software have to be provided on the server or on the user's
machine?

My experience has been that once you read the article, delete it like you
would anyother piece of mail. Doing this I have had no problems.

Joke:> 
                              MATH KNOWLEDGE


   Two mathematicians were having dinner in a restaurant, arguing about
   the average mathematical knowledge of the American public. One
   mathematician claimed that this average was woefully inadequate, the
   other maintained that it was surprisingly high.

   "I'll tell you what," said the cynic, "ask that waitress a simple math
   question. If she gets it right, I'll pick up dinner. If not, you do."
   He then excused himself to visit the men's room, and the other called
   the waitress over.

   "When my friend comes back," he told her, "I'm going to ask you a
   question, and I want you to respond `one third x cubed.' There's
   twenty bucks in it for you." She agreed.

   The cynic returned from the bathroom and called the waitress over.
   "The food was wonderful, thank you," the mathematician started.
   "Incidentally, do you know what the integral of x squared is?"

   The waitress looked pensive; almost pained. She looked around the
   room, at her feet, made gurgling noises, and finally said, "Um, one
   third x cubed?"

   So the cynic paid the check. The waitress wheeled around, walked a few
   paces away, looked back at the two men, and muttered under her breath,
   "...plus a constant."

Nope, according to Dave Miller (one of Pine's authors), not at this
time (Pine 3.95).  I had asked him this question as an aside in some
emails we were exchanging about some other topic.

 I, too, would like to see the reply-to string user-customizable. (Sigh...)

Subject: bug: tenex folders & folder indices
Date: 22 Nov 1996 21:45:18 GMT
Message-ID: <5756te$47e@sobolev.rhein.de>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In one of the discussions here, Pine development people suggested to
use the tenex format for big incoming mail folders.  To check things
out, I created a ~/mail.txt file; pine immediately started to make it
a tenex format incoming folder.

Things seemed to work fine - but there is one problem: I have my
messages sorted by the date they were *sent*.  Now, pine doesn't seem
to keep incoming folder's index display in sync with the messages, so
if I try to display message A, I am presented with message B, while
message A will show up one or more times at different points of the
folder index, with still other messages hiding behind it.

I'd consider this a serious problem, since I'm almost certain that
I've been deleting mails I didn't want to delete due to this.  I've
returned to the traditional unix-style folder whose handling doesn't
seem to have this »feature«..

While we are on it: There seems to be a small but annoying bug in the
MIME display code.  While displaying a text attachment, pine will show
it properly when I scroll by hitting the space bar.  But when I use
the cursor keys to move downward in the message, an empty line is
being inserted between every two lines of text.

	I'm not sure what you mean by a "math file".  However, if you 
mean that it is something other than simple text, I would suggest using 
uuencode.  If you had a file called "math" in your unix homedirectory, 
you could proceed as follows:

1. At the unix prompt, type:  uuencode math math > math.uu

This will yield a new file called math.uu, which is a uuencoded version 
of your original file.  The second "math" in the command line just 
indicates that when math.uu is uudecoded by the recipient, the decoded 
file will be called "math".  The "> math.uu" is needed to direct the 
output to the file math.uu.  Without this, the output will just scroll by 
on the screen.

2.  A uuencoded file is ascii text, and so can be read into an e-mail 
message with CTRL-R.  Alternatively, you can send it as an attachment 
(CTRL-J).

3.  The recipient will have to either (E)xport the message or (S)ave the 
attachment to his/her unix homedirectory.  Then after quitting PINE, they 
need to type:  uudecode math.uu

I hope this answers your question.

In sending Binary Attachments from Pine for OpenVMS (3.91 - PMDF V5.0) to
non-OpenVMS Hosts the Name used is the full VMS Path looking something
like:

     DISK?:<USERID>FILENAME.;N

All these special characters make the filename "invalid" for many
non-OpenVMS receiving E-mail Applications!  Is there a way for Pine to
use just the FINENAME portion, as UNIX versions of Pine would do?

Hi,
 
I have PINE 3.95 installed on SCO ODT 3.0. I login in SCO using
dial-up connection. Sometimes when i am composing message a connection
is broken. After resetting dial-up connection i am trying continue
to compose message and i see pine saying " Use compose command to
contunue interrupted message". I use compose command but receive
pine message "Empty folder. No messages really postponed!"
 
It's interesting that on other platforms for example Solaris 2.4, Irix 5.3
interrupted message is saved and i can continue to compose message.
 
 Any ideas ?
 
 Thanks.

Take five minutes to read this and it WILL change your life.
 
 The Internet has grown tremendously. It doubles in size every 4 months.
 think about it. You see those 'Make.Money.Fast' posts more and more.
 That's ... because it WORKS !  So I thought, all those new users might
 make it work. And I decided to try it out, a few months ago.  Besides,
 whats $5.00, I spend more than that in the morning on my way to work on
 coffee and cigs for the day. So I sent in my money and posted.
 Everyone was calling it a scam, but there are SO many new users from
 AOL, Netcom, etc. they will join in and make it work for you.

 Well, two weeks later, I began recieving bucks in the mail!  I couldn't
 believe it! Not just a little, I mean big bucks!  At first only a few
 hundred dollars, then a week later, a couple of thousand, then BOOM. By
 the end of the fourth week, I had recieved nearly $47,000.00. It came
 from all over the world. And every bit of it perfectly legal and on the
 up and up. I've been able to pay off all my bills and still had enough
 left over for a nice vacation for me and my family.

 Not only does it work for me, it works for other folks as well.  Markus
 Valppu says he made $57,883 in four weeks. Dave Manning claims he made
 $53,664 in the same amount of time. Dan Shepstone says it was only
 $17,000 for him. Do I know these folks? No, but when I read how they
 say they did it, it made sense to me. Enough sense that I'm taking a
 similar chance with $5 of my own bucks. Not a big chance, I admit--but
 one with incredible potential, because $5 is all anyone ever invests in
 this system. Period. That's all Markus, Dave, or Dan invested, yet
 their $5 netted them tens of thousands of dollars each, in a safe,
 legal, completely legitimate way. Here's how it works in 3 easy steps:

STEP 1.

Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate pieces
of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST." (In
this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone; you're paying for
a legitimate service.) Fold a $1 bill, money order, or bank note inside
each paper, and mail them by standard U. S. Mail to the following five
addresses:

 1-  Fern Suarez
     Mallorca 112
     Hato Rey, P.R., USA, 00917
 
 2-  Philippe
     2104 De Mexico
     Chomedey, Laval
     Quebec, Canada     
     H7M 3C6    
     
 3-  Natalie Jansen
     Lancveldlaan 18
     5671 CN Nuenen
     Holland
  
 4-  Chad Collier
     2785 Cold Springs Rd. #49
     Placerville, CA  95667  

 5-  Steve Boltinghouse
     1009 Bird St.
     Hannibal, MO  63401

STEP 2.

    Now remove the top name from the list, and move the
    other names up.This way, #5 becomes #4 and so on.
    Put your name in as the fifth one on the list.


STEP 3.

    Post the article to at least 250 newsgroups. There are at
    least 19000 newsgroups at any given moment in time.
    Try posting to as many newsgroups as you can. Remember
    the more groups you post to, the more people will see your
    article and send you cash!


STEP 4.

    You are now in business for yourself, and should start seeing
    returns within 7 to 14 days! Remember, the Internet is new
    and huge. There is no way you can lose.
 
    Now here is how and why this system works:
 
    Out of every block of 250 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.
 
    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 250
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings. On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!
 
    Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 250 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!
 
    Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.
 
    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

		The end result depends on you. You must follow through
		and repost this article everywhere you can think of.
		The more  postings you  make, the more cash ends up in
		your mailbox. It's too easy and too cheap to pass up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it. Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily. Try to keep
    an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

    If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
    for real, then don't do it. But please print this article and pass it
    along to someone you know who really needs the bucks, and see
    what happens.


    REMEMBER....HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.YOU DON'T
    NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE THE BUCKS!
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL, AND PLEASE PLAY FAIR AND YOU WILL
    WIN AND MAKE SOME REAL INSTANT FREE CASH!

*** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the bucks to the people
already included, you will not get much. I know someone who did this
and only got about $150 (and that's after two months). Then he sent
the 5 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had
over $10,000!

		TRY IT AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY!!!  :o) !!!!!!!!!!

Because, presumably, you know who sent posts that you sent.  It's 
there to give you information which should be more useful than
your own name.

Makes more sense in a mail folder.  Take a look at your sent-mail
folder - you'll see the addresses you sent mail to, instead of
your own name umpty-gazillion times.  Convenient, no?

I have found this most useful when broadcasting a messagfe to a large
group of people in our company.  If I send a message to a list called
"os" in our global address book it will go to about 80 people.  Paging
through 80 addresses to get to the message is a real pain.  In our
organization I encourage people to use bcc and then make it clear in the
beginning of the message who it was sent to so that people don't start
bouncing the message all over the place thinking "Gee, I'll bet Ramesh
would love to see this message.  I wonder if he got it.  I'll forward it
to him just in case."  I add something like this to the tops of my
broadcast messages:

===============================================
THIS MESSAGE WAS SENT TO ALL OUTSIDE SALES REPS

I have been experiencing problems with the pine program.  Any time a
control key is required for a command nothing happens.  Also my e-mail
inbox is stuck in what is called "read-only" mode and I cannot delete
messages.  I have tried reading all of the help files and I have tried
reconfiguring but to no avail.

This "PINE" program is very cumbersome and difficult to use.  It has a lot
of bugs and does not seem to interface at all with MS Windows.  It appears
and acts like a program that was written many years ago.  Is there not any
program that is more up to date and user friendly that I could use.

Thanks for your help.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

This is a well-known problem which the Pine development team definitely
is aware of. (I submitted this as Bug (ID RE3IB) and got an according
reply from David L Miller <dlm@cac.washington.edu>.)

So there's hope that this will get fixed in 4.00...

Ciao,

    Your question doesn't really have anything to do with Pine at all. 
Pine does not do anything to affect the physical appearance of your
display.  That is totally controlled by the hardware and software of
whatever you are using.  Considering that there are at least 49,230,156
possible combinations :-) of display hardware and software, we can't
really help you much without detailed information on your setup, and
again, it doesn't really have anything to do with Pine.  If you are
affiliated with an organization, institution, or school, I would
suggest checking with the help desk or computing center, if there is
one.

Hi, there,

    I had a problem with pine which gives me the following message when
running,

    "can't open mailbox lock, access is readonly".

    Now I can't delete mails from my mailbox. However I can still 
use the "mail" program to delete my incoming mail.

    I searched on the FAQ of the pine but can't locate the answer.

    Any suggestions? 

    Thanks,

_I_ would like to see the reply-indent-string _less_ so. Just look at

Try http://pgp.rivertown.net/  It's run by the PGP-Users mailing list
maintainer/owner.  I recommend (and use) mkpgp2.1 for Linux+Pine+PGP.  Take
the link on the first page on pgp.rivertown.net, or you can ftp it at
ftp://ftp.rivertown.net/pub/unix/privacy/mkpgp2.1.tar.gz

If you add each folder to the incoming folder collections, you can do
something like this:

incoming-folders="INBOX #1" {mail.imapserv.org/user=user1}INBOX,
	"INBOX #2" {mail.imapserv.org/user=user2}INBOX,
	"INBOX #3" {mail.imapserv.org/user=user3}INBOX

I've done it before over here under Linux with Pine and the IMAP server
running on the same machine, and it worked fine...

With the above, you're still the same person that you started Pine with, and
it will prompt you for a password for each user's inbox.  To read and write
mail for that username, your best bet is to login as that person.  Even if
you were to use fetchmail (formerly popclient) to 'fetch' mail for multiple
accounts, you would need multiple .pinerc's for the correct return address.

That would be a nice feature of a future version of Pine, to be able to
change From: tags from within Pine.  I used to use that _all the time_ with
timEd, way back when, when I was running a FidoNet BBS.


So, the condensed answer to your question is: not that I know of.

There is a setting in Eudora to "leave mail on server".  I'm running Linux
right now so I can't check Eudora itself (without rebooting and booting
Win), but in the eudora.ini there is a setting LeaveMailOnServer.

[Settings]
<SNIP>
LeaveMailOnServer=1
Sound=0
AutoReceiveAttachmentsDirectory=C:\FILES

If you're not running Eudora, load it up with a text editor and change it to
LeaveMailOnServer=1.  That way Eudora won't delete the mail, and you can
still read it with Pine later.

Thats ok, I have plenty of blood and organs, and don't need another
firstborn ;-)  Do you have any extra Pentium systems lying around?  ;-)

I don't know about 3.91, I'm using 3.95, but the setting is "character-set"
and it's toward the end of the setup|config menu.  Leaving it blank uses
US-ASCII.  Check the help (hit ? on that setting) for more info about which
character sets it supports.

Hello,

I was wondering if there is an escape character I can use to escape the
',' that seperates different customizable headers in PINE 3.95?

I have an header I would like to add which contains ','s but the header
gets treated as seperate headers.

something like '\,' would be nice =)'

Does such a character exist?

Other than that.. Great Mailer.

    Your question is really about procmail, not about Pine, so I 
would suggest fielding it to the procmail mailing list, not the
Pine newsgroup.

Hi,

	I started using pine 3.95 version only today and I have a problem with that. 
When I activate the pine program I want to view the messages of INBOX directly. I'm unable to
do that. It is going to the main menu directly. 

	Can we read the messages of the INBOX directly  after invoking pine ?? Can someone help me...

Cheers,
Bharath Kumar.

Hi,

	I have a query. Suppose I am out-of-station I would like to send a reply to all the senders 
the information that I'm out.

	So, can we send a message whenever we receive one using Pine.

Thanx,
Bharath Kumar.

no way caused by tenex format.  Sorting is done entirely within the Pine
main program and the lower-level tenex code has nothing to do with it.
The interface between tenex and the main program is identical to the
interface between standard UNIX format and the main program; and at this
level there is no such thing as "sorting".

I have heard rumors of sorting problems, but since it's in another
programmer's area I don't know the details.

Please report as many details of the problem as you can to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.

Ummm... I'm a little confused by your message as you appear first to say
that pre-authenticated IMAP connections are failing, and then in your list
of three things you tried said that it (1) worked.

Anyway here's a few things for you to check out and try:

Note: When "143" is mentioned this is referring to the default (*NOT*
pre-authenticated) IMAP connection.  This corresponds with you saying that
telnet-ing to port 143 fails, below.

Here's one problem, that is blocking your connection when telnet-ing to
port 143...  The keyword (the first word on the line) must be the same in
the entries in the two files so as to provide the "link" between them.

In particular you have "imap" in /etc/services and "rimap" in
/etc/inetd.conf as the first word on each line.  Change the latter to be
"imap" (it has nothing at all to do with the pre-authenticated IMAP stuff:
/etc/rimapd).

Then either reload the inetd server by sending it the appropriate signal,
or reboot your machine.

> strata% rsh tau exec /etc/rimapd
> TERM: Undefined variable.
> * PREAUTH tau IMAP2bis Service 7.8(92) at Wed, 20 Nov 1996 10:30:11
> -0500 (EST)

And the "TERM: Undefined variable." is quite likely to be causing problems
with pre-authenticated connections.  The "* PREAUTH ..." line should be
the very first thing you see then you try rsh'ing to the server and
executing /etc/rimapd.

This will be coming from either your own or the systemwide shell startup
file (eg, for csh either /etc/cshrc or your own ~/.login or ~/.cshrc
files).

Some commands can't be meaningfully given in a plain "rsh server command"
environment, and should be executed only after performing some sort of
test (eg, testing if TERM is set perhaps in this case, or if the prompt
variable is set (signifying an interactive session)).

Cheers,

Probably you have to change the permission of the directory where INBOXes
are stored (system-dependent: e.g. directory /var/mail, permission= 1777,
user=root, group=mail)

If you and the recipient are using Pine or Netscape or any other MUA which
is MIME-compatible attach your file without uu-encoding as "attachment"
(see the header while creating your mail). Then the recipient's MUA
decodes the attached file to the original.

I just had the same problem. Go into your .pinerc (in your $HOME 
directory) and search for the folder name you just created. Just delete 
the folder name. Seems to me I got the name of the folder twice, once in 
quotes and once not. You have to delete them both (I think one was the 
'nickname' I gave it). Hope this is as simple for you as it was for me 
(after much scratching of head). I'm *still* trying to figure out how to 
use 'filter' in order to make use of those folders.

My ISP doesn't have procmail available, and I'm not sure how to compile 
so... I'm so glad I have extra time.

An even easier way to go straight into the INBOX index screen is to start
Pine with the "-i" command line option:

	pine -i

Thanks a lot, Rudolf,

    I have solved the problem by chance. It's similar to what you 
expected. I found out the /tmp directory is no longer writable by the 
users, I changed it and it solve the problem.

    Best regards,

    Even though you seem to have posted using tin, if you are referring
to a recent version of Pine, check your configuration to see if you have
"disable-keymenu" (going from memory) toggled on.  If it is, the
commands will not appear at the bottom of the screen unless you press 
? or ^G as the case may be.  Toggle it off if you want the commands to
appears all the time.

There are at least three well known methods.  You can find one in my web
page at this URL:

   http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html

This is the least complicated way, IMHO.  Others are more complicated and
more sophisticated.  Enough said!

    One possible use would be if you are a moderator of a moderated
newsgroup and have to approve articles before posting them.  Some
moderated groups have multiple moderators, and people like to know 
who approved which messages.

I am using pine 3.91 for VMS. Is there anyway I can configure it so that 
when people reply to my messages they are not sent back to the account 
from which i sent them? If so how?

thanks in advance

My problem revolves around the sent-mail folder.  Often times, a user's
sent-mail folder becomes rather large because no one regularly deletes
sent-mail.  I know that Pine prompts for the user to delete sent-mail
messages older than a month but very few of our users opt for this because
they are afraid they will lose ALL of their messages.  I've discovered how
to automatically purge sent-mail messages but that is a little extreme in 
our situation.  My question is: is there any way to automatically delete
only the sent-mail messages that are older than one month?  Thank you very
much for your time!

Well, it looks like you're using Pine from a Linux box, so you can use this
shell command if you're at the console:

setterm -inversescreen on

Most remote terminals won't understand what to do with that, but you can try
it anyway.  Other than that, it depends on the settings that might be in the
terminal or emulator you're using to log in.

Subject: Pilot as full-fledged Menu system?

Are there any plans to turn Pilot into a more full-featured Unix-based
menu system?

Pilot is a fine file tree browser and program-runner, but the capability
of adding global and user-configurable menus would be a boon.  In our
environment, at least, not all users have graphical network access,
but would nonetheless like to see something more friendly upon login
than a Unix prompt (I speak as a great fan of the Unix prompt, but not
all of our users share my enthusiasm.)

Subject: PINE procmail interface?

I think that many of us have either wondered, or had users ask us, "how
can I set up mail filtering from PINE?"

As most of us know, this is a function of separate filtering software,
of which PROCMAIL is probably the best example.

However, I suspect that most PINE users (particularly PC-PINE users who
don't normally log into Unix) are not up to creating and maintaining
.procmailrc files for themselves.

Has the PINE project considered adding a procmail editing interface to
PINE?  (Not that they don't already have a full plate...)

I'd love to be able to tell folks they can create filtering themselves
via PINE.  Eudora Pro does this, though of course at the local PC,
whither their mail is slurped via the (yech) POP protocol.

Alternatively, does anyone know of any menu- or GUI-based interfaces to
procmail (other than the Project project at Cal Poly?)

I can see creating a WWW-based interface for this, but it would require
an HTTP process on the server where procmail runs.  I can also see the
potential for some serious security holes if such a thing were not
written carefully.

If our users could set up a .procmailrc on the server from within PINE,
it would be most useful.  I'd be willing to volunteer for some work on
this, if the PINE Project were interested.

How do you configure pine to work with more than 1 news collections?

I've managed to put 2 news collections in my setup (under the section on
news collections) but when I subscribe to a newsgroup, it appears on both
collections. if I try to delete from 1 collection, it becomes removed from
both. 

Thanks

    Well, one step toward a solution is already available.  It's call
"self discipline when replying."  I have noticed that many people quote
far too much when they reply or followup than is really necessary to
get their point across.  Yes, some context is often necessary and is
sometimes more conveniently quoted than paraphrased or summarized, but
I have rarely seen a post with qotations 43 levels deep that was really
worth the effort it took to figure it out, even when people used
different quotation strings.

    However, Pine allows one to use some other editor than the Pine
built-in composer, a VERY valuable feature (the built-in composer
drives me nuts), so your suggestion would have no applicability to
people who use other editors (although most _decent_ editors allow one
to set a line width by default, which accomplishes the same thing).

> And while I'm on the soap box, people need to use proportional fonts too. 

    Uh, why, please should people use proportional fonts?  My
observation has been that people who use proportional fonts often tend
to violate the very principle of maximum line width you were referring
to above.  And proportional fonts are not practical or even feasible
for a lot of people when they are composing news and/or mail.

For a future version of pine, would like to
see the control-z feature modified so when it's executed it doesn't
clear the screen.  Not all of us have screen and shell out to run a web
browser, would be nice to have the urrl still on the screen as
we're typing it in for reference.

Second request, trash the your display is set for us ascii
the message is in iso 8059 some characters may be displayed
incorrectly message.  That's a given.  Why not put an option
in for this which would read auto, and when invoked
if the software on a site would allow iso 8059 display to
happen simply switch to iso 8059 display.  You might have a country
selection in configuration so users could identify where pine
was being used at and thereby set a default
display to switch back to when message display was over.

    Please do not do this.  It may look catchy, but it can cause
SERIOUS problems for some people.  Whether or not it works depends
totally on the hardware and software the recipient has.  You have no
control over this.  The technique (usually, at least) depends on
imbedded, non-standard control characters which can wreak havoc on
some recipients' terminals and personal computers.  It's a very bad
idea.  Please avoid picking up bad habits.

I get this when I shell out of Pine and start a new copy.  The new copy will
only run in 'Read-Only' mode.  Try quitting out of Pine and typing fg at the
prompt.   If that doesn't work, log out and try again.

  At the main menu of pine, type 's' for setup and then 'c' for config. 
In the list of options there you will come across an option called 'nntp 
server..'. There you add 'news.vsnl.net.in'
  To access the newsgroups, press 'l' for list of folders.

  Happy newsgrouping, Dinesh.

It still is bad programming; the proper way to do a non-blocking connect is
to retry the connect you eitehr get an already connected error or
a timeout.

But it is a bug in Solaris 2.x, we can agree on that.

I'm not sure, but wouldn't be entirely suprised if POSIX standards allowed
a read of 0 to return 0 always and immediately on any valid fd.

Subject: ipop3d NOT allowing 'Leave mail on server'
Date: 26 Nov 1996 08:53:32 GMT
Message-ID: <57eb6c$3q7@chaos.kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be>

Hello,

I wonder if it is possible to compile ipop3d (we use 3-6), so that
it is not possible for Eudora users to set 'Leave mail on server'.
If too much of our Eudora users do this, our 2G /var/spool/mail
will get full.

We use at another place another pop server which does not allow this,
but this pop server has problems with locked mailboxes, so I like to use
the POP server of the imap distribution because most of our users use
Pine.

Thanks,

-Herman-

Hello.  I am wondering if you can tell me how to talk to people at other
places.  For instance, I am at Northwestern Michigan College.  I would
like to be able to talk to my friends at other colleges around the state
of Michigan.  Is there a certain command that I need to type?  I know how
to have a "conversation" with people here at NMC, but not elsewhere.  Can
you help?!

Thank you*

Hello All,
We have Pine 3.91 on Dec 3000 osf/1 V2.0.
Recently mail was sent with a large zip file attachment
It arrived with two extra attachments
I looked up the person who had sent it and it had an unknown address 
It looks like the user had not done this intentionally.
Anyone else have this problem of unwanted attachments?
Is this a known bug of 3.91?

Thanks in advance!
RKJ

Qpopper does not appear to be in active development any longer.  Also,
qpopper doesn't properly update inboxes in the event that mail arrives
while mail is being served to the POP client.  Qpopper is less memory
intensive than ipop3d is, but it's not as well supported and doesn't
handle real-world situations very well (read: it's buggy).

We just recently dealt with qpopper because ipop3d was simply consuming
too much memory and was driving our primary server into the ground.
We switched to qpopper, which immediately solved our memory and
performance problems, but all of a sudden user mailboxes started getting
corrupted.  We've since increased the memory in our system and have gone
back to ipop3d.

We've contacted Mark Crispin, author of ipop3d and much of the IMAP suite.
Mr. Crispin suggests moving to a mail system that doesn't store messages
in the standard UNIX "mbox" format.  The mbox format is not designed for
modern day mail systems, and can't be manipulated very well.  As a result,
you encounter programs like qpopper that make invalid assumptions about
how mail will be handled, or programs like ipop3d that require extreme
amounts of resources in order to work around the problems inherent in
the underlying mail system.

Mr. Crispin suggests moving to an alternative mail system where messages
are stored in a different, more easily manipulated format, to improve
performance *and* security, and to reduce (or at least level-out)
resource demands.  Unfortunately, this would result in incompatabilities
between the new mail system and older mail clients, such as "mail",
"Mail", and "elm", that don't support other mailbox formats and can't
retreive mail via POP or IMAP.  The solution in these cases is to offer
wrappers that would retreive mail via POP3 or IMAP using "popclient"
or "fetchmail", store the mail in an mbox-format file, then invoke the
mbox-format-capable client to read the contents of that file.

I noticed that emails from some sources have a file WINMAIL.DAT attached,
or uuencoded, included with the mail message. I can view this file with a
hex editor and it seems to contain a copy of the message, with various
non-ASCII codes between the parts of the message. Those people from whom I
tend to get these WINMAIL.DATs are no experts in email, or computers at
all, and tend to be surprised when I ask them about the attachment. Does
anyone know what is going on on their end? Maybe some Windows mail
software trying to send a formatted version of the text along with the
ASCII text?

Thanks,
     -  Hans

    Probably.  The exact answer depends on your setup.  If you have
a WWW browser, browser my home page and follow the link to all the
goodies Nancy McGough has available.  She has quite a bit of
information on mail filtering.

Let me make a small off-topic comment that Screen is perhaps the single
most useful program I have ever seen.  I regularly connect from many
different types of machines (Xterms, Windows and Mac, and my home machine
is a Linux box) and Screen allows me to run a half-dozen of my favorite
programs (some on remote computers) from all these platforms and switch
instantly between them.  The program is very configurable and can even be
password protected.  The ability to detach from a Screen session and
re-attach to all the (still running but sleeping) processes at any time
works so well that I will often run the same instance of Pine for weeks at
a time, although I may access it from dozens of different computers. 

I'm also quite thrilled that the combination of Linux/Screen/14.4k modem
has enabled my 386 to retain usefulness as an actual computing tool,
rather than just a doorstop.

Two causes:
	1) /tmp does not not permit world write.
	2) there is a stuck lock file on /tmp.

The fix for (1) is to make sure that /tmp is protected 1777.

The fix for (2) is to delete all files on /tmp which have protection 000
and whose name begins with "."

Subject: new rapid viral multiplex RT-PCR-EHA

RAPID Detection of RSV(A OR B),Influenza A or B, and Parainfluenza 
virus types 1,2,and 3 in respiratory infections by 
HEXAPLEX-PCR*-Quantitative


Infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A,B), 
influenza A and B and human parainfluenza virus types 1,2, and 3 
(HPIV-1,2,and 3) produces upper and lower respiratory tract 
infections including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in 
infants, young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised and 
chronicaly ill patients of all ages.  These 7 virus groups make up 
approximately 80-90% of viral respiratory pathogens found to cause 
disease in the above mentioned patients.  Furthermore, recent 
studies have shown that ~5% of hospitalized adults with pneumonia 
have RSV as the etiology.  In immunocompromised patients infection 
with one of the above viruses have been found in 18-31% of adult 
and pediatric patients with mortalities ranging between 40-50%.  
The seasonalities of these seven viruses overlap considerably and 
occur between September thru June with specific peaks in Nov, Jan, 
March, and June.  It has been estimated that 250,000 children are 
hospitalized each year in the U.S. because of viral lower 
respiratory infection.  Because infection with other agents may 
produce similar symptoms, rapid identification of the specific 
virus in clinical specimens may significantly affect patient 
treatment, morbidity, and cost (length of hospitalization).  If 
antiviral treatment is considered, virus quantitation may prove 
useful clinically.

Laboratory diagnosis of these 7 pathogens is usually made by viral 
isolation of intact virus particles in cell culture, an assay which 
gives results in 2-14 days (avg=4 days) and at best has a 
sensitivity of 50-60%.  More rapid antigen detection assays have 
problems with sensitivity and specificity.  The best assays are for 
RSV and may approach 80-90% sensitivity and only test for this one 
virus!!  To fully evaluate a patient for common respiratory viruses 
7 different antigen detection assays would have to be done.  Newly 
available technology, such as RT-PCR-EHA*, can provide increased 
senitivity over cell culture, much faster results, quantitation, 
and all in one assay!!!  In patient specimens such as 
nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, nasal wash or aspirate, 
pleural fluid, or bronchoalveolar lavage, RT-PCR-EHA* detects the 
genetic material of the virus--even when only a few virus particles 
are present--regardless of whether the virus is viable or intact.

Prodesse,Inc. offers HPIV-1,2,and 3, RSV A and B and Influenza A 
and B RT-PCR-EHA* combinded as the respriatory virus HEXAPLEX**

I am using pine version 3.95L-1 with the qmail package with linux 
kernel 2.0.12_6 and am encoutering problems when I try to send mail 
using pine.

Originally when I sent mail, there would be a message saying

> /usr/sbin/sendmail: Permission Denied

This file had the wrong link. I changed the link to the qmail sendmail 
wrapper. I can receive/send mail using the regular "mail" program that 
comes with linux. When I try sending mail with pine I get the following 
near the bottom of the console.

> Segmentation fault		[Sending mail |  0%|]

and exits the program.

does anyone know what is causing the segmentation fault. I would 
appreciate it if someone could suggest a way of fixing this.

Question:
--------
 Why does Pine need file permissions on a Folder in my Folder collection
like the following: i.e. octal 600

-rw-------   1 vikas    vikas    1085108 Nov 26 12:04 Miscellaneous

The reason I am asking this is;
 I am using 'slrn' to read Usenet news (why not Pine? :-)....that is a whole
different story :) ).... and when I save postings I want to save to 
my 'mail' directory, Pine does not list that folder when I go to my
Folder List screen because it has the 'standard' file permissions ..
i.e. -rw-r--r--
 When I forcefully 'chmod' this file to -rw-------, and go out and back to
the Folder List screen, it shows up all right and I am able to use
that Folder just fine 'n dandy...

Why cannot Pine just read any file as long it is in the proper 'mailbox' format
and is 'readable' by the Pine process? 

Help???

Thanks,

It's on my list to implement this.  It's not trivial, because the way the
code is currently constructed it has no idea of the name of the NNTP host
when it goes to access the .newsrc file.

I've tried without success to get a precise specification of how this
works in other news software.  Such questions as:
 1) Is .newsrc still used?  Under what conditions?
 2) How do you know when to create .newsrc.host instead of .newsrc?
 3) What is written as the host part?  Is the host name canonicalized,
    and how?  [Stop once CNAMEs are resolved and have a fully-qualified
    domain name, or do you get the IP address and look up the PTR record
    for that address?]  Is case coerced to lowercase?  etc.
 4) Suppose there is a local news spool as well as NNTP.  What are the
    rules for .newsrc?

I can easily decide these details on my own, but if the intent is to be
interoperable with other news readers I need to know their rules.  I very
much do not want to guess at these rules, only to find out much later
(when the bug reports come in) that the guess was wrong in some subtle
way.

If it isn't important to be interoperable with other news readers, I'd do
something much better than .newsrc; how would you like to have all the
flags (not just the deleted flag) be sticky across sessions, so it
remembers what postings you've answered, what messages you've read, you
can flag messages, etc.). 

Actually, we've already decided that sooner or later there will be a
better mechanism than .newsrc.  The question is if that is "sooner" as
part of supporting multiple servers or "later".

[Sorry in advance - this post started as a reply with a single point
to make, but degenerated into a set of musings on related matters...]

I really like the idea of getting some sort of access to mail
filtering added into Pine -- people strongly expect it to be there
(yes, yes, we _do_ know that this is an MUA not an MDA and all that
good stuff, but...).

However, this may be more difficult than it seems.  For folks running
Pine on a Unix box it's "just" a matter of providing some sort of easy
interface to writing a .procmailrc file (and creating the appropriate
.forward file), or the equivalent for filter, et al.  But... what
about folks running Pine on a PC, remotely accessing an IMAP server?
If they have a Unix shell account, it could be dealt with through
either arranging for the remote Pine to write the .procmailrc/.forward
files there, or requiring a one-time logon, and using the host-based
Pine to do the job.

But I suspect it's becoming more common to set up IMAP servers as
independent mail-spool machines, where users don't have a logon or
home directory, just a mail file.  Are those folks just out of luck?
Or is there some sort of solution that could be devised for them?

And, back to the main point... to generalize it a little, maybe
something could be done to allow a sort of "plug-in" as a mail filter
construction routine.  After all, there are procmail, filter, and
whatever-else out there.  Perhaps something analogous to the way Pine
currently (I think) invokes the system's "passwd" command, or the way
Pine now has hooks for doing external processing of read/written
messages (primarily used for encryption).  If the approach is external
and modular, then system folk could install the module(s) relevant for
their system.

Hmmm... in conjunction with that, might there be a way to use the
filtering hooks, procmail, and some scripting glue to allow me to read
a message and then, say, "reply" to the message (via a special filter)
in such a way that its sender gets put automatically into a
block-mail-from-this-sender list...  Interesting...

If you are going to have your own FreeBSD box, it should be very easy
for you to setup procmail or filter to filter your mail.

There was already a mail to this list dealing with this subject (Fri, 22 Nov).
I didn't save it, but I just found that I printed it (should be in

Thanks for interesting suggestions - got me realize it's time to enhance

full-screen windows, switching between which is lightning fast. Xterm
next...

Speed, easiness to use and sophisticated threading and scoring features
(for those who want them) can really be combined. For some time I have
been reading news with slrn, and find it superb.
    The same goes for the slim but powerful, beautifully designed mail
client mutt, which I have been using for a couple of weeks.
    However, both these programs require of the user some
initialization time and effort, for scanning through the manual, and
trimming the configuration file to one's satisfaction. That fixed, ah..
    Perhaps this is a basic problem with popular programs like pine
and tin: they are trying to satisfy _both_ the absolute computer
beginners, occasional users, lazy never-open-a-manual people(argh!)
with a "friendly" interface and tons of help and config menus, _and_ the
power users with an ever growing battery of features. An impossible
goal, _really_ satisyfying no one, and making the programs too heavy and
resource consuming?

It has been awhile since I saw the original default for the composers wrap.
So I agree with you. 

But I was basing my information on "A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet
Community" which states...

Limit Line Length and Avoid Control Characters.

Try to keep your text in a generic format.  Many (if not most) of the
people reading Usenet do so from 80 column terminals or from workstations
with 80 column terminal windows.  Try to keep your lines of text to less
than 80 characters for optimal readability.  If people quote part of your
article in a followup, short lines will probably show up better, too.

...so I thought 75 was a good average. But like I said, I agree that 70
would better :)  .

: > Place hard returns at the end of a line ...
: 
: Not a very good idea IMHO, and bad advice to a novice user, see below.
: 

What I meant was that if the composer (like in Nutscrape) doesn't
understand line length, then one should place a return before 80 columns
limit has been exceeded.

I have read many peoples messages that was composed on Nutscrape and they
always exceed several hundred columns of text per paragraph. This is always
fun to include in a reply. So by hitting the return before 80 (75) columns
in the composer, would help and insure that lines are not to long. 

Perhaps this NewsGroups wasn't necessarily the best place to complain about
Nutscrape's composer.

I agree, TABS should not be used.

: Why?  Do ya wanna SHOUT?
: 

It is my understanding that a proportional font merely means that the
letter "i" is the same width as the letter "w". So that 75 "i"'s would end
up on the same column as 75 "w"'s

This is useful if someone wants to point out something...
                                   ^^^^^
...so the carrots should be under the word "point".
 
However, after further review, perhaps I should of said fixed-pitch font
instead?

: What's a AMIGA ... That's like one of them supernintendos??
: 

Where to begin? It is a computer that can run the PC OS, Mac OS, Unix OS,
etc and of course its own great OS.

It is a computer that had multitasking 10 years before the Microsloth's
Windows95.

I could go on, but....

Hello,

Just found a interesting thing this morning between the News Xpress (NX) 
and Pine. Here's what happened... 

I was having some problems with the speed of my video card so I thought I
would check out Comp.Sys.IBM.PC.Hardware.Video and see if anyone had left
any messages similar to the problems I was having.

So I connected to my ISP with PPP and started NX. Clicked view all, double-
clicked c.s.i.p.h.v. NewsGroup and the articles started to load in. This
was taking a very long time, so I started NetTerm and went into my Shell. 
Started Pine and added the c.s.i.p.h.v. NewsGroup to my list and had it
fetch the articles too. 

Pine finished before NX, and I started to look around. Finally NX was done
and then I noticed something strange.

Pine had received 2700+ new articles and NX had received 4100+ new
articles.  Obviously this was the reason that NX took so much longer then
Pine, but why not a closer amount of new articles then 1400?

I HAVE NEVER viewed this group before, so it wasn't a matter of one NEWSRC
file for one program that was different then the other for the same group.

So my question is... Why such a big differents in the amount of new
articles between two different programs, receiving the same NewsGroup at
the same time?

Here are some of the theories that my ISP's Tech Support and I came up
with...

NX does not understand deleted files on the news server, so it loaded in
all the articles that it found, even old one and pine does understand the
differents.

- or -

Since Pine is a memory/cpu hog, there is a cap that has been placed on
Pine so that it can only hog... errr um :) ... fetch only so many articles.

...Are we close? Is it something else?

Thanks for reading and any suggestions are welcomed.

    Go into your Pine configuration (from the Main Menu) and set the
character set which *Pine* knows about to ISO-8859-1 .  Pine is
generating the message and does not know about your rc.keymap file. 
ISO-8859-1, I believe, is the standard designation, not ISO-Latin-1,
even though the character set is commonly referred to as Latin-1.

Another related problem is how Pine handles list of known groups on
server. Currently, Pine *always* fetches newsgroups list when I SUbscribe
to new group. In case of slow line it is pretty time-(and
money-)consuming.

What about storing local copy of available newsgroups and update them if
neccessary (e.g. when requested group was not found)? I understand, that
it would be hard to do currently, as you have no idea which server is
accessed, but if you are moving to multiple servers support, it should be
easy.

I hope this is on topic since I don't have the original post, sorry if I'm
wrong. I am NOT intending this to be a flame, but rather an observation.

As I see it, the best way to fix lines that go over 80 columns is not to
tell the person to have their communication software do the word wrapping
for them. This tends to make people lazy. 

But instead to follow the guideline that most people follow and that is
don't let the outgoing message exceed 75 columns in the first place. 

Make sure Pine knows the maximum width is 75 columns by going into the
configuration and setting that value (composer-wrap-column). 

Place hard returns at the end of a line if you must or use the 'JUSTIFY'
(^J) in Pine to fix lines that go beyond 75 columns (most important
including quoted text and how to trim them). 

More and more people who write E-Mail or post to UseNet use crappy programs
such as Nutscrape which has no concept of width (among other things:)  ). 

If people would learn that there is such a thing as Net-etiquette as it
pertains to columns, quoting would be so much easier overall.

And while I'm on the soap box, people need to use proportional fonts too. 

I done :)  . 

C-ya,

Obviously I agree with that!

You've taken the remark entirely out of context.  I was only
commenting on someone's earlier claim that the expression "Latin-1"
meant "ISO-8859-1".

As to what you have said, well, you have to set PINE to agree with the
code that your terminal emulation is set to.  Alternatively you set your
terminal emulation to what PINE is set to.  Hey, I'm reminded of a
remark in a Chinese cookbook that says either this dish has to be eaten
immediately after it's cooked, or if that's not possible, it needs to be
cooked immediately before it's eaten.

best regards

hello,

once more today i wondered about the missing subject of some of my
incoming mail...

i noticed that every mail coming from the X.400 world lacked a subject...

now i looked into the headers and found a Subject Field..., so why isn't it
recognized?

i put into the appendice first a header of a X.400 mail (Subject not
recognized, and after a header of normal SMTP-mail, header recognized)
I do not see major differences with the Subject-Tag, so what shall be made
to make the X.400-coming Subject visible?

here i am again,
i noticed a difference....

there a blank lines in the header coming from the X.400 parts, and probably
its their fault, that the header isn't recognized correctly...

what's about the lines beginning with spaces/tabs? do they too make a
problem?

it would be easy to fix, in fact the header parsing should only stop when
after a blank line the following line do not begin with X400-Received
(supposing, that indented lines do not make problems)

where should this be made? does anybody already fixed that? For sure a
better fix would be to correct the X.400/SMTP Gateways..., but in meantime
it would be nice if pine could have a workaround...

You *don't* have Subject: any more - the X-Status: is followed by blank
line, and anything after it becomes a body :-( It is problem of your local
mail delivery program, which treats X400-* header as start of *body*.

But I am just curious, what system do you use? I have seen the same
problem on our systems as well when usin /bin/mail (rmail is just a link
to /bin/mail) - it choked on every unknown header (not only X... -
MIME-Version: would do as well ;)

But I didn't spend time to investigate it - I am pretty happy with
sendmail/procmail/Pine.

what about lines beginning with trailing blanks?

i am now using qmail/deliver/pine, but i had exactly the same problem as i
was using sendmail/deliver/pine....

i suspect it is more a problem with the X.400/SMTP gateway than one of my
local system....
But i think that i have not enough authority to  let it fix by the
responsible persons :)
thsu i need a local fix...

	Is there really a "blank-line" below where I've added an "*"

	If so, that is your problem as the blank line denotes the end
of the headers and the "Subject:" line appears after that.  The problem
then becomes, what is putting the blank line there????

Just one thing to note - you are still using the same local delivery
program (deliver).

It would mean, that your sedmail gets message without *any* header in it
at all!!! I suspect, it would add at least Mesage-Id: to it.

Unlikely.  INN, the most prevalent news server, doesn't keep "deleted"
articles on the server, it deletes them.  If an article's been cancelled,
the client never sees it.

Doubtfull, but possible, I suppose.

If you read other groups that have articles crossposted to this new group
you read, perhaps Pine is smart enough to recognize articles that you've
already seen in other groups.

procmail, autonomous mail processor, should be invoked automatically over 
the .forward file mechanism as soon as mail arrives.

it is available at ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de as 
pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz.

Why not just do what we do, and run with a "077" umask for all users by
default?  PINE is just doing what it's supposed to do in relation to the
umask, IMHO.

The way I have understood is to use other mail notification programs
to do that, for e.g., xbuffy or xmultibiff on Unix for X-windows.

I don't think pine by itself has that capability ??

I am having some problems while reading mail in PcPine (DOS version), and
that is that the incoming messages get all their highbit characters all
messed up.

I have got it to correctly convert outgoing mails to ISO 8859-1, but I
can't get it to convert ingoing mails from ISO 8859-1. All I get are
question marks.

Does anyone have any ideas? If you have the answer, please also mail me,
so that I won't miss the answer. If you're just doing some general
commentary on the matter, please don't mail me, just post to this group.

I am a college professor, which you should have been able to deduce from the
sig, and a UNIX and Internet consultant, which my not be clear from my sig.
In either of those you do a *lot* of reading because if you do not stay up
with what is going on your market value plummets (not to mention
professional pride).

If you are not capable of paying enough attention to detail to figure out at
least the first job above, then you probably would not be any good at the
second one.  If you think that all I do is read news several hours a day,
then you fundamentally fail to understand the work load of the average
college professor.   :|

I had the same problem but in reverse.  Assuming you're dialing-in from
home and depending on your communications program this might work for you. 
Change the terminal emulation mode to VT100.  Also try some other modes. 
Usually the change will not take place untill the next time you logon.  If
you find something else that works please let me know. 

Hope this helps,

Subject: headers query
Date: 30 Nov 1996 00:26:26 GMT
Message-ID: <57nuvi$kj6@news.spies.com>

i'm having some trouble with my From: line
using Pine.

i'm a subscriber to a local ISP. i have
a ppp account with my own IP and domain name.
we just upgraded Sendmail.. to version
8.8.3, i believe. before that, any message
i sent would have the From: line say
"yol@esophagus.com", using my domain name.
since then, it now says From: yol@area.com,
which is the name of my ISP.

interestingly, if i send mail via /usr/ucb/Mail,
my From: line is correct.

i spent a while going through the docs and
FAQ for Pine at their website. i tested
out a number of custom configurations in
my .pinerc and nothing has fixed this.
i can't seem to figure out what i/Pine
is doing wrong.

here is an example of the headers:

Actually 3 choices, and the best one is not listed.  I read two replies to
the above message.  Neither the current one nor the other one pointed out
that you can set an option in pine to play an initial keystroke list.  Here
are the comment line and the setting line from my
.pinerc:

# Pine executes these keys upon startup (e.g. to view msg 13: i,j,1,3,CR,v)
initial-keystroke-list=i

Amen.

Just a bit of shell-script nit-picking:

You don't need to use some non-standard shell to do something this
sipmle.  You don't need to reset the mask and unset variables in a
shell that's going to go away anyway.  You don't even need the shell to
hang around while pine is running.  I'd suggest the following instead:

	#! /bin/sh
	# pine-secure -- run pine with a secure umask.

	umask 077
	exec pine "$@"
	exit 5	# if exec fails, return an error

 Hmm. You can use the 'vacation' command available on most Un*x
systems... not sure how that would interact with Pine though.
My guess is that it auto-replies to mail independent of Pine.
i.e. as soon as you get mail in your INBOX, 'vacation' rushes off a reply
to the sender while the mail still accumulates in your INBOX.

Yes, there is a wonderful tool called ;AAS (select all apply save.)
Save it to another folder, and rename. Actually, I think you can even
save to the same folder and then expunge the marked ones.

You need to enable-aggregate-commands first.

However, I have heard that this doesn't work over Imap, only on local
folders.  You might save to a local folder and then back, I guess.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

The whole exchange above is confusing.  What do proportional fonts have to
do with shouting?

The above is serious, right?  Proportional means that "i" is approximately
1/4 as wide as "w".  The ones that are the same width for all chars are
called "fixed-width".  Get it?

    I totally agree with you.  However, with respect to Pine, a user
will probably get more and better results by setting the character-set
parameter in the configuration to ISO-8859-1 rather than to something
else for Latin-1, because the former is probably in most common use.

Until recently, I could always print from Pine by using the Y command. 
Lately, this command not only does not work, it freezes up the whole
connection, and I have to log off.  It is still set at "attached to
ANSI", and no other settings were changed?  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Ørjan,
Aggregate operations, including save, certainly do work via IMAP.
If you have any info on what's behind the rumor to the contrary,
please let me know...

I don't think you really want to do that. What is the line you want to
put instead? The charset is changed in Setup/Config character-set, not
in customized-headers. If you want a different Content-type, well,
that would severely mess up Pine's attachment system.

Ahh yes; I forgot:  The IMAP spec does not specify whether or not the
order of message IDs in a COPY command must be preserved, so it is up to
the server implementation.  At the moment, the UW server optimizes the
sequence of messages to be copied for best performance, rather than
preserving the sort order.  I'm not sure what other servers do. 

In the event that one is using an IMAP server that honors message ID
order for COPY commands, there is actually a hidden option in Pine
("save-aggregates-imap-copy") to allow optimizing performance if the user
is not interested in the copy order.

Note that if the destination folder is on a *different* IMAP server, an
APPEND command is used instead of COPY, and the sorted order would be
preserved in that case.

There may be several ways to setup asynchronous connects but probably
it is best to use the method that is suggested by the associated
man pages -- in this case getsockopt(3N):

     SO_ERROR returns any pending error on the socket and clears the
     error status.  It may  be used  to check for asynchronous errors
     on connected datagram sockets or for other asynchronous errors.

This should work on all platforms which support BSD sockets.

Pine's sort command, according to the documentation, sorts how the
folder is rendered in pine's display.  It does not actually sort the
messages in the file.

Are there tools to do this?  I would particularly like to be able
to sort some of my local pine mailboxes.

Well, I don't know what to make of it then. If, as you say, the articles

something screwy going on. 1400 messages is a big difference between two

This turned out not to be the case since I was able to read all 32,000+ new
articles in news.newusers.questions with PINE. NX crashed do to the fact
that there was more the 16K worth of articles (16-bit NX bug; I should of
remembered that before I started).

That I know for sure doesn't work in PINE or NX, I wish, but sadly no they
don't do that.

On a side note:

Do you know if it is normal for the default composer (PICO) to have trouble
justifying a line once the message has been postponed?

It seems it loses track of the character used for quoting
(reply-indent-string = : in my case) and justifies the hole line missing
the point of what the reply-indent-string is for. 

This DOESN'T happen if I do the same thing to the original message before a
postpone, only after the message was postponed.

Do you think that PICO has the problem, do to PINE not relaying the
information correctly? Or is it PINE not giving the information to PICO? Or
is it that PINE is trying to give the information to PICO, but PICO doesn't
understand? 

Only when a message is postponed does this problem occur.

Thanks for the reply.

That isn't helpful.  Either provide authoritative references, or
accept the fact that unofficial usage is unofficial.  As far as I'm
concerned, DOS CP 850 and EBCDIC CECP1047 are valid encodings of
the Latin-1 repertoire.  Naturally, I agree that they aren't ISO
standard codings of the Latin-1 repertoire, but I never claimed
that they were.

Else I'll set my erstwhile usergroup ISO representative on you.  He's
a Quebecois, and even the French know better than to tangle with
a Quebecois ISO delegate... 

cheers
