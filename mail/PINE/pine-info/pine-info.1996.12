Impose disk quota on the storage of email.  If users lose emails due to
disk quota, it is their fault.  Try to warn them early and frequently so
that you are protected... :-)

You can disable the POP3 altegether if you want.  When this happens, all
Eudora users will have to find IMAP clients and you'll get earful of
complaints.  You still have to impose disk quota since IMAP does not solve
disk problems.

Could somebody kindly let me know how to get the overlap between 
screenfuls of a message down from 2 to 0 in Pine 3.91.

It does not have the "overlap default" feature in the options menu as 
does Ver. 3.95.

If this is too basic for the list, just e-mail me at:
maxswn@skypoint.com.
Just decided to jump in here right away, 'cause that overlap is driving 
me nuts!

    Use Bcc: or, in later versions of Pine, Lcc:.  In Pine, information
about these header fields is available online.  If you use Bcc:, you
should put at least one address, such as your own, in the To: field.

	The "real" answer is upgrade to 3.95 since you'll get some
new features and bug fixes.

	To answer your question, however,...

	In the source go to the pine/osdep directory and edit the
appropriate os-xxx.h file.  (xxx=OS in the build command.)  Make
changes to the "#define DF_OVERLAP " line and recompile.

	Regards,

Well, is it an IMAP mailbox or a POP mailbox?

If the latter, I'm going to guess (though I don't actually have any
direct knowledge) that the protocol doesn't give you much of a choice.

The decision of whether or not mail is left on the server is completely up
to the POP3 client.  The POP3 client must issue an explicit delete command
(DELE in POP3 protocol) to remove messages.  There is no way that the
server can force the client to download messages.

You could something like automatically delete the mailbox when a POP3
session completes.  It's up to you whether or not destroying users' mail
is a good idea.

Dominik,
Logan is right that we don't have enough info to help you.
If your inbox-path and folder collection both have the same IMAP server
specification, then Pine will issue an IMAP COPY command, in which case
the copy operation is local to the server.  Otherwise, the message(s) will
be pushed from Pine to the destination IMAP server via an IMAP APPEND
command.

Hi all,

I have the following problem using pine 3.95.
I setup pine to save messeges in various folders depending on the name of
the sender. This work well, but when I compose a message for one of that
senders it saves me the message to his/her folder instead of the sent-mail
folder.
I want all messages I write to be saved in sent-mail folder.

Does anybody know why this happen?
For instance I setup 
(*) default-fcc
from fcc-name-rule section in config.

Thanks to all.

Hi!  Tonight I accessed my e-mail and was told I had new mail.  When I
accessed PINE I pushed "return" without waiting, in order to get to the
mail faster.  Unfortunately, the computer had been asking me if I wanted
to move my sent mail to a folder called "sent-mail-1996" (I think).  I
thought I should look at the folder and probably delete everything in it,
because I don't need any of it, but I cannot find it when I list the
folders.  How can I access it?

Glad you're there!
Regards,
Carol.

Have I ever said about keeping them in memory? I just thought about
something like:
  if newsgroups-list-file not initialized
      init it from server
  if group not in newsgroups-list-file
       refresh it from server
       look in the file again
  sigh ...

Searching disk file will be faster as accessing server; if you have really
fast connection, disable caching of newsgroups.

Well, it is the way most browsers work (I admit not being familiar with
pure newsreaders). Just add the command "Update news groups list"; also it
is possible to set some threshhold value to update list automatically
(let's say, once a month). And again, those, who don't like it, can always
disable cacheing.

	I am just writing to ask why I can no longer post to newsgroups.
Up until last week, I had no problems, but since then an error comes up
each time I try and doesn't allow me to post.  Please get back to me as
soon as possible with some sort of explanation, for there are certain
newsgroups I must stay in contact with.  Just in case, I have tried many
different newsgroups, and none of them work for me.  Thank you.

Message-ID: <1996Nov30.172351.35308@ucl.ac.uk>
Date: Sat, 30 Nov 1996 17:23:51 GMT

I'm at home, using PC Pine (OS/2) to read stuff in my remote mailbox
on the University machine.

When I tag a whole bunch of messages and save them to a remote mail folder,
it takes forever.  What seems to be happening is that Pine is sending each 
message to my PC, and then back again to the remote folder.

Pine is usually so good at handling the remote/local distinction elegantly. 
This seems an anomalous failing.

Message-ID: <57nl8v$1fc$1@melbourne.DIALix.oz.au>

I have been working on this for days but have been beaten so far..

When sending mail (ie: from pine or Elm) I can do it from root but not as 
a user.  The error message in Pine is:

451 failed to queue message: spool file call_mailer ERROR: Mail not sent.

In my smail paniclog it says: cannot create spool file, dir=/var/spool/smail

I have checked permissions, links, .. whatever I can think of over and 
over and can't work out why it only works while logged in as root.
If anyone has an answer, idea or even a guess where to look, I'ld be very 
appreciative.

Many thanks,

Darren Merritt

If pine refers to the /usr/spool/mail/$user file as the inbox and then
some user creates a folder in their mail directory called inbox, how
can I as a system administrator make sure that this either doesn't happen
or that the users will see these as seperate files?

I would like to be able to have all my email forwarded to another ISP for a

way to do this on a typical UNIX server?

Thanks,

    Unfortunately, as a rule of thumb it often causes problems to use a
word processor to compose email or news.  A text editor is much safer. 
Like it or not, the Internet is still largely based on ASCII with a
hard end-of-line indication, and most word processors use other
internal mechanisms.  Some WP's allow exporting of a document in ASCII,
but even then there can be gotchas.  I suggest a text editor over a
word processor.

    As for apostrophes and quotation marks, make sure you are entering
the ASCII characters, not some nice looking symbol which is not ASCII.

    Such documents may already be in correct ASCII format.

    Are you using your laptop to dial into a host computer?  If so,
then it could be that the signals generated by your arrow keys (so to
speak) are not getting translated correctly into the control sequences
expected on the host system for cursor movement.  For example, when I
dial into my provider, DOS communications software on my DOS PC
emulates a VT100 terminal.  When I press an arrow key, the comm s/w
translates that into the equivalent control sequence standardized for a
VT100, and the cursor moves.  If you are dialing in somewhere, you
might check your terminal emulation.  This is only one possibility, of
course.

Every time I cut and paste my word processed documents the line wrapping

Yet when I cut and paste most internet documents into Pine there are

Can anyone help me?  And why is it that my ARROWS in my word

Does anyone know of a way that I can get msmail to automatically extract 
a few pertinent lines of text that is always at the end of my message?  
Or conversely,just delete say like the first 40 lines of text
automatically?  The reason I need to do this is that at the end of every
day, I get my stock quotes and news in one email. At the end of this
email is the data that i need to see,the quotes. I have my email sent to
my alphanumeric pager using a paging program,but the problem is,each
beep/page can handle only 240 characters,therefore with all the blanks
and dashes in the beginning of my email from this particular service
takes up all my allotted space!  Any help or suggestions at all are
GREATLY AND GRACIOUSLY appreciated,my wisdom is finite,very finite.

I was fooling around with my email one day, and somehow, I changed it so
that I cannot see the heading of the letters when ppl write to me.  In
other words, I can not see who it came from or their address at the top
like it used to.  I am talking about the stuff above the words "message
text".  Please help me change it back!

Hi...

I use Pine Mail in the Unix Shell when I login
to my ISP with Windows 95 and Procomm Plus for
windows (communications software)

In my pine mail setup I use the "attached to
ANSI" for my printer..and there is a printer
set up in Windows 95.

When I was running strictly Windows I had
no problem printing...now when I threw windows
95 on my pc...I suddenly can't print to my
attached printer.

Help?  Anyone?  My mailbox is starting to fill 
up.

Kathleen

Situation:
 I am replying to a mail and I want to attach some other mails from
some of the folders in my folder collection. Can I do this?
 i.e. I hit 'R' to reply to a certain mail and I decide that I want
to attach/forward or whatever certain other mails?

 Right now, I am going about it by a very cumbersom way i.e. Export
the attachments I need to Unix files (using Pine's
wonderful ';' feature) and then simply 'read' them in in
my editor when I am composing my reply or attach that file in the
message header.
 
 Any better solution?

Thanks,
--Vikas

 [Part 2, Application/OCTET-STREAM (Name: "FIBU.DE")  4.4KB]
  [Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part]


  [Part 3, Application/OCTET-STREAM (Name: "PIZZAP1.GIF")  4.1KB]
  [Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part]

gif.

As i tryed to view them i got a 
[VIEWER Result: sh: hd: command not found]

which is in conformance with my .mailcap (i corrected hd to od BTW)

There is another "dirty" solution, though. You can save it as "DOS with codes"
in Word (if you use it, which you shouldn't, of course). This way, you can
keep your Umlaute, however, you'll lose the "apostrophes" which probably
aren't apostrophes, anyway, but rather special characters.

Cheers,
Robin

I know one important way in which a spurious blank line is introduced
into a mail message. It is to use 

cat message | sendmail -t

to send a preformatted mail (e.g. when you might have used formail to
put a new header on to a reply message) to whomever the mail is
preaddressed to.

On my system: Linux RedHat, sendmail-8.7.4, a blank line is inserted
somehow after X-Status:
This is particularly bad for multi-part messages because the MIME
description is then not recognized.

This appears to be a sendmail bug, unless there is some reason why a
blank line ought to be acceptable but is not acceptable to pine.

Hello

Have recently joined the list and much appreciate the advice and shared
knowledge.

AsI have become more familiar with Pine, the inevitable questions arise.

I post one question/observation per email for convenience

When deleting (eg in reply mode) using Ctrl K, frequently the number of
deleted lines is greater than I want. I have to undelete and start again.

Is there a stop-command command that can be used?

I have this problem only on Mac, not on a PC. (but I more frequently use
the Mac (-:

I've tried but seem unable to use the ctrl K command 

Using v3.93

thank you

is it possible to set up folders within folders?

I have a number of groupings of saved documents (different subjects) each
with abut 3o folders in them.

It would be more efficient I think, when saving mails, S, if I can Ctrl T
first to the "subject" folder, and then to the individual folder to get
the right folder for saving in.

The individual folders change quite frequently.  I can't remember all the
folder names

Using v 3.93

This is prob off-topic

I would like to fax document to my email account and then EDIT the text. 
I've got about 40 a4 pages of text.  Would save me a lot of input typing 

Don't have access to a OCR scanner

When scrolling down the list of folders (i have about 120) the scrolling
frequently passes the folder I need.

Is there a stop-command command that can be used?

There is no "Stop deleting" command.  This is mainly because each ^K
deletes one line.  Ergo you should only type the number of ^K's you
actually need to delete the text.

It sounds like either your Mac, network link or host is introducing a
delay, and you are getting lost with the number of ^K's you have typed.

Or perhaps you are holding down the ^K and using auto-repeat to
delete lots of lines?  If so it is very difficult to judge when to release
the key because of all the buffering of keystrokes that can be happening
on your Mac, in your network link, or on your mainframe.

If you have a number of lines of text to delete try NOT using ^K to do so,
but to mark the block and THEN use ^K.  This will delete all the lines
within the marked section:

<Arrow keys>		... move to first line of block to be deleted
^^			... set the mark
<Arrow keys>		... move to last line to be deleted
^K			... delete the block

Notes:

* Some Mac terminal emulators require ^^ (Control/^ -- that's circumflex,
  NOT Up Arrow!) to by typed as Control+Shift+6. 

* If you can't get ^^ typed in try Escape-Escape-^

* A second ^^ (or Escape-Escape-6) will cancel the remove the mark.

* If you change your mind after deleting the block type ^U to UnCut it and
  get it back.

*  You can uncut text after moving the cursor elsewhere.  This is a useful
   way of moving a paragraph from one part of the message to another.

Cheers,

To whoever is reading these things,
	I got a question.  Back in Gretna where I used to have e-mail, we
had a telephone type thing where you could call someone up and write to
them in a phone coversation sort of way.  We don't have that here at Skutt
and I would like to know how to set it up.
Any help is appreciated.

No, there is no "Stop" command.

As with your previous message you must be either typing in the Down Arrow
key too often, or else holding it down and letting it auto-repeat.

Instead try using the additional navigation commands that move by a
screenful at a time instead of just one item at a time.

When composing a message these are ^V and ^Y for next and previous
screenful respectively.

In the screens for the index of your messages, folders, and in most other
places (eg, Address Book and online help) these are SPACE and - for next
and previous screenfuls respectively.

These are almost invariably shown in the Command Menu at the bottom of the
display if you're not sure which applies for any given screen.

Cheers,

Using present Pine/IMAP technology it is not possible to set up truly
hierarchical folders (folders within folders within folders ...).

However you will probably find that Pine's concept of "collections" of
folders adequate for your needs.

A collection is a group of related folders.  For example I have a
collection about "Software", one for "People", and one for "Information"
in addition to my default "Mail" collection.

These show up as "main-level" items in the Folder List screen which can be
quickly Arrow-ed between.  Once on the collection of interest you press
Return to "expand" it and see the names of the folders within it.

When saving messages to a folder, or switching between them, you can use
^N and ^P to move between collections, before tpying in the folder name
(or using ^T to list the folders in the collection).

You set up collections of folders in Pine's Setup Configuration screen.

Please see the built-in help there and elsewhere (eg, probably on the
Folder List screen) for further details.

Cheers,

Subject: Locking out bulk e-mail...
Date: 27 Nov 1996 13:59:13 GMT
Message-ID: <57hhfh$ii@raven.eva.net>

I have been receiving lots of bulk e-mail lately.  Is there a way for
a user to some how block out receiving bulk e-mail or is that something
my ISP has to do for me?  I will probably be having my ISP changing my
service so I will be a Unix site dialing into his system via FreeBSD
rather than having a shell account on their system.

Whichever way it needs to be done, I am interested to know the strategy
necessary to get rid of this nuisance.

Particualry there is a problem with -cbreak option of stty comand.
Such option doesn't exist in SCO's stty and i don't know how to
adjust the script. This is the problematic part of pgpdecode Perl script:

----------
if (! (@ARGV[0] =~ /dontask/i) ) {  # option -dontask given?
    # no -dontask:
    print STDERR "Message uses PGP, do you wish to run PGP on it? [Y/n] ";
    system("/bin/stty cbreak < /dev/tty");  # read char without pressing
RETURN
    open (IN, "</dev/tty");
    $runpgp=getc(IN);                     # read exactly one keystroke
from tty
    close IN;
    system("/bin/stty -cbreak < /dev/tty"); # reset tty to normal

Subject: Pine 3.95 and pine.conf/pine.conf.fixed
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello all,

Just a quick question for today.  I recently installed q-mail on my
system to replace sendmail.  One of the things required by this install
is moving the mail folders to the users directories.  System is FreeBSD
2.1.5-Release, Pine is version 3.95.

I would like to set up Pine to default to a file (Mailbox) in the user's
home directory.  I know I need to set inbox-path=Mailbox but for some
reason Pine seems to ignore it's system wide configuration file.  If you
specify the system wide file, it works fine.

I've got pine.conf in /usr/local/lib/ as specified as the default
location for the global config file in the man pages....  Where'd I go
wrong?

Thanks for any pointers!!

-Dave

Hi,

I have recently joined the list and would like to ask ...

How the approval header can be added to a mail message (for a moderated
newsgroup using PINE). I appreciate any help anyone can provide.

I agree completely!  And the directory should be specifiable by the

  1. use BCC: for the list with your E-Mail address in the TO: field
     
  2. Upgrade to version 3.0 and you can also use the nickname in the TO:
     field as long as you have entered a name on the INFO tab of
     the address book.
     (ie. Nickname: 'Newsletter',
          Name field on INFO tab: 'News Subscribers'
     then the list members will see 'News Subscribers' in the TO: field
     on their incoming E-Mail message.

  Over and Out

How about an alternative way?  Check this URL:

Cheers!

BTW, the scheme in this example does not use -cbreak option ... :-)

The rumor I heard (actually, it was a posting here in this group, you
might try DejaNews) is that while aggregate save works over IMAP, it
uses an IMAP command for this, which naturally does not know about pine's
internal ordering.  So you cannot use it to physically reorder a folder,
as the original poster of this thread requested.

Greetings,

Ørjan,
I have some new info on this: 

In fact, sorting/saving works fine via IMAP provided that a) you are using
a recent version of Pine and b) you haven't turned on the hidden feature
"save-aggregates-imap-copy"  --which optimizes performance but doesn't
guarantee the order of the saved messages.

Dave,
I don't have answers to your specific questions, but I believe you can at
least access the miscreant inbox by doing a GOTO ~/mail/inbox  (or
whatever path is appropriate).

Subject: privacy hole in pine
Date: 28 Nov 1996 07:56:41 GMT
Message-ID: <57jgjp$fd4@winx03.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de>

The versions 3.94 (tested on IBM AIX 3.2) and 3.95 (tested on Linux 2.0)
(I don't know about earlier versions.) of pine include a privacy hole:

If you write a new message, pine creates a backup file (named
`#pico<pine-PID>#') of the mail text in your home directory.  The access
mode of this file is determined by your standard umask.  For most users
this is set to `022', thus setting the access mode for the backup file to
644, so that the text you just write is world-readable.  Also the files
`~/.pinerc' and `.addressbook' are created using the default umask.  IMHO
these files should be readable by no one except its owner.  Ok, you can
choose a more private location for `.addressbook' in `~/.pinerc', but that
is not possible for `~/.pinerc'.  As a workaround, I created the following
simple shell script and aliased pine to pine-secure:

--------------------------------
#!/usr/local/bin/tcsh
# /usr/local/bin/pine-secure
set default_umask=`umask`
umask 077
/usr/local/bin/pine $*
umask $default_umask
unset default_umask

That's also my interpretation.  The term Latin-1 designates a repertoire
of characters, without particular reference to their assignment to a
character code.  One could refer to DOS CP850, and EBCDIC CECP1047, as
Latin-1 codes, but they certainly aren't ISO-8859-1 !!  ISO-8859-1 is
the specific ISO code that is defined for the Latin-1 character
repertoire.

Don't bother with that line.  Leave it out.  All that will
happen is that you have to press [Enter] after entering the
y or n.

How should one else type that character? I just got it to work with PCPine
with Ctrl-Shift-6 (I was just about to ask how I cuold get that character
anyway), since I have a Swedish keyboard, and those only have circumflex
as a deadkey (shift-diaeresis). (Shift-6 is '&').

Hmm, seems Ctrl-6 worked to...

One thing that might be nice is to have a location for all of pines 
files, such as the .pinerc, .pine-debug, pico-saves, .addressbooks,etc.  
Just like elm has the ".elm" directory, I'd like to have a ~/.pine and 
then put all these bloody files in there.

Message-ID: <580umj$5l0@ratatosk.uio.no>

Hello!

I've checked through the online help as well as
http://www.washington.edu/pine/ and underlying pages without finding
anything about macros. 

I've been using the aggregate command set and miss the abillity to use
macros e.g to select all messages in a folder and apply the
delete-commando to them and then purge the deleted items

  ;aadxy

Or e.g to select all messages with a special subject and delete them:

  ;ts"subject-text-to-select"d

If it is already possible and I justed missed any documentation on the
subject please notify me and update your Q&A page with the answer!

TIA

  I feel exactly the same way. Perhaps, enhanced support for
IMAP4 is much more desirable than spending a lot of time to
enhance news reader part of Pine(threading,kill file,etc).

Thanks, it works *but* .... :(

When I am sending the mail with pine 3.94 and choose the option to pass
the outgoing mail thru filter pgpencrypt, all works fine, the mail is
corectly encrypted and sent but after that i am not able to go back to
pine menu. 

The screen freeze with note that 100% mail has been sent and
after that pine stops to response on *any* keystroke :(

The only way is to *kill* the pine proces. The same happened when I try
to reade pgp-encoded mesage. :(

  Instead of scrolling the list and looking for the folder name by eyes,
use ^W to search for the folder.

Whenever I receive forwarded mail from mailtool (another unix based gui
type mailer), it comes into my INBOX as two separate messages.  If I
receive a forwarded piece of from another pine user, then it comes into my
INBOX normally (as one message). 

Any ideas?

  Pine doesn't do this.
  See if Procmail or Elm Filter are installed on your system ... they do
what you described.

Guys,
 Is it possible to turn off the 
'Reply to all recipients?' question when I hit 'R' to reply to a 
email? 
 i.e. can it be set to either always-yes or always-no so that this
question can be skipped? It is not too annoying but a feature
for this would certainly be appreciated.

 I am using Pine 4.0 on Solaris 2.5

Thanks,

Yes, but if the directory should be specifiable by the user, where would
such a specification go?  In .pinerc perhaps? :-) 

(I know, I know, you could solve this with an environment variable. But
 that's not something you want to spring on unexperienced users...).

Date: Tue, 03 Dec 1996 12:55:14 GMT
Message-ID: <32a421b5.28130888@news.usf.edu>

Hello,

Sorry if this is a FAQ, I searched the Pine home page but didn't not
find anything on the topic.

When I use ^J ^T to attach a file in PC-Pine (3.95) under Win95, and
if part of the path contains a space (eg: c:\My Documents\test.doc)
PC-Pine cannot locate the file.  I tried playing around with quotation
marks but with no success. 
The only way too get it to work is to either edit the path or enter it
manually to use the standard DOS 8.3 convention for file names (eg:
c:\mydocu~1\test.doc), which renders the ^T feature pretty useless.

Any config setting I overlooked or any way around it?  

Thansk for your help

There was a signal problem in the SCO Unix version of Pine 3.94 that
caused Pine to lock up when remote commands (like filters) where being
issued. This problem was fixed in the next release by switching to System
V signal handling. 

Your choices therefore are to either switch to Pine 3.95, or to uncomment
the line that defines SYSV_SIGNALS in pine/osdep/os-sco.h and rebuild.

Hope this helps!

Kind regards,

Greeting!

We use Pine 3.85 on the Unix system here at the
Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, and
I think that most of us enjoy it a lot.

There is a programming FEATURE in Pine, not
a bug, that I would like to understand.

Pine will print by default to my computer printer when
I am connected to our SAIT system through dial-in access. I'm at
home using the system over the telephone line and
a VT-220 terminal emulation.

I would like to be able to issue a Unix system command
that would do this.  I have tried numerous approaches.
I've read all your documentation (whew), and the setup
files. I've queried all of the Unix people in the school,
including the most expert Unix instructor. None of them
know how it is done. 

Unix in a Nutshell doesn't give away the secret either.

Please tell me how you did this. If I need to write a 
C program to do this would you send me the critical 
code.

I will thank you in advance. One of my objectives for
this semester has been to track this down and you seem
to be the best possible hope.

Thanks again.

Steve Belmore

Thank you very much for your submission!

I was suspicious about pine and i have compiled pine3.95!

All works fine! I was only suprised with the largenes of the binary pine!
It is almous 4 MB large. The previous version was only 1.8 MB large.

Anyway oncemore muchos gracias !

Vikas,
No, not currently.

If there was to be such an option, would you rather have it "always-yes"
or "always-no" ?   (And what's the probability that most folks would
agree? :)

Thanks for responding
No.. No. I did not mean to imply that it should be SET to always-yes
or always-no. Of course not. Put 3 Pine users in a room and I am sure
all 3 would have different opinions :) 

It could be a user-specified Pine feature similar to
all the other features out there. So if I dont want to be bothered
by the question, I would simply set that feature.

 In fact, it could be user-configurable via Setup/Config (.pinerc)
to be one of 3 values:
 o Always-yes
 o Always-no
 o Always-ask-user (the present situation)

(sigh...) anyway, here's to hoping that you wonderful guys out there
at CAC implement this feature soon.

Hi,

When I try to read my mail off line with Netscape or Internet Mail
I have a dialog box saying : "DNS not found ...."

Is it possible to configurate Netscape (or Internet Mail) not to look
for the connexion ?

If you know, thanks for answering.

For me, the following sort-of does what you want (I think):

	pine (recipient's address) < text-file

This puts me in COMPOSE mode with the message body and TO: fields already
in place.  I fill in the SUBJECT line, hit CTRL-X to send and I'm back at
the system prompt, never having seen any Pine menus.

 Well. thats because Pine __supports__ only ONE newsrc file. A lo t of
other newsreaders out there support a per-NNTP-server newsrc file so
that you can have  adifferent newsrc file for each NNTP server
that you use..
 Oh well.. here is to hoping that NNTP is standardised soon and
the good folks over at CAC,Washington  implement all the wonderful
Newsreading 'features' already found in many newsreaders out
there..

You have to set up a mailing list with a name, say "list1"

When using the T function, choose the address you want added to list1. Pine 
will ask you for an abbreviation of the name you have chosen. Type 
"list1" as the abbreviation and then choose the "add" option to add the 
address to the list. You can do this indefinitely.

It's only 1.7Mb. running here under HP-UX (we also have a fairly fat local
mod too). Make sure you strip the executable - that'll shave a *lot* of
size off of it if you're worried about that. Also, executable size varies
depending on the architecture of the machine you are running Pine on.

Make sure that you changed the Makefiles to, for example:

	Change "-g" C compilation to "-O"
		This optimises your code instead of leaving it
		unoptimised and with lots of additional information
		for the debugger.

	Consider _not_ having the "-DDEBUG" option to the C compiler
		This omits certain debugging code within Pine
		(including the stuff which generates the
		$HOME/.pine-debugN files).

	Check your C compiler will use shared C libraries by default
		Using shared libraries can also reduce the size of
		the final executable file.

Having compiled Pine make sure you:

	strip pine

to remove unnecessary symbol table information from the executable.

Cheers,

Please explain why an extraneous connect() is in any way "better"
programming than an extraneous read().  "Not the way I do it" does not
equate to "bad programming".

The extraneous read() allows determination of "success" vs. "failure" by
whether or not the read() fails.  A successful (= no-op) read() means
success.

The extraneous connect() requires the programmer to analyze the returned
error code to determine "success" vs. "failure" condition.  That, in turn,
can lead to portability problems.

Is SUN willing to guarantee that all ports of UNIX and all UNIX-like
systems for all time will only return a certain connect() error code (or
codes) in the success case, and will never return any of those code in the
failure case?  Somehow, I doubt it.

In any case, a different technique is used in Pine 4.00.

(1) The sender should use a MUA with MIME-encoding/decoding such as Pine
or Netscape. Pine maps MIME type and subtype information to the file name
extension of attachments by reading the files ~/.mime.types,
/etc/mime.types, and /usr/local/lib/mime.types (in this order).
A line in ~/.mime.types views e.g. as:
image/gif                      gif
or:
application/postscript         ai eps ps

(2) Save the attachment to a file and check the content by any viewer.

Hope this helps

I apologize if this question is mentioned in an eventual pine FAQ and I'd like
to know where I can find it, if there is one.

I need to mime-attach a high number of text files and the pine browser won't
accept wildcards. How can I do that without going n-times through the browser
and without typing those huge unix paths?

I know I could .tgz everything - that is exactly how I resolved :) but I'd like
to know if there is another solution.

Thanks.

I'm not sure about the Macintosh, but the following worked for me on an RS/6000 
AIX 4.1.4:

   In the ./pine/makefile.a32 file, added the "-DTERMCAP_WINS" entry:
     STDCFLAGS= -Dconst= -DA32 -DSYSTYPE=\"A32\" -DMOUSE -DTERMCAP_WINS

   And in the ../pico/makefile.a32 file, added the "-DTERMCAP_WINS" entry:
     STDCFLAGS= -D_ALL_SOURCE -Da32 -DJOB_CONTROL -DPOSIX -DMOUSE -DTERMCAP_WINS

After doing a "./build clean" and a "./build a32" to recompile, the function 
keys now work great on our Wyse-50 terminals.

While I don't know how you get this same thing done on a Macintosh, I hope this 
points you in the right direction.

Why wont moving the cursor with arrows NOT work with my MAC
(the arrows work in word-processing).

While the arrows (moving the cursor) do work in PINE with my PC?
Any advice?  I'd like to get my Mac to work with the
arrows in PINE.

  You both have recently posted warnings to UseNet news groups about a
supposed trojan horse named "Penpal Greetings" 

  I can find _NO_ information about this trojan after searching the
Web sites of the majority of the reputable ant-virus/virus-alert
companies.  I am extremely suspicious that this is a variation of the
"Good Times" virus hoax warning that has infiltrated UseNet over the
past three years.

  I would encourage you read the "Good Times Virus Hoax FAQ" located
on the Web at: http://users.aol.com/macfaq/goodtimes.html  to arrive
at your own conclusion.  In essence, it is impossible to get infected
by reading your e-mail.

  BTW, you will notice that the only information that could
authenticate the sender of this warning is a mysterious "SAF-IA"
agency, whose supposed phone number is amazingly missing the area
code.  I request that you each forward my message to the individuals
from whom you received this message as a way to stop this hoax.

  In closing, I understand and appreciate your effort to warn other
users of a potential threat.  However, I would encourage you to
forward any future messages of this type to your local IS department
administrator.  They can then take the appropriate measures to confirm
or debunk the reality of the threat.

  I am cross-posting this message to the news groups in which you
posted your copies of the warnings, and request that any
personal replies be sent via e-mail.

hello Mike

A few days ago you were kind enough to advise on folder colections, to
"group" folders with a common subject together.

I was able to set up a collection, by adding, in Setup, Configuration the
name of the collection, namely: MTB, ie:


folder-collections       = mail/[]
                           MTB/[]

I restarted Pine.

Now, when I tried to Add a new folder in this collection, in the same way
as I did when there was onlt yhe default collection, I get the following
response:


(This is the screen):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Incoming Message Folders
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INBOX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder-collection <mail/[]>  ** Default for Saves **
(Local)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder-collection <MTB/[]>
(Local)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]


And this is the message:


          [Can't create mailbox MTB/Admin: No such file or directory]




I was also unable to find the way to transfer folders in the first
collection to the MTB collection.


I'd certainly appreciate any advice


Thank you

Hello pine-folks,

I've just finished searching the pine-info archives and have seen my
problem described in the following message:

Subject: Pine 3.92 and user root : update .pinerc ? bug ? 
From: caron@jade.jouy.inra.fr (Christophe Caron) 
Date: 22 Mar 1996 13:24:04 GMT 

Hi,

On  HP/UX and Solaris 2.4 with pine 3.92

when user root uses pine , i have 
[Error saving configuration in file "/.pinerc": No such file or directory]

when pine try to update /.pinerc.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Apparently, the above problem was fixed for version 3.93, however I'm
experiencing it with 3.95.  I just downloaded the rpm'd source for
Pine3.95 (pine-3.95-2.src.rpm) from the RedHat ftp server (I'm running
Linux 2.0.18 on an i586, gcc 2.7.2) so that I could recompile with the
"ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM" option.  It compiled successfully, and I merely
swapped the resulting pine executable with the previous one I'd been using
(also 3.95 from the binary distribution rpm), and suddenly I got the above
error...  Please point me to the error in my ways (or, better yet, a fix)!
Cheers,

Dave

I should mention that I'm running pine as root (thus the use of
"/root/.pinerc" - but problem also occurs when I run it as user dlane,
but with file "/home/dlane/.pinerc").  I apologise for forgetting this
detail previously

Hello pine-folks,

I've just finished searching the pine-info archives and have seen my
problem described in the following message:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Subject: Pine 3.92 and user root : update .pinerc ? bug ? 
From: caron@jade.jouy.inra.fr (Christophe Caron) 
Date: 22 Mar 1996 13:24:04 GMT 

Hi,

On  HP/UX and Solaris 2.4 with pine 3.92

when user root uses pine , i have 
[Error saving configuration in file "/.pinerc": No such file or
directory]

when pine try to update /.pinerc.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Apparently, the above problem was fixed for version 3.93, however I'm
experiencing it with 3.95.  I just downloaded the rpm'd source for
Pine3.95 (pine-3.95-2.src.rpm) from the RedHat ftp server (I'm running
Linux 2.0.18 on an i586, gcc 2.7.2) so that I could recompile with the
"ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM" option.  It compiled successfully, and I merely
swapped the resulting pine executable with the previous one I'd been
using
(also 3.95 from the binary distribution rpm), and suddenly I got the
above
error... I should mention that I'm running pine as root (thus the use of
"/root/.pinerc" - !!NOTE: the problem also occurs when I run pine as
user dlane,
but it complains about the file "/home/dlane/.pinerc").  Please point me
to the error in my ways (or, better yet, a fix)!
Cheers,

Dave

QuickLink does not do printing in response to VT print codes (which is
what Pine uses to print).

You should go back to using whatever software you were using before.

I really don't know if this is the right place where to ask information
about it, but I'll try.
The problem is the following: when I login a sentence appears: "you have
old mail waiting"...what does it mean? And when I enter Pine there's
written something about a process Number 24151 which keeps a folder
closed. What shall I do to read my old mail which is still waiting?

Thank you in advance
Daniela

Hello!

I've been trying to compile Pine/Pico on VAX/OpenVMS and I have a little
problem. I don't know who can help me, so I write you.

I build Pico without problems, but not Pine. In the distribution files I don't
find the file VMSBUILD.COM for Pine. 

Could you help me, please?

Regards

Please don't say "bulk" unless you're talking about the message
priority that was labeled to the internet message.  Some people send 
Unsolicited Comerical Email, this is known as UCEs.  Usually it's sent
by use of a list of e-mail addresses.  I suspect you are talking about
UCEs that are mailed from a broadcasted mailing list.

Some mail readers have filtering ability.  A few domains are common
problems, but few domains are nothing but businesses involved in these
"junk mailings."  Forinstance, geocities.com is a frequent reference
in junk mail.  Eariler today I communicated with someone at the
Pentagon that has a e-mail address at Geocities.  So filtering mail by
the source domain is not really great.  With a Unix-type email system
you can "easily" dump any message that is sent to more than 15 people.

But that will need a filter -ahead- of it that saves messages from any
mail list you read.  That will get rid of 3/4 or more of the junk
mail.  Best bet is to always respond with a complaint, and a request
that they NOT use your address in the future.  Their mail will slowly
clog up their lifes too!  Don't just hit reply, locate their contact
address.  If it's a local-to-you phone number, please call and tell
them every week for a month that you DO NOT want to ever hear from
them again.  If they're local you could sue them (not for much).  If
anyone wants to start a class action suit against any of these Bozos
I'd be happy to join if they had fouled my screen just once.
Otherwise, get their provider to warn them, and don't make it
profitable to send junk mail to your email address that you must pay
to access.

You underestimate humans.  I've received email from single-senders at
a time.  I've had my nethandle discovered and replyed to...that's a
single lookup.  It will get worse until the law starts criminal
charges on these jaspers.

Minor pain, as another mailreader can be added..

ALSO a pain to your IP provider, as his domain keeps getting hit with
undeliverable email.  The GOOD answer to these these things TODAY
would be for all mail machines to hold -any- message that had two
"bad addresses" messages returned.  Might stop quite a bit of the junk
for a little while.  Established mailing lists could be configured to
not have this limit.

Subject: garbled screen after pico exits
Message-ID: <Pine.NEB.3.95.961206161727.21506A-100000@anduin.woodsoup.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0

Greets,

  I've recently built pine 3.95 for NetBSD.  Pine itself works fine.  Pico
itself works fine (afaik).  The problem occurs when exiting pico *in* pine
after a finished compose session.  For some reason, it appears as though
the "redraw" that would normally occur fails, and the new text is simply
scrolled onto the screen lines at a time, with what appear to be escaped
control codes.  I'm hoping this is a known problem, and someone can offer
some guidance.  I've been unable to locate mention of this in any of the
documentation or FAQs.  

  I have tried to isolate the problem to pico by enabling another editor
for message composition, but alas pico is still invoked to for the
headers, so the problem still occurs.  To be more precise.. it occurs
after the user confirms a ^C cancel, or confirms a ^X send.  The problem
persists from a variety of terminal types (vt100/vt102/xterm/screen).
Pico has been built w/ TERMCAP as the os_unix.h file indicates for a bsd
system.  Any help is appreciated.

-Vasily Lewis

Or, at least in PINE 3.95, you can put the nickname of the distribution
list in the Lcc: field.  You'll see the names listed, but they won't be in
the To: field.  I currently do this method with a distribution list with
success.

I am looking for information on configuring/using PINE with two
different email accounts.

Can this only be done by having one account's INBOX a read-only incoming
folder?

Ideally, I would like to be able to send to and receive email from both
accounts during the same on-line PINE session.

I have read, read, and re-read every document I could find on the net
regarding this inquiry but have not been able to find any information
that directly addresses any methods/options I have to accomplish this
with PINE.

I am using PC-PINE 3.95 under Windows 3.1 on an IBM based machine.

Thanks for your help... Jeff

You need to make sure that procmail doesn't deliver to a Tenex folder. 
I pipe messages through tmail for delivery to my non-mbox folders.
Tmail is available in

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z

Note that since Sendmail prepends an mbox "From " line and procmail
keeps it, you need to get rid of that line.  Tmail also uses
"user+folder" syntax to allow direct delivery to a folder. 
Unfortunately procmail doesn't (AFAIK) make the delivery address
available directly, but it does show up in the first Received: header. 
I use the attached .procmailrc rules and script to handle this.  It is
pretty crude, but it gets the job done for me (improvements welcome ;) 

Good luck!

That would not be so strange, since word processing documents usually
don't have line wrapping like text files, but instead are free-flowing
(the line-wrapping symbols only appear at paragraph endings).
Unfortunately, the Internet mail and news format usually does not allow
for free-flowing text (if you ask me, it's a "bug" in the format), you
would need to manually re-format the texts before pasting them into Pine.

Are you using the ASCII quotation marks ("), or "typographical" quotation
marks (code 147 and 148 in ISO 8859-1).

I am new to using Pine and I am having trouble downloading my messages. I

Any help appreciated!

    This is not really a Pine question, because Pine does not do mail
forwarding.  There may be ways to do what you want, but exactly how
will depend on what operating system you are using Pine on.  If you are
on a Un*x-like system, just put a one-line file named .forward in your
home directory containing the email address you want mail forwarded to. 
(Remember to remove it when you get back!)  For other systems you might
need to check other newsgroups.

Using Pine 3.93 running under ULTRIX V4.4 (Rev. 69), I can't seem to
properly unsubscribe from newsgroups.  When I use the D command in the
Folder Index, I'm prompted to confirm the removal, and all appears well. 
But when I restart Pine, the unsubscribed newsgroups reappear. 

In my .newsrc, the unsubscribed newsgroups were !'d.  The only way I could get
Pine to ignore the groups was to delete them from the .newsrc.  Is this
normal? Thanks in advance.

Actually, just manually edit the pinerc so it has a set of empty quotes 
"" where the user-name should be.  This is discussed in the pine tech notes.

hi,

download mails to your home directory by pressing "E". 

view attachments by using "V" and download them by using "S"

hope that works fine,

Although the "New" flag disappears when you read news articles, you have to
"delete" the messages for them not to show up next time.  The name *sounds*
dangerous, but "deleting" an article doesn't do anything evil like cancel
articles -- it just changes the high mark in your .newsrc

Hi,

When I set the character-set as ISO-8859-1, and post articles
to newsgroup with 8bit characters in Subject field, why PINE
insert the string =?ISO-8859-1? in the Subject field, and
turn off the high bit of each character? Is it possible to
disable it? Other news readers do not support this kind of
stuff.

Thank you in advance.


Qin.

Hello eveyone,
I am having great difficulty in access newsgroups. Does anyone know of a 
news server which I can use? The ISP does not provide me with newsgroups 
access.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much, Dinesh.

Hello everyone,
I basically save all the messages I want to a folder. Than I donwload the 
folder filer from the ISP hard disk to mine.

I am using MS-DOS system. How can read the email, which are on my hard disk?

Also I was wondering whether all the information which one sees when view 
the message with a rich header, is also available through the files?

Thank you,

Regards, Dinesh.

A 'To:' address is not necessary. If the 'To:' field is blank, Pine puts 
the string

empty-header-message     = "To? To you, of course! :)"

(( default-value is 'Undisclosed recipients'. I have modified it above
to what I wanted))

Hello:
	Is the feature 'enable-mouse-in-xterm' functional in pine 3.92? On
my SGI Irix 5.3 the cursor sits motionless in the corner of the xterm. (If
I understood the help text well, I should be able to use the mouse to
select commands.) I will be grateful for any hints on how to make this
feature work.

Not sure if it might be system specific, but using Pine under Solaris
2.4 or 2.5, if a new instance of Pine is run by the same user, it
will try to claim the lock, and the other instance would become read-only.

    From the Main Menu, go into your personal configuration and make
sure you have aggregate commands enabled.  Then, when viewing the index
listing for a newsgroup, just enter the sequence  ;aad
This will mark all messages as read.  If you want the messages to
disappear from the display ("expunged"), add an  x  at the end of that
sequence.  (Depending on your hookup, you may have to enter the four or
five characters one at a time.)

I seem to recall some bugs in 3.93 that might be related to this...
Please see if it happens in 3.95.

That is one question where my attitude is: If you can't find it out by
yourself, you don't need to know.

If you want to find out by yourself, I suggest you check in the
Setup/Config menu, press ? at any option to get help about it.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

You can also do something very simple -- put an invalid character in
your e-mail address.

For example, my e-mail address would be <Jeff.Garzik@spinne.com*>

Bulk mailers are, by their definition, automated.  When they add your
e-mail address to their database and then try to send mail to it, mail
will bounce.  This also stops malicious people who use a hacker program
to subscribe you to every mailing list on the Internet.

The downside of this is that every person replying privately to an
article you wrote must edit the address, or their mail too will bounce. 
It's also a pain for Netscape people, because they can't have separate
news and e-mail origin addresses.

Subject: Problems retrieving mail (named's fault?)
Date: 7 Dec 1996 21:59:59 GMT
Message-ID: <01bbe3a8$85626690$0100007f@srobertson>

Hi,

I have an interesting problem with mail...

For about 2 weeks now we have been using smail for our office email system.
We have Win95 clients (using pop3) and pop3d on the Linux server.
Everything was working fine.

Then, today I set up a nameserver... :-(

The problem is that now our mail clients are unable to connect to the
server to retrieve mail.
The mail clients start up ok.  But when I press the Send/Receive button in
either 
MS Internet Mail (or MS Exchange), a message pops up saying "The connection
was unexpectedly 
terminated by your mail server....."

Some points:
- The name server is working correctly.  That is, Win95 clients that are
configured to use my name server
  are able to correctly resolve hostnames to IP-addresses.  

- The problem occurs on all machines, regardless of whether or not they are
configured to use the name
  server (we were using local hosts files on all of the machines...).

- If I kill named on the server, the problem goes away immediately.

- We are using diald and the ip-masquerading features of Linux to allow the
Win95 clients to access
  the web as though we had a leased line.  That works perfectly.  I tested
this with some clients directly
  contacting our ISP's name servers, and with other clients contacting my
name server (in which case my
  name server contacts our ISP's name servers on their behalf).  As I say,
this all works correctly.

- I suspect that the problem has to do with the pop3 mail retrieval and not
with SMTP mail delivery (i.e. smail
  itself) because if I watch the sockets opened on the linux machine, I
only see POP3 connections being
  established by the Win95 clients....

- The problem is the same whether or not I include an MX record in
named.hosts.  I shouldn't think this would
   make much difference, anyways, because the clients are able to directly
contact the mail server... besides,
   the MX records don't have anything to do with POP3, do they?

- The problem is the same whether or not I hardcode the POP server
IP-address or use a hostname (which is then
   resolved by DNS).

Is there something really simple that I've done wrong (i.e., am I just
being plain stupid), or is there something
more subtle going on here?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Stuart Robertson.

Hi!  Please help if you can?

I need to run PINE on an HP9000 w/ HP-UX 9.04 running many <too many>
Wyse terminals.  I think 50's and 150's, possibly 60's?

The binary seems to work fine, but the cursor up and down keys do not
work as expected.  Any ideas?

Thanks!

  Put the list of addresses in the BCC field, and put at least 1 address

Message-ID: <58241m$7hnu@piglet.cc.uic.edu>

I recently installed pine 3.95 for our users and we are having a big
problem. About 25% of the time, when you hit Compose or Reply, pine will
seemingly lock up. Sometimes, you can do ^L to refresh the screen.
Sometimes, you have to do ^Z and then fg to get the screen to refresh.
And on rare occasions, you have to kill pine.

This is happening on our AIX machine running 4.1.4 compiled with cc. If
there's a patch for this, I'd appreciate a tip. Thanks!

    Simply put in in your personal configuration.  There is
plenty of online help if you don't know how to do that.  (This
is an old, old question.)

At school I use Pine. But winter break is coming up and I won't be able to 
get to my mail. However, I have an AOL account and was wondering if there 
was any way to forward all of my Pine mail to my AOL account.

Thanks in advance

I am asking for help to find my stored files.  After deleting the selected
files I mistakenly said YES to the question "Do you want to store your

Please help me, I am distressed.

thanks, erin

So would this seem to be a bug? An oversight? Worthy of a Bug report?
Seeing how the composer should be able to justify in either COMPOSE or

This seems to happen to quite a few people, since I have received mostly

Thanks for your reply,

  Use the "vacation" program, if it is installed on your system.
  Type "man vacation" for some system-dependent information.

Yes, just make sure that you are not subscribed to any list servs  
when you use vacation, otherwise the whole group may get email  
whenever you send a message -- or the person who sent it to the  
list.

Sure, use "pico" to create a file called ".forward" in your home  
directory.

Put the email address in the .forward file.  Ie if your AOL account  
is "eman@aol.com"

then put "eman@aol.com" in the .forward (no " marks, of course)

Hi

Can someone tell me how to setup an auto reply? I'm using elm and have 
the following .vacation.msg and .forward files.

.vacation.msg :

You're mail regarding ...

.forward :

\anantha, |/usr/bin/vacation anantha

It still doesn't seem to work. Does it work only with pine???

Thanks in advance.

Anantha

I recently switched to getting my mail via pop instead of via local
disk.  Unfortunately it doesn't check for new mail on the pop server on
a regular basis like it used to.  Is this possible?

I've tried it with my INBOX and as well as another folder.  As my INBOX
I need to quit pine to get it to check my mail again.  As a standard
folder it works better, but I need to switch to another folder and back
to the pop one to get it to check for new pop mail.

This is with Pine 3.95.

That might depend on how those PC users are connected to your network.  If
they have access to some type of shared network drive (NFS, whatever) you
could possibly point the PC clients to a global address book which resides
there.  That's the only semi-efficient way I know of to do what you want,
unless your PCs are also NIS clients or something similar to get at your
password file to match the GECOS field when doing the lookup.

Don't forget that one of the "big sources" that you have to change is
sendmail and whatever program (/bin/mail, mail.local, etc.) that you call
from sendmail to deliver the mail.

imapd doesn't lock that way because the author of imapd thinks it's a good
idea.  The author of imapd thinks it's a terrible idea.  But if he expects
mail delivery to leave the mailbox alone when imapd is doing an update, he
has to play by the rules established by UNIX mail delivery software.  One
of those rules are to use lock files in /var/spool/mail. 

The same holds true for MMDF or whatever other mail delivery system you
use.

Hi there:

This isn't so much a suggestion is it is a very quick question.

I was just curious as to how often PINE 3.94 cycles in its attempts to
resend email that is initially unable to reach it's destination.  Every
hour, every 2 hours....??

Thanks.

Yes it is. At least I've done it (in the Linux, SunOS, MS-DOS, Win16 and

Sure... but you need some decent space... It takes 2697984 bytes on

    It all depends on what you want to do.  For the tasks I wish to 
use the aggregate commands for, the current setup has been not only
adequate but fast and easy.  I suspect that, like many things in life,
Pine's design contains a few trade-offs.

Currently, if the username is not set on the pinerc file, it would prompt
for it and modify the pinerc file with it making it the default.

Could there be a way to leave the default username blank, then use the
username and default imap server for the reply address ?

This would be very helpfull in a lab environment, where users vary from
session to session.  Since they still need to log into the IMAP server,
there wouldn't be any problem with security.

    This is not a Pine question, because Pine is not intended to do the
sort of thing you are inquiring about.  There may be various ways of
doing what you want to do.  Because you appear to be writing from an
educational institution, I would suggest inquiring of the help desk or
information center or whatever they have set up to help users.  (Most
universities of any quality have them.)  There are too many variables,
and you did not provide enough information, even if your question were
relevant to this group.

the Win16 version, PCW, it gets it there.

	Never.

	Once pine (a User Agent) hands over the email to an MTA (Message
Transport Agent), e.g. sendmail, MMDF, PMDF, etc., it is the job
(responsibility) of the MTA to retry delivery.  Normally, the retry
time is set to something around 15minutes with a max. of 72 hours
at each MTA.

I don't think it's a bug; I think it's a feature.  No, really.  The
reply-indent-string is (theoretically) only of special significance during
a REPLY.  Justification using CTRL-J works just fine in both REPLY and
COMPOSE modes; it just doesn't pay special attention to the
reply-indent-string during COMPOSE mode.

It would be nice if Pine kept track of the current mode when a message gets
postponed, so that resuming that message returned you to the appropriate
(REPLY or COMPOSE) mode.  This would, I think, solve the problem of
continuing a postponed reply and having CTRL-J "misbehave."

Enable the 'enable-aggregate-command-set' feature in Pine.
Use 
 ;AAD

[
; = Select command
A = All articles
A = Apply comand

to mark all the articles are read.

Subject: PINE and newsgroup subject threading
Date: 9 Dec 1996 11:31:59 +1100
Message-ID: <58fmlv$sth@lios.apana.org.au>


When using PINE to read articles in newsgroups, is it possible to configure
it to correctly sort and index news articles in a group according to the
progress of subject threads? I use NN extensively because it's support of
subject threading is very good. 

PINE doesn't seem to have any support for subject threading at all. The
articles are presented in the order that the NNTP server provides them.

Is support for subject threading something that other people would like to
see in future releases? I think it's important because for PINE to be a
universal solution it needs to support features which make newsreading more
intuitive.

Regards,

Craig.

I have two separate SCO boxes running mmdf and pine. One will expunge 
messages from the inbox (and any other folder) the other will not. I have 
looked at and compared all the permissions on all the files/programs 
involved (at least all the ones I know about). These were
	/usr/spool/mail/???? 
	/tmp
	/usr/bin/pine

The version of pine is a precompiled version from cac.washington.edu: v3.91


Nothing appears to _me_ to be different. That's not to say they aren't 
and quite obviously there is a difference between the configurations. But 
I'll be b******d if I can see it! I have had a look at locking and can't 
see anything. I have had a look at the .pine-debug files with -d9 set. Nada.

The annoying thing is that it says it it doing it all ok, but then the 
messages are there again when I re-enter pine. 

I have logged on as root and the same thing happens. I have set the uid 
and guid for pine itself to root. Zip.

Someone please help as either my forehead or the screen is going to break 
in the not too distant future. All suggestions gratefully received...

TIA
Nick.

NN ignores entries that have been marked with '!' replacing the ':' in
.newsrc, and I'd assumed PINE did the same thing. Maybe this was fixed in
one of the later versions?

Has anyone looked at the possibility of porting Pine to either Java
or a CGI ?  This would enable e-mail access to an IMAP server from within
a browser...

I've seen at least one such thing but going the POP route...

  In PINE 3.95, from the main menu, choose Setup, then Configuration.

Look for "OPTION: Customized-Headers".  From the PINE online help:
	 You may add your own custom headers to all outgoing
	messages.  Each header you specify here must include the
	header tag (Reply-To:, Approved:, etc.) and may optionally
	include a value for that header.  If you want to see these
	custom headers each time you compose a message, you must
	add them to your default composer headers list (see
	above), otherwise they become part of the rich header set
	which you only see when you press the rich header (Ctrl-R)
	command.

i.e., I could use:
	Reply-To: Vincent Hancock <vincent.hancock@twsubbs.twsu.edu> 
to encourage replies to my alternate address.

  BTW, did you realize that you can use PINE as your news reader?  I'm
using it right now to reply to you and cross-post to the news group at
the same time :-)  With that in mind, please send any personal replies
via e-mail (I don't read news that often.)

I thought 3.95 was the current.  Is 4.0 out?  Maybe he is a beta

I want to set up "Collections" to save folders by subject.

I was able to set up a second collection, by adding, in Setup,
Configuration the name of the collection, namely: MTB, ie:
 
 
folder-collections       = mail/[]
                            MTB/[]
 
I restarted Pine. 

Now, when I try to save a message or add a new folder in the MTB
collection I get a message as folows:


 [Can't create mailbox MTB/accident: No such file or directory]


 
(The screen looks like this):
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Incoming Message Folders
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 INBOX
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Folder-collection <mail/[]>  ** Default for Saves **
 (Local)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                       [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Folder-collection <MTB/[]>
 (Local)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                       [ Select Here to See Expanded List ]
 
 
I'd certainly appreciate any early advice. Have been unable to get from
the help screens. Thank you

    By what means do you get the 8-bit characters into the subject
field?  (I saw the ones you entered without difficulty: =E5=E4=F6.  The
message body is easy when using an appropriate alternate editor.)  I
think it is interesting that the MIME headers still marked your post as
US-ASCII.  Apparently Pine does not look at the headers when deciding
whether to flag the message as something other than US-ASCII.  (Also,
unfortunately, I have been told that "officially" Usenet is still
7-bit, like email, and that not all news transporters reliably pass
MIME headers.)

Have you remembered to create the "MTB" directory (at your command prompt,
outside of Pine)?

The folder collection string "MTB/[]" means "the folder (whatever) in the
directory MTB in my home directory".  Whilst Pine is prepared to create
the folder file if it doesn't already exist, it isn't willing to create
the directory itself.

Personally I use a somewhat sneaky trick of putting my folder collection
directories inside my "Mail" directory in my home directory, and giving
them names beginning with a ".".  This makes them invisible to most Pine
functions so they're out of the way, but configured into the
mail-collections variable they work just fine.  This MAY mean they'll be
easier to migrate to when true hierarchical folders come along.

Cheers,

I remember seeing a UNIX mail system where if a message was sent to a
list of users, and one of the addresses in the list was unreachable,
then all attempts to deliver the message to the addresses following the
unreachable one were delayed until the address became reachable - which
often didn't happen.

I've forgotten the details, though, including which flavor of UNIX it was.

If this is the problem, the solution is to edit all permanently unreachable
addresses out of the list, and move the temporarily unreachable ones to
the end of the list.

I had a user ask me about using ispell with pine, so if I
	setenv SPELL "ispell -x"
all I get is the syntax from ispell on how to use it. Is this a known
bug in pine 3.95 or should I be using some other options or?

I suspect the problem is that you haven't yet created the MTB directory.
Setting the "folder-collections" identifies files in the MTB directory as
mail folders, but the directory itself must exist.  Exit Pine and create
the directory at the system level, then re-enter Pine.

This works, but for the novice user who wants to see it on his folder list,
are there any plans in the pine team to address this issue?

         STARTING A MAILING LIST AS A $50,000.00 A MONTH 
BUSINESS

This is a real opportunity to make BIG money fast and begin your 
own
home-based business at the same time. Read the information below 
and follow
the guidelines exactly. You too will be on your way to making 
your
financial dreams a reality! This program was given to me and now 
I am
sharing it with you. Give it a chance and you too will make the 
money you
need to get the life you want and deserve. I have already seen 
the money
coming in from it. This program takes very little time and 
energy to put
into action, and it REALLY works! So, if you want to make allot 
of money
and start your own business at the same time, then GO FOR IT!

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow these instructions EXACTLY and in 20-60 days you will 
have received
well over $50,000.00 cash in the mail. This program has remained 
successful
because of the INTEGRITY and HONESTY of its participants. This 
business is
that of generating mailing lists. You may have heard of Mailing 
list houses
that rent names of prospective buyers to companies with products 
to sell.
Well you are going to develop a mailing list that you can rent 
or sell to a
list house yourself. All the while receiving income from those 
who want to
be on your list. You make money two ways. First, by those who 
will pay you
to be on your list and second, by those who want to rent or buy 
your list.
Here is how you develop your list. Remember, you must follow the
instructions EXACTLY.

1.) Mail $1.00 to each of the names on the list below. SEND CASH 
ONLY!
(Total investment $5.00) Enclose a note with your dollar 
stating, "Add me
to your mailing list". Include your name and address. This is a 
legitimate
service you are requesting and you are paying $1.00 for the 
service.

LIST OF NAMES TO SEND TO:

1. David Moore        33 Aldrich Rd.     Columbus, OH 43214
2. Laurel Kelly       4533 Niagra Ave.   San Diego, CA 92107
3. Chris Zasarno      5313 NW 53 CI      Coconut Creek, Fl. 
33073
4. Darrin Mc Laughlin PO Box 261312      San Diego, CA 92196
5. Toliver Enterprise PO Box 1006	Vallejo, CA 94590

2.) Print out this page. Remove the name that appears as number 
1 on the
list. Move the other 4 names up one position (Number 2 becomes 
number 1,
number 3 becomes number 2 and so on). Place your name, address 
and zip code
in the number 5 position. ( you can use a photocopier to do 
this)

3. With your name in the number 5 position you are now ready to 
begin
developing your own mailing list. There are two ways to do this. 
The first
is to Bulk E-mail this same document to as many E-mail addresses 
as
possible. The recipients will then intern do the same while 
sending you
$1.00 to be on your mailing list. The second way of developing 
the list (
which I feel is more effective) is to purchase a mailing list 
from a list
house ( or from GRQ, we have names of people who are already 
actively
involved in this program and they are the ones most likely to 
participate
again) for a nominal fee. We suggest purchasing at least 500 
names. The
usual cost is approximately $30.00 for names already printed on 
mailing
labels. You can buy fewer names but your return will be less.

4. Print out this document at any Kinkos or any print shop. 
Enclose a copy
of this document in an envelope to all of the names supplied 
from the list
house. Stamp and mail it to all 500 names. As the recipients 
repeat the
process, you will begin receiving $1.00 bills in the mail along 
with a note
asking to be placed on your mailing list.

5.) Within 60 days you will have received over $50,000.00 in 
CASH. Keep a
copy of this file for yourself and use it over and over again as 
you need
money. This is a service and is perfectly legal. It is within 
the
guidelines of Title 18, sections 1302 and 1341 of the Postal 
Lottery Laws.
NOTE: Make sure that you keep EVERY name and address you 
receive. Do not
discard them. These are your proof of being in the mailing list 
business.
Those names are your source of continued income. Most List 
brokers will
want to see the actual envelopes and notes sent to you to be 
sure that they
are bona fide list members.

Remember, each time the program is followed exactly, five 
members will be
reimbursed as List Developers with $1.00 each. Your name will 
move up the
list and in a short time you will be receiving thousands of 
dollars in
CASH.

THIS PROGRAM FAILS ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT HONEST!!! PLEASE BE 
HONORABLE... IT
DOES WORK!! GOOD LUCK!!!

I would like to request information on the ISO 8859-1 character set. 
Your address was mentioned as a possible source of this character set on 
my www search.

I write in American English on the Internet.  I also write in German on 
the Internet, and all German messages I send out lack specific German 
characters.  When I receive from family members, friends and colleagues 
from Germany messages, they always come with a preface indicating that 
the messages have been sent in the ISO 8859-1 character set and have been 
translated into the ASCII character set.  When I receive that message, I 
get the whole German message intact, with all Umlauts and other unique 
German characters.  But I cannot reply with all of the characters 
intact in the whole message.  It occurs to me that I must use that same 
character set, instead of the ASCII character set.  I have received 
messages from American colleagues in the USA with that same preface, 
they write in the ISO 8859-1 character set, quoting German text within      
otherwise English text.  That is, when one writes with the ISO 8859-1 
set, one can also write English in addition to German.  The German 
alphabet simply has more characters than English.

Please inform me as to how I can get and use this character set.  I use 
here at Sage the Pine system, for which reason I write to you.

Please respond.

Sincerely,

not another GOOD TIME virus type... I still get them messages

If you are not afraid of compiling the source, you can find a pop3 server
in the pine package.  This should be available on any of the linux distri-
bution ftp sites.  I have done that for a Motorola Delta box and it works
fine as a pop server.  Another possibility is "popper", but I dont
remember where to find that one.  Maybe you should ask archie, the archie
program. 

Best of luck, Villy

Somewhere on the readme files, it specifies why it was compiled that
way.

Simply run pine with the -d 0 switch.

Or simply, rename pine to say pine-real and then create a 'pine' script
that calls 'pine-real -d 0'

I use Pine 3.91 not only for email, but to read my newsgroups as well.  
For the last several months, I have been unable to add any new newsgroups 
to my folder list.  Is this a bug that was fixed by a later version of 
Pine?  Or are there settings that I need to do to my PINE program that 
would fix the problem?  I think that I probably have the configuration 
correct though since I am able to read the few newsgroups I was able to 
gather when I first started here in a normal manner.

Oops...in my post I said that UNIX Pine version 3.95 gave the same
results as the other versions but it really gives the following:

In the "Folders List" after trying to add a new folder with
   {darkwing.csun.edu/user=marc.montemorra}INBOX
I get "[rsh to IMAP server timed out]" and then
   HOST: darkwing.csun.edu  USER: marc.montemorra  ENTER PASSWORD:
I enter my password and then get 
   [CREATE failed: Can't create mailbox INBOX: mailbox already exists]

What am I doing wrong?  Any help would be appreciated.  Please post

Message-ID: <584nd3$r8f@andromeda.rutgers.edu>

I recently began using pine as a newsreader. In the past, I have always
used 'nn' and when I wanted to mark all headers in a group read, I would just
hold <shift>-X. Is there any equivalent to that command in pine or are we
expected to individually 'delete' each header?

Maybe it's the same problem as that with printers which was discussed here
some time ago?
What I guess: if you call your speller from within pine, it is accessed via
a pipe, so it gets its input from stdin, not from a file, similar to:

cat {temporary file} | ispell -x

If so, you have to check if and how ispell can handle this correctly.
If not -- well, this was just a suggestion ...

I believe the "official" way of using a different spell checker within
Pine is to set it up in Pine's Setup Configuration screen.  There you will
find a variable called "speller" (complete with built-in context sensitive
help!) which can be set up to invoke your spell checker.

Here our ispell program lives in the /usr/local/pub directory, so we have
speller set to:

speller                  = /usr/local/pub/ispell

Cheers,

Finding the ulusive(?) Bcc: header...

1.  Put cursor on any message header line when composing a message.

2.  Look at command menu at bottom of screen.

3.  Gasp in astonishment at the "^R Rich Header" item shown there.

4.  Try typing ^R and be amazed at the appearance of all the available
    headers (including Bcc:)

:-)

Festive Cheers!

It is a typical problem for the Russians. They have a patch at

ftp://ftp.kiae.su/unix/mail/pine3.95-rus-2b.diff.gz

Those patches enable an option not to encode the 8bit header and 
an option not to encode the 8bit body

The patched binary for x86 sun-solaris2.5 may be found at
ftp://mail.sagantec.co.il/pub/i386-sun-solaris2.5/pine3.95-koi-i386-sun-solaris25.tar.gz

There was also a discussion (in Russian) on the matter in the group
news://relcom.fido.ru.unix under the thread name 
"pine, that dog, doesn't want to send Russian letters"

Usually, you can get rid of it by exiting from the system and re-logging
into the system. You can use "quota -v kasap" to check if it works.
Good luck.

Is there a precompiled binary of pine for Power Mach 4.0.3? I cannot 
locate it on your ftp server.

HELP WANTED!!

I am installing pine 3.95 on solaris unix. We have about 300 end users.
The problem I am having has to do with the addressbook. It is my impression
that the addressbook will allow you to assign many email address to 
one single name. For example I create a group called managmnt. In this 
group I include ten addresses all seperated by a comma in the addressbook.
When I attempt to mail the group I get the following error: 


	[Mail not sent. Sending error: 451 queuename: Cannot create "qfOAA16490]



It is my initial thought that this may be a permissions issue within the
system itself.


Is it necessary to have any additional software to mail to groups or will
pine and unix together do the job.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Hello my name is tigh
and I use the program pine...I can't get much help from the system cause 
they don't use pine that often.  I want to change the from line to my 
alias on the system but haven't been able to figure out how to do it.  I 
know I can put a reply to header but I still would like to put 
tigh@navix.net on the from category...Does the pine configuration also 
configure Network News or tin????  Because when I post messages on tin I 
want just my name to appear instead of my account which is 
tb62719@navix.net  Any help would be appreciated!!!

Thanks!

Well, I have to admit I haven't read the nntp and related RFC's
for a while, but regarding the use of mime and smtp, the "subject"
field is not encoded, and thus not allowed to be anything else
that 7bit. So this (the subject line in this thread) is the right 
way to express it.

That is also why the posting was US-ASCII, since the message 
body was not 8bit (this was commented by someone else).  

Um, hope I didn't miss the whole point here, just reading very
quickly through the messages...

Message-ID: <58idlh$nhi@janis.virago.org.au>

hello,

There seems to be a problem with the Reply-To: header in PINE 3.95.
We have seen this problem on one Solaris 2.5 two 2.5.1 and one linux
2.0.27 machines.
All four machines were using sendmail 8.8.3/8.8.4 
but I saw it happen on a machine that originally had sendmail 8.7.5.

The problem is when someone sends mail to an acct that only exists as an
alias or has a .forward file.  When the ultimate recipient 
selects to reply to the address in the Reply-To: line, PINE
seems to actually use  either the original sender (FROM:) or 
the alias/.forward recipient (To:) 

This behaviour is inconsistant in that for some addresses Pine works
exactly as expected...


Why???
Is some thing broken somewhere or is this a feature?

rachel

    Yes.  The receiving system "decides" whether it will honor the
request for a return receipt, depending on how the system administrator
set it up.  Some systems honor the request and some do not.  At the
present time, there is no way you can force a remote system to give you
a receipt.  (And in case anybody asks, no, there is no way at present
to force any system to tell you that your recipient has actually opened
and read your message.  A few proprietary systems do this, but you
cannot do it on the Internet in general.)

Hi

I am new to this newsgroup so please forgive me if this has already been
covered.  Can anyone tell me what is the latest version of Pine mail for
Unix?  Also is it possible to get a pre-compiled copy for use under SCO
Unix - Release 5?  If so where from?

Any help would be much appreciated.

It is a typical problem for the Russians. They have a patch at

ftp://ftp.kiae.su/unix/mail/pine3.95-rus-2b.diff.gz

Those patches enable an option not to encode the 8bit header and 
an option not to encode the 8bit body

The patched binary for x86 sun-solaris2.5 may be found at
ftp://mail.sagantec.co.il/pub/i386-sun-solaris2.5/pine3.95-koi-i386-sun-solaris25.tar.gz

There was also a discussion (in Russian) on the matter in the group
news://relcom.fido.ru.unix under the thread name 
"pine, that dog, doesn't want to send Russian letters"

Hi there. I am running MkLinux on a PowerMac and I haven't been able to
find a suitable pine that will compile. The only Linux Pine I see anywhere
is the i386 binary, which will not work for me since I have a PowerPC chip.

Any pointers?

Hi,

I have just installed mail filtering via filter and it works fine.
 =20
There is just one problem:
 =20
when I recieve a mail into the main inbox, I get a message "New Mail...".
When a mail gets filtered and therefor gets into a additional inbox, I
don't get this message. I can however scan for new mails using the
tab-key, but that's not the same.
 =20
Anyone a clue ?

Ciao,

We are in the process of moving our mail server from a linux system
running Pine 3.91 to a Solaris x86 2.5.1 system running Pine 3.95.  We
will tar and ftp the users home directories and the mail directory over
to the new machine.  

I notice that the .pinerc file is substantially larger on the Pine 3.95
system.  If we do a straight tar and ftp the .pinerc file from the 3.91
version will be moved over.  Will this cause a serious problem?  If so
how should I handle it.  We have approximately 400 user accounts on the
system.

Subject: Ctrl-x problem with Pine mailer
Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail for Windows (v2.23)
Message-Id: <72869417C6@coastal.edu>

On our Alpha 3000/500 (DU 4.0) we have Pine 3.91.  All functionality 
in Pine works fine on the server.  However, when sessions connect 
through our Decserver 90M terminal server we lose the functionality 
of Ctrl-X and Ctrl-O (Vital commands in Pine). 

I've tested the Windows 3.1 terminal session parameters to no avail.  
From scanning pine mail archives it appears that the terminal server 
is the culprit.  It apparently uses those key combinations for other 
operations and filters them out before the transmission reaches the 
server.  

Has anyone else experienced this on their systems?  If so, do you 
know what commands we can give the terminal server to let that 
traffic through?  Or, any other workarounds?  Thanks in advance.

Hi,

I can't find a way to specify a remote folder (accessed through IMAP) so
that it will appear in the "Folder List" window. Is such a thing possible
?

Message-ID: <58jk1o$qtg@gamera.cbl.cees.edu>

Is it possible to get Pine to use a file containing e-mail addresses as an
'address list?'

I operate a small 'classifieds' web area and like to send reminders to the
advertisers to let me know when they no longer need an ad (the ads are
free and there is no time limit).  I can grep the "mailto:" address and
put the addresses into a file, but I can't seem to find a way to get Pine
to use it.

(On reflection, maybe I should pose this question in a 'spammers'
newsgroup :-) ).

Pine is not able to constantly monitor mail outside of your main INBOX.  
Thus, you are forced to use the tab key.

Date: 11 Dec 1996 19:00:00 GMT
Message-ID: <slrn5au15g.o3i.rnortman@huitzilo.tezcat.com>

Is there a way to get Pine (I'm using 3.95) to use DSN (Delivery
Status Notification) if the MTA supports it?

FYI: DSN provides a way for the sender of a message to be notified
upon successful, failed, and/or delayed delivery of the message.  Note
that this is for delivery (the message was placed in the users mail
spool), not receipt (the user's MUA received the message).

It's part of RFC 1891 (Jan 1996), "SMTP Service Extension for Delivery
Status Notifications."  Related RFC's are 1892 and 1894.  It replaces
the Return-Receipt-To header, which was never standard AFAIK.

TIA

Netscape adds a "References:" header in a reply message.  It references the
message ID of the message that is being replied to.  

I was wondering if this was a semi-standard header? Is there is any way to
enable it in the current version of pine? Is there a reason that it is not
going to be used at some time?  (Netscape has been known to do things wrong
in the past)  etc...

I like the way Netscape will thread messages that have the references
header, but I seem to do half of my mail work in pine.

$$$$ $50,000 for the New Year $$$$

Take five minutes to read this and it WILL change your life.
 
The Internet has grown tremendously. It doubles in size every 4 months. think about it. You see those 'Make.Money.Fast' posts more and more.
That's ... because it WORKS !  So I thought, all those new users might
make it work. And I decided to try it out, a few months ago. Besides,
whats $5.00, I spend more than that in the morning on my way to work
on coffee and cigs for the day. So I sent in my money and posted.Everyone was calling it a scam, but there are SO many new users from AOL, Netcom, etc. they will join in and make it work for you.

Well, two weeks later, I began recieving bucks in the mail!  I
couldn't believe it! Not just a little, I mean big bucks!  At first only a few hundred dollars, then a week later, a couple of thousand, then BOOM.
By the end of the fourth week, I had recieved nearly $47,000.00. It came
from all over the world. And every bit of it perfectly legal and on
the up and up. I've been able to pay off all my bills and still had
enough left over for a nice vacation for me and my family.

Not only does it work for me, it works for other folks as well. Markus
Valppu says he made $57,883 in four weeks. Dave Manning claims he
made $53,664 in the same amount of time. Dan Shepstone says it was only
$17,000 for him. Do I know these folks? No, but when I read how they say they did it, it made sense to me. Enough sense that I'm taking a similar chance with $5 of my own bucks. Not a big chance, I admit--but one with incredible potential, because $5 is all anyone ever invests in this system. Period. That's all Markus, Dave, or Dan invested, yet their $5 netted them tens of thousands of dollars each, in a safe, legal, completely legitimate way. Here's how it works in 3 easy steps:

STEP 1.

Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate
pieces of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST."
(In this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone; you're paying
for a legitimate service.) Fold a $1 bill inside each paper, and mail them by standard U. S. Mail to the following five addresses:
 
 1-Aaron McDaniel
     2014 Powell Dr.
     ElCajon, Ca 92020 

 2-Faroon Khan
     12343 77A Avenue
     Surrey, BC V3W2W9

 3-Hoffman Eric
     3150 Riviere-Cachee
     Boisbriand, PQ
     Canada
     J7H 1A3

 4-Stuart Koch  
     Connolly Hall Box C115
     501 E. St. Joseph
     Rapid City, SD 57701-3995

 5-Karen Lundgren
     3889 Kencrest Ave.
     Halifax, NS
     Canada
     B3K 3L4

STEP 2.

    Now remove the top name from the list, and move the
    other names up.This way, #5 becomes #4 and so on.
    Put your name in as the fifth one on the list.


STEP 3.

    Post the article to at least 250 newsgroups. There are at
    least 19000 newsgroups at any given moment in time.
    Try posting to as many newsgroups as you can. Remember
    the more groups you post to, the more people will see your
    article and send you cash!


STEP 4.

    You are now in business for yourself, and should start seeing
    returns within 7 to 14 days! Remember, the Internet is new
    and huge. There is no way you can lose.
 
    Now here is how and why this system works:
 
    Out of every block of 250 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.
 
    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 250
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings. On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!
 
    Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 250 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!
 
    Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.
 
    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

                The end result depends on you. You must follow through
                and repost this article everywhere you can think of.
                The more  postings you  make, the more cash ends up in
                your mailbox. It's too easy and too cheap to pass up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it. Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily. Try to keep
    an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

    If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
    for real, then don't do it. But please print this article and pass
    it along to someone you know who really needs the bucks, and see
    what happens.

    REMEMBER....HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.YOU DON'T
    NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE THE BUCKS!
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL, AND PLEASE PLAY FAIR AND YOU WILL
    WIN AND MAKE SOME REAL INSTANT FREE CASH!

*** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the bucks to the people
already included, you will not get much. I know someone who did this
and only got about $150 (and that's after two months). Then he sent
the 5 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had
over $10,000!

                TRY IT AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY!!!  :o) !!!!!!!!!!

I just set the prYnt command to pipe the message to approve.pl
<ftp://sparky.sterling.com/moderators>

You need to turn on full headers before prYnting for this to work.
Since the user we have moderating a group is decidedly non-technical
I hacked a copy of pine to always run in full header mode for him.

I'm using PINE 3.95 for UNIX. Whenever I try to edit my configuration, it

What the name of the config file and where does it reside?

Is there a blind carbon copy function in pine 3.91? 
If so, where is it and how is it used?

Thanks,

I have those rules installed and use Pine.  Works just fine.  However,
Pine lets user configure their domain name for the From: line.  I doubt
they would all set it to something goofy, but maybe your rules like
user, user@localhost, user@host and user@host.domain but do not
like user@domain.

Take a look in your syslog, the bounces get recorded there so you should
be able to see what the rule doesn't like.

If you want to do this as a systemwide default, the easiest way is to edit
env_unix.c and change the value of mbx_protection.

At least this is what you do in the latest imap-4.1 toolkit.  Pine 3.94 is
very old, and probably uses imap-3.5.  It looks like mbx_protection is in
dummy.c instead of env_unix.c in that old version.

I expect that Pine 4.00 will support DSN.

I just wrote the c-client support for it earlier this week, and I believe
that my colleagues are working on the user interface portion.

No rush, of course, but when will 4.00 be out?  (Just curiosity; I
understand that things like this generally "take as long as they
take")

(Nice work with Pine in general, BTW.  Great work, actually.)

you can try going to your mail prompt and type "compress".
ie:

MAIL>compress<enter>

After that, delete a file called MAIL.OLD in your directory. what this 
does is that it frees up the space occupied by deleted messages...


It worked for me...:) See my mails on "disk quota problem"

Subject: Pine versions 3.90 and higher and MkLinux

Here is the current situation we are dealing with: 
 
Everytime you attempt to run pine, it will say
Mailbox is open by another process, access is read-only
 
Reading through all the FAQs and prior messages about this type of problem all
point at another instance of pine running. Well, this is after a clean boot...
and ps -aux reveals no copy of pine running. 
 
Checking /var/spool/mail reveals nothing. No lock files or anything.
However, we do notice that /tmp now has a file .803.307
What is happening? We have removed this file, and everytime we run pine
this little file pops up.
 
If anyone can provide assistance, we would appreciate it. By the way, it does
this for every version of pine that we were able to compile on MkLinux DR-2.

First, thanks to the following for their quick responses:

Paul Sand, David Romani, Matt Moore, Fred Lance, Karen Thomas, Bill 
Bathurst, Harlod Lundberg.

The quick fix was to use the ESC ESC X key sequence, which passes 
through the Decserver 90 to the Alpha.  We'll be using the suggested 
modifiactions to the terminal server itself for the long term solution.

Headers available when composing...

The set shown by default (without having to give the ^R Rich Header
command) can be set using the "default-composer-hdrs" in Pine's Setup
Configuration screen.

Turning off the Fcc: folder...

In the Setup Configuration screen ste the "default-fcc" value to the empty
string ("").

On-line help is available for both of these... in the Setup Configuration
screen put the cursor on the item you want to learn about and type "?".

The problem is with a new Pine version which talks SMTP to sendmail,
but uses sendmail -bs. In this case, the ${client_addr} is 0 :-(
So you need to add
R0			$@ ok		client_addr is 0 for sendmail -bs
before
R$={LocalIP}.$*		$@ ok		from here

This solved the problem.  The Web page and the HACKs have been
updated.

I've got the following two lines in my .pinerc file.  If I send to
someone who is getting mail on a sendmail 6.x setup, I get delivery
notices.  If I send to someone who is behind a ccMail gateway, I get
actial read receipts.  

customized-hdrs=Return-Receipt-To: William C Bonner <wbonner@lgx.com>,
        Bcc: William C Bonner <wbonner@lgx.com>

The Bcc: is just so that I get more than the Fcc default.

I can't remember a location to lookup RFCs right now, so I am not
positive I'm answering the correct question.

Jean,

For information on specifying an IMAP folder or folder collection in Pine,
see: http://www.washington.edu/pine/user-guide/info/imap.syntax.html

For a single folder, you can add it to your list of "incoming folders"  --
to create that folder list, which then also (and initially only) will
include your INBOX, you need to first check the "enable-incoming-folders"=
=20
feature in the SETUP CONFIGURATION screen; read the context-sensitive help
screen for that feature while you're there.  You could also just type the
IMAP single-folder definition at the "GOTO folder..." prompt (if you have
no need to access a certain remote folder frequently), for example:

=09*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/96-12-11

to look at yesterday's postings to the Net-Happenings mailing list (thanks
to Nancy McGough (posting to Pine-Info on 6 Jul 1996) for discovering that
resource).=20


For *multiple folders stored in the same directory* on an IMAP server,
you'd need to set up a new folder collection, in SETUP CONFIGURATION.  For
example, to set up a folder collection to access the entire archives of the
Pine-Info discussion forum, the IMAP syntax for that folder collection in
Pine is:=20

=09*{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]=20

That way, you could then search the Pine-Info message archives
month-by-month -- say, if you remember seeing something of interest posted
in November or October -- in contrast to the search across all months back
to Jan. 1995 you can perform via the Web page at
http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/

I am trying to run pine 3.95 on a Win95 system at my office. When I
try and connect to the pop server, I get an error message that the
connection was refused.

I can run PC-Pine on my home system to other pop servers. I can also
access the office pop server fron nutscrape's mailer and fron procomm's
mail client.

Any suggestions? Any clues?

Hi,
Thanks for replying,

I have tried compiling using the make and build command.But there are
numerous libraries that are missing in the SCO-XENIX platform which pine
needs for successful compilation.That's the reason why I need help doing
it.If you have any further info please let me know as it is very urgent...

regards,
seema

Pine seems to be "smart" about re-wrapping lines paying attention to the
quote character only when REPLYing to a message.  When you resume a reply,
you're in COMPOSE mode, not REPLY mode.  That's my theory, anyway.

it does, but all the time, whatever i type, it says Spell Checkin' is ok

                           [ Done checking spelling ]

what port does it use to connect... maybe the problem is  that port 
conection is closed on that host? ( i am refering to finger "same "
 message,... when you finger to some hosts, where finger daemon "is dead"
you get the same message

Hi Stefan,

Thank you very much ! Now I got it.

Some suggestions ?
1. In the context-sensitive help for "eneable-incoming-folders", it could
be told that for the server the following syntax is correct:
=09ucmb.ulb.ac.be/usr=3Da_user
2. In the same help, the folder can be INBOX or the full pathname of the
mailbox.
3. In  http://www.washington.edu/pine/user-guide/info/imap.syntax.html
be more explicit about the different places where IMAP addresses can be
used.

Once again, thank you for your help.

Jean

  Yup, I don't think pine support this. But there are applications on every
platform that do (Netscape, tin, YA-Newswatcher, Free-Agent,  Agent). Just
depends on which one you are using.

Az pont ami csinal az IMAP protocol!  (I will continue in English from

That is what IMAP/Pine do.  The mail stays on a remote server.  When you
view the index with Pine on an IMAP server, only the headers are
retrieved.  Only when you select a message for reading/printing/saving,
etc is the body retrieved.

> PS. How could I set up Pine as a POP3 client?

After asking the question that you asked, I don't really understand
why you want to do that, but just specify the remote host for
pine to use with
  {host.name.here/pop3}
in the inbox path.

pine -d 0

The -d option tells PINE to do 0 level debugging, meaning that no debug
files will be made.  If PINE is stable for you, the debug files are
useless.  Of course, the only drawback is that PINE could always
mysteriously crash, which you'll have no debug files for reference.

  Have you tried downloading the source tar file and running the Build
script for regular Linux? I didn't try Pine, but I did run the build script
for Pico and it works fine. I didn't see anything that would lead me to
believe that I couldn't do it.

I have figured out how to get rid of files within a folder in PINE, but
once the folder is empty, how do I delete the empty folder?

Subject: using pipe with dialup ppp

Is there a way to use pine on a dialup line. I have an ISP I use a modem
to connect to. I would like to
compose stuff while disconnected using pine, and then after I connect
push a <SEND> button to transmit
my stuff. I have told pine about my SMPT, etc. but when I compose a
message it barfs when I try to send it. Doesn't seem to be a send-later
switch. Perhaps there is a FAQ I can access somewhere

Thanks!

	Pine does not yet support a "disconnected" mode.  That will come
with the support of IMAP4 in pine4.0.

Just to be extra precise: the IMAP4 support that is being incorporated in
Pine 4.00 is necessary but not sufficient for disconnected operation.
Both offline and disconnected operation is still planned, but won't be
ready for Pine 4.00

 You can access a Public NNTP server (www.yahoo.com, search for 
public usenet) _ONLY_ if you are directly connected
to that NNTP server i.e. if you can do a 
 telnet NNTP_SERVER 119 

Since you are coming thru a ISP, I doubt you can do this. But, if you
can, I too would like to do the exaclt same thing. I am behind
a security firewall and would like to access a public NNTP server.
Please forward any direct emails you get on this to me. Thanks.

Subject: How to access Newgroups from Pine??
Message-ID: <850442293.8293@dejanews.com>

Hi!
I am using pine to send and recv mail and have Internet Shell account.  I would like to know how to access
news groups via Pine.  When I press Ctrl-R from the To: field I get a field for Newgroups also.  But when I enter the name of a newsgroup in it
it says something about no remote news server being defined.
Do I have to create a .newsrc file??  what are all the steps I should under-take in order to access newgroups through Pine??
I would be extremely grateful if somebody could help me on this.
By the way, in  case I have to provide in pine, the name of a remote-news server, kindly also tell me where I can find
them. (I mean the list of remote-news servers)
Thanks in advance
Dilip

'man filter' or 'man procmail' will give you the info you need.

They're an email to fax service, if that is what you are looking for.
Otherwise, you're pretty much stuck.

Being quite new to emailing (and therefore PINE) I was wondering....

When I am in a newsgroup for the first time, and want to delete a hundred
or so messages (so I can get to the last 10!)...

How do I go about doing this????

I would appreciate any advice....

Thanks in advance!

If you mean 'talk', just type 'talk person@whereever.com' if you are using
UNIX or a variant of it.

There are programs for Windows that use Talk, go to http://www.tucows.com/
for a talk program if you are running Windows.

    Make sure you have aggregate commands enabled in your personal
configuration.  (See the online help if you are unsure how to do this.)
Then, from the folder index screen, start an aggregate command.  You
can "apply by the numbers" to delete whatever range of numbers you
want.  It should be pretty apparent if you use the online help.

> I would appreciate any advice....

    One piece of advice would be to try to choose a more informative
subject than merely "Help" next time you post to a newsgroup.

Why are you forwarding everything to e-mail? Please stop that!

It's to indicate what messages are supposed to be marked with a '+' in the
list, i.e directly addressed to you. I have three mail addresses forwarded
to one, and thusly I have set up this keyword to indicate all of those.

Hello,

   I have the Windows 95 version of PC-PINE. My ISP only offers POP3 mail 
retrieval; the help files recommend a UNIX program that will log onto a 
POP3 server and put your mail in your local INBOX; is there a Win95 
program that will perform the same function?

         Hi John de Boer.
 
         I believe to understand their problem.
 
         I on the first part of their problem don't have much
experience.
 
         Above the second part of your problem, does seem me that once
that do
 you have the forty graphic files, is your preoccupation the power
 publish it?
 
         This only could do by program.
 
         The program results something complicated, but if the one which
has is
 manuscripts it then results very complex.

I use filter also.  At login, I have the computer run a little
script file to process the file called "filter-log" and
print out how many messages were sorted into which folders.

Here are my requirements:

o Able to use two internet accounts and one MAPI account together
"seamlessly"
o Able to send "auto-replies" based on rules, etc.
o Able to audibly notify user with a customizable sound file (.wav,
etc.)
o Preferrably freeware (or shareware)

Is there such a product? My environment is Windows NT Workstation 3.51.
The MAPI mailbox is our company's internal email. One of the internet
accounts is our company's own Internet email. The second internet
account is my personal account with an internet service provider.

Thanks in advance

THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST


BECAUSE OF ITS VILENESS, TORTURE SEX IS THE GREATEST CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
IMAGINABLE.  BUT IT ISN'T THE UNFORGIVABLE SIN.  IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT
AFTERWARDS. 
 
 
SUMMARY:  (i) The Biblical evidence for torture sex being the sin against
the Holy Ghost is zilch. The sin is mentioned, but NOWHERE defined. (ii) The
association turns basically on an interpretation by some within the Catholic
Church, which has been enshrined in canon law. Canon law is fallible; it can
and does change. And this interpretation is misguided, as many clergy within
the Catholic Church would concede if presented with the following case.
(iii) Consider a hitman who takes such great chances for a potential
torture-sex victim that he ends up becoming a victim himself. Wouldn't God
love such enormous courage? Wouldn't He be more concerned with what was in
the heart than with what was on the history sheet? Hitmen can find
salvation, and so can you, without necessarily showing such extreme courage.
(iv) For once, BE somebody for the Universe, and not just a brainwashed,
scar(r)ed, nasty little bunny rabbit.

7.  THE AUTHOR'S STARTING AND FINISHING POINTS. 
 
1.  WHAT IS THE AUTHORITY FOR THE "SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST"? 
	The sin against the Holy Ghost (the "unforgivable sin") is mentioned only
in passing in the three "synoptic" Gospels (Matthew 12:32, Mark 3:29 and
Luke 12:10). (Synoptic, "with the one view", because all three Gospels came
from basically the same sources.) It occupies only a verse in each case.
John doesn't write about it at all. In other words, in the prime authorities
of the New Testament, the Gospels, the discussion of the sin against the
Holy Ghost is hardly central. (Check it out for yourself: http://
www.gospelcom.net/ bible) 
	Is the sin against the Holy Ghost (called "blasphemy" in the King James
Version) defined? No, it is not. So HOW did torture sex come to be thought
of as the sin against the Holy Ghost? 
 
2.  IS TORTURE SEX THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	For the few mega-warped medieval "Christians" into torture sex, who felt
themselves to be beyond redemption, the association between the famous
passage of Paul about the body as the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1
Corinthians 6) and the sin against the Holy Ghost was obvious. Mightn't the
sin against the Holy Ghost possibly be...torture sex? 
	Later, some senior people in the Catholic Church, aware of the warped ones,
erroneously thought that it might be too. After all, it was the vilest of
sins. Their quite fallible misinterpretation persists, especially for those
on whom it was imprinted in a state of semi-hysterical gullibility. 
	Now, of course, even if an association between the sin against the Holy
Ghost and the body as the temple of the Holy Ghost might be plausible, that
does not suggest torture sex in the slightest. In fact, reading the rest of
the cited chapters, it might well be concluded with equal logic that, among
other things, being an active gay was the sin against the Holy Ghost. Other
passages of Scripture which might be cited as evidence are even more
distantly related.  
	The Biblical evidence that torture sex is the sin against the Holy Ghost is
anything but compelling. It all turns on the internal "canon law" of the
Catholic Church, which was purely reactive in this case. And Catholic canon
laws are like ordinary laws: they might be enforceable, with certain
"church" penalties, but equally they might be changed tomorrow. Canon law
can and does change. It is not an immutable summary of God's eternal truths. 
	The shallowness of the canon law interpretation in this instance is shown
by consideration of a simple, but true, example. An expert hitman came to
love a potential torture-sex victim as a friend. In attempting to protect
him, the hitman became, almost inevitably, a victim himself. He knew what he
had done in his life, he well knew what the likely penalties for defending
his friend were, but he went ahead anyway.  
	Who would dare suggest that God would reject such a one? Jesus said (of a
simple death): 
		"Greater love hath no man than this, 
		 that a man lay down his life for his friends"	(John 15:13) 
and also: 
		"Inasmuch as ye have done it [for] one of the least of these my
		 brethren, ye have done it [for] me"		(Matthew 25:40). 
The hitman's love and nearly unbelievable courage would have saved him,
baptised him in blood. Nothing he could have been made to do or say in his
last earthly moments could, because of its forced nature, conceivably have
lessened his beauty before God. Indeed, his last free words, facing a horror
beyond natural human description, were to request that no blood be
splattered upon his jumper ("sweater"). It had been given to him by the
friend and, although grubby from overuse on the run, symbolised their
friendship. More importantly, the story of his final courage started to get
around - as he knew it would - and helped protect his friend further. At a
time when most would turn to jelly, with thoughts only of what was to come,
he kept his cool enough to do the single most useful thing within his power
to save another. That shows where his soul was at. 
	So, even though the hitman had engaged in torture sex most of his life
(apparently willingly), he had not committed the unforgivable sin. Even if
that story were not true (and I hate that it is real, although I rejoice in
his heroism and eternal reward), it certainly COULD be. There are people in
this world with such enormous generosity of spirit, even amongst those who
would normally hide self-hatred behind plausible bravado. And, just as the
robber who hung on the cross beside Jesus, they will enjoy paradise (Luke
23:39-43). Only one negative case is needed to prove the point: torture sex
is not the sin against the Holy Ghost.

3.  SO WHAT IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	If Matthew, Mark and Luke didn't bother to define the sin against the Holy
Ghost, some plausible hypotheses for that are: 
	(a) it isn't important in general (hard to believe, since it denies
		salvation), 
	(b) it is so uncommon that it's hardly worth talking about (well,
		perhaps then...), 
	(c) they couldn't write an essay well enough to pass a first year
		Medicine exam (even with Dads who were Doctors), and 
	(d) the readers/listeners for whom they were writing would have
		known straight away what they were talking about. 
The last alternative seems the most likely to me. Their readers/listeners
KNEW what "blasphemy" (the sin) against the Holy Ghost was. And, indeed,
tautological though it might be, it is pretty obvious. 
	Quite simply, the sin against the Holy Ghost is refusing to believe in the
love of God. The Holy Ghost is the spirit of God, the spirit of love, in the
Godhead. "Blasphemy" against the Holy Ghost is denying the possibility of
God's forgiveness. If you don't want it, you can't have it.  
	The readers/listeners for whom they were writing, in the Palestine of the
1st Century AD, would have been very familiar with the Holy Ghost ("the
comforter" in John) as the spirit of love. But would anyone seriously
suggest that there and at that time torture sex was common? Maybe a badly
beaten camel, or a bit of shit-maker in the well, perhaps even the odd
"Murder of the Innocents", but widespread torture sex? Do me a favour! 
	The reality of the sin against the Holy Ghost, however, is not just the
simple denial of God's love once. By its very nature, hopelessness feeds
upon itself. Feeling divorced forever from Universal forgiveness leads
inexorably to an inward spiral of self-hatred and the perpetuation of
self-hating action. Eternal hope is cut off more and more. Unbroken, the
process will complete itself. 
	Where Catholic canon law gets close to the mark is that torture sex is the
most psychologically detrimental sin imaginable (barring the S. against the
H.G.). Accordingly, torture sex is likely to lead to the (real) sin against
the Holy Ghost more than anything else. But do you see the distinction?
Torture sex ISN'T the sin against the Holy Ghost itself, it's just the most
likely to give rise to the feelings that become the sin against the Holy
Ghost. It can be forgiven, but not if hopelessness takes over to the point
where the vision is clouded forever.  
 
4.  WOULD THE LORD OF CHAOS BE INTERESTED? 
	Does Homer like donuts? What kind of Satan would want souls foist upon him?
Surely the real Lord of Chaos would want people to choose him freely:
raunchy chaos over pusillanimous order, that sort of thing. But on the
rebound? Even Satan wants you to get it right about the sin against the Holy
Ghost. Choose the Lord of Chaos, by all means, but CHOOSE. And choice
requires freedom. Know that you haven't committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost...yet. 
	However, if you think about it, the Lord of Chaos would hate torture sex as
much as God does. Since when is rotten, vile, ghastly, fucked-up,
hypocritical and unnatural ORDER equivalent to the pure chaos of "evil"? Is
Satan a hypocrite? Would he want such vile, hypocritical, followers? Such a
fucked-up response to fucked-up medieval Christianity couldn't possibly
describe the Lord of the Universe that I would want to serve. It would be as
false to suggest that that was Satanism as it would be to put forward that
the sale of indulgences was Christianity. Further, if Satan were to have a
motto, it would surely be "give the cunts hell". Guess who the cunts are?
Instead of being rewarded, those who continue to advocate such patently
false Satanism will, if there are levels to hell, go straight to the bottom
for eternity. They are traitors to God and Satan alike.
 
5.  ACHIEVING FORGIVENESS. 
	Even if torture sex isn't the sin against the Holy Ghost, it is vile beyond
belief and the nastiest of sins. You may have been forced into it. You may
have been brainwashed into thinking that it was nothing much. Even if you
don't bear full responsibility for the vileness, though, it is likely that
you will feel the need for forgiveness. The association between MY sexual
pleasure and SOMEONE ELSE'S agony is too sick (too, too, sick) to avoid all
personal consequences. It is natural to feel irretrievably dirty after such
hideous and hateful unnaturalness, no matter what the pseudo-justifications
offered by the tutor-cunts. Sometimes the heart knows what the head denies. 
	In a technical spiritual sense, simply asking for forgiveness may be what
actually achieves it. However, practically, forgiveness is not achieved,
either spiritually or psychologically, by FAITH alone, but also by WORKS.
"Wow, I am forgiven!" is not good enough by itself, soon running out of
currency unless acted upon. As people are, so shall they act. Faith without
works is fruitless, just as works without faith are empty. You need to DO
something. 
	Work, fight, in every way open to you against what the Universe hates.
(Because of brainwashing, there are probably more ways open to you than you
realise.) Doing "nice" things, by joining Rotary for instance, is not the
way to go, except as a "cover" or as a temporary relief from spiritual
directness. (Actions which of themselves might be laudable can, in the face
of such treason, be reprehensible. Too, too, comfortable for words.) Direct
action against the source of the rottenness itself is required, even if that
might have to be covert much of the time. Don't put bandaids on the cancer -
there are lots of people prepared to do that. Do everything within your
power to kill the cancer.
	Does that mean that you have to show as much courage as the hitman in order
to be forgiven? No, it doesn't. An appropriate analogy is that of
canonisation - the making of a saint - within the Catholic Church.
Canonisation means that the Church is CERTAIN that a particular person is in
heaven. Lots of other people also make it, though, even if the Church on
earth isn't certain of it. Similarly, great courage may create a certainty
of reward, but lesser courage may be just as effective in reaching the
desired goal. 
	Do what you can, what you REALLY can. That means taking reasonable chances.
It may seem that all the power, overwhelming power, is on the other side,
but that power has limits. You have the Universe on your side, and
ultimately it's the truth that counts as the source of power. Using your
brains, you can subvert the rotten system and start achieving forgiveness.
	At the least, talk about how forgiveness is possible and can be earned to
your friends who are in a similar quandary. There is no need to be one of
those who apparently believe that nothing can be done, so one should enjoy
it as much as possible, even if always terrified of death. Nor is there a
need to be one of the more despicable, but piteous, hypocrites who
apparently believe that there isn't even a problem, even if always terrified
of death. Give your friends the chance to get off the merry-go-round of
self-hatred, often masked and often clothed in "religion". Then, they might
knowingly exercise the option to become real Christians, real Muslims, real
Satanists or real anything-elses. They will love you as much as they are
relieved, even if new responsibilities are introduced. 
 
6.  CAN INNOCENCE BE REGAINED? 
	Unfortunately, no: innocence once lost can't be regained. It's a one-way
process. It is possible, however, to (re)learn its near relative
"naturalness", our dignity as natural animals (who could never be into
torture sex). It is possible to free oneself to some extent from the false
ways of an unnatural society.
	Going along with "naturalness" can be a unique and inestimable sort of
"certainty-happiness". All that is required is that you respond without
self-deception to the greatest nastiness in your life (and that it
inevitably is, if rarely considered let alone acknowledged). That
"certainty-happiness" will give you great strength and comfort, even if you
can't possibly avoid having to give way to duress again. Bide your time,
plot and plan your response, a response suited to your talents. If it is
your way to serve, kill the main perpetrators. None of them is your friend.
None of them is a "nice person". None of them is worthy of deference. All
are the vilest of continuing, voluntary, murderers, traitors and criminals
against humanity. The law as it is supposed to be would freely sanction such
justifiable homicide. The Universe would love you. Just make sure that, to
avoid retribution, you die in the act. 
 
7.  THE AUTHOR'S STARTING AND FINISHING POINTS 
	Why am I interested in the sin against the Holy Ghost? Because the two
people I've most loved - Phil, the hitman, and, because of him, Robbie -
were both "caught" in torture sex, although I didn't know that from the
beginning. Somehow, they were strong enough to understand that if another,
natural, "animal" could really love them, then real love and forgiveness in
the Universe were possible. They understood intuitively, if unusually, that
the standard definition of the sin against the Holy Ghost was just wrong.
The hardest thing is to forgive oneself. I wanted to help in that process in
their honour.
	As this is being transmitted, I am in the process of "shuffling off this
mortal coil", of joining "les justes". I was in danger already, and the
publication of this would, if I were not to act first, seal my earthly fate
with certainty. The martyrs would not demand pointless suffering. A
protracted, agonising, death is neither mandatory nor inevitable. What
matters is that one's death should count. (Are you listening, suicide
bombers?) Witness enough is here in my little bit for Phil and Robbie, for
you, against the greatest vileness in the history of the world. 
	I hope that my "parvum opus" provides some of you with the thought-data and
the courage to be even a tiny bit unwise in the face of that
oh-so-socially-acceptable treason. You know, if most people of quality in
the world were prepared to take a chance of 1 in 10, or even 1 in 100, their
actions, along with the actions of some prepared to waive their right to a
long life, would see history reversed. The human race could free itself
forever from the systematic, institutionalised, hypocrisy and foulness which
infect every level, and affect every aspect, of societies around the world. 
	How could you expect to live in tune with the Universe, and die with
equanimity, if you never did anything about such inhuman (and unsatanic)
rottenness? That point explains really why there are so few people in the
world who are genuinely, naturally, at-home with themselves, and why so many
claw to hang on to their miserable little lives. It's tough being a nasty
little bunny rabbit. 
	Don't just warm yourself by the fire. Throw on some wood, and watch the
cunts scatter. Translate, linguists! Republish freely, anonymously,
cyber(un)holy! May the sun be always in your face, and the wind always at
your back. ALLAHU AKBAR!

THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST


BECAUSE OF ITS VILENESS, TORTURE SEX IS THE GREATEST CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
IMAGINABLE.  BUT IT ISN'T THE UNFORGIVABLE SIN.  IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT
AFTERWARDS. 
 
 
SUMMARY:  (i) The Biblical evidence for torture sex being the sin against
the Holy Ghost is zilch. The sin is mentioned, but NOWHERE defined. (ii) The
association turns basically on an interpretation by some within the Catholic
Church, which has been enshrined in canon law. Canon law is fallible; it can
and does change. And this interpretation is misguided, as many clergy within
the Catholic Church would concede if presented with the following case.
(iii) Consider a hitman who takes such great chances for a potential
torture-sex victim that he ends up becoming a victim himself. Wouldn't God
love such enormous courage? Wouldn't He be more concerned with what was in
the heart than with what was on the history sheet? Hitmen can find
salvation, and so can you, without necessarily showing such extreme courage.
(iv) For once, BE somebody for the Universe, and not just a brainwashed,
scar(r)ed, nasty little bunny rabbit.

1.  WHAT IS THE AUTHORITY FOR THE "SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST"? 
	The sin against the Holy Ghost (the "unforgivable sin") is mentioned only
in passing in the three "synoptic" Gospels (Matthew 12:32, Mark 3:29 and
Luke 12:10). (Synoptic, "with the one view", because all three Gospels came
from basically the same sources.) It occupies only a verse in each case.
John doesn't write about it at all. In other words, in the prime authorities
of the New Testament, the Gospels, the discussion of the sin against the
Holy Ghost is hardly central. (Check it out for yourself: http://
www.gospelcom.net/ bible) 
	Is the sin against the Holy Ghost (called "blasphemy" in the King James
Version) defined? No, it is not. So HOW did torture sex come to be thought
of as the sin against the Holy Ghost? 
 
2.  IS TORTURE SEX THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	For the few mega-warped medieval "Christians" into torture sex, who felt
themselves to be beyond redemption, the association between the famous
passage of Paul about the body as the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1
Corinthians 6) and the sin against the Holy Ghost was obvious. Mightn't the
sin against the Holy Ghost possibly be...torture sex? 
	Later, some senior people in the Catholic Church, aware of the warped ones,
erroneously thought that it might be too. After all, it was the vilest of
sins. Their quite fallible misinterpretation persists, especially for those
on whom it was imprinted in a state of semi-hysterical gullibility. 
	Now, of course, even if an association between the sin against the Holy
Ghost and the body as the temple of the Holy Ghost might be plausible, that
does not suggest torture sex in the slightest. In fact, reading the rest of
the cited chapters, it might well be concluded with equal logic that, among
other things, being an active gay was the sin against the Holy Ghost. Other
passages of Scripture which might be cited as evidence are even more
distantly related.  
	The Biblical evidence that torture sex is the sin against the Holy Ghost is
anything but compelling. It all turns on the internal "canon law" of the
Catholic Church, which was purely reactive in this case. And Catholic canon
laws are like ordinary laws: they might be enforceable, with certain
"church" penalties, but equally they might be changed tomorrow. Canon law
can and does change. It is not an immutable summary of God's eternal truths. 
	The shallowness of the canon law interpretation in this instance is shown
by consideration of a simple, but true, example. An expert hitman came to
love a potential torture-sex victim as a friend. In attempting to protect
him, the hitman became, almost inevitably, a victim himself. He knew what he
had done in his life, he well knew what the likely penalties for defending
his friend were, but he went ahead anyway.  
	Who would dare suggest that God would reject such a one? Jesus said (of a
simple death): 
		"Greater love hath no man than this, 
		 that a man lay down his life for his friends"	(John 15:13) 
and also: 
		"Inasmuch as ye have done it [for] one of the least of these my
		 brethren, ye have done it [for] me"		(Matthew 25:40). 
The hitman's love and nearly unbelievable courage would have saved him,
baptised him in blood. Nothing he could have been made to do or say in his
last earthly moments could, because of its forced nature, conceivably have
lessened his beauty before God. Indeed, his last free words, facing a horror
beyond natural human description, were to request that no blood be
splattered upon his jumper ("sweater"). It had been given to him by the
friend and, although grubby from overuse on the run, symbolised their
friendship. More importantly, the story of his final courage started to get
around - as he knew it would - and helped protect his friend further. At a
time when most would turn to jelly, with thoughts only of what was to come,
he kept his cool enough to do the single most useful thing within his power
to save another. That shows where his soul was at. 
	So, even though the hitman had engaged in torture sex most of his life
(apparently willingly), he had not committed the unforgivable sin. Even if
that story were not true (and I hate that it is real, although I rejoice in
his heroism and eternal reward), it certainly COULD be. There are people in
this world with such enormous generosity of spirit, even amongst those who
would normally hide self-hatred behind plausible bravado. And, just as the
robber who hung on the cross beside Jesus, they will enjoy paradise (Luke
23:39-43). Only one negative case is needed to prove the point: torture sex
is not the sin against the Holy Ghost.

3.  SO WHAT IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	If Matthew, Mark and Luke didn't bother to define the sin against the Holy
Ghost, some plausible hypotheses for that are: 
	(a) it isn't important in general (hard to believe, since it denies
		salvation), 
	(b) it is so uncommon that it's hardly worth talking about (well,
		perhaps then...), 
	(c) they couldn't write an essay well enough to pass a first year
		Medicine exam (even with Dads who were Doctors), and 
	(d) the readers/listeners for whom they were writing would have
		known straight away what they were talking about. 
The last alternative seems the most likely to me. Their readers/listeners
KNEW what "blasphemy" (the sin) against the Holy Ghost was. And, indeed,
tautological though it might be, it is pretty obvious. 
	Quite simply, the sin against the Holy Ghost is refusing to believe in the
love of God. The Holy Ghost is the spirit of God, the spirit of love, in the
Godhead. "Blasphemy" against the Holy Ghost is denying the possibility of
God's forgiveness. If you don't want it, you can't have it.  
	The readers/listeners for whom they were writing, in the Palestine of the
1st Century AD, would have been very familiar with the Holy Ghost ("the
comforter" in John) as the spirit of love. But would anyone seriously
suggest that there and at that time torture sex was common? Maybe a badly
beaten camel, or a bit of shit-maker in the well, perhaps even the odd
"Murder of the Innocents", but widespread torture sex? Do me a favour! 
	The reality of the sin against the Holy Ghost, however, is not just the
simple denial of God's love once. By its very nature, hopelessness feeds
upon itself. Feeling divorced forever from Universal forgiveness leads
inexorably to an inward spiral of self-hatred and the perpetuation of
self-hating action. Eternal hope is cut off more and more. Unbroken, the
process will complete itself. 
	Where Catholic canon law gets close to the mark is that torture sex is the
most psychologically detrimental sin imaginable (barring the S. against the
H.G.). Accordingly, torture sex is likely to lead to the (real) sin against
the Holy Ghost more than anything else. But do you see the distinction?
Torture sex ISN'T the sin against the Holy Ghost itself, it's just the most
likely to give rise to the feelings that become the sin against the Holy
Ghost. It can be forgiven, but not if hopelessness takes over to the point
where the vision is clouded forever.  
 
4.  WOULD THE LORD OF CHAOS BE INTERESTED? 
	Does Homer like donuts? What kind of Satan would want souls foist upon him?
Surely the real Lord of Chaos would want people to choose him freely:
raunchy chaos over pusillanimous order, that sort of thing. But on the
rebound? Even Satan wants you to get it right about the sin against the Holy
Ghost. Choose the Lord of Chaos, by all means, but CHOOSE. And choice
requires freedom. Know that you haven't committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost...yet. 
	However, if you think about it, the Lord of Chaos would hate torture sex as
much as God does. Since when is rotten, vile, ghastly, fucked-up,
hypocritical and unnatural ORDER equivalent to the pure chaos of "evil"? Is
Satan a hypocrite? Would he want such vile, hypocritical, followers? Such a
fucked-up response to fucked-up medieval Christianity couldn't possibly
describe the Lord of the Universe that I would want to serve. It would be as
false to suggest that that was Satanism as it would be to put forward that
the sale of indulgences was Christianity. Further, if Satan were to have a
motto, it would surely be "give the cunts hell". Guess who the cunts are?
Instead of being rewarded, those who continue to advocate such patently
false Satanism will, if there are levels to hell, go straight to the bottom
for eternity. They are traitors to God and Satan alike.
 
5.  ACHIEVING FORGIVENESS. 
	Even if torture sex isn't the sin against the Holy Ghost, it is vile beyond
belief and the nastiest of sins. You may have been forced into it. You may
have been brainwashed into thinking that it was nothing much. Even if you
don't bear full responsibility for the vileness, though, it is likely that
you will feel the need for forgiveness. The association between MY sexual
pleasure and SOMEONE ELSE'S agony is too sick (too, too, sick) to avoid all
personal consequences. It is natural to feel irretrievably dirty after such
hideous and hateful unnaturalness, no matter what the pseudo-justifications
offered by the tutor-cunts. Sometimes the heart knows what the head denies. 
	In a technical spiritual sense, simply asking for forgiveness may be what
actually achieves it. However, practically, forgiveness is not achieved,
either spiritually or psychologically, by FAITH alone, but also by WORKS.
"Wow, I am forgiven!" is not good enough by itself, soon running out of
currency unless acted upon. As people are, so shall they act. Faith without
works is fruitless, just as works without faith are empty. You need to DO
something. 
	Work, fight, in every way open to you against what the Universe hates.
(Because of brainwashing, there are probably more ways open to you than you
realise.) Doing "nice" things, by joining Rotary for instance, is not the
way to go, except as a "cover" or as a temporary relief from spiritual
directness. (Actions which of themselves might be laudable can, in the face
of such treason, be reprehensible. Too, too, comfortable for words.) Direct
action against the source of the rottenness itself is required, even if that
might have to be covert much of the time. Don't put bandaids on the cancer -
there are lots of people prepared to do that. Do everything within your
power to kill the cancer.
	Does that mean that you have to show as much courage as the hitman in order
to be forgiven? No, it doesn't. An appropriate analogy is that of
canonisation - the making of a saint - within the Catholic Church.
Canonisation means that the Church is CERTAIN that a particular person is in
heaven. Lots of other people also make it, though, even if the Church on
earth isn't certain of it. Similarly, great courage may create a certainty
of reward, but lesser courage may be just as effective in reaching the
desired goal. 
	Do what you can, what you REALLY can. That means taking reasonable chances.
It may seem that all the power, overwhelming power, is on the other side,
but that power has limits. You have the Universe on your side, and
ultimately it's the truth that counts as the source of power. Using your
brains, you can subvert the rotten system and start achieving forgiveness.
	At the least, talk about how forgiveness is possible and can be earned to
your friends who are in a similar quandary. There is no need to be one of
those who apparently believe that nothing can be done, so one should enjoy
it as much as possible, even if always terrified of death. Nor is there a
need to be one of the more despicable, but piteous, hypocrites who
apparently believe that there isn't even a problem, even if always terrified
of death. Give your friends the chance to get off the merry-go-round of
self-hatred, often masked and often clothed in "religion". Then, they might
knowingly exercise the option to become real Christians, real Muslims, real
Satanists or real anything-elses. They will love you as much as they are
relieved, even if new responsibilities are introduced. 
 
6.  CAN INNOCENCE BE REGAINED? 
	Unfortunately, no: innocence once lost can't be regained. It's a one-way
process. It is possible, however, to (re)learn its near relative
"naturalness", our dignity as natural animals (who could never be into
torture sex). It is possible to free oneself to some extent from the false
ways of an unnatural society.
	Going along with "naturalness" can be a unique and inestimable sort of
"certainty-happiness". All that is required is that you respond without
self-deception to the greatest nastiness in your life (and that it
inevitably is, if rarely considered let alone acknowledged). That
"certainty-happiness" will give you great strength and comfort, even if you
can't possibly avoid having to give way to duress again. Bide your time,
plot and plan your response, a response suited to your talents. If it is
your way to serve, kill the main perpetrators. None of them is your friend.
None of them is a "nice person". None of them is worthy of deference. All
are the vilest of continuing, voluntary, murderers, traitors and criminals
against humanity. The law as it is supposed to be would freely sanction such
justifiable homicide. The Universe would love you. Just make sure that, to
avoid retribution, you die in the act. 
 
7.  THE AUTHOR'S STARTING AND FINISHING POINTS 
	Why am I interested in the sin against the Holy Ghost? Because the two
people I've most loved - Phil, the hitman, and, because of him, Robbie -
were both "caught" in torture sex, although I didn't know that from the
beginning. Somehow, they were strong enough to understand that if another,
natural, "animal" could really love them, then real love and forgiveness in
the Universe were possible. They understood intuitively, if unusually, that
the standard definition of the sin against the Holy Ghost was just wrong.
The hardest thing is to forgive oneself. I wanted to help in that process in
their honour.
	As this is being transmitted, I am in the process of "shuffling off this
mortal coil", of joining "les justes". I was in danger already, and the
publication of this would, if I were not to act first, seal my earthly fate
with certainty. The martyrs would not demand pointless suffering. A
protracted, agonising, death is neither mandatory nor inevitable. What
matters is that one's death should count. (Are you listening, suicide
bombers?) Witness enough is here in my little bit for Phil and Robbie, for
you, against the greatest vileness in the history of the world. 
	I hope that my "parvum opus" provides some of you with the thought-data and
the courage to be even a tiny bit unwise in the face of that
oh-so-socially-acceptable treason. You know, if most people of quality in
the world were prepared to take a chance of 1 in 10, or even 1 in 100, their
actions, along with the actions of some prepared to waive their right to a
long life, would see history reversed. The human race could free itself
forever from the systematic, institutionalised, hypocrisy and foulness which
infect every level, and affect every aspect, of societies around the world. 
	How could you expect to live in tune with the Universe, and die with
equanimity, if you never did anything about such inhuman (and unsatanic)
rottenness? That point explains really why there are so few people in the
world who are genuinely, naturally, at-home with themselves, and why so many
claw to hang on to their miserable little lives. It's tough being a nasty
little bunny rabbit. 
	Don't just warm yourself by the fire. Throw on some wood, and watch the
cunts scatter. Translate, linguists! Republish freely, anonymously,
cyber(un)holy! May the sun be always in your face, and the wind always at
your back. ALLAHU AKBAR!

THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST


BECAUSE OF ITS VILENESS, TORTURE SEX IS THE GREATEST CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
IMAGINABLE.  BUT IT ISN'T THE UNFORGIVABLE SIN.  IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT
AFTERWARDS. 
 
 
SUMMARY:  (i) The Biblical evidence for torture sex being the sin against
the Holy Ghost is zilch. The sin is mentioned, but NOWHERE defined. (ii) The
association turns basically on an interpretation by some within the Catholic
Church, which has been enshrined in canon law. Canon law is fallible; it can
and does change. And this interpretation is misguided, as many clergy within
the Catholic Church would concede if presented with the following case.
(iii) Consider a hitman who takes such great chances for a potential
torture-sex victim that he ends up becoming a victim himself. Wouldn't God
love such enormous courage? Wouldn't He be more concerned with what was in
the heart than with what was on the history sheet? Hitmen can find
salvation, and so can you, without necessarily showing such extreme courage.
(iv) For once, BE somebody for the Universe, and not just a brainwashed,
scar(r)ed, nasty little bunny rabbit.

7.  THE AUTHOR'S STARTING AND FINISHING POINTS. 
 
1.  WHAT IS THE AUTHORITY FOR THE "SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST"? 
	The sin against the Holy Ghost (the "unforgivable sin") is mentioned only
in passing in the three "synoptic" Gospels (Matthew 12:32, Mark 3:29 and
Luke 12:10). (Synoptic, "with the one view", because all three Gospels came
from basically the same sources.) It occupies only a verse in each case.
John doesn't write about it at all. In other words, in the prime authorities
of the New Testament, the Gospels, the discussion of the sin against the
Holy Ghost is hardly central. (Check it out for yourself: http://
www.gospelcom.net/ bible) 
	Is the sin against the Holy Ghost (called "blasphemy" in the King James
Version) defined? No, it is not. So HOW did torture sex come to be thought
of as the sin against the Holy Ghost? 
 
2.  IS TORTURE SEX THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	For the few mega-warped medieval "Christians" into torture sex, who felt
themselves to be beyond redemption, the association between the famous
passage of Paul about the body as the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1
Corinthians 6) and the sin against the Holy Ghost was obvious. Mightn't the
sin against the Holy Ghost possibly be...torture sex? 
	Later, some senior people in the Catholic Church, aware of the warped ones,
erroneously thought that it might be too. After all, it was the vilest of
sins. Their quite fallible misinterpretation persists, especially for those
on whom it was imprinted in a state of semi-hysterical gullibility. 
	Now, of course, even if an association between the sin against the Holy
Ghost and the body as the temple of the Holy Ghost might be plausible, that
does not suggest torture sex in the slightest. In fact, reading the rest of
the cited chapters, it might well be concluded with equal logic that, among
other things, being an active gay was the sin against the Holy Ghost. Other
passages of Scripture which might be cited as evidence are even more
distantly related.  
	The Biblical evidence that torture sex is the sin against the Holy Ghost is
anything but compelling. It all turns on the internal "canon law" of the
Catholic Church, which was purely reactive in this case. And Catholic canon
laws are like ordinary laws: they might be enforceable, with certain
"church" penalties, but equally they might be changed tomorrow. Canon law
can and does change. It is not an immutable summary of God's eternal truths. 
	The shallowness of the canon law interpretation in this instance is shown
by consideration of a simple, but true, example. An expert hitman came to
love a potential torture-sex victim as a friend. In attempting to protect
him, the hitman became, almost inevitably, a victim himself. He knew what he
had done in his life, he well knew what the likely penalties for defending
his friend were, but he went ahead anyway.  
	Who would dare suggest that God would reject such a one? Jesus said (of a
simple death): 
		"Greater love hath no man than this, 
		 that a man lay down his life for his friends"	(John 15:13) 
and also: 
		"Inasmuch as ye have done it [for] one of the least of these my
		 brethren, ye have done it [for] me"		(Matthew 25:40). 
The hitman's love and nearly unbelievable courage would have saved him,
baptised him in blood. Nothing he could have been made to do or say in his
last earthly moments could, because of its forced nature, conceivably have
lessened his beauty before God. Indeed, his last free words, facing a horror
beyond natural human description, were to request that no blood be
splattered upon his jumper ("sweater"). It had been given to him by the
friend and, although grubby from overuse on the run, symbolised their
friendship. More importantly, the story of his final courage started to get
around - as he knew it would - and helped protect his friend further. At a
time when most would turn to jelly, with thoughts only of what was to come,
he kept his cool enough to do the single most useful thing within his power
to save another. That shows where his soul was at. 
	So, even though the hitman had engaged in torture sex most of his life
(apparently willingly), he had not committed the unforgivable sin. Even if
that story were not true (and I hate that it is real, although I rejoice in
his heroism and eternal reward), it certainly COULD be. There are people in
this world with such enormous generosity of spirit, even amongst those who
would normally hide self-hatred behind plausible bravado. And, just as the
robber who hung on the cross beside Jesus, they will enjoy paradise (Luke
23:39-43). Only one negative case is needed to prove the point: torture sex
is not the sin against the Holy Ghost.

3.  SO WHAT IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	If Matthew, Mark and Luke didn't bother to define the sin against the Holy
Ghost, some plausible hypotheses for that are: 
	(a) it isn't important in general (hard to believe, since it denies
		salvation), 
	(b) it is so uncommon that it's hardly worth talking about (well,
		perhaps then...), 
	(c) they couldn't write an essay well enough to pass a first year
		Medicine exam (even with Dads who were Doctors), and 
	(d) the readers/listeners for whom they were writing would have
		known straight away what they were talking about. 
The last alternative seems the most likely to me. Their readers/listeners
KNEW what "blasphemy" (the sin) against the Holy Ghost was. And, indeed,
tautological though it might be, it is pretty obvious. 
	Quite simply, the sin against the Holy Ghost is refusing to believe in the
love of God. The Holy Ghost is the spirit of God, the spirit of love, in the
Godhead. "Blasphemy" against the Holy Ghost is denying the possibility of
God's forgiveness. If you don't want it, you can't have it.  
	The readers/listeners for whom they were writing, in the Palestine of the
1st Century AD, would have been very familiar with the Holy Ghost ("the
comforter" in John) as the spirit of love. But would anyone seriously
suggest that there and at that time torture sex was common? Maybe a badly
beaten camel, or a bit of shit-maker in the well, perhaps even the odd
"Murder of the Innocents", but widespread torture sex? Do me a favour! 
	The reality of the sin against the Holy Ghost, however, is not just the
simple denial of God's love once. By its very nature, hopelessness feeds
upon itself. Feeling divorced forever from Universal forgiveness leads
inexorably to an inward spiral of self-hatred and the perpetuation of
self-hating action. Eternal hope is cut off more and more. Unbroken, the
process will complete itself. 
	Where Catholic canon law gets close to the mark is that torture sex is the
most psychologically detrimental sin imaginable (barring the S. against the
H.G.). Accordingly, torture sex is likely to lead to the (real) sin against
the Holy Ghost more than anything else. But do you see the distinction?
Torture sex ISN'T the sin against the Holy Ghost itself, it's just the most
likely to give rise to the feelings that become the sin against the Holy
Ghost. It can be forgiven, but not if hopelessness takes over to the point
where the vision is clouded forever.  
 
4.  WOULD THE LORD OF CHAOS BE INTERESTED? 
	Does Homer like donuts? What kind of Satan would want souls foist upon him?
Surely the real Lord of Chaos would want people to choose him freely:
raunchy chaos over pusillanimous order, that sort of thing. But on the
rebound? Even Satan wants you to get it right about the sin against the Holy
Ghost. Choose the Lord of Chaos, by all means, but CHOOSE. And choice
requires freedom. Know that you haven't committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost...yet. 
	However, if you think about it, the Lord of Chaos would hate torture sex as
much as God does. Since when is rotten, vile, ghastly, fucked-up,
hypocritical and unnatural ORDER equivalent to the pure chaos of "evil"? Is
Satan a hypocrite? Would he want such vile, hypocritical, followers? Such a
fucked-up response to fucked-up medieval Christianity couldn't possibly
describe the Lord of the Universe that I would want to serve. It would be as
false to suggest that that was Satanism as it would be to put forward that
the sale of indulgences was Christianity. Further, if Satan were to have a
motto, it would surely be "give the cunts hell". Guess who the cunts are?
Instead of being rewarded, those who continue to advocate such patently
false Satanism will, if there are levels to hell, go straight to the bottom
for eternity. They are traitors to God and Satan alike.
 
5.  ACHIEVING FORGIVENESS. 
	Even if torture sex isn't the sin against the Holy Ghost, it is vile beyond
belief and the nastiest of sins. You may have been forced into it. You may
have been brainwashed into thinking that it was nothing much. Even if you
don't bear full responsibility for the vileness, though, it is likely that
you will feel the need for forgiveness. The association between MY sexual
pleasure and SOMEONE ELSE'S agony is too sick (too, too, sick) to avoid all
personal consequences. It is natural to feel irretrievably dirty after such
hideous and hateful unnaturalness, no matter what the pseudo-justifications
offered by the tutor-cunts. Sometimes the heart knows what the head denies. 
	In a technical spiritual sense, simply asking for forgiveness may be what
actually achieves it. However, practically, forgiveness is not achieved,
either spiritually or psychologically, by FAITH alone, but also by WORKS.
"Wow, I am forgiven!" is not good enough by itself, soon running out of
currency unless acted upon. As people are, so shall they act. Faith without
works is fruitless, just as works without faith are empty. You need to DO
something. 
	Work, fight, in every way open to you against what the Universe hates.
(Because of brainwashing, there are probably more ways open to you than you
realise.) Doing "nice" things, by joining Rotary for instance, is not the
way to go, except as a "cover" or as a temporary relief from spiritual
directness. (Actions which of themselves might be laudable can, in the face
of such treason, be reprehensible. Too, too, comfortable for words.) Direct
action against the source of the rottenness itself is required, even if that
might have to be covert much of the time. Don't put bandaids on the cancer -
there are lots of people prepared to do that. Do everything within your
power to kill the cancer.
	Does that mean that you have to show as much courage as the hitman in order
to be forgiven? No, it doesn't. An appropriate analogy is that of
canonisation - the making of a saint - within the Catholic Church.
Canonisation means that the Church is CERTAIN that a particular person is in
heaven. Lots of other people also make it, though, even if the Church on
earth isn't certain of it. Similarly, great courage may create a certainty
of reward, but lesser courage may be just as effective in reaching the
desired goal. 
	Do what you can, what you REALLY can. That means taking reasonable chances.
It may seem that all the power, overwhelming power, is on the other side,
but that power has limits. You have the Universe on your side, and
ultimately it's the truth that counts as the source of power. Using your
brains, you can subvert the rotten system and start achieving forgiveness.
	At the least, talk about how forgiveness is possible and can be earned to
your friends who are in a similar quandary. There is no need to be one of
those who apparently believe that nothing can be done, so one should enjoy
it as much as possible, even if always terrified of death. Nor is there a
need to be one of the more despicable, but piteous, hypocrites who
apparently believe that there isn't even a problem, even if always terrified
of death. Give your friends the chance to get off the merry-go-round of
self-hatred, often masked and often clothed in "religion". Then, they might
knowingly exercise the option to become real Christians, real Muslims, real
Satanists or real anything-elses. They will love you as much as they are
relieved, even if new responsibilities are introduced. 
 
6.  CAN INNOCENCE BE REGAINED? 
	Unfortunately, no: innocence once lost can't be regained. It's a one-way
process. It is possible, however, to (re)learn its near relative
"naturalness", our dignity as natural animals (who could never be into
torture sex). It is possible to free oneself to some extent from the false
ways of an unnatural society.
	Going along with "naturalness" can be a unique and inestimable sort of
"certainty-happiness". All that is required is that you respond without
self-deception to the greatest nastiness in your life (and that it
inevitably is, if rarely considered let alone acknowledged). That
"certainty-happiness" will give you great strength and comfort, even if you
can't possibly avoid having to give way to duress again. Bide your time,
plot and plan your response, a response suited to your talents. If it is
your way to serve, kill the main perpetrators. None of them is your friend.
None of them is a "nice person". None of them is worthy of deference. All
are the vilest of continuing, voluntary, murderers, traitors and criminals
against humanity. The law as it is supposed to be would freely sanction such
justifiable homicide. The Universe would love you. Just make sure that, to
avoid retribution, you die in the act. 
 
7.  THE AUTHOR'S STARTING AND FINISHING POINTS 
	Why am I interested in the sin against the Holy Ghost? Because the two
people I've most loved - Phil, the hitman, and, because of him, Robbie -
were both "caught" in torture sex, although I didn't know that from the
beginning. Somehow, they were strong enough to understand that if another,
natural, "animal" could really love them, then real love and forgiveness in
the Universe were possible. They understood intuitively, if unusually, that
the standard definition of the sin against the Holy Ghost was just wrong.
The hardest thing is to forgive oneself. I wanted to help in that process in
their honour.
	As this is being transmitted, I am in the process of "shuffling off this
mortal coil", of joining "les justes". I was in danger already, and the
publication of this would, if I were not to act first, seal my earthly fate
with certainty. The martyrs would not demand pointless suffering. A
protracted, agonising, death is neither mandatory nor inevitable. What
matters is that one's death should count. (Are you listening, suicide
bombers?) Witness enough is here in my little bit for Phil and Robbie, for
you, against the greatest vileness in the history of the world. 
	I hope that my "parvum opus" provides some of you with the thought-data and
the courage to be even a tiny bit unwise in the face of that
oh-so-socially-acceptable treason. You know, if most people of quality in
the world were prepared to take a chance of 1 in 10, or even 1 in 100, their
actions, along with the actions of some prepared to waive their right to a
long life, would see history reversed. The human race could free itself
forever from the systematic, institutionalised, hypocrisy and foulness which
infect every level, and affect every aspect, of societies around the world. 
	How could you expect to live in tune with the Universe, and die with
equanimity, if you never did anything about such inhuman (and unsatanic)
rottenness? That point explains really why there are so few people in the
world who are genuinely, naturally, at-home with themselves, and why so many
claw to hang on to their miserable little lives. It's tough being a nasty
little bunny rabbit. 
	Don't just warm yourself by the fire. Throw on some wood, and watch the
cunts scatter. Translate, linguists! Republish freely, anonymously,
cyber(un)holy! May the sun be always in your face, and the wind always at
your back. ALLAHU AKBAR!

THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST


BECAUSE OF ITS VILENESS, TORTURE SEX IS THE GREATEST CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
IMAGINABLE.  BUT IT ISN'T THE UNFORGIVABLE SIN.  IT JUST FEELS LIKE IT
AFTERWARDS. 
 
 
SUMMARY:  (i) The Biblical evidence for torture sex being the sin against
the Holy Ghost is zilch. The sin is mentioned, but NOWHERE defined. (ii) The
association turns basically on an interpretation by some within the Catholic
Church, which has been enshrined in canon law. Canon law is fallible; it can
and does change. And this interpretation is misguided, as many clergy within
the Catholic Church would concede if presented with the following case.
(iii) Consider a hitman who takes such great chances for a potential
torture-sex victim that he ends up becoming a victim himself. Wouldn't God
love such enormous courage? Wouldn't He be more concerned with what was in
the heart than with what was on the history sheet? Hitmen can find
salvation, and so can you, without necessarily showing such extreme courage.
(iv) For once, BE somebody for the Universe, and not just a brainwashed,
scar(r)ed, nasty little bunny rabbit.

7.  THE AUTHOR'S STARTING AND FINISHING POINTS. 
 
1.  WHAT IS THE AUTHORITY FOR THE "SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST"? 
	The sin against the Holy Ghost (the "unforgivable sin") is mentioned only
in passing in the three "synoptic" Gospels (Matthew 12:32, Mark 3:29 and
Luke 12:10). (Synoptic, "with the one view", because all three Gospels came
from basically the same sources.) It occupies only a verse in each case.
John doesn't write about it at all. In other words, in the prime authorities
of the New Testament, the Gospels, the discussion of the sin against the
Holy Ghost is hardly central. (Check it out for yourself: http://
www.gospelcom.net/ bible) 
	Is the sin against the Holy Ghost (called "blasphemy" in the King James
Version) defined? No, it is not. So HOW did torture sex come to be thought
of as the sin against the Holy Ghost? 
 
2.  IS TORTURE SEX THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	For the few mega-warped medieval "Christians" into torture sex, who felt
themselves to be beyond redemption, the association between the famous
passage of Paul about the body as the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1
Corinthians 6) and the sin against the Holy Ghost was obvious. Mightn't the
sin against the Holy Ghost possibly be...torture sex? 
	Later, some senior people in the Catholic Church, aware of the warped ones,
erroneously thought that it might be too. After all, it was the vilest of
sins. Their quite fallible misinterpretation persists, especially for those
on whom it was imprinted in a state of semi-hysterical gullibility. 
	Now, of course, even if an association between the sin against the Holy
Ghost and the body as the temple of the Holy Ghost might be plausible, that
does not suggest torture sex in the slightest. In fact, reading the rest of
the cited chapters, it might well be concluded with equal logic that, among
other things, being an active gay was the sin against the Holy Ghost. Other
passages of Scripture which might be cited as evidence are even more
distantly related.  
	The Biblical evidence that torture sex is the sin against the Holy Ghost is
anything but compelling. It all turns on the internal "canon law" of the
Catholic Church, which was purely reactive in this case. And Catholic canon
laws are like ordinary laws: they might be enforceable, with certain
"church" penalties, but equally they might be changed tomorrow. Canon law
can and does change. It is not an immutable summary of God's eternal truths. 
	The shallowness of the canon law interpretation in this instance is shown
by consideration of a simple, but true, example. An expert hitman came to
love a potential torture-sex victim as a friend. In attempting to protect
him, the hitman became, almost inevitably, a victim himself. He knew what he
had done in his life, he well knew what the likely penalties for defending
his friend were, but he went ahead anyway.  
	Who would dare suggest that God would reject such a one? Jesus said (of a
simple death): 
		"Greater love hath no man than this, 
		 that a man lay down his life for his friends"	(John 15:13) 
and also: 
		"Inasmuch as ye have done it [for] one of the least of these my
		 brethren, ye have done it [for] me"		(Matthew 25:40). 
The hitman's love and nearly unbelievable courage would have saved him,
baptised him in blood. Nothing he could have been made to do or say in his
last earthly moments could, because of its forced nature, conceivably have
lessened his beauty before God. Indeed, his last free words, facing a horror
beyond natural human description, were to request that no blood be
splattered upon his jumper ("sweater"). It had been given to him by the
friend and, although grubby from overuse on the run, symbolised their
friendship. More importantly, the story of his final courage started to get
around - as he knew it would - and helped protect his friend further. At a
time when most would turn to jelly, with thoughts only of what was to come,
he kept his cool enough to do the single most useful thing within his power
to save another. That shows where his soul was at. 
	So, even though the hitman had engaged in torture sex most of his life
(apparently willingly), he had not committed the unforgivable sin. Even if
that story were not true (and I hate that it is real, although I rejoice in
his heroism and eternal reward), it certainly COULD be. There are people in
this world with such enormous generosity of spirit, even amongst those who
would normally hide self-hatred behind plausible bravado. And, just as the
robber who hung on the cross beside Jesus, they will enjoy paradise (Luke
23:39-43). Only one negative case is needed to prove the point: torture sex
is not the sin against the Holy Ghost.

3.  SO WHAT IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST? 
	If Matthew, Mark and Luke didn't bother to define the sin against the Holy
Ghost, some plausible hypotheses for that are: 
	(a) it isn't important in general (hard to believe, since it denies
		salvation), 
	(b) it is so uncommon that it's hardly worth talking about (well,
		perhaps then...), 
	(c) they couldn't write an essay well enough to pass a first year
		Medicine exam (even with Dads who were Doctors), and 
	(d) the readers/listeners for whom they were writing would have
		known straight away what they were talking about. 
The last alternative seems the most likely to me. Their readers/listeners
KNEW what "blasphemy" (the sin) against the Holy Ghost was. And, indeed,
tautological though it might be, it is pretty obvious. 
	Quite simply, the sin against the Holy Ghost is refusing to believe in the
love of God. The Holy Ghost is the spirit of God, the spirit of love, in the
Godhead. "Blasphemy" against the Holy Ghost is denying the possibility of
God's forgiveness. If you don't want it, you can't have it.  
	The readers/listeners for whom they were writing, in the Palestine of the
1st Century AD, would have been very familiar with the Holy Ghost ("the
comforter" in John) as the spirit of love. But would anyone seriously
suggest that there and at that time torture sex was common? Maybe a badly
beaten camel, or a bit of shit-maker in the well, perhaps even the odd
"Murder of the Innocents", but widespread torture sex? Do me a favour! 
	The reality of the sin against the Holy Ghost, however, is not just the
simple denial of God's love once. By its very nature, hopelessness feeds
upon itself. Feeling divorced forever from Universal forgiveness leads
inexorably to an inward spiral of self-hatred and the perpetuation of
self-hating action. Eternal hope is cut off more and more. Unbroken, the
process will complete itself. 
	Where Catholic canon law gets close to the mark is that torture sex is the
most psychologically detrimental sin imaginable (barring the S. against the
H.G.). Accordingly, torture sex is likely to lead to the (real) sin against
the Holy Ghost more than anything else. But do you see the distinction?
Torture sex ISN'T the sin against the Holy Ghost itself, it's just the most
likely to give rise to the feelings that become the sin against the Holy
Ghost. It can be forgiven, but not if hopelessness takes over to the point
where the vision is clouded forever.  
 
4.  WOULD THE LORD OF CHAOS BE INTERESTED? 
	Does Homer like donuts? What kind of Satan would want souls foist upon him?
Surely the real Lord of Chaos would want people to choose him freely:
raunchy chaos over pusillanimous order, that sort of thing. But on the
rebound? Even Satan wants you to get it right about the sin against the Holy
Ghost. Choose the Lord of Chaos, by all means, but CHOOSE. And choice
requires freedom. Know that you haven't committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost...yet. 
	However, if you think about it, the Lord of Chaos would hate torture sex as
much as God does. Since when is rotten, vile, ghastly, fucked-up,
hypocritical and unnatural ORDER equivalent to the pure chaos of "evil"? Is
Satan a hypocrite? Would he want such vile, hypocritical, followers? Such a
fucked-up response to fucked-up medieval Christianity couldn't possibly
describe the Lord of the Universe that I would want to serve. It would be as
false to suggest that that was Satanism as it would be to put forward that
the sale of indulgences was Christianity. Further, if Satan were to have a
motto, it would surely be "give the cunts hell". Guess who the cunts are?
Instead of being rewarded, those who continue to advocate such patently
false Satanism will, if there are levels to hell, go straight to the bottom
for eternity. They are traitors to God and Satan alike.
 
5.  ACHIEVING FORGIVENESS. 
	Even if torture sex isn't the sin against the Holy Ghost, it is vile beyond
belief and the nastiest of sins. You may have been forced into it. You may
have been brainwashed into thinking that it was nothing much. Even if you
don't bear full responsibility for the vileness, though, it is likely that
you will feel the need for forgiveness. The association between MY sexual
pleasure and SOMEONE ELSE'S agony is too sick (too, too, sick) to avoid all
personal consequences. It is natural to feel irretrievably dirty after such
hideous and hateful unnaturalness, no matter what the pseudo-justifications
offered by the tutor-cunts. Sometimes the heart knows what the head denies. 
	In a technical spiritual sense, simply asking for forgiveness may be what
actually achieves it. However, practically, forgiveness is not achieved,
either spiritually or psychologically, by FAITH alone, but also by WORKS.
"Wow, I am forgiven!" is not good enough by itself, soon running out of
currency unless acted upon. As people are, so shall they act. Faith without
works is fruitless, just as works without faith are empty. You need to DO
something. 
	Work, fight, in every way open to you against what the Universe hates.
(Because of brainwashing, there are probably more ways open to you than you
realise.) Doing "nice" things, by joining Rotary for instance, is not the
way to go, except as a "cover" or as a temporary relief from spiritual
directness. (Actions which of themselves might be laudable can, in the face
of such treason, be reprehensible. Too, too, comfortable for words.) Direct
action against the source of the rottenness itself is required, even if that
might have to be covert much of the time. Don't put bandaids on the cancer -
there are lots of people prepared to do that. Do everything within your
power to kill the cancer.
	Does that mean that you have to show as much courage as the hitman in order
to be forgiven? No, it doesn't. An appropriate analogy is that of
canonisation - the making of a saint - within the Catholic Church.
Canonisation means that the Church is CERTAIN that a particular person is in
heaven. Lots of other people also make it, though, even if the Church on
earth isn't certain of it. Similarly, great courage may create a certainty
of reward, but lesser courage may be just as effective in reaching the
desired goal. 
	Do what you can, what you REALLY can. That means taking reasonable chances.
It may seem that all the power, overwhelming power, is on the other side,
but that power has limits. You have the Universe on your side, and
ultimately it's the truth that counts as the source of power. Using your
brains, you can subvert the rotten system and start achieving forgiveness.
	At the least, talk about how forgiveness is possible and can be earned to
your friends who are in a similar quandary. There is no need to be one of
those who apparently believe that nothing can be done, so one should enjoy
it as much as possible, even if always terrified of death. Nor is there a
need to be one of the more despicable, but piteous, hypocrites who
apparently believe that there isn't even a problem, even if always terrified
of death. Give your friends the chance to get off the merry-go-round of
self-hatred, often masked and often clothed in "religion". Then, they might
knowingly exercise the option to become real Christians, real Muslims, real
Satanists or real anything-elses. They will love you as much as they are
relieved, even if new responsibilities are introduced. 
 
6.  CAN INNOCENCE BE REGAINED? 
	Unfortunately, no: innocence once lost can't be regained. It's a one-way
process. It is possible, however, to (re)learn its near relative
"naturalness", our dignity as natural animals (who could never be into
torture sex). It is possible to free oneself to some extent from the false
ways of an unnatural society.
	Going along with "naturalness" can be a unique and inestimable sort of
"certainty-happiness". All that is required is that you respond without
self-deception to the greatest nastiness in your life (and that it
inevitably is, if rarely considered let alone acknowledged). That
"certainty-happiness" will give you great strength and comfort, even if you
can't possibly avoid having to give way to duress again. Bide your time,
plot and plan your response, a response suited to your talents. If it is
your way to serve, kill the main perpetrators. None of them is your friend.
None of them is a "nice person". None of them is worthy of deference. All
are the vilest of continuing, voluntary, murderers, traitors and criminals
against humanity. The law as it is supposed to be would freely sanction such
justifiable homicide. The Universe would love you. Just make sure that, to
avoid retribution, you die in the act. 
 
7.  THE AUTHOR'S STARTING AND FINISHING POINTS 
	Why am I interested in the sin against the Holy Ghost? Because the two
people I've most loved - Phil, the hitman, and, because of him, Robbie -
were both "caught" in torture sex, although I didn't know that from the
beginning. Somehow, they were strong enough to understand that if another,
natural, "animal" could really love them, then real love and forgiveness in
the Universe were possible. They understood intuitively, if unusually, that
the standard definition of the sin against the Holy Ghost was just wrong.
The hardest thing is to forgive oneself. I wanted to help in that process in
their honour.
	As this is being transmitted, I am in the process of "shuffling off this
mortal coil", of joining "les justes". I was in danger already, and the
publication of this would, if I were not to act first, seal my earthly fate
with certainty. The martyrs would not demand pointless suffering. A
protracted, agonising, death is neither mandatory nor inevitable. What
matters is that one's death should count. (Are you listening, suicide
bombers?) Witness enough is here in my little bit for Phil and Robbie, for
you, against the greatest vileness in the history of the world. 
	I hope that my "parvum opus" provides some of you with the thought-data and
the courage to be even a tiny bit unwise in the face of that
oh-so-socially-acceptable treason. You know, if most people of quality in
the world were prepared to take a chance of 1 in 10, or even 1 in 100, their
actions, along with the actions of some prepared to waive their right to a
long life, would see history reversed. The human race could free itself
forever from the systematic, institutionalised, hypocrisy and foulness which
infect every level, and affect every aspect, of societies around the world. 
	How could you expect to live in tune with the Universe, and die with
equanimity, if you never did anything about such inhuman (and unsatanic)
rottenness? That point explains really why there are so few people in the
world who are genuinely, naturally, at-home with themselves, and why so many
claw to hang on to their miserable little lives. It's tough being a nasty
little bunny rabbit. 
	Don't just warm yourself by the fire. Throw on some wood, and watch the
cunts scatter. Translate, linguists! Republish freely, anonymously,
cyber(un)holy! May the sun be always in your face, and the wind always at
your back. ALLAHU AKBAR!

Our server group has recently switched to the new pine and we have trouble
printing all of the text of our messages.  Unless it is a very short
message, the middle or end of the text is missing.  We had been using pine
for years with no trouble until now.

Thank you, I'll get the new version of Pine, 3.93 has no "speller" option.

Yes. You can supply a value when you enter the "Reply-To" field in the
settings. Just add a colon and the text after it (in my case I have
"Reply-To: dat95pkn@idt.mdh.se" on some computers).

I don't believe that can be achieved.

I hope someone can help me.

I would like to know if there is a way to change the From: address in the
headers of a message prepared with Pine. I use a Linux machine at home,
and connect to the school network via SLIP. I've managed to have Pine
include a Reply-To: header with my correct email address, but I would
prefer the From: to read correctly.

I am currently running Linux 2.0.0, and using Pine 3.93 as my mail
program, and sendmail as the delivery agent. I am willing to upgrade to a
newer Pine, if it will make a difference.

One other concern is with the remote mailbox feature. I have a different
userid on my home machine than I do on the machine which handles my mail.
I use a remote mailbox within Pine to gather my mail from the machine at
school, yet the IMAP always defaults to my userid on the machine at home.
If there is a way I can change this, I'd like to know. This is nothing
more than a slight nuisance if anything.

Ultimately I'd like to be able to have two remote INBOX's, so I can gather
mail separately from two machines which both know me by different
userid's, and be able to configure Pine so that replies I send to messages
in either inbox appear to come from the appropriate account, rather than
from my home machine. This may be asking quite a bit, but then again, it's
possible to do from less sophisticated programs, (such Eudora Light for
windows, using separate configuration files -- I have no problems with
using different .pinerc files if that will solve my problems, but I can't
find any documentation anywhere that tells how to solve these problems),
so I figure it must be possible with Pine.

I have read all the documents I know of:
Getting_Started_On_Pine.txt
pine-FAQs.html
pine-faq-custom.html
pine-secrets.html
pine-setup.html

and the docs that went into /usr/doc/pine when I installed Pine:
brochure.txt
imap.vs.pop
mailcap.unx

If anybody can help me find the information I'm looking for, or knows of
how I can correct the From: address in messages I send, I'd really
appreciate the help.

Thank you for your time...

On the contrary, Pine 3.95 copes with NNTP servers wanting
username/password information just fine.  (Even those which want you to
authenticate before even allowing you to read news articles.)

Hi,

I'm looking for an exec of Pine for an Intergraph workstation running
Clix.  Do you have one or can you make one for me?  Unfortunately, I don't
have the equipment or the compiler otherwise I'd try to build it myself
from the source.  It's for a friend. 

Regards,
Cary

References are (afaik) only meant to be used in Usenet news. Pine supports
them there.

For using ispell with Pine versions prior to 3.92, a workaround by Michael
Ramey is described at URL:

Hello all:

	I have been using pine now for 2 weeks and simply love it!

I have noticed the following error:

[Mail not sent.  VERBOSE mode error: 502 Verbose unavailable.]

The sendmail.cf config line that causes this is:

	O PrivacyOptions=goaway,authwarnings

It also occurs if noexpn or novrfy is included in place of goaway.

I have the following in my pine config:
	[X]  enable-verbose-smtp-posting


So,  2 questions:

1)	Any ideas as to why this error is generated,  and if there is a fix
	available? 
	I do not want the ability for external 'vrfys' or 'expns',  but
	do want the verbose SMTP messages when I send mail.

2)	Can I have 'verbose' posting as the default when I do "<CTRL> X" and
	not have to do "<CTRL> X <CTRL> W" ?

-primus

One of our subscribers reports the ; option does not work to select
messages. She's right. I assumed some sort of option in pine.conf, but
after a perusal I can't find how to turn that option on. I'm obviously
doing something wrong. Anybody know what?

Gentlepersons,

Could you help me, please?  I really want to understand why my associates
who have "America on Line" cannot receive my E-mail messages.  I can send
messages to other universities, and those who have Erol's, but people who
have AOL, cannot receive my messages.

I can also be reached at (410) 328-2185.  Thank you for any help you can
give me.

Sincerely,


Carol Pfeffer
Administrative Assistant

We send dozens of messages to AOL daily with no problem. In fact, it's a
whole lot easier than Compuserve. It's just the person's e-mail address
@aol.com and away they go. If yours don't get there, you might peruse the
bounce message you would inevitably receive from your own server for clues
as to why there might be a problem.

Add an explicit port number (147 I think):

Um, you are supposed to blithely ignore the FAQ before _asking_ questions,
not before _answering_ them.

Yours hypocritically,

	This is an "easy" one to miss...

         FEATURE: enable-aggregate-command-set
 
Setting this feature enables the commands and subcommands that relate to
performing operations on more than one message at a time.  We call these
"aggregate operations".  In particular, the "; Select", "A Apply",
and "Z Zoom" commands are enabled by this feature.  Select is used to
"tag" one or more messages meeting the specified criteria.  Apply can
then be used to apply any message command to all of the selected/tagged
messages.  Further, the Zoom command allows you to toggle the Folder Index
view between just those Selected and all messages in the folder.
 
This feature also enables the "^X" subcommand in the FOLDER INDEX WhereIs
command which causes all messages matching the WhereIs argument to become
selected.

   The most
   
Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, Questions & Answers, and information on where to
   obtain the software, can be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer -- whichever organization provided you with the
   email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number of
   Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users.
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
     * If you are posting a question to the Pine Discussion Forum but do
       not subscribe to it, request in your message that replies be sent
       directly to you, with a copy to the forum. (Conversely, if you are
       answering a question in the Pine Discussion Forum, be sure to
       include the inquirer's email address in your reply, since s/he may
       not be a subscriber and will otherwise not see your answer).
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders

  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.

  Why does my message index show From: instead of To:?
  
   Applies to Pine for Unix only
   
   A number of Pine 3.95 users have reported seeing their own name,
   rather than the name of the recipient, in folder index listings of
   messages they have sent. This occurs when Pine detects the specific
   hostname of the computer on which it is running in the From: header.
   To avoid this from happening, set use-only-domain-name in Pine's SETUP
   CONFIGURATION menu to Yes; this strips the name of the specific host
   from your From: address. Alternatively, specify your domain name in
   user-domain (be sure you enter it correctly, otherwise all your
   outgoing messages will have an invalid return address! Ask your local
   computing support people if in doubt). When setting either of these
   options, also read the help screen for
   quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file to see whether you should enable that
   feature too.
   
   Administrators of systems where Pine exhibits this behavior should
   also check the /etc/hosts file for invalid entries; as an example, it
   should read:

  123.456.78.90   hostname.domain    hostname

   not just
  123.456.78.90   hostname

   -- otherwise, users' setting of use-only-domain-name to Yes will not
   have the intended effect.

  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as fetchmail (which supercedes
   popclient) can be used to download email from a POP server to a local
   Unix account, where it can then be accessed with Pine. fetchmail can
   be obtained from:
   http://locke.ccil.org:80/~esr/esr-freeware.html#fetchmail
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

Hi. If you look at the header of this note, you'll notice that in
parentheses, where it should be showing CST for my time-zone, it has in
its place a control-A. Can anyone let me know why Pine wouldn't be reading
my time zone correctly, why the control-A, and how I can fix this? It's
screwing up the colors on a lot of people's screens. Thanks very much.

Bruce

Message-ID: <01bbe809$5fc61f70$0f7847c7@radix>

Anyone who is trying to compile Imap4 BETA from ftp.cac.washington.edu on
BSD/OS should be aware that one bug in the /usr/bin/false command.  The
makefile calls the script in src/afs/afs-patches and it passes a command called
"false" (or true if you have AFS).  Apparently false is not behaving the
correct way, so this script always includes the AFS includes and vars to build
the c-client makefile.  BSD/OS compilation will choke on this.

The solution is simple, just comment out everything in the afs-patches script
file and you're on your way.  I'm not sure why /usr/sbin/false is not working,
I'll probably look into the BSD/OS 2.1 source on the cdrom tomorrow.

Hi,
I just finished compiling Pine3.95 on my linux system. I have encountered a few
problems that hopefully you will be able to help me with (or forward this
message to the rigth address).
What I'm trying to do is to connect to an IMAP server (on a UNIX box) using
pine3.95(*nix, too). The problem that I have is that UNIX-pine will not let me
set the user-id to the user-id on the machine where I keep the mail: ie my
usename on this machine is "mhalpern", and my username on the linux system is
"mnh". I understand that 1) Pine gives me the option of changing the user-id
when it connects to the mailserver, but I also have to enter my
username/password _every_ time I go to to a different folder, and this becomes
rather anoying after 3 or 4 times; and 2) Being able to do that (overriding the
passwd file) could be a security problem, but as I said, it's rather annoying to
have to login 3 or 4 times to be able to read my mail...
I have traced this down to pine/init.c and changed the entries to:

#if defined(DOS) || defined(OS2)
                        /* Have to have this on DOS, PC's, Macs, etc... */
{"user-id",                    0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
#else                   /* Don't allow on UNIX machines for some security */
{"user-id",                    0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
#endif				       /^\
				        |

but that doesn't seem to change anything (Well, it gives me the entry user-id
under Main/Setup/Config, but still the same problem connecting with a different
user-id). Is there anything I'm doing wrong? How can I set this up???

The second (minor) question that I have is: is there any way to _disable_ the
rsh connection to the server? I know it's not as secure, but my mail server is
not running any of the r* commands, so the rest of my *NIX machines on the
network time out trying to connect to it, and then they connect over the
standar IMAP port, wich delays the connection a few seconds... anything that I
can do about it, besides setting up rsh-imapd on the other side? Security is not
a big problem here, the mail machine is bechind a firewall, and so are the rest
of the *NIX machines on the network....


Thank you very much,

--Nico Halpern.

On HP-UX, the default terminal emulation usually is "hpterm", at least in a
X Windows environment; but I'm quite sure that HP forces its own emulation
to be used in every environment.
We are using HP-UX V10.01 with VUE (Visual User Environment, X11/Motif
compliant). Pine only works as expected if you use "xterm" terminal emulation.

Yes:
Go to: (M)ain Menu -> (S)etup -> (C)onfig

Then, scroll down until you see the "speller" option (it's very near
the bottom for me).  Select it, then choose [(C)hange Val], and type
in the name of the spelling program you want (i.e. "ispell").

Two things to take note of here:
1) I'm using Pine 3.95.  I don't know how recently this feature was
added, but I think it's pretty new.  So, if you're using an older
version, the "speller" option may not be there.

2) ispell must be installed on your system.  If it's not in your path,
you may have to provide the complete path to it.


I tried to keep this quick and to the point, and so I assumed that
you're familiar with Pine.  If you need more detailed help, feel free
to mail me directly, or followup to the group if you feel that's
appropriate.

Close... the standard port number for an IMAP server is actually 143,
not 147.

Another way: type your 100 persons e-mail addresses in a Distribution
List and send the message to the list using the LCC: (List Carbon Copy).
It will show only the name of the Distribution List. This is a relatively
new features in pine.

If I have a text file in my Unix account with a list of e-mail addresses

Hi. I'm using Pine from a Unix shell account. This provider has several
servers attached to it. The shell server is not the same as the mail
server. Thus, mail doesn't automatically come to a place where Pine can
reach it. The way I solved the problem is to FTP to the mail server, which
is also the web server, and put a .forward file in my home directory there
with the address of the shell server, which (lucky for me) can still grab
mail, even though it's not the primary mail server. Is this the most
efficient way of accomplishing what I need to accomplish? Another service
I know of uses a pop client to grab the mail whenever you invoke Pine. I
find this to be quite inconvenient. My .forward file technique seems a lot
more transparent. The disadvantage is that I can't use ma PPP program to
pick up mail from the normal mail server if I want to, because it
automatically gets forwarded over to the shell server. But it's a
relatively small price to pay. Basically, I'm just wondering if I'm being
as efficient as I can be in this regard.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I'd like to be able to specify a subject line for new mail
messages set up from the subject line, the same way you can
with mailx. E.g. if the '-s' switch was interpreted as the
"subject" option, I'd like to be able to do things like
this:

	pine -s "urgent memo" my-boss@dev.nul

This would make pine an acceptable plug-in substitute for
mailx in terms of easy command line mailing capabilities,
which is a Good Thing.

I don't care, but I noticed, that many users are can't aggregate the infos
in the filter man pages, the elm filter guide and pine help.

So I just thought of a step-by-step instuction how to configure pine, 
filter-rules and .forward, nothing more.

Would have been more work for me than I already have, so maybe it's best 
not to do it.

BTW: Not to know, that pine doesn't support monitoring multiple inboxes,
when the helpfiles doesn't mention it (at least I didn't found anything 
about that), doesn't mean I don't understand how email works.

Ciao,

Zterm is good for modem connection.

Use Comit if you have ethernet connection.  NiftyTelnet is fine, too.
Play around with optional key functions while you are at it.  I use
Comit most of time.  Haven't used NCSA Telnet for a few years.

I've been using the os/2 port to read just a couple of newsgroups. I
don't post, but recently a friend installed linux and wanted me to test
some of his setup before going online.

He setup a 'test' newsgroup, and I used the os/2 Pine to send a test
message to that group. His news, though, wouldn't accept my posting
because there was a lack of domain information left by Pine. Normally, the
message ID should read something like 'PineOS2xxxxxxxxxx@domain.com', but
on the postings that I tried, it would simply put 'PineOS2xxxxx@'. Here is
the important stuff from pinerc:

Anyway, I just used the servers Pine to send this *G*. I hope someone
might be able to tell me what the matter is.

Hello all of you,

In a previous version there was a bug that reset the default value of the
Fcc: field when the To: field was `visited' again.

This bug is back in 3.95 !

Is there any way to correct it ?

1. Please remember to put a Subject in your posts; it makes reading the
   group much more pleasant.

2. You can define your own default headers (the headers you'll see each
   time you compose a message).  Go into setup (S,C from the Main Menu),
   find the option called "default-composer-hdrs" and hit "?" for help
   on this option.

3. You can set your default FCC: to "<Empty Value>" by going to the setup
   option call "default-fcc" and replacing the current value with a pair of
   empty double quotes.

I've been trying to set up an address book with PC-Pine v3.95
running under NT 4.0.  Pine crashes (Dr. Watson/GPF) anytime I try
to do *anything* with the Address book function.

I've also tried this with NT 3.51 and Windows95, and the same thing
happens.  Does anyone know if the Address book even works in Pine
3.95 under Windows?  If so, what must I do to use it?

Does anyone have or know of a place that I can get a Pine executable for
an Intergraph machine running Clix OS.  I think Clix is a flavor of Unix
for running CAD type workstation applications.  It's for a friend.

Yes, definitely! All you have to do is...

(1) quit pine, then you will go to the $ prompt.
(2) at the $ prompt, type

	pico .addressbook <enter> or
	vi .addressess <enter>

(3) you can now edit the .addressess file. 

You can also create your own file, using your own
defined filename and then choose Setup(S):Config(C)
from the main menu of Pine and change the default
addressbook to you desired filename. 

Good luck!

All you have to do is set the remote news server (Setup Config
nntp-server) and restart pine. A newsgroup folder collection will be
automatically created, and a .newsrc if it doesn't already exist.

I don't remember where to find that list, but the machine news.vsnl.net.in
exists, so that is probably your local news server.

I periodically perform this exercise in frustration by asking if anyone
can tell me how to tab from one header field to the next using the
initial keystroke option, -i. From the console, the tab or enter key
works fine, but I cannot find a way to embed those keystrokes in my
keystroke list. I can get into the compose mode all right, but then it
interprets everything as an address.

Try the PGP User's Mailing List home page at http://pgp.rivertown.net/
There is a link to mkpgp2.1 which is a csh script.  If you don't have their
key, it will get it for you, etc., etc.  You set it up as an alternate
editor.  It's very good, I've been using it for about 6 months.

Pine figures that you know you sent it so it shows you where you sent it.
When I look at your message in the index, it shows your name and not "TO:
comp.mail.pine".  When you see this message in the index you will see my
name, but I will see "TO: comp.mail.pine".  Rest assured that everybody
but you will see your name.

I'd like to split out the individual messages from the digests I've got.
Is there a simple way of doing this?  

Thanks muchly...

If you are subscribed to a mailing list that runs on listserv 1.8C, you
have the option of having your digests sent to you as a message with a
mime-encoded attachment for each message. Hope this helps.

That would be nice, but I believe the ones I am interested in are all
generated by majordomo instead of listserv.  

Thanks anyway...

Actually, Pine 3.92 and later _filter_ the control characters out by
default.  The default was changed to protect the users with terminals
that can't handle ANSI characters (some terminals will lock completely
with certain sequences).

You can revert to the old behavior by selecting
the pass-control-characters-as-is feature in the Setup/Config screen.

Just be aware that not everyone has terminals that support ANSI
controls...

Subject: ANSI escape code support in 3.95?
Date: 16 Dec 1996 19:30:18 GMT
Message-ID: <59480a$ifm@ccshst05.cs.uoguelph.ca>

We recently jumped from Pine3.91 to Pine3.95 (HP-UX 9.05) and found that
ANSI character codes in the message text body ( e.g. bolding of text ) no
longer seems to work. The codes are just displayed unfiltered and not
interpreted. Is this a function of the new display filtering code in 3.92
onwards?  If so, are there any workarounds anyone knows of that would
allow these characters to be interpreted. A user likes to have fancy bold
boxes around their .sig This is not a high priority item - I just need to
know if this is do-able. I checked the change logs for the various
releases and couldn't see anything definitive. 

Thanks for any info.

We have a pure Solaris 2.5 network, and are thinking of using pine.
We very much want to NFS export /var/mail, and are not sure what the
warnings in the FAQ really mean.

So we would very much appreciate as much input as possible.  Please
remember that we have, by design, a homogeneous network, and do not
face interoperability problems.

Thanks!

	Take a look at:

        FEATURE: pass-control-characters-as-is
 
This feature controls how certain characters contained in messages are
displayed.  If set, all characters in a message will be sent to the
screen.  Normally, control characters are automatically suppressed in
order to avoid inadvertently changing terminal setup parameters.

Same here.  The last screen doesn't print but the bottom help lines do.  
Perhaps if we turned them off to print?

Are you sending your mails as MIME attachments like your posting to this group?
Maybe that has something to do with it.

Try using Zterm 1.0.1, it works for me.

Hi,

I like the imap-4.1 package from the University of Washington, but I
cannot figure out how to use the c-client to connect to a plain POP3
server and read the mail from there!

Any of you got any experiences (sure there are!) using this package in
connection with POP3? Maybe point me to some educational examples (not
pine or other imap-utils from U. of W.)?

Thanks! And merry christmas!!

/Jake

The problem is not with pine.
I had this problem.  Upgraded my sendmail/sendmail.cf and local delivery
program and it went away.

There is also a References header in mail. This is meant to be used to
refer to other e-mail messages that are related to the message being sent,
but not one of its precursors. Its counterpart in news is See-Also.

The References header in news corresponds to the In-Reply-To header in mail.

Often, gateways between mail and news don't change In-Reply-To to
References, which means that the user can't read his news threaded.

Hi,

I think the algorithm is documented in RFC-1522.  This should be available
on the RFC web page at ds.internic.net.  Also, the MIME source code is
available from ftp.cac.washington.edu and has an implementation of it in
source code.  Check the "mail" directory for the c-client library on this
FTP site.

Cary

Jakob,
If you are developing software based on the c-client libraries, you might
want to consider joining the c-client developers list:

    There is a configuration option to include attachments in the
reply.  Toggle that on.

    In the addressbook, you can set up distribution lists, so that a
nickname stands for any (reasonable) number of addresses all at once. 
It should be explained in the online help screens for the addressbook.

There isn't a problem with this.  Pine only cares about what's

To get to the ftp server, if you are using UNIX:

	ftp ftp.demon.co.uk
	login you enter "anonymous"
	password you enter your email address
	at the "ftp" prompt, you may enter a "?" for help.

Just noticed that one year of archived sent messages were changed
from who they were sent to, to my name or address, which means that they
have to be opened to see where they went.

Question 1. How did this happen?

Question 2. Are they correctible?

Dear, Houghton Mifflin Pub. Corp.

When I heard all I had to do was E-mail your company to have a book sent
to a sick kid and that I should pass the word I did.  Hopefully you will
recieve an E-mail from these fine people especially since they are all
associated with education in some fashion.  Thanks for caring.

Guy A. Harrell

P.S. note to CC's all you've got to do is E-mail them and they will give a
book to sick children in need.  They recieved 23,000 E-mails last year
they have about 3,400 before today and for every E-mail they recieve they
give another book, so pass the work quick.

Can't you use the arrow keys to scroll the text? That works in all the

Are the newsrc formats for the PCPine versions compatible with the Linux

Fill a large spray bottle with gasoline, go into a small room and start
spraying.  When the bottle's empty, light a match.  Merry Christmas!

I haven't received any answers yet regarding the fact that Pine puts a
control-A in my message header instead of the CST for the time zone. Can
someone tell me where Pine gets this information from? Maybe I can start
from there. Thank you.

And why must that feature be specifically enabled? What harms could there
be if it was always active, without options?

Pine calls the tzset(3) function and reads the time zone from the
tzname[] global variable.  See the man page for tzset(3)...

I received an e-mail that has an attachment file within the body of the 
text (something like an ASCII file within the text).

I understand that you have been dealing with UU-decode and e-mail.

I quote: "If you're sent a uuencoded file as an attachment (though I don't
see why anyone would use both!), you can (in Pine 3.9x) V (View) the
attachment, then | (Pipe) it to uudecode."

But it doesn't work fine with me, I issue the following commands:

   1) In Pine (v3.91 in Unix) I receive the e-mail with the attached file,
      with the ASCII file within the text. 

   2) I Export the whole message to a file (i.e. email.txt) in my Unix
      disk

   3) I edit (with Pico) this email.txt file, and I add an End line at the
      end of the "ASCII" lines.

      At the beginning of the "ASCII" part it says: Begin 666 gf.pdf

   4) When I run the uudecode command in Unix it says: Short file
        $ uudecode email.txt
        Short file

      but it generates de correspondent gf.pdf file

   5) But the application program, that it was the creator of this gf.pdf,
      can not read it

What can I do?. Will you be so kind and help me.

Gas Daily

Dear Francisco:

I am sorry we're having problems with the attached GD.PDF file. I am
attaching the (binary) file to my (ASCII) e-mail,
but it appears your e-mail software is reattaching it.

I believe the problem is that our system UU-encodes binary files for
transmission over the Internet (all files must be
in ASCII text to be transmitted). This means your system must use
UU-decoding to turn the file back into a binary file.
I am guessing your system is using a different encryption method, namely MIME.

For the purposes of sending you a copy of Gas Daily, the problem can be
resolved in a number of ways. Here are
some examples:

Post you a copy
Fax you a copy
Manually UU-decode the attached file
Subscribe to CompuServe, America Online, or another service that supports
UU-decoding

Please advise me as to the technique we should use. I have again attached a
copy of Gas Daily (GD.PDF) in the
hope you can UU-decode it.

I hope we can iron this problem out soon.
Sincerely,

David Bottorff
Editor
Gas Daily

Hi there!

Can anyone please tell me how to get PINE to forward my mail to another
email address while I am on vacation?  I'm on a UNIX system at work with
a firewall and will be out for a week and wish to receive my mail at
another location.

Thanks so much.

     Sandra:
     
     To get PINE to forward your e-mail on a UNIX system, simply create a 
     text file in your home directory called ".forward" and include a 
     one-line entry for your new e-mail address:
     
          .forward
               username@company.com
     
     That's all there is to it.

Hi All, I am at the University of Washington using PINE from home. I heard
from someone that I maybe can use Eudora Pro to UW instead of PINE or with
PINE or something similar? Eudora would be nicer than Pine from home, (no
offense) Thanks for the info, ya'll, J

    There is no way currently to do this with Pine.  In the opinion of
some people, the lack of killfile capability is a rather glaring and
major shortcoming of Pine as a newsreader.  Some day.... Some day....
On a Un*x-like system, I use a kludge involving trn.  It isn't perfect,
but it's better than nothing.  However, it has nothing to do with Pine
as such, so I won't go into in on this newsgroup.  If you are on a
Un*x-like system and are interested, email me and I will send you the
script, although you will have to learn about trn killfiles on your
own.

    Your question is important and meaningful, but it doesn't have
anything to do with the purpose of this newsgroup, which is Pine, not
Procmail.  There is a mailing list dedicated to all sorts of arcane
Procmail questions.  You might find more assistance there.

Try "./build lnx" instead of "build lnx".

You seem to be running some other program called "build" that wants a .s
file.  My guess is that it's an assembler.  By using ./build instead, you
force the use of Pine's build.

Hi,

While it's easy to define a new folder collection, is there any way to use
it as a destination for fcc-by-recipient?  There's nowhere in config
(3.95) that lets you set a path for anything other than default-fcc.

Hi, I use pine to send/receive mail.  I use fetchmail to get pop mail from
my server, but I send mail out directly.  My address locally is
oakley@conti.oz.net but my address that I use (due to lack of smtp
queueing) is conti@oz.net.  I use reply-to, but many systems don't
awknowledge it.  I heard you can enter a From: header in custom headers,
but that you had to compile it to allow you to do so.  I've tried From:
and it doesn't work.  What option do I have to set when compiling to allow
me to enter From: headers?  I looked through the source for something that
looked useful, but couldn't figure it out.
Thanks!

In pine.conf, set

This can also be selected per-user in the Setup/Config screen...

	Using pine 3.95?  Check out the feature of the Address book....
You will find what you want....with a little reading.

 Hullo. I am very very new to UNIX and I need some step by step help in
setting up Procmail and a recipe. I've looked at several references, but
I'm still lost on some basics. To give you an idea: How is the recipe
called? Procmail has so many flags that I can't imagine how long I'll
spend trying to find out which flag I should or shouldn't be using... :)
 What I'm hoping someone will be able to do is give me a step by step list
that would contain friendly tips that may have been overlooked in the
Procmail documentation...I don't want anyone to use up a lot of time
explaining everything in detail when that has already been done in the
documentation.
 If someone could give me a template recipe and a few steps aimed at a
complete UNIX beginner plus one or two of their favourite references, that
would be perfect.
 Thank you very much for your time.
 Hugo

Here are two great web pages to check out for Eudora-related software and
information:

<http://www.amherst.edu/~atstarr/eudora/eudora.html>
For Andrew Starr's personal web page which contains possibly every
third-party utility which is designed to work with Eudora Pro. 



<http://mango.human.cornell.edu/kens/MoreFAQ.html#Convert>
For information on converting to Eudora from tons of other mail clients,
and back to those other clients. Also, this page contains info on such
things as the TOC (Table Of Contents) file format.

Hello All,

I wish to set up my home pc to retrieve mail from my local Internet
Service Provider, I am using Linux and I know little about how to do
this. My ISP uses PoP3 protocol and I tried to set up my sendmail.cf 
file by replacing it with one that was supposed to work.When I ran my
script to start sendmail and popclient, my screen was filled with 
error messages refering to the sendmail.cf file?
I know I have not given very specific infomation but could someone
point me in the right direction to get things up and running.

Thanks in advance,   Richard Ashton. mailto:ashtons@ans.com.au

	Ensure the permissions on the .forward file are set to be
world-readable.  

	Other than that....contact the "helpdesk" at VSNL Bombay.

PINE assumes you know that you sent it and it is therefore unnecessary to
list yourself as author.  If you want to change this, you can change this
in the setup menu by adding in the following under "index-format":

	STATUS MSGNO DATE FROM(33%) SUBJECT(67%)

This should then force PINE to list yourself as author.  Hope this helps.

Hi there,

I have this problem that Pine often crashes UNIX machines. I am using 3.95
on a sun4. Does anybody else has this problem?

The behavior is as follows:  You are typing an email in pine and suddenly
the machine doesn't respond anymore. All the xterms you have on the
machine become very slow.  Sometimes there is just enough time to type in
`top', and you can see that pine takes 70 - 80% of the CPU time. Then,
after a few seconds, it's over.  Sometimes pine displays the message:
"Cannot allocate 16 bytes", even when I am alone here and running no other
processes than an xterm. 

Who has the same problem? Who can help me? 

Regards,
Koen.

These days, with sendmail 8.7 and above in use in more and more places,
the only places I really get return receipts from are places that use
Microsoft Exchange for mail.  I've not taken the header out, just
because it doesn't seem to hurt.

Subject: Changing Pines editor to vi or emacs
Date: 19 Dec 1996 03:22:44 GMT
Message-ID: <59ace4$700@nntp-3.io.com>

I hope this isn't a FAQ but I'm used to using vi (and trying to learn
emacs) and I'm wondering if there is a way to use Pine as a mail reader
with vi or emacs as the editor, because (no offense to people who like
pico or programmed it) I find pico really annoying. I like how in vi
you can move a paragraph at a time, and delete as such.... and I'm just
used to the #*$!ing thing :)

So how do I set up Pine to use vi (or pico so that it emulates vi) as
the editor?

	When you did the "ftp" did you ensure the transfer mode was
binary?  At the ftp prommpt "ftp>" issue the "bin" command before
the "get".

> What i must doing with getted files ? Where is instructions ?

	The following outline should help....

1.	Change the mode of the files to make they executable.
	chmod 555 "file-name".  (Do a "man chmod" to read about the
	chmod command).

2.	Rename the files to something you can remember.
	mv pine-bin.linux pine  for example.  (Read the man page for
	the mv command.)

3.	Move the files to someplace in your "PATH".  

	Hope that helps...

$$$$ $50,000 for the New Year $$$$

Take five minutes to read this and it WILL change your life.
 
The Internet has grown tremendously. It doubles in size every 4 months. think about it. You see those 'Make.Money.Fast' posts more and more.
That's ... because it WORKS !  So I thought, all those new users might
make it work. And I decided to try it out, a few months ago. Besides,
whats $5.00, I spend more than that in the morning on my way to work
on coffee and cigs for the day. So I sent in my money and posted.Everyone was calling it a scam, but there are SO many new users from AOL, Netcom, etc. they will join in and make it work for you.

Well, two weeks later, I began recieving bucks in the mail!  I
couldn't believe it! Not just a little, I mean big bucks!  At first only a few hundred dollars, then a week later, a couple of thousand, then BOOM.
By the end of the fourth week, I had recieved nearly $47,000.00. It came
from all over the world. And every bit of it perfectly legal and on
the up and up. I've been able to pay off all my bills and still had
enough left over for a nice vacation for me and my family.

Not only does it work for me, it works for other folks as well. Markus
Valppu says he made $57,883 in four weeks. Dave Manning claims he
made $53,664 in the same amount of time. Dan Shepstone says it was only
$17,000 for him. Do I know these folks? No, but when I read how they say they did it, it made sense to me. Enough sense that I'm taking a similar chance with $5 of my own bucks. Not a big chance, I admit--but one with incredible potential, because $5 is all anyone ever invests in this system. Period. That's all Markus, Dave, or Dan invested, yet their $5 netted them tens of thousands of dollars each, in a safe, legal, completely legitimate way. Here's how it works in 3 easy steps:

STEP 1.

Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate
pieces of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST."
(In this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone; you're paying
for a legitimate service.) Fold a $1 bill inside each paper, and mail them by standard U. S. Mail to the following five addresses:
 
 1-Aaron McDaniel
     2014 Powell Dr.
     ElCajon, Ca 92020 

 2-Faroon Khan
     12343 77A Avenue
     Surrey, BC V3W2W9

 3-Hoffman Eric
     3150 Riviere-Cachee
     Boisbriand, PQ
     Canada
     J7H 1A3

 4-Stuart Koch  
     Connolly Hall Box C115
     501 E. St. Joseph
     Rapid City, SD 57701-3995

 5-Karen Lundgren
     3889 Kencrest Ave.
     Halifax, NS
     Canada
     B3K 3L4

STEP 2.

    Now remove the top name from the list, and move the
    other names up.This way, #5 becomes #4 and so on.
    Put your name in as the fifth one on the list.


STEP 3.

    Post the article to at least 250 newsgroups. There are at
    least 19000 newsgroups at any given moment in time.
    Try posting to as many newsgroups as you can. Remember
    the more groups you post to, the more people will see your
    article and send you cash!


STEP 4.

    You are now in business for yourself, and should start seeing
    returns within 7 to 14 days! Remember, the Internet is new
    and huge. There is no way you can lose.
 
    Now here is how and why this system works:
 
    Out of every block of 250 posts I made, I got back 5 responses.
    Yes, thats right,only 5. You make $5.00 in cash, not checks or
    money orders, but real cash with your name at #5.
 
    Each additional person who sent you $1.00 now also makes 250
    additional postings with your name at #4, 1000 postings. On
    average then, 50 people will send you $1.00 with your name at
    #4,....$50.00 in your pocket!
 
    Now these 50 new people will make 250 postings each with your
    name at #3 or 10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.
    They make 250 postings each with your name at #2= 100,000
    postings=5000 returns at $1.00 each=$5,000.00 in cash!
 
    Finally, 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at
    #1 and you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off
    the list.And that's only if everyone down the line makes only 250
    postings each! Your total income for this one cycle is $55,000.
 
    From time to time when you see your name is no longer on the list,
    you take the latest posting you can find and start all over again.

                The end result depends on you. You must follow through
                and repost this article everywhere you can think of.
                The more  postings you  make, the more cash ends up in
                your mailbox. It's too easy and too cheap to pass up!!!

    So thats it. Pretty simple sounding stuff, huh? But believe me, it
    works. There are millions of people surfing the net every day, all
    day, all over the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net
    every day. You know that, you've seen the stories in the paper.
    So, my friend, read and follow the simple instructions and play
    fair. Thats the key, and thats all there is to it. Print this out
    right now so you can refer back to this article easily. Try to keep
    an eye on all the postings you made to make sure everyone is
    playing fairly. You know where your name should be.

    If you're really not sure or still think this can't be
    for real, then don't do it. But please print this article and pass
    it along to someone you know who really needs the bucks, and see
    what happens.

    REMEMBER....HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.YOU DON'T
    NEED TO CHEAT THE BASIC IDEA TO MAKE THE BUCKS!
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL, AND PLEASE PLAY FAIR AND YOU WILL
    WIN AND MAKE SOME REAL INSTANT FREE CASH!

*** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages
with your name in the list and not sending the bucks to the people
already included, you will not get much. I know someone who did this
and only got about $150 (and that's after two months). Then he sent
the 5 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had
over $10,000!

                TRY IT AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY!!!  :o) !!!!!!!!!!

Subject: How to implement PGP in Pine ?
Date: 20 Dec 1996 09:55:47 GMT
Message-ID: <59dnr3$qut@sugar.h.belgacom.be>

Hi all,

I'd like to find any document about how to use PGP in Pine.
I know there are some stuff on some pages on the Net, but first i've not
access to the Net, and two, it's more easy to print any doc, and read it
coolly...:-)) So, is such document existing, and if yes, where can i find it ?
Thanks a lot.

As a number of people mentioned to me when I had the same request last
week, create a file with the email address you want your mail forwarded
to and put it in your directory on the UNIX server you use PINE on. Name
it: ".forward" be sure the file contains only the email address and no
extraneous characters such as end of file or end of page characters. 

I know this works since I am using it now.

A couple of people suggested terminfo description problems, so I decided to
inspect them.  After inspecting the terminfo entries for xterm on my home
machine, nova and novaold (using infocmp), and discovering that they were all
identical, I decided to kill the remote session in the xterm where I
normally run pine, and try a local jove in that window.  It screwed up in
exactly the same way.  I did a Ctrl-MidButton "Full Reset", and things are
cleared up.

The little bitty stuff can sure grind your ass.

Thanks for the suggestions.

I would like to report a bug or problem in our computer at home.
When I turned it on, it said that there was no thing as a folder open when
I opened my inbox.  I don't know what happened.  Only the messages in my
inbox were erased, and no longer there.  
I hope you could find the problem along with a solution.  
Thanks
Aimee

The incoming messages in inbox are not in any other file in my e-mail
group. Is there anything I can do?

	If you machine is a 166Mhz Pentium or better with 1.2GB of disk
space then kindly package it and send it to the address below and I will
take a look at the problem and report back.  :-) :-)

Hi,

	I have a mailing list of about 100 addresses. I want to hide all the addresses. It can be done by Bcc.
Fine!! But is it possible that the addressee sees only his address in the 'To:  ' column when he receives the 
mail. That is each of these 100 people should see only their name in the mail received. Is this possble!!!!
e-mail reply is preferred.

Cheers,
Bharath Kumar.

  I have been using pine for about a year and a half now.  With this new
update, I am getting the message "[Incomplete maildomain "mailer".]" and
then "[Return address in mail you send may be incorrect.]"
  I didn't know if I needed to mail you, or my server.
  Thank you,

difficulty finding my message and when found it, no commands would
respond. finally lost by composed message before i could send it.
	how do i find a message that was interrupted when my fone line
disconnected and was reconnected? there seems no applicable folder in
which it would end up.

Perhaps you should be Extremely Brave and Pluck Up Your Courage... and
look in Pine's "Setup" screen: you know, the thing you see mentioned on
the Main Menu whenever you start Pine?

At the Main Menu:

	S C		... go to Setup Configuration screen
	w editor	... do a "whereis" to look for the word "editor"
			    amongst the list of options
	?		... ask Pine for help about the option.

Hint: you should find several options with the word "editor" in them, all
affecting which editor is used and how you get into it.  Have a look at
the help information for each of them.

Cheers,

The reason that the aggregate command set is not enabled by default is, I
believe, the aim of keeping Pine simple to use for novice users.  This
includes protecting them against some of the more powerful commands, at
least until they have gained sufficient experience with general use of
Pine so as not to be thrown by them.

If Systems Administrator disagress with this policy (s)he can quite easily
"turn the option on" for everyone simply by adding the appropriate line to
the systemwide configuration file used by Pine.

Cheers,

If you have no access to the Internet, how can you post this article to
a netsgroup?  WWW is only one part of the Net.  Email, FTP, Gopher, and 
many other things exist.

If you have figured out how to access WWW, here is a URL for the web 
pages on PGP in Pine (Unix):

	NEWS existed for quite some time very nicely without a connection
to the Internet.  Many people still have access to NEWS without a
connection to the Internet since NEWS can (and does) travel in a store and
forward fashion similar to UUCP.  So, *yes* it is quite possible to post
news and read news without access to the Internet and all of its features.

	Regards,

		Ed

Hi.  I've been using pine on my Linux box for some time now, and want to
install it on my Win95 machine.  I have unzipped it, and followed the
installation instructions as far as I know, but keep getting 2 errors
which drive me nuts:

1.  Access error when trying to open mail folders.

2.  Can't "C"ompose mail; get error saying "Can't send message without
an open remote folder."

Ideas?

Thanks!

If I press print when the printer is either off-line, or spimply not
turned on, I get the message printer error, giving me various options.
When I gine the command to discard, or to try again, the entire system
locks up.  I cannot even get out of pine into DOS.  I have to turn off the
computer and restart, then get into the server and pine once more.

What is the solution to this irritating problem?

Thank you.

Hello,

I work on an SGI Onyx IRIX 5.3 and pine is not working anymore since the
machine crashed and the file /etc/sendmail.cf has been replaced by a new
one.
Now pine does not work on my machine. Also, when it was working before the
time was screwed at -500h previous the date I send it! Could you give me a
tip for I find some documentation to configure and fix these problem. Here
is an attachament of my sendmail.cf file if you want to take a look. My
domain
is creol.ucf.edu (University of Central Florida, orlando) and the name of
the worstation is 'vision'. I thank you for your help.

have a great day

yohan

I have a problem with Pico, the Pine editor. I am running Pine 3.95 on a
SunOS 4.1.3 machine. If I cut and paste text from elsewhee and try to
insert it into a message, I get total garbage if the message already
contains text after the insertionpoint. The pasted text will be scattered
throughout the other text, and teh formatting of the text already there is
totally destroyed. This even happens if I am typing in text. blank lines
between the text I am typing and the text already there will disappear and
then the text already there will get swallowed up in the text that is
there.

If I now have the signature in the text properly formatted, and then
insert something else in front of it, here is what I get (Note what I have

Ie, even though I inserted the text in front of the signature, it ended up
half after a mangled signature.


What is going on here? Is there some way of correcting this (some
misconfiguration?)

The first problem causes the second - you can't compose mail if you
haven't opened a remote folder.

Are you running imapd on your linux?  If not, see if you have imapd in
your /etc/hosts and /etc/inetd.conf commented out.  If you do,
uncomment it, and restart inetd.  If not, get imapd and install it,
either from your linux distribution or from wherever you got Pine.

If you are running imapd, are you specifying the remote mail folder as
{foo} where foo is the hostname of your linux?

You could try mail4u, a UUCP transport provider for MS Exchange. It can
be used together with other transport providers like MS-mail.

Have a look at http://www.mail4u.atnet.at

You can play whatever sound you want with MS Exchange for mail
notificiation.
Auto-replies, aliases for multiple users can be configured in UUCP.

Joseph has conversion scripts available for five major
e-mail packages, including one to convert Pine
addressbooks to Eudora nickname files.

    This I cannot help you with, as I am not familiar with elm and do
not know what its forms look like and how they work.

    Yes.  From the Main Menu, go into Setup and Configuration.  Look
for a field called customized-hdrs (or something like that).  You may
add your own legal headers (unless the system administrator has set
Pine up in such a way as to prevent you from making personal changes 
to the configuration).  When you add the header fields, you may either
put values in them so they will always be there, or you may leave a
field value blank so that you have to add it individually or not for
each message, as you decide.  (You may need to invoke Rich Headers to 
see the added headers.)
 
>  ps. I use PINE-3.91.

    If I remember correctly, customizable headers were already
available in version 3.91.

  Uh, actually, Pine will not forward your mail at all.  It isn't
designed to.  However, since you are asking for a Un*x system, go to
your home directory and create a one-line file called exactly .forward
and containing nothing but the email address to which the mail is to be
forwarded.  I'm honestly not sure if the firewall makes any difference.

	Please tell us more of what you expect of "MIME aware Tools".
Pine is a MIME aware User Agent.  Does that qualify?

	Also, there is a newsgroup devoted to MIME.  Have you tried
there?

This is a frequently asked question.

The user has some sort of "check for new mail" background task running.
This periodically opens a POP3 connection to probe the user's mailbox.

In the UNIX mbox format, only one process can have the mailbox opened in
read/write mode at a time.  In our implementation, if a new process
discovers that some other process has the mailbox read/write, it sends a
"kiss of death" to the old process requesting that it kill itself so the
new process can acquire read/write mode.

This is done because PCs, Macs, and similar toy computers tend to crash
frequently.  This leaves stuck servers at the other end.  After the user
reboots her toy computer and tries to connect again, she expects to be
able to get at her mail and not be told "you already have it open, go
away."

The POP3 protocol specification specifically forbids more than one active
POP3 session per user on a server at a time.  So the choice is either "new
kills old" or "you already have it open, go away".

So, why are your users getting a Kiss of Death?

There are a number of little background programs (TSRs and the like)
floating around which "check for new mail".  They work by periodically
connecting to the POP3 server to see what new mail exists.

Guess what happens when this background task fires off when the user has
an active POP3 session.  You got it, that POP3 session gets killed.

The immediate fix is to stop using those "check for new mail" background
tasks.  If the user really insists upon using one, get ahold of one which
does a query via IMAP4 instead of POP3.  IMAP4 has a "STATUS" command
which will return information about new mail without requiring a
read/write lock.  POP3 has no such choice.

Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, Questions & Answers, and information on where to
   obtain the software, can be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer -- whichever organization provided you with the
   email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number of
   Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users.
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
     * If you are posting a question to the Pine Discussion Forum but do
       not subscribe to it, request in your message that replies be sent
       directly to you, with a copy to the forum. (Conversely, if you are
       answering a question in the Pine Discussion Forum, be sure to
       include the inquirer's email address in your reply, since s/he may
       not be a subscriber and will otherwise not see your answer).

  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.

  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does my message index show From: instead of To:?
  
   Applies to Pine for Unix only
   
   A number of Pine 3.95 users have reported seeing their own name,
   rather than the name of the recipient, in folder index listings of
   messages they have sent. This occurs when Pine detects the specific
   hostname of the computer on which it is running in the From: header.
   To avoid this from happening, set use-only-domain-name in Pine's SETUP
   CONFIGURATION menu to Yes; this strips the name of the specific host
   from your From: address. Alternatively, specify your domain name in
   user-domain (be sure you enter it correctly, otherwise all your
   outgoing messages will have an invalid return address! Ask your local
   computing support people if in doubt). When setting either of these
   options, also read the help screen for
   quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file to see whether you should enable that
   feature too.
   
   Administrators of systems where Pine exhibits this behavior should
   also check the /etc/hosts file for invalid entries; as an example, it
   should read:

  123.456.78.90   hostname.domain    hostname

   not just
  123.456.78.90   hostname

   -- otherwise, users' setting of use-only-domain-name to Yes will not
   have the intended effect.

  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as fetchmail (which supercedes
   popclient) can be used to download email from a POP server to a local
   Unix account, where it can then be accessed with Pine. fetchmail can
   be obtained from:
   http://locke.ccil.org:80/~esr/esr-freeware.html#fetchmail
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

Hi folks!
I don't understand why my pine hangs when it tries to write on 
sent-mail file. 
After about 5 minutes of waiting it complains that sent-mail is 
locked...
What's going on?

Thanks in advance,
						Filippo

	The header showed SUN in the messageID.  So, tht would make it 
SunOS4.X.  It would still be nice to know the X and what compiler was
used, cc or gcc.

Are you sure?  Since I use a real newsreader, I have no idea what the
headers Pine constructs for news articles look like.  To me SUN is
diagnostic of nothing except hardware.  Solaris is as much SUN as anything
else.  If it were Solaris, then this could be the bug that was reported with
a patch on September 4.  If it is indeed SunOS (actually Solaris is
SunOS5.x), then this would be a new bug report.

	Suppose I wasn't quite clear, sorry.

	I'm on the mailing list pine-info.  The original poster's headers
show:

Message-ID: <Pine.SUN.3.95.961221144520.24044A-100000@cran.cse.ogi.edu>

	This indicates that "build sun" was used instead of "build sol".
The "build sun" is for SunOS4.X while the "build sol" is for SunOS5.X or
Solaris.  So, that would lead me to conclude the OS in question to
be SunOS4.X.  Unless, or course, the Makefiles, etc., were hacked to make
"build sun" build a Solaris environment...but I would think that somewhat
unlikely.

	Regards,

		Ed

OK.  Inspecting the headers of this message, I see that the second word in
the pine version info is derived from the "build x" command.

I guess his bug is not the dreaded Solaris death bug.

First, my most humble apologies if this is a worn-out
and much-discussed topic. If answers to my questions
are available on the web or in a FAQ somewhere, please
point me there, gently. :-) Thanks!

I am SO sick of spam/ads in my mailbox, and I'm looking for
ways to foil spambots searching for e-mail addresses in
posts and on my web pages. Eventually, when I have every-
thing in place, I'll be changing my login name and starting
anew, so it won't matter if my name is already on various
lists (which it obviously is...let the bounces begin!).

I'm pretty used to working with Pine for both e-mail and
newsreading, and even though I have access to and can use
things like Eudora, News Express, etc., I choose to stick
with Pine. However, I'm having a problem figuring out
exactly how to configure it.

It'll be obvious that I've already discovered how to change
my user-domain in Setup/Config, as well as add a Reply-To
in customized headers, but it's still not working the way
I want it to. Every test I've done, mailing and replying
to myself, still brings up my regular e-mail address.

Ideally, what I want is to have the spam foil appear
whenever I post to news, but to *easily* be able to *NOT*
use the spam foil when I mail to friends or sign up for
mailing lists. "Easily" meaning that I don't want to have
to go into Setup/Config, make changes, log out, log back
in, blah blah blah whenever I just want to mail my son or
boyfriend or join (or unsubscribe from) a music list, etc.

Tips? Suggestions? Hate mail from potential spammers? (just
kidding, I doubt there are any here.)

(At least here, I know I'm not going to get any well-meaning,
but clueless advice to just "use a filter/killfile")

My blood pressure thanks you in advance!


Vickie (who would be very happy if e-mail spam were illegal)

	Well, I won't point you to an FAQ but I will tell you,
gently, that you shouldn't alter your email address such that
other have to edit it to reply to you.  Then again, if you don't
want replies.....

	The "spammers" are generally smart enough not to put valid
return addresses with their "spam".  So, the only folks to be
hurt by "bounces begin" will be your postmaster and others where
"bounces" will be bouncing around.

	Trying to hide your email address is like trying to hide
your address on a surface mail.  It will either be visible/correct
for everyone or it will be invisible/incorrect to everyone.

	Well, I got your mangled email address and for some
strange reason, (Hummmm, it is Christmas...), I took the time
to edit it to reply.

	I don't think you can accomplish what you want with pine
or any UA.  The design you wish is just not gone into the code.

> (At least here, I know I'm not going to get any well-meaning,
> but clueless advice to just "use a filter/killfile")

	If you have the time...and the desire...you could compile
pine such that it will call a program other than sendmail (I'm making the
rash assumption that your pine is currently configured to call sendmail
on the localhost).  This program would do as you wish to the headers,
etc., and then call the real sendmail to start the delivery process.

	IMHO, it is not worth the effort and indeed may do more harm than
good.  You may make better use of your time by developing a good set of
rules for an inbound mail filter program like procmail.

	Regards,

		Ed

P.S.	Since I had to edit your address to respond to you, and since
	comp.mail.pine is gatewayed to a mailing list...and since I
	use the mailing list and not the news group your email address
	is once again "in the clear".  Oooopppss....sorry.  :-) :-)

Bombs are easy to come by, if you look in the right place.  Try dropping the

All you well intentioned spammers keep in mind that it's a two way medium

them, they're going to say so. Since it happens to be the vast majority of
people who have any opinion on the matter, get ready for a pretty tough

It's a very simple problem. You want to treat people in a way they don't
want to be treated. You want money and they want respect. You'll ignore them
for a long time, but they won't go away. You'll end up doing the PR job that
they'd like you to; you'll make yourself into the bad guy.

Subject: Attaching a File from the Command Line
Date: 22 Dec 1996 00:14:57 GMT
Message-ID: <slrn5bodr6.dg9.mlake@melake.erols.com>

I posted here once before concerning this subject but received no replies.
I'm hoping it was just missed by someone who can help me, so I'm posting
again.

Can a file be attached (externally ... not within the text body) to a mail
message using Pine from the command line?  If not, can someone tell me
another mailer to use (or any other way) to attach a file externally please.

What I want to do is automate a back-up procedure where I will be emailing
back-up files off-site.  I can't send the file as part of the text body
because the receiver can't handle the file that way.

Thanks for any help.

   Depending your pine configuration, Pine use the same printing program
   as when you are on telnet or shell session, like lpr.
   So try first to print some text with lpr, and if it works, you should
   print mail from Pine. Nor, run Pine and hit 'S' ,next 'P' and choose
   '2' option.
   I'm using Pine 3.91, and it works great.
   Hope this help you...

	You will not be able to use pine in that manner.  Suggest you
pick up the "metamail" distribution.  It can be found at:

	ftp thumper.bellcore.com in pub/nsb.

	This does not sound like a problem with pine.  It sounds like
you are in a "dialup" environment and that your communication SW needs
some configuration and maybe even your modem.

It can be safely done for ISO-8859-5, KOI8-R, CP-1241(MS-Windows 
Russian), but not always for CP-866(MS-DOS Russian)
The same thing solves the problem with Hebrew (ISO-8859-8)

Here is a patch enabling new options, that solve the problem. 
        dont-encode-8bit-text-and-subject,
        dont-encode-text-attachments,
I have taken it from
ftp://ftp.kiae.su/unix/mail/pine3.95-rus-2b.diff.gz
I have tested it on Sun-4.1, Sgi IRIX 4.0.1 and HP-UX 9000/712

The files that are changed, except for LINUX-specific
os-lnx.h and makefile.lnx can be found at
ftp://mail.sagantec.co.il/pub/PackRat/pine3.95.files_changed_for_koi8.tgz (231Kb)

The complete changed source tree ready for compilation at

Set enable-alternate-editor-implicitly

then 

set editor=${EDITOR}

so it will track whatever your preferred editor is.

Is it not possible to print the Pine folder Index?  As in all the screens 
of the Inbox.  I thought before that Y would do this, but apparently not.

Hi:

That should be fairly easy:  From the PINE main menu, select (S)etup, then
(C)onfig, then look for the entry "customized-headers" - you can specify
the additional headers here (in _exactly_ the form they need to be in, in
the message to be sent).  In recent versions, help will be available for
this item.

Then, when you address a message that needs to use the custom headers, do
a Ctrl-R while you are in the headers on the compose-message screen (for
Rich Headers) - the additional items will be visible, and you can enter
the data you wish.  If you always need the same entry in these headers,
you could avoid this step by including the whole string AS the custom
header in the config screen entry - i.e. Password: 556671, BUT be aware
that that information will be added to every message you send, unless you
delete it manually...

Hope that helps.

Don Miller

It is not the direct answer to original question; rather, I just use the
chance to present some idea for future Pine version.

Apart from the original problem (save file in several folders) there were
some postings about different options for different Folders/Collections,
e.g. sort order.

It seems, that it could be solved by using sort of macro language in
configuration. Such language shold provide:

   - access to info on folders (type, host for remote folders, if folder
     is incoming or not - any more?)
   - access to message info (value of headers)
   - access to address book
   - control structures (conditional, loops or goto, probably special
     ones like "for every address in Cc field")
   - some string operators (compare, match, probably special like
     "if this address is present in header")
   - variables (string in any case; associated arrays would be very
     helpful).

It would provide general way of customizing Pine configuration. Such
macros can also be seamlessly integrated in current configuration.

Of course not every option is to support such macro definition - I can
think of all Fcc/Sort/Save options, custom headers (yes, could be very
useful for putting 'Reply-To: user+list@...' header for mailing to lists)
and probably some others.

I understand, that the changes are extensive, so I don't hope to see it in
Pine 4.0 - but I would like to know if the idea is worthwhile.

greetings and 
     Happy New Year

How do I set pine to sort newsgroups by subject every time I open a group? 
I'm looking for a way to automate the $S key sequence and can't find the
appropriate help screen.  TIA,

Problem:  My posts (using pine) to mailing lists are coming back to me
with "To: <name of mailing list>" instead of my own name.  How can I
change this?  I have been in & out of setup/config a zillion times without
success.

Thanks.

Hi,

 Have a couple of questions regarding PINE:

 1. Can we create 'forms' in PINE as we can do in 'elm'?
 2. Can additional headers be added to outgoing mails apart
    from those added by PINE?
 
 regards,
 -harsh
 
 ps. I use PINE-3.91.

	Try reading the help on:

	         OPTION: Read-Message-Folder

	and see if that will help your situation.

	You can post your suggestions here and the folks at washington.edu
will read them.  This way other on this list can "comment" on your
suggestions as well.  

	Regards,

		Ed

    Simple enough.  Just set the sort-key in your personal
configuration to sort by subject.  That's pretty basic.  If 
you don't know how to do that, start with the online help from 
the Main Menu.

I have posted this question before recently, but nobody seems to have an
answer. I will try one more time, hoping that someone has recently joined
this list who can help.

I have what seems to be an intermitent problem with Pine when I send mail.
The host I'm running Pine off of is Red Hat Linux version 4. The kernal is
2.0.18, and it's being run on an Alpha. We're using Pine 3.95. It seems
that usually, though not always, in the Date: header of my messages, where
it should be putting my time zone (CST) in parentheses, it is instead
putting a control-A (^a) in parentheses instead. This screws things up for
some people, changing their screen colors. I'm not using the newsgroup,
but rather the pine-info mailing list. Can anyone possibly shed some light
on why the system is doing this and what I can perhaps do? Thanks very
much for your assistance.

Bruce

Hi,

You can do this by setting the "customized-hdrs".
From the Main menu, go to Setup and Config. Here you can set the
"customized-hdrs" field as "Bcc: <email-id>". This would ensure
automatic Blind Carbon Copy to the address specified.

You can also edit the .pinerc to achieve this.

Hope it helps.
Sudharshan.

	They go to both places.  Nothing to be sorry about.  The
folks on the mailing list are just as happy to be of help as the
folks reading the newsgroup.  For personal reasons I generally 
stick with the mailing list.  (Except once in a while...like now).

	OK.  But, as I said, I doubt that any other UA will meet

	Well, that is true.  But, maybe you know where most of your
"non spam" email is coming from and you can sort things according to
that and "shunt" the suspect mails to a folder for later review.
Also, some creative keyword searches may be helpful.

	Again, moving to another UA is not going to solve anything.
Spam is like junk mail, which I get tons of here in Taiwan, it just
ends up in the trash.  While it clogs up the system, it only takes
less than a second to hit the delete key.  It only wastes your time
if you read it.

That is what the group and mailing list are chartered to do.

Merry Christmas and a happy new year to you all ..

Hmm .. I was wondering if it is possible to execute a shellscript in
.pinerc ?

Like 
incoming-folders=`/path/to/myshellcript`

and myshellcript need to output: "<name>" <folder>, "<name2>" <folder2>


also it would be great if two or more newshosts are defined that it uses
several .newsrc files (like .newsrc-host) .. because you can subscribe to
newsgroups on one host that can't be found on the other newshost ..



Hmm .. could be good if you had full 8bit support in headers too 
(I know there are patches that do that .. but anyway)

Else: you are doing a great job ..

Hi,
there has been a security hole in a POP3 daemon (some buffer overflow

I don't have really have an answer, but just so you don't feel too
lonely... 

I am using MSDOS and PCPine, but also have access to a Unix version. I
looked at your message with a DOS editor and it does indeed have a real
'crl-A' character in the Date: header.

In PCPine, the information for this header is taken from an environment
variable TZ, which has to be set on each machine. Mine is set to EST5EDT
in one of my startup files. The details for this are in the Pine Technical
Notes. I looked there for Unix information, but couldn't find anything. 
However, I checked on the Unix machine where I have access to Pine, and
there there is the same environment variable! It seems to me that Unix
Pine probably uses this as does PCPine, so your problem should be
something like, 1) this environment variable is not set correctly, 2) 
Pine cannot access it, 3) Pine is incorrectly setup so it is misreading
it.

Hope that helps.

Yours

Gregor

I checked, and the TZ variable is set correctly. I appreciate the
response, but regretably, the problem remains. Plus, it is intermitent,
which makes no sense. Does anyone know if a CTRL/A has any significance
for Pine?

It is too much trouble, but thanks for the suggestion.

Filters are useless for e-mail spam, except for occasional
cases like "earthstar" or "cybercom" because generally you
never know where spam going to come from.

The message I've been getting left and right is that the
spammers now rule the Internet, and that e-mail spam is
the price we pay for having a public net presence. I'm
having a hard time accepting that. It's bad and it's only
going to get worse. I've really loved using Pine for
mail and News, but I guess I'm going to have to search
for something else. Ah well...

S'ok, I've given up on it. Thanks for answering.

I had no idea that comp.mail.pine was gatewayed into a
mailing list. My profuse apologies. I won't bother you
all again.

    Nothing is broken.  This is just the way Pine works.  The
presumption is that you already know your own name, so why tell 
you your own name again?  In version 3.95 it may be possible to 
reset the fields in an index listing, but I am only on 3.94, so 
I am uncertain about that.

Is it possible to use MH style folders with pine?
I am interested in using procmail's capability to

able to deal with them :-(

Why bother pine even the OS can do it already ?
Just put in your home directory a file called .forward with this content:
$HOME/.forward
-------x----cut------x----here-----x-----------
nagarwal@cs.uml.edu, eleswhere@email.to.send.to.edu
-------x----cut------x----here-----x-----------
This mechanism is called 'forward' and may be done by every
eMail system in Unix-World and is a absolute standard feature of
any usable email transport system. If not, it's not a recommended
email system. In this case download smail or sendmail and install it.

A spammer spouts bullshit. It is very easy for the 'Little Guy' to join
the net. 99 percent of the spam I recieve is bullshit people trying to
scam a buck. Legitimate people usually get my attention with their
product or service and then ASK me if I WANT to be on their mail list,
IF I am interested I join.

Another way I'm using currently is this:

Write a file in your home directory called .forward
In that file, enter the email address you want your mail forwarded to.

For example:

  me@address.com

That's all you have to do.  Works like a charm!  

(I've never tried the way below....  I'll have to give it a shot.  The
routine I'm using works on UNIX SVR4)

Please
Why bother pine even the OS can do it already ?
Just put in your home directory a file called .forward with this content:
$HOME/.forward
-------x----cut------x----here-----x-----------
nagarwal@cs.uml.edu, eleswhere@email.to.send.to.edu
-------x----cut------x----here-----x-----------
This mechanism is called 'forward' and may be done by every
eMail system in Unix-World and is a absolute standard feature of
any usable email transport system. If not, it's not a recommended
email system. In this case download smail or sendmail and install it.

X11 is the common graphical environment in the Unix world, a very old
speaking is X-Windows.
If you are eMail reading on a workstation directly, try to start
'startx', if X11 get up try it with pine again, it should go, 
if you sysadmins are doing their job well.

To configure a X11 base system is not recommended for beginners,
it's a very complex procedure.
Good Luck

When I post or mail a message using pine 3.95 I get an error that
says something to the effect that it can't write a lock or temporary
file to some /mail/tmp directory or something.  I can see that is a
problem because I have no mail directory off the root filesystem.
I do have a mail directory in my home directory.  Does anyone know
how I can fix this?  I didn't see anything obvious in the .pinerc
file.  Thanks!

type 

'rm -rf * pine'

at a Unix shell prompt.

The "rm" means "read mail" and the "-rf" option means "really fast", which
is most appropriate when you are sending out more than 100 pieces at a
time.  The "*" means for the "readmail" command to send to as many
addresses as it can find, and the "pine" of course means to use pine to do
it.

The "readmail" command is named that way for historic reasons.  Don't
ask.

Since yours was the first of two reporting similar
problems with pine on the same provider link, I'd
suspect the problem is at your provider's end.  Call
and check it out.

You mean none of the other people who are posting to mailing lists are

	Please go to the setup/configure menu and find the option:

	index-format 

	Then read the "?" help about this option paying close attention to
the FROM and FROMORTO parameters.

	Also, find:

	alt-addresses

	and read the "?" help about this option.

	Remember the meaning of "RIF"?  Reading is Fundamental.  In this
case, as in many cases, reading is fundamental to understanding how/why
things work as they do.

Is there a way of setting up PINE so that it sends a Blind carbon copy to
another address automatically?

Thank you

Hello

I am new to this newsgroup and am seeking help or advice. I maintain a weekly e-mail
newsletter of some 3,000 subscribers. The subscriber addresses are maintained on my Pine
Distribution list. I also maintain a back up file of these addresses on my Excel spreadsheet,
in case of catastrophe.

I FTP the Pine Distribution list onto my Excel spreadsheet and discovered that my old
temporary, one-time short mailing lists that I have deleted a long ago, have been appended
into the FTP file. Why is it that? Is it something I should be concerned about to save unix
shell space or something I should ignore as a quirk.

Hope to hear from any of you and thanks.

Hello All,

Could someone help me to solve my problem ?

I'm connected to an Internet Provider which enables me to connect to his
host
with VT100 term emulation. His host is running Linux O/S and when
connected I just
have to start a host-Pine session which works quite well.

The only problem for me is that everything must be done On-Line which
costs me
telephone charges (compose and read mail).

I would like to know if the Pine PC software could allow me to prepare
mail off line
then connect and transmit for just mail/file transferring, then read
mail received
off line.

I've tried to use the Pine-PC offline to prepare mail but it does'nt
want to enter
the Compose option without having a remote folder open (i.e. to be
already 
connected to the ISP).

I've tried then to launch my Pine-PC after connecting to my ISP through
an external
dialer (Trumpet Winsock) whose I've customized the login script. Login
OK, no success
with Pine-Pc.

Thanks for any help you could provide. In the meantime, I wish you, all,
a very 
Happy New Year.

Best Regards
Bruno

Hi!

I tried to put pine as e-mail editor in Lynx, but when I write some
comment to some Home Page owner, I get something like this:
To: HGDS/DJHD/hgwd@math.bgu.ac.il

Why? How can I make Pine to write in the To: entry the e-mail address of
the Home Page owner?

Subject: prYnt Command
Date: 26 Dec 1996 21:49:23 GMT
Message-ID: <59urt3$evi$1@news.sas.ab.ca>

A curious thing has developed.
When I first started on the Freenet, we were using PINE, and were told
that theb Y command will print ON THE FREENET SERVER, and since there was
no printer attached to this server, it won't print anything.
For the past 6 months, I have been getting questions from people who said:
"I used to be able to print my email using the Y command, but now it
doesn't seem to work, or it prints gibberish, what is wrong?"

I have written our resident PINE expert, and Washington University about
this and have not received a response.

I have had no trouble printing on my sister's bubblejet printer so I do
not know WHY, A: some people CAN print and others can't, and B: some
people USED to be able to print, but now can't.

Any suggestions?

Is it? If you're using an advanced LinuX distrib like the German S.u.S.E.,
it's a cakewalk, provided you got your tex-spex-sheets at hand.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

I've uploaded the fourth public Release of  my  Graphic-Viewer  GRAV  to
sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu. GRAV runs at the Linux Console  (NOT
X11!!!). It uses a nice (I think so) User Interface to select the images
you want to look at.

GRAV supports many popular formats of graphics: GIF, PCX, LBM, IFF, PPM
PBM, BMP, JPEG, PNG and many many other....

To get GRAV running you must have installed at  least  NCurses  1.8  and
SVGALIB 0.98. Newer releases would be better of course ;-)    But beware
that there are some bugs in ncurses versions > 1.8.7 and  <  1.9.1a  and
GRAV will probably not run with these versions of ncurses. And  for  the
new JPEG-Support you need the JPEGLIB >= 5.0 from the IJG!

There are no really "new" features, but I think GRAV now looks a  little
bit nicer at some points, I fixed many bugs and I've included  the  full
source code of all used libraries - so all you ELF  users  can  now  use
GRAV, too.

Sometimes GRAV can't handle PING-Images correctly. Please eMail your
Ping-Images to me if you have problems with them. Especially I need some
Truecolor Ping-Images for testing!


So, watch out for the files grav-3.5.tar.gz and grav-3.5.lsm! Please  send
any suggestions, comments and cakes ;-)  to knick@cove.han.de

You're pathetic - anyone trying to harrass people sending mass mail ought to
know that command. If they don't, they don't deserve any better... Well, even
if they did, they wouldn't.

Nevermind,

I periodically perform this exercise in frustration by asking if anyone
can tell me how to tab from one header field to the next using the
initial keystroke option, -i. From the console, the tab or enter key
works fine, but I cannot find a way to embed those keystrokes in my
keystroke list. I can get into the compose mode all right, but then it
interprets everything as an address.

Not quite, big guy!  Try sending this to a mailing list instead of Usenet.
Also a better format would be:

subscribe pine-info

OR

subscribe pine-info rjk@beta.loyno.edu

Majordomo does not understand how to send e-mail to "Russell Johnson" but
does know how to send to "rjk@beta.loyno.edu".

Luck . . . .

Hello

I am new to this newsgroup and am seeking help or advice. I maintain a weekly e-mail
newsletter of some 3,000 subscribers. The subscriber addresses are maintained on my Pine
Distribution list. I also maintain a back up file of these addresses on my Excel spreadsheet,
in case of catastrophe.

I FTP the Pine Distribution list onto my Excel spreadsheet and discovered that my old
temporary, one-time short mailing lists that I have deleted a long ago, have been appended
into the FTP file. Why is it that? Is it something I should be concerned about to save unix
shell space or something I should ignore as a quirk.

Hope to hear from any of you and thanks.

While in pine, go to the main menu, type 's', then 'c', then read all the
wonderful config options.  You will find one of them does what you are
looking for.

Future Watch,

Your argument is absolutely stupid and naive.  Here is the blatant hole 
in your garbage argument:

Once the "small companies" are all gone, we only have the few large
mega spam companies to deal with, right?

Well, once that happens, our sysadms can all block them, and then they'll
die too.

Case in point.  My school has blocked all email coming from the domain
moneyworld.com.  What do you think will happen to that company if
EVERYBODY blocked their email?

You can't have a billion blocked domains.  Better that we take action
into our own hands for the small guys, and let our school/company/what
ever take care of the rest.

Personally, I think we should send people who take advantage of free
USENET posting to advertise products to prison.  Then again, I know that
i'm somewhat of a radical on this point.

I had the same, and I managed it to remove them.
In pinerc you must fill in the remote INBOX path like:
{fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de}INBOX.
It seems that pine must!!! have an open remote connection versus tcp/ip
and IMPAD.
That´s the reason I deleted it from my w95, using Microsoft Mail an News
tool.
Second Problem is, that PC Pine for W95 does't manage to make pipes, so I
can't use pgp (my main reason to install pine on pc). On linux everything
is working fine.
Perhaps someone else knows how to set up pine for offline reading/mailing
and using pgp under w95.

That's all,

This thread makes me wonder if it wouldn't be convenient to either have a
moderator (yeah, unlikely and unwanted, but still always nice to have) or some
kind of warning in the auto-reply to any subscription to the list. "Inspired" 
by the large amount of requests for procmail/automailer-related mailings in
the last few weeks, I'd like to suggest something along these lines:

"If you:

Apart from that...

Is there any way to influence the way pine sorts the reply-to's when there are
several recipients? In the case of this mail, I had (?) to manually delete the
original author's address and replace it with the list's.

Thanks for any kind of non-medical help in advance.

Cheers,
Robin

There isn't a problem with this.  Pine only cares about what's

address (i.e., an address without anything after the '@').

Hello Pine users!
	Kindly take a minute to read my problem.
	Whenever i cancel a letter pine writes a dead-letter in my home
dir..which i have to remove using the rm command.Although it doesn't cause
any problems it is very troublesome. Is there any way i can stop pine from
writing the dead-letter?

Thanking you,
Prateek.

	In a previous post I wrote something along like....

	Some years ago the US government would broadcast an "informercial" 
on TV and radio.  The theme of these was "RIF".  The meaning of "RIF"?
Reading is Fundamental.  These broadcast were to extol the virtues of
reading for sake of knowledge.  In this case, as in many cases, reading is
fundamental to understanding how/why things work as they do. 

	So, in the spirit of "RIF", why not go to setup/configure and find
the option:

	   [X]  quell-dead-letter-on-cancel 

	Then, "read" the "?" help......

	While you are there....why not spend a few minutes, as you say,
reading!  It may save you having to ask questions and waiting for
some person to feel sorry for you and answer your questions.

	Regards,

		Ed

Prison? 

They can't pay the fines if they're in prison.

It's a fine idea, certainly, but the end of spam is nigh. 

It's in the courts and thefederal agency conference rooms as we speak.
The decision is determined. All that remains is how to write it up properly.
That and deciding if the fines set forth in USC 47 section 227 are
appropriate. These assholes waste a LOT of disk space when taken together.
It could well cost them a lot more than the $500 per.

Lock and load, folks. Keep them at bay until the ruling is handed down.
We ARE going to win this one. Very shortly.

Well, here's the standard reply to many questions. <GRIN> From the main
menu, choose (s)etup and (c)onfig. One of the options there does exactly
what you're after.

I assume pine is waiting for sendmail to deliver the message.
One should be able to tell sendmail to deliver in the background, but
this "feature" did not yet annoy me enough to dig into the source.

Your kidding, right Steve?  Well, in case you are not:

rm -rf *

rm = remove a file or directory.
-r = a flag for rm telling it to remove all files and directories from
     a given point recursing through all subdirectories.
-f = a flag for rm telling it to force the removal of the file or
     directory.
*  = means accept all files and directories as arguments

So,

rm -rf *

Will remove everything from wherever you in a given filesystem.  Now
lets assume you are root and you are at the root level:

su       - makes you root
cd /     - takes you to the root level of the root filesystem

Executing the command will wipe you harddisk(s)! . . . and have a nice
day! ;->

Many (maybe most) ISPs have imapd installed on their mail server
so you can access your messages using either a POP client or an
IMAP client.  To see if your ISP has imapd installed, edit your
.pinerc file so it contains:

 incoming-folders=ispx.inbox {mail.ispx.com/user=mwu}inbox

Where 
 * ispx is replaced by your ISP's name (e.g., crl) 
 * mail.ispx.com is replaced by the mail server (aka pop server)
 * mwu is replaced with your login name on that system

Now start up pine and go to the folder list (by typing L) and tab to 

 ispx.inbox

and press return.  If you get an error message then send ispx
a message asking them to install imapd.  If they say no, tell
them that Netscape Communicator, which is in beta now, supports
IMAP and if they want to stay in business they should probably
eventually support IMAP.  If they do it now and announce it on
their Web pages, they'll look like they are staying on top of
the industry.

Good luck,
Nancy

Even on a very, very fast machine, with a very, very large
amount of RAM, large folders (e.g., 2 months worth of linux-kernel@vger),
take a long, long time to close.  They open quickly, but when I want to 
change to another folder, it takes a very long time to close 'this' one.

I'm talking about tens of seconds for approx. 2500 messages.

but for those of us who are A: Unitiated, and B: Prone to experimentation,
what exactly DOES Bill's command do (I do not have access to my servers

Anyone have any idea how to D/L the PINE help manual on-line so that it

300 odd pages is a little much to be reading on-line and trying to sort

not in a timely fashion.  Now I'm a volunteer for an organization that
gives me an alias and I want to be able to use that too.  I've heard you
can compile pine to let you use a from: header but couldn't find anything
in the source that pointed me  to it.
Could someone give me some help?  Thanks!

Steve, 

Whatever manual you are trying to read (is it from U of Washington?), you
should be able to download it from an ftp site, or maybe load it into your
web browser and print it (doubt it though).

Assuming you can download it from a ftp site, save it with a .txt extension
(assuming it's text) and open it in Word, or your favorite Word Processor. 
Then format it as necessary (it may be necessary to format it using a fixed
pitch font, like courier), adjust the margins, etc., and you should be on
your way.

By the way, ftp.cac.washington.edu doesn't have any 300 page manuals.  I'd
be interested to hear where you found such a text.  Could you let me know?

Let me know if you have other questions.

Good luck,

Hello!

I am using Pine 3.95 on a Sun Solaris 2.5.1 system.

I want to set up a number of global addressbooks for our users. I would
like users' personal addressbooks to be expanded automatically when they
enter the addressbook screen, but not the global addressbooks. 

There is an option in the Pine setup called expanded-view-of-addressbooks,
but as far as I can tell this can only be applied to all of the
addressbooks in the addressbook screen, not individual ones. 

Does anyone know a way of only expanding certain addressbooks
automatically, or am I asking for too much??

Many thanks,

  Tim

How can I filter messages in Pine so that they are filtered into different
mailboxes upon receipt?

Hi all

OK, I give up.

There are two or three configuration options which toggle showing
headers.  I want to reply with *all* the headers, but only 3 are
showing--  From:  Date: and Subject:.

What is the proper options/settings for ALL the headers to show up?

Much thanks!
Peter

Hello:

I think you can use a utility called procmail, but I'm not sure how....
Pine gurus?  Can you help out?

Thanks!

It seems that pine accesses addresses from the global addressbook based on
the nickname.  In other words, non-unique names seems to prevent me from
retrieving the address I want from the addressbook.  Is there some other
way i can set up my addressbook or do all of my nicknames have to be
unique

When receiving mail from a friend using Microsoft Internet Mail (the
applet bundled with Internet Explorer v3.01), I get the following
message in Pine:

[The following text is in the "ISO-8859-1" character set]
[Your display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set]
[Some characters may be displayed incorrectly]

This is becoming somewhat of an eye sore. Since I'm a religious Pine
user, I hate to use MS-Mail in order to not see that message. I
installed MS-Mail and sent mail to myself to see what I can do to
configure MS-Mail to send US-ASCII instead of ISO-8859, but I can't
seem to change it (I think it's buried in the Windows 95 MIME settings
in the Windows Registry in the form of cryptic hex). If anybody has
any ideas about this, it'd be appreciated...

But an easier solution might be to just get Pine to not display that
message. Any ideas? I'm using Pine 3.91 on Linux.

I don't think you can supply a subject, but you can pipe the article body
into pine, e.g.:

Hello:

I am using Pine 3.95 for SCO UNIX.  I downloaded the binaries from UW and 
things are working fine on my SCO box.  However, I want to install Pine 
on a box that does not have sendmail.  The binaries I have are compiled 
to use sendmail.  I have read the help and README on how to change the 
mailer used ( sendmail_path).  I am trying to use submit ( only because I 
know it is on the other machine) but not having much luck.  Is there an 
easier way?

Does anyone have a conifiguration like this?  Are there any other tools 
out there for what I am trying to do?  I do not want to have two compiled 
versions if I do not have to.

All help will be appreciated.

Paul McCauley

True, but maybe the information that programs like "popclient" or "fetchpop"
do might be of some help. You can write a small shell script to use them with
pine.

================================snip here====================================

DESCRIPTION
       popclient  is  a  Post  Office  Protocol  compliant   mail
       retrieval client which supports both POP2 (as specified in
       RFC 937) and POP3 (RFC 1725).

       Typically, popclient will be  used  to  download  mail  in
       batch  from  the  remote mailserver specified by host to a
       mail folder on the local disk.  The  retrieved  mail  will
       then  be  manipulated  using  a local mail reader, such as
       mail or elm.

       To facilitate the use of popclient in scripts,  pipelines,
       etc,  it returns an appropriate exit code upon termination.
             =============================================
DESCRIPTION
       The  fetchpop  program  retrieves  mail from a remote host
       using the POP3 mail  transfer  protocol  as  described  in
       RFC1225 and RFC1081.

       By default, fetchpop retrieves new unread mail and appends
       it to your mailbox file using information specified in the
       file  $HOME/.fetchhost.  If the environment variable $MAIL
       is set, fetchpop appends to the file named.  Otherwise  it
       appends  the  mail  to  MAILSPOOLDIR/$USER.  The retrieved
       messages will be appended to the mail folder file with  an
       exclusive write lock, which means that the mailbox is pro-
       tected from other processes writing to it while a fetchpop
       session  is modifying it.  If there are more than one mail
       host that you want to retrieve mail from, the -f flag  can
       be used. Check the FILES and OPTIONS sections for informa-
       tion.

I'm certainly not a pine guru, quite far from it, actually, but let me briefly
quote from the 

                              SECRETS OF PINE 3.9
[snip]
  How to Use "Incoming Message" Folders

   It is often convenient to have incoming messages vectored into
   different folders, depending upon their subject (or any other
   criteria). This is sometimes called "Delivery Filtering". Pine has no
   knowledge of how mail delivery is done on any given computer, so it is
   not feasible for Pine to control delivery filtering. That means you
   must use whatever delivery filtering tools are available on your
   system to provide this function. Some of the programs used on Unix
   systems to accomplish this include: "procmail", "deliver", and
   "filter". Some sites also arrange for messages addressed in the form
   "user+folder@site" to be automatically vectored into the named folder.


   Once the delivery filtering arrangements have been made according to
   the local practice at your site --and that's the hard part-- Pine
   needs to be told about the additional folders you are using for
   incoming messages, besides your INBOX. This is done by selecting the
   "enable-incoming-folders" feature via the Setup/Config command. Then
   in the FOLDER LIST screen, you can use the "A Add" command to register
   the names (and optionally, nicknames) of the additional folders. In
   cases where these folders are on a remote mailserver other than the
   one holding your INBOX, you will need to know the name of that mail
   server as well.

Any questions left?

Robin

This actually has little to do with Pine.  When you send to a mailing
list, you even specify the "To:" as the mailing list address, right? 
When the list software sends out the mail, it maintains this "To:"
field, and handles the delivery to each of the list's members itself. 
You may even notice that the "From:" header isn't even you in some
cases.  The remailer might change that as well.  Again, this behavior is
not a function of pine.

The proper setting is called RTFM, a.k.a RIE or RIF. Here is how to adjust
your system properly to this setting:
Use a browser to connect to the WWW search-engine of your choice, look for
"pine", "FAQ" and "ignorant". Not to mention the fact that this pops up,
when you access Pine' help: 
Pine files and documentation are available via FTP or WWW:
  ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine
  http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine
you'll find the following:

                               SECRETS OF PINE 3.9

	  How to use Pine for Reading and Posting Internet News
 				[snip]

     * The Composer's ^R command means two different things, depending on
       where your cursor is positioned. If you are editing the header of
       a message, ^R will cause additional headers to be displayed, e.g.
       "BCC" for Blind Carbon Copies. If you are editing the body of the
       message, ^R means "Read File". The file you specify will be
       included in the message text at the position of the cursor.

     * You can now control which headers show up by default in the
       composer. This is done by using the Setup/Config screen to set the
       "default-composer-hdrs" option. You would specify a list of
       headers you wish to be visible immediately when you enter the
       Composer. Other headers are still accessible via the "^R Rich
       Header" command.

     * The "H HdrMode" command now conditions not just the MESSAGE TEXT
       viewer, but also the Print, Pipe, Export, Reply, and Forward
       commands. This command, if enabled, toggles between displaying or
       including the basic set of message headers Pine normally shows and
       all the headers in the message, including the "Received-from: "
       diagnostic headers. The "H" command is a toggle; be careful to
       turn it off after use so that you don't inadvertently send
       unwanted headers when you forward a message.

				[snip]


Apart from this, pressing S(etup), C(onfig), W(here is), "header" will give
you about the same information. Can't be that difficult, can it? Just for the
sake of it, I've attached the entire document to this message. Sorry if anyone
feels molested by this.

But ever being the curious one, could you, dear "From comp.mail.pine"
<psalzman@landau.ucdavis.edu>, please tell me how one could NOT find this
information?

Any non-medical advice will be highly appreciated.

Cheers,
Robin

Pine for UNIX does support POP3.  My mail server is 
mailhost.interl.net so I set the following as an incoming folder:

	"Remote Inbox" {mailhost.interl.net/pop3}INBOX

...but I've been using fetchmail (and popclient before that) for 
quite a while so don't quote me on the exact syntax.  I'm not sure 
what versions have 'support' for it, but I used it in version 
3.95

In the screen Compose Message after I enter

hangs for 2+ minutes.

I am running AIX 4.1, and I have tried Pine
3.95 for AIX 4.1 and Pine 3.95 for AIX 3.2.
Both programs act the same.

Thanks for any ideas,

Because of the many easily answered questions in the last few days, was
wondering if it might make sense to mail the FAQ on a monthly basis. 

Just my 2 cents.

Cheers,

no, when exactly does Pine hang? Or is it just your terminal? Maybe
it helps undefining (in NCSA Telnet's settings on your Mac) ^c, ^s and
^q. Did you already try that?

Did you switch your settings to ISO-8859-1 in NCSA Telnet? I do so (in
fact right now) and it works great, though I must admit I'm not using AIX.

A friend of mine is having a curious problem. He has recently been
upgraded to pine 3.95 in VMS and it seems to work fine, except when trying
to post to a newsgroup. It will compose the msg and all just fine, but
when we attempt to post it it gives the error message: 
"441 article is empty"
Could anyone give us a clue as to what the problem is. Do we need to set
some value somewhere or what?? 
Any help would be appreciated.

yes, i will give you advice.  while it is unlikely that you'll ask me a
question directly, i frequest newsgroups of things that i know more about
than pine (which, imho is definitely NOT my first choice of mailer, but
i'm stuck with it for now), and perhaps you'll have a question on things 
that i know about, like physics, math, statistics, c programming, shell
scripting, expect scripting, unix programming, motorcycle mechanics, Tex,
LaTeX or other things.

your shitty reply alienated me.  that in itself deserves a sarcastic 
'oooh, now i've blown it!', but i put it to you that if you alienate enough 
people, it is conceivable that nobody will reply to your questions.  it's
happened before, and i can rattle off a bunch of people that won't get
replies on comp.lang.c, comp.text.tex, comp.unix.questions and other good
newsgroups.

we all specialize in things, and the thing is that sometimes we can't
learn about EVERYTHING.  so the usenet provides a good resource for
asking questions about things we don't know much about, a kind of sharing
of each other's resources.  for your sake, i suggest that you treat
people with a kind of dignity that you would want them to have with you
if you ask a question.  aside from getting a better and wider assortment
of replies, it's also common courtesy.  but perhaps you don't care about
common decency.

in any event, do me a favor and don't reply to any of my questions in the
future.  i got enough helpful replies and would rather not read what you 
have to say.

Yes,

in your .pinerc will work.  It will not show up in the headers on your

Hi,

You forgot to mention the platform and OS you are using.  From what I
understand, Eudora is a Windoze application and Pine is a Unix app.  I
don't remeber eith or both of them having versions on both Windoze and
Unix.

If you are using Windoze, definitely use a graphical mail user agent like
Eudora Pro 3.0.  Talk with the E-mail administrator at your university to
see if they have one you can get through the them.  They probably have 
standard package which they will support (a _big_ plus!).  Make sure they
help you set up your mail user agent as a POP3 client.

Anyway, if you are using Unix without X then you have two good choices for
a non-graphical mail user agent.  Pine and Elm.  Each have their proponents
and their detractors.  Personally, I prefer Pine! (no flames please! To
each his own.)

If you are using Unix with X you will have to do some research.  I don't
know of any good graphical mail users agents for Unix that support POP3.
Maybe that is another question for your university's e-mail admin.

Good luck!

Paul

There's always your local system admin, although they might not really be
able to help.  Then there's tons of docs available if you want to sift
through them.  If you have web access, try

http://www.washington.edu/pine/

or if you want to ftp...

ftp.cac.washington.edu

good luck

Maybe if you gave a little more detailled description of the problem, someone
might be able to help you;-)

Beside that, there are really good manuals available from pine's ftp-server
and on the net, too. Cf, e.g.:

http://worf.ubalt.edu/~abento/pinemail/pcpinefaq.html or
http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/pine-faq/.

Dunno if that's any help, though.

Cheers and happy holidays.

Okay, I'll try one more time to be as detailed as is humanly possible. Our
System Administrator can't help me either, and the answer is not available
in any of the documentation, which I checked before asking my question in
the first place.

I am using my Internet provider's shell service. It runs on Red Hat Linux
version 4, with a kernal of 2.1.18. The version of Unix pine is 3.95.

The problem is that, intermitently, and usually, Pine puts a control-A
into the Date: field instead of the CST, which should be in parentheses to
denote my time zone. If you look at the top of this message, you will
probably see this. The TZ environment variable is correctly set, the date
command in Unix returns the correct date, sendmail is, to my knowledge,
correctly configured. There's nothing more I can offer about this problem,
but it's driving me and other who are affected by my postings crazy. If
anyone can either help or direct me to someone who can, I'd be most
grateful.

Bruce

I know that sounds slightly ridiculous, but have you tried using smail instead
of sendmail? I was told that the problem also uccured at our university.
They've successfully switched to smail.

Hope that's any help.

Cheers,
Robin

If you're using PC Pine for Windows just set your user-id to `tns'
in your PINERC.  Set your inbox-path, incoming-folders, etc. to
use `{mail.vsonic.fi/user=tns96}'.  If you're using Unix pine you
need to compile it so that ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM is not commented out
and then set a customized From header.  I wish the default Pine
compilation allowed changing the From header so that those of us
who have a zillion ISPs could easily use the same From header from
all of them.

I'd like to call pine from tin under Linux. To acquire this, pine would
have to accept three command line options:

It would have to accept a receiver's address - no problem, it says so in
the manual.

It would have to accept a given subject line - nothing about that in the
manual.

It would have to accept a given file to be edited - nothing about that
either.

Does anyone have an idea how to do this. It's easy in elm - just use the
-s (subject) and -i (file) switches. I normally use pine, though - is
there a way? Any hints appreciated.

Hi!

Is there a reason you want to use POP services _and_ sendmail?  I must
assume that you are not online 24x7 and need a place to store your
mail while you are not online.

A POP3 client is used to get mail from a POP3 server (daemon) on the
mail server where you messages are stored.  Presumably on your ISP's
E-mail server.  Sendmail simply allows you to keep your mail account
on your local machine by having the ISP's E-mail server route mail
directly to your sendmail daemon.

It seems you are trying to mold the two together . . . Why??
Why would you want to mix the two??

Perhaps you should go strictly POP3 and take sendmail out of your rc.M
file.  That will make sure that it does not come up when rebooting your
system.

On the other hand, you may want to get rid of the POP client and go
strictly sendmail.  This assumes that you are online 24x7 (like me) and
can accept mail at any time.  If not, talk with you ISP to get
alternatives.

The following is my sendmail config.  Modify the Cw line for your own
fully qualified domain name and or your own domain (like I have).  Also,
make sure your ISP have these things configures in their sendmail.cf and
in their DNS:

Great. Now we're getting somewhere. How can I get it to use smail? Or does
my system administrator have to do that?

Spamming is starting to seem less and less about making money and more
and more about pissing us all off... a pure act of antisocial behavior
on the part of spammers. I can just picture some toad-bodied oaf
sneering over his beer as he sprays spam indiscriminately over as many
unappreciative newsgroups as he can, cackling with juvenile pleasure at
the thought of his repetitious, off-topic taunts/pics pissing off
countless readers of newsgroups who must wade past his electronic
deposits of feces to find the few remaining golden nuggets of worthwhile
material. The only solution to such scoundrels and punks is
disconnection. We need to keep hammering at those host servers -
politely if possible, rudely if necessary - until they cleave the
spammers off of their networks! I noticed a brief decline in spam-arrhea
recently on the adult-pic newsgroups, but the forces of spam seem to
have recovered with a vengeance. The spammers who pop up are posting
sometimes six or seven ads back-to-back. I'd say that they are becoming
desperate, perhaps sensing a coming spam apocalypse that their online ad
operations will not survive. We must "take them out" one by one through
sheer volumes of protests to hosts and through shared detective work.
Through a process of elimination, we CAN eventually make spamming
unprofitable and overly-laborious for the culprits. I wonder if we are
not already seeing the dying vestiges of spamdom, as spam entrepreneurs
at the bottom of Internet pyramid marketing scams try in vain to recover
their initial expenses or to make that mythical $10,000-up profit by
scattering junk email and Usenet ads all over creation. Fight the
bastards! Make them lose their accounts! Go for it! We have nothing to
lose and EVERYTHING to gain!

	Setting up and running smail on a system is the sysadmin's job.

	However, one thing you can try doing to see if your problem
is really a local MTA problem or another problem related to pine is to
go to setup/config and change the value of:

smtp-server              =

	to the hostname of a machine close to you.  I mean you could
set it to "mit.edu" but then pine would have to talk to that machine and
it would slow things down a bit.

I did as you suggested. The test mail that I have sent since all checks
out properly with the CST in parentheses as it should be. I did, in fact,
use mit.edu.

Dear all,

Here is a sequence of events:

29 December 96
--------------
6:20pm  Changed my finger name from "Peter" to "From comp.mail.pine".

6:30pm  Posted to comp.mail.pine as user "From comp.mail.pine".

7:30pm  I received a very long junk email from John Lester,
        gemsmaker@nicers.com.  The letter was addressed to "From
        comp.mail.pine".

NOTE: I have not posted under the name "From comp.mail.pine" to any other
group except for comp.mail.pine.  Clearly, this asshole pulled my email
address off of this newsgroup.

If you post to comp.mail.pine, be prepared to be entered on John Lester's
junk email list.  The junk email that I received is appended to the
bottom of this post.

If you actually read the junk email, please note that his "software"
targets AOL and compuserve memberlists among others.  I encourage
everyone to write to this person and complain.  

Sincerely,
Peter

ps- Also note how shitty his program is.  My first name is "From"...

You might not even know what I am talking about here! You may be
wondering, what IS direct emailing anyways? Direct emailing is a
radically new and massively cost-effective way of marketing that the
developer of Floodgate originated, but that NetContact has now
PERFECTED. In fact, check out this chart that will compare the costs of
Direct-Mail vs. Direct Email:

DIRECT-MAIL vs DIRECT EMAIL (1000 flyers)

ITEM:                                   DIRECT MAIL:                 EMAIL:

Flyers (printing)                     $100
Envelopes (plain white)             50
Postage (first class)                  320
Mailing List (fresh names)        150

TOTAL COST:                     $620

TIME INVESTED:             Folding, sorting,
                                           stuffing envelopes,
                                           roughly 3 hours per
                                           thousand

RESPONSE TIME:            6-8 business days                 INSTANT!

It's  SO INSTANT! that by the time Netcontact has finished mailing out
your direct emailing, you'll probably already have lots and lots of
inquiries for more information regarding your products and services  just
WAITING for you! Compared to direct mail, where you pay for mailing
lists, printing and postage, NetContact is a bargain. For the cost of JUST
ONE traditional mailing, you'll own a NetContact license and NEVER
AGAIN pay for lists, printing or postage!

BUT FORGET ABOUT SENDING OUT ONLY 1000 LETTERS!

YOU CAN SEND OUT 10,000+ MARKETING LETTERS EVERY
SINGLE DAY IF YOU WISH!

Or... every few days. In fact, when we send out 10,000 marketing letters
each day, it doesn't take long before we're completely SWAMPED with
e-mail inquiries and phone calls. This is very easy to do. You'll be
DELUGED with inquiries, leads, and real sales, using nothing but e-mail
too!

NETCONTACT FOR MS WINDOWS AND MAC (SOFTWINDOWS)!

Netcontact imports simple text files that anyone can download from
CompuServe, Prodigy, America Online, Delphi, Genie, the Internet
and much, much more. In fact, there's 18 different filters in all! In fact,
here they are, briefly:

1) Internet NewsGroup: NetContact has its own NewsGroup reader,
BUILT-IN! You simply check which groups you want addresses from,
thereby TARGETING your lists, and press GO! IT IS THAT SIMPLE!

2) Internet Miscellaneous File: You may have downloaded a web page or
other Internet Document that has email addresses in it. This filter will
strip out every one.

3) CompuServe Member Directory: There are approximately 4 million
members or more on CompuServe. You can get them all. You will learn
how to collect addresses sorted by city, state, etc.

4) CompuServe Classified Ads: We will teach you how to target your list
using this method. These are very responsive people as they check their
email often because of their ads.

5) CompuServe Forum Profiles: Thousands of addresses are available in
the profiles in each Forum. CompuServe has thousands of Forums.

6) CompuServe Forum Messages: Thousands of addresses are available
in the messages in each Forum.

7) CompuServe File Cabinet: You can extract all email addresses from
your CIM File Cabinet.

8) America Online Member Directory: AOL has even more members
than CompuServe. It allows you to sort the members with even more
parameters. You will learn how to sort by city, state, business type,
computer type, hobbies, etc.

9) America Online Classified Ads: Again, you can sort by many
parameters and extract thousands of addresses per hour.

10) America Online Forums: Lots of Forums to choose from, allowing
you to create CUSTOMIZED and TARGETED lists.

11) Prodigy Forums: Though Prodigy "only" has a little more than a
million members, this means there are still hundreds of thousands of
addresses available to you!

12) Delphi Member Directory: You can search the members by keyword,
allowing very CUSTOMIZED and TARGETED lists. Again, you can
pull thousands of addresses per hour.

13) Genie Member Directory: This member directory is similar to
CompuServe's. Very easy to extract addresses.

14) Genie Profiles: These profiles are similar to America Online's. Very
easy to extract addresses.

15) Eudora Mailbox: Important email addresses from a mailbox could be
used to maintain a client list, newsletter list, etc.

16) Netscape Mailbox: Same principle as the Eudora Mailbox.

17) Pegasus Mailbox: Same principle as the Eudora Mailbox.

18) Other: This filter allows you to scan ANY text document on your
computer for email addresses.

Again, these text files contain classified ads, forum messages, or data
from the member directory. Each of these files are FILLED with email
addresses. In fact, CompuServe has over 4,000,000 members; AOL has
over 6,000,000 members; not to mention the Internet with an estimated
40,000,000 members! And there are more people getting online EVERY
DAY! 1,000,000 NEW Internet participants PER MONTH, in fact! So
you can clearly see that your list is unlimited. By the time you work all of
these leads, there will be 40 million MORE brand new leads waiting for
you. And THAT'S EXCITING!

PERSONALIZED MESSAGES! THE KILLER DIFFERENCE!

Email broadcasting is much like direct mail in that you try to do as much
as you can to improve your response rate. One of the ways NetContact
does this is called the Personal Feature. NetContact, unlike Floodgate,
can actually slip the first name or the first AND last name of your
recipient into the broadcasted message - for EVERY recipient. Think
about how much more personal a message is when it starts with your
name. You are much more Iikely to read it.

BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE!

This personalized message feature ALSO uses the RECIPIENT'S
email address in the "To:" field. See the example below:

Using Other Software (i.e., Floodgate):

From: robert@xxxxxxx.com
(recipient list suppressed) (NOTE: or even worse by having 100
addresses appear here)

Just thought I'd drop you a note...etc.

USING NETCONTACT'S PERSONALIZED MESSAGE FEATURE:

From: robert@xxxxx.com
To: infinity@xxxxxx.com (NOTE: infinity@xxxxx.com IS JEFF's
PERSONAL email address!)

Jeff,

Just thought I'd drop you a note...etc.

WOW!

Can you feel how much more personal the second message is? Jeff's
OWN NAME is used AND the message is addressed to his FAMILIAR
PERSONAL email address instead of the to: field suspiciously NOT
appearing or, worse yet, (recipient list surpressed) appearing as is
typical with blind-carbon copy direct emailings (although with
NetContact, unlike Floodgate, you have a CHOICE; you can send direct
email thru the traditional, less effective blind-carbon copy method or the
Personal method: it's up to you). I can tell you from PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE that NetContact's Personal feature alone will improve
your response rate 10-fold. People are just more likely to read your
message if it appears that you took time to write them directly! And
direct email pro, psstt, lemme tell you what this does to flames: it
virtually ELIMINATES them, unlike Floodgate! And with what few
remove requests you do receive, guess what? NetContact, of course,
processes them almost AUTOMATICALLY for you, unlike Floodgate!

NO CUTTING AND PASTING, NETCONTACT DOES IT ALL!

NetContact will import all email names and addresses, sort and remove
duplicates very fast. All addresses are placed into a Microsoft Access
compatible database WITHIN NETCONTACT that you can not only
VIEW but MANUALLY access and manipulate! This means that you
can do even more with your list if you so desire. NetContact not only
extracts the email names and addresses, it also sends them with its
BUILT-IN EMAILER! You need purchase no other software as you
must with Floodgate to have a complete FROM START TO FINISH
sales process solution, for NetContact DOES IT ALL! There's no cutting
and pasting - You simply tell NetContact how many addresses you want
to send your message to: 100, 1000, 100,000 or more, then walk away, it
will do all the work.

WIZARDS WILL WALK YOU THROUGH EACH STEP!
               TOTALLY "DUMMY" PROOF!!!

For both the extracting process and the sending process, we have
employed Wizards. Wizards are a special window to guide a user
through an otherwise complex setup procedure which presents a question
or a group of questions on each screen where the user presses the "next"
button to be conveniently moved to the next helpful and simple screen
designed to walk you through each step. Wizards are the latest
innovation in user-friendly, sophisticated "store-bought" software. This is
a far cry from the complicated, poorly written, misspelling-infested 100+
pages of mind-numbing manual that accompanies Floodgate! In fact,
Netcontact has only six pages of paper documentation--the rest is
BUILT-IN to the program like any store-bought software (Netcontact
LOOKS like store-bought software, unlike Floodgate, by the way).
These WONDERFUL Wizards ensure that your addresses will be stored
correctly and your message will be sent perfectly every time. Using the
Wizards you can tell NetContact to skip addresses that you do not want,
such as any address ending in .EDU or .GOV., or addresses from certain
countries. Using the Wizards, you can assign a keyword to the batch of
addresses making it that much easier to sort them, or send a message to
only that group with the keyword. Because of features like these,
NetContact offers you the most possibilities when managing your list.
When sending mail, with the click of a mouse, you can select to use only
"fresh" names. You can even insert a code into each address sent. This is
handy for marketing analysis... you can keep track of which message you
sent to whom, allowing you to refine your marketing letter that much
faster.

HOW ARE WE BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION?

Read the GRID again and all of the other information above, then also
factor in:

**NetContact is a mature, bug free product. Not an initial release.
**NetContact is the only program with built-IN Wizards for EASY USE
**NetContact is the only one offering a complete 1-program solution!
**NetContact is by far the easiest to use.

If you order within the next 72 hours, the complete package is now
available for just $499.95 instead of the regular price of $599.95
plus we'll include your FREE Add-On Email-Oriented Sales Contact
Manager that is currently in development as soon as it becomes available!
To the best of our knowledge, this will be the
world's FIRST email-ORIENTED Sales Contact Manger!

NetContact will pay for itself in a few days. It will also cut your
advertising costs down to almost nothing. Think of what the
COMPETITION will do when they get THEIR NetContact program!
Don't be left in the DUST--there are 40 million people out there, just a
few keystrokes away. Let's do the math:

-Email 50,000 sales letters (takes a couple of hours)
-Let's say your product will bring you $20 profit per sale
-Let's also say you only get a 1% response (occasionally higher,
especially with the personal message feature to get things off on the right
foot with as many people as possible)

That's 500 orders x $20=$10,000 profit!! Now, imagine what 500,000
letters would do for your business!!

EXTRA! HERE ARE ACTUAL NETCONTACT USER
TESTIMONIALS:

"Great Results"

"When building and testing NetContact, the goal was to get as many
positive responses as possible out of a small mailing. In other words, use
this technology to get the best response rate. To test this I marketed an
MLM company that paid $40 in Fast Start Bonuses for every sign-up. By
the time I was finished with NetContact, the marketing letter I sent out
to a list of 500 brought an average of 16 sign-ups. That is, I made an
average of $640 every time I sent my message to 500 addresses. I found
another MLM that paid $80 for every sign-up. Imagine that, I would've
made $ 1280 every time I emailed 500 addresses. You can see from the
test results that NetContact will pay for itself very quickly. Of course
your marketing letter will effect your results, and I'll show you examples
that I used for the above test in NetContact's Documentation. Copy and
change them if you wish, but you might be better at marketing than I am
and achieve even better results."

-NetContact Developer

"Simply Awesome!"

"When I ordered I was kind of hesitant, but I must tell you that this
program is simply AWESOME. I can say with extreme conviction that it
is the best $500 that I have ever spent."

John Williamson
ATD Technologies


"Paid For Itself In 2 Days!"

"I market an MLM program through various kinds of advertising - Direct
Mail, Classified Ads, Internet Web Pages, etc., and now Direct E-mail. I
felt compelled to write and tell you that I received my copy on June 2nd,
and by June 4th I had made $825 in sign-up bonuses. This is the fastest I
have ever signed up people."

UPDATE FROM SAME PERSON, Mark Jennings:

"I just wanted to write and thank you again for writing such a great
program. I am now the #1 producer in my MLM. NetContact has
outdone all my other advertising COMBINED! The best part is Direct E-
mail is free."

Mark Jennings
World Plus Marketing Group


"Easy"

"Just wanted to write and let you know that I have had a great response
from my NetContact Mailings. Also, even though I am a fairly new
computer user and had never experienced the net until I bought your
program, NetContact was very easy to understand and does a great job
of getting you up and running quickly."

Beth Moore
Inteam International


"Returned Floodgate"

"After buying NetContact and putting out a couple of mailings I quickly
saw how much greater response the "personal feature" receives.
Compared with several mailings I had done using Floodgate and
Pegasus, NetContact brought in almost ten times the response. Also, I
only received a few people requesting to be removed from my "list", but
with Floodgate I received hundreds. Needless to say I returned
Floodgate for my money back. I'm sure that makes your day!"

pine cannot do this, but you can tell the user about the unix vacation

Read the man page for all sorts of options.

In pine go to setup and then config. Scroll down until you find a variable
named "Character Set". Add iso-8859-1 as value to that field. That will get
rid of the message you desribed above.

I wish that the folder list could indicate which folders have new mail.
It could be a sort option, but I'd really like to see the number of unread 
messages too.

    Pine will not filter incoming messages into separate folders for
you.  However, depending on your system, other programs can do so. 
Nancy McGough has an abundance of information on mail filtering on the
World Wide Web.  If you have a web browser, browse my home page and
follow the links to Nancy's pages.  You may find what you need there.

What version of Pine are you using?  What OS?  (I'll assume you're using
the default Bky mail folder format.)

Pine 3.95 under Linux 2.0.27.
I noticed this as far back as the 
3.7x pine versions, but attributed it
to my slow computers.  

I notice that you mention the default mail folder
format.  Do tell... can I use Pine with MH folders? 
Can they be mixed?  (e.g., inbox can be the default
format, but mailing lists can be mh folders?)

Thanks!

I've seen several questions/responses about Pine 3.95 compose "hanging" 
(or "locking") under AIX.  I applied the suggested changes to the pico
sources and have solved all problems but one.  The only persistent
"hanging" problem seems to be with NCSA Telnet on Macs.  Does this sound
familiar to anyone else?  

The particulars:  Pine 3.95 on AIX 4.1.4 and AIX 4.2
                  NCSA Telnet 2.7 on Macintosh System 7

This issue with the date string still has me really baffled. I sent two messages
just now, in fairly quick succession, using a different SMTP server ... the same
for both of the messages. The first message I sent put the control-A in the
Date: field, while the second put the correct time-zone string in it. I am
totally confused about this. It would have been nice if it had just been an SMTP
configuration error, but it seems to be something totally different. Any more
ideas?

Make a file called .forward in your home directory.
Put in there the email address that you want mail to go to.
Exit that and type:
chmod a+x .
chmod 644 .forward

You're done.

If you take a quick glance at the header (you know, the thing at the top of
your screen right now), you might notice a field that says "Attchmnt", which
is an abbreviation for "Attachment".
Use your cursor keys (the things on you keyboard that have little arrows
instead of letters) to navigate to the top of your message. Press ^T (strg or
ctrl while pressing the T key) when you've reached the "Attchmnt" field.

Enjoy.

James:

One other point to make.  If you are using a telnet client to access Pine
(for instance, a dial-up connection to an ISP), the attach files process
(^T) will only pull files that reside on the Unix Host you are using.  If
you have files on your PC (that you are using to make such a dial-up
connection) you'll have to use a FTP client to transfer the files from
your PC to your Unix home directory (or wherever else you want them).

Happy attaching!

Hello,

I currently have a unix account at my university where I use pine to read 
and send mail all the time as I'm doing now. I can also do this by 
connecting via PPP and then telneting into my Unix accoutn and running 
pine from there as I'm also doing now. However recently I tried to 
install Pc-Pine but I seem to be having trouble. It seems that I can not 
access my smtp-server as the smtp-server is not the same server as my shell
account. Because of this I think the smtp server is only accessible from 
the unix box where my shell account is located.

Is it possible that my university has made the smtp server not accessible 
unless you are connected to the unix box where my shell account is 
located and therefore I can not use Pc-Pine because of this reason or is 
there another problem which currently exists. This theory I would tend to 
believe as when I use pine normally on unix I first log in to my unix 
account which is known as sand and then after I type pine to access my 
Email I have to re-enter my account name and password on a server known as 
surf before I can access my Inbox to read any mail.

If anybody out there has any suggestions or any useful tricks to possibly 
work around this problem then please give me feedback.

Thanks...
Sean Innes

Sean:

This is quite possible.  I attend DePaul University in Chicago, where
students like me can access their Pine email on our unix hosts through the
following ways:

1)  In a academic computing lab (intranet) using Telnet
2)  By dialing up (normal communications software, not PPP) to the host,
which emulates a Unix terminal session
3)  By telnetting into the host where my mail account is, using any PPP
connection, and then emulating a Unix session

I cannot, however, use any POP3 or IMAP compatible client software (like
Eudora or the like) on my *PC* to access my mailbox, even though I may be
using PC-Pine.  (Believe me, I tried!)  If I wanted to do such, I need to
subscribe to the University's ISP (for a fee), and then they grant
permissions to the POP3 server to access my mailbox.  Upon paying this fee
and joining their ISP, I can still use a telnet Unix session (locally,
their ISP, or another ISP), *or* use a POP3 client to manage and send mail
from whatever PPP connection I like.

Now, don't get me wrong...  I use pine and my PC mail client
interchangeably (although I have an affection for Pine  :)  But, there are
obvious motivations for using your PC at home to send and receive mail, and
I wanted to be able to do such.  So, I have an ISP with a fully accessible
Unix email account (using telnet, pine, pop3, ... whatever).  But, my mail
from the University is automatically forwarded to the account I'm using
right now.  This way, I get my university mail, and any other mail in one
place.  One drawback:  I can't send email from my university account from
my PC POP3 mailer...  just read it.

It's a roundabout way, but it works.  Ask you sysadmin if this is the case.
 Best case, there might be some local issue on your servers that needs
correcting, or you might need special instructions.  He or she would be the
best person to ask.  Hope this helps.

Happy New Year!!!

I haven't tried it yet, but in one of the Linux groups someone posted:

	inbox-path={<insert POP3 server>/110}INBOX

Basically the same as what you posted, except I don't see a field named 
"Remote Inbox" in pine's configuration menu. I wonder if adding that line 
directly into the .pinerc and setting inbox-path to a local mail folder 
would allow pine to use both POP3 and local mail successfully.

The thing I fear about setting the inbox-path to the POP3 is that pine 
will probably scream that the inbox doesn't exist if you go into it while 
your PPP connection is down.

Once again, I didn't try this yet, but I will when I get home.

I use to have an E-mail address from my provider.

              rigos@panix.com

Then I got my own domain name and my E-mail address became 

             Evangelos@rigos.com

Pine still insists to use the old address.

How can I change my E-mail address to support my domain name?

Thanks

That is possible through using ansi-commands. It is unneccessary,
annoying and generally unwanted. Besides, it is known to have caused
considerable trouble with certain mail-servers and -clients. Don't do it
unless you _really_ have to.

	Agree 1000%.  Some terminals or terminal emulation SW will
lock up and require a reboot of the PC.

	If BOLD characters are *really* required then use word processor
SW or text/html.  Everyone has a browser these days....don't they.  :-)
