This is not supported in any news client I've seen, nor should it. The
action which you describe is against news netiquette and would no 
doubtably lead to the removal of your account at your internet provider
for spamming.

Sendmail allows you to do this, except you'd have to manually enter all
the headers like From:, To:, etc.  That's the only way *I* know of.

Try:

sendmail -fwhoever@iname.com recipient recipient etc
To: someone <someone@somewhere.com>
From: You <whoever@iname.com>
Subject: Something

this is how.

Hi,

I'm a user of Microsoft Mail, which seems to have one (more) bug : the body
of one of my correspondent's messages, who uses Pine, is not displayed,
though the whole message is downloaded (it even appears when viewing the
message source).

Does anyone has ever heard of an incompatibility between Pine and MS Mail ?

Is there something that can be done ?

Thanks.

As far as I understand it, I can configure PINE to access several
news-collections on multiple news servers, but it only supports
posting to the one nntp server that's configured in the nntp-server
configuration.  The other collections are effectively "read-only".

Obviously(?), one cannot post to a group that isn't supported by the
particular server that one has configured, even if it would otherwise
accept the posting.

Also, when the news collections are displayed in the menu, under each
news server it lists the entire menu of groups subscribed to, regardless
of whether they are really available on that server.  When you try to
access a group that the particular server does not support, it gives
error 411 No such group.

Have I understood the supported options correctly, or is there some
feature that I've missed?

As you may guess, I have read+post access to some limited-distribution
groups on a remote server, but need to access the rest of the normal
usenet groups repertoire via my normal server.

thanks for any suggestions

Hi, 

I have a problem.  When I am composing a mail and for whateer reason
have to attach a file (^T), and then decide to cancel the operation (^C)
I have always been returned to the mail I was composing with my 
command cancelled.

But, I have a new account, that when I do the same thing, essentially 
*suspends* the message, and *quits* to the unix prompt.  And I lose everything
(bwaaa haaaa!!).  Now if I want to exit from unix, I am told that I have 
suspended messages.

I would like to know 
(a) what config settings I need to have so that I dont get quit out of pine 
everytime I have to conacel some command

(b) What unix command do I use to recover/unsuspend suspended messages?

(c) what pine command do I need to use to recover/unsuspend suspended messages.

Matt 

p.s. I dont have a suspended folder in my pine, nor is anything saved in 
my posponed or saved folder.

p.p.s excuse the typos.

I am using Pine 3.95. I have two news servers set up in my configuration,
and two news folders for each. The second news server is foreign, not a
part of my ISP nntp server, and its newsgroups are not available on the
local nntp server. I can read groups from the foreign server, but cannot
post. Pine validates groups only on the local server. In the "secrets of
pine" help file, it states that Pine will only post to a second news
server listed in the configuration if the first news server is not
responding. This means that, if the first server responds, and the
requested newsgroup is not on that server, Pine will respond with an
error, and will not proceed to the second server.

Is there any way around this?

Thanks,
Tom Ed White

Sounds to me like it's just a matter of Pine (or unix?) interpretting your
keystrokes into the "suspend" command, (^Z).

You could de-select 'enable-suspend' from the Pine configuration screen.

>(b) What unix command do I use to recover/unsuspend suspended messages?

'fg' will put the last suspended job back into the foreground.

Well if it was, in fact Pine which was "suspending" your message, it would
be writing it to your postponed folder. I'm quite sure that it's a case of
Unix suspending the job.

Please DO NOT take this seriously.  The 'GOOD TIMES' virus is what you've 
already read.  There is no danger to your computer or its files.  The 
'GOOD TIMES' virus is nothing more than an e-mail message that has been 
propagated around the world more times than I would care to imagine.  
The message IS the virus, and spreading it to all of your friends to warn 
them only serves to put further strain on an already overwhelmed 
Internet.  

There are only two ways your computer can become infected with a virus
from e-mail:  one is if the e-mail is contains a Word for Windows macro
virus - but it would have to be put into your hard drive and run *as* a
Word macro.  The only other possibility of contracting a virus from email
is from an attached file, and you *still* won't infect your computer by
simply reading it.  There IS no virus that your computer can aquire from
your *reading* your e-mail.

There may be an easier way (I've only been using pine for one day now),
but the way I've been doing this is to use the Delete and Exclude
features (to make it think that the ones with no new news are empty),
and when I want to see all the new news, I go to the first one and let 
TAB take me to the next one with new news.  This way, it imitates pretty
closely the behavior I'm used to from .QWK-type offline readers, or
Maximus BBSes doing Browse/Tagged/New/Read.

I am one of the LSU email members, I just want to know whether the e-mail
message that I sent to my friend can be deleted in his account or not?
And also if it is still being kept in his account or not?  

I am waiting to hearing from you soon. Thanks.

does Pine automatically take care of the necessary correct headers for
eight-bit postings?

What features do you think should the system administrator set as
defaults for his users? My /usr/local/lib/pine.conf looks like
this:

character-set=ISO-8859-1
nntp-server=news.zrz.tu-berlin.de
printer=lpr


Any other ideas what could be set for lazy or novice users? (I don't use
pine myself, so I really can't say).

I also have this problem.  The Linux user name that i use... differs from the ISP user name... and so i must telnet to the ISP's server... in order to send mail.

Yet another lonely co-ed? Apart from that, Berlin sucks BIG time. Bonn is

Depends on the OS your pine is running on. To state the obvious, the easiest
thing to do is to rtfm:

man rm
man quota
man mv

If you're a very brave man, try the following:

cd (or cd Mail or where ever you suspect the large files to hide)
ls -alFS | less
rm <name of big file>


That should get you started right now. If you keep getting large files on a
regular basis, try to tell the senders that email is not made for that and
that they had better use ftp. Also, try to get more disk space if necessary
- talk to your sysadmin for that. He's also the person you ought to turn to
with problems like the one you're just having.


Cheers,
Robin

Hi !!
I tried to build pine3.95_heb2.07 on  4 by the command :"build a32".
It built a new window with the title PROGRAM BUILDER which vanish
afterwards.
In the command-line the message was:
check_tt_error:
tt_default_session_set: TT_ERR_SESSION  The session id passed is not the
name of an active session.
Exception Detected
 
Obviously, in this operating system the command build a32 do nothing.
Can you wrote me your opinion about this strange behaviour of AIX 4?

Thank You.

Maybe you should start off by trying to formulate whole sentences. That

For global settings, you need to set up a pine.conf in /usr/local/lib. At
a command prompt, type 

pine -conf > /usr/local/lib/pine.conf

Then go edit that file, making sure to assign only those items which you
want to be global. Make the file readable by all, and you should be set.

The .pinerc files are automatically put into the user's directory, so that
each user may be able to set up certain preferences. I don't know of any
way, (or any reason), to prevent Pine from putting them there.

You want to have a look at http://www.washington.edu/pine

there, you should be able to find all the information you need about Pine.

This is probably the remains of an old pine session which crashed. If so,
I believe all you have to do is to remove the file with

Subject: corrupted folder
Date: 31 Jan 1997 13:30:28 -0500
Message-ID: <ii.854734909@shellx>

I have a corrupted folder that I hope I can turn back into a folder
that Pine can understand.  Here's what happened...  it was on a VMS
system and I selected all and then saved to a new folder on the VMS
system (this is where I think the corruption happened but I didn't
discover it at this point).  Opened the new VMS folders and saved
all to my PC and left a copy of each msg on VMS.  Then I discovered
that both the VMS and my PC version of this folder are corrupted.
I thought that maybe I could use mbxcvt to fix things so I ftp'd
the folder to a Unix account and here are some things that happen:

When I try to open the folder with Unix pine I get:

 [Unable to parse internal header elements at 542: 58:57 +0000,1;000000000001]

When I try to convert the folder to mtx format with mbxcvt I get:

 ?Unable to parse internal header elements at 542: 58:57 +0000,1;000000000001


Any help appreciated.  BTW, has anyone noticed that VMS systems have trouble
saving all messages from a big folder?  Or maybe it's a problem with the IMAP
server they're using (which I'm pretty sure is not the UW one).

Thanks,
Nancy

This is easily fixed. When you set up your remote inbox, add in your
userid. It will still ask you for a password, but at least the username
will be correct.

# List of incoming msg folders besides INBOX, e.g. ={host2}inbox,
# {host3}inbox
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-host-name}folder-path
incoming-folders=remote {remote.machine.domain/user=user_id}INBOX,

If you need to set up a Reply-To header, put it in the customized-hdrs
entry:

# Add these customized headers (and possible default values) when
# composing
customized-hdrs=Reply-To: Your Name <user_id@remote.machine.domain>

I'm running Pine 3.95. When I try to open the inbox, it says "Last
message runs past end of file" and the inbox won't open.

Any ideas what could be causing this and how to fix it?

Reply by email (I have another mail program) or in this ng.

Thanks!

The types are the names of the c-client drivers; bezerk, mmdf, tenex, mtx,
mbx, mx,...

mh is a special case.  You need to be set up for mh (with a .mh_profile
file) and you also have to use the #mh namespace in the destination
mailbox name.  It may or may not work; personally, I wouldn't recommend
it.

The same way that Pine and imapd does, through the magic of c-client
dynamic type recognition.

> * Can I use mbxcvt to help me salvage a corrupted VMS-type folder?

No.  mbxcvt declines to deal with corrupt data.

Hold it right there!  How about upgrading to version 3.95 first?
Btw, the message id of your post says that you are using v3.89.

How about using the "save" command?

Sven is wrong on this one: the correct command is "View" followed by
"Save".

The "Save" command simply saves a copy of your current message and any
attachments it has to anbother folder, usually deleting it from the folder
it is in at the moment (configurable, if memory serves).

The "Export" command is related to the above, except it allows you to save
a copy of the message "outside" Pine's folder system.  In particular it is
written/added to a file in your home directory (or some other place that
you choose).

The "View" command is used to view individual attachments from a message.
Having given the View (V) command you will be shown a menu listing the
attachments to the message.  If Pine knows how to handle a particular type
of attachment you will be offered the chance to view it there and then,
otherwise you must save it to a file on disk.

Note that _where_ the attachment is saved depends to some extent on
whether you are using (UNIX) Pine or PC-Pine: UNIX Pine saves to your UNIX
filestore, whereas PC-Pine will save direct to your micro's local
hard/floppy disk.

If you are using (UNIX) Pine and want the file on your hard/floppy disk
you must:

	*  Save the attachment to a file on your UNIX filestore
	*  Quit Pine and run some sort of file transfer program
	   (ftp? Kermit? X-Modem?) to transfer it down to your micro's
	   disk.

You _may_ be able to persuade Pine to do this directly if you have
configured the following in its Setup Configuration screen:

	download-command         = <No Value Set>
	download-command-prefix  = <No Value Set>

However I confess to never having used these and so am unfamiliar with
them.  In particular I don't know whether they apply to the entire current
message, or can be applied to individual attachments.  (I'm sure the
builtin help system may reveal more information if you care to check it.
;-)

Cheers,

Your precis of the situation is, as far as I understand things, correct.

The one slight other snippet of information is that if IMAP is used to
_read_ the newsgroups (instead of NNTP) then each server lists only its
own newsgroups that you've subscribed to, not all of them.  This is
because an IMAP news connection keeps its state information on the IMAP
server machine (hence per-server), whereas an NNTP connection keeps its
state info at the client (Pine) end.

Cheers,

Yes, when writing a message press ctrl-r, it should give you "rich header"
(if not, enable it in your configuration), then write the addresses in bcc:

NO, Tracey, YOU ARE WRONG. **NORMAL** TEXT **IS** WHITE TEXT ON BLACK
BACKGROUND!!!  THAT IS NORMAL FOR ALL COMPUTERS FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS.
You must be using a god damn GUI -- probably Windows, right??? Ugh!!!
It is the black on white shit that is "disturbing" -- it is VERY BAD
on the eyes, causing eye strain. I can sit (and have) in front of a
white on black background for hours with no problem whatsoever. Pine
is SUPPOSED to be white on black background -- the NORMAL display for
all computers. I cannot help you. Get rid of your damn GUI and start
using DOS and/or Linux. GUIs are for little children and high school
dropouts.

In a previous article, tgun@rage.hostile.net (Tom Forgues) says:

>Hello I was wondering on how to detach a file to my hard drive or floppy?

[ 2 replies telling him to use the Save or Export commands ]

I don't think this is what he meant. "hard drive or floppy" implies
his OWN PC. If he uses Save or Export, it will only keep the file
on the UNIX system where he is logged in.

The correct answer is: you must download the file to your own PC.
There are two ways that you can do this. One way is to use Export
to save the file in your work area of your UNIX account, then
download the file after you exit Pine. (DON'T use Save here --
that won't work -- it only puts it into another mail folder.)
You will have to do this for every e-mail message (tedious).
The other way is to download the entire INBOX in one operation.
This is what I do. I typed up a file with much greater detail
on how to do this. It is, of course, specific to my ISP and may
not be correct for yours; but if you want it, I will e-mail it
to you upon request. Whichever method you choose, don't forget
to delete the file(s) from your UNIX account once they have
been successfully downloaded.

MH style folders can be used as incoming folders; however, MH format does
maintain enough state to support new mail checking.  The MH support in
Pine is strictly for compatibility purposes; it is not recommended for any
other purpose.  MH does not support the capabilities needed for full Pine
functionality.

Hello list,

Please forgive me if any part of this post is inapprorpriate to this user
community. 

I have a user who has no Quit option on his menu. When he presses "Q" the
programs responds appropriately, however, it does not appear on his menu.
have checked the archives for this list and have not come up with anything.
I have double-checked our system set-up, confirmed it works for others
(i.e., our system set-up -- Unix) and am stumped. Obviously, it's not a
show-stopper, but something requiring a solution nonetheless.

I look forward to benefitting from your wisdom. Please reply to me at my
personal address, since I am not a member of this list (Pine generally works
so well for us that subscription isn't necessary!).

I thank you in advance (and if this requires a summary, I'd be happy to post
one).

Regards,

        Sheryl

If your goal is just to be able to access all your mail easily from
either of your accounts then IMAP* is one nice way to do this.  In
order to do this, both your accounts need to support IMAP access to 
mail folders and you need to use a client that understands IMAP,
e.g., the great and powerful pine.  On each of your accounts, edit 
your .pinerc so that it contains something like the following:

incoming-folders={mail.ipoline.com/user=ngeddie}inbox,
	{mail.yourschool.edu/user=youruserid}inbox

The above lines will allow you to access either of your inboxes
when you go into the pine folder list (L).  The next lines will
all you to access your mail directory (and all the folders in it)
from either system:

folder-collections={mail.ipoline.com/user=ngeddie}mail/[],
	{mail.yourschool.edu/user=yourusedid}mail/[]


Of course you need to edit the above lines to specify the correct
servers and directories.

Good luck,
Nancy

        On the menu at the bottom, do you see an O(ther commands) key?
Does the Q(uit) command come around if you press the key a once or twice?
If so, the person may be calling pine with some "initial keystrokes" such
that the Q(uit) command is rotated off of the menu.

        Regards,

        Well, this is certainly not a question of right or wrong.  And it 
really isn't necessary to "SHOUT" at Tracey or belittle ones choice of using 
DOS, Win95, or even OS/2.  The fact that a certain screen format may cause 
you eyestrain is not indicative of what it may do to another person.

        Anyway....  I suspect that the problem, undesireable shift in 
display mode, may be caused by the a control charater being interpreted by 
the terminal emulation program as a command to shift display mode.  Without 
more
information of what terminal emulation program is in use it will be hard to
determine the next course of action.  If possible, I'd suggest trying a 
different user's method of accessing the system and see if the problem 
persists.

        Regards,

	Don't you just hate it when someone follows up their own messages?
I answered this one when I wasn't using pine...shame on me.

	Anyway, from initial menu there is no Q(uit) command visible.
You need to type O(others) to see the Q(uit) command.  But it is there and
active and a "natural".  I don't believe there is a way to change the
order of what appears on the screen.  

	So, its not a bug....its a feature.  Why show Q(uit) when everyone
know it.  :-) :-)

	Ed

  Perhaps you need to clean up your account a little bit.
  If you're on a UNIX system, you can use "rm file" to delete a file named
"file". You can use "zip" or "gzip" to compress files. Type "man zip" and
"man gzip" for command line parameters and more information.

  Hope this helps.

I have three HP Printers (600C, 660Cse, and OfficeJet 350), none of which
will print e-mail from pine.  My previous dot matrix printers worked fine.
Is there something with the DeskJet printers that doesn't work with Pine?
Help Please!!!!  By the way the printers print everything else, no
problem.  They are on three different computers, all IBM, and all
different speeds (66MHZ, 100MHZ, and 200MHZ).  There must be a solution
out there.  Thanks for reading.

I just compiled pine3.96 with patch-1 using both gcc and
SUNWspro on a sparcstation5 running Solaris 2.5. I set the
smtp-server="a good host name" verified through telent/ping
nslookup etc....

I keep getting an 'Error sending: No such host as "a good host name"'
when sending a mail message.

I tracked it down to a failing call to gethostbyname. Has anyone
seen this or has any suggestions???

BTW: The "a good host name" is the same as the IMAP server and this
     connection works!

Thanks in advance.

Ummm.... I'm not sure which thing you have changed here: was it the
"user-domain" variable?  (There isn't a "Reply-to Host" as standard.)
Whatever it was I suggest you change it back to how it was and instead do
this:

1.  Start Pine and go to the Setup Configuration screen.

2.  Go down to the "customized-hdrs" variable.

3.  If this does NOT have a "Reply-to:" value (possibly along with others)
    you need to add one (using the "A" (Add) command).
    If it DOES have a "Reply-to:" value you need to check/change the
    remainder of this.

    In particular you want to end up with something like this:

	Reply-to: Piel Jayce <jayce@cavalry.com>

Adding the "Reply-to:" header will cause this header to be available for
every message you send (it won't appear on the Composer screen by default;
you need to put the cursor on a header line and type ^R).

By also setting a value for the "Reply-to:" header (the "Piel Jayce
<jayce@cavalry.com>" in the above) this will get set up by default as the
value of the Reply-to: header for every message you send.

Incidentally, are you sure that you haven't already got this working?
Your question appeared on the comp.mail.pine/Pine-Info forum as having
come from:

	Piel Jayce <jayce@cavalry.com>

which is, I think, what you said you wanted to achieve?

Cheers,

There isn't anything that you can put in your message (or option to set
within Pine) to ask that an undelivered message be bounced back to you (or
not).

This is purely a function of the intermediate and final mail delivery
systems.

That said, the default for such systems is usually to return undeliverable
mail to the sender.

The "bounce" options that you mention are nothing to do with returning
undeliverable mail.  Instead they are to do with a command (B - Bounce)
that allows you to redirect a message you have received on to someone
else, but making it appear (for reply purposes) as if it still originated
from the original author rather than yourself.

Specifically, the "enable-bounce-cmd" enables this Bounce (B) command; it
is not available by default to avoid confusing new users.  And the
"fcc-on-bounce" option tells Pine to save a copy of a message you Bounce
in any Fcc folder you have set up (the default is not to do so).

Cheers,

There is also the source of two guides "Starting use of Pine" and a

: I did it, but I just grabbed the src.rpm from 
: RedHat and used that to start with. There are
: a few patches that they made to get it to run.

 I'm afraid 'signal 11' is a much more ominous sign than that Pine 3.95
source needs some patch to get compiled under Sparc Linux.
Not that patches are unnecessary but that signal 11 must have
come from sort of hardware failure such as defect in
SIMM module on the machine in question. There's a web page
dealing with various reasons for 'signal 11', but I don't
have URL handy at the moment. You may search for 'signal 11 and
linux' with search engine.

Using Red Hat Linux 4.0 + updates.  Pine 3.95.

I'm trying to use Pine 3.95 to connect to an IMAP server.  It appears,
though, that Pine is configured to attempt to use rsh to invoke rimapd
before trying imap directly.  (1) Why?  (2) Is there a way to change this?
My mail server isn't about to allow users to rsh into it.  Having to
wait 10 seconds for rsh to fail each time I attempt to access a new
folder is rather annoying.

To answer my own question: set the "rsh-open-timeout" option in 
"$HOME/.pinerc" to "0":

# Sets the time in seconds that Pine will attempt to open a UNIX remote
# shell connection.  The default is 15, min is 5, and max is unlimited.
# Zero disables rsh altogether.
rsh-open-timeout=0

    Personally, I don't think one would worry about the extra headers.  The
two/from and bounced-to/bounced-from are the same, it means it was resent
which is exactly what the original poster wanted.

Could you please provide us with some details on what goes wrong?

It should compile just fine, providing you have the crypt supplement
installed (the SCO Internation crypt supplement can be obtained as lng225b
from ftp.sco.com in the directory SLS). You'll need this supplement if you
get link errors on a function call containing the word "crypt".

Should you decide to install the supplement, you'll have to manually
execute the statement

   ln /usr/lib/libcrypt_i.a /usr/lib/libcrypt.a 

afterwards to get the correct library name for Pine.

Again, please provide more details if things continue to go wrong.

Best regards,

- Richard Gering.

Not at all... unless you've checked the message with the guys from
net-abuse. If you still feel like doing it nonetheless, be prepared for
nasty surprises.

You can find this on the World-Wide Web at:

	http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/QandA/index.html

Other information about Pine can be found at the Pine Information Centre:

Ummm.... there are, of course, quite legitimate cases for posting an
article to two or more newsgroups.  (I do it with our local newsgroups
when trying to move an off-group thread from one group to another.)

To post an article to more than one newsgroup just list the newsgroup
names with commas in between (this information is in Pine's built-in help
somewhere, but apparently not in the obvious place: the description of the
"Newsgroups:" header -- I'll suggest it to the Pine Team).

However as Robin says, do use this facility wisely and in moderation:
people don't like seeing the same article cross-posted gazillions of
times.

Cheers,

Just for further information...

Setting the "rsh-open-timeout" to 0 is certainly one way of avoiding the
attempted rsh opening of mail folders.  (This variable can only be set by
editing the .pinerc file; there isn't a way to do this from within Pine's
own Setup Configuration screen.)

Note, however, that this affects connections to all IMAP servers.

If you are using some servers which do support rsh connections then you
may instead prefer to leave the rsh-open-timeout alone.  The attempt to
rsh to the non-rsh'able servers can be suppressed _just for them_ by
appending their IMAP port number to their hostname in your setup.  The
default port number for IMAP is 143, so a mailbox spec would then become
something like: 

	{imap.site.domain:143}inbox

Hmm, you could have it resent. Or you could check your Mail folder for a
file called 
	READ-MESSAGES-jan-1996.gz
e.g. by typing
	locate READ-MESSAGES
if you're on a u*ix system.

You cannot access this file via pine. You can read it, though, using either
a new version of less or zless ( to make sure you have those, type "which
less" "which zless"):
	less READ-MESSAGES-jan-1996.gz
would let you browse through that file using your cursor keys.
If your system doesn't have less, use more or zmore respectively, but ask
your sysadmin to install less.

Using the correct address-"style"? AOL-addresses are different from internet
addresses.

I've been receiving spam e-mail lately, and I wondered if putting a fake
address with the Reply-to: header would resolve the problem.  I'd use the
From: header instead, but this site doesn't allow users to change it.
Does anyone know if those spambots use Reply-to: at all, or do they only
use From:, therefore making Reply-to: useless to avoid spam?

Robin is obviously one of those there Unix geek type
individuals my mother warned me about.

gnu-zip a sent-mail file?  Huh?  You have wierd
sysadmins, Robin.  Also, all the versions of Pine ever
loaded on our Unix system here have had saved-sent-mail
folder naming formats of something like
sent-mail-month-year

I don't think I've *ever* seen a 'read-mail-whatever'
foldername.

And yes, you should be able to access any monthly
sent-mail folder from Pine's folder list.  

As to the less is more argument, well, whatever.  Fun
with Stupid Unix tricks, I guess.

BUT!  I COULD BE WRONG!
(sounds rather pathetic when shouted, actually)

How about a description of the actual problem?  How do
you know there's a problem and how do you know it's
limited to AOL users?  What error messages are you
getting, if any, and if you're getting bounced mail,
what kind of information is in the header?  The more

Your "new" nephew? What happened to the old one? *argl* 

Ok, the answer depends on the OS you're using. 
For Dos, Dos 3.x, Dos95 and Dos NT, there's quite a few free- or shareware
viewers at
	http://www.yahoo.com
Check the software, viewers section. Depending on what you want to do with
the pictures, there are a couple of rather outstanding programs:

Lview 
	(versatile, fast, can r/w almost anything)
ViewPro 	
	(good for movie files >;->)
Thumbs Plus 
	(if you have a *lot* of pictures [/me thinks .o0(any1 trdng"?))
Search 
	(if you have a *lot* of pictures and want to make them accessible
	through www-pages).


For real OSs (u*ices, that is), there's, e.g.:

The Gimp
Image Magick
XView

Check your favourite search-engine for those, e.g.:
	http://www.metacrawler.com

What does that question have to do with pine? Why are there so many letters
in the answer...?

Cheers,
Robin

Sure. And if you keep collecting them, you'll be every sysadmin's darling.
And if yall there at UAlberta.CA go ahead and do that, hard-drives will
become pretty expensive soon, due to world-wide shortages caused by
Californian students ignorant of compression tools.

If you're <censored> enough to keep them uncompressed - yes. I'll talk to

As opposed to what? 3rd class sarcasm, spiced with some half-digested

on the grounds of profound experiences with advanced OSs like Windows? Been
hacking away at some fancy Visual Basic ++ lately?

Anyone got any suggestion how those could be sensibly linked to each other?

Ok, there seems to be a slight misunderstanding. The original post didn't
shout anything about "sent" or "read" messages. It said: HAVE LOST ALL MY
PRIOR E-MAIL, so that could be both. As for the gzip-files, those are in
fact my own divination, used for storing large amounts of mail. I open pine
with a shell script that opens and closes certain folders "on the fly".

So the truth is buried beneath tons of hate-mail:
The mail is stored in folders labelled <somethin>-month-year, be that
sent-mail, read-messages or something your sysadmin made up. Locate should
still work, or
	find -name "<part of filename from .pinere>" -print
invoked from your home dir.
If you your pine moves those folders to a directory different from your
Mail-dir, you won't be able to access those files with pine, except by
setting up a folder collection (see tech-notes).

Can you live with that, Lea?

Cheers,
Robin

Debug output of the Pine program (at debug level 2).  Version 3.93
Wed Feb  5 16:38:41 1997

	<Major snip of debug file>

        feature-level : sapling

I'm curious at to what this feature-level means. 
I've noticed this in many debug files sent to this group for help
purposes and I clipped this from my own .pine-debug file.

Where does this feature get set?  At what point, if any, does this level
change from a sapling to a *bigger tree*?  I've looked in the tech-notes and
can't find anything on this.

Can anyone give me the details?

Thanks!

Greetings!

     I am trying to run pine from my unix account and do not know
which file to download from the ftp site.  I downloaded pc-pine for
windows and seem to have trouble getting it started.  I really want
the unix version instead.  Please specify which file to get.

Thanks Dave

Long ago and far away, Pine had only a small number of features, and they
were grouped into a couple of cute categories like "sapling" and "old
growth".  This model didn't scale very well, so now Pine has individual
features.  In other words, the "feature-level" variable is now obsolete.

please tell me that i can use a "disk editor" or some data recovery service to
recover lost email that was "eXpunge"d with PINE 3.95 on FreeBSD 2.1.5 !!!

it's desperately needed for a legal matter!

i haven't used the disk (hard drive) since the eXpunge, although i have
booted the machine once.  i hope no "log files" have over-written the 
previous data.

can you please adivise me what to do?  i don't have a disk editor currently on
the machine, and would be scared to get one and put it on the drive.  this is 
VERY important that i recover the data!  please tell me it's possible !!!

thanks much!

etc.  Also, is there any limit to how many messages i can store at any one
time?

Judging from these missing files it would seem that you don't have the
TCP/IP development system installed. To check this, execute the command
"swconfig | grep TCP". Its output should be similar to the following: 

  SCO TCP/IP Development System    1.2.1i    installed        
  SCO TCP/IP Runtime System        1.2.1o    installed        

In the "good" old days, SCO had you buy the SCO TCP/IP development system
separately from the generic development system. It looks like this
additional product was never purchased/installed on your server. Oops... 

You can try to obtain the TCP/IP Development System for 3.2v4.2, but this
can prove difficult since that product has officially been withdrawn as of
January 1st 1997. Some dealer might still have one on stock, though.

Alternate solutions:

- If 3.2v4.2 is a requirement, you can still get the Desktop Development
  System (version 3) which should include TCP/IP. Unfortunately, you
  also need SCO Desktop or SCO Enterprise version 3. Expensive!

- Upgrade to SCO OpenServer 5 with its development system. These days
  the development system includes TCP/IP :-)  Not very cheap either.

- If what you are trying to do is non-commercial/you are a student/you are
  doing this privately, you can get an OpenServer 5 Desktop system WITH
  its development system for free(!)  Even though we are talking about
  a Desktop system and not a server, the TCP/IP code should still be part
  of the Development System. Check out www.sco.com.

Then again, your TCP/IP development system might simply be laying in a
closet under a load of dust just waiting to be installed :-) 

I hope this information can get you a bit further. Good luck!

You'll need to get a Email program that supports MIME.  There is no mime
decoder that I know of..  All (that I know of) of Microsoft's Products
support MIME.  I recommend upgrading to Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0,
which comes with a good Email program that supports MIME.

I got this forwared to me yesterday.  Thought I'd pass it along so 
everyone can write and tell them we don't want per-minute Internet 
charges from the phone company, as that would kill much of the activity 
that makes the Internet so great.


----------------Forwarded message follows------------------------

 I am writing you this to inform you of a very important matter
 currently under review by the FCC.  Your local telephone company has
 filed a proposal with the FCC to impose per minute charges for your
 internet service.  They contend that your usage has or will hinder
 the operation of the telephone network.

 It is my belief that internet usage will diminish if users were
 required to pay additional per minute charges.  The FCC has created
 an email box for your comments, responses must be received by February
 13, 1997.  Send your comments to isp@fcc.gov and tell them what you
 think.

 Every phone company is in on this one, and they are trying to sneak
 it in just under the wire for litiagation.  Let everyone you know
 here this one.  Get the e-mail address to everyone you can think of.



Internet and Interstate Information Services

In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on interstate access charge reform,
released on December 24, 1996, the Commission sought comment on how FCC
rules can provide incentives for investment and innovation in the
underlying networks that support the Internet and other information
services. The Commission made no specific proposals, but tentatively
concluded that providers of information services (including Internet
service providers) should not be subject to the interstate access
charges that local telephone companies currently assess on long-distance
carriers.  Comments in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are
due on January 27, 1997 and reply comments are due on February 13, 1997.

At the same time, the Commission initiated a Notice of Inquiry contained
in Section X of the same document to examine the more fundamental issues
about the implications of emerging data services for the public switched
telephone network. In the Notice of Inquiry, the Commission sought
comment on the effects of increasing Internet usage on the network,
alternative technologies to alleviate network congestion and provide
higher bandwidth, and how FCC actions could facilitate efficient
deployment of such technologies.  Comments in response to the Notice of
Inquiry are due on February 21, 1997, and reply comments are due on
March 24, 1997.

Parties that wish to file formal comments in these proceedings should
follow the procedures set forth in the Access Reform Notice. General
information on filing comments with the FCC is also available.
Individuals or organizations that wish to submit informal comments
electronically in response to the Access Reform Notice may use the
Commission's e-mail box, access@fcc.gov.  The docket number for this
proceeding is CC Docket Number 96-262. The Commission has also
established an e-mail box, isp@fcc.gov, for informal public comments on
issues related to the Internet and information services. The docket
number to reference for this proceeding is CC Docket Number 96-263.

 
A little background....

Way back in 1983, the FCC exempted "enhanced service providers" from
telephone per-minute access charges.  This was to encourage the
development of data (as opposed to voice) services.  Internet Service
Providers such as EasyStreet are considered "enhanced service providers"
so we do not pay per-minute access charges for our phone lines (the
lines you call in to).

This is now....

The RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies - USWest, etc) have now
asked the FCC to charge "enhanced service providers" for per-minute
access charges.  They claim that there's no longer any need to encourage
data services and that the huge increase in Internet usage is causing
them be build new, unplanned for, infrastructure.  These charges could
be as much as $1.00/hour of connect time.  Most likely, these charges
would be passed on to users (you).

Thankfully, the FCC is asking for informal user comments.  They even
have an e-mail address for your comments.  We encourage you to make your
opinions known.

1. You don't want to save those messages, but fcc: them instead - folder
carbon copy. In order to do this, you need to take the address book and fill
in an fcc: for the respective person. Pine will then ask you if it should
create a folder next time you send this person a message.

2. "for stuff sent to [you] for school", i.e. incoming mail, you'll need a
filtering program. Check:
ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de for:
	pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz.
There  exists  a mailinglist for questions relating to any program in the
procmail package: 
	<procmail@informatik.rwth-aachen.de> for submitting questions/answers. 
	<procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de> for subscription requests.

3. The only limit you might have for storing messages is the size of your
hdd - physical or virtual. Check the free space with
	df
or
	quota
or check the space your directories take with
	du

Cheers,
Robin

Hello. I am a frequent user of Pine and having just switched to the new,
improved version, I found a bug. It is not really a big problem and I know
how to get around it, but it is annoying, none the less.  The problem is
that when you are repsonding to a message you have received, using the
relpy command, and there is a list of people who receive the message, it
asks you if you want to reply to all recipients. This has not changed.
However, now, when you say that yes, you would like to reply to all, in
now includes sending the message to yourself. While you can easily just
take yourself off the list each time, it never used to do this. I see no
reason for receiving the message yourself whe you already get it in sent
mail.

You need Bellcore's metamail package. It comes with a mailcap file which
lets you link an application to a certain kind of mime-message. E.g., it
allows you to start lynx when someone has used an ADVANCED Email system like
Microsoft Explorer to compose FANCY and MULTIMEDIAL Email messages.

In particular, I'd recommend qbasic and Excel. They're GREAT for reading and
writing MIME mail (Mickysoft Internet Mail Eczema). Plus, they're fully
binary-combatible to all platforms available: Intel, Intel and Intel.

I've never come with that program, but I'm sure you got one hell of a kick
out of it. While we're at it - what program do you want to upgrade from
today? Regedit.exe? And what exactly is that "good Email program that
supports MIME" called?

Cheers,
Robin

It must be something in your setup.  I am using 3.94 on Solaris 2.5
and the "reply" command does not include my address.

I have the same problem on two of my systems; Sometimes it takes three to
five minutes for a small message to be sent.  I still have the old version
of pine, 3.91, on my HPUX system.  When I run the old pine I encounter no
such problems or delays in sending messages.

I have Pine3.95 on a Solaris 2.5 box and a BSDI2.1 box as well.  The BSDI
box has no problem or delay, but the Solaris box has the same problem and
delay as the HPUX system.

I appreciate a pointer to the solution.

Thank you,

Joe

        Try X as is eXpunge.  While you are at it you may as will try using 
the context sensitive help and read the help menus.  You'll be glad you did.

This is for messages you send out to others and for which you want to keep
copies.  A number of people do this by cc-ing a copy of the message to
themselves (by putting their own e-mail address in the "Cc:" header field
of the message).  However a much more efficient way is to use the "Fcc"
trick Robin mentions.

"Fcc" (File Carbon Copy) simply saves a copy of the message straight to
the specified folder.  Compare this with Cc, which e-mails you a copy of
the message (perhaps involving delays if your mail server is overloaded)
which then arrives back in your INBOX along with all the other messages
you receive.  It is then up to you to Save it to a folder.  Much simpler
to use Fcc and just put it straight into the folder automatically as the
message is first sent.

If you just want to save the occasional outgoing message you can do this
by putting the cursor on the any of the header lines of th emessage you're
composing and then typing ^R (Rich Headers).  This shows you _all_ the
headers that are available to you to set.  One of these is the "Fcc:"
header, into which you can type the name of a folder (see below).  If you
can't remember the folder name you can use ^T (To Folders) to dispay them
and pick one using the cursor keys.

If, however, you want to save copies of most/all of your outgoing messages
then it is best to set up a default fcc folder.  Every message you then
send will then have a copy saved to this folder.  You set this up in
Pine's Setup Configuration screen (S then C at the Main Menu) by giving
the name of the folder to use (often "sent-mail") as the value for the
"default-fcc" variable.

If you occasionally send a message you _don't_ want saving in this folder
(perhaps it has a very large file attached to it) then use the ^R trick
mentioned above to see the Rich Headers when composing your message and
_delete_ the (default) folder name from the "Fcc:" header line.  Of course
you can also do this to specify some other folder to save the message to
instead.

One last neat trick in this area is in the Address Book.  For each entry
in your Address Book you can, if you wish, set up an Fcc value.  If you
send a message/reply/etc to this person (and they are the first e-mail
address mentioned in the "To:" field) this folder will be used for the Fcc
copy instead of the default folder.  This helps you automatically file
outgoing messages sent to a colleague into the folder you keep for use
with their messages.

Actually you only need procmail (or filter, or any of the other foltering
programs) if you want to direct incoming messages into folders _as they
arrive_ (ie, before you've even read it).  This can be useful at times if,
for example, you're a member of several busy mailing lists.  Using
procmail you can direct messages from each list into a separate folder
just for that list and read them later at your leisure.

Indeed, you can even set Pine up to "know" about these alternate incoming
folders by editing its .pinerc settings file and listing the folders'
names as the value of the "incoming-folders" variable.  Then, when you
reach the end of one of these incoming folders (eg, your usual INBOX), you
can just press the Tab key for Pine to automatically check the other
incoming folders for recent mail; if it finds any it will offer you the
chance to read it. 

If you are happy with receiving mail just in your INBOX (a lot of people
are) you might perhaps be asking just how to (manually) save messages to
folders to keep for later reference.  This is very easy:

*  Just read the message (or put your cursor on it in the Index screen),
   then

*  Type S (Save).  This will ask you for the name of a folder to store the
   message in.  Just type in the folder name and press Return: the message
   will be saved into it.  If you can't remember the folder name type ^T
   and Pine will show you a list of all the existing folders and let you
   pick one with the cursor keys.

*  If you type in a name of a folder which doesn't exist Pine will offer
   to create it for you (this is how you make a new folder).

You can see what folders you have, open them, rename them, delete them,
etc, in the List Folders screen (give the L command at most screens: Main
Menu; Index screen; message reading screen; etc)

Further reading: The built-in help in some of Pine's screens:
	*  The Main Menu
	*  The Folder List (L command's screen)
	*  The Folder Index (I command's screen)

"df" tells you the amount of free space left on your computer's various
disks (you may not be allowed to use some of the disks, or all of the
space on a particular disk!).  To just check "your" disk (where your
current directory lives) try:

	df .

which will omit all the other disk drives, perhaps making it easier to see
which figure applies to you.

"quota" warns you if you have exceeded your normal storage allowance on
the disk drive, as set by the manager of your computer system.  If you are
under this normal allowance it just doesn't say anything (at least, on
most systems).  To see how much quota you have in use try adding the "-v'
option to the command:

	quota -v

By the way, be warned that your computer _may_ use different units for the
figures given by df, du and quota.  For example on our systems df and du
reports in "blocks" (where 1 blobk = 512 bytes = 0.5 Kb for our disks),
but quota reports in Kb.  This can confuse people who think that du and
quota are reporting wildly different usage figures, when in fact they
should be pretty close/identical.

Pine figures out "your" e-mail address by following various rules to
generate it from your username, the name of the computer you are using,
and perhaps some things set up by the System Manager who set Pine up for
your computers.

However it may be that what Pine has figured out doesn't quite match the
e-mail address used by the messages being delivered to you.  (For example,
my proper e-mail address is "pmb1@york.ac.uk" but some other computer
names work for me to, and I also have some other usernames set to forward
their e-mail to me.)

Try sending your self a message and checking very carefully the e-mail
address shown in the "From:" and "To:" headers when it arrives.  This may
be different (even very slightly is enough) from what Pine thinks is your
e-mail address; because the don't match exactly it then assumes the other
address is of someone else, and so includes it when you try sending a
reply. 

The easiest solution is to add the "other" address to the list of
"laternate addresses" that Pine should assume are also "you".  This is
very simple: in the Setup Configuration screen (S then C at the Main Menu)
look for the "alt-addresses" variable and put your cursor on it.  Then
type "?" to look at the built-in help about it.  You should set this to
any other e-mail address(es) that you can be reached as (such as the one
in the "From:" and/or "To:" headers of the emssage you sent to yourself.

You may like to mention it to the people who look after Pine at your site,
as it may be that others are suffering from the problem too.  In which
case the central configuration of Pine may not be quite right for your
site, and need a little tweaking by the System Managers in order to fix it
for everybody at once.

Cheers,

You might still want to run a filtering program to save you the hassle of
saving manually *after* you read the message. Of course, procmail can do
that, too.

You don't have to type the entire name, as pine offers tab-completion. Give
your folders *unique* names and press tab after the first two or three
letters....

Some "further reading" also made me aware of this:

   Some of the options which can be set when compiling:
      USE_QUOTAS
      Determines whether quotas are checked on startup. Default is to not
      check the quota.

That's a pretty neat feature...

Robin

I have the same problem on two of my systems; Sometimes it takes three to
five minutes for a small message to be sent.  I still have the old version
of pine, 3.91, on my HPUX system.  When I run the old pine I encounter no
such problems or delays in sending messages.

I have Pine3.95 on a Solaris 2.5 box and a BSDI2.1 box as well.  The BSDI
box has no problem or delay, but the Solaris box has the same problem and
delay as the HPUX system.

I appreciate a pointer to the solution.

Thank you,

Joe

> Can you type back and forth on e-mail like you can with aol?

        Email is not interactive.

        According to the news reports these days the only "talking back and 
forth" on AOL these days is between customers, customer service, and 
lawyers.  :-)

Subject: Subject change

Is it possible to change the subject of a message that is forwarded by a
.forward file?

I want the subjects from all messages, forwarded from mailbox one to mailbox
two, automatically preceded by the text '[one]', brackets included. Is there
any way to change the subject?

Thanks for helping me out!

Hello good people at Pine:

Actually, this isn't a true "bug" report.  What I wanted to know was, how 
can I take two or more messages that I've received, and combine them into 
one message in order to forward them onward?

Yours, 
Don

        Please check your setup/config to see if you have the following 
feature enabled.

        FEATURE: auto-move-read-msgs
 
This feature controls an aspect of Pine's behavior upon quitting.  If set,
and the "read-message-folder" variable is also set, then Pine will
automatically transfer all read messages to the designated folder and mark
them as deleted in the INBOX.  Messages in the INBOX marked with an "N"
(meaning New, or unseen) are not affected.

Two basic options I can think of:

On an advanced OS, you can cut and paste them into one message, which still
is a hassle, because you need to postpone the new message in order to c&p
the 2nd msg.

Or you could use an editor other than pine's pico, one that allows you to
cut&save text and then read it into another message. A good and *simple*
alternative (anyone following up this message saying vim / emacs / blablabla
rules will be seriously flamed) would be Joe or some other *small* editor.

Since pico is nice for writing messages, but not very versatile when it
comes to editing and formatting texts, it might be a good idea to invoke
this editor implicitly. 

In Setup, Config, check:
            [ ]  enable-alternate-editor-cmd
            [ ]  enable-alternate-editor-implicitly
and then:                        
	editor                   = <your editor>

Save and enjoy.

Cheers,
Robin

P.S. Thanks a bunch for submitting your config. That was a nice touch.

I think you got the question entirely wrong. What she meant was: Do my
emails get bounced, too, when I use Pine instead of AOL? And the answer is,
of course: If you're using an aol address, your mail will most likely get
bounced. To make sure it gets bounced, please use the appropriate (or is it
default?) subjects like "ME TOO!!!", "MAKE MONEY FAST" or "PLEASE MAILBOMB
ME!!!".

Cheers,
Robin

Sure, but that's nothing to do with pine. You'll need a filtering program to
do that for you. The procmail package, e.g., comes with a program called
formail that does exactly that (and a few thousand other things, too).

Read the Filtering FAQ by Nancy McGough at:
	http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/
        http://www.best.com/~ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/

Also take a look at Marianne Aldridge's FAQ collections at:
	http://www.ualberta.ca/~maldridg/tutor/Tutorials.html
        http://gpu.srv.ualberta.ca/~maldridg/Wiz/Wizard
They're provokingly cute, but good.

Not very likely to happen. Most likely, your mail got pruned to a folder
called READ-MESSAGES-jan-1997 or something like that. Make sure that this
folder is not there before throwing a fit. Take a look at your configuration
for the following:

	# List of context and folder pairs, delimited by a space, to be
	# offered for pruning each month. For example: {host1}mail/[] mumble
	pruned-folders=
	
	# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.
	last-time-prune-questioned=97.2

Then, type L to see your List of folders.If, however, this folder really
doesn't exist, get ready to panic and consult your sysadmin to locate the
mail. Unless you've toyed around with commands like rm, there's a good
chance it will be found.

Besides, as far as important information on computers is concerned, the old
Leisure Suit Larry rule still holds true: Save often, save early.

Cheers,
Robin

Yes it is: Set up a filter that *asks* before it sends any mail with AOL in
it to /dev/null (or bounces it, attaching nice X-sources...).

On second thought, she might mean this:

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++
        FEATURE: allow-talk
        
By default, permission for others to "talk" to your terminal is turned off
when you are running Pine. When this feature is set, permission is instead
turned on. If enabled, you may see unexpected messages in the middle of your
Pine screen from someone attempting to contact you via the "talk" program.

Note: The "talk" program has nothing to do with Pine or email.  The talk
daemon on your system will attempt to print a message on your screen when
someone else is trying to contact you. If you wish to see these messages
while you are running Pine, you should enable this feature.

If you do enable this feature and see a "talk" message, you must suspend or
quit Pine before you can respond.
++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++

This can be set in the M(ain) screen under S(etup) C(onfig):

feature-list  =
            Set  Feature Name
            ---  ----------------------
            [ ]  allow-talk
                                    

but who would want to talk to an AOL-user? I'd rather use a cron-job sending
ME TOO!!!s to /dev/null, which imnsho would be the closest equivalent to
that.

Cheers,
Robin

        I get many things wrong....but we probably shouldn't put words into 
her mouth either.  We should ask her, "Is what you meant....? If yes, the 
answer is....".  Personally, I find it a bit of a stretch to turn "type back 
and forth" into getting a Non-delivery notification....but as I said, I get 
many things wrong.

Ummmm.... I can't say for certain, but I _think_ you're going to have a
real uphill battle.  As a general rule it is often possible to salvage
deleted files from micros' hard drives using programs such as Norton
Utilities. 
However UNIX systems are quite another kettle of fish, with a _very_
different filing system; I don't think I've ever heard of such tools even
existing for them. 
I hope someone can offer more hopeful advice, but you may have to start
ringing data recovery services for advice/assistance.  (People will only
be able to suggest any to you if you send a mesage to the list saying
which country/area you're in though!)

i'm in Alaska, the US ...

but what i really wanted to know is if PINE OVERWRITES the data on
eXpunging - or does it merely remove the Inode data for a file ?

How does one suspend Pine?  I've always quitted before responding to a

Hi!

I've got some problems with my ISP and I'd like your opinion on this,
this is the situation:

I'm a PINE user from Norway (read: ex-PINE user). The problem is that my
ISP won't support PINE, their domain are having problems giving me
access to PINE. I've agrued with the for quite a while, trying to get my
PINE access back as I really like using PINE, simple and effective. When
I got my account they claimed to have a "Complete internet package" and
I assumed that I would be able to use PINE, but no, that's not the case.
My ISP claims that PINE is a professional program and I can't expect to
get access to this via my account. In my opinion is PINE not a
professional program, it's widely used among thousands of students all
around the world, and I won't claim that they're all professionals.

What's your opinion on this? Do you think it's unreasonable to claim
that to be able to use PINE should be included in a "complete intenret
package"?

Hope to hear from you!

Yours sincerely,

Lars Lordahl

    What _version_ of Pine are you configuring?  That can make some
difference in the options.

    The printer setting should not have anything to do with ISO-8859-1. 
As you have it there, I would think that Pine will handle Latin-1
messages just fine, provided there are in fact 8-bit characters in any
particular message.  (If there are not, then for that message Pine
"shifts down" and marks the message as US-ASCII.)

    With just this much, Pine will probably try to use Quoted-Printable
for sending 8-bit Latin-1 characters.  However, if your Pine version is
new enough (mine is 3.94), and if your mail transfer agent is capable
of Extended SMTP, you can instruct Pine to try to negotiate for
straight 8-bit transmission rather than use Q-P.  (If it cannot succeed
with the negotion, it will fall back to Q-P.)  In the feature-list, add
these two lines:

enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation
enable-8bit-nntp-posting

    With respect to newsgroups, be aware that the standard is still
7-bit, and not all newsgroup servers respect MIME headers.  Your users
may send a newsgroup posting with ISO-8859-1 8-bit characters and legal
MIME headers generated by Pine, but it is still possible for the
characters to get garbled by a server which does not respect MIME. 
There is not much you can do about this except try to get the whole
world to come up to the MIME standard.  (MIME, after all, is a standard
for _email_ extensions, not news.)

    You can do it four keystrokes (at least for deletion).  Go into
your personal configuration and enable-aggregate-command-set.  Read 
the online help about using aggregate commands.  Then, from an index
listing, to mark all message for deletion, enter the four keystrokes

LDAP is on our list of things to consider supporting, but we haven't

Make sure you enable the 'enable-suspend' in the Setup / Configuration 
section.  Then do a Ctrl-Z to suspend Pine, allowing you to start talking 
or whatever else you need to do.  Type 'fg' at the prompt when you want 
to return to Pine.

Some ISP's have Pine, some don't.  As far as I know (and hope, since I'm=20
shopping for a new ISP myself) is that you can install your own copy of=20
Pine in your account.

        talk is interactive.  talk is not email.  Try not to stretch 
meanings too much in order to make yourself "correct".

        MS-TNEF is a MicroSoft proprietary Rich Text format.  It is sent via 
MS Deranged (sometimes called MS-Exchange).  You will need that "program" to

Pine probably stores the retrieved article in a different dir than tin does.
Just tell Pine to use the same dir as tin does and all should be well.
Removing and compressing some files can help as well buying lager media.  ;-)

Ok, I can't read the news direct either, for some strange reason pine
seems to be assuming that the home directory of user 'ftp' is the
News directory (weird!) 

But I _can_ read news if I startup an IMAPd and make the news directory
'News *{localhost}[]' 

Problem is I can't post anything yet from pine ... 
I don't think its even looking for inews :-(

You want a small editor?  Well, DOS-Pine users may try "terse"
(terse12.zip on Simtel mirrors).  Small enough for ya?

Subject: cool thing for reading news groups with pine
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Message-ID: <E56psL.u8@nonexistent.com>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Date: Thu, 6 Feb 1997 20:17:03 GMT

I'm having fun converting a lot of my computing life to the world
of Windows 95 and I thought I'd let you all know this really cool
thing I'm doing for news reading.  

On the Start Menu I have an item called "Pine News Groups" with all
the news groups I regularly read as subitems.  For each news group
I have set it up to use a shortcut like this: 


 C:\Pine\PINE.EXE -f *{news.myisp.com/nntp}comp.mail.pine -Ii,;,a,a,d -sort OrderedSubj

(the above should be all on one line)

Then when I want to read that news group I just click the Start
Menu item that says comp.mail.pine and I'm in business.  The reason
that I use `-Ii,;,a,a,d' is because I want everything to
automatically be marked deleted.  Then when I'm done I just quit
that window and none of those messages show up again.  If there's a
message that I want to hang around I type `U' to undelete it.

The main drawback to using pine for reading news is that if the
news group has a LOT of unread message, it can take forever to open
and sort it.  But for groups that I read daily, and thus don't have
too many unread messages, it opens reasonably quickly.

You might be wondering why I don't use another news reader, like
Agent or NX or Netscape, and one of the main reasons is that I want
to be able to continue to save news messages in the same folders
that I save mail messages and I want these folders to be ascii so I
can open them in text editors, use grep on them, etc. 

I have a question for you all:  Does anyone know how to get the
titlebar of each Pine window to say what folder or news group it
has opened?  It's not uncommon for me to have 5 (or more!) pine
windows going and when I drag my cursor along the task bar they all
pop up the same message, i.e., `PC-Pine' -- I'd love it if it would
pop up `comp.mail.pine' or whatever folder is open. 

Thanks,
Nancy

I tried that, but it didn't work very well. First of all, when I tried to
view a HTML document, nothing happened (except that I got tons of files in
/tmp), and second of all, when I tried to start lynx from the command
line, it spawned of hundreds of sessions, and the only way to stop it was
to remove the .mailcap entry.

Still open for suggestions, though.

type:

*if* that's where your mailfolder is. If it isn't, try typing:

	mail

(which can be left by typing "q" >;->).
Maybe some filtering program is running of which pine hasn't been "made
aware" (i.e. whose folders it cannot find at the moment).

Isn't there a way to use pine for Win95 just to send mails?

I try to send a message, and it says:

[Can't send message without an open remote folder]

I don't have access to a IMAP server. I tried to put 
{pine.cac.washington.edu:144/anonymous}#news.updates.pine395
as my inbox path. The folder opens ok, but the message still
come up.

If pine for Win95 can't really work, do you know another MUA that 
supports customized header (like "Approved:").

TIA, Roberto

Choose option "E" to export that message.  You then have to specify the
name and directory to save that file.  It will be saved as text file.

Good luck,

Try E(xport) instead of S(ave).

Yes. From .pinerc:

# List of directories where saved-message folders may be. First one is
# the default for Saves. Example: Main {host1}mail/[], Desktop mail\[]
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}optnl-directory-path[]
#incoming-folders={ibm.rhrz.uni-bonn.de/pop3}inbox
  
And from pine's q&a:
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
  As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
  Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the message
  INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax
  {pop3server/pop3}INBOX
                   
  where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server.
  
  However, this method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in
  offline mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3
  server with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New,
  Answered, Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
  As an alternative, a program such as popclient can be used to download
  email from a POP server to a local Unix account, where it can then
  be accessed with Pine. One location from which popclient can be obtained
  is:
         ftp://ftp.mal.com/pub/pop/
         
  Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP or
  IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
  more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
  Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
     http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

Dunno. ;-)

  						^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At least "copiousoutput" *might* suck:

       needsterminal 
        If this flag is given, the named interpreter needs to interact with
	the user on a terminal. In some environments (e.g. a window-oriented
	mail reader under X11) this will require the creation of a new
	terminal emulation window, while in most environments it will not.
	If the mailcap entry specifies "needsterminal" and metamail is not
	running on a terminal (as determined by isatty(3), the -x option,
	and the MM_NOTTTY environment variable) then metamail will try to
	run the command in a new terminal emulation window. Currently,
	metamail knows how to create new windows under the X11, SunTools,
	and WM window systems.

       copiousoutput 
        This flag should be given whenever the interpreter is capable of
	producing more than a few lines of output on stdout, and does no
	interaction with the uer. If the mailcap entry specifies
	copiousoutput, and pagination has been requested via the "-p"
	command, then the output of the command being executed will be piped
	through a pagination program ("more" by default, but this can be
	overridden with the METAMAIL_PAGER environment variable).
             
Now, copiousoutput seems unneccessary with lynx. So I dropped it and ended
up with this entry:
	
# In the samples given   test=test -n "$DISPLAY"   is used to determine if
# the current session is X capible by checking for the existance of a
# DISPLAY environment variable.
#
# any system (VMS included) without the DISPLAY environment variable
# will be assumed to be Non-X

[..]

# A common problem with the mailcap mechanism is getting differential
# behavior from different programs. This problem is compounded by the fact
# that some programs, notably Mosaic, do not implement the "test" clause in
# mailcap files. If you are using Lynx and X Mosaic together you should
# place all X-centric entries before non-X entries. X Mosaic will use
# whichever entry is defined first so further entries will be ignored.
#
# Lynx exports the environment variable LYNX_VERSION, so if you wish to test
# if Lynx is running or not you can use 'test -n "LYNX_VERSION"'

	test=test -z "$DISPLAY" -a -z "$LYNX_VERSION"; needsterminal
	text/html; lynx  -force_html %s; needsterminal;

The following is, of course, from my .pinerc (I forgot to mention that, but
you sure knew...).

Hello,

Is there a command in pine to "reload" a user's INBOX (or whatever the
currently selected folder is for that matter)?  In other words, I'm
looking for a way to clear away the messages marked for deletion without
actually having to quit and restart pine. 

Thanks,

Joshua Lerner

Joshua:

Very simple to do.  Mark your messages for deletion by pressing the "D"
key.  When you are ready to delete them, press "X".  This expunges them
from the folder you are currently in, and refreshes the list.

The aggregate command set is another good tool to use in conjunction with
this.  In the Pine configuration screen (from main menu press "S" and
"C"), press the "?" when you have "enable-aggregate-command-set"
highlighted.  It will explain how this feature works.

Hope this helps!

The command you're looking for is call X(punge). Be careful, though, when
using it on u*ix machines, because it's almost impossible to "undelete"
expunged messages. A combination of the following is a nice way to wreak
havoc on your inbox, so make sure you *know* what you're doing. 

            [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set
            [X]  expunge-without-confirm
                        
Further help is available within pine's S(etup) C(config) (where you can set
these values), and the information available at:

	http://www.washington.edu/pine

Make sure to read that, too.


Cheers,
Robin

Hit x when you're looking at the index of messages in that folder.

When attempting to post a followup to an article where the poster has
specified Followup-to: poster, PINE (the version I'm using says it's
3.95a) automatically creates an email reply, without giving the
opportunity to post to the newsgroup (as well or instead).  Is there a
way to intervene in this?

One doesn't always want to limit further discussion to private email,
even if the original poster wanted it so.  I tried the related help, but
it didn't seem to throw light on this question.

Hi There,
I use pine quite a bit, but I've been having a problem lately where it
hangs when doing network activity.  For example, usually when posting a
message.  I expect the server that impad is running on is under heavy
load, but isn't there any timeout?  It's very frustrating writing a long
message and then having to kill pine because it's just sitting there.  I
once left pine running all night to see if it would eventually time out -
nope - still said "Busy" and was "spinning" in the morning...

Also, are there any places with user patches/upgrades for pine?  I've
written a small one that just adds a couple of features and changes the
default behaviour of pine, but I've got a lot more I'd like to do.  I
figured I better check to see if someone allready did something like it...

Thanks,
	Rick

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  ***THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT TELLS HOW YOU CAN HELP MAKE
A         POSITIVE IMPACT ON AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS***

IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE REPRESENTING YOU AND 
YOUR FAMILIES RIGHTS IN WASHINGTON, THEN THIS MESSAGE IS FOR YOU!

My name is Justin Eichenlaub and I am working to start to mobilize and
on-line movement to encourage the Congress of the United States of
America to pass "true" campaign finance reform.  For those of you who
have never heard of this issue before, it mainly deals with changing
laws so that there is a limit on the amount of money that can be given
to political campaigns and the amount of money that can be spent.  For
more information log onto my web sight at: 
http://www.angelfire.com/pa/financereform
I am not asking you to become a major player in this effort where a lot
of work and time will be expected, in fact the requirement to be a part
of this revolution in American politics is very infantile.  The minimum
that we are asking you to do to support our cause is to send at least
one letter to your congressional representative and senators, and
encourage anyone you know on the Internet or at home, on the job, or in
school to do the same.

If you prefer this letter can be personally written by you as long as
you feel that you have read up on the issue and are well-informed enough
to make certain statements and have the knowledge to back them up.  I
you are not too sure, or just don't feel that you have the time but
would still like to partake, then a type of form letter will be supplied
to you to print out and merely plug in your address and name into the
letter.

This relatively easy and great way to spread our concerns will work only
if you agree to give up a small amount of your time to take part in the
free democracy that many men and women have died to retain for our
country.

If you are interested, simply send this e-mail back to me and we will be
in contact with you.  My e-mail is JUTMAN@VELOCITY.NET

Thank you very much for your time, and I hope that you seriously
consider the benefits of your participation.

Sincerely,

Justin Eichenlaub

Hi all,

I have the following question :

Suppose I am reading a mail using Pine on the window #1 and then
I start a new Pine on window #2, the first Pine give the message=20
"[Another Pine is accessing Inbox.  Session now Read-Only.]", Ok.
Now, I quit Pine on window #2 but my Pine #1 stays allways in
Read Only state. Is there a way to turn it "read-Write" without
quit Pine.

TIA

JEAN

	I am part of a very long list (very, very, long list), and when I
read mail from it, 95% of the message is taken up by the header "TO:" with
all the names and addresses of the list.  What do I do so that Pine does
not display the header "TO:"?

					Thanks in advance.

It is indeed quite possible to combine two (or more) messages in order to
operate on them (eg, forward them all on as one message; print them out;
save them (as separate messages) to another folder; delete them; etc).

You do this by first making sure you have some additional commands
available to you...

1.	Start Pine and go to the Setup Configuration screen.

2.	Look for the "enable-aggregate-command-set" variable, and make
	sure it is selected (has an "X" next to it).

3.	Exit the Setup Configuration screen, saving any changes you made.

Now go to the Index screen of the folder containing the messages you want
to select and work on.  Once there...

4.	Use the now-available Select (;) command to pick the messages you
	want to work on.  After typing the ";" command check the menu at
	the bottom of the screen for the various ways of picking
	messages.  If you just have a couple use "C" (or Return) to pick
	the current message.

5.	Selected messages are shown either in bold or with an "X" at the
	beginning of their line (depending on settings in your Setup
	Configuration screen).  Now you need to operate on your selected
	messages...

6.	Use the Apply (A) command to indicate you want to operate on all
	the selected messages (instead of just the current one).  Having
	given the Apply command check the command menu at the bottom of
	the screen to see what commands are available.

Cheers,

        The problem is that you can tell pine not to display the To: line on 
a per message basis.  So, you could turn of the To: like but it would be off 
for all messages.  I don't know if you'd want that behaviour.

        Maybe you could convince the sender to fix their way of sending so 
that the Loooonnnnnnnggggg To: doesn't come out that way?

        Nope, there is no way to currently reconnect Window#1.  The best 
thing you can do is quit Window #1 and proceed in Window #2.  Actually, the 
best thing you can do is not to try starting a second pine unless you tell 
it a specific folder (not INBOX) to start in.

A better solution (one that will help everyone who receives the message,
not just yourself) is to ask the people who send out the message to
distibute it by listing the recipients' e-mail addresses in the "Bcc:"
field rather than the "To:" field.

This will hide the list of recipients in each delivered copy of the
message.

Note that it is highly advisable to include at least one valid e-mail
address in the "To:" field when using using "Bcc:".  Otherwise some mail
delivery programs continue to list all the recipients as a series of
"Apparently-to:" headers.  (Sigh.)

Cheers,

To mark all messages as havine been read:

	; A A * ! N		(Select All Apply Flag Not New)

Note that for this to work you need the "enable-aggregate-command-set" 
variable set (to give you the Select command) and also the
"enable-flag-cmd" variable (to give you the Flag (*) command).

Hmmmm.... we see this "perpetually spinning busy cursor" on _some_ of our
SGI IRIX systems (but not on others).  My suspicion is that the different
patches that have been applied to the various systems probably accounts
for the discrepancy.

For us a workaround is to set the "disable-busy-alarm" feature in the
systemwide configuation file for Pine.  This disables the spinning "busy"
alarm and things work just fine.

Gut feeling is that there is some sort of "negative interaction" going on
between the once-a-second alarm timer responsible for spinning the busy
cursor and the networking code.

I've reported the problem to the Pine Team, but given it only appears to
happen on _some_ of our IRIX systems and no-one else seems to have
mentioned it (until now?) it's difficult to do anything about.

Give it a try and see if it works for you or not.  (And perhaps report the
results of your test here?)

Cheers,

IMVHO, this problem is calling for a filtering program. The simplest
solution would be to check the mail for a regexp containing the name of the
list and strip the rest of the to: field. You might also cat it into the
body of the message so that you can still see who the message was intended
to got to, too.

Check Nancy McGough's filtering FAQ at:
	http://www.jazzie.com/ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/
        http://www.best.com/~ii/faqs/archive/mail/filtering-faq/
                    
In this case, I'd strongly suggest using procmail >;->, but that's just my
personal opinion.

Apart from that: Why are you sending mails with more than one cc: / bcc: --
that's not what a "list" is for, is it?

Cheers,
Robin

One quick fix is this.  The Eudora Light POP3 Mail client (freeware, I
believe) will encode/decode MIME and BinHex.  But I'd imagine that there
must be other shareware or freeware based codecs around.  A quick search
in Yahoo or Excite should turn up something.

Hope this helps!

Thanks for this informative reply.  But, one thing I didn't get was how 
to save the messages seperately after they have been fowarded as one message.

	I'm assuming the 3D= isn't actually there, are you using the
cc that came with SCO's DEV kit, or are you using a renamed GCC?  I
had problems with SCO's cc, however PINE had no probelms with GCC
2.7.2.  Of course, getting GCC 2.7.2 was a total pain, but so far it
has been worth it.

 I think that we need version of pine which supports Unicode.
I mean if we use terminal which displays Unicode translated glyphs in UTF8
for example then pine could use this kind of terminal and properly display
multilingual mail.

 In the Main menu type '?', it will show you basic help. You can omit first

You might try http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine/.

Also, there is a home-brewed Pine tutorial at
http://www.burlco.lib.nj.us/tutorial/pinemail.html.  It's been slightly
customized for use here at the library, but 99% of it is still useful.

There are two Mac utilities called binhex and hexbin available on the
internet. Those are for LinuX, so you should be able to run them on your
system as soon as you've installed LinuX on your system (which is a good
idea, anyway, because a PC is a terrible thing to waste... >;-> ). 

I do suspect, though, that a similar util is available for Dos95, too, so
check www.yahoo.com (for example).

Viewing the files is a different matter. There's viewing software galore
again at yahoo. You might run into trouble if your friend has used some
fancy Mac format for the files, too.

Apart from that, don't you two have access to an ftp-server? Cause that's
where those files belong, actually (correct me if I'm wrong, pls).

  >My net server is Netcom, I can use Netscape or Microsoft exchange as the

If at all, your mailer should be able to handle those. SM-exchange and
Netscape are no mailers, I think - or are they? ;->

Whoa... are you trying to do two different things in one go?

If you want to include two or more messages in a reply/forwarded message
then the "Select messages, Apply a Reply or Forward" to them is just what
you want.

However replying/forwarding is simply you sending a message to someone; it
doesn't save anything anywhere (unless, of course, you have set Fcc: to
file a copy somewhere, in which case (as usual) an exact copy of the
message you sent gets stored).

If you want to save the messages (as separate items) to another folder
then you still use the "Select messages, Apply..." trick, but in this case
you Apply a "Save" (S) command to them.

Whilst Applying a Forward or Reply joins the selected message into one
(you can only be actively composing one message at a time, which is why
this happens) Applying a Save keeps the messages as separate items as they
are moved into the destination folder.

So to save messages to a different folder:

	; <criterion>		...Select the messages
	A S foldername		...Apply a Save command to put them into
				   a specified folder

Cheers,

I see it on our HP system as well as on a Solaris box, but only when I run
Pine3.95 not when I run Pine3.91, which I still preserve.

I can't find "disable-busy-alarm" in my Pine configurations; How do you
set it?

Hi Jean,

I had the same problem (actually I kept forgetting that I left pine with
Ctrl-Z ;) but couldn't find any good solution.

The final trick to solve this irritating problem was that instead of
starting pine, I start a small and primitive script that does the job for
me.


------Begin of script spine -----
#! /bin/sh
#  exec pine only if not already running or a lock file exists
if [ ! -e "<lock_file_name>" ]; then
=09exec pine "-d0 -z -I l" $@
    exit 5  #
else
=09echo 'Another Pine Session already running ... exiting'
fi
----End of script -----


Now, the idea is to identify the lock file usually at /tmp/ just look
around when you're in Pine and it won't take too long before you'll know
which one is yours.=20

Then "brutally" put the full path of the file into the script, "et voila"
it won't come up if you're already open once.

I'm not a Unix Guru, so I guess it can be done better, but since it
works..... :)

All the Best,
  Naor

There are some commercially supported ports; but for a free version, see
Andy Harper's developments at ftp2.kcl.ac.uk in directory ZIP (use a
conventional FTP client for this, and id anonymous).

For some background you might start with my own notes at
http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/vms-pine.html

There's a new version (3.91 beta 11) just out - I haven't tried it yet
but it sounds real good.

Joe,

Just add "disable-busy-alarm" to your feature list (/local/lib/pine.conf,
or ~/.pinerc should work too).  I've turned it off, and so far it's
working great (thanks Mike!).  It really didn't help much anyway...

I added it on a line by itself, but it didn't make a difference.

Thank you for the reply anyway,

Jean, 
We don't happen to use Berkeley folder format anymore (and this locking
behavior is a function of the driver for that format), so I can't test
this, but I *thought* you could go to the folder list and select INBOX and
re-open... then again, maybe that only works if it was closed due to an
access error.

Note also that you can start the second session with the -o flag so that
it won't disturb the first session.

    Quite seriously, the best thing you can do is instruct whoever is
sending you this monster how to do it right in the first place, so that
you don't have the problem.  With a list of addressees this long, the
sender should not put everydody's address in To:.  Teach the sender how
to use Bcc:, which should be available with most mail agents, Pine and
otherwise.  In such a case, the sender should not leave To: completely
blank: there are a couple of tricks to use, depending on the sender's
mail agent.  (Late versions of Pine and possibly other mail agents also
have an Lcc: option which can be used.)

    I am serious -- this should not be your problem.  The sender should
change his/her ways.  After all, if you disable seeing To: for this,
you will probably disable seeing it for all messages, which you may not
want.  The real problem is on the other end with a sender who does not
know how to do things properly.

Date: 8 Feb 1997 21:31:57 GMT
Message-ID: <01bc1608$718ac300$269dc2d0@stevekre>

I just started a new job where I have a dedicated ISDN line to access the
Internet. Unfortunately, we do not have a news feed from our ISP. But, the
ISP I use from home does. It was suggested that I use PC Pine to access my
NNTP server from work.

So, I located, downloaded and installed PC Pine on my machine at work (BTW,
the PC Pine .ZIP file from TUCOWS would not unpack itself). After a few
minutes of fiddling I got the mail portion of PC Pine to work correctly. I
can send and receive mail without a problm. But, no news. I downloaded my
newsrc from my home account and put it in the same dir as PC Pine and
entered the path in the pinerc but no go.

Any ideas regarding what I have to do to get PC Pine to retrieve news?

    You can do something in Pine which may accomplish the same purpose. 
In the addressbook, when you set up an alias (or nickname) for someone,
you can specify Fcc for that recipient.  You can use any legal folder
name that does not conflict with some already existing folder -- unless
you deliberately want to store outgoing mail from more than one person
in the same folder.  Then, when you want to send mail to someone, use
the nickname on the To: line of the headers, and Pine will
automatically save that message in the particular folder you specified
in the addressbook for that person.  (If you wish, you may change it at
the last minute for any single message.)

Which is good, because there are Macutils available for that. Check
www.yahoo.com for binhex and hexbin. That should be all you need.

BinHex usually is for Macintosh files.
Unless it contains just data (text) you should transfer it to a Mac
on drop it onto StuffItExpander (currently at version 4.0.2).

But you can convert BinHex with mcvert - see page
http://trurl.npac.syr.edu/SGIfreeware/mcvert.html

You could get yourself Executor, the infamous Mac-Emulator... That one has

When replying to a message, and killing quoted text, sometimes I
accidentally hit ^J (Justify) instead of ^K (Kill).  They are, after
all, right next to each other.  B-(  Under some mailreaders, no big
deal, I wind up with a sloppy-looking mess... but under Pine, it seems
to go into an infinite loop, tacking on more and more lines with nothing
but the quote marker (the other guy's userid plus a bracket), and not
stopping until it runs out of room!  Usually I first get sick of it and
"kill -9" it from another window!

Other than typing more carefully, upgrading (which, not being the
sysadmin, I don't think I am authorized to do), using an alternate
editor (I hate vi with a passion and xemacs takes forever to load), or
using an alternate mailreader (Netscape hangs on the way into news and
elm threw several hissyfits before I gave up), is there anything I can
do to avoid this? 

(On a related note, is there some way to get it to take just the first
LETTER of the userid, or maybe of each dot-separated word, or maybe the
first letter of each word in the "real name or stupid comment" part,
rather than the whole darn userid?  I didn't see anything relevant in
the setup-config screens, but maybe I missed something....)

How can I send to multiple addresses on one message? I can only see how to
write to one address... is there a way to do it from the address book?

You can separate the addresses with commas.  You can either use the full 
addresses, or the nicknames (if you've set them up in your Addressbook).  

If you frequently want to send mail to several addresses, you can create 
a Distribution List for them.  Go to the Addressbook and type 'S' to 
create it...it will prompt you for the details.

       I don't know who you are, nor you me, and I am really glad I don't 
know you.  All I did was ask for some assistance, not your snide remarks.
I have my preferences and you have yours.  You had no right lashing out 
at me, or telling me what kind of operating system I should be using. I 
hope you're not this unprofessional all the time.

Hi,
if I try to add the following header to my customized-hdrs, it will be
splited up into several headers, and the resulting mails gets very messed
up:

X-Face: R;!k)O*@?2ak[7XB&6G=YljP?tdH5hcAG?N%AeX0.|$B)k^2$;@0>0I4P<L<X:Tf_Im!<1z
 A$'>suSO0cX[#~rN<p]nTa^+={J'L((0bU2CNXnq+ltoF+tDo4|h5xr]8'd~K"iw`x{`x1t{rgtT0v
 T1kI_+U`n7Wv}tGIecGtth37=}jCUvs-w\s6y`M!A$vMyoRh&5vPH0ozIjnoy7C((pbE;-%D}[.d+"
 &?x^QhM:|],div9#m'#]86%XXp1nhrqh1lB|kPo;.K0A4m|Lg)7T}Ag`4dQ`7Q7c0x|mg/!HF^Y/P:
 TyF,bY0!Yu[{LILz%t"`Lsj+}SFS>.fdOaNFc_sA)Qq"BA

I think the problem is that the configfile uses the ,-sign as a separater
and sinc my headder contains that sign it will be separated. The easy
solution to this would be to introduce a characetr sequence that will be
translated into ,-signs after the parsing of the config file.

Regarding my posting about trying the "disable-busy-alarm" configuration
setting if you're experiencing hangs in Pine with a perpetually spinning
"busy cursor"...

The "disable-busy-alarm" item is a hidden configuration option for, I
guess, debugging tests (possibly in response to my original bug report).

It doesn't have a user-interface in the Setup Configuration screen and so
cannot be set from there.

Instead you must edit your Pine settings file ($HOME/.pinerc for UNIX
Pine) and add this to the list of values of the "feature-list" variable.
(Simply adding "disable-busy-alarm" by itself any old place in the file
won't work.)

Cheers,

Dear Tracey A. Gaulrapp,

don't we all sometimes sit down and wonder what all these funny little signs
on that big square thing in front of us mean?

Now, in this case it might have been helpful to think about these letters:

dkrull@prairienet.org

Doesn't ring a bell? Thought so... My my, were we getting kicks out of
flaming people without thinking first, hm? Now, here's a bit out of the

that happen to appear now and then...

Enough of that... Next time you flame a person, make sure you hit the right
one. Ceterum censeo that dkrull@prairienet.org (Don Krull) is a show-off
who's trying to impress people with half-digested snippets from third class

    Granted, to some extent this may be a matter of personal taste and
operating style, but I also find this change in Pine to be thoroughly
obnoxious.  Particularly because of the way I handle newsgroups, the
new style in Pine is just plain clumsy.  Having a configuration option
as to which way you want Pine to work would be far, far better.  (They
have the code to do it both ways because they have _done_ it both
ways.)  After all, one may now specify the screen overlap in the viewer.

Message-ID: <5dnhud$oj1@opus.intellistor.com>

I am having a problem with Pine running on a system
that uses Multiview for multi-screen capability on
a dumb terminal (wyse60/50).

Multiview puts a single menu line at the bottom
of each screen.  That appears to be messing up
Pine, particularly on the Compose screen.

Anyway to convince Pine not to use all 24 lines?

Hello,
 Thinking of using 'procmail' as my mail filter with Pine 3.95 as the mail
client.

If anyone out there has any experience with this combination, I would
appreciate it if you could share your experiences/any special 'gotchas', etc?
How would you recommend I start off?

Thanks a lot,
--Vikas

Let me add my vote here too :-) I too  find this feature/bug totally
irritating. 

I frequently use Pine by dialing up to my Unix box, and running a
VT100/Telnet emulator, which you can imagine is quite slow. And mind you, I
have to be *very* careful about hitting keys when I am on a modem connection
because the screen updates lag my typing *by far* !

To get around this, I do the following: I 'D'elete the last message in the
folder index and Lo and Behold, Pine 3.95 now scrolls the entire screen ! Now
I <Up> arrow to the previous message and 'U'ndelete it! All this stupid motion
just to scroll the screen. I wish there were a option to allow us to scroll to
next/previouspage when the cursor down/up beyond the last/first message!

Mark, Terry, Dave..,.. please accomodate us..

Thanks,
--Vikas

My case is slightly different, in which messages take a relatively long
tome to get posted, up to three to five minutes before I regain control.
I still have Pine3.91 on the system and when I run it messages get posted
without any delay.

I did just that after Rick Byers kindly explained it on this list, but it
did not make a difference in the performance of my Pine3.95 on HP system.
I also run Pine 3.95 on a Solaris box, having the same problem.  I run it
on a BSDI box without any problem.  Options and features are set the same
way across these three platforms, yet this problem only appears on HP and 
Solaris.

I read a message on this list dating January 27 describing the exact 
problem:

I hope someone on the list solves this problem, otherwise I'll have to
revert back to Pine3.91.

Thanks for your help,

Does any know of or use a Spell Checker that integrates nicely with

Ummm....  Am I missing something here?  Wouldn't it just be easier to use
the "scroll by a screenful" commands? ...

	Space Bar	... scroll forward a screenful
	-		... scroll back a screenful

These keys can be used in most places (Index screen, when reading a
message, Setup Configuration screen, etc).

In case some people don't know, there's also a couple of commands for
going straight to the top or bottom of a message/index screen/etc:

	^W ^Y		... Go to first line
	^W ^V		... Go to last line

Given the above commands the "drive the cursor into the margin to give
small amounts of scrolling" is a quite useful addition, rather just
duplicating the effect of the above keystrokes (at least, I think so:-)

Cheers,

I am using UNIX pine, version 3.91, and I was wondering if anyone knew 
how to set the program to always CC: a particular address (a default CC:, 
if you will).

thanks for any help in advance,

Yes.. I know these commands. The thing is the following: When I do <Space> at
the last message on a given screen, it takes me to the next message *and*
scrolls the screen down 1 screenful. So far so good, but now (cursor is on top
of screen) when I do a '-', it scrolls back 1 screen but also the first
message in the previous screen is made the current message and not the message
prior to the earlier message which the <Up> cursor key would do. 

I hope I made sense :-) But as I said, it is a minor irritation and one that I
can live with. I just dont get why doing 'D'elete on the last message should
scroll forward one but <Down> will not ! A tad inconsistent, wouldnt you say?

Maybe you need to set TERM (upcase)?  Is vt102 defined in the termcap?
Do the docs to your terminal program say that it will understand it?

I'm confused.  Has no one noticed that if you use "N" and "P" to navigate,
you (still) get the old behavior, and only if you use "^N" and "^P" or
the arrow keys do you get the "new" behavior?  In other words, now you
have a choice...  So what am I missing?

> Mark, Terry, Dave..,.. please accomodate us..

Actually, neither Mark, Terry, nor David are the actual Pine authors --but
we are all friends of the actual Pine authors (who are either too smart or
too busy working on the next release to be sending much pine-info mail! :)

Excuse the fake address, but I have the same problem, but I would like 
to know if PINE can block future messages from spammers?  I have been 
receiving messages from the same addresses even after I have requested 
removal from their lists.  And, if the the rejected mail could be sent 
back with message explaining the rejection, so much the better.  I know 
the spammer could simply change the sending address, but I would hope it 
would be too much work for too little return.

Thanks

Oops! Major egg-on-face here. Terry.. you are right. I just never tried N or
P before even though it is right in front of my eyes. I just used the arrow
keys.. Sorry for complaining before doing everything I could. I dont usually
do this.

Procmail is quite a monster, but once tamed will give a plethora of
wonderful toys. Read the man pages (procmail and procmailrc) -- if you're
any good at programming those will be all you need for now. If you want more
than "basic" stuff, be sure to join the mailing list (which is really,
really good) and read some of the many faqs that are available on the net.
Start with Nancy McGoughs Filtering-FAQ.

Hi!

When I use Pine on a remote terminal I cannot enter certain characters.
(I don't have these problems with other progs, such as elm.)

Is this a problem with termcaps? I've set "term" to vt102.
The terminal programm I am using is Minicom 1.71 under Linux.

Any help is very much appreciated.

  Jens

That message means that alpha6 does not have an IMAP service

The UW IMAP server is invoked from inetd; I don't know about other
servers...

Well, rot13 is very simple - see "script" in my sig.
You can use it as a filter - just pipe the mail to it.

This is the way it was defined.  Thus it's not a bug but a feature.

It turns out that this information is a carefully-guarded state secret...

Of course not. It's a mailing program, not an augury. It's not a filtering
program, either. One of those can be used, to pre-process mail before you
get to read it in pine. Get Nancy McGough's filtering FAQ for the details.

Take a look at the Spam FAQ for a definition of "spam" --- afaik, it's _not_
what you're describing here.

Check Doug Muths "forrep"-script. It's available at your local
procmail-dealer.

Work? Where? >;-> Make sure to get the Net-Abuse FAQ, too. Read it
*carefully* and *thoroughly*. Make sure to read the other FAQs that are
mentioned there, too. And PLEASE don't use silly gimmicks like your fake
address if you expect an answer from people, because it's more than
annoying.

Ah, this is a different case (different time (at posting), and it does
eventually return).

I _think_ the delay you are seeing is more to do with some additional
checking code introduced in Pine 3.95 (can anyone on the Pine Team confirm
this, and what it does?)

Have a look at Pine's Release Notes ("R" at the Main Menu, and search ("W"
command) for "background" (there are several instances).  This describes
the *EXPERIMENTAL* "Background Sending" feature new to Pine 3.94 onwards.

Note that you will probably have to recompile your Pine after uncommenting
the "BACKGROUND_POST" definitions in your pine/osdep/os-XXX.h header file
in order to make this feature available (if, indeed, it is supported on
your platform).

Worth a look...

Cheers,

Or use the '-o' option on the second pine, it doesn't grab the lock then.

Perhaps I'd better confess that I've never noticed this difference either!
I've always assumed that Cursor Up/Down were synonymous with P/N.  Now it
has been pointed out, however, it becomes obvious (as most things do).
Cursor Up/Down are actually synonymous with ^P/^N, not P/N.

By the way, Vikas, are you familiar with the "Jump" command and (more
usefully) its shortcut? ...

If you want to leap to a particular message in the Index screen (or even
when reading a message) you can type "J" followed by the message number.
The shortcut (available if you have set the "enable-jump-shortcut"
setting) lets you omit the initial "J" and just type the message number.

This can be handy for quickly moving the highlight from, say, a message at
the top of the screen in the Index listing to one at the bottom.

[Apologies if you already knew of this!  (However some others may not, I
guess.)]

Cheers,

Certainly with the current version of Pine (3.95) there is an item in the
Setup Configuration screen called "customized-hdrs".  This allows you to
add extra (custom) headers with, if you wish, default values.  It can, I
believe, also be used to give default values to already existing headers
(such as the "Cc:" header).

However whether this facility is available in the ancient version 3.91 of
Pine you are using I cannot recall.  (Any chance of upgrading?  There are
many new features and bug-fixes.)

By the way, if you are planning on always Cc'ing a copy to _yourself_ a
better solution would be to use "Fcc:" rather than "Cc:".  Instead of
taking an e-mail address "Fcc:" wants the name of one of your folders.
Whenever you send a message with an "Fcc: foldername" set a copy of the
message is written straight into that folder.  This avoids the
(unnecessary) delay and overhead of sending a copy to yourself through the
mail system only to have it arrive back in your INBOX.

If you want to use "Fcc:" you can set its default value using the
"default-fcc" variable in the Setup Configuration screen.

You can also do snazzy things like tell Pine's Address Book to use a
different Fcc folder when sending a message to someone listed in your
Address Book (providing theirs is the first e-mail address in the "To:"
field).

Again, note that these options _may_ not be available in Pine 3.91 (I
honestly can't recall).

Cheers,

    This sounds like a problem with the version of Pine you are using. 
I am on version 3.94, and when I pressed 'R' to make a reply to your
post, Pine presented me with three standard choices (as it always
does):

1.  Post a followup to newsgroup;
2.  Reply to author by email;
3.  Do both at the same time.

I never had to do anything to get this behavior: it is automatic.

Hi,
I've troubles sending mails from PC-Pine (3.95 (BETA) under WinNT3.51).
Every time I try to send outside of my domain, I got the error:

[Mail not send: sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed rcpthosts
(#5]

Running "pine 3.95 for Unix" onto my Sun works perfectly. The
interesting thing for me is, that I didn't get any logging information
from QMail and IMAPD if I try to send from the PC (syslog). 

The posting within my domain works fine, as well as reading of the
incomming messages. BTW: If I try to send to a foreign domain (which
fails) I'm not able to enter sentences in *one* line. Every time a press
'space', a newline is generated...:-( (if I send within my domain,
there's no problem)

Here's my configuration:
QMail 0.95 Server runnning onto SunOS4.1.3_U1
IMAPD distributed with Pine 3.95
PC-Pine 3.95 (beta, 15-Jul-96) running under WinNT3.51 patchlevel 4


Hope you can help me out.

Best regards,
Dietmar

I am using Pine 3.91. When I try to forward my mail to multiple accounts,
it doesn't work.

I have this in my .forward file:

username is for local host, username2 is alternate location

\username,username@domain.com

Could this be something the administrators on my network have done or do I
have to use procmail or something?

Actually, it sounds more like a problem of _your_ version :-) RFC1036 (if
I remember the number right) states, that if Followup-To: contains single
word "poster", any followup should be mailed to athor's address and _not_
posted. So Pine 3.95 is quite correct on that matter.

Extract from Pine's "man" page:

          -f folder           Open folder (in first defined folder
                              collection) instead of INBOX.

Thus:

	pine -f foldername

or, for IMAP connections with most shells:

	pine -f '{imap.yoursite.domain}foldername'

From what I have read, it appears that Imap 4 and pine should get along but I
was curious if anyone out there is already running this combination.

If so, have you run into any problems or conflicts?

More specifics: We are presently running Pine 3.93 using Imap version 2 on AIX
3.2.5. My co-worker wants to upgrade us to Imapd version 4.

Thanks!

Does anyone know how to prevent a message from being forwarded? Is there
a way to control this on a per-message basis, or is it a feature which can
be set/unset? We use v3.91 here, so it may be in a later version; if so
please let me know which.

Thanx to all in advance!

        OK, first of all there is no relationship to the operation of the 
.forward and that of pine.  They are independent.

        When you say, it "doesn't work", you don't tell us what the failure 
mode is.  Do you get a copy at "username" but not username@domain.com?  What 
exactly is the failure mode.

        I would suggest that you have 2 lines in your .forward file.

\usermaname
username@domain.com

        *and* that you ensure your .forward is world readable.  Meaning if 
you do an "ls -l .forward" you see something like -rw-r--r-- for the 
permissions.

        Regards,

Running PC-Pine 3.92 under Windows NT 3.51/4.0:

Is it possible to configure Pine so that when one "replies" to a message
they will ONLY reply to the sender and not the CC:.  I understand that
you can be prompted to not "reply to all"....However, I would like the
default to be NOT reply to all without prompting.

I realize this is an unusual request...Your help is greatly appreciated.

Yes it is, and I will look into it and send my results to the list.

Greetings.. again!

I'm running PINE 3.95 OS/2 version.. using POP/3 - 
Using OS/2 Warp ver.# 3.00 (Red Spine) - Latest PPP/IAK - 
(IDENT is running) - 486dx2/66 - etc..

In the beginning I was able to poll two different servers for
my e-mail.. also could read/post to newsgroups.. it started by
after being PINE for a period of time.. my INBOX would be closed
and a message stating it was due to "access error". This would 
close only my INBOX.. newsgroups still worked. Then I started being
kicked out of PINE.. after reading a few groups/messages.. with the

error message: "Process Terminated by SIGDEV"

Now.. PINE will not even attempt to connect.. read msgs/poll.. etc..
it kicks me out immediately with a new error message:

"Process Terminated by SIGSEV"
"SYS1808: The Process has Stopped. The Software diagnostic code  
(Exception Code) is 0005"

And that's where I'm stuck.. weird.. huh? Needless to say.. any
forthcoming assistance.. would be sincerely appreciated.

No problem. First, choose View Attachment (V) then highlight the attachment
you want to export. Choose Save, and Pine will ask you what filename you want
to save the file under (it may default to the file's actual .DOC name). At
that point, you will have a copy of the file available for export in either
your home directory, or your current working directory, depending on how your
configuration is setup.

Good luck,
Joe DiBenedetto

Try putting one of these lines at the end of your .forward file:

yourname@your.machine
yourname@localhost

Or you can put a script as one of the addresses, like this

| script.pl

Which will append standard input to some file, and tell your pine that this
file is your inbox.

    You are not alone in striking adjacent keys and having something
occur other than what you intended.  Happens all the time to me. 
However, you might want to consider the alternate editor feature again. 
There _are_ other editors available than vi and its offspring and
various incarnations of Emacs.

   For example, I use Joe, which I consider an "intermediate" editor 
in between the primitiveness of the Pine composer and the horrors of
vi/Emacs.  And it is configurable, so you can rebind keystrokes to your
pleasure if you don't like the defaults that come with it.  (It even
comes with a "SuperPico" emulation.)  I have a pointer to it on my home
page.  I'm no hotshot Un*x programmer, but it compiled first time for
me right out of the box (then I discovered my ISP already supplied
it).

Ah!  Thanks.  I understand that now, and it tidies up the groups
lists nicely.

OK.

So, reading the groups is more convenient when configured in
the way you describe; but I still haven't been able to post to
the groups that aren't on the default server (the one configured
in the nntp-server field).

**) Is there really a way to post to the other server(s) from PINE? I
haven't found it yet.  When I attempt it with what (I believe) to be
the configuration you're suggesting, using an older version of PINE,
I get a strange error message

    error posting message: 421 SMTP server went away!

With recent versions of PINE it won't let me even try to post - it says
"validating newsgroups" (evidently validating them with my default
nntp-server) and then reports "Unknown news group"  and won't let me
move the cursor out of the newsgrps field. 

I am, however, able to post to this group if I reconfigure the second
server to be my default nntp-server.  But then I can't post to groups on
the first server. 

> o If you have the original value in this fiels *{nntpremote.foo.com/nntp}

Yes, that's understood.  Thanks.  For reading it's a distinct
improvement, but, as I say, posting still seems to be a problem.

You know, some people DO use Pine at home.  There's no point in being
rude.

To answer the lady's question:
Look in the headers in the composer.  You'll see one that says "Attchmnt".
Fill in the full path and filename of the file you want to send.  If you
filled it in correctly, then when you arrow up or down out of that field,
it will fill in with the approximate size of the file.  It will be
automatically MIME-encoded and sent with the note as a file attachment.

If you're using PC-PINE, I think you use standard dos filenames
(c:\whatever\whatever).  If you're using Unix or Linux Pine, you'll need
to use the mountpoint of your dos partition (/dosc/for/example).

hope this helps,

That's a satisfactory solution to another problem:
I wanted to mark the outgoing mail with different 
character-set header lines. You have helped me to
solve the problem: I can open two or three pine 
instances in two or three xterm windows

pine -p .pinercISO-8859-1
pine -o -p .pinercKOI8-R
pine -o -p .pinercISO-8859-8

I can easily read in either window, since it is easy
to change fonts in xterm window by <Ctrl-Right-Button>,
But I send letters in different languages from the
different windows.

Message-ID: <5ds6br$17fu@sat.ipp-garching.mpg.de>

As the subject says: I am using pine but I get loads of email sent
from SUN's mailtool with their non-MIME attachment style.

According to the Pine FAQ, there is a Perl script to convert
SUN's attachments to MIME compliant messages. I got the script
but how on earth can I teach pine to use this script to decode
the mailtool messages and show them as MIME attachments in the
mail box list?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

The description [*] says:  "This is a simple filter ..."
So you have to apply it to your mail filter - not Pine.

Hi,

One can use something like:
	 *{service.symantec.com/nntp}[symantec.*] 
to restrict to given group(s) the request to a nntp server.

Is ist possible to exclude the request of given group(s) for an nntp
server: On my main news server the groups symantec do not exist, and I
would like that their names does not appear in the folder collection
corresponding to this news server.

Regards,

Jean

You must enable suspend in the setup, then you can use Ctrl-Z as normal

Why would you want to send that much extra junk in all your messages? Just

It's actually not Pine that is slowing things down... it's typically the
smtp server that is doing address validation "while you wait".  This all
depends on the configuration of the smtp server.  Some defer checking, and
the associated DNS lookups, some don't.  In a worst case scenario, the
smtp server will actually try to automount the home directories of local
recipients to look for .forward file entries... that can take *forever*.

(That Pine talks directly to smtp servers, rather than queuing the msg, is
new in recent versions, motivated by the need to support ESMTP options
such as 8BITMIME and --later on-- Delivery Service Notifications.)

Thanks to everyone who sent me info on uploading a file!!!

It took two weeks, but I've finally figured it out!!!


Now, I have another question!

I tried to change the column wrap-around width to 132 characters, but the
default max value is 80.

Is there any way to change that?


Oh, and one more thing...

For some reason, when I upload a text file from my word-processing program to
Pine, it's placing a blank line between each line of text.

Can this be stopped?



I really appreciate all of your help!!!

Happy St. Valentine's Day to all!!!
Keep smiling!!!

Check to see if your server has the comp.mail.imap newsgroup.  It is
pretty new, so I don't know how widely it is being propagated...

I would recommend upgrading to the latest IMAP4rev1 server (v10.164). 
Some of the newer IMAP clients don't work (at least not well) with
older servers...

You may be on the right track here.  See below...

This is a BAD idea!  You should never NFS mount /var/spool/mail.

Locking doesn't work over NFS, period.

Here are some possibilities:

	- Move non-IMAP processes off of your IMAP server.  We find
	that having "single function" boxes leads to much better 
	performance without unexplained slowdowns caused by some
	obscure resource contention problem.

	- Switch to a more memory-efficient mailbox format.  Using the
	default Unix (Berkeley) mailbox format, the server has to keep
	the entire mailbox image in memory.  Other formats, like
	Tenex, only keep an index in memory.  The downside is that
	this puts a heavier load on disk access, which some systems
	don't handle too well.  

If you still need to split onto multiple servers, we have found that
giving every user a CNAME to each user and using DNS to keep track of
which server a user's folders are on works well.  You may need to
upgrade your DNS server though ;-)

It appears that the easiest way to add new incoming folders is to
manually edit my ".pinerc" file.  Does anyone know of a quick-n-easy
way to add new incoming mail folders from within Pine without manually
manipulating my ".pinerc"?

From the passage "a .DOC file to ftp to Windows and then to view there", I
draw the conclusion that George is using windoze. I've no idea if there is
something like mailcap available, but if it is, you can set it up to launch
the viewer from the View Attachment-window -- that seems to be what George
is looking for, right?

   Cool remark. Congrats...

What Mr. Schinkel forgot to mention, though, is that you need to make a
slight adjustment to your S(etup) C(onfiguration) for that, namely:

  [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

Otherwise that command won't do anything.

If there is, it should be liquidated. You *don't* want that many lines
because e.g. the people on VT100 terminals.

Right. Check the procmail packages on an ftp server near you for e.g.

Sorry, just kidding... Joe is smaller and easier to use than VI (Ruhe hier,

takes care of your reply marks (">").

       "JOE also emulates several other editors.  JSTAR is a close immitation
       of WordStar with many "JOE" extensions. JPICO is a close immitation
       of the Pine mailing system's PICO editor, but with many extensions
       and improvements. JMACS is a GNU-EMACS immitation. RJOE is a
       restricted version of JOE, which allowes you to edit only the files
       specified on the command line."

I was wondering why it had to be pico of all editors that comes with pine.
At least someone might expand its justification mechanism, because the way
it is, it's rather hard to handle...

To reply to my own question, the "enable-incoming-folders" option must be
enabled first.  Once enabled, the folder list will be expanded to include
an "Incoming Message Folders" section.  With the cursor in that section,
press the A key to add a new folder then respond to the prompts.

Jennifer, here's some extra information in case you need to upload to a
unix-machine:

   upload-command 
   	This option affects the behavior of the Composer's "Read
        File" (^R in the message body) and "Attach File" (^J in the header)
        commands. It specifies a Unix program name, and any necessary
        command line arguments, that Pine can use to transfer files from
        your personal computer into messages that you are composing.
        upload-command-prefix This option is used in conjunction with the

   Upload-command option. 
	It defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via
        standard output) immediately prior to starting upload command. This
        is useful for integrated serial line file transfer agents that
        permit command passing (e.g., Kermit's APC method).
          

Check those in your S(etup) C(onfig). You'll need the necessary software for
that, too.


And Don, if you're out there... Get a life. From what I've read from you,
I'd gather the only thing you know about u*ix is how to spell the name (if
incorrectly). Come back when you've something meaningful to say or go to
alt.children.flamewar, will you?

Do we have some moderator here, by any chance? I think I've seen enough
of Don Krull's "behaviour".

Robin

Date: 12 Feb 1997 22:54:54 GMT
Message-ID: <5dthnu$b3s@kachina.som.siu.edu>

I am using pine 3.91 on Sun Solaris 2.4. When I received a message 
that has multiple receivers, pine would put my machine's name onto 
other receivers' address, so a user jsmith@abc.com whould have a address
like: jsmith@som.siu.edu. Can anyone advise on this?

Thank you,
Nancy

To add it to Pine headers, Use M,S,C to get to the Config/Update screen and
then add the above header in the 'Customized headers' variable.

I sent this message to bug-report, but maybe someone else can help me.
Sorry if the last part (the logon-logout sequence) is in french.

Subject: Connecting by modem

This is not a bug report, but I didn't knew where to ask for help. I'd
like to know if (and how) it's possible to use PC-Pine to retrieve and
send mail. I have an email accout at Montreal University that I logon to
using my computer at home (with a modem). I have a PC with Windows 95 and
I used HyperTerminal (included with Win95) to connect to my account. At
the end of this message, I copied the logon-logout sequence. Any would be
appreciated.

P.S.: Presently, I'm using Pine 3.95 for Unix, but I don't really have an
=09Unix account (text interface). There is a menu (under "*** Service
=09Magellan ***") where I can open Pine or Pico and other programs.
P.P.S.: If you need additional informations or if I need to ask someone
=09else, please email me.

Thank You

=09=09Martin :)

this might be the same question, but i have an account i am weaning myself
from and a new account i am trying to get people to send me mail to.  as
such, i sometimes get personal mail at the old account that gets forwarded
to my new account but does not show up in my new account as personal.  is
there a way to make this happen?

(also email a copy of any replies, please)

Try taking a look at the "alt-addresses" variable in Pine's Setup
Configuration screen; it should let you do what you want.

What version of Pine is this option in.  I am using 3.91 PMDF Pine, and 
haven't been able to get this to work.

Since my mail is all sent to me via my iNAME mail forwarding address, 
each time I reply to a message, I am asked if I want to reply to all 
recipients - which is my matt@null.net address in the To: field.

Would having the alt-addresses feature remove this?

Yes, setting "alt-addresses" can prevent unwanted "reply to all" prompts.
This is because Pine ignores your own e-mail address when constructing a
reply list; if there's more than one resulting recipient it asks you if
you want to reply to all people (or just the message's author).

By teaching Pine that other e-mail addresses are "you" it will ignore
these too when constructing the reply list.

For example I have mail forwarded to me from our "news", "ftp" and
"webmaster" e-mail addresses.  Thus in addition to (the default deduced by
Pine) pmb1@york.ac.uk I set alt-adddresses to:

	news@york.ac.uk
	ftp@york.ac.uk
	webmaster@york.ac.uk

Any messages arriving in my INBOX as being "To:" any of these get marked
with the "+" "direct-to-you" marker in the Folder Index, and have those
addresses ignored if I hit Reply.

Cheers,

Thanx for pointing that out, it would appear that way. What threw me was the

Hi there,

I have recently installed Linux on my PC and would now like to use my old
PC-Pine mailfolders under real Pine. Is there any way to convert them to a
format readable to real Pine ???  If you don't mind, please send your
answers also to my email address since I'm not a subscriber.

Thanks in advance,             Gerald

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi !

When trying to open pine for reading my mail and I type "pine" at the
prompt of the server, it appears a sentence:

Who are you ? (unable to look up login name )

I've been using pine for a very long time without any kind of problem.
Just a few days ago, this always appear whenever I type pine in the
prompt of the server and I do not know what does it means and how to
solve it. Apparently I am the only one using pine right here and the
system manager has no idea of it. Can anyone please help me to solve
this problem allowing me to see my mail in a Unix-Linux platform ?

Thanks in advance.

Miguel Sanjuan

This sounds like a badly configured sendmail.cf file, if that's the transport
the Sun is using. If not, whatever config file is driving your mail delivery
system is stripping off the original domain and appending your local one, as
if it's assuming everyone on the system receives local mail only. Contact
your system admin and alert him/her to this.

Regards,
Joe

Well, this was indeed a banner day.  I agree with
Robin wholeheartedly, and I'll bet neither Robin nor I
thought that was going to happen anytime soon :-)

It takes awhile to get to 'know' personalities behind
e-mail postings, Tracey, and the thing on this list is,
we all know Ed pretty well - certainly well enough to
know there's no way he'd post the stuff you thought
came from him.  Heck, I didn't even see the original
message, yet I knew reading your post that the stuff
you were quoting couldn't have come from Ed.  It's
never a bad idea to post flames directly to the flamee,
and in this case, you would have been better off doing
that...

Anyhow, later...

Lea

Can I use PINE running on my UNIX system to connect to an internet 
service provider vis modem and send/receive internet email?  My service 
provider tells me that I require MIME compliance, which I see that PINE 
is.  I'm confused about where the various layers of a mail system start 
and stop.  Thanks for your help.

If you're using a standard LinuX distrib, you'll have mailcap. Check the
following passage for further detail. We've been discussing problems with
several types of attachments here before, e.g. text/html in Netscrap
messages, so you might want to check the archive or deja news, too.

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++
Here's something from the FAQ (*hint* *hint*):

 image-viewer (in your S(etup) C(onfig))
   This variable names the program to call for displaying parts of a MIME
   message that are of type IMAGE. If your system supports the mailcap
   system, you don't need to set this variable.
          
   If Pine sees a MIME message part tagged as type IMAGE, and Pine's
   image-viewer. configuration variable is set, Pine will attempt to send
   that attachment to the named image viewing program. In the case of UNIX
   Pine, the DISPLAY environment variable is checked to see if an X-terminal
   is being used (which can handle the images). If the image-viewer variable
   is not set, Pine uses the mailcap system to determine what to do with
   IMAGE types, just as it does for any other non-TEXT type, e.g. type
   APPLICATION. For MIME's generic "catch all" type,
   APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM, the mailcap file will probably not specify any
   action, but Pine users may always Save any MIME attachment to a file.
++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++

Be sure to check the man pages for all that (mime, mailcap etc.) and take a
look at the tech-notes for pine. These things _can_ be kinda complicated ;-)

Robin

Subject: Help for pine !!!

Hi !

When trying to open pine for reading my mail and I type "pine" at the
prompt of the server, it appears a sentence:

Who are you ? (unable to look up login name )

I've been using pine for a very long time without any kind of problem.
Just a few days ago, this always appear whenever I type pine in the
prompt of the server and I do not know what does it means and how to
solve it. Apparently I am the only one using pine right here and the
system manager has no idea of it. Can anyone please help me to solve
this problem allowing me to see my mail in a Unix-Linux platform ?

Thanks in advance.

Miguel Sanjuan

On my system, we run Pine over sendmail. The layers as I see them:

				Pine (user interface)
				---------------------
				Sendmail (transport)
				---------------------
				Unix (operating sys)

Sendmail handles the connection to the ISP. Sendmail's alias is smtp, which
is the command you'll want to search for to see what's running behind the
scenes. If you're on SCO Unix, try looking for "mmdf".

Good luck!

    Sigh.  Repetition number 4,238,109 of this Frequently Asked
Question.  What you are describing is Pine's default behavior.  The
design assumption is that you already know your own name, so why repeat
it to you?  Show something else instead.  However, you can change this
behavior away from the default.  Go into the configuration and read the
online help for index-format.

I don't have an ASCII table handy to check, but that looks like the pattern
I'd expect if the parity settings don't agree between the two ends of the
remote connection, especially if at least one end is set for 7 bit
characters instead of 8 bit characters.

When I send mail from my PC at home, it gets queued in the mailqueue until
I start a dialup, then my queue is emptied (sendmail -q).

With pine (3.95) sending mail via ^X takes up to about 5 minutes, until it
gives me the 'mail sent' message ...

With elm it works all well and all my mail is sent in seconds, but pine
seems to wait for something.

If anbody can help me fix this I will be really happy.

Subject: pico - right margin setting by environment parameter?

I learned that option -r# (# is a numeral) can set the right margin for
Pico.  I wonder if one can set an environment parameter for Pico.  I
use tcsh in Irix 5.3 if it matters.

Thanks for your attention!

What version of Pine is this option in?
(Do you know?)

My system uses PMDF Pine 3.91.

I am seeking tested modem - Terminal emulation packages that would support local
printing under Windows95 and MAC OS. (Will Hyperterminal get the job done?)
I once knew where there was a list of communication programs supporting
ANSI printing, but no longer can find it.

Thanks,

The problem stems from the different way Pine talks to Sendmail.  In
previous versions, Pine just handed the message off to sendmail and
let sendmail parse the message, etc.  Recent releases invoke sendmail
interactively to negotiate ESMTP options, addresses, etc.
Unfortunately, in interactive mode, Sendmail insists on doing a DNS
lookup for each address on the list.  Sendmail can be configured to
not do the DNS lookup, which is what we do here at UW.

The release notes also discuss other techniques for improving the
sending performance.

imap comes with pine (and is made, when perl is made)
You must install ist on Your machine, add an entry in /etc/services
imap            143/tcp
and an entry in /etc/inetd.conf
imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/imapd         imapd
                                        (the path of the program)

The characters which can be entered are:

(Just realised that the lower and upper-case chars complement each other
very nicely.)

: Maybe you need to set TERM (upcase)?  Is vt102 defined in the termcap?
: Do the docs to your terminal program say that it will understand it?

The terminal program is set to vt102. So are are "term" and "TERM".
The termcap entry for vt102 looks fine to me. The problem may have something
to do with Pine, since elm works without problems. However, I have downloaded
and compiled two different versions of Pine (in addition to the one installed
by the Sys Admin), but the problem occurs in each of them.
Any more ideas?

The "alt-addresses" configuration option is definitely present in Pine
3.95 (the current version).  I _think_ it was introduced in Pine 3.93, but
it would be silly to migrate to that if you're planning to upgrade: move
to the current version instead.

Cheers,

I have a long global address list.

When users reply to messages sent to this list they often will "reply to 
all recipients".  The list name may be one of the recipients in the CC 
field and all members of the list will recieve the reply.

In most cases, the responder should have answered "no" to the "reply to all 
recipients", but for whatever reason chose "yes".

How can I set up Pine to exclude list names from the CC line when using 
the reply command?

Thanks.  JjT

You have at least three choices:
a) xbin - available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, and SUMEX mirrors,
   as /info-mac/cmp/hqx-to-bin-tool.shar,
b) mcvert - also available from SUMEX as /info-mac/cmp/mcvert-216.shar,
   and
c) macutils - available from mac.archive.umich.edu as
   mac/util/unix/macutil2.0b1.shar

All three packages work under SunOS 4.1 and Linux 1.x, 2.x.  mcvert is 
probably the most useful of these three.  The mac archives at UMich have
additional unix utilities to handle Mac files.

Later,

I don't know if this is a pine problem, as I always us pine and cannot
compare, uh, but

	Whenever I see a post I have made to a newsgroup, it is always
listed as 
	To:<insert newsgroup name>
where other people seem to have managed to get their names in this place.
Now, It is not that I want to see my name in print so badly, but is does
seem incorrect.

	Any help is appreciated,

I am thinking of using procmail along with Pine 3.95 to automagically filter
my mail into various local folders on my Unix (Solaris 2.5) machine.

I just thought of something: 

Procmail will put various messages into various files (folders) according to
the rules I give in my .procmailrc. So far so good. 

But how the heck am I to know which folders to open and read? I dont want to
go and look in each and every folder and look for the 'N' flag to see if I
have got any new messages. My purpose in doing mail filtering is to make life
more efficient/stream-lined. This 'hunting down new messages in all the damn
folders' is the exact opposite it this.

How have you guys dealt with this problem?

Sven, Nancy?

Thanks a lot,

Unix?  What?   What version of Pine are you running?

Have you tried, at the main menu of Pine, hitting s for
Setup and s for signature?  Then type whatever you
want, ctrl-x to exit, y to confirm accepting changes,
and that should do it.

Let us know how you make out...

    Just to clear up any possible misconceptions, what you see and what
your recipient sees may not be the same thing.  Pine by default shows
you one thing concerning your outbound mail.  What your recipient's
mailer shows him/her may be different.  There is a whole smorgasbord of
message headers.  Which one or ones a given mailer shows under any
given set of circumstances depend on the mailer, how it is configured,
and what the particular circumstances are.  These days, even two Pine
users at each end of the message channel may see something different.

Hi Miguel,

I'm not a "true guru" nor "techie" but I'm going to try to explain this as
best I can.

First off, I thought this was someone playing a joke on you until this
happened to some of our users this morning too.  I had never heard of it
before your posting.

We run AIX Unix here so your solution may be slightly different.

What happened here was that the way our systems are connected together, was
not being recognized by one, "lost" system (this system was the victim of a
power failure last night). 
This system would not recognize certain users in the main passwd file, located
on our main system.

Our systems are linked together via something called "NIS" (formerly known as
yp or yellow pages).  Because the NIS link was not being fully recognized,
when users tried to get to their pine account, they got the "Who are you" 
message.
The "lost" system thought the users had been deleted.  I could tell this by
looking at their .pinerc file.  The ownership of the .pinerc file had been
given over to 3 numbers, as if their user accounts had been deleted.

Our solution was to "un-NIS" that one system, then "re-NIS" it so all were
recognized once again.

I hope that helps you a bit and if you already had a solution, great!
Perhaps you can let me know what your solution was too.

If anyone out there wants to correct any of my "not-quite" technical
explanation, please do (but be gentle!).  :-)

To hide the e-mail addresses of other recipients in a message you are
sending out...

*  If you have the e-mail addresses set up as a Distribution List within
   Pine's Address Book...

	1.  Give the C (Compose) command.
	2.  DON'T put anything in the "To:" header field, but leave your
	    cursor there (or on any other header line).
	3.  Type ^R (Rich Headers).
	4.  Type the Nickname of your distribution list into the "Lcc:"
	    field.
	5.  Carry on by filling out the Subject field, then write the
	    message text as usual.

*  If you aren't using a Distribution List...

	1-3.  As above
	4.    Type the e-mail addresses into the "Bcc:" field.
	5.    As above

There is built-in help for the "Bcc:" and "Lcc:" headers; put your cursor
on each in turn and type ^G (Get Help).

Cheers,

If you have arriving messages being delivered into different folders (eg,
by using the "procmail" or "filter" packages) you can set Pine up to make
checking and using these really easy...

1.  Start Pine and go to its Setup Configuration screen.

2.  Look for the "enable-incoming-folders" option.

3.  Read the builtin help for this (by typing "?"), then set it.

4.  Exit from the Setup Configuration screen, saving your changes.

5.  Go to the Folder List screen (L).

Your INBOX folder now appears in a "collection" by itself.  With the
cursor on any folder in this collection (currently you will only have the
INBOX there!) use the Add (A) command to give the name of another of the
incoming mail folders.  Repeat, adding each in turn.

You can now move between the mail folders using the Folder List screen, or
the Goto (G) command.

An even easier way is to use the Tab key.  This normally hunts through
your current folder for the next recent (or "important") message.  When
there aren't any more it will now offer to check further folders that you
have set up in the incoming folders collection.  If one of these contains
any recently arrived messages it will offer to open the folder so that you
can read them.

Cheers,

Date: Fri, 14 Feb 1997 17:24:18
Message-ID: <jukkav.12.0011682E@rhea.otol.fi>

Can someone help me with my problem ???

I'm using Pcpine in my microcomputer and mailhost is Sun-Soloaris server. 
Everything works fine except accessing .signature and .addressbook files in my 
home directory in Solaris. The files exist and their protection is:
  
-rwxr-xr-x   1 jukkav        609 Jan  2 13:08 .signature
-rwxr-xr-x   1 jukkav       1494 Feb 12 08:45 .addressbook

in pinerc-file are rows:

# Over-rides default path for signature file. Default is ~/.signature
signature-file=~/.signature

# List of file or path names for global/shared addressbook(s).
# Default: none
# Syntax: optnl-label path-name
global-address-book=~/.addressbook

# List of file or path names for personal addressbook(s).
# Default: ~/.addressbook (Unix) or \PINE\ADDRBOOK (PC)
# Syntax: optnl-label path-name
address-book=~/.addressbook


I can't get my signature file in mails and when I try to use my addressbook 
Pcpine says:

Personal AddressBook <~/.addressbook>                                              (Un-readable)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Global AddressBook <~/.addressbook>                                                (Un-readable)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     [ Permission Denied ]


If someone cound tell me teh answer to this problem, I would be wery glad !

I understand that accessing to these two files is bossible.

Please mail me: jukka.vahamaki@otol.fi

Hi this is Emmanuel from Mexico City, I am having some troubles trying to
talk to my friend in Norway, what can I do, I have been awaiting, and I
know he is sitting in front of his PC at this moment. 

How exactly does the talk command works? If I am using my e-mail, when or
where do I check if he is ringing/calling?

Hmm.. that sounds interesting. 

But it is still not what I am looking for. Say procmail siphons off my mail
into 3 of such incoming folders that I defined as above. Looking at Pine,
which is displaying my INBOX (primary incoming mail), I have *no* way to know
exactly how many messages are waiting for me in each of my other folders in my
incoming folder collections.

I like the way Pine changes my Xterm icon/title to tell me that '3 new
messages. Most recent from John Doe'. 

Is there a way I can get similar functionality (a summary report) of all my
new messages in all my incoming folders? Or am I asking too much from Pine?

From what you say, the only option I have is to merrily <Tab> along blindly!
What I am looking for is a cure screen that I can invoke on-demand that tells
me the number of new messages in each of my incoming folders! 

Also, Pine does not beep or do anything special when a message is filtered off
into a incoming folder other than INBOX. In a given day, say I am working with
Pine iconized, how am I going to tell that procmail just did a bit of work and
channelled a mail to folder XXX? 

*sigh* I think I know what your answer is going to be! 

Thanks for your reply, Mike. I appreciate it.

Emmanuel:

This is easy to do.  Assuming your UNIX system has the Talk daemon
enabled, just type "talk user@xyz.edu", where user@xyz.edu is the fully
qualified email address of your friend in Norway.  Your screen will clear,
and you'll get a split line, dividing the screen into two halves.  You
will use the top half to type your text, and their text will appear in the
bottom half.

While trying to connect, you'll see a message (usually) that states Talk
is waiting for an answer, or that your friend is not logged on.  Either
way, you'll understand when you see it.  To leave the talk daemon, just
use your normal escape sequence, like control-c or control-d.  

If your friend is using PINE, they need to have the "allow talk" option
set on in Setup / Configuration.  This way, if you try to ring them while
they are in PINE, their screen will show your incoming talk message.

If you want to see if they are signed on first, just substitute "finger"
for "talk" above.  

Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any more questions!

Here is an solution for this problem. It assumes that your procmail 
has set VERBOSE=no. What is does it display a small window in right bottom
corner of your screen there the latest emails scrools (you can use the
scoll bar to see what came before)

I have this in my .xinitrc

/usr/local/bin/maillog +ls -title "Mail Log" -geometry
80x10-0-0 -e tail -f /home/adam/mail/incoming/procmail.log &

--
and output looks something like this :

However, the feature which I really miss is the 'threaded folder' ie that
I can have all mail sorted by time it came by inbox, yet still have all
followups to given subject under the first email w/ this subject.

As I understand this should be in the Pine 4.0, thus my question, when I
should expect the pine 4.0 come out...

By the way does anyone know any threaded mailer? If such exist I would
like to give it a try...

Jukka,

Sounds to me like you should be using the PC-Pine addressbook and signature
files, as you are using PC-Pine to compose your mail. The Solaris server is
only your relay host. Choose the PC-Pine filenames from your Pine setup
screen (\PINE\ADDRBOOK instead of ~/.addressbook, etc.)

Good luck

I NEED YOUR HELP!!!

i have been struggling with pine problems for about 2 weeks. i have asked
my university computer people what's up and they can't answer me.

here's what's wrong:

i accidently opened my mailtool when pine was on.  i know this was stupid.
ever since, i cannot exit pine, i cannot delete messages from pine and
sometimes it just randomly locks up on me.

what is wrong and what can i do?  i really don't want to have to switch to
eudora.  i need telnet and pine!

any help or suggestions you can give would be greatly appreciated.

sincerely, 
chris mullarkey

p.s. sometimes it reads on the bottom of the screen:
"unexpected locking failure"

thanks.

If the RFC says "should" rather than "must", then it's not wrong
for the client agent to allow the user to choose.

Thanks for the reference, though.  I hadn't noticed that the RFC
1036 says this:

    If the keyword poster is present, follow-up messages are not
    permitted.  The message should be mailed to the submitter of the
    message via mail.

Which appears to forbid the client from posting.  That's good, in a
way, since I routinely refuse email replies[*], so it'll save me time
and effort.  However, I think it's somewhat counterproductive.

[*]unless I perceive that it's a matter that really does require
personal handling; or the poster has made a convincing argument, e.g
offering a plausible promise to post a summary.

Hi, I am having trouble with using pine from my internet provider 
(aracnet). I can't send anymore messages and I can't open my inbox. It 
says things like: "quota exceeded", "inbox is not in valid mailbox 
format". Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. Dara Partovi.

This is why I claim this information should be in the tech-notes, and the
FAQ.

I had the same problem.  The answer can be found in the context-sensitive
help in Pine.  In Setup/Config/news-collections, type '?' and you will
find out that to access the local spool, you need to type '*[]' on the
news-collections line.

Also in Setup/Config, way down toward the bottom of all the stuff you can
configure, make sure that news-spool-dir points at your news spool (mine,
for example, says '/var/spool/news').  I believe the default is
/usr/spool/news.  Also make sure to fill in the path for your news active
file.

I use pnews and suck to build my news spool, and it works just fine with
Pine - now that I know how to tell it where the news spool is!

My ISP recently made some changes to their mail set-up. Subsequently,
whenever I send a message the intended recipient will see, in the to:

What's up with this "undisclosed recipients" business? I didn't bcc:
anyone.

Is my mail being forwarded to a third party?

just a simple-probably stupid-question.  is it possible to open a personal
account with pine using my home pc?  up to now, i've had an account
through college.  i'm done with college now and they're closing my
account.  as i'm now familiar with pine, i wouldn't mind staying with it.

if not, are there any simple alternatives?  i'm not really interested in
anything like aol - just something to let me email, use newsgroups, etc.

thanks,

jim    email jg9343@acs.brockport.edu

	I am useing pine to read news.  But when I goto the news groups it
lists all of them now if I unsubscribe to a group it does not show up the
next time I goto news groups.  So my questions would be:
1. How would you delete them all?
2. After I subscribe to the ones I want to read, and later on would like
to see the all how would I go about bring all of them up?

Which is another word for: You don't have any space left on your hard drive.
Delete some old messages or other files that you don't need. This can be
done with the rm command. So check the man pages for quota and rm (man
quota, man rm) and do what they tell you.
  
  >"inbox is not in valid mailbox format". Any help would be appreciated.

Just what it says. Make sure you have a directory Mail (or whatever is in
your .pinerc, and that you have a file (*not* a directory) in it:
# Path of (local or remote) INBOX, e.g. ={mail.somewhere.edu}inbox
# Normal Unix default is the local INBOX (usually /usr/spool/mail/$USER).

Enjoy,

He does not state he is using Un*x.  He could be using APine, the Amiga 
port of Pine, or some other port that allows spaces in filenames.

E(xport) the mail to your home dir, giving it a unique name. Then copy the
file onto the floppy. Something like
	cp <filename> /dev/fd0 
should work, provided your floppy is mounted. Otherwise, check if you have
the mtools installed (e.g. which mcopy).

Cheers,
Robin

Probably the easiest way to acomplish this is to go to Setup> configure and
down to Custom headers (I think that's what it says) and add in 
"Reply-to: mgaebler@foo.com"...

Do one thing, go to the unix prompt and delete your .newsrc file
When U come back , the folder list would be empty and then you can
subscribe to each one with pressing A for subscribe. and for getting a
foldder list :
Press ^T

Jim:

This is possible, and there are no stupid questions!  :)  Many ISP
(Internet Service Providers) will offer users a variety of service levels
that range from basic shell access to full blown PPP access with all the
goodies.  Most ISP's (except the heavy commercial ones like AOL, MSN,
Ameritech, PacBell, Prodigy, etc.) offer shell access to a UNIX account,
which normally includes PINE and/or ELM.  Plus, most will offer POP3
and/or IMAP access also, so your mail possibilities are many. 

A good place to look for ISP's in your neighborhood is: 
http://www.thelist.com.  You can search by area code or region to find a
yellow-pages type listing of the services in your area.  Just call them up
beforehand and get your questions answered.  See if they have a type of
service that helps you out. 

Good luck!

Anyhow, it's *bad* style to do that :-) Just because it's allowed doesn't
mean it makes sense... If he ever wants to take those files to another
system, he'll end up with these horrible ~-filenames...

ymmv ;-)

This feature has been discussed, but it's not as easy as it sounds.  Put
another way, the function is obvious, the precise details of how it should
work (the elusive "right thing") are not.  Some of the problems are a bit
hard to explain, since there are interactions with capabilities that are
new in 4.00/IMAP4.  What seems to be obvious from looking at 3.95 is much
less obvious in 4.00.

Necessary preliminary work has been started; internally, multiple .newsrc
files will be supported, there's just no way for users to get at the
feature.  I can't promise that it'll be in 4.00; but it would almost
certainly be in 4.01.

	The speller on the new version of Pine, called ISPELLER, is
checkcing the misspelling on lines that contain ">"
	This does not make any sense.  The old Speller did not check the
linse that have ">" in them.
	Any ideas?

Hi all:

	Got a strange problem here we can't seem to work out. We are
sunning Pine 3.95 on a Solaris 2.5 box. Pine works great for most users,
however, for some it keeps giving an INBOX access error. I thought it
might be the volume of mail that these users were getting but it turns out
that I get much more mail then they do. I have checked all permissions and
they match with my working pine's folder permissions. I have tried
deleteing all of there folders and rc files. I have even copied my rc file
over to there's. Basicly they are set-up exactly as my working account is
(even checked mesg status) but they get this error and I NEVER do.
Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

How can I  <Send>  more than one file at a time from INBOX to some other
folder?

Have previously used PINE 3.93ca.  And could at least line 'em up, then
run down the list.  But now with 3.94,  <newfoldername>  has to be typed
in for each  <Send>  command.

Thanks in advance.			- Paul

Is it possible to create a group in pine to whom you want to send
regular e-mail messages?  I would like to be able to save several e-mail
addresses under one name and be able to write to them all just by
pulling that one name out of my addressbook.  Is this possible?  If it
is, what do I need to do?

Please reply to my e-mail address as I don't always get to check news.  

Thank you,

For some reason the signature I've been constructing (two lines only, low

Hi Paul,
Well if you want the signature at the bottom of every mail, just go to
setup, configure and look for the option: " signature-at-bottom" checkmark
that and That's done.

     PLEASE do not consider doing this.  The majority of people read their
e-mail on systems that have 80 column displays.  The line-wrapping that
happens to messages written with 132 characters per line does not look
very nice and gets very hard on the eyes.

     May I recomment that you stop using a word-processing program to edit
your e-mail responses and start useing a text editor [ie DOS Edit, Qedit,
Windows Notepad, etc...].  Word-processors are not the greatest programs
when it comes to editing simple text only files.

Hi Greg,
Well even if we use a DOS EDIT or any Simple TEXT or ASCII Editor, then
also when we upload the text file in the message using protocol as ASCII ,
then during that ASCII upload, it leaves one blank line between each line
though sometimes.THis has been a problem with me also.Any reasons?

Sonu.

Jeez.. you are following up to a Usenet posting, your subject line has a 'Re:'
and still the post does not have a  'References' line to tell me what article
you are following up to. I asked my newsreader to get me the parent article to
this article and it said 'Article has no parent reference' ! Talk about
breaking the thread for other newsreaders !

No offence.. I dont mean this to you personally..but this is just one more
instance where I find that Pine as a Usenet newsreader just sucks beyond
belief.

Well, procmail's logfile will have the info on the filtered email.
You can use a script to gather this info and give you a summary.
However, you have to decide when to clear the log - every time you get
the summary or periodically or just do it manually when you see fit.

No solution is perfect.  Just try and see.  Or look at it the same
way as with Usenet and newsgroups - start your mailer and see.

I use this command to get a screenfull from the end of procmail's log:

	grep "^  Folder:" ~/.procmail/log | tail -${1:-$LINES}

There are probably better ways - let us hear about them!

Actually there is.  If you are in the INBOX all you have to do is hit the
down arrow.  If that doesn't work, you can try Control-L.  The down arrow
is faster because Control-L forces a screen rewrite.  There is also a
mail-check-interval that you might want to look at in the newer versions
of Pine.

Is it possible to map keys in pine?
I hate to use curser keys to move around and cntr-c to quit 
out of something. cntr-c really gets me. Why on earth 
I should hit 2 keys to quit. 

I love vi-bindings and like to use j-k and esc instead..

I created some folders by mistake in the Incoming Message Folders grouping
(the one with the INBOX) and now I can't seem to delete them.  What do I
do?  Also When I post to a newsgroup instead of saying my name or
something in the index when you look at all the messages mine says
"To:comp.mail.pine".  What's up with that?

any help would be appreciated

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE


This message is being sent to pine-info@cac.washington.edu weekly to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Well, if they close down your account then you won't get any email, will you?
So why bother with installing Pine on your PC?  Read old email, perhaps?  ;-)

That's S(ave), isn't it? Anyhow, enable the following in your pinerc and
read the help that comes with the entry:

        enable-aggregate-command-set,
	The availability of the aggregate operations commands is determined
	by the "enable-aggregate-command-set" feature-list option in your

Here's something from the tech-notes to toy around with, too, if you have

	The save-aggregates-copy-sequence feature is suppressed from the

	many IMAP servers (including the UW IMAP server) do not preserve the

Well, you can always hit the Big Red to quit...

Luvly... Try using vi as an editor in pine, then:

	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly,
	enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
                
	# Specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer,

Very wild guess, but where do you upload those files to? If you upload them
to a u*ix-system, it could be a "dos2unix"-problem... Try this for a change:
	recode ibmpc:lat1 <filename>
If it works, you could put it in a simple shell script...

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++
The only difference between a distribution list and a simple entry with a
single address, is that a distribution list has more than one address
listed in the Addresses: field, whereas a simple personal entry has just
one address.

For individual address book entries, if there is a full name in the
Fullname: field (filling in the Fullname: field is not required), it is
used.  If the full name is specified in the Address: field and not in the
Fullname: field, then the full name from the Address: field is used.

If you type the nickname of a distribution list from one of your address
books in the Lcc: field, then the full name of that list is used in the
To: field.  If you put a list in the To: or Cc: fields, that list will be
expanded into all of its addresses.  If the list has a full name, then
that will appear at the beginning of the addresses.

Sewing Club <john@somewhere>, nancy@something.else, Sal <sal@here.there>

If the first address in the distribution list also has a full name, then
the list full name and that full name are combined into something like the
following:

Sewing Club -- John Smith <john@somewhere>

If you specify a list via Lcc, the full name is used in the To: line.  If
you specify a list in the To: or Cc: fields, then it uses the same method
as for individual entries for filling in the full name.

For help with editing and navigation commands, check the Help for the
Nickname: field.

This is due to the way that different operating systems, and sometimes 
even different applications, store EOLs (End of Lines).  There are two 
characters that can be used in ASCII - LF (Line Feed) and CR (Carriage 
Return).  Some systems use one, some use both.

Well, that's the reason.  To fix it you could find some sort of 
translation program, or find an editor that can save as a 
Un*x/Mac/DOS/Amiga etc. text file.

I don't know which system uses which method of storing EOLs.

Hi Robin,
Well as I already mentioned, I ASCII Upload them into the message itself
i.e I insert them INLINE into the message and that's when they leave a
blank line.

    I was wondering if anyone can give me a general idea of what can be
sent via e-mail.  
   
    If I understand correctly uuencoding is annoying past 500 bytes.

    How does FTP relate to pine ? (not that I even know what FTP is yet)

    Is there some way for me to upload a file to my current directory from
my PC or is that only possible on the machine running pine ?

    Is there such a thing as FTP e-mail (I had better stop here before
I look "really stupid")

    General or specific responses to any or all of these topics would be
very much appreciated.  Post 'em or e-mail me please.

While telnetting to your demo program at demo.cac.washington.edu, I found
two fascinating bugs.

First, in the Composer, if you delete the "sent-mail" from the Fcc: line,
so as to suppress file-carboning, the composer has an unnerving tendency to
restore when you don't want it to!

Second, when I tried to issue a bug report on this, I found that the demo
does not support this feature. Duh! But then I tried to exit... and found
that I couldn't! Control-C is listed as the exit key, but when I entered it
I got "Command ^C not defined for this screen."!!!

And in my mind's ear, Rod Serling begins speaking... and background music
begins to play...

Doo-dee-doo-doo, doo-dee-doo-doo, doo-dee-doo-doo, doo-dee-doo-doo...

Had to do a CTRL-] to exit!!!

Have FUN, boys... I'm sure you'll have a BALL...   :/

That's nothing to do with that... Anything above 64k is undesirable (size of
Intel's segments). Anything bigger than 1MB will not be accepted anywhere,
especially not at AOL (does anyone care?).

Not at all. FTP is a Protocol to Transport Files. It's usually done via so
called FTP-servers for which you need an extra account.

Upload where? To an ftp-server? Yes, if you have an ftp-account or the
permission to anonymously upload to an ftp-server. Other people can download
from there. If you mean: can I send emails containing binary files, the
answer is again yes. Just attach a file to your email. It's a _very_ good
idea to compress it first, using e.g. PKzip, ARJ, Compress, Gzip...
It's a *very* bad idea to post larger attachments to mailing lists and
newsgroups, though.

[standard disclaimer: there are not stupid questions, just AOL-users...]

ftp-email is a service provided by some servers. You send them an email
requesting a file and get many nice emails in return.

Cheers,
Robin

Not at all. Period. There are ways to do that, but that kind of stuff is
unnecessary, annoying and potentially fatal for many users on
text-terminals.

Any further questions?

Hi there.

I've been nagging the author of pgp-pine (Roland Rosenfeld
<roland@spinnaker.rhein.de> (wonderful piece of soft, check it out at:
	http://www.rhein.de/~roland/pgppine) 
about the slow performance of the scripts.

He again remarked that giving the user an opportunity to decide whether he
wants to run pgp over a received message or not would be a nice function to
have in pine. It can be quite annoying to wait for 5 secs for some message
to decode when you know that it isn't for you personally. So, I'd like to
second this proposal. Strongly... Any chance to see this implemented in a
future version of pine?

Aldo Valente <aldo@dagobar.rhein.de> has enhanced pgppine so that it
"remembers" your pass phrase and lets you send messages in the display
filter. He's still looking for beta-testers. The file can be found at:
	http://www.rhein.de/~aldo/pine.html

Cheers,
Robin

  I don't think this is possible, no matter how the e-mail program is
configured. In any case, the recipient can just save the message body into
a file and then forward it off as a "new" message.

  Hope this helps. :)

Robin,
Having a command that allows you to invoke filters after you are already
viewing the message seems superfluous...

How would such a command differ from the existing pipe command?
(e.g. "|p" --if the script was given the name "p")

Subject: Pine: problem with Inbox...HELP PLEASE!!!
Message-ID: <856145721.6157@dejanews.com>

Please help:

When I log into my system to check my mail with pine my Inbox goes crazy.
 First off, a message comes up saying that it's checking the inbox for
new messages which it does every time, but now it's taking an unusally
long time(minutes rather than seconds).  Then a message says that inbox
was open with mail lock process 8001 and that the folder is read-only. 
So I can't delete any messages from the inbox.	All of my other folders
seem to be working fine, I can move files to and from them.  I can save
messages to other folders from the inbox, but they still won't delete and
I've got close to 200 messages and growing.  Also, every time I log in it
still counts all the messages in the inbox as new, even if I've read them
before. Does anybody out there know what's going on and can possibly help
me? I've called my sys admin but she didn't know what was going on and
said that she had never seen anything like this happen before.

If you can help me please mail me direct.

Thanks

I know this isn't the right newsgroup for this question, but humor me. 
;)  

I tried to set up a filter for my stepmom's e-mail (Linux - not sure of
the version number), but so far I haven't figured out how to get it to
work like mine.  I use 'filter' with a simple 'filter-rules' file, and the
.forward file.  It works great on mine, and I expected a minor problem or
two with hers (Murphy's Law), but I couldn't get it to work with incoming
mail that didn't fall into any of the filter rules; in other words, if it
didn't filter the mail, instead of putting it into the standard 'INBOX'
file, it would generate a filter-error saying something about 'couldn't
find lock file' and then put the message into a new file in her root
directory call 'EMERGENCY-MBOX'. 

Here's a copy of her .forward file:

     "|/usr/bin/filter -vo /home/csmith/.elm/filter-errors"

I tried it first with just the -o, later adding the v to make it -vo.
Neither made any difference.

Anyone out there ever had this trouble when setting up a filtering system 
for yourself?  I had *no* problem with mine, and following Nancy 
McGough's FAQ under the '4.0 Filter' section gave me no clues for 
troubleshooting this particular problem.  Or, can someone direct me to 
the appropriate FAQ or newsgroup for getting to the bottom of this 
dilemna.  

I'd rather keep it simple by using 'filter' rather than trying to install 
and set up something like procmail, which I have yet to sit down and try 
to do on my system, so I don't want to experiment too much on hers. 

Thanks in advance.

Subject: DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE -- FOLDER INTERNAL DATA
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I've got pine set to auto-move-read-msgs into a folder called 
saved-mail.

When I access my pine mailbox from Netscape via IMAP, or use a mail 
checking program that checks the number of messages in my mailbox via 
POP3, it creates a message at the beginning of the mail file that is 
from "From: Mail System Internal Data"  and has a subject of: "Subject: 
DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE -- FOLDER INTERNAL DATA".  

This message is marked as read, or not marked as unread.  I'm not sure 
how that mechanism works.  Anyway, Pine moves it to my saved-mail 
folder, if I don't delete it.  

Is there any way to make pine ignore that particular message?  Or is 
there a way to make the IMAP/POP3 server create the message with the 
Unread bit set?

Wim.

Nestled among the "Setup" items (from the Main Menu) is the "Newpassword"
command. Invoking it gives you the most ATROCIOUS screen I have ever seen
in Unix Pine: a BLANK SCREEN with NOTHING ON IT AT ALL except the cryptic
notation, "Changing password for <username> on <sitename>" plus a request
for your "Old password"!

In a program such as Pine, with its constant offerings of options and
context-sensitive help, this is, to say the very least, disconcerting.
It gives the user the uneasy feeling that he has just been abaondoned.
In fact, the user HAS just been abandoned!

There is...        o  NO context-sensitive help;
                   o  In fact, NO help at ALL;
                   o  NO information as to what this command does --
                         at least, none readily findeable in the
                         course of casual experimentation!
                   o  NO way to abort it in the usual manner --
                         a CONTROL-C is not honored;
                   o  NO indication on how to abort it (a blank
                         carriage return on the first prompt will
                         do this, but we Mere Lowly Users are never
                         told this); and
                   o  Absolutely NO warning WHATEVER that what you
                         are about to do is to change your LOGIN
                         password, and NOT merely to add some sort
                         of password protection to Pine itself.

I would be very hard put to conceive of a more User-UNfriendly situation; this
is not only frustrating and perverse, it can be DANGEROUS! I can't *begin* to
imagine what the hell you guys were smoking the day you came up with this one!

To me, this is damned inexcusable. It is a TOTAL DISGRACE to a program that
is RENOWNED the WORLD OVER for being *completely* User-Friendly.

Not only is this a letdown to your users, it would appear to be a lapse in
YOUR OWN DESIGN GOALS! Remember these...?:

"...Our goal was to provide a mailer that naive users could use *without
    fear of making mistakes.* [Emphasis added.] We wanted to cater to users
    who were less interested in learning the mechanics of using electronic
    mail than in doing their jobs; users who perhaps had some computer
    anxiety. We felt the way to do this was to have a system that *didn't
    do surprising things and provided immediate feedback on each
    operation..."* [Emphasis added.]
                                                     --Pine Project History.

                            --= AND =--

      "...- *Pine must be very tolerant of user errors.* [Emphasis added.]
          Any time a user is about to perform an irreversible act (send a
          message, expunge messages from a folder), Pine should ask for
          confirmation.

         "- *Users should be able to learn by exploration without fear of
          doing anything wrong.* [Emphasis added.] This is an important
          feature so the user can get started quickly without reading any
          manuals and so fewer manuals are required..."
                                                --Pine Technical Notes,
                                                  Version 3.95, July 1996.

Frankly, it just doesn't seem that the "Newpassword" command complies with
these lofty standards at all!

SUGGESTIONS:
===========
Personally, I would prefer that the "Newpassword" command be REMOVED. It
doesn't belong in Pine anyway, since it's really a Unix management command
and not Pine-related at all. But if you INSIST on keeping it, here are a
couple of ways in which it might be made more user-friendly:

FIRST, there should AT THE VERY LEAST be "^G Get Help" and "^C Cancel"
functions. "Get Help" should print text somewhat similar to what I suggest
below; whereas Control-C should abort immediately to the Main Menu, without
-- and I will repeat that, WITHOUT -- implementing ANY change in password.

Even better still would be a short explanatory message displayed at the
top of the screen. You might have something like the following:


         "This function is offered as a convenience to those users
          who use Pine as their start-up screen. It is not really
          a function of Pine; rather, it offers a convenient way
          of changing the system password used at LOGIN, when you
          start a new Unix session."


Such a message could be improved even further by adding (of course you'd
have to implement it first):


         "You can quit this function at any time by typing Control-C."


In my opinion these SHOULD have been put in place when the command was
first impleneted... but hey, better late than never, right?     :/

Hi,


Check whether they are not accessing their mails using some other
programs like Eudora or Netscape. This Happens when the new mails of 
account being accessed by multiple programms/users.Also Check whether
the /var/mail is NFS mounted and may be due to network problem the
net traffic gets Jammed. This error also comes if you are unable to
access the Mails due to network problems.

Hope this helps

Regards

Samir

Just add 'Cc: someone@somewhere.com' as a Customized-header in your Config
screen (Main/Setup/Config). And since 'Cc: is already in the
Default-composer-header variable (by default), any new mail you start to
compose will have the 'Cc: someone@somewhere.com' value already pre-inserted!
Voila!

I just tried it out and it works just as I have described.

    When you are preparing a message to send out over the Internet --
which is why I presume you are uploading it so that Pine can do
something with it -- I strongly urge that you do not use a word
processing program at all: use a text editor.  Unless users are
knowledgeable and sophisticated in using their programs correctly, my
observation has been that word processors cause a lot of grief, because
what people see on their screens is often *NOT* what winds up going out
to the world.

    Word processors tend to do a lot of internal jiggery-pokery with
files which is not transferable to the larger world out there.  One
simply cannot assume that what they see is what their recipients will
see -- frequently the recipients see a lot of garbage-looking
characters, overlength lines, blank lines, and so on.  Preparing files
with a word processor for transmission is a tricky business.

    Word processors definitely have a place in this world, but I am not
convinced that preparing files for transmission via Pine is that place.

  Related, but different problem comes to mind. Pine queries INBOX and
other (remote) mailboxes as to whether there's any new messages at given
periodic interval( specifed somewhere in Configuration menu), so that I
can't see new messages unitl next time Pine checks INBOX even if they're
already saved in INBOX.  Is there any way to enforce Pine to renew   the
current "image" of INBOX ? If not, adding the feature would be

Sometimes it's useful to put the reply at the top -- kind of like
appending a copy of the message to which you are replying.  I agree
that it shouldn't be the default, though.

If I remember right, if you press Next key when on the last message in
folder, Pine will check for new messages in this folder.

I rarely use this feature, as I don't get new mail every 15 seconds ;-)

An easier way of managing multiple incoming folders is to list them as
"incoming folders" ;-)

You can do this by setting the "enable-incoming-folders" option in Pine's
configuration screen.  You should also read its help entry whilst there to
see what it does.

After setting up your incoming folders you can just use the Tab key to
move between them.  Within a folder this searches for the next
"interesting" (unseen) message.  When there aren't any more in the current
folder Pine offers to check through your other incoming folders looking
for one with some recently arrived messages.

(Note: "recently arrived" isn't the same as "unseen".)

The closest you can get (as you probably know?) is "Ordered Subject",
which sorts first by Subject text and then by Date.

It only does this for your INBOX folder (plus the currently open folder if
not the INBOX).  In particular it does not monitor the other
"incoming-folders" folders to watch for new mail arriving into them.

I suspect this is partly for efficiency's sake: every additional folder
that has to be monitored is yet another IMAP connection to the mail server
machine.

You're asking too much, I'm afraid.

Well, not quite blindly... I think it skips over any subsequent
incoming-folders which don't have any recent messages in them.

You can't (see above).  I guess you'll have to start looking at running
some sort of "newmail" script in the background if you want this.

Hmm.. that sounds interesting. 

But it is still not what I am looking for. Say procmail siphons off my mail
into 3 of such incoming folders that I defined as above. Looking at Pine,
which is displaying my INBOX (primary incoming mail), I have *no* way to know
exactly how many messages are waiting for me in each of my other folders in my
incoming folder collections.

I like the way Pine changes my Xterm icon/title to tell me that '3 new
messages. Most recent from John Doe'. 

Is there a way I can get similar functionality (a summary report) of all my
new messages in all my incoming folders? Or am I asking too much from Pine?

From what you say, the only option I have is to merrily <Tab> along blindly!
What I am looking for is a cure screen that I can invoke on-demand that tells
me the number of new messages in each of my incoming folders! 

Also, Pine does not beep or do anything special when a message is filtered off
into a incoming folder other than INBOX. In a given day, say I am working with
Pine iconized, how am I going to tell that procmail just did a bit of work and
channelled a mail to folder XXX? 

More importantly, this method forces me to read mail in a extremely *linear*
fashion and to an extent, blindly! I cant see that Oh! Folder XXX has 10
messages, let me go there first. I *have* to <Tab> through junk until I get to
Folder XXX. Of course, I can always Goto Folder XXX but then that defeats the
purpose, right? I want a summary screen of how many new messages are there in
each of my incoming folders!

Oh well.. I guess I am asking for too much...

What 'frm' command are you referring to?

So? If you're on a u*ix system, the first thing you need to do is to set up
your own password. What's the point, then?

Yes, I've been pondering a very similar problem lately. I've found a
solution, though:
It's called "kill file" and contains things like: @GTI.Net

Man, you really got us all there.

Hmmmm.... What a strongly worded suggestion!  ;-}

Pine's "Setup NewPassword" command invokes whatever command your System
Administrator has set it up to use.  Pine can't offer context-sensitive
help about something it knows nothing about; the best it can do is to show
you the command's prompts, which it does.

The output you describe is actually the standard UNIX command to change
your password, usually invoked as "passwd" or "yppasswd", if memory
serves.

You could try suggesting to your System Administrator to "wrap up" the
change password functionality inside a friendlier script and have Pine
invoke that.

If seeing the NewPassword option present in Setup really offends you so
much, you can suppress it by setting the:

	disable-password-cmd

configuration option in either your personal or the systemwide Pine
configuration file.  (Note that this option is really intended for the
System Administrator to use in the systemwide file, rather than users in
their personal files.  Ergo there is no easy user interface to set this
variable in Pine's Setup Configuration screen; you will need to edit the
.pinerc file with a text editor.)

By the way, if you want to send a suggestion to the Pine Team the easiest
and best way is to use Pine's "B" (Bug) command at its Main Menu screen.
Look for the "Suggestions" option in the menu screen that follows; this
will start composing a message to the proper suggestions e-mail address:

	Pine Developers <pine-suggestions@cac.washington.edu>

rather than Pine-Info, which is a general discussion forum.

Cheers,

when you are in the index of that folder just hit x and it will ask you if
you want to expunge those messages just hit y!  if you are in a newsgroup
just hit tab and it will go to the next news group and take those messages
away!  Marcus

What is suggested for getting Filter or Listproc (for sorting-to-
INBOX?)

How does one get rid of a second (INBOX B) in one's Incoming Folder
"host", when it wants to keep coming back?

Sounds to me like you've got another process (or session of Pine) which is
locking the INBOX. That would cause both symptoms you're describing. Make
sure you're not running Pine on another terminal and if you still get the
same message, you must've disconnected ungracefully and left a lock file
behind somewhere. Have your SA look in /var/mail and /var/spool/locks for
stray lockfiles with your name on them.

Is it an Incoming Folder?

If so, I had the same problem on PMDF Pine.  I solved it by exiting Pine, 
and starting up $ MAIL, and deleting it from there.
Pine won't let you delete a folder it can't open. - which is bad news if 
you type the wrong stuff into the incoming folder creation sequence...:-)

You can also get that if it's a subdirectory; Pine displays it like a 
folder, but it can't open a subdirectory.

Hello,

I downloaded the zip'd up pcp_w32 file and its working fine.  The only
problem I have is the .hlp file included with the archive isn't usable.
When I try to use help within Pine, the client locks up, if I try to run
the .hlp file from File Manager, I get a message stating that the help
file isn't a windows help file or the file is corrupt.  Has anyone seen
this before?  I've recently subscribed to this list so I apologize in
advance if this issue has been discussed before on this list.

Thanks,
Steve Carey

PC-Pine's help file is intended to be used by pine (not the MS file mgr) 
in conjunction with the pine.ndx file, which contains the help file index
information. Make sure pine.exe, pine.hlp, and pine.ndx are all present in
the same folder.

All of the files are in the c:\pine directory from which pine is run.
I'm running NT 4.0 and I tested with a 3.51 machine, same results, the
pine client locks up.  I let it sit for 5 minutes then had to kill the
process.  Any other ideas?  

TIA
Steve

How about we start with the basics: Is this a networked printer, or directly
attached to your system?

How I could use the multiple folders w/out setting it ??

Anways, yeah I know about it, but it does not change fact that it is
hardly useful when you have 15 or so incoming folders and each have few
thousands emails, and 500 or new emails is coming per day.

Yes, I know about it, but still it is little readable/helpful when there
is few thousands email in a folder.

Here's a good one...anybody ever see that message before? It pops up
intermittently for no apparent reason, even when my terminal is sitting
idle.  What's interesting is that when I look at the mailboxes for Pine
users on my system, the modification time seems to *never* change. It
usually reads "Wed 31 Dec 1969" or something silly like that.

Any clues?

Vikas,

To recap for others (and make sure I'm on track): you want some way to
tell how many (if any) new messages await you in each of your incoming
folders, so that you may make your own choices of which messages to view.
"Tabbing blindly"  (nicely put, by whomever) is too linear and brute-force
a method to satisfy you. And I agree. 

My attempt at a solution from some time ago was one that relied on the
unix command 'frm'. What frm does is display information about mail
folders. (It is the same as 'from', except that 'from' displays senders in
uucp format, while 'frm' uses the person's name.) So, I used mine to tell
me the status of my incoming folders if and only if they had new mail in
them. I included the appropriate commands and structures in my .login
file.

The trouble was, the frm command could not acurately discern the status of
folders other than Inbox until Pine had somehow "touched" them (for lack
of a more precise term). To be more precise, this is what would happen: I
would log into my account, I would get a message telling me that there
were a certain number of messages in my Inbox (the regular folder, for
non-filtered mail). And nothing else would appear. "Too bad," I would
think. "No other mail." But then I would go into Pine, read my Inbox
stuff, and then on a lark go to one of the other folders. And it would
have stuff in there! Now if I then went out to Unix and ran the same
command that was previously blind, it would now see. Go figure.

Now I realize that you are using an X-Window system over top of Unix. And
there I can't say any more. I have used X, but only a few times. Although
the experience I have related here might give you some ideas to try out. 

Regards,
Dan

I also have this problem.  The Linux user name that i use... differs from the ISP user name... and so i must telnet to the ISP's server... in order to send mail.

Does pine presently, or will it in the future, support the maildir message
format available from MTAs such as qmail?

I didn't see anything about it in the docs.

Thanks

Anyone out there using the feature : incoming-archive-folders ?
I have troubles getting it to work.

In my .pinerc I have defined an test folder as shown below

incoming-folders= "acme" ~/mail/incoming/acme-mail
.
enable-incoming-folders
.
incoming-archive-folders=~/mail/incoming/acme-mail ~/mail/archive/acme-mail

and the incoming-archive-folders as above. Yet when I move form one 
incoming folder to another it does not attempt to move the 
messages form the folder in incoming dir to the folder in 
archive dir.

Any ideas why? 

-Adam

Hi folks!

Opening newsgroups in pine3.95 takes 1-2 minutes but opening them
i tin takes only a couple of seconds. Can someone explain this
phenomena to me, and even better, tell me how to solve the
problem?!

what version of pine are you running?  in 3.95 it is done through the t

    Well, I am not Sven or Nancy, but I have a technique which may
serve your purpose of knowing how many messages are in each folder
managed by procmail.  From your message header, you seem to be using
Solaris, which is a Un*x variant.  If Perl is installed on your system
(and you have a WWW browser), browse my home page under the Pine and
mail filtering section.  I have a shell script and a Perl script which
it calls which display how many messages are in each incoming folder
(and something about those in the INBOX itself).  You will have to
adjust it according to how many folders you have and what their names
are, of course.  Any other needed adjustments are your own, also, but
they are free for the taking.

From pine's in-built help:

        FEATURE: quell-status-message-beeping
        
This feature affects Pine's behavior when it displays status message (e.g.,
Error complaints, New mail warnings, etc). Setting this feature will not
affect the display of such messages, but will cause those that emit a beep
to become silent.

That's M(ain), S(etup), C(onfig).

Cheers,
Robin

Very nice idea... maybe I'll try it one day. As for now, I prefer the
regular way. Type 
	C(ompose),
	^T To AddrBk, 
	L ListMode, 
	X [Set/Unset].

Enjoy.

Hi all,

	I have a UNIX account at school and an account from my ISP, I want to
be able to read all the mails in both of the accounts.  I know making a
"/.forward" file will redirect all the email to a specific account to
the one specified in the ".forward" file but all the mail could not be
seen on that account.  Is there a similar file that would send a Carbon
Copy (CC) to another account so that I can read the mails of the two
accounts at both accounts ?

Thanks

Eddie

dear fellow piners,
	
I was wondering if you know of a way to organize the 175 newsgroups that I
subscribe to into directories to make it easier to access them.

thanks in advance.

Please send email to me @asheesh.ahuja@colorado.edu

[This message has also been posted to Usenet]
Hello all,
 Thanks to everyone who responded to my earlier posting about mail filtering,
procmail, etc.

I just had another thought. I am using Tenex mailbox format for some of my
larger folders since I found that Pine 3.95 works significantly faster when
using Tenex format. 

So some folders are Tenex, others are regular UCB format. Of course, Pine
handles them seamlessly and thats one of the things I love about Pine!

That being the case, does Procmail automatically append to the mail folder in
the appropriate format after first checking the existing format or does it
blindly append in UCB format.

If so, wont it *destroy* a Tenex format folder, thus rendering it completely
unusable? 

This is a pretty darned important consideration before jumping into procmail
and I just wanted to make sure.

Thanks again,
--Vikas

You cannot use procmail to append to tenex folder. 

You have to do something like that 
(this part is from ~/.pinerc file )
-----------------
#Pine Mailing List
#* ^TO.*pine-info
:0: pine.lock.proc
* ^From owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu
| FolderIt pine 2
-----------------

(and this is contest of script FolderIt) 
-----------------
#!/bin/csh -f
umask 077
cp /dev/null /homes/adam/mail/spool/$1
sed -e 1d | tmail adam+mail/spool/$1
cat /homes/adam/mail/spool/$1 >> /homes/adam/mail/incoming/$1
if ( $2 == "2" ) then
        cat /homes/adam/mail/spool/$1 >> /homes/adam/mail/archive/$1
endif
-----------------
of course for you the important line is just the line 4 
where the mail is first pocessses by sed and then  by tmail
(the tmail and imap needed to compile tmail you can get from 
 ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/)

so you will want put in your procmail something like 
| sed -e 1d | tmail  vikas+mail/pine

as mine script does much more, as it saves it to incoming folder and 
also makes backup copy it if when it is said to do one. (any one want
write faster version of the FolderIt script?) Aand as a side feature 
you have the copy of lates email for each folder stored in the spool dir.

..the reason for umask and spool dir is mostly b/c tmail would complain if 
the destination folder does not exist or has wrong permissions.




Beside that you can display in one window the output of procmaillog to
see what new mail is coming in (tail -f ~/mail/procmail.log) as the
pine does not inform well about new mail when multiple folders are used.

But for this you will want make those changes to tmail.c so that it does
not print all the trash out to the procmail.log

Hi! 

 I have been using pine3.95 for quite some time now but a while
ago something strange happend on our system at school.
 All access to folders (except INBOX) takes half an eternity
(that's about 10-15 seconds). When pine tries to close a folder
(not INBOX), that is when I try to open another one, it hangs and
leaves a bunch of zombie-processes on the computer...
 There where no changes in the system (what I know about) when
this problem appeared. I have talked to our sys adm and he has no
idea on how to solve this...

 We're running Solaris on Sun Sparc 5 (and a bunch of other
computers).
 All folders are placed on our accounts... There is no decrease
of speed when accessing files on the account, like viewing the
folders with a text editor...
 The problem appeares both when reading and writing to folders.

 Please HELP me...


/ Thanx

If you have a PC, you'll need to make sure the Epson drivers for that printer
are installed. I assume that's your situation, so if you get the printer 
working for other applications, you should be able to use the 
attached-to-ansi feature under (S)etup [Printer].

Try finding the signature-at-bottom option in the Setup/Config screen.
Put an X in the box.

I can't understand why anyone would want their sig at the top.

Anyone?

Is there any way to get Pine (3.9.5q) to send messages offline? I'm aware
of "pine address < file", which nearly does what I want, but what I really
want is for it to send the file to the address as a message without any
interaction from me.

Much like Elm's "elm -s subject address < file"

How do you stop Pine from copying outgoing mail to sent-messages?

I would like to know as my server has hardly any users disk space at the
moment.

At present, no you cannot send messages "offline" using Pine.  It is
designed primarily as an _interactive_ mail client.

Try using the standard "mail" or "Mail" commands (on our SGI systems the
latter is the better).

Cheers,

Anyone got an idea how a) and b) relate to each other? Besides, in a phrase
like the tag-line, an ablativus comparationis ... Well, never mind. Here are
the three answers to today's $1.000.000 question:

1) Go the Windows way: Midnight Commander or whichever file-broser there is

Which is annoying, since its aliases are incompatible with those used by
"mail" and "Mail" (and, I'd imagine, Elm), meaning we have to maintain
at least two, separate alias lists if we do both interactive and batch
mailings.  A definite down-side to Pine.

hi, I'm writing to ask you if there is anyway to retrieve mail because
when i was writing to one of my friends sendit logged me off, and i can't
find my letter.  Does it get sent to a certain place or does it just get
deleted?

	i'm running unix pine 3.89 here at gwu, where they recently
installed pine 3.93 and then 3.95.  since upgrading to 3.9x, however, the
powers-that-be have set as unchangeable all of the settings that used to
be changeable from inside the .pinerc, which is why i am still using the
old version.  i recently noticed, however, that the personal-name for all
of the mail in my sent-mail folder is the same, even though i know that
many of the letters were sent after changing that setting in the .pinerc;
furthermore, they were all sent not as the default to which the sysadmins
here have set pine 3.9x (which i would have understood) but instead the
nickname that i was using when the switch occurred
	i went back and checked, and sure enough, no matter what i do to
that field in the .pinerc, running any of the versions of pine installed
here automatically resets the personal-name variable back to that old
setting.  is there any other file in which pine might store something like
that, and use to update the .pinerc?  or can anyone think of any other
potential causes of this problem?

Matt:

I'm not quite sure of the forwarding strategy you desire, so I'll cover
all the bases with ya....

All of the following suggestions require that you have a ".forward" file
in your home directory.  To create one, use a text editor, like pico or vi
(use pico if you're most comfortable with pine).  In that file, create
the following line(s):

If you want all incoming mail at your brain.uccs.edu address to be
forwarded (no copy at uccs.edu) write this in .forward:

	mail_account@newaddress.com

	where mail_account@newaddress.com is the fully qulaified address
	that you want all your incoming mail forwarded to.

If you want a copy in your uccs.edu address, but another forwarded to
another address write this is .forward:

	mail_account1@address1.com,mail_account2@address2.com

	where your two desired addresses are separated by commas (no
	space).  Make sure one is your uccs.edu address.

If you want to continue to receive mail, but send notification to someone
that you are currently not reading your mail (on vacation), look at the
manual page for "vacation"  on your system.  Just type "man vacation" at
your prompt.

Hope this helps!!!  Let me know directly if you have any other questions.

The command to remove files in Unix is the "rm" command. You can normally 
just type "rm <filename>", however, you must remember a couple of things, 
first, Unix is case-sensitive, and second, if you get some really strange 
filenames, such as the one with the "!" char in it, you must either put the 
filename in double qoutes after the "rm", or use the "\" before any 
occurances of the "!", and in some cases, do both.

Hope this helps. :-)

Pine needs a "stop" button.

I get particularly irritated with Pine because we use a remote news 
server.  Sometimes, when there are network or server problems, Pine 
commands like "Building folder list..." or "opening newsgroup..." just 
take too long.  In addition, sometimes, the search functions of the ";" 
and "W" keys, and folder index sorting take much longer than expected.  
Sometimes, I'd just like to be able to say "Forget it!" and move on to 
something else.

But Pine doesn't allow that, because Pine freezes everything while it's 
searching, sorting, or making network connections.  Come on, guys!  
Netscape has a "stop" button.  Lynx has the "control-G" command.  Why not 
give Pine a stop button, too?

By the way, I'm using Pine 3.91.  If some kind-of interrupt/stop feature 
has been implemented in 3.95, let me know, and I'll try to get my 
Free-net to upgrade.

Subject: Webmaster Security Seminar

I am representing the Federal World Wide Web Consortium.  You attended
one or both of our Federal Webmasters Workshops, and so we assume you'll
be interested in the occasional announcement related to the topics of
the Web, and Federal information services.

(If you'd rather not be on this list, you can remove yourself by simply
sending mail to: "fedwebmaster-request@skydive.ncsa.uiuc.edu" with the single
word "unsubscribe" as the Subject: of the message.)


Concern has been increasing over the past few months, with the malicious
break-ins at several Federal Web sites.  Federal Webmasters need to work
together to share information that will increase the security of our Web
servers and to understand how to respond to system attacks.

On March 4, 1997, the Defense Technical Information Center will be hosting
a one day WEBMASTER/UNIX SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR SECURITY SEMINAR including
the topics: The Computer Criminal and the Internet; Network/System
Administration Security Solutions, Industry's Role in Improving Web
Security; Webmaster Security Solutions, and Available Security Support
Resources.

This will be a technical seminar, addressing the needs of technical
webmasters and systems administrators.  Participation will be limited
to the first 300 registrants and is free of charge.  Registration
and additional information is available at:

	http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/security-seminar.html

Perhaps by presenting a user with a selection of possible matching filters
and allowing the user to choose the one most appropriate to the task, not
forgetting that the most appropriate action in some cases is "no filter"...

For example, I set up a filter to decrypt a pgp message, but the particular
pgp message in fact contains an un-displayable binary file. I try to view
the message, and at the moment the filter goes off and decrypts it, and pine
then tries to display it. Same happens if I try to "export" the file. I can
only get an un-decrypted copy if I "save" it to a new folder...

The list of filters would be pre-screened so that only those appropriate
to the message contents would be presented to the user.

Also, using a list of filters would allow tedious things like argument
lists to be hidden from the user. It's much easier to say "y" than remember
that a particular printer requires (say) |lpr -Pxyz -h ...

    Sorry, but Pine does not implement killfiles in its present
incarnation.  (Some day..., some day...)  For incoming _mail_ you can
use tools like procmail or filter.  (Browse my home page to get links
to take you to a lot of good mail filtering information.)  For
newsgroups, I use a kludge called trnkill, a shell script which invokes
the newsreader trn before I start Pine to update my .newsrc file with
the practical effect of killfiling.  It isn't perfect, but it's better
than nothing.  Lack of killfiles seems to be one of Pine's major design
shortcomings.

i work as a system consultant at a university NeXT lab.  We get this 
problem rather frequently for our sister system.  It means your account 
is oversized.  You need to delete some files and or messages from your 
account.

Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, Questions & Answers, and information on where to
   obtain the software, can be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer, ... -- whichever organization provided you with
   the email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number
   of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users at other
   organizations.
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
     * If you are posting a question to the Pine Discussion Forum but do
       not subscribe to it, request in your message that replies be sent
       directly to you, with a copy to the forum. (Conversely, if you are
       answering a question in the Pine Discussion Forum, be sure to
       include the inquirer's email address in your reply, since s/he may
       not be a subscriber and will otherwise not see your answer).

  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does my message index show From: instead of To:?
  
   Applies to Pine for Unix only
   
   A number of Pine 3.95 users have reported seeing their own name,
   rather than the name of the recipient, in folder index listings of
   messages they have sent. This occurs when Pine detects the specific
   hostname of the computer on which it is running in the From: header.
   To avoid this from happening, set use-only-domain-name in Pine's SETUP
   CONFIGURATION menu to Yes; this strips the name of the specific host
   from your From: address. Alternatively, specify your domain name in
   user-domain (be sure you enter it correctly, otherwise all your
   outgoing messages will have an invalid return address! Ask your local
   computing support people if in doubt). When setting either of these
   options, also read the help screen for
   quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file to see whether you should enable that
   feature too.
   
   Administrators of systems where Pine exhibits this behavior should
   also check the /etc/hosts file for invalid entries; as an example, it
   should read:

  123.456.78.90   hostname.domain    hostname

   not just
  123.456.78.90   hostname

   -- otherwise, users' setting of use-only-domain-name to Yes will not
   have the intended effect.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as fetchmail (which supercedes
   popclient) can be used to download email from a POP server to a local
   Unix account, where it can then be accessed with Pine. fetchmail can
   be obtained from:
   http://locke.ccil.org:80/~esr/esr-freeware.html#fetchmail
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

Hi there,

Can we create schedule's for outgoing E-mail ??? 
Example :
Suppose at 10.10 a.m. E-mail to "A" will go.
Again at      11.00 a.m. E-mail to "B" will go.

Remembering that we are not logged, when the E-mail goes from our server.

Am i asking too much  ? Any help will be highly appreciated.

Has anybody gotten pine (linux) to successfully open a ms-exchange folder with imap?  I 
keep getting either rsh-timeout errors or connection refused problems.  Have tried the 
syntax {host.domain}INBOX and the :143 hack, all to no avail.  Any ideas?

This is not something that a mail client designed for interactive use
(such as Pine) will allow you to do.

Assuming you are using a UNIX system you may be able to do what you want
by setting up a timed job using either "at" (for one-off jobs) or
"crontab" (for regularly occurring jobs) to use either "mail" or "Mail"
(instead of Pine) to send the message.

Cheers,

Subject: How to mark against delete?
Date: 16 Feb 1997 23:04:05 GMT
Message-ID: <5e83p5$416k@piglet.cc.uic.edu>

I use Pine in combination with Procmail to filter mail from several
mailing lists into folders and read it. Some of these mailing lists are
very active, and there are often 300+ messages in a mailing list folder
when I read it every 2-3 days.

I delete most of these messages and save maybe 5-6 messages. As I read
each message or subject line, I save the ones I want to a different
folder. Then I use the select ";" and apply "a" commands to select all the
messages and delete them from the folder, or else I just delete the entire
folder when I'm done saving the messages I want. Procmail automatically
recreates the folder the next time a message from that list arrives.

I was wondering if there's an easier way to do this. Specifically, if it's
possible while reading messages in a folder to flag certain messages.
Then, when I use the "select" command, be able to select all messages
EXCEPT those which have been flagged.

Any help is appreciated.

My PC setup is quite consistent; when using prYnt, it quits after printing
approx 24 lines of a message.  Config. says I'm using "attached-to-ansi" 
and I have also used "attached-to-ansi-no-formfeed" on the advice of our
Sysop (it didn't make any difference).  My communications program is
Telemate for Windows 1.1

Hello!

I've been wanting to install Pine on my home machine as a means of reading
some offline mail from a local site, it there a means to implement this or
does Pine insist of retrieving files from a remote server?

Any answers to this will be appreciated.

Have you checked through the Setup Configuration screen within Pine?  In
there you should find a very interesting looking option: 

	enable-flag-cmd

complete with built-in help!

In particular you want to use this to apply the "Important" flag on such
interesting messages.  Select can then be used to select all the other
messages using:

	; S ! *

Cheers,

I'm finding pine a little clumsy on uudecoding news articles.  Is there a
better way to do it than to have to pipe it through uudecode?  Isn't there
a way that one can mark several articles for decoding and then just do it
once when you're finished with the group?

I have a few questions regarding the OS/2 version of Pine, and Pine in
general. Some of these questions are suggestions for a new version of
Pine, if it isn't possible yet with the current 3.95 version:

  (1) Which (free, if possible) program can I use to store messages
      (either from a POP3 server, or from a UNIX mailbox file) in
      different PC Pine-folders, based on rules. It has to be a DOS or
      (preferred) an OS/2 program, and I want to be able to write to the
      folders, so they have to be written in PC-Pine mailbox format, not
      UNIX mailbox format.

  (2) Is it possible to use the newsrc file for read messages, instead of
      (or in addition to) deleted messages, so when I've read a message,
      it is either not shown, or marked as read, the next time I read that
      newsgroup. It would also be nice if I could choose whether to show
      all messages (with an indication whether they have been read or
      not), or only new messages.

  (3) It would be nice to have the option to show the total number of
      messages and the number of new messages in the folder overview
      window, for each mailbox and newsgroup.

Groeten,
  Ruud.

Is there any way to automatically change the reply/followup string
On <date>, <person> wrote:
to something else (eg. time, message ID)?

The present format (date & sender only) can appear a little vague,
especially if writing several followups to the same person on the same day.

With the cursor in the header of the outgoing message,
hit ^R for Rich Header Options. Leave the To: field
blank and put all the addresses in the Bcc: field,
separating them with a comma. Each recipient will see
that the message was sent from you to 'Undisclosed
Recipients'.

Is there a way in PINE to reformat paragraphs that you haev edited and
messed up the line wraps on?  I used to use ELM and I think it had
this feature, but if I am not mistaken, it used the stripped down
emacs editor, so it was more likely a feature of the latter than the
former.  With all of PINE's features, it seems like it oughtta do it,
but it escapes me how to get it done.  Thanks

Sure... Check the "spam-faq", which is available from a server near you.

There is an option bcc: which will let you do exactly that.

Dear Andras,

I've often wondered about this as many smaller mail applications do 
have a system of _Return Receipts_, but there is a rather important
consequence, and that is it generates more tramsmission traffic and of
course memory needs to be used to record and track each message where
a return receipt was requested.

However on systems for larger mail programs evidently this is perhaps
too much clutter as the thinking is that recipients of messages will
always indicate [respond to an RSVP] without being asked.

We know from experience to get ANY feedback as to receipt of your 
message depends completely on the individual you contacted. As a
sidenote to RSVP courtesy it was born in the day when hostesses
wanted to make sure how many guests were coming.  Return receipts were
used postally to make certain that your business letter got to its
destination.  All this when telegraph and radio were in infancy and
not too reliable.  <<Do you read me?  Come in Rangoon, come in!>>

So if you add a century to that and evaluate communication reliability
today be reassured by several orders of magnitude that your message
got through and silence from your recipient may be more probable.

- - - -

I'm writing this from sunny California, USA.  Your message did get
through, and if one part of a web [Web] feels tremors, then the
whole web is aware. 

Another clue is when your mail is not rejected by a mailing robot
which sends messages back to you nearly all the time for improper
addresses.  If you don't get those then you're okay.

- - - -

Hope your Hungarian spring comes soon . . .

Configure an appropriate viewer for text/html in your .mailcap file,
e.g.
	text/html; lynx -force_html %s; needsterminal

Using the above, Pine will invoke Lynx to view the HTML.

I am having trouble configuring pine to print to local printers on NT 4.0
and Win95 machines.  The attached to ansi option that works so well for win
3.1 fails for these two cases.  If I am glancing over something please let
me know.  If there is some nifty trick to it that would be great
information as well.

Subject: PC-Pine print problem when use command "y"
Date: 17 Feb 1997 06:25:26 GMT
Message-ID: <5e8tkm$73a@ustsu10.ust.hk>

Dear All,

We have compiled the 32 bit PC-Pine using MS Visual C++ 4.2.  The following
are customizations that we make in the source: 

 	- remove the debugging option
	- redefine HORIZONTAL_MARGIN 
	- redefine PINE_VERSION
	- redefine DF_LOCAL_FULLNAME and ADDRESS

After the compilation, we find that all the major functions are operating
fine except the "y"(prYnt) command.  When using the "y" command to print,
PC-Pine always gives the error message "Error starting print job: Can't
start document".  Printing is OK, however, when print from the FILE menu.

We have downloaded the precompiled version from the Web site of U of
Washington and find it does not have such print problem.  Do any of you
know where the problem is and the trick to solve it?  Is there a bug in
the source code that causes the problem?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: ANSI Colors using UNIX Pine?
Date: 20 Feb 1997 19:48:15 GMT
Message-ID: <5ei9pv$na9@netaxs.com>

Hi,
 I noticed that ANSI color support is included in the pc code but there 
isn't a stand alone -DANSI_COLOR or something that I could use to enable 
-c in pine/pico unider unix. Is there and easy way to do this? I tried 
forcing the issue but it seems that the dos/ansi color code is too 
intermixed for a quick hack. I was just wondering since both lynx and tin 
have both been ansi-colorfied.

Thanks,

Hello,

I have a question about the way Unix Pine 3.95 sorts the subjects in a
NewsGroup.

I use the sort by "subject" method, which gives me a alphabetical listing
of the NewsGroup, but it is not sorted my date.

If I use "ordered-subject" the NewsGroup is sorted by date, but not
alphabetically.

Is there any way that future releases of Pine that it might combine the
sorting methods? So that the subjects are sorted alphabetically and then by
date?

Is this something in the configuration that I have overlooked?

All comments welcomed,


Michael (shotgun@best.com)

I have the solution to your problems.  You have X, so there is no better 
app for you than XBuffy.  It will watch as many folders as you want.  I 
currently use procmail to filter on 7 folders, and eash is listed in a 
small window, a little bigger that the xbiff with each folders name.  When
new mail arrives, it changes inverse color, and or flashes the subject
and who it's from.

It's the best app I have running on my machine!  You can get the source from:
ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/X11/contrib/utilities/xbuffy3.2.1.tar.gz

Enjoy!

Greetings:

I quite often keep copies, via Pine's Fcc field, of messages that I send
out with entries in the Bcc field. When I later view these messages, I am
able to view the Bcc recipients, and I consider this a feature :-) 

However when I forward such messages, I would like have Pine
*automatically remove* the Bcc field and associated entries, *prior* to
forwarding.

Does this functionality exist in Pine 3.95? If so, please share your
secrets.  

If not, perhaps this is a small suggestion for a future release of this
wonderful mail-user agent :-) 

TIA, Ian.

Is there a way to automatically set the TERM variable in order to work
with Pine? (I mean from as root). 

I have a VT220 terminal attached to my server and since I upgraded from
Slackware 3.0 to 3.1, when you log in from this terminal the TERM var is
set to vt220 and you need to set it to TERM=linux in order to open PINE.
How do I fix it? (I only know about /etc/profile to set env variables)

Please e-mail me the answer,

	Thanks/Gracias,
			Gil

Use the Lcc header (hit ctrl-R for Rich Header to see it).

You can make up a list of recipients in the Addressbook and enter the name
for it in the Lcc line. The list name will go to the to field and the
message will go the recipients, but they wont see the other names on the
list. If you don't want to make up a list alias in the addressbook (say,
for example, it is a one-time mailing) then send a copy to yourself in the
To line and put everyone else's name in the Bcc: line (only visible in
Rich Header).

Well, if it makes you feel any better, your name is beside your message on
*my* copy, and I suspect everyone else's. It is just your copy that is
that way. This way you can tell easily which ones you wrote so you can
avoid wasting time reading them again, or single them out and read them
over and over and over again, if you prefer. :-)

Nope... but you can invoke another editor (see Setup, Config). *really*
*smart people use joe, really* weird people use vim (Huhu, Sven!) or another
*monster. If you know elm, you'll probably like jmacs (joe in emcas mode...
*but not Eight Megs And Constantly Swapping).

	JOE is available over the Internet by  anonymous

Enjoy.

I should've gone to sleep 4 hours ago, so I might be wrong :) but assuming
that you're running bash for the shell, try typing "export TERM=linux"
before you run Pine.

  Hi.

   Instead of saving it into sent-mail folder directly, I would like to do
some additional processing on *every* msg that's being sent before saving
it to the sent-mail folder.

   How do I do that ?

   I can think of a few ways :
      o  define a sending filter, but then I couldn't combine it with
other sending filters, like PGP.
      o  send a copy to a user that will do the processing via procmail,
but this is not elegant at all -- I would rather call procmail directly,
as in third option :
      o  in Fcc field, instead of specifying "sent-mail", specify
something like : "|my_process" which would execute this process instead !


      It appears to me that the third option is the most elegant one, but
requires some coding. Could someone :
      o  advise me on a better way to do it, OR
      o  help me get it coded ?

        Thanx,

            Jan

Correct.

Not quite.... sorting by "Date" sorts by date.  "OrderedSubject" groups
messages sharing the same Subject text (ignoring leading "Re:"'s) 
together, and then sorts this sublist by Date.  The main aim of
OrderedSubject is to provide pseudo-threading for folders (mail or news).

I admit that I've always been semi-puzzled why the Index screen doesn't
then end up with the subjects arranged alphabetically.  However I
_suspect_ Pine is attempting to maintain the Date ordering of the start of
each thread of conversation (in case, I suppose, some thread has its
Subject changed as the discussion wanders ... this would hopefully end up
further down the Index so you'd always encounter it _after_ reading the
original material) 

If I'm right (and it _is_ only supposition) the algorithm is not simply
the obvious:

	1.  Sort articles using primary key of Subject and secondary key
	    of Date.

but is instead the more complex (and theoretically useful):

	1.  Group articles into "threads" by common Subject (ie, get
	    related articles together)

	2.  Sort each "thread" by Date (ie, order the articles within each
	    "thread" into the order they were written).

	3.  Sort the different "threads" by Date (ie, order the separate
	    conversational "threads" into chronological order by their
	    first article).

Perhaps you (or someone with a bit of spare time) would care to peer at
the source code and see if this is indeed what is happening (or else
suggest what the true algorithm is)?

Cheers,

	I tried to send a message to a friend with an attachment, and 
this is what he got:

	When I tested it by sending it to myself (on a second account), 
the attachment came out fine.  When I resent it to him, he received the 
same (encoded?) message.  Does anyone know what I sent to him, and why it 
came out the way it did?  I am using Pine 3.91 on a VAX.  Thank you.

    I believe this needs a slight correction.  If you use Bcc:, then 
DO NOT leave To: blank.  If nothing else, put your own address in there,
and then discard the copy you receive.  Depending on the mail transfar
agent, some people who have used Bcc: while leaving To: blank have had
the unfortunate experience that the transfer agent creates an
Apparently-to: header for every address listed in Bcc:!  This does not
happen every time, necessarily, but unless you are certain that it does
not happen on your system, be sure to put SOMETHING in To: when using
Bcc:.  The latest versions of Pine have an Lcc: option which gets
around this problem.

	I'd like to ask about filtering. I receive email with different
To-lines and so I want to filter my mail to different folders by
recipient. I've seen the info: it tells me some words like BEGINNING and
RECIPIENTS, which I can use, but how?
	Could someone tell me an example? I've got certain files (folders)
to which I want my mail to go so that I can read them there.

	I am confused as to why Pine would convert the attachment in 
MIME, and then not unconvert it for the recipient, considering that we 
are both using Pine 3.91 on the same VAX.
	Thank you for your help, Mike Brudenell.

Sure, check Nancy McGough's filtering faq. Also, check the entire procmail
package *thoroughly*. Everything you need is in there. If in doubt, consult
the procmail mailing list.

Just curious about something. How does Pine 3.95 handle external Unix signals
like HUP, TERM, QUIT, etc. 

I dont want to delve through the code to get the answer if anyone out there
knows it already.

Thanks,

Another query:

Is there a documented/undocumented way to get a running Pine session to create
a dump of the pinerc file it is operating under.

Would be useful if say, I deleted my $HOME/.pinerc and still had a Pine
session running, luckily. All I have to do is get Pine to re-create the
.pinerc it is running under.

Thanks,
--Vikas

I am interested to hear if other pine users have problems running it on
IBM 6000 machines with the latest version of the operating system, AIX
4.2. The unix mail command appears to work correctly, but pine hangs when
an attempt is made to send mail (it handles incoming messages OK).

The problem appears to be related to the new version of sendmail.

I would appreciate responses by private email, as I don't subscribe to
this list.

Roger Howard.

I use PINE 3.95 for both mail and news. Like so many others, I would like
to filter out spam in the newsgroups. I don't have any problem with my
mail, only news.

I know PINE does not have killfiles but I'm interested in knowing some of
the details of how I could filter newgroups. I tried reading the man page
on procmail, which others have suggested is useful for filtering, but it
mostly described using it to filter mail.

I really appreciate any help on this. TIA.

Excellent idea. I never thought of that. Oh well.. Blame it on Friday.. ;-)

Yes, Pine *does* create a new .pinerc if one does not exist. Just
entering/leaving setup/config is *not* enough. You have to make a actual
change and of course, answer Yes to the 'Save changes?' prompt.

But here is what I did..I deleted my $HOME/.pinerc  I just went down to one of
the features in the feature-list and hit 'Enter' *twice*. This toggled it
twice, thus keeping it the same ! This time, Pine *did* think that something
had changed and so it prompted me to 'Save changes?' and when I replied 'Y',
it *created* a new .pinerc

Thanks a lot,

We of the  Federal Webmasters Consortium would like to extend our
sincere apologies for the intrusion, inconvenience, and
annoyance our mail caused the readers of your list Wednesday and yesterday.

By means we're not yet certain of, "pine-info@cac.washington.edu"
was somehow accidentally included in our normal distribution list.
It has since been removed.

It was never our intention to send mail to your list, nor to cause the
confusion we did.

Again, we apologize for this unfortunate mishap.

Sincerely,

NSF/NCSA Federal Consortium Webmasters

    I know I can do that with procmail. But I don't know how to tell Pine
that I want to process all msgs with one of the sending filters, and then,
transparently, with the procmail filter, instead of saving it into
sent-mail.

    Pine does not do email filtering.  It was not designed to do so. 
You need a tool which will deliver the mail to different incoming
folders before you start Pine.  If you have a World Wide Web browser,
browse my home page and follow the link to Nancy McGough's informative
page.  A few levels in you will come to considerable useful material on
mail filtering.

	For some reason, when I try to forward mail or compose from

	My standard proceedure is to Ctrl+T to get to the address book

will not copy the address.  I have no idea why not.  It use to work last 
time I was set up on pine.  It has nothing to do with the machine, or 
server.  Please help  

	thanks

    Assuming you are using a fairly current version of Pine, go 
into your configuration and read the online help for index-format.

At our school, the file(s) to look for are /usr/spool/mail/username.lock.
Harvard is running Digital Unix and so things might be different but I
know we have this mailbox locking problem pretty frequently and deleting
that file solves everything.

Hi all,

We here at Northeastern Illinois University are currently using Pine for
campus e-mail provided by our ISP (on Sun servers).  We are moving to a
new provider and need to move all the e-mail functionality to our own
servers.  This will require running the new and the old system in
parallel for a couple of months and then doing a final cutover if
everything works fine. Our old pine is running on a Sun and the new one
is on DEC Alpha.

To make this transition smooth for our users we need some consulting
help.  

If you have experince or know somebody who does and will be interested,
can you please contact me at the address given below.

Thanks

   I read the whole FAQ, but didn't find a way to tell Pine to process
every msg with a certain process before saving it to sent-mail.

     Any hints ?

           Thanx,

Please do not advise, if you don't know better: You definitely CAN use
spaces in filenames in most/all(?) Unix file and operating systems.

I'd expect Pine to write a new .pinerc file if you go into setup config
and change a value - any value - and then shut down Pine.  Of course, you
then have to remember what you changed so you can change it back.

Why don't you copy .pinerc under another name, start pine, delete .pinerc,
and see if this works?  If it does, you might try again to see if going
into setup config without changing a value is enough.  And then let us
know what happened.

No. Inside TIN (my Newsreader) I just press "r" for Reply and it starts
automatically Pine with the
"pine <addr> < text"
command.
Text is created by TIN an contains the article to which I answer with quote
marks in front of each line. If I could get an command for include a
subject I could integrate it into the command issued by tin.

As you see I do not type in the email address myself. TIN does that for me ;-).

Yeah, right! >;-> Besides, it u*ix, not *nix. *giggle*

BTW, it's horribly bad style to use spaces in u*ix filenames. Anyone wants
to start a flamewar on a personal basis?

man procmail. man formail. man pine... In the latter, it says "no
filtering..." 

DESCRIPTION 
       formail is a filter that can be used to force mail into mailbox
       format, perform From ' escaping, generate auto-replying headers, do
       simple header munging/extracting or split up a
       mailbox/digest/articles file. The mail/mailbox/article contents will
       be expected on stdin.
	[giant blablabla to follow...]
	
How come I always get this weird feeling somethings *very* fishy when I hear
someone say the magic words: "I read the whole FAQ, but didn't find a way to
..."

Don't take this personally (that was just a touch of politeness---please do
take it personally), but this is the wrong list to discuss filtering
matters. Really.

Cheers,
Robin

It's one of those weekends...

on which people get high on Coke and French fries and start messing around
with their systems. Sometimes, these people stumble across strange programs
and then... they decide that this:

Could someone give me a little help with implementing ddate into pine
instead of date? It would be pretty easy for someone who knows the source, I
guess. ddate is available at:

and it rules!

Besides, I'd like to customize the reply-message in the above-mentioned way,
but randomly, i.e. invoking a small program that will provide me with more
than just the usual "wrote" ...

TIA and have a nice weekend.

Assuming you are using a Unix machine, try:

	rm \!yourfile
	rm "!yourfile"

or lastly, alias rm to rm -i (how you do this will depend on which shell
you are running), and do a rm * (saying no to every file but the one you
wish to delete).

Pine experts, I've just converted to pine from elm about 60 minutes
ago.  I was wondering what peoples opinions of the newsreading
capabilities of pine were?  How do they compare to trn which I
currently use?  All opinions appreciated.

Secondly, I tried to post to this news group from pine and I got a "No
permission to talk error."  I was wondering anyone could help me out
with this or is it just the sys admin at netcom that is not allowing
this.

Thanks in advance.

As far as can determine, pico does not read the .pinerc when run as a 
standalone program. (At least it didn't complain when I replaced 
.pinerc with garbage.)

In that case you need to do

pico -r75

    Procmail does not filter news.  It only deals with mail.  I was
the one who suggested running trnkill before reading news with Pine. 
It is a short Un*x script, and I will append it below my signature. 
There are several aspects that are necessary to know about using it.

1)  Obviously, it only works on Un*x systems.

2)  trn must be installed on your system and in your $PATH.

3)  You must have killfiles.  That is a small subject in itself which I
    won't go into here, although they are not too difficult to set up
    for basic operations.  man trn  can supply some information.

4)  There is one minor glitch in the interface with Pine.  Suppose at
    the moment, the highest-numbered message on your system for
    newsgroup soc.culture.junk.trash is 12345.  It just so happens 
    that that article meets a killfile criterion, so trnkill updates
    your .newsrc to mark 12345 as read.  Now you are going from
    newsgroup to newsgroup in Pine with the <tab> key.  If the next
    group you tab to is soc.culture.junk.trash, Pine sees that the
    highest-numbered article in the group right now is the same as the
    highest-numbered article marked as read in .newsrc, so it skips the
    whole newsgroup.  Pine does not notice that there are some
    intermediate numbers which have not been marked as read.  However,
    you can manually go back to the folder display, highlight the
    group, and open it "by hand."

Does the .newsrc file have to be on the local machine running pine?  Is
there some way I can keep my newsrc file on, say, the imap server?  I read
news from work and from home and I'd like to keep the newsreading "synced
up" between home and work.  Any suggestions?

Err... I don't think that's a good idea... Rather, try man rm and man shell
(maybe man bash or whatever...)  and READ man rm. Paul's idea will
*probably* work, but with the "rm *" command, I'd really be careful.

Hmm .. in bash-v2.00 does rm \!file and rm '!file' work as do rm -i 
?file (could be several files) ..

 rm "!file" don't work (history expansion) ..

[But if you need to be "really" sure be sure that the file will be removed
type rm -rf / (readmail -realfast). Disclaimer: I will take no
repsonsibility if anyone types this command.]

That's a one very good line .. if your signature where a little more
compact (less spaces in it/only two seperators/less lines) It would too be
a great one .. :-)

Some people have erroneously suggested putting the filename in double 
quotes; However this only works for most special characters, not ! and 
$. Single quotes are more reliable.

rm '!whatever'

And as mentioned, you can also put \ before special characters.

I just downloaded PC-pine to my computer and tried to install it without

However, PINE keeps saying "connection refused" without asking me to type

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

What's that assignment? Contributing to a.s.s. or breaking the record for "ME
TOO's" sent on one day?

Check the internet for anonymous mail-servers. a.s.s. (which you probably
know already) should give you many examples.

This is _not_ a pine related question.

Sorry for this lengthy piece of email, but a) darling Emil screwed up the
quotations, and b) there is something in the message (type rm -rf /
(readmail -realfast)) that needs a little clarification:

This is neither funny nor responsible. In short: This command will make an
attempt at removing (rm) everything on your disk recursively (/ -r), without
waiting for your permission (-f force). This won't work, of course, but
might do some damage to your homedir.

It originated as a joke in response to a spammer's request for help:

:>In article <32C42B6C.771F@dolomitensport.telecom.at> in newsgroup
:>comp.mail.pine, LRC-Lienzer Dolomiten <lrc@dolomitensport.telecom.at>

:>How can i send 1000s of emails ??
:type
:'rm -rf * pine'
:at a Unix shell prompt.
:The "rm" means "read mail" and the "-rf" option means "really fast", which
:is most appropriate when you are sending out more than 100 pieces at a
:time. The "*" means for the "readmail" command to send to as many addresses
:as it can find, and the "pine" of course means to use pine to do it.
:The "readmail" command is named that way for historic reasons.  Don't ask.

To put it in a "poetic" way:

You say: "readmail -realfast"
and you claim these words as your own
but I'm well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
don't plagarise or take "on loan"
there's alway someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
  when you fall.

Morrissey would probably kill me for this >;-> It's Cemetry Gates off the
Smiths' "The Queen is dead".




Now for the rest (which is totally irrelevant, so don't read any further).

/--->FLAME ON

I suppose you're not billd@voicenet.com  (Bill D), so here's my very
personal opinion of this suggestion:

1) We've had this before, but at the time it was a) appropriate and b)
funny. 
2) I strongly suspect that you've never touched a computer running u*ix
before, otherwise you'd know that the command won't do what you seemingly
think it will.
3) For historic reasons, I don't like Swedes. I don't like pathetic little
show-offs, either. You seem to be both. Could you please stick you head up a
dead pig?

..."too"... like whose? If your "mails" were a little shorter (like 0kb?),
you might make less innovative contributions to the yet unwritten pamphlet
"How to rape the English language".

Don't bother responding.

From pine's built-in help:

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++---+---+---+---+---++
# Full path and name of NEWSRC file
newsrc-path=

        OPTION: newsrc-path
This option overrides the default name Pine uses for your "newsrc" news
status and subscription file. If set, Pine will take this value as the full
pathname for the desired newsrc file.

If this option is not set, Unix Pine looks for the file ~/.newsrc and
PC-Pine looks first for $HOME\NEWSRC (where $HOME defaults to the root of
the current drive, e.g. "C:\" ) and then it looks in the same directory as
your pinerc file for NEWSRC.

 We have a problem with Folder Index SENDER field identification. It seems
that pine doesn't recognize a mail sent/saved by myself. Usually it
correctly reports a 'To: ...' line but sometimes it writes my name
instead.
 The problem seems to be related to not fully qualified address in
'From:' line. Pine doesn't recognize an unqualified hostname as a local
domain host.
 Now we are using version 3.95q, the old 3.91 version doesn't seem to be
affected by this problem, mail messages are correctly reported with 'To:'
also for unqualified address.

 How we could reconfigure pine 3.95 for the old behavior? This problem
makes big folders completely unreadable.

(please reply also by email)

Something strange is happening with my inbox.  all of a sudden I am unable
to delete any of the incoming messages.  Instead I get the cue: "[Can't
delete message.  Folder is read-only.]"

I have done nothing in Config file or anywhere else.  Someone please
tell me how to delete from the inbox.

Thank you.

Hi there,
Can we create schedule's for outgoing E-mail ???
Example :
Suppose at 10.10 a.m. E-mail to "A" will go.
Again at      11.00 a.m. E-mail to "B" will go.
Remembering that we are not logged, when the E-mail goes from our server.

For a detailled answer, we need a little more information about your system.
What flavour of u*ix are you running, where is your inbox, are you running
pine locally or on a remote system, blablabla... ?

However, the error-message is pretty much self-explanatory. The folder in
which your incoming mail is stored has been made read-only for you. Talk to
your sysadmin to change that. IMVHO, that's a lot easier than exchanging
everybody's favourite remedy here :-)

If you insist on checking what's wrong, though, check where your "inbox" is
(Setup, Config, inbox-path) and then try to do a
	ls -alF <path/inbox>
to check ownership and permissions for that file. Maybe you've
*accidentally* changed something there. Then
	chmod u+w <inbox>
would do the trick. Don't forget to consult the appropriate man pages ;-)

Has anyone been able to compile tmail under OS/2 using gcc?

I want to process messages (retreived from a POP-server) with procmail
(which I have been able to compile, but some things don't work correctly
yet), and store them into Tenex/MTX-format, so I can read them with Pine
for OS/2. 

I've downloaded imap-utils.tar.gz, imap.tar.gz and pine.tar.gz (all from
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/), but when trying to compile tmail, I
get all kinds of errors. I've been able to solve some of them, but most
errors not.

Does anybody perhaps have working executables for tmail and/or procmail,
or could someone who is better at porting than me, try to compile them
succesfully? Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,
  Ruud.

I don't know what the poster was trying, but in any case there isn't a
uniform pico interface, so if he uses it both ways he needs both methods.

Something for a future release?

Hi All:  First of all thank you for the Pine slow link solution.
Please tell me if there is a similar fix for folders, as they still

Thank you much

Hi:

Does anybody know how to forward an e-mail from 'A' account to 'B' account
automatically?  In addition, it will left a copy on 'A' account which means
both 'A' and 'B' get e-mail.

Thank in advacne

    First, you must be using a sufficiently recent version of Pine in
order to have Lcc:.  (I do not recall exactly with what version it came
in.)  Lcc: and Bcc: are similar in purpose -- to conceal recipients of
the same email from one another for some reason -- but Lcc: is cleaner
to use.  For technical reasons, you should make some kind of entry in
the To: header field when using Bcc:.  This is not necessary with Lcc:.
Also, with Lcc:, the nickname of the distribution list is what appears
to the recipients when they open the mail.  (This is going from memory,
as I have not had reason to use Lcc: myself.  Others on the newsgroup
can correct or amplify my answer.)

Hi.........!
	I have PINE 3.91 running in Linux which came with slackware.
When I receive the message with content type message/partial as the
only part of the message pine could show me only the raw text of 
base 64 coded message. I have a mailcap file defining showpartial
content type and the showpartial program came metamail program also
installed in the path. But in my knowledge pine consults the mailcap
file only for attachments. How to configure pine to display this type
of message. The original message was send using mailto of metamail.

	At present I am not in this list. So please set your

I've included a small script by Leif Erlingsson
<Leif.Erlingsson@mailbox.swipnet.se> that will 
"Queue Remote Mail + Deliver Local Mail".

You'll still need to set up a cron-job on the server. Still, the script is
IMVHO *really* neat, so I dare put it on the list. 
Flame me at random if you like ;-)

BTW, I still haven't received an answer for a problem I've been whining
about before: When there are more than two potential recipients in a reply,
how can I tell pine that I might want only a few of them, but not "all
recipients"? *nag*

If you are using NNTP to _read_ Usenet News (it's always used to _post_
News articles) then your .newsrc file has to be visible to your local
machine.  By this I mean it is usually on its hard disk, but may in some
setups be one a disk mounted over the network using (for example) NFS.

The actual location of this newsrc file can be set in the Setup
Configuration screen.

However it is also possible to _read_ Usenet News over an IMAP connection
(instead on an NNTP one).  This assumes, of course, that your IMAP server
machine has been configured to allow this!

If you _do_ elect to use an IMAP connection to read News then the IMAP
server itself maintains the newsrc file, rather than your local machine
upon which your client software is running.  This therefore means the same
newsrc file gets used (by the IMAP server) regardless of the client
software you are using or where it is running from.

To set this up on your client you need to:

	*  Set up the nntp-server variable as usual (so that you can
	   _post_ News articles).

	*  Set up the news-collections variable to a value along the
	   lines of:
		Usenet News	*{news.york.ac.uk}[]

Because this latter omits the "/nntp" protocol specifier it defaults to
use an IMAP connection to the host.

However, as I said before, this will only work if your IMAP server has
been configured to provide access to Usenet News.

Cheers,

If your A account is a unix account,

in your home directory, in file .forward (make sure you put in the "."),
usernameonB@somewhere.com

will forward the mail to B.  But, it won't leave it on A, so
\usernameonA usernameonB@somewhere.com  

will do it.  Maybe.  Sorry, I don't remember the exact syntax.  Anybody?
".forward" also needs to be world-readable, I think.  "chmod o+r .forward"

Just the opposite on B, if you want mail arriving at B to go to A as
well.  Caveat - this *may* create an endless mail loop.  See man procmailex
and man procmail for ways around this.

    Well, you quit whatever Pine session you are in -- i.e., what you
see on your display -- in the normal way with Pine's standard Quit
command.  From here on out, it is no longer a Pine question but a Un*x
question.

    On most Un*x systems, the 'ps' command will display all running
processes for your login session.  It may be possible to bring a
background Pine session to the foreground with an appropriate use of
the 'fg' command; if that is successful, you can quit it like any other
Pine session.  Otherwise you will have to use the 'kill' command (in
extreme cases the 'kill -9' command).  Documentation for all these
commands should be available online from your shell prompt via the
'man' command (as this is not really a Un*x tutorial newsgroup).

    If you still have problems, contact me privately, although I am 
not a Un*x guru and am not online 24 hours a day.

You probably _are_ doing something wrong ;-)

The "bad context" message you're seeing is because the folder
specification is missing the "[]" placeholder string.  This is the point
at which Pine inserts the name of the folder you're trying to open.

Thus, for example, a folder-collection should be specificed along the
lines of:

folder-collections       = Mail {imap.york.ac.uk}Mail/[]

This is taken from my own settings, which use IMAP to access the folders
stored in the subdirectory called "Mail" within my home directory.

If you can't spot where your problem lies e-mail a copy of your .pinerc
file to the list and I'm sure some pair of sharp eyes will be able to
assist.

Cheers,

I have Pine configured to access multiple incoming mail folders on my
IMAP server.  Being the system manager of the IMAP server (<grin>), I can
review the connection logs.  I notice that Pine seems to be establishing
a new connection (including login) each time I move between folders.
Is there a way to cut-down on this, so that Pine logs in only once and
uses the same connection regardless of which folder I'm looking at?
The current method seems like something of a network waste.

doesn't it give my name? Any help gratefully accepted.

That is the attachment type used when the sending mail program doesn't 
know what type the file is. And of course, that makes pine at the 
receiving end unable to know, as well.

In other words, it could be almost anything. The best bet is to look 
at the filename it suggests when saving, and run the appropriate 
program "by hand" on the saved file.

You may want to start with 'less filename' in case the format is 
something resembling ordinary text.

A couple of common file types:

 .gif, .jpeg - use an image viewer, e.g. xv.
 .doc - Microsoft Word documents, you need to get it to a PC.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

What is QDOS++???  I just tried to set enable-background-sending in
the Windows 95 version of Pine and it's not in the list of possible
variables.  Does anyone know why this variable isn't in this
version? 

Thanks,

Well, I was not trying to invoke Pico by Pine.  I was using Pico directly
from command line.  I was trying to figure out whether there was an
environment parameter that affects Pico in the same way as the -r option. 
I am well aware of the configuration options in the .pinerc file for Pico
under Pine.

So, can one specify an environment so that Pico can be launched with a
right margine of, say, 75 columns, independent of Pine?

Thanks for your responses though!

I seem to have a problem after I log in and write pine.  The process goes
through, but before it does, the computer beeps and says, "incomplete
maildomain cc.serve."  The it tells me the address may be incorrect.  Why
is it saying this?  Is there anything I should do?  Or should I just
ignore it?  Thanks for your help.  Roberta Rosenberg, National Chengchi

Steve,
Pine 4.x will take advantage of the STATUS command in the IMAP4rev1 spec
to cut down on the number of separate sessions.  This should help quite a
bit; however, it will always be necessary to open an additional stream
when a second folder is actually opened, as the INBOX stream is always
kept open.   (And IMAP sessions can only have one folder open at a time;
i.e. it relies on TCP's multiplexing abilities, rather than defining
--reinventing-- such capabilities in the application protocol.)

It's true that this does result in some additional authentication
overhead, however.

Extract from the built-in help for the Index screen ("?" command):

=====
SENDER: The name or email address of the sender.  If you are the sender,
then the first recipient's name is shown here.  In Newsgroups, if you are
the sender and there are no email recipients, the newsgroup name will be
listed.
=====

This is done because Pine assumes that you know your own name, and hence
can *imply* the message is from you by the presence of the "To:" prefix.
The remaining space is then used to display the first recipient or
newsgroup name.

Only your own Index screen is affected; other people see you name in the
Index screens.

This feature is incredibly useful when viewing the Index of folders
containing outgoing messages (eg, your "sent-mail" folder if you have
one), or a mix of incoming and outgoing messages.  It really does help you
locate a particular message "by eye".

If you *really* can't live with this feature you can redefine the
appearance of the Indx screen in Pine's Setup Configuration screen.  Look
for the "index-format" variable and read its built-in help.  (Hint: set up
a definition similar to the default given in the help screen, but with
FROMORTO replaced by FROM.)

Cheers,

Is there currently any way to attach one of two signature files
depending
on whether the mail is leaving your domain or not?  I believe elm
supports
this.  I wouldn't care, but my employer wants all e-mail leaving to have
a
company signature file instead of my private sig.  Would it be possible
to
include this capability in a future release of Pine?

Type C(ompose), ^T (To AddrBk), L (ListMode), and X [Set/Unset] the people
you need. That's in Pine 3.95.

Hallo Vicki,
you can configure your needs. Type 'S','C' in the main screen and see HELP
on items 'sending-filters' and 'compose-send-offers-first-filter'.
Hope, this could help.

Choose "setup/configure" from pine main menu, then change one setting.
When you exit configuration it will ask if you want to save changes.
Answering "yes" will write new .pinerc with options you had set plus the
one change you made.

There are those who would have us believe that if we surrender

reduced. Even if this ridiculous assumption were true the loss 
of personal freedom is _not_ an acceptable trade-off.

Hello,

I am attempting to build pine on unixware.  When I give the build uw2 
command I am getting the following errors.  Any suggestions would be 
greatly appreciated.

Making c-client, mtest and imapd
UX:sh (build): ERROR: make: not found

Making Pico and Pilot
UX:sh (build):  Error:make: not found

Making Pine
Ux:sh (build): ERROR:make: not found

Links to executables are in bin directory:
Ux:sh (build) : ERROR: size not found
Done.

Also the bin directory is empty.

Thanks!

   Very easy, you can send email simply using: mail -s 'subject' user@domain
   and if you want schedule this, simply enter it into a crontab...
   ex: 10 10 * * *  mail -s 'Hello' grenleaf@bom2.vsnl.net.in
       00 11 * * *  mail -s 'Hello2' your_userB@...

  and every days, at 10.10, you'll received a mail...
   You can even send a file by mail like this: mail user@... <file_name

   Hope this help you.... :-)

I just couldn't resist this one.

Dear boy, there are many reasons why you may not be receiving your mail.
Very few of them relate directly to Pine, but you may want to make sure
you have your INBOX path set correctly for starters.

Aside from that, have you checked with your System Admin regarding possible
problems? This would be another good place to start.

Once you can substantiate that the problem is Pine-related, write back, and
we'll try to help you out. Until then, please direct your exasperation some-
where else.

Joe:D

PS: If you read all this, then you *are* receiving mail, aren't you?!

Steve,

This isn't a matter of pine "remembering".  

In order to get around your problem, your system administrator (you?) has to 
put you in a "trusted user" file on the system such as "/etc/hosts.equiv".
The users listed in that file are not required to type in their password
everytime they start pine.

(BTW, hosts.equiv is what we use on the AIX flavor of Unix, I'm sure about
the exact name on other Unix systems).

I hope that puts you in the right direction.

Sounds like you're using "rimap" to retreive mail with IMAP, rather
than accessing the IMAP server directly.  When using "rimap", Pine
will attempt to connect to your account on the server using rsh, then
invoke rimap from there.  If the r-services are set-up and your account
information is valid on the server end, the method you describe will
work; unfortunately, our environment isn't secure enough to allow use
of the r-services, so that's not an option.

Thanks for the suggestion, though.

Hello,

I just configured PC Pine for Windows but I keep getting the "access refused" message.

My inbox file is /var/mail/spool/94251116 in my host machine, callisto.si.usherb.ca

Then the inbox path would be:
{callisto.si.usherb.ca}/var/mail/spool/94251116

Am I correct?

Another question: My sysadmin is not even sure they have IMAP configured. Running AIX 
4.1, how can he figure out if it is? Alos, I dont undesrtand how I am validated as the 
legit mail user 94251116@callisto.si.usherb.ca Does that mean anyone can read my email 
by configuring PCPINE? Where is the password configured?

Many questions, so little time..

Thanks for any advice.

Fabian Rodriguez

    First, there is no assurance that this is a Pine problem and that
therefore this is the best venue for resolving your problem.

    Second, you didn't really provide enough information for people to
make much of a start on your problem.

    Third, you identify yourself as having some kind of affiliation
with Syracuse University.  Most universities providing end-user
computing services have some sort of help desk or information center. 
They may be able to help you faster that we can, especially if it is
not a Pine problem (and not receiving mail more likely is not).

Never mind, we figured out how to do this with "formail":

	formail +1 -ds >> folderfile

worked great.

Hello!

I was wondering how to send a message automatically that tells people that
I'm not around on a certain account anymore and tell them how to reach me.
Is there a way to do this in pine (UNIX)?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Spam Blocker email address headers?
Message-ID: <856849387.3274@dejanews.com>

Hi All,
    I have seen other people adjust their email address
in the header so when they post to Usenet they don't get
a deluge of spam and ads.  We have a UW account
using Pine and would like to do this also.  We use M$
Terminal to log on if that helps.  My guess would be to
open up Setup in Pine but if someone could guide me
thru what to copy in on what line of the set up.
   We would like to change our email address to
spamblock@u.washington.edu     that way the spam
will bounce back to the unsolicited advertiser.
    Thank you for any help.  Take care, J Melusky

Anybody is welcome to join this group.
Soccer is the world game.
So let me know what do you want to know about the following League.
I watch the Italian League, Spanish League, and English League.

At the moment I think that the Spanish League is the best.
What do you think?

If I've attached a file/document to an email, and then before
sending the message realise I don't want it attached anymore,
how do I get rid of it?

Just erasing the Attachmnt: header line doesn't work as it doesn't
let me erase the attachment number, and then won't let me send the
email without putting some sort of attachment in there.

There is probably an easy solution to what I'm doing, but I'll be
buggered if I can find it.

Any help appreciated.

Just what it says, I'd say: size and make are not in your path or even not
on the system.

Which one? You could try:
	locate make / size
or
	which make / size
to see if those commands really aren't on your system.

Anyone know how I can tag all the files I want to save to the "saved"
folder?  I'd like to tag all those files then save them to the saved
folder all at once.  Right now I have to press "s" for save and save
them one at a time.

Thanks

[Posted to comp.mail.pine and Cced to the Pine Developers]

These are instructions on editing the Pine source code to fix a bug in the
way pine generates "Path:" headers when a user is posting to newsgroups.

Under the current distribution, if the use of alternate "From:" headers is
enabled a compile-time, and one uses an alternate "From:" header, the
"Path:" header that is generated by Pine is bogus.

Example:

Normally, a post from this account and machine (sjkiii, crl4.crl.com)
would partially read:

Path: ...!nexp.crl.com!crl4.crl.com!sjkiii
From: Stan Kalisch III <sjkiii@crl.com>

But let's say I want to use an alternative e-mail address in my "From:"
header, thus causing Pine to generate an "X-Sender:" or "Sender:" header.
This is what happens:

Path: ...!nexp.crl.com!crl4.crl.com!coolio
From: Stan Kalisch III <coolio@coolios.house>
X-Sender: sjkiii@crl4.crl.com

Only problem is that I am not user coolio on this machine--in fact, on
this machine user coolio doesn't exist!  Ooops...

To fix this problem, edit the imap/ANSI/c-client/nntp.c or
imap/non-ANSI/c-client/nntp.c (depending, of course, on your kind of
compiler) in your Pine source distribution, and find the following two
lines:

    sprintf (tmp,"Path: %s!%s\015\012",tcp_localhost (stream->tcpstream),
	     env->from ? env->from->mailbox : "foo");

Edit the second of these two lines so that these lines read

    sprintf (tmp,"Path: %s!%s\015\012",tcp_localhost (stream->tcpstream),
	     "not-for-mail");

This is the quickest, most painless fix you can apply to your Pine
source code for this problem, and barring ridiculous circumstances,
shouldn't cause you a problem.  Thus, the previous example

Path: ...!nexp.crl.com!crl4.crl.com!coolio
From: Stan Kalisch III <coolio@coolios.house>
X-Sender: sjkiii@crl4.crl.com

would be modified to read as the following:

Path: ...!nexp.crl.com!crl4.crl.com!not-for-mail
From: Stan Kalisch III <coolio@coolios.house>
X-Sender: sjkiii@crl4.crl.com

The "not-for-mail" follows the convention adopted in the INN
news-server software.

As this is an unofficial modification to the Pine source code, you
should add the letter "L" to your version number of Pine before
compiling, as specified in the Pine Legal Notices that come as part of
the Pine source distribution.


Best regards,

Stan

ok first before i go into this let me say if you are running pine 3.89 or
earlier, you cannot subscribe to news groups!  ok now go into your inbox
and hit "l".  then hit your right arrow then hit return or enter.  then
hit a and you shoudl be able to hit the news group!  if you dont know the
exact name you can enter just a word and then controll x in pine 3.91 or
just return in 3.95!  it wil then show you a list of news groups and then
you can arrow right to go forward and left arrow to go back!  hit return
whe you find the group you want!  to open these groups in the future go
into your inbox and hit l then right arrow then return and you will see
the groups you subscribed to!  you can then press return after hiting the
right and left arrows til you come to the one you wnt!  oh i forgot you
must press return twice after hiting the right or left arrows after first
arrowing to the proper news group when first subscribing to it!  hope this
helps marcus

Hi, 
There exist several pgp filters for unix pine.
I've made one myself as I was not satisfied by the existing ones.
Look for 'pinepgp' on http://www.aigis.demon.nl .

Two other simple ways are using Emacs' "dired" (ESC-x dired RET) or,
easier yet, Lynx's "dired" (g . RET).

I currently subscribe to a mailing list run via Listproc.  The code is so
buggy, that it assumes the "Version" line in a PGP signature is giving
Listproc some kind of command, and it returns an error--except it doesn't
inform the submitter of the post that his/her post has been rejected. 

Procmail, on the other hand, is very robust, widely respected, and
generally acknowledged as the best mail processing program available.  if
you can think of it, it can probably do it.  There's also a Procmail
mailing-list for especially troublesome questions; its address is in the
Procmail documentation.

First go to Pine's Setup Configuration screen (S then C at the Main Menu)
and make sure that the "enable-aggregate-command'set" option is checked.
Whilst there, read its built-in help (by typing ?) which explains what
this setting does, and the new commands it gives you.

Cheers,

What for? There are less annoying means to acheave that, without making
people c&p your address into the header each time they want to write to you.
Check this document for further information:
	http://digital.net/~gandalf/spamfaq.html
Filtering those addresses is certainly more effective in the long run ;-)

Probably the easiest thing to do is to use Metamail, infrastructure  for
mailcap-based multimedia mail handling. Get it from the internet, adjust the
necessary values in the mailcap file, make sure you got the paths right in
your .pinerc -- finished.

hmm may be you should try to get into a news group then tab through all
your news groups and then even though it says no more folders to tab to
press tab anyway and it will ask you if you want to return to your inbox
and hit y see if that helps!  that is my last suggestion!  marcus

Subject: cut&paste in X doesn't work for pine 3.9.5!
Date: 26 Feb 1997 14:20:23 GMT
Message-ID: <5f1gr7$ee6@camel2.mindspring.com>

Hi everyone,

	I apologize if this question has already been posed in this newsgroup. but I am
having the incredibly annoying problem of not being able to cut and paste
from pine 3.9.5 when it runs inside an xterm. I am using Debian Linux, 
kernel 2.0.27, libc.so.5.4.13, and "vanilla" xterms -- I have the
"enable-mouse-in-Xterm" option enabled, only it seems to do nothing.
DO I need to downgrade to 3.94?

Is this a known bug? How can I fix this?

Thanks in advance,

Extract from the built-in help for the "enable-mouse-in-xterm" variable in
the Setup Configuration screen:

*****
Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of X terminal cut-and-paste is
also modified.  It is necessary to hold the shift key down while clicking
left or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.
*****

    One of the most common causes for this condition on Un*x systems 
is starting two or more sessions of Pine.  It is easy to do without
realizing it, as I have found out myself.  If you start a second
session of Pine, the first session (usually in the background) holds a
lock on the INBOX, so the second session cannot write to the INBOX and
reports that it is read-only.  I cannot say for sure that this is the
cause of your situation, but it is such a common problem that it is
worth checking for.  I have found that the cleanest solution is to
gracefully quit (if possible) or kill (if necessary) ALL of the Pine
sessions and start over.

    Yes, it is certainly possible, but you have to use some other tool
in addition to Pine.  From your message header, I am not certain what
kind of operating system you are using.  If it is a version of Unix,
you can use a tool such a procmail or filter, if they are installed on
your system.  To get information on mail filtering, if you have a WWW
browser, browse my home page and follow the link to Nancy McGough's
informational material.  Several links in, she has a lot of valuable
information on mail filtering (in English).

It is documented in an Internet-Draft
(draft-ietf-asid-mime-direct-03.txt). Unfortunately, some of the syntax
has changed since the version that pine 3.95 is based on. There is also
another draft which is probably relevant and which didn't exist when 3.95
came out. It is draft-ietf-asid-mime-vcard-01.txt. I'm guessing that we
will change pine so that it generates vcard when forwarding address book
entries, and so that it recognizes both that and the pine 3.95-style
attachments.

Hello,

We have an AIX 4.1.5 UNIX system with Pine version 3.91.  Some of our
users would like to use PC Pine when accessing our system remotely. 
For this we would need to install imapd on our server.  At first glance imapd
seems secure enough in that it will disconnect after 3 consecutive bad login 
attempts.  Are there anyother security implications involved in installing 
imapd?

Please respond directly to me by e-mail.  Thanks!

Hello.
Is is possible to compile pine on an old Iris 4d/20, running Irix 3.3.1?
Thank you.

How does one get rid of a second inbox, "B", in one's Incoming Message
Folders area?  That is: After pressing Delete & confirming /Y on it,
exiting PINE to then return, I will find the little b@!#!!~# to have come
right back.  Enable Incoming Folders +/- I have tried in most but not all
executions (punning) of this.

Thanks in advance.

Sorry, I was being a little too obscure :-)
QDOS is what MSDOS used to be called before MS bought it, it stood for
'Quick and Dirty Operating System'

MSDOS++ is a possible alias for the more recent versions of dos or Windows95.

QDOS++ is obviously a very Dirty operating system :-)

Because it will only work with OS's that can multi-task, contrary to Gates
propaganda Windoze 95 does _not_ multi task. Eg. My slow old 486 can run
a tape backup, pickup email, pickup news run a BJ10E printer through a
postscript intepreter, as well as what ever I'm actually doing at that
moment all at the same time ... I don't run Windows 95.

    And additional and comprehensive technical information on your
server and your local system would be _greatly_ appreciated.  There 
is no single answer to your question.  It all depends.........

Using Pine 3.95 on SunOS 4.1.4 and Pine 3.95q on Linux.

I have been using Pine as my e-mail reader for 3-4 years now, but it
wasn't until recently that I've ever dug into any of the cool customizable
options.

One thing I've recently started to do is check multiple POP and IMAP
mailboxes, and filter my mailspool into folders with procmail.

In order to be able to send/receive e-mail for all of my e-mail addresses
from one central location, I need to be able to use a Reply-To: header.

From reading the help screens for a few features, this is what I've done:

default-composer-hdrs    = To:
                           Cc:
                           Reply-To:
                           Attchmnt:
                           Subject:
customized-hdrs          = Reply-To:


Now, when I compose a new message, a Reply-To header appears. When I send
a message with that header filled in to myself, and read it when it
returns, the Reply-To is included in the sent message, and when I select
Reply, it even asks me if I'd like to use Reply-To instead of Reply. If I
hit Yes...

Well, it lies. It isn't actually using the Reply-To, it uses the original
sender.

What must I do?

Hi,
 
I'm using PINE 3.95 for Unix.  Where do I find how to set-up Pine to 
automatically go and look for new mail.  I have set "enable-mail-check-cue" and
set "mail-check-interval" to 60, but Pine doesn't seem to check for new mail.
The only way I have been able to get new mail is to "Quit" Pine and go back in
again. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Greetings,
    I have a problem with pine and hoped someone could help me out. When I
write a letter and make a spelling errob, like right there, and then I
need to correct it without retyping the whole of my document, pine has no
mechanism to do this. I find this exceedingly lame. Must I write in WORD
and then copy and paste it to the pine compose screen to send? Is there
something I'm not understanding about the word processing capabilities of
pine?
Let me know.
Yours,
madison@sonoma.edu

After reading the mail in a folder, press the TAB key and it should search
the other folders for new mail.  Make sure you mark
'auto-open-next-unread' in the Setup for this to work.  If you want to see
if there's new mail in the current folder (e.g, INBOX), press N until
you're at the last mailing, then press N once more...if there's new mail,
it'll show up.

Currently, I use elm as my mailer, but I am moving over to pine.

I use elm from the command line to send/reply/forward mail under trn. Here are
the trn commands:

-EMAILPOSTER="elm -i %h -s 'Re: %'s' %t"
-EFORWARDPOSTER="elm -i %h -s '%'[subject]' %q"

The reason for this is so elm will copy the outgoing mail to my sent folder.

How can I do the same thing with pine?

Thanks!
Don

Best one I can come up with is to cursor up to the line where the "certain"
email address lies, and delete it, (^K works for me).

That what you wanted?

Complaining about what, exactly?

L.

is wondering if Pine plays as fast and loose with IMAP as it does
with the way it combines the news and email RFCs.

Subject: Addressbook: PC-Pine reading unix addressbook possible?
Date: 27 Feb 1997 01:39:03 GMT
Message-ID: <5f2ojn$fsj@ratty.wolfe.net>

Here's what I'm trying to do.

I've currently got Pine 3.95 running on my unix shell account.  I dial-in
and use PC-Pine and Pine/os2 from two different locations.  Ideally I'd
like to have one central addressbook so that all my changes would be
activated instantly.  The obvious choice for this is my unix addressbook
since it is always accessible.

Now my problem...I was completely unable to get PC-Pine to find my
addressbook, even when following the same format in the setup menu that I
use to have PC-Pine access my unix mail folders (which works great!).

So..my questions to the Pine gurus here are:
1) Is the above possible?
2) If so, what does a sample line look like?

thanks,
martin

After giving the Select (;) command try peering at the command menu at the
bottom of the screen.  As with other commands this changes to reflect the
commands currently available to you.

              A select All   N Number    T Text
^C Cancel     C [select Cur] D Date      S Status

So to "Select all messages" the "A select All" option looks promising ;-)

Actually, this is in the online Help (put the cursor on the To: line, and

Online help is such a wonderful thing :-)

Hi madison,

If you look at the bottom of your screen while composing, you will notice
many commands. See the "^G"? It will take you to a help screen, of which 
the upper right-hand corner is devoted to "EDITING KEYS". If you look
around the remainder of the screen, you will see other sections such as
"CURSOR MOTION" and "SCREEN/COMPOSITION". Everything you need to accomplish
composing your message with a minimum of re-typing is there, even a spell-
checker!

Have fun,
Joe:D

I have Pine 3.95 on Sun/Solaris 2.5.  How do I scroll one line at a time
when I reach the bottom of the screen?  Presently, I use "down-arrow"
key, and when I get to the bottom of the first screen, the screen jumps
to the next screen.  I want to scroll line by line, how do I do that?
It's probably under my nose, but...

I'm using Pine 3.95 and Pico 2.9 with mixed results when spell checking. 
When spell checking with Pine ispell works fine, but scrolls screen with
ispell command line options in Pico. Setting $SPELL (setenv SPELL 'ispell
-l') gives me partial functionality (offering only edit replacement
option for mispellings).

    First, ftp has nothing to do with Pine and therefore with this
newsgroup.  However, you appear to be on a Un*x-type system, so at the
shell prompt enter:  man ftp    If you have access to it, the NcFTP
front-end for ftp is much, much nicer than vanilla ftp.

    Second, a friendly suggestion.  Any time you post on *any*
newsgroup requesting assistance, try picking a more informative
Subject: line than just "help me."

Like many, I have experienced message, folder, addressbook etc. creep. 
I have some large folders and files.  Can someone give me an overall
view of how Pine works that will help me determine how I can best trim
my "stuff" to speed up Pine?  In particular, I've noticed increasingly
long delays when I

- shut down Pine
- a message is incoming.  This one is particularly annoying.  If I'm
working (composing) I'm dead in the water for a minute or two until the
new message is appropriately received.  

These may or may not be pine problems.  For example, I do mount my mail
directory from another machine etc, so the problems might be elsewhere. 
Nevertheless, an overview of what pine does when it starts up, shuts
down, gets a message etc. might help many people figure out the best way
to use it.


Thanks.

You may go to SETUP and change the configuration.  Just add the folder
name, such as:

read-message-folder	= In-Mail

Then after you read the new mail from INBOX folder, it can go to In-Mail
folder if you want.

The version of imapd distributed with Pine 3.91 is quite old.  There are
known bugs in that version.

You should use the latest imapd:
	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

Well, to get it formatted as a multireply:

1) Postpone (^O)
2) Select the messages you want
3) Apply/Reply (AR)
4) Postpone
5) Go to postponed-msgs folder
6) Save combined message to a file
7) Continue composing original message, read in the others from file.

Easier solutions are available if you don't care about quote 
characters. (Essentially, skip 3-5.)

You can also use ^R^W to read a message (by number) from the current 
folder. If you don't remember the number you have to postpone anyhow.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

The above message is not actually coming from Pine.  Normally, Pine
invokes "/usr/lib/sendmail -bs -odb -oem" and interactively negotiates
sending the mail via an SMTP exchange.  This allows Pine to negotiate
ESMTP options, such as 8BITMIME.  

It would appear that Qmail's sendmail emulator is unable to handle the
exchange with Pine and is crashing with a stack overflow.

This changes Pine's behavior to simply pass the message to the
specified command on stdin.  You lose all ESMTP capabilities in this
mode...

Does the Qmail FAQ or other documentation have any elaboration or
substantiation of this claim?

Date: 27 Feb 1997 21:10:55 GMT
Message-ID: <5f4t8v$k9e@ratty.wolfe.net>

Hi. I'm sorta new to pine and I have a few questions. I want to run pine
from a script file with no intervention from me. It needs to do everything
automatically. What I want to do is be able to set the subject and a large
blind carbon copy list and send out the mail, but it can't stop to ask
me anything. it's all got to be set up to run on its own. I've looked
through all the pine information I could find, but nothing mentioned this.
If I try to do a

pine someuser@someaddress.com < somefile

it brings up pine, fills in the send to field with
someuser@someaddress.com, fills in the message with somefile, but then it
makes me hit CTRL-X to tell it to save and send. I need this to run
automatically without my intervention.

thanks,

How do I get rid of a second inbox, "B", which I made in my Incoming
Message Folders area?  That is: After pressing Delete & confirming /Y on
it, exiting PINE to then return, I will find the little b@!#!!~# to have
reappeared.  Enable Incoming Folders +/- I have tried in most but not
all executions (punning) of this. 

Thanks in advance.

Orjan
               Can you tell me how to view images on pine?  Please
pass on step by step instructions simple enough for a 6yr old to follow if
you can.
I have a program called JPEG view on my hard drive, but I don't know how
to get the images out of pine and on to my hard drive.  Help!?!*
                                Thanks

How can I stop Pine 3.95 from asking me everytime it starts
up whether I want to delete sent-mail-jan (or dec, etc)?



If I want to fill up my disks that's my business, so how
do I tell Pine?


I can't find any setup options which seem relevant.

Hello: Anyone running the 32-bit version of PC-Pine on NT 4.0? I am 
looking for the ability to run Pine at home instead of always telneting 
into remote mail servers. And I do not want to lose the ability to 
maintain the ability to get into my mail from the road via telnet. I 
welcome your words of wisdom. Thanks.

Enjoy ~ TC

Read the FAQ which came with Qmail:

     6.2. How do I stop pine from crashing? When I ask any version of pine
     past 3.91 to send mail, it crashes.

     Answer: Put

        sendmail-path=/usr/lib/sendmail -oem -oi -t

     into /usr/local/lib/pine.conf. (This will work with sendmail too.)
     Beware that pine is neither secure nor reliable.

Dear Ye and all,

Is there a fix that maintains a full read-messages archive _and_ a regular
in-box (with read _and_ new mail)?  I'd rather not toggle between a
read-messages folder and a new-messages folder to see my entire in-box...

That turns out not to be the case.  Xterm does support cut and paste
quite nicely, thank you (or did a little genie instantly retype the
list of 243 email addresses I just pasted from an xterm window into a
Pine message?).

Two things of which you need to be aware for cut and paste with Pine
in xterms: make sure the "enable mouse in xterm" option is checked in
Pine's Main/Setup/Config; and (except for simple cursor placement)
hold down the shift key while using the mouse in Pine.  Why the Pine
designers decided that their program needed shift-drag or shift-click
instead of the more conventional usage, I don't know, but that's the
way it is.

Having become used to the shift oddity, I use cut and paste in Pine a
fair bit.

    Strange.  I have the above statement (or something very much like it
-- going from memory here) in my .mailcap, and it works just dandy: no
crashing, no burning, by either Lynx (v2.6) or Pine (v3.94) under
SunOS 4.1.4.  It has worked without a hitch every time I get an email
with both text/plain and text/html Mime parts.  Perhaps there is
something in your configuration that is unhappy.

    The one things I don't like is a matter of operating preference. 
If I get such an email, Pine tells me that the two parts are present
and that I have to go into View to see either of them.  So far I ahve
not found a way -- if there even is one -- to make Pine select one of
them automatically and show it to me without further intervention.

Sute: use the "Lcc:" field rather than the "To:" field for the e-mail
addresses:

1.  Start composing your message.
2.  Put cursor on a header line and type ^R (Rich Headers)
3.  Type the nickname of the distribution list into the "Lcc:" field
    (Whilst there, read the built-in help about the "Lcc:" field.)
4.  Continue with Subject and Message Text as usual.

Cheers,

Does anyone know if there is a ready to go package of Pine for
Solaris 2.5 x86 using Sun's C compiler that doesn't need hacking
to get it working?  Thanks for any input.  If not, is hacking the
gnu cc solaris build easier than the "build sol" or installing the gnu C
compiler?

Although all caps usually indicates an acronym, as near as I have been able
to tell in 12 years of working with UNIX is that this is an exception.  I
have frequently heard that it is a pun on Multics, a very overweight
computer operating system involving a number of companies in the late
1960's, at a time when time-sharing was generally unavailable.  AT&T was one
of the companies, although the lead company was GE, which later sold its
computer division to Honeywell (part of the "thundering HURD"?).  A handful
of computer scientists at AT&T wanted to keep the intimate time-sharing
environment they had developed for Multics, and finagled, filched and
whatever else was necessary to get a DEC PDP-7 to develop it on.  In a 1984
article in the AT&T Bell Labs Technical Journal special issue on The UNIX
System, Dennis Ritchie, one of those men, authoritatively states: "Brian
Kernighan suggested the name 'UNIX,' in a somewhat treacherous pun on
'Multics'...." (p. 1580).

The question is: how do you delete multiple items in pine?

The correct answer should be: Select(;) and Apply (A). Select allows you
to select all or some items. Apply allows you to delete, save, etc these
items.

I use PINE 3.95 and have these commands available from my Index. Check
yours and good luck!

[Sigh.  Mike goes to the cupboard and gets out his mind-reading
equipment.]

The first thing is to try and guess whether you are using the "main"
version of Pine on a UNIX system, or PC-Pine on an IBM PCompatible...

As you mention the program called "JPEGview" and I *happen* to know that
there is an image-viewing program of this name for the Apple Macintosh
I'll _assume_ you've got a Mac.  As this isn't a PCompatible you can't be
running PC-Pine.  Therefore you must be using a terminal emulator program
(probablt NCSA Telnet?) to connect and login to a UNIX computer, and using
Pine there.

Am I right so far?  If so...

You *probably* received the image as an "attachment" to a message you have
received.  Pine will say this if you did.  In which case read the message
(to get it on the screen).  Now use Pine's "V" command to see a list of
the attachments to the message.  Now select the image attachment using the
Arrow Keys and use the "S" command to save its contents to a file on disk.

NB.  This is your *UNIX* disk space; not the hard disk attached to your
Mac.  This is important for later.

Pine will ask you for a filename to store the attachment under.  It will
almost certainly suggest a name, which you can use if it doesn't clash
with one you already have.

OK...  you've now got the image stored on your UNIX disk space.

However the JPEGview is a program on the Macintosh.  It can only show you
images files stored on the Mac's own hard disk; the Mac doesn't know
anything about UNIS disk space, and so you can't yet use JPEGview to look
at the file (the Mac/JPEGview can't see it).

So your next step is to transfer a copy of the file from the UNIX disk
space down to your Mac's hard disk.  How you do this depends on the
software you have on your Mac, and the software available on your UNIX
system.

Mostly people use "ftp" to transfer files.  To use this you will need an
ftp "client" program on your Mac -- eg, "Fetch" or "Anarchie" -- and an
ftp "server" system set up (by your Systems Administrators) on your UNIX
system.  You will need to use Fetch/Anarchie to connect to your UNIXC
computer and pull across a copy of the image file.  *Make sure you
transfer this as a "binary" file.*  (If you transfer it as a "text" file
it will be garbled and unusable.)

If you can't use ftp then there may be some other file transfer program
you have to use -- eg, Kermit or XModem.

If you don't know how to operate any of these you should try reading their
documentation in the first instance.  Failing that ask for help locally at
your Help Desk.  If all else fails try a Macintosh newsgroup such as
comp.sys.mac.comm.

Once a copy of the file has been transferred down onto your Mac's hard
disk you can now use JPEGview to open it and look at it.

I hope it's worth it! ;-)

Message-ID: <slrn5hbca9.n0k.streiner@goofy.co.iup.edu>
Date: 27 Feb 97 11:05:02 EST

I'm presently in the process of replacing this system's MTA with qmail.
Qmail's built and installed - seems to be working properly.  However pine
will not peacefully coexist with qmail.  Other MUAs or front-ends on this
system work fine, however pine will exit with the following error when
attempting to send mail:

sendsig: can't grow stack, pid xxxxx, proc pine
Illegal instruction

This does _not_ affect incoming mail, which is working properly.  Also,
Pine worked flawlessly when I was running sendmail thru v8.8.5

System info:
OS: Ultrix v4.4 (MIPS)
Pine version: 3.95 (unpatched)
qmail version: 0.96
mailbox format: mbox

I didn't ramp up to maildir (qmail's preferred mailbox format) because
Pine doesn't yet support it.

Pine's config has been modified to support mbox by adding the following
line to pine.conf.fixed:

inbox-path=Mailbox

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance

How you extract the images depends on how the image was sent to you
(uuencoded or as a MIME attachment).  How can you tell the difference?
Easy.  Read the email which contains the image you want to view.  If there
is something in the Attachments line of the message header, something 
1) image/jpeg "image.jpg" (234K)

Then the image is in a MIME attachment.  To extract it, type V for View
Attachments, select the attachment (it will be highlighted) and type S to
save it to disk.  This will save it to your account.  Now you have to
download it from your account to your computer.  How you do this depends
on how you're connecting to your account.  Refer to your sysadmin for more
help - that's a little too broad to cover here.

If the image isn't in a MIME attachment, it's most likely uuencoded.  You
can tell for sure by looking at the message and somewhere near the
beginning of the message you see a line like
begin 640 filename.jpg
It's uuencoded.  The filename and permission numbers will probably be
different.  Type E to export the message to a file in your account.  Just
give it some garbage name as you'll be deleting it soon anyway.  If the
image is all in one part (not spread across several messages) you can just
type 'uudecode garbage_file'.  filename.jpg will then appear in your
account.  Download it the same way you would the image you pulled from a
MIME attachment.

I think it was MULTICS, an old time-sharing project from Bell, GE, and
CMI(?). UNIX was going to be more of a single-user version, but grew.

It's even worse (weirder) than that.  If you receive a message with a
multipart/alternative attachment, select "forward", delete the attachment,
and then send the message, your message goes out as a
multipart/alternative with the same boundaries as the original message. 
(This is true in 3.95). Hopefully the boundary marker is not in your
message text.  Everything *looks* ok, but the content-type really should
be text/plain (or whatever) instead of multipart/alternative.

Look for the following lines in your .pinerc file, and change the second 
line to the '99.9' I have shown below.

# Set by Pine; controls beginning-of-month sent-mail pruning.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
version 3.96.  This release is considered a maintenance release and is
intended to fix a small set of specific problems. 

These problems include all bugs fixed in the 3.95 patch released last
month as well as a security hole in both the imapd and ipopd daemons
distributed in the Pine 3.95 release.

If you are not running the IMAP or POP daemons distributed with a previous
release and you are not experiencing the problems addressed in the 3.95
patch, then upgrading to this latest release may not be necessary. 

The complete list of changes and improvements, as well as general
information about Pine, can be found via the built-in release notes
("R" off the Main Menu) and via: 

        http://www.cac.washington.edu/pine
and:
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs

This release should be considered more stable than its predecessors,
though you should be sure to verify for yourself that this is the case in
your specific environment before placing it into production use. 

Source for the latest Pine release is available in: 

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.gz

PC-Pine in available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine

and precompiled binaries for the various systems we have direct access to
are available in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin
and
        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/unix-bin-compressed

As always, Thanks and Enjoy! 

Sincerely,

The Pine Development Team

Is the ability to thread mail messages in Pine's future? This would be a
very nice feature :-)

Hi!


1)  Has anyone out there seen these lines before?

    [Checking "..." for recent messages <\> ]
    View next news group "..."? 
    [Opening "..." <\> ]
    [Sorting "..." |   xx%   |]

    Is there a way of skipping the question part? I would really
   like pine to enter all news groups that contain any new
   messages without having to type 'Y'! 


2)  Another thing that annoys me is how to sort messages...
    In my mailfolders (including my inbox) I'd like the messages
   sorted by 'Date' BUT when reading news I'd like them sorted by
   subject (and thereby being able to delete lot's of messages 
   that has no relevance for me)!
    Would it be possible to add a feature to the next version
   that allows users to select the sort order of single folders?
   Or possibly an standard sort order and than specifying the
   sort order of some folders?


 That's all for this time... Have a nice weekend folks!

Hi,

  I am using Pine 3.95 for Linux, and am using pine through ppp.
Is there a way to save the entire list of newsgroups, so that pine doesn't
download the entire list every time I need to subscribe to a new group or
send a post to a newsgroup?

Thank you, Ram

Yes, actually, there is. 

Go to Setup, Config, then find the 'customized-hdrs' entry.  Type A for 
Add, then type Bcc:<address>  where <address> is your other account's 
address.  It won't be blantantly obvious when you Compose a message 
unless you put the cursor in the header area and type Ctrl-R...then it'll 
show up.

Hi!

I have an account on a AIX system using AIX 3.2.5 on a IBM RS
6000-250.

It seems there is procmail installed (would you recommend filter
instead?) and I have already collected a couple of URLs to procmail
information.

Just one more question, what really would be the best is if I could
autoforward only mail coming from one e-mail address, do you know if
procmail can do this?

Many thanks Paul!

Eduardo

Very simple.  Spain once had many pine forests but so many sports
like bullfighting and soccer had many fatalities and so their
forests of pine dwindled to make caskets.  NO! I don't do Smileys!
But smile anyway as es una bromita nada mas.

    When working with non-US-ASCII character sets, there are usually
two aspects: displaying and entering.  For ISO-8859-x character sets,
you seem to have the display problem in hand.  As for _entering_
non-US-ASCII characters, I never did figure out how to do that with
Pine's built-in composer.  However, Pine allows you to specify another
editor to use when composing.  If you do that, then you enter (for
example) accented characters by whatever method that editor uses, which
will be different with every editor.  Depending on the editor, you may
not necessarily need any more terminal support.  For instance, I have
joe as my editor for Pine under a type of Un*x, and I can enter special
characters without any special support (other than display).

    Displaying Asian characters is not exclusively a Pine problem. 
Whatever terminal arrangement you have has to be able to display them.
