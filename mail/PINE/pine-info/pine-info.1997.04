Look at the message you sent yourself. Does it actually contain a
header which matches the above regular expression? No. That's what BCC
means: strip off the BCC header completely before sending the message.
(The mail transport doesn't even look at the headers; instead the
destination is known because the "envelope" contains it.)

If you want to combat BCC:s, one venue is to ditch everything which is
not specifically TO you. (Take care to process any mailing lists
first, they are usually BCC:ed or equivalent.)

This has nothing with Pine to do so I've trimmed comp.mail.pine from Followups.

I have a question that is not really pine related, but seeing that no one
here seems to be able to help me, I thought I'd try you. I use NCSA Telnet
on a Macintosh to log into a UNIX machine and view my mail using Pine. If
I print a message from Pine it somehow passes this print command through to 
the Mac, asking me: 

'Print message 15 using "attached-to-ansi"?'

Which, if confirmed causes the Mac print dialog box to appear. 

Now I would like to be able to do this directly from my unix prompt with 
my files as well instead of first ftp-ing my files to my Mac and then 
printing them. 
Could you tell me how Pine manages to do this?
I tried to look under Setup Printer, but couldn't figure out how it works.


		thanks,
			Cornelis.

You need a so called sending filter for that. Put something like this in
your ~/.pinerc:

# This defines a program that message text is piped into before MIME
# encoding, prior to sending
	sending-filters=~/bin/fortune

i.e. if you've decided to create a file in ~/bin that contains the following
line:
	fortune
	
and afterwards have chmod'ed it with a+x or whatever (thereby making it an
executable). Check the chmod man page to see which permissions you want to
give. However, I don't think that appending fortunes a good idea, because
some of them are rather lengthy and you'd end up with a 50 odd line
signature.

You could of course edit the original fortunes file and strip it of those
messages. BTW, to edit the fortunes-o files, you need rot-13 (Caesarian
rotation) as offered e.g. by Emacs >:->

Well, if you did not read the whole thing, you missed a very "Good Time".
It was one of the better parodies of the "newbie virus" that I have seen.
Of course, people who read email with MS's MUA's and who have Word on their
systems really *do* have to worry about reading the wrong email messages,
because of Word macro viruses.

Compile pine so that ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM is set and then set up
your From header in your customized headers.  I still think this
should be the default way that pine is compiled since 1) it is
common these days for people to have multiple addresses and to want
to be able to easily change the From line ON THE FLY while
composing a message and 2) it is not a way for people to forge
messages because the Sender and Received headers make it pretty
clear where the message really originated from.

Is there any chance that the pine developers would consider making 
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM the default? Please.  Also, does anyone know
where I can find a version of PC Pine for Windows 95 that has been
compiled with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM?  Note that I know how to fake
from headers with Pine (I'm doing it right now) but I want to be
able to change the From line on the fly.

Thanks,
Nancy

In the folder collections, upon opening the cursor always sits at the last
message in the folder, whereas it sits on the first unread message in the
regular incoming folders. Did I miss a setting or is this the wanted
behaviour?

TIA,

Subject: Pine not compiling on RedHat Alpha Box
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I'm running RedHat 4.0 with most of the 4.1 RPMS.  I have attempted to
install the src for pine and compile.  the build statement runs fine and
everything compiles to the point of it displaying the sizes of the
executables and it says that the pine and pico executables do not exist. 
For some reason they are not being compiled or built with the script.  I
have reinstalled the source several times and tried again and again.  There
is a makefile entry for linux - so i'm unsure of what the prob is. 
Attached is an example of where it dies.

How do I get pine to check mail on other pop servers?
I want it to check these places periodically, not just when I
log in.

Not at all. Pine is a mail reader, not an MTA. You will want to use one of
those for this task, preferably one that can be run in daemon mode. Fetchpop
is one of those:
	
	<http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~oh">

The  fetchpop  program  retrieves  mail from a remote host using the POP3
mail transfer protocol as described in RFC1225 and RFC1081.

Has anyone been using Pine 3.91 through 3.95 successfully with SCO
System V?  We are getting huge core dumps almost daily.  We use mostly
PC's running TinyTerm via TCP if that matters.

Will 3.96 solve the problem?  Does anyone have a binary for SCO SV of
3.96?

This may be one of those "why ask why?" questions, but why doesn't the U
of W support SCO?  Maybe because there aren't enough users to warrant
it...

I have seen situations long ago where ProComm simply blew chunks in its
vt100 emulation.  Try kermit.  It has much more reliable vtXXX emulation.

There have also been problems with some versions of joe overoptimizing
screen updates, leading to all sorts of anomalies.  In some versions of
joe, I have had to run his special termcap entries to get proper behavior.
I also remember from over two years ago when we moved all Suns to SunOS 5.4
or higher, that some versions of joe behaved differently depending on
whether they were compiled in the bsd universe (/bin/cc) or sysv universe
(/usr/5bin/cc).

I have found that pine 3.95 preserves some of its tty conditioning when it
hands the tty over to jove (my default implicit editor).  I do not remember
this in 3.91.

That is exactly the kind of behavior I have seen over 12 years with ProComm
(mis)emulations of the vt100 terminal.  You also may have some problems if
termcap is set to vt102 or 220 and the terminal emulator is only capable of
vt100.  Make sure both are set at the same level of emulation.  Another
thing I just thought of:  I have found the dt80 termcap/terminfo to work
better with some emulators than vt102.

Hi

I'm using ver 3.93 and I can't seem to get the select function to work
using the ";" as outlined in the help file.  

Any suggestions?  Could it be that way it is configured on my machine?

Thanks!

Jim

>From abc@foo.bar.baz Mon Jan 1 00:00:00 1990

Some headers, a body, and at least two blank lines before the next
"From ". Some files have blank lines at the beginning, this does not
seem to affect things.

It seems that the difference between the files is that pine thinks the
single message ones are read only, while the other ones are
not. "Arpa" shows just fine. "Prof", "mit" and others don't. What the
difference is between them, I can not divine. Prof has the same
permissions, correct "From " headers, etc.  but for some reason shows
up as a single message from the user, with a subject of the full path
of the mail folder. Similar results come from the other affected
files.

If anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate them.

Your best bet is to beat PINE at its alpahnumeric sorting and this can
be done without any software changes.

PINE give you the option to name folders and the secret to getting
your messages in a particular order is to determine what order you
want your newgroups in.

For example, I use comp.mail.pine, rec.arts.prose, and misc.writing
the most. I want misc.writing first, rec.art.prose, and comp.mail.
pine in that order.  I have named my folders:
	amiscwri
	brecpros
and     compmail

PINE sorts them alphabetically and I ignore the initial letter where
appropriate and proceed from there.  You have 26 categories just by
using a single letter alphabet and if you have something later that
you want to squeeze between amiscwri and brecpros just name that
folder  anjunk.  The double letter forces the sort routine to do the
re-ordering of your folders.  Works great in DOS too.

hello people

The only other question I can think of is in my address book, I want to
just make one huge list of all the other lists but I sure as hell don't
want to type it out, so I made another list with nickname "mlf", all the
other nicknames for the other lists were "ml1", "ml2", "ml3" etc... to
"ml8".  Anyways, under the address of "mlf" I put
"ml1,ml2,ml3,ml4,ml5,ml6,ml7,ml8" expecting the lists to unexpand but it
simply stays as "ml1,ml2,ml3,ml4..."  so this means I have to keep the
other lists but I would like to delete them if possible and just get one
list with all the addresses in it, is this possible?


better if you could reply me privatly, as i am not on this mailing list

Thank you

    I posted the article below recently on comp.editors.  I want to
emphasize that this problems occurs *ONLY* when my alternate editor is
invoked specifically by Pine, and under no other circumstances.  One
respondent speculated that Pine's screen control may not be well
debugged for alternate editors and may be causing Joe's screen control
to get a little flaky.  Anybody got any war stories or wisdom to share? 
Thanks.  --  Paul

Newsgroups: comp.editors
Subject: Joe / Pine Interface Problem

    Environment: SunOS 4.1.4, dialin to shell account (Cshell) from DOS
with ProComm Plus v2/DOS, VT100 emulation.  Editor: Joe 2.8.  Mail/
newsreader: Pine 3.96.  The problem arises whether I use my ISP's
compiled version of Joe, or whether I compile Joe myself.  The problem
only seems to arise when I use Joe as my alternate editor under Pine.

    When composing a message under Pine, Pine opens a file 
/tmp/pico.nnnnn, where nnnnn is some (temporarily) unique number. 
If there is quoted material, as in a reply or followup, Pine first
inserts the material, with the quoting string, into the /tmp/... file. 
It then passes control to the editor, which may be its own built-in
composer (ugh!) or a user-specified alternate editor (Joe 2.8 in my
case).

    However, when editing this file, visible characters have a way of
dropping off the display, to be replaced by blanks.  They have not
dropped out of the file: a screen refresh command will bring them right
back.  But it is annoying, to say the least.  The dropping of
characters seems to occur mostly when simply moving the cursor and when
deleting characters (one or more characters to the right of the cursor
position may get replaced by blanks).  Also, this phenomenon only seems
to occur when editing the temporary file set up by Pine, not when
editing a file when Joe is invoked from the command line.

    I admit I am a user, not a Un*x guru, so I don't really know where
to start looking.  Anyone have similar experiences or wisdom to share? 
Please also Cc: on any responses, as my newsfeed is rather flaky just
now, and I might miss a posted response.  Thanks very much.

    I do not entirely agree, Ed.  Your advice may be sound if one is
using Pine's rather wimpy built-in composer, but the problem may not
occur (or, at least, so severely) if one is using an alternate editor,
as permitted in the Pine configuration.

    For example, I use Joe 2.8 as my editor on a Un*x system.  (I
should specify that that latter fact is highly relevant.)  From time 
to time I experience a carrier drop when I am composing.  When the
connection breaks, Un*x sends a signal to my immediately active
process, Joe, which writes the workspace out to my current directory
under a reserved name.  Then Un*x cleans up and terminates the session. 
When I log back on, I can start the composition again and read in the
saved file, losing no more than a few keystrokes, and sometimes not
even that.  I presume that other, more sophisticated editors than the
Pine composer, could do the same thing under Un*x.  I haven't lost any
work yet, and I _do_ suffer carrier drops.

Greetings:

I am also a subscriber of IBM Global Network and, like yourself, tried to
use Pine to read/send mail and do news.  However, I was forced to abandon
my efforts in this direction for the time being because I discovered that
the the IBM pop-mail (pop01.ny.us.ibm.net) host does NOT support the IMAP
protocol.  

Now, maybe Amiga Pine, like its UNIX cousin, supports POP3 but PC Pine for
Windows 95 does not. :(

Good luck!

[snipped eloquent praise of joe]

*clapclap* I think Paul's remark is really touching a sore spot with pine.
Pico really isn't that great and joe isn't that much bigger. Is there any
reason for pico being distributed along with pine instead of joe? I don't
see any real disadvantages that joe might have. Besides, it can be run as
jpico... :-/

So, imvho, either pico needs some improvements (like better yanking,
foolproof autosave and a couple of other small things) or maybe joe might
just be a better alternative. And yes, I don't like vim, Sven >;->

Later,
Robin

You don't need Joe, etc to have your work be saved.  I use Pine 3.95
with the so-called 'wimpy' internal editor, and my work is not lost if
the connection is lost.  It is saved.  It seems like magic...  I think
it has to do more with how the system is setup than the particular
editor you are using.

Pine is designed to be simple, and Pico is simple.  I have talked with
Pine developers before about this, such as about an idea to add a new
feature to Pine/Pico, and they are really set on this point.  And I
agree with them.  I use Pine a lot, and I like it simple so I can type
very quickly and not worry about having too many commands.  And by
being simple, new users can get up to speed quickly.  The only thing I
miss in Pine/Pico is a search capability.

I wish I had more detail for you, unfortunately I'm running under Win 
95 right now, but I remember getting the same thing using joe 
to edit/create HTML files.  I don't know if it was ONLY HTML files, 
but that's mostly what I use it for.  At the time I was running Linux 
2.0.0 and older, now I run Linux 2.0.29 with whatever joe came with 
slackware-3.2.-beta and I haven't seen it since.

That's the intended behavior...
In Pine 4.x you'll have some choices for where the cursor lands when
opening incoming folders.

There certainly are not enough of them at UW!  Sorry...

(I do believe others have succeeded in getting recent Pines to work on
SCO, however. Perhaps one of them will offer the magic incantation.)

How are you accessing your inbox?  You should not see this message if you

however, for reasons not yet understood, it doesn't always succeed.

As a backup, recent versions of Pine will write a checkpoint file
every 250 keystrokes or so.  These will be in your home directory
with names like  #pico23005#

Hope this helps...

A user here was just saved retyping a long message by this.

This also means I was mistaken recently in saying Pine Composer does
not auto-save at all as Emacs does and that this is a Pine bug.

But so is jpico.

Ok, so much for that discussion then :-)

Have you ever tried yanking a message like yours with pico? When I started
using pine, I did, and 2 minutes later, I had an alternative editor set up.
Yanking with pico is a pain, and it would certainly not have got me "up to
speed" having had to yank your message manually --- quite the contrary :-/

As for "having too many commands", I have to disagree --- these are the
commands you get with jpico, and you could of course take away some for
beginners (hope this comes out ok...) :

I cannot see what's too complicated with that. But then again, I'm using

I am running a system that used sendmail with imapd, rimapd and pop3 for
mail access.

I have set up mail access to work remotely through pine using the 

	inbox={mailhost.dstc.uts.edu.au}inbox 

and have .rhosts set up to allow opening inbox without putting the
password in. 

The only thing is that it no longer works, and I was puzzled at why,
until I created a new user account, and initially the new user could log
in without typing in the password, but once netscape was used to
retrieve mail, pine will always ask for a password. This is regardless
of whether a .rhosts exists or not.

I can't be sure if this is the reason, but it seems as though it is. 
I've checked out dot files in my home directory to see if anything could
be causing problems, but all seems fine...

Has anyone else seen this problem before??? or does anyone have any
ideas...???

When viewing a message, press 'w', to search for a word. When composing a
message, (in the highly exalted pico editor), press '^W', for the same
command.

Unix Pine does not have the "mbox" driver compiled in by default, but
the latest IMAP4rev1 servers do.  However, the mbox driver should not
move any mail unless the mbox file already exists, and is in a valid
format.  The quick fix would be to rename the mbox file and copy the
messages back to INBOX.  To make sure this doesn't happen again, check
to see that Unix Pine and your IMAP server are compiled with the same
set of drivers.  If you compile both out of the same Pine
distribution, that is done automatically.

Hope that helps!

!NO GRITE POR FAVOR!

Your picture is probably uuencoded so that it can be included as text in
the body of the message. 

Try saving it to a file and enter the command "uudecode [filename]".  You
need not delete any header info and test before the "start" instruction -
uudecode is smart enough to find the part it has to work on.

If you are reading mail stored on your computer and not on a Unix server,
you can find freely distributable uuencode and uudecode programs for
almost any platform.

	Hello...
  
	We are users of pine since version 3.9, we usually print our menssages

	Now we change our computers with W95, the users want still access pine in

problems
	to print with option "attchm-to-ansi", simple, no print.

	Now a days we use pine 3.94 for UNIX of HP-UX 9.05.

	Could you tell us, how to resolv this problem ? 
	We really need help

	Any help would be appreciated it.

Your config says you're printing "attached-to-ansi".

Here's a snippet from the faq:

  Why doesn't "attached-to-ansi" printing work?

   So-called "attached-to-ansi" printing relies on the communication
   software you are using to interpret certain special characater
   sequences that tell it to divert the incoming stream of characters to
   your printer, and then back to your screen. Perhaps 99% of "pine
   printing problems" are either due to PC or Mac communications software
   that doesn't understand ANSI escape sequences for printing, or (in the
   dialin case) softare flow- control problems.
[...]

 1. Check For Software Flow-Control Problems
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters" (requires 3.91 or
       later)
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty is
       needed. (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS
       will not be needed in 3.92 or later).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.

 2. Check Your Comm Software For Ansi Printing Capability
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still doesn't
       work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault. I don't
       know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error and
       word-of-mouth.
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also be
       used for testing. It simply sends the specified text file to user's
       terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences for print
       diversion. This is just what Pine does as well (although some
       versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)

 3. Possible Other Printing Problems
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer. Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text into
       postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using enscript
       and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example, whether
       or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the last page,
       or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc. Many of these
       problem will also require using the custom print command option and
       "ansiprt".


Hope that helps and stuff...

Later,
Robin

Here's something from the "secrets" for a change:

     * Experience has shown that printing difficulties using Pine's
       "Attached-to-ANSI" feature are almost always due to problems with the
       PC or Mac communication programs being used (not all of them
       implement the ANSI standard control sequences for printing), or the
       printer configuration on the PC or Mac; however, there are cases
       where Pine's printing assumptions don't match what your printer
       requires (e.g. specific End-of-line convention, or suppression of the
       trailing form-feed to eject the last page, or needing PostScript). In
       these cases, setting a custom print command may be appropriate,
       perhaps using the "ansiprt" Unix command included in the Pine
       distribution and the commonly available "enscript" postscript encoder
       command.

Make sure to check the FAQ for further information... This document, as well
as other valuable information on pine can be obtained from *yawn*:

Much as I enjoy using Pine as my regular mail program (albeit with
enable-alternate-editor-implicitly set to vim), I would prefer that it
stick to the standard UNIX conventions (like ctrl-U to erase the current
line rather than ctrl-K; using '/' to search rather than ctrl-W).

Otherwise, yes, it is actually a model program in how it manages to achieve
an acceptible compromise between simplicity and usability (and it is _very_
usable, when combined with a decent editor and procmail).

    There is another point being overlooked here.  Bcc: was not
conjured up a long time ago merely to make life easier for spammers. 
It has a real, real-world, and specific purpose to aid privacy.  I have
sent mail with Bcc: for just that purpose, and I have been a Bcc:
recipient for just that purpose.  Trying to discard *every* piece of
mail that comes via Bcc: could mean that you discard some important
personal mail.

Hello, 

Can anyone tell me if there is a way to block mails from coming from a 
certain address. For instance, if I don't want to get any emails from
the address abc@def.ghi.edu, the mails will be bounced back to "abc" 
whenever "abc" sends me emails.

Thanks in advance.

Anand

- From "FAQ.where":

     Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of other
     programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent."
     For details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
     Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
     locations:

	http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/

Bouncing is nice but not very useful. Either send those mails to /dev/null
or create a kill-file that does something else with them. Remember to test
this file *thoroughly* before using it *blush*. With procmail, the following
should do:

:0:
* ^From.*rcummins
/dev/null

to filter all mail from a certain loser whose email address contains the
appropriate characters.

Otherwise, check the procmail man pages and mailing list (which is
*really* good). 

Later,
Robin

Subject: Diacritics on Pine
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I have occasion to compose messages in French, Spanish, and German using Pine (I'm using version
3.9.something; I forget the exact version number). On my computer using Windows 95 at work I
have no problem supplying the various unlauts, circumflexes, etc. using the Windows convention
of ALT + numeric pad key. 

At home I use a Macintosh. When I'm in Pine, the Mac convention of adding diacritics by pressing
the Option with another key doesn't work.

Can anyone tell me if there is some way of adding diacritics in Pine on a Mac?

When April began, pine 3.96 asked me to move current "sentmail" to
"sent-mail-mar-1997" for about 24 hours!

Can I configure pine to ask this once? where?

Subject: pc pine, Unix Pine IMAP server and inboxes
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I am having a problem with inboxes that Pine uses. I have my mail on an
unix system. I have been using Pine for a couple of years, currently using
version 3.95 on unix. Yesterday I tried pc pine for the first time and
configured it to read my unix mail. Once Pc Pine had read the inbox, then
the Unix version of Pine no longer had any messages in its inbox. (I
originally had 5 read message in my pine inbox.)

Here is my setting for Pine on UNix:
personal-name            = Sandra J. Wald
user-domain              = <No Value Set>
smtp-server              = <No Value Set>
nntp-server              = news.doit.wisc.edu
inbox-path               = <No Value Set: using "inbox">
folder-collections       = mail/[]
news-collections         = <Empty Value> 
incoming-archive-folders = <No Value Set>
pruned-folders           = <No Value Set>
default-fcc              = <No Value Set: using "sent-mail">   
default-saved-msg-folder = <No Value Set: using "saved-messages">

default-fcc              = <No Value Set: using "sent-mail">
default-saved-msg-folder = <No Value Set: using "saved-messages">
postponed-folder         = <No Value Set: using "postponed-msgs">
read-message-folder      = <No Value Set>
signature-file           = <No Value Set: using ".signature">
global-address-book      = <No Value Set>
address-book             = <No Value Set: using ".addressbook">
feature-list             =


I am using default value for inbox on Unix Pine. But I no longer have 5
messages that appear in box. We have determined that once IMAP server is
used (i.e. when using pc pine to read Unix mail) the mail from the system
inbox appears to be moved to mbox on unix. Pc Pine, and IMAP check seem to
check both locations for inbox mail. If I configure Unix Pine as follows:
inbox-path               = {ssc.wisc.edu}inbox

ssc.wisc.edu is generic name for our mail server called duncan, and it
also houses an Imap server.

ssc.wisc.edu is generic name for our mail server called duncan, and it
also houses an Imap server.

When Unix Pine is started using this config then I get the following,
where I must login into the mail server called duncan:
   Copyright 1989-1996.  PINE is a trademark of the University of
Washington.
HOST: duncan.ssc.wisc.edu  ENTER LOGIN NAME: swald
^G Help
^C Cancel   Ret Accept

After I log in then I will see my 5 mail messages in the inbox.

So it seems IMAP Server checks both locations.

*******  the question *************


1. Is there some way to configure the IMAP server so it leaves mail in the
System INBOX and does not move inbox mail once retrieved to unix mbox?

We notice that Netscape also seems to have a problem retrieving inbox mail
once the mail has gone thru imap server.


thank you,
Sandra

Some mail application readers support the "Proposed Standard for Message
Encapsulation", aka RFC-934.  The digest is put together using a dash
(decimal code 45, "-") which acts as an encapsulation boundary.  Some
newgroups are also formatted this way when mailed.

Is it likely that pine will support a digest and bursting option for
forwarding messages containing several encapsulations in addition
to multiple attachments that it currently does?

I have a user who has a number of folders that, for some unknown reason,
Pine thinks should be read-only.

I have tried twiddling with the "From " headers, restarting the NFS
daemons on the machine that serves the files (including the lockd) and
even tried copying the file and looking at that copy. None of these
remedies changed anything. The file shows up as one big message that is
read only.

Any Ideas?

Not *positive* but 3.96 seems to have fixed that little prob....I tried
for two afternoons with my smail config and my pine configs to make my
name appear instead of the email address I had send the message to....now
it magically works fine...prolly just the upgrade to 3.96 that did it
though. ymmv

	Here's a kludge that ought to work (but that I
haven't tried): import the file into the text of a
message to yourself; send it; when it arrives, use T
(ake address) on it, and go from there.

You are correct. This ought to work and it is a bug that it doesn't. It
will be fixed in next version of Pine. We'll also try to take a
look at the documentation. Thanks!

I checked the Faq but didn't see an answer.

Is there a way to exit PINE without it saving changes
such as which messages were read and leaving the inbox
intact before the PINE access?

I don't know whether or not this helps you find the problem, but this
error message only happens if the *source* mailbox is in Berkeley format.

Subject: changing "from" address
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

   I am using Pine 3.91. I have posted to news.admin.net-abuse.usenet/email
and not gotten an answer. I want to know how to change my "from" address to
include "nospam" or similar (when posting publically. i.e. usenet). I looked
online, and could find many a reference TO it, but not how to DO it.
   I have a NEW ISP from tomorrow, and DON'T want my new address to be
attacked by spam like THIS address has been recently (following usenet
postings). 

  Thanks.

Good idea for a small list, maybe not so good for a long one...

Check the format of the file containing the addresses. If it isn't ascii,
convert it. Then check the format of the file ~/.addressbook. See if the two
formats somehow match. Then throw up your hands in dispair and get someone
who knows a little perl. It shouldn't be a problem to convert it. You
probably don't want to use pine for running a mailing list, though :-)

Later,
Robin

Well, what your mail is lacking in style and design (no all caps, not enough
exclamation marks, not enough typoes...), it makes good for in content.

Dear GUMP3038@aol.com, here's what you need to do:

1. Get a copy of the netiquette, the email faq or some common-sense advice
   from your mama. You don't want to mail bomb people. You *really* don't.
2. *Never* mess with people who could turn your sorry little account out
   with the flick of a wrist. If you don't know what a postmaster is, you'll
   probably learn RSN.
3. Get a life. Or better: Get a mouse chord and hang yourself.

That depends... If it's the usual cheerful brick through your living room

Otherwise, go to the S(etup), C(onfig) screen and set the character set like
this:

Hi, I am using Pine on Linux.  How do I configure pine and use it with
my POP3 server?  I use a dial-in access to my ISP for internet access. 
How do I log on to my POP3 server?  I can send mail right now, but I
cannot receive mail.

However, I still have one problem in sending mail.  My email address is
jlau@clo.com

But when I send mail, my email address becomes root@clo.com
Must have create a separate account with the username jlau in order for
my email address to appear correctly?

Thanks in advnace.  Please reply via mail.

You only get the point if you've read the Good Times Virus alerts. Anybody who
reads this newsgroup with any amount of regularity, (that would require a
termninal in the reading room, right? I'll have to get on that), would know
that Robin knows enough to not have been sending that seriously. Now, even if
someone didn't know that, if they read the message carefully, they'd see
enough clues to indicate that this was not just any hoax, but a hoaxed hoax.

So what does the Socha virus do, btw???

Is there a way to take a file of e-maill addresses,
and create a maillist, or in some other way to send
e-mail to each person in that file? I'm only talking
< 120 folks, but I sure don't want to type each one
in separately.

Thanks for any help...

Oh yes, indeed they do! Mcafee have now found a word macro virus that
will startup microsoft mail and mail itself as an attachment to three
random people in your address book ...

The receiver still has to read the attachment manually though.

The virus message has the subject "You have GOT to read this!"

The virus/worm is called 'ShareTheFun' ...

Since we upgraded sendmail from 8.7.1 to 8.8.5, userdb.db didn't
seem to work anymore (i.e. the outgoing addresses didn't get rewrite).
Worse, whenever we tried to evoke pine (3.9.6), it always
shows 'incomplete maildomain xxx.' followed by 'Return address
you send my be incorrect'.  I added to add FQDN (although it
was unnecessary) but it still gave me the same error.
We are using Solaris 2.5.1.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Oops! No wonder I couldn't find any naked lady binaries to decode!

Seriously, I find lurking a very educational hobby. If I'm going to be
talking to Unix boxes, I'm not afraid to try to learn when and where I
can.

Thanks for the education.

Sometimes when I am responding to a message I choose to include some of the
text of the message. When I attempt to send it I get error messages which
include a number. I end up abandoning and starting from scratch. How can
I find out what these errors mean and how to correct them?

Thanks,

It turns you into a really KeWL guy with a profound knowledge of nothing
special, a revolting sense of humour, a large set of random flames just a
keystroke away and a throng of fervent adorers like that certain loser
somewhere at the other end of intelligence.

Get it while you can!

Be warned though, there is a lame copy out there that infects *.com and
*.exe files. But who's using Windos, anyway? What's a virus? Bill WHO?

Thousands of Beta testers for Windos 00 or whatever the name was have found
a macro virus that will startup microsoft mail and mail a list of all files
on their system to Gates, along with some private stuff. So what? You ask
for it, you get it... Besides, that virus is at least 6 months old *yawn*
and a lame one, too... I like the one that fdisks your hdds without prior
notice. I think it's called NT 4.0 or something.

You read with your hands? Interesting idea, but since it's Word...
everything is possible... Where do you want to grab today?

  >The virus message has the subject "You have GOT to read this!"

Naah, the virus message has the subject "made for Windows 3.x or better". It
doesn't say "You have GOT to trash this!", though. Gates ought to be sued
for criminal negligence...

  >The virus/worm is called 'ShareTheFun' ...

It's called "ShareWare" and comes on handcrafted CDs with 650MB zipped
"commericial" software that doesn't have any copy protection to speak of.

Serious threat: Either you guys stop this thread, or at least have the
decency to take my name off the subject line. TIA. :)

Two things for you to do:

1) Take a look at the format of .addressbook. Make your file match this
format. Since it's a fixed set of addresses, you might only need the entry
for the actual address, so that's a couple of lines in perl or something.

2) Take a look at the manual for information on distribution lists and
alternate address books. You'll like it :-)

Subject: Future POP access?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello.  I used Pine for a long time when I had a shell account with
another provider.  I have since then switched providers, but the one
I'm currently with only allows PPP access w/o shell access. :-(  This
question goes out to the authors of Pine, in which: will there ever be
a version of PC-Pine dedicated to offline e-mail and POP?  Although
I've read  IMAP is obviously superior in POP in most ways, it's nice
to still use PC-Pine when that factor has been taken out.

Thanks,
-Eugene

Yes, you can.

Try having a look at Pine's Setup Configuration screen; in particular at
the "signature-at-bottom" option there.

Well, it's what it says: There's a lock on your inbox folder. That means
that you probably have two sessions open. Close one and the problem should
go away. Someone suggested a work-around, but I forget what it was...

Later,

Pine's default behavior encourages a user to put his or her contribution
before the inclusion of the original text of the message being forwarded or
replied to, This is contrary to some conventions, but makes the conversation
more readable when a long original message is included in a reply for
context. The reader doesn't have to scroll through the original text that he
or she has probably already seen to find the new text. If the reader wishes
to see the old message(s), the reader can scroll further into the message.
Users who prefer to add their input at the end of a message should set the
signature-at-bottom feature in the feature-list. The signature will then be
appended to the end of the message after any included text. This feature
applies when replying, not when forwarding.

So is it an email virus or a word virus ? Any virus can be sent as an
attachment. You need a mailer that auto explodes/executes them to
cause a problem. The fact that is makes specific use of your mailer to
then resend itself may make the difference. So it a MS Mail virus ?

1. This is the pine discussion forum, not the Mickysoft loser list.
2. Even if it were an email virus, it would only affect people whose names
   are in MS-mail address books -- which is fine with me.
3. With Word Basic's capability of writing into the keyboard buffer, you can
   do almost anything. Why make a fuss about this? It's a Word Macro Virus
   that launches MS Mail. Nothing new about it, is there?

So will you twits stop using my name to discuss this bullcrap? There's Mime
Sweeper and a couple of other programs that care of these "viruses". After
all, they're just some Word Macros. If you don't find a way to disable the
autostart function for those macros, I'd say it's your own fault if you
nevertheless read mail from the net..

And: Who should send you these documents? Apart from the fact that I'm using
StarWriter for Linux (visit http://www.stardiv.de for a full office suite
for Linux for *free*) to open Word documents (what's a virus, anyway?), who
should send me that "infected" documents? If you read a document that isn't
pgp-signed; if you're reading stuff from a.s.s.; if you exchange Word
documents with people whose system you're not running yourself; if you
blablabla... In short: It's all your fault. In "times like these" with
millions of aol users on the loose, it's up to you to protect your system.
Using an operating system instead of Windos seems a good first step to me.

Could this thread be buried now, *prettyplease* ?

Sandra,
If messages disappear from your INBOX after running PC-Pine, look
closely at your *pc-pine* configuration... in particular, see if
there is a "read-message-folder" set.

Thanks for the tip...
I tried the above and it did not work, anyone else ?

I need this feature to avoid typing 116 addresses not
to spam anyone. You can check several newsgroups and 
see I am anti-spam.

The kludge really should have worked. Which version of pine are you using?
Would you mind trying the kludge but mailing it to me instead of you so I
can figure out why it didn't work? Thanks.

Email is not private unless it's encrypted somehow (i.e. PGP).  Anybody with a packet sniffer can read any mail being sent to you..

Well, it only took about 10 seconds. Dennis sent me the file in mail, I
did Take, Listmode, A(setAll), Take and I have a list in my addressbook. I
mailed him the lines to append to his addressbook.

But actually I was even more interested in checking to see if there was a
bug that should be fixed before the next pine.

1)  When you write to any newsgroup, please try to choose a descriptive
    title in the Subject: field of your messages.

2)  When you write in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, it is considered that you
    are shouting loudly and noisily at people.

3)  We cannot help you with your question until you provide more
    information.  The image file you received could be in any of
    several formats which could produce something like you see, so
    no one can help you without knowing what the format is.  Please
    write again and include perhaps the first six lines of the file 
    so we can see it.  Also please include information about what 
    computer operating system you are using.

Subject: Jumping to First New Message on Open - How?
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a very simple question for you.

We're running Pine 3.91 under SunOS.  When one of our users opens his
INBOX, he is placed at message #1 instead of the last message or the first
new message in the INBOX.  This only happens to one user.  All other users
are placed at the end of the INBOX or the first new message.  

Can you tell me how get Pine to jump to the first new message when the
INBOX is opened?

Dennis, one other thought: if you start creating very
many long distribution lists, you can fill up your
.addressbook. (I think you can anyway.) 
	I often get warning messages, and sometimes
worse, when I add addresses, even when my space quota on
the pine machine is well below limit.
	There is a way to edit the .addressbook, which I
think I can still find, better than just going through
it and hitting d on individual entries.
	Another kludge, that I've set up but not tried
yet: when you take an address that you know you won't
want long, write "delete" in the comment field. Then
occasionally go into the addressbook, keep telling it w,
and delete each the slow way.
	If one of you others knows something better, I'd
like to have it.

This is easy, in my favorite editor, takes about 30 seconds.

Take your list of addresses, one to a line:

Tom Jones <tom@king.dom.com>
Bill Smith <bill@micro.soft.com>
....

Append a comma to the end of each line, insert 3 spaces at the start of each
line. Replace the comma at the end of the last line with a ")".
Replace the 3 spaces at the start of the first line with:
      "thelist<TAB>thelist<TAB>("

The "<TAB>" means hit the tab key.

The add the file in the pine config as an extra address-book and put 'thelist'
on the 'BCC:' line of the message header.

PS: My favorite editor is vi ... cue an emacs fan ... :-)

_hopefully_ even soft aren't thick enough to make any software that allows
a true email virus, tho based on activeX I wouldn't make a bet.

Yes, Yes, we know 'doze == crap, but most suits have an unholy horror of the

Why not ? Of course it doesn't help that you've broken it.

Thank you for your prompt reply.  I suppose it is like a postcard
only you don't have to wait two weeks to receive it.  Am I correct
in assuming that?  Thanks!

Who needs a packet sniffer, on many systems the email spool directories
are global read (Though they shouldn't be) and root can always read any
mail.

The normal analogy is the email is about as private as a postcard.
Encryption (eg PGP) can quite reasonably considered like an envelope.

	I just realized I forgot to tell him about the
things he has to have enabled in setup-config to do
selection; and he may not have known that. (I'd have to
go find them again; you must know off the top of your
head.)

	Here's hoping we may (with some vestige of

Maybe a word about encryption might be appreciated:

   "PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a public key encryption package to protect
   E-mail and data files. It lets you communicate securely with people
   you've never met, with no secure channels needed for prior exchange of
   keys."
   
You can get PGP from the internet for almost any platform. It's easy to
install and can be used to secure the files on your system, too. 

There are a couple of filters available to use PGP with pine, most notably
pgp-pine by Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de>

	http://www.rhein.de/~roland/

and papp by Aldo Valente <aldo@rhein.de>

	http://www.rhein.de/~aldo/

The latter gives you the opportunity to store the passphrase for either the
session or (*not* good) in a file for general use.

So, if you think you need to exchange sensitive data, if you want to make
sure your message isn't garbled with, or if you want to make a political
statement for free speech on the internet, go for PGP.
        
Nice weekend and stuff,
Robin

    Yes.  It wasn't clear to me whether you are doing the sending 
to other people or whether somebody is sending to a lot of people
including you.  In either case, assuming the sender is using Pine:

1)  If the version of the sending Pine involved is recent enough (I 
    do not remember the cutoff version number), put the distribution 
    list name in the Lcc: field instead of the To: field;

2)  If the version of Pine is not recent enough, put the distribution
    list name in the Bcc: field; put _something_ in the To: field,
    such as the sender's own email address (do not leave it blank).

Try editing your .pinerc again adding a line like this:

 user-domain=bellsouth.net

And while you're at it, you probably want to set user-id, e.g.:

 user-id=jiminmem

Do a search through the file and make sure that each of these are
set only once.  Also make sure that this info is not being
overridden by a customized-hdrs setting, e.g.:

 customized-hdrs=From: Jim Love <bogus@bogosity.com>

Also, make sure that you do all your edits to your .pinerc while
pine is NOT running.

Good luck,
Nancy

When I started with Pine on CNC last August, I had Pine v 3.91 - went to
3.93, 3.95, now at 3.96. I *still* have the same problem mentioned by the
original poster. Nothing I've tried seems to help, and just moving to 3.96
surely didn't have an effect either way. Sounds like a good suggestion for
the wish list :-)

Nancy,

Thank you for your prompt, courteous, informative reply. I appreciate
you taking the time to respond. As per your comments regarding spammers,
I am well aware of their tactics. At this point in time, I prefer to
treat them the same way I treat all of my U.S. mail. If someone wishes
to communicate with me to discuss something, I like to make it as easy
as possible for them to contact me and I will be glad to share
knowledge. If it's junk, I throw it in the garbage like I do the US mail
junk. No big deal. I don't want to sound like it's some kind of macho
thing, (all 130 lbs. of me!) but I refuse to run and hide. I want to
make it easy for my friends to communicate with me, I ignore small
infractions on my privacy, and I think we all are learning the proper
ways (and the not so proper ways) to shut down true spammers.

Thanks again,
Sincerely
-- 
Jim Love

	I believe the standard plain-English answer is
that an email is a postcard -- if not, like your post
and all the others here including this one, a piece of
paper on a bulletin board. Never write anything in such
a place that you have *any* doubt about.
	There are horror stories, but they're pretty
much off-topic here, I think. Ask your guru.

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Yes, I need to know too! I receive a lot of mail with attached
photographs. The
text of the mail has descriptions of the photographs which I want to
save in a
mail folder. After I have saved the attachment in a file with Pine, I
don't need
the encoded attachment on the message, it just eats up valuable disk
space. Is
it possible to remove attachments from email with Pine like some other
email
programs do?

Thanks,

Hello,

  I have been trying to read news with pine. I have set the
nntp-server variable in my .pinerc. For example,

nntp-server=news.nowhere.com

  But when I try to open one of the news folders of a group I
have subscribed to I get the error message

"480 Authentication required for command"

  I have a user name and password for the host serving me news, but
I can't figure out how to tell pine what they are. I have successfully
done this with another news reader (slrn) by putting this information
in its configuration file.

  I hope someone can tell me how I can tell pine what are the user name
and password to use when contacting my mail server.

Thanks,

David

- From the FAQ:

  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
    
  In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers area,
  press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive help
  screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.

RIF.

Oh, well... Try v(iew), s(ave) and (you seem to be on a u*ix system), type:

Good luck for your summer project and regards to Saurav :-)

Btw, if your friend decided on naming his files a little more aptly (e.g.
.txt), you might have less of a problem.

Later,

The easiest way is to not use Save; use Export instead.  It'll ask you=20
for a filename to save it under, then will save the text and a brief=20
message telling you that it couldn't read the attachment so it wasn't=20
saved. =20

I don't know what's at the bottom of your screen, but mine says:

^G Get Help ^R Rich Hdr  

So, type ^R to get the "rich header" view and then ^G to get to the
context-sensitive help.

But... Maybe you should take a close look at the faq and the other docu on
pine first. They'll help you a lot to find quick solutions to similarly easy
problems, ok? :-)

Later,
Robin

I hope this is not a FAQ. Many MUAs including Mozilla and ELM
automatically add 'sigdashes' (---) to the ~/.signature file.
Pine doesn't seem to support this. as a consequence, I have to
maintain a separate .signature file just for Pine which has the
sigdashes included. Is there probably a hidden switch in the
.pinerc which I just haven't noticed so far?

Nope:
	-<option>=<value>      Assign <value> to the pinerc option <option>
              	               e.g. -signature-file=sig1   #command line
or:

	signature-file           = .sig1 		   #.pinerc
	
will do the trick. Just cp your old .signature and add some dashes.

Thanks a bunch for revealing the secret of the mysterious sigdashes, btw :-)
I've always wondered where those came from. *Really* sensible feature, I
must say :-/

When I spell checking a message that I have replied to with ispell, it

Hi!

When asking a question it usually helps to give as much information as
possibly about the platform you are using Pine on (in particular whether
it is PC-Pine or the UNIX version), and which version it is that you are
using.

You didn't mention either of these, but from the message-id your Pine
generated when you sent your message...1

    Message-Id: <Pine.HPP.3.92.970406175614.6561A-100000@hpoprf.cern.ch>

...I deduce it's the version 3.92 for Unix (some sort of HP system?).

Support for using news servers requiring authentication was introduced in
Pine 3.93.  So the solution to your problem is to upgrade to the current
version of Pine (3.96).  This will automatically prompt you to enter the
username and password for your news server when it is needed.

Cheers,

--

Looks pretty good from my end.

 Hola Bill:
    Muchas gracias por contestarme, pero sigo teniendo el problema, porque
cuando escribo el "uudecode [filename]" me dice que "no match", y no se
con que se supone que tiene que coincidir, si me lo explicas otra vez,
hazlo como si fuese para un ni=F1o de tres a=F1os, muchas gracias por tu
paciencia, y si te sirve de algo para poder explicarmelo mejor, estoy en
el ordenador de la facultad.
    Espero respuesta lo mas pronto que puedas, y perdona que te tutee pero
es que es la costumbre.=20
                                           E.C.F.
P.D:Si te aburres mucho, tambien me podrias explicar como se mandan,
gracias.

Hi,
Is it possible to delete a few messages one at a time, for example, delete
messages from #1 - 20. (instead of pressing "d" in each message to
delete it).

Thank's,
Stephen

I am very commonly mail bombed by my friends, I often wonder how they send me
mail bombs.  I was wondering if you could tell me how one sends a mail bomb.
 I would really appreciate it, if not that's okay, i guess.

Subject: Security hole in imapd - pine 3.96 affected?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi, I just got the CERT advisory for a security hole in imapd which, when
exploited, can be used to execute arbitrary root commands.  They mention
that all versions of U of W IMAPD prior to 10 something are affected.
They then go on to say that if you're not ready to upgrade to IMAP 4rev1,
you can "download a corrected imapd as part of pine 3.96".  Pine 3.96
definantly uses a U of W imapd less than V10 (far less).  Has 3.96 just
been fixed (why isn't it 3.97?), or has 3.96 been fine all along?

Does anyone know if any earlier versions of pine imapd were effected?
We've been using 3.96 since it came out, but It would be make me feel good
if I know that no pine imapd has had that bug.

I've gone over the source code a bit, and know bufer overflow
possibilities are obvious before the setuid - but I didn't look very long
(and I'm no expert).  I just need to know how to treat this from a
security perspective - either possible root compramise (have to be
pesimistic) or not possible.  I don't want to spend the hours doing a
complete security sweep unless I'm sure there was a chance for a problem.

I'd also like to re-enable my imap server ASAP.  It would be helpfull if
someone could tell me (preferable in private e-mail for security reasons)
the exact location in imapd where the buffer overrun was possible.  I was
in the process of installing IMAPDd 4 (probably one of the bad ones), but
didn't finish.

Thanks a lot, 
	Rick

I'm using Pine 3.91.  I access it with the telnet program that comes with 
Win5.  I've noticed that when reading a message, the percentage number in 
the top right corner doesn't change when I go to the next page of the 
message.  Also, the ctrl-^ doesn't work. What gives?

Yep, use the ';'-Select command, and then the 'A'-Apply command.
Aggregate commands must be enabled (see your feature lists in your
configuration) for this to work...

I would suggest you contact your (friends) provider.  I had a number of
kids continuously send each other mailbombs, just as a joke.  The problem
was, that it would send them concurrently, causing hundreads of smail
daemons to be executed at once (they would usually send thousands of
message at a time).  If they let it go long enough (not too long) the
system would eventually run out of open file descriptors and come to a
grinding halt.  I'm only part time - so I just got messages from staff
telling me that canal crashed - and it was to late for me to be able to
tell what caused.  After about a week of this, it started to happen once
when I was in, and I tracked it down to a tonne of smail processes
running.

I quickly fixed it up (removing thousands of queued messages), and
cancelled those users account.  They insist they didn't know, I say too
bad.  They're just lucky we didn't decide to sue them - it was clearly an
abuse of the system.  Many of our other users were angry about the
reboots.  I know one of this kids Father (who owned the account) was very
upset at the kid, I suspect he'll be grounded for a long time....

P.S. You might want to relay this message to your friends before they have
a phone call from a not-as-friendly-as-I system administrator.

I'm continually amazed at the things the kids here do and then
claim they didn't know what the consequences of their actions
would be.  One kid, once, sent not one but *eight* WALL commands
to the system (the Unix geeks on the list will get that one)
before we disabled wall and suspended his account.  Said he 'just
wanted to see what it would do'.  Eight iterations of the command
later we were swamped with complaints, and he apparently still
didn't quite get what it would do.
Two students, who work for us at the helpdesk part time, and who
both know better, mailbombed each other on the Computing Sciences
server here and lost their accounts for a month for their
troubles.  Severely affected their studies and their ability to
do their assignments, but got the point across that stupidity
like that is a blatant waste of much-needed resources and won't
be put up with.
Put bluntly, what your friends are doing is immature, stupid,
wasteful, and potentially harmful to themselves and others.  
Don't follow suit;  you'll only make yourself look as juvenile as
they do.

Let's face it: That kid's from aol. I tried to contact postmaster@aol.com
because of some other twits who wanted to send mailbombs... *rotfl*
demanding that their accounts be closed. I even used my official account
with the Govt. for it. Didn't work.

Being a regular reader of this list, I'd like to suggest permanently
filtering @aol, @compuserve and @t-online.de from the mailing list. Any
objections? >:->

TIA

Later,
Robin

Contrary to popular belief, Unix is user friendly.
It just happens to be selective about who it makes friends with.

Sounds good... Too bad we can't get filters like that installed on every

Concerning the comments made by an awful lot of you about the mail bomb thingie, 
I've been mail-bombed on PINE before and there was nothing I could do about it. 
In the space of ten minutes, about 200 mails came through. That wasn't a lot, 
but when I collected them off of a different e-mailing program it took me over 
by just enough time to clean out my small bank account. But I do have a couple 
questions here:

How can I "block" someone's message, as in just not take it?

Is there a way to "refuse" certain parties mail? 

Can I set PINE up to ignore certain e-mail addresses entirely?

And a non-mail-bomb question, can I save mail from PINE onto a floppy disk?

Thank's for the information.
But still I have to select every message right.  If I have 100 messages
that I want to delete, I still have to select them one by one & apply the 
delete.
Is there any command to delete it with specifying the number of the
message (for example, I will be able to  delete my 100 messages say only
by typing "delete 1-100")? 

Thank's again,
Stephen

I've noticed that when using pine/UNIX to post messages compared
with mail/Mail, the time it takes to send it out and
finally get OK is 10-100 times longer than when using BSD
mail or SysV mail. I've tried to use SMTP on off (off sets
it back to sendmail use), and checked the default sendmail
flags but didn't see anything obvious.

My guess is that pine/sendmail wants to check the domain
names before posting the entries, while mail ignores this
and returns a bounce later. Is something like this the
case, or something else. It's a real pain to use a mailing
list with 10+ addresses and post something, I usually
switch over to non-pine in order to do this.

Thx, Kent
PS: This is the SGI port of Pine 3.95.

Yes, you can.
Use the 'E' export command to save the selected message to a file.
Then, use any FTP software to transfer it from your account to your floppy
disk.

When you hit Select, it will give you a choice. (A for all, N for number, etc.) 
Hit "number", and then it will let you select messages 1-100, or 3-45 and then 
56-478, or whatever.

So I'll never see my mail on disk. Our college doesn't work that way. :( Oh, 
well. Thanks for trying.

Check procmail or filter. Since you got Windows programs at home, you know
what to do there.

  >And a non-mail-bomb question, can I save mail from PINE onto a floppy disk?

Provided the floppy is mounted on your VAX, yes. Then e(xport) will do, as
well as cp <filename> /dev/fd0 on the CL.
Otherwise, check if you have the mtools installed an are allowed to use
them.

         FEATURE: enable-aggregate-command-set

Setting this feature enables the commands and subcommands that relate to
performing operations on more than one message at a time. We call these
"aggregate operations". In particular, the "; Select", "A Apply", and "Z
Zoom" commands are enabled by this feature. Select is used to "tag" one or
more messages meeting the specified criteria. Apply can then be used to
apply any message command to all of the selected/tagged messages. Further,
the Zoom command allows you to toggle the Folder Index view between just
those Selected and all messages in the folder.

This feature also enables the "^X" subcommand in the FOLDER INDEX WhereIs
command which causes all messages matching the WhereIs argument to become
selected.
     -------------------->snip here<---------------------------

Ok? Check the FAQ or the users guide, too... *mubmlemumble* :-)

If you go to the config (go to "setup" from the main menu and then
config) you can reset the user-domain= to whatever you want.

I believe that the Pine 3.96 distribution's imapd kit has been fixed.
Perhaps this message from Mark Crispin (one of the Pine Team) in reply to
a previous query may be of use to you:

| In the as-yet unreleased Pine 4.0 (and the current released imap-4.1

Subject: Folder collections on a vfat partition
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hallo,

when I try to run pine on my system under win95 and linux using the same
local folder collection, I have to put this collection on the
vfat-partition, because win95 cannot read ext2-Partitions.
But when I do so, Pine is not able to write to this folder collection on
"dos_c", although the user has all rights (umask=000 mounting dos_c) and
editing or deleting a file on dos_c is no problem.

Thank you for an idea!

No.  You're posting to a globally available mailing list, David,
and we have no way of finding out the pertinent information that
is essential to our being able to determine where the problem
might be.  What version of Pine are you using, and what
environment are you running it in?  What is the specific error
message?  Are there any other details you could tell us that
would help?

Has anyone ever heard of pine slirping mail into a user's mbox (with
3.96) when running with imap?  I have been running this way for
several months now and have had no problems but other users have.
Is there a flag in the .pinerc file or something in the code that
needs to be changed?  I would really appreciate any thoughts, since I
have yet to find any documentation on this problem but will keep
searching.

Subject: Folder is Unkillable
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I was experimenting with how to create new mail folders, and want to kill
off an experimental one.  I highlight it, hit "D", answer "Yes", and it
disappears.  I get a nice confirmation message to boot.  I've done this a
bunch of times.

But then when I open up Pine again, the damn thing is BACK!  I can't kill
it!! 

I've gone to $HOME and looked for it, thinking that I could rm it.  But
its not there.  I've even created it, gone into Pine and deleted it,
confirmed that it had disappeared from $HOME, and the little b*stard
reappeared when I next fired up Pine.

I think that I must be doing something wrong... :-)

Please help.

If you can't in any way erase the folder, have you tried to just rename it to a 
folder that you want to put in anyways? (I know it's probably bad advice, but if 
you can't get rid of it anyways...)

For starters, some sort of indication of what you're doing might be handy.
I use IMAP with pine, but no sort of "slirp" mode to get all the mail into
my inbox. I just read it from the remote folders, and save it, print it,
reply to it, scratch 'n' sniff it, or whatever, as if it were on the local
machine.

If you are running DG/UX 4.11 (Intel or Motorola) you can obtain the =

Ok, I actually found the answer to this.  By default the WU imapd
reads in (slirps) in a users mailbox into ~/mbox if there is a ~/mbox
present.  This is the default behaviour, you can change this not do
this by editing the makefile for imapd.  I thought that it was a Pine
problem but I was looking at the wrong thing.

Really. I think I can occasionally use such a feature. I'll have to look
into it. Thanks for the info.

Would it not be wise to also fix the flawed code as well?  The booby

I read through the archives for the list on the web site and saw that some
people had posted some requests for features.  I'd like to comment upon
some and add some

SIGNATURES: In UNIX you can create a named pipe that is a program which
will randomly create a signature.  There are examples of this in
/Programming Perl 2E/.  That's helpful, but it'd be nice to have certain
people receive certain signatures.  I don't mind my friends getting some
of my 'less polite' signatures, but it'd be bad if i posted the same to a
list or one of my clients.  Which leads to

CENTRAL ADDRESS BOOK: I know that this is a listed feature for an upcoming
release, but I wonder who is working on it.  I'm a competant developer and
would like to at least beta test if not more.  I use pine's comment
facility to track phone numbers, addresses, birthdays and such.  It'd be
nice if I could arbitrarily add fields.  I'd like to be able to use a
server for this so that I could share some entries and some fields with
others.  

One thing that should be part of this is better support for Fcc.  I have a
folder for each person I correspond with, but some people have several
email addresses.  If the username is different, this means i have to mung
through more than one box to find the correspondance for an individual. 
This is a bother.  So, it should be possible to define "alternative
addresses" for someone so that replies can be Fcc'ed properly.  Mailing
lists that change their name or maintain multiple 'inputs' would also be
helped by this.

INCOMING FOLDER CONTEXT: Different things should be settable on an folder
by folder basis.  I have all my mail forwarded to my main box and then
procmail'ed into a ton of incoming folders.  (This seems very common.) 
But when I respond to queries in one of my webmaster folders, the From: is
my address.  My main address already has too much stuff coming to it.
Reconfiguring for each reply isn't very practical.  If nothing else, it'd
be nice to be able to select from the alt-addresses already defined.  But
ideally signature, From:, saved-message directory, etc. should be able to
be overriden for a folder.

SCRIPTABLE: It'd be so cool if I could use pine from a script without
having to use expect (or the appropriate perl equivalent).

ObDisclaimer: I love pine.  I greatly appreciate everybody who has
contributed to it.  I laugh at elm users.  I have a link to the pine site
from my web page.  The above requests in no way disparage the wonderful
product as it currently exists.  Its better than anything you can buy.
Thank you all.

I use linux as user `brf' but my e-mail address is like the one in my
signature (bootom of this message). PINE alway sets brf@net-point.de 
as my from-address. 

How can I force pine to put `Peter.Breitfeeld@net-point.de' in the
from-field of the header?

Pine does not allow you to change the "From:" header field unless it has
been specially built (compiled) to allow you to do so.  This is in an
attempt to cut down mail forgery.

Most people in a situation like yours simply set up a "Reply-to:" header
with their "correct" reply address in instead.  (That _is_ what this
header's for! ;-)

You can do this in Pine's Setup Configuration screen, by adding the header
to the "customized-hdrs" variable.  In your case you will want to add the
header along with a default value (that way it will get set automatically
for every message you compose):

	Reply-to: Peter Breitfeld <Peter.Breitfeld@net-point.de>

(Incidentally, your message already came through on the Pine Forum mailing
list as "Peter Breitfeld <Peter.Breitfeld@net-point.de>" ... are you sure
there's a problem?  ...It might be that some part of your site's mail
gateway is rewriting the "From:" header to the "correct" value anyway?)

Cheers,

Renaming it isn't what the customer asked for, Didier...

Ok, here's what might be wrong:

1. Check where your mail folders are. Probably not ~/ (or $home), but rather
   ~/Mail/ or something. You'll find the path in your ~/.pinerc or in the
   s(etup), c(onfig) screen within pine.

2. Say
	ps -ax | grep -i pine
   to see if another instance of pine is running that might make your
   session read-only. I suspect that this is the case because you cannot
   permanently change your setup.

3. If so, say:
	killall pine 
   to kill all running sessions. If that doesn't work, there is something
   wrong with your setup in general, so let's try to fix the problem
   manually:
   
4. Edit your .pinerc, e.g. by saying:
	pico ~/.pinerc
   and check for the following passage. Then make sure the format of the
   entry goes like this:
	
   # List of incoming msg folders besides INBOX, e.g.
   # ={host2}inbox,{host3}inbox Syntax: optnl-label
   # {optnl-imap-host-name}folder-path
   incoming-folders="test1"     ~/Mail/IN/IN.test1,
   	            "test2"     ~/Mail/IN/IN.test2,
                    "test3"     ~/Mail/IN/IN.test3
                
   Mark that there is no comma in the last line... Setting up folders in the
   way displayed here seems a good idea in general (and which I leeched from
   Nancy McGoughs fabulous mail filtering faq)

5. If you cannot edit your ~/.pinerc, it's set read-only (say: ls -al
   .pinerc to check that), either throw up your hands in despair and kneel
   before the altar of the helpdesk guys (a generous amount of humility
   always seems to be in place with them ...) or read a couple of man pages
   (which is a good idea in general, too...), e.g. pine, pico, chown, chmod
   and procmail. That should get you started
   --- or frustrated

Dear administrator,

I'm a new user of Pine mail s/w. Iam using pine ver 3.94. The problem I am
facing is that whenever I send a mail. The mail goes but the mail is not
stored in any folder or file. I want to read my sent-mails for future
ref.
Kindly help immediately, (if possible ).
Thanks and Regards.

Whenever you start Pine you see its Main Menu screen.  There's a very
useful option on there called "Setup".  If you use this, followed by "C"
(Configuration) you will find the Setup Configuration screen.

In this screen are lots of different variables and options you can use to
alter Pine's behaviour and appearance.  Each one has help information
available for it: just put your cursor onto the one you want to know about
and type "?" (Get Help -- it's in the menu of available commands at the
bottom of the screen).

The variable you are particularly interested in is called "default-fcc".
("Fcc" stands for "File Carbon Copy", and lets you automatically save a
copy of every message you send into a folder.  See the help for details.)

As far as I recall, Pine actually defaults to using a copy of every
message you send.  For UNIX Pine the folder these are put into is called
"sent-mail", whilst for PC-Pine it's "sentmail" (if memory serves).

You may like to check that copies aren't already being saved in such a
folder for you.  Use the "L" (List Folders) command at the Main Menu (or
most other places) and look for a "sent-mail" or "sentmail" folder).

However it may be that your Systems Manager has changed the default
setting, perhaps in order to conserve disk space.  As long as they haven't
"fixed" this value you can override this with your own value for the
option (I suggest using "sent-mail" for UNIX Pine or "sentmail" if you are
using PC-Pine).

Finally a hint for the future... when asking for assistance in this
world-wide discussion forum please use a more meaningful summary of your
problem for the Subject string.  "Help" doesn't really convey much!
Something like "Keeping copies of messages sent out" would be better.

Cheers,

--

that I could get foreign symbols in pine (version 3.91) simply by using
the "meta" key (marked with a diamond on my Sun keyboard).  Since then,
our system administrator has installed pine 3.95, and this now no longer
works.  (Meta-anything results in a beep and an "Unknown Command:"
message.)  I did check that this is not the result of some other change in
the system -- it is still possible for me to run version 3.91, and I can
still get the foreign symbols on that version.

Does anyone know anything about this?  Is there a setup option that would
allow me to get the foreign symbols again?  I am using a Sparc 20 running
SunOS 4.1.4 and Xwindows.

Thanks for your help!

I'd "ME TOO" that in general, but of course it's not a feature everybody
needs, and setting up a sending filter that can to that isn't such a big
deal. Since you're a "competant developer" (see below) and have "Programming
Perl 2E" (see above), it should be a cakewalk, shouldn't it? Do it, create a
patch, submit it, done. Everybody will love you, me included. TIA.

Ok, I hate GUIs... BUT, I'd like to advertise a program I found a couple of
days ago. It's called "addressbook" and is written in tcl/tk. It's a *very*
neat little program that will let you store all the information you
mentioned and more, and it will launch pine with a click of the little gray
rodent (don't mention the m-word *yukk*). But this might be what you're
looking for. Pine's got too much of an overhead as it is, imvho, and
bloating it even more would seem to be counter-productive. Here's the url:

If you did that with one of my cats, I'd sentence you to 5 months of using

I keep forgetting about all the uses filters can be put too.  But it'd be
a lot "cooler" to be able to have this happen without having to go through
picking a filter.  I already use filters for pgp, so I'd end up having to
choose whether to sign something or give it a signature.  Bleck.

I consider tcl harmful.  Durka's product is nice and I have played with
it, but I still avoid tcl-based tools if possible.  (Of course its not as
bad as csh.)

Think of each incoming folder as a 'persona' or 'role' that should have
appopriately associated From: email address, signature, etc.

Perhaps it's time for someone to start a library of Pine filters?

Subject: dealing with multiple mail servers
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Pine seems to be ideally suited to handle mail from multiple mail 
servers. Reading the mail works just fine, however, replying or
sending mail seems to be a problem. In any case, the mail is
sent through my local sendmail (or whatever I have in .pinerc's
'smtp-server='). However, the setting in 'smtp-server=' might
make sense for _one_ of the multiple mail server accounts, it
certainly is not suitable for all of them at the same time.

For instance, I maintain a default INBOX which is configured
to exchange mail with my ISP via UUCP. I also maintain a mailbox
on  another UNIX machine. Replying to a mail retrieved from this
other machine through my local sendmail.cf doesn't work though. I'd
expect that there is a way to send mail from Pine using the
IMAP protocol to the server where the mailbox is and leave it
up to the sendmail configuration on the server to actually take
care of the correct delivery.

Can anybody shed some light on this scenario? Is this something
that is supposed to work and just badly configured on my end or
is this something that can't work by definition?

Even cooler would be to have a screen that allowed a series of filters to

Err... no >:-> Being an "experienced programmer" (or whatever the exact term

Ok, show me a shell program that is as powerful and easy to handle, and I'll
jump for it. But for the "power user", having something to click on and to
open and close and stuff is always nice. Remember the people in the office

I really don't see the problem... How many filters do you want? Two, afaics:
pgp and signature. So that really isn't a problem. Use Aldo Valente's papp,
insert an additional "which signature do you want" filter, and you're there.

If I'm not totally mistaken, formail and not pine should be able to handle
the header part. It's u*ix world, after all. You don't want pine to become
u*ix's MS Mail, do you? (1,7MB is big enough, right?) I guess that the vast
majority of people can live quite well without the things you suggested
(after all, pine's supposed to be "simple"), and adding them if you
*personally* need them doesn't seem too big a deal. No offence intended, but
what you're asking for is, imvho, against the u*ix spirit. If God had wanted

Well, that's not a very general solution.  I already have two pgp filters
(one for signing and one for encrypting).  So I'd end up having to have
5 filters:
	Sign + random sig
	Encrypt + random sig
	Sign
	Encrypt
	random sig

If we come up with something else (and apprantly people have other
filters) then we'd end up with up to eleven filters.  The maintenance
of this is totally unnecessary if pine handled running multiple filters
cleanly.

And I do intend to send patches.  A lot of the reason I posted was to try
and coordinate with whoever I needed to.

They're more than welcome to work with GUI's.  My intent was to have a
server store the information (possibly LDAP or something similar) and have
pine be one of many clients for it.  If people want to use a GUI to access
it, fine.  But I'm not going to try and run X across a modem (when I'm
stuck in some German backwater where the dial tone puts Trent Reznor to
shame) just to be able to cut and paste from my address book into pine.

What is papp?

Really?  I don't see how.  How can formail determine what folder I was in
when I sent something?

The same logic easily leads us direclty back to mailx.  I don't want to
bloat the product.  I don't want to add features that confuse people.  The
beauty of pine is that these things can be cut on by people who want them. 
(And lots of local UNIXheads I know would cut all of the features on that
I mentioned.)  If I had to buy a bigger machine to run a pine with the
features I wanted, I would happily do so.  I sit in pine 24-7.  But
nothing I've talked about is going to require massive amounts of code.  In
fact, the address book stuff is already being considered for addition. 
And that code will be vastly larger than the folder-by-folder
configuration stuff.  As for, against the UNIX spirit, both pine and perl
are against the UNIX spirit.  You're more than welcome to go back and use
mh (or mailx) and sh.  They're perfectly in keeping with the UNIX spirit.

Here's one that's got me scratching what's left of my hair.  I used to 
receive my accented mail with no problem - all the accents showed.  The 
College switched me over to a Mac 7200/120 recently.  I dutifully went 
through my Settings - Configuration - Character-set routine - set my  
iso-8859-1 - accented messages still came out a mess!  Yesterday, I 
joined a local listserv and sent an accented message which came through 
back to me WITH accents - but messages that I've already received are 
still garbled.  So. . . what's up?  Thanks for your help.

Ok, KISS didn't work, so I'll try using ascii-art:

			    use filter?
			   /	      \
			yes		no
			 |		   \
			pgp?		send mail
		     /	     \
		yes		no
	     /      \		 |
	sign   or  encrypt?      |
	       \  / 		 |
	add random sig    or   send ?
			|
			V
		send mail or add another filte, etc., etc. ...
		
Got it? papp (Pine And PgP) is doing exactly the above pgp part, btw.

The German ISDN system is better than anything I've seen so far. Trent
Reznor doesn't sample dial tones. 

What's the problem of setting up a script that pipes the output of a Central
Database into pine's address book format?

Now I get it... Ok: "From:" isn't supposed to be altered (vulgo: "forged"),
anyway. Either use another "Reply to:", or set up another user. Since you're
answering as "different people", you'd want that, anyhow. One simple and
fast solution would be to run different instances of pine with different
folder collections and static configurations. I.e., as a webmaster, you'd
launch pine with an rc that has webmaster@foo.com as "Reply to:". Since pine
stays in the cache under u*ix, that would be a matter of seconds. This way,
you'd have only a few configurations, depending on "who" you are. Your way,
you'd have to maintain loads of configurations for various folders. I don't
think this is a wanted behaviour.

Ok, let's put it this way: Being a "competant developer", you can easily
UTSL and tailor your own version of pine. You can also make the patch
publicly available (as is being done with pgp-filters, e.g.). But -- again,
no offence intended -- I don't see any urgent need for your suggestions
being implemented in the general distrib.

C'mon, you know what I'm talkin about... Nobody wants an addressbook
specifically for pine. Rather, you want a global database with a front-end
that launches pine. That's why I suggested taking a look at Addressbook
(wwwmayr.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~durka/addressbook/), as it does exactly
that: It's got a database and a nice front-end and launches mail, fax, phone
and also can be piped into running applications like emacs (did I mention
that it can output TeX code?). So, you could pipe its (or any other
database's output) into pine address-book format, putting all information
that cannot be stored in appropriate fields into the comment field.

Well, whatever...

Later,
Robin

I'm not quite sure how Pine supporting multiple filters would help unless
it provided *at send time* some way of letting you select which of your N
filters were to be applied to this message.

I suspect this would involve dextrous finger activity selecting them from
a list (like Take Address uses)?

In which case you could still make use of similarly dextrous finger
activity to include some sort of special line in your message which a
single Mega-Filter could detect, remove, and use appropriately...

Your above 5 filters could still be combined into one providing it picked
up (and then filtered out) some sort of special string _within the message
text_.  For example the last non-blank line, or perhaps one starting
with an unusual string such as "#|".

If this configuration string used (say):

	P	to indicate PGP handling with suboptions like "s" for
		signing and/or "e" for encrypting

	S	to indicate signature handling with subtoptions like
		"r" to indicate a random signature or "f" for a
		flame-style signature (especially for Robin to use!)

Then your above five examples of different combinations could then be
indicated by including a line of the form: 

	Sign			...	#|Ps
	Encrypt			...	#|Pe
	Sign + random sig	...	#|PsSr
	Encrypt + random sig	...	#|PeSr
	random sig		...	#|Sr
	Sign + Flame sig	...	#|PsSf

Things could be further shortened by condensing option/suboption pairs to
single characters.  For example:

	PGP sign	= p
	PGP encrypt	= e
	Random sig	= s
	Flame sig	= f

which would then shorten above examples to:
	
	Sign			...	#|p
	Encrypt			...	#|e
	Sign + random sig	...	#|ps
	Encrypt + random sig	...	#|es
	random sig		...	#|s
	Sign + Flame sig	...	#|pf

Just a thought.

Cheers,

Subject: Can't print all of the attachment
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Using procomm only get the first line of each paragraph.

If I start to forward the email (to see how it looks) I can see a $ at the 
end of the terminal line and moving the cursor to the right, the line 
continues. There doesn't appear to be any wrap, just one long line for each
paragraph.

The attachments that don't print always have.. "The following text is in 
ISO-8859-1 character set your display is set for the US-ASCII character 
set some characters may be displayed incorrectly".

I can print successfully locally but not via Procomm.  Have tried every 
emulation mode and Procomm option that I thought was relevant.

Printing remotely via Netscape, the results are the same.

Pine 3.91, Procomm V2/DOS, Windows 3.12, SunOS 4.1.3,  Term=vt100 in the 
ENV variable.


Thanks for any help you can give.

It pains me to say this, but I was more impressed with Bell Atlantic.  Of
course, half of my complaint was that getting any packets back to the
states was nearly impossible.  (One packet every two minutes.)

He wouldn't need to sample the dial tones in Germany.  He could go
direct to CD.

Because editing would be nice and sticking everything in the comment field

I tried running pine under different accounts.  But its not as efficient
as the tab key.  Having different rc's would be easier, but the only
difference would be that I wouldn't have to type a password for each.  To
check mail would require cycling through 20 accounts.  Bad idea.

On the "Reply To:" versus "From:" issue, I'd rather maintain the
appearance of multiple people a little better.  People ignore Reply To:
way too often.

No.  My way would only require maintaining as much per folder as you
wanted to.

I intend to make patches available.  A lot of my purpose in posting was to
see if anybody else was working on these things since some of them are on
the official to do list.  I wouldn't consider any of this "urgent" either.

pine can't be called from a script.  That's rather against the spirit of
UNIX.  perl goes entirely against the 'simple tool' philosophy by throwing
everything together into one tool that (if you need it to be) isn't very
simple.

That's what LDAP and addressbook are for.

No, you want a back-end that's accessible through pine.  Pine is already a
front end for a weak address book functionality.  I'm just trying to
'open it up' by allowing it to work against a backend.

I was thinking that it would be a screen that would look like the options
screen.  You could use x to check off filters, and reorder them using some
other keys.  (Of course this wouldn't come up if you didn't have
enable-multiple-filters checked in your config.)

Dear Pine-fans,

how do I set Pine up to send mail through an alternate SMTP server, i.e.
not through sendmail? (I'm using Pine 3.95 under Linux 2.0.27)

Thanks for your help.

	Carlo

I have a question about attachments. I need to know how to pull them up in
the pine program. I have saved it to my home-directory like it said to but
then it says that it does not know how to bring it up. What do I do?

If your statement is genuine, I don't think anyone on this mailing 
list/newsgroup will be able to help you.  Try IRC, you'll find lots 
of people to talk to.

If if it not genuine, try

1. Enter a subject line... *argl*

2. Name the system you're working with... (DEC OSF?)

3. Pine is a mailer --- not a viewer or whatever... You need an application
that can digest the attached file. Certain files-types can launch their
appropriate apps if you have a mailcap file set up. Check the f(ine) manual
for that ... It's called 
	man metamail

Later,
Robin

Now, rodallub@eco.uncor.edu, what you really want to do is try to post your

Just to make sure that it works, send a couple of mails, because they
sometimes get lost. But don't let that discourage you --- your idea is a

Hello:
	I'm using Pine 3.94. About one month ago, I received a message at
the bottom of my screen re: On/off preserve-start-stop character, which
would not go away.
	I followed the instructions to "X" that box in the Config area.
Since then, I have not been able to print any of my messages successfully.
It will print half of the message, stop and the whole system freezes.  I
have to restart my computer and try to get in again.  It works fine unless
I try again to print a message.  Then it freezes again.
	Hope you can help get my old system to working 100% again.
	Thanks,  Cherie Zahora

Hi,

How do I "access" the "attachments" being sent to me via Pine.  I follow
the commands on the screen, but get nowhere.  Please route me to the
information I need to make this work.  Thanks.

Dear sir,

	We are using PINE version 3.93 under UNIXWARE 1.1.4 . All the 
options except for POSTPONE and REPLY are working fine. When we use
POSTPONE option the system keeps doing /-\ for about 3-4 minutes and 
after that it gives the following message

Mailbox /home/alka/mail/postponed_msgs is locked, will override in
270 seconds.

After that it keeps showing lesser and lesser seconds till finally
it becomes zero. 
But even after that the postpone folder is neither created nor the
message postponed.

As for REPLY option the system is giving the e-mail address of the
receipient twice i.e. it is taking the UUCP as well as SMTP address
formats both. This is inspite of the fact that we have completely
disabled the UUCP in the /etc/mailsurr file.

It would be kind of you if could suggest us the solution for 
removing these problems. 

Thanking you.

First, view the attachment by pressing 'v' (ViewAttch).  Choose the
attachment (Application). Then save it to a file - 's' (save) - it's
supppose to be in the home directory. Then view the file with any viewer
which is appropriate with the file type.

Hope, it's useful,

 If you run the korn shell you can set the MAILPATH environment
 variable to point at several mail inboxes and add a little string
 to notify yourself which box has gotten new mail. For example

 MAILPATH=$HOME/mail/bob?"You have mail from Bob.":\
 $HOME/mail/susan?You have mail from Susan."

The environment variable MAILCHECK will tell ksh how often, in seconds,
to check the mail inboxes for new mail.

I wrote this web page.  

I got a Perl script from David Roberts that does the same thing as the
display.csh.  The Perl script pauses after decryption until I hit the 
RETURN key.  The shell script is supposed to do the same, but it doesn't.  
So, I like the Perl script better.  I have attached it at the end of this 
article.  Try it!

Enjoy!

    Pine by itself cannot do any of these things.  It was not designed
to.  You want to do something called mail filtering, which hooks into
the mail delivery process before Pine ever gets into the picture.  
There is no single way to do this.  In part it depends on what
operating system you are using.  If you have a World Wide Browser,
browse my home page, follow the link to Nancy McGough's pages, follow a
couple of links in, and you will find ample information on mail
filtering.

    Yes.  Someone else already answered this question.

Subject: pine IMAP -- turning off rsh attempts
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi, I use pine as my e-mail program, and it's great.

One of the mailboxes I access is available through a direct IMAP
connection, though I cannot login to the machine directly with "rlogin"
or "rsh" (probably due to something like TCP wrappers).

The problem is that when I do an "rsh mailhost", it takes something like
5 or 10 seconds for me to get a "connection refused" message back, and
when opening an IMAP folder, pine seems to try doing the equivalent of

	rsh mailhost exec /etc/rimapd

before the equivalent of

	telnet mailhost imap

The result is that I must wait 5 or 10 seconds for the rsh to fail
every time I open the mailbox.  This is annoying when I use the TAB
key to scan my many mailboxes for unread messages.

So, my question is whether there's a way to tell pine that a folder
is accessible through IMAP but not through rsh'ed imap, preferably
on a folder-by-folder basis, i.e. something like this:

	{mailhost/user=me/norsh}INBOX

where the "norsh" is the fictitious flag I just made up that would tell
pine not to attempt to use the rsh command (since it's always always
always always going to fail).

E-mail replies would be appreciated.

  - Logan

Subject: PC-Pine for Win32 and filenames with spaces
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

PC-Pine for Win32 seems to choke on any filenames with spaces in them.  For 
example, if I try to attach a Word document with name "C:\My 
Documents\Word.doc", it will try to attach c:\My and Documents\Word.doc.  This 
happens if I type the name myself or if I use the dialog box to select this 
file.

I have tried putting quotes around the name, but this leads to problems 
becasue Pine then thinks that the filename is actually a comment about an 
attachment rather than the file to attach.

Is there any workaround for this other than to store all files in directories 
without spaces in their filenames?  I would really like to be able to use the 
dialog box to be able to pick out what file to attach.

                               Signature Dashes
                                       
   The "signature dashes" actually is a line which is used as the first
   line of a signature. This is described in the "son-on-rfc1036":

	If a poster or posting agent does append a signature to an article,
	the signature SHOULD be preceded with a delimiter line containing
	(only) two hyphens (ASCII 45) followed by one blank (ASCII 32).

   As someone said: "Feel free to disagree all you want." ;-)
   
   The sigdashes act as a seperator which allows easy recognition of
   signatures. This line consists of two dashes and a trailing space, ie
   "-- " (note the space) and thus can be recognized in a data stream as
   the character sequence "(newline)(dash)(dash)(space)(newline)". Some
   programs recognize a signature by the (sigdashes). It's exactly that!
   
   Let me make this perfectly clear: There are no additional characters
   before, after or in between. This means no whitespace before the
   dashes, no additional dashes, one space at the end, followed only by
   an newline which ends the line. That's it!
   
   One day all programs showing mails and articles will be able suppress
   signatures if you don't want to see them. Some programs enforce the
   use of sigdashes, eg [1]ELM, [2]MUTT, and [3]SLRN.
   
   Take a look at these picture pages to see examples of sigdashes in use:
   
   SLRN Picture page:
   [4]http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/slrn/pictures.html
   
   Please Give others the chance to make use of this feature, too. Use
   sigdashes whenever appending you sig to email or articles! Thanks!

The source distribution in the UW IMAP toolkit should compile on SCO.
There are "sco" and "sc5" ports, depending on which version of SCO you
are running.  It is available from

	ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z

Yes.  We are using only IMAP4rev1 servers on our centrally managed
systems and have no problem with Pine 3.96.

The first thing to do is find out whether there a newer version in the good
hope that the bugs have been fixed.  Well, there is a newer version: Pine-3.96

Upgrade!

I have been using Pine 3.91 on a Unix decstation.

On several ocassions (perhaps 6 times, over a year), I have had messages 
appear in the middle of my mail box - marked new - months after they 
were sent.  Some of these were pertinent enough that I am quite sure 
that they were indeed unread.

On one ocassion, our system manager checked a back-up tape (months old), 
and found that the messages were in fact in my spool file at the time.  
It appears that Pine was not seeing these messages.

Our system manager then switched our installation to Pine 3.90.  The 
moment that I first ran 3.90, three more messages surfaced (each a couple 
of months old) that 3.91 had not seen.

In frustration, I decided to give Elm a try.  I get the following error 
message which I suspect may be related:

	Reading in /usr/spool/mail/rodning, message: 456
	newmbox - length of mbox. != spool mailbox length!!

	Write to temp file failed, exiting leaving mailbox intact!

I realize that the above will likely sound strange.  I have accounts on 
various machines at diverse locations, and I've never heard of problems 
like this.  Any ideas?

thanks

Sure, reading the f* manual... Pine is an email program, not a filter. Read
*yawn* Nancy McGough's filtering faq at:
   
   http://www.smartpages.com/faqs/mail/filtering-faq/faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   
And... not signing a message if you don't even have your real name in your
address is quite rude... Why don't you get the email-faq, too, before you
bore everyone to death with your FAQ.

By talking to the people at your helpdesk. Since you didn't provide any
information about your system, there's nothing substantial that can be said.

What you're asking for is mail filtering and has *nothing* to do with pine.
Read the help that comes with pine:

  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of other
programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For details on
selection and configuration of such programs, see the Filtering Mail FAQ (by
Nancy McGough) at one of the following locations:

I have several folders in mail/ which are read very infrequently and it would
be nice to have them gzipped up to save space. But of course that turns them 
into  Application/OCTET-STREAM which can only be viewed and saved and so this
doesnt help me.

Has anyone used/written/seen/known a way to do something like this?

The simplest way of suppressing Pine's attempt to use rsh to establish the
IMAP connection is to append ":143" to the hostname in the folder
specification.  (If the IMAP server is running on some other,
non-standard, port then use its number instead.)  Thus:

	{imap.your.machine:143}inbox

If you want to turn off the rsh use for _all_ of your IMAP connections
then edit your .pinerc file and set the "rsh-open-timeout" variable to the
value 0.  (You can't do this through Pine's Setup Configuration screen as
it is not something users are expected to do often.)

Alternatively, and perhaps better from your point of view, is to ask the
Systems Administrator of the IMAP server whether they will consider
setting up a pre-authenticated IMAP service.  To do this they will need
to:
	1.  Set up a symbolic link from /etc/rimapd to their real IMAP
	    daemon executable.
	2.  Enable rsh access for you (and others).

If they don't want people being able to rsh into their IMAP server machine
and executing other commands there they may have to write a little
"blocker" program to use instead of a normal shell for the users.  This is
the route we have taken; the blocker program only allows /etc/rimapd
command to be given.

Cheers,

Direct solution: none

Workaround:

a) folder collections

b) script that unzips / opens pine / zips

c) zcat | .myfilter (*) | less

a) and c) are the ones I prefer. I keep my *really* old mail stored in a
separate dir and only check it when I'm looking for something. The filter
does a couple of grep -v to make the mail better readable. printmail does
the same.

Folder collections aren't much of a help, except in connection with b). Then
you could start pine for that purpose via script when you need the old mail.
Since u*ix keeps pine in the cache, opening/closing is a matter of 1 second.

Later,
Robin

Hi..

I'm trying to set up pcpine on my local pc for remote
access to another system.

It works fine and I can see and manipulate my inbox
and all my folders.  

However, when I try to create a message and send...
it gives me either a message that it I have an
"imap create argument missing.

I've tried very hard to get the syntax correct
with the following folders below but something
is missing.  The path to the folders is not
correct because when i send the message it
it tries to find the sent-mail folder and
can't find it.

Does anyone know where I can find IMAP
create arguments?  I've tried looking through
the site http://www.imap.org but I can't
seem to find what I need.  



default-fcc              = {my.mailhost.com}mail/sent-mail
default-saved-msg-folder = {my.mailhost.com}mail/saved-messages
postponed-folder         = {my.mailhost.com}mail/postponed-msgs


thx.

Kathleen

Sending attachments with ELM isn't easy.
They either have someone do something for them
or do something they don't understand.

Hp, eh?  Anyway, tell those clowns to upgrade to ELM2.4PL25 first.
Why bother about old versions, anyway?
First time I've seen the header "X-Vue-Mime-Level: 4", btw.
You can get ELM from the ELM distribution page:

I got pc pine and set it up and it work great, what version of imapd
are you running.  I tried this out on 95, running pine3.96, conecting
to a imapd4.1 using the following lines and it worked fine the first
time.

inbox-path			{my.imap.server}INBOX
folder-collections		{my.imap.server}mail/[]
default-fcc			{my.imap.server}mail/sent-mail
default-saved-msg-folder	{my.imap.server}mail/saved-messages

If you are not already running imapd4.1 you should think about
upgrading, at least for the security fixes.

I am using Pine 3.95 on a linux setup.
Whenever I get a message that was composed in a character set other than
the US Ascii set I get a warning such as listed below.
	I would like to know if there is a way of disabling this warning,
as it's a bit annoying and to my knowledge I have not benefitted from it.

[The following text is in the "iso-8859-1" character set]
[Your display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set]
[Some characters may be displayed incorrectly]

	Thanks for any assistance.

Well, you can always patch the source... But if it's mainly iso-8859-1, you
can change your character set in the setup. It won't do any harm, since
us-ascii is a subset of iso-8859-1.

Subject: procmail'n'pine oddness
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Something odd I've been reflexively working around for several months now,
to wit: procmail interacting oddly with pine on a particular platform.

On a certain linux box, the two interact *nearly* seamlessly -- procmail
filters, inspects, and delivers, and pine periodically polls my system
inbox as well as whatever local box I'm reading to tell me if/when new
mail has arrived.  Mail comes in several messages at a time, locking all
seems to work, etc. 

On a certain SunOS 4.1.4 box, pine chokes and dies when it discovers that
procmail has touched the box it's reading.  "UNEXPECTED CHANGES TO
MAILBOX," it says in its inimitable all caps way.  "(try restarting):???"

peeping procmail's log, I find that procmail hasn't seemed to have a
problem:

[see appendix A]

and indeed, when I restart pine, everything seems hunky dory.  

The aforementioned linux box has performed this stunt maybe 2 times in the
past 8 months.  The SunOS box does it hourly.

My first thought: Permissions'n'umasks!  But that wasn't it.  I'm 027, my
.procmailrc says 027, all the files concerned are correctly owned.

My second thought: file locking!  But giving procmail explicit lockfiles
didn't seem to change anything.  (still could be that pine objects to
having its files locked, even briefly, but it would be totally new
behavior to me...)  In addition, the fact that as pine tells me to restart
its own internal indexing has gotten badly munged makes me think that it's
something much more insidious. 

So I turn on pine's built-in debugging.  (read: built-in oversharing, on
demand.)  

[see appendix B]

So I'm still not sure what's causing this, and I guess this whole
overlong letter boils down to this:

Anyone got a clue on why this might be happening?  Is it just SunOS?  Am I
nuts?

A

p.s. my other question is why certain mail-agents (Eudora in
particular) put four ^A's at the end of their messages, but that's a
problem for a different letter, I think.

Yes, mutt and slrn.  They replace Pine quite nicely.  Check them out!

Hello:

I'm running 3.96 PC-PINE Beta, and when I try to print an email, about
half the time it prints fine, and the other half I get a Windows Page
Fault, which forces me to exit Pine and lose all my unsaved work.

Any ideas, please?

thanks,

Dave Katz

I recall reading somewhere that Sun machines use a slightly different
mbox format.  Check the man page for "formail".

Anyone ever start a browser based on a url in a mail/news message?

I have been trying to start lynx via something like this:

<PIPE> grep http | xargs lynx <RETURN>

Tried several different variations (Raw, un-captured, etc).

Any success stories?

whatsoever when procmail delivers a message to the mailbox I'm reading.
I don't think that's the problem.

Sure, lots of people know the answer to that one...

*But* that question has nothing to do with PINE...

Hi,

I think I found a really annoying bug in Pine 3.96. (Even 3.95)
Every time I compose a long message, and then I suspend, and view the 
files in my home directory, I find a file named: #pico00023# where 
00023 is pine's process id. The problem is that it creates this file 
according to my umask! :( I have my umask set to 022, that means while 
I'm composing my lengthy message on the, everybody can read the 
message I'm sending!

This is what I thought of:

1) Write a front-end script that will set my umask to 077 
   when I enter pine, and 022 when I exist.
2) Hack the source, so it will set the right permission when it 
   creates the file #pico12345#

I'ld probably think the second solution would be the best (if not the 
first). Looking at the help file, this is what I find:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------
| NEW FEATURES IN 3.92
| 
| COMPOSER IMPROVEMENTS  (yeah right!)
| 
|  o Composer checkpointing (Look for files beginning with: #pico... )
| 

Checkpointing? What's that suppose to mean. And apparently, it doesn't 
seem like it "checks". Looking at "other.c", I found:
+----------------------------------------------
| pbuf.ckptdir       = checkpoint_dir_for_pico;
I don't even know if that's relevant.

Do you have any suggestions, or found simiar problems? Is it my pinerc 
file? I'm attaching it just in case.

Does anyone have any idea, suggestions, or similar problems? Is it my 
pinerc file?

Also just a question on the side, under Pine, when I reach the end of the 
page, it scrolls line by line, how can I change this behavior to instead 
scroll by page. The only thing I found in the configuration, was how far 
(from the bottom or top) you want to start scrolling line by line, which is 
not what I wanted.

Also, I couldn't figure out how can I make new versions of Pine, 
highlight what I search for.

Thanks a lot!!

Hussam :)

Almost there - check http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/utils.shtml -
there isn't a PGP-aware pine like they have for elm, but with the
aid of a simple filter, you can do it - (as described in 
http://www.pharm.med.uc.edu/~yuan/pine_pgp.html), or a simple perl script 
- papp (http://www.rhein.de/~aldo/pine.html).

I believe these are referenced under the FAQ as utilites & add-ons or 
something like that.

>From the tech-notes (3.95q):

   PC-Pine reads and writes local (PC) folders in a special format
   similar to the Tenex format. Near as we can tell, PC-Pine is the only
   program to use this format. Beginning with version 3.90, PC-Pine
   includes a Read-Only driver for the Berkeley mailbox format in
   addition. That means that you can import Unix mail folders, or mount
   them via NFS or SMB, and PC-Pine can read them --but not modify them.

IOW they've fucked up again, perhaps it's fixed in 3.96 or 4.*
I'm not holding my breath, they'll tell you to run an IMAP server
on the UNIX box for PC-Pine to connect to. <sic>

	Well, more precisely, *any* file you create can be read or copied 
by any other user on the system if you have a umask of 022. This is *not* 
a bug with pine. Why not re-set your umask? Enter "umask 77" for it 
only to be readable only by you. Even better, to save yourself the typing 
in the future, put "umask 77" in your .login or .cshrc file.

	Again, this is *not* a bug in pine.

Subject: Attached-to-ansi Printing and Linux
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I would like to print my e-mail directly from a remote PINE (my ISP's)
to my local LINUX box.  I use C-KERMIT to log in.  I have the PRINTER
configuration in the remote PINE set to 'attached-to-ansi.'  However,
when I press 'Y,' the text just flashes by on the screen and does
not print off on my local Laserjet Series II printer; however,
everything works fine when I log in to my ISP from DOS using MS-KERMIT.

I have consulted my ISP and he says it should work.  He even directed me
to use a programme called 'lpansi' to test it out, but the results are
always the same.  I have used 'vtprint' command on the remote KERMIT and
everything just appears on the screen as usual.

What have I done to test it out? 

I have set my local PRINTER variable to PRINTER=lp
PRINTER=/usr/bin/lpr and possibly a few others.

I have used the LINUX 'console' for terminal emulation and have also
tried vt100 on my local LINUX box.  My ISP is set to vt100 and I have
also set KERMIT to the same terminal emulation.

I have tried the followoing commands on my local KERMIT:  set destination
printer set printer lp, or set printer /usr/bin/lpr. I am not really usr
how the environment variable PRINTER should be set in any case, but I
think 'lp' is the only definition that is correct since it is the name 
of the printer in /etc/printcap. 

If you could reply by e-mail I would appreciate it.

	I beg to differ.  umask only controls the "initial" vaule of the
file permissions.  Any program should then change the permissions, if
prudent, to reasonable vaules for in order to maintain the security of the
information.  A mail program should not leave it up to the user to ensure
their system is configured to makeup for the mail program's faults. 
Indeed the user may *not want* the default mask to be as restrictive as it
should be for mail programs. 

	That said, I started to compose an email with pine and then
simulated a communications failure.  I did not see the exact same
situation as described by the first individual.  However, pine did
leave a file in my home directory (.pine-interrupted-mail) with
permissions of 644.  This, IMNSHO, is *very bad*.

	Regards,

Are you sure it doesn't happen with shorter files? Just to make sure, type
500 hundred messages with the following line in the body:

"I shall RTFM before I post. I shall not spread rumours. I shall man bash."

Maybe it'll go away (many bugs have vanished this way in the past...).

KeWL... Since you know how to do it, why don't you go ahead and set it to
.077 generally? Your .<shell>rc would seem a good place for that ;->

A "front-end script"? Woah! Can I have one, too? (BTW, I've never thought of
pine as part of VR)

K. Hack it, make a patch, submit it --- done. What's all the fuzz about,
anyway? Pico sucks, almost everyone agrees on that, especially Sven "vim"
Guckes and Robin "Joe" Socha >:-> If you want to use pine "professionally",
you'll probably need another editor, anyhow. You've got emacs as your
alternate editor --- set it up to store the tmp files in a "secure"
directory...

AND...
Even if it had been a bug, submitting the report to the list first
doesn't seem the best option imnsho. Ever tried M(ain), B (Report Bug)?

Have a nice weekend,
Robin

I do WANT people to read files *I* create, but I do *NOT* want them to 
read my mail! I *DO WANT* my umask to be 022.

> 	Again, this is *not* a bug in pine.

Yes, when people can read your personal stuff, then that's a bug.
Have you noticed (even when setting your umask to 000), when you first 
invoke pine, it'll create a ~/mail directory with permisson 700 ??!
Now you've got to tell me, one of them has to be a bug.

My problem is not changing the umask. I want my umask to be 022. But I 
don't want people to read the messages I send!! 
If creating the file ~/#pico00023# with permissions as my umask is 
considered a feature, whey the file ~/dead.letter it creates is set to 600?
I need an explanation. It is a bug.

Besides people, before flaming at my message, so for *NO ONE* has 
answered me with a solution. Did any one notice, I had another part in my 
message??

Does a version of IMAP4D, that can be installed on a SCO 5 system,
exsist somewhere  ?

Can Pine 3.96 (both PC and UNIX version) communicate with an IMAP4
server ?

Well, since it creates the "mail" subdirectory (for its mail folders) with
a umask of 077, *IMHO* it would only seem reasonable that it would save
the checkpoint files with the same permissions. Why should the work in
progress have other permissions than the ones that are finished (i.e saved
to the folders)?

In your .pinerc file, try this line:
# Name/path of inbox. (Folder path name or "{host}inbox" for remote IMAP
inbox)
inbox-path={umabnet.ab.umd.edu}/var/spool/mail/help

(or wherever your mail is spooled to.)

	I believe you are missing the point.

	A mail UA should have security in mind.  Thus, it should have the
where-with-all to ensure that any of the files it creates (or programs
called on its behalf create) have the proper access rights to provide the
level of security one would expect from a UA.

	It isn't polite to make mock of a proposed work-around to a bug
or even a preceived bug.

	So, you think all problems should simply be sent in as a bug
report and not discussed on this list?  Don't you think that is 
counter productive?  I'd rather hear about what others have found and
consider a bug than to have to find them all myself.

	I don't believe the original poster classified writing the
checkpoint file as a bug.

	It is certainly *not* reasonable for any program which should
have security in mind to simply use whatever is set as the umask when
writing files.

	It is unreasonable to suggest that every program being run
have as part of its instructions, "remember to set your umask to XX
and and then set it back to what you want for other operations".

The script that was presented doesn't make tons of sense to me.  Why not
just have a script (or alias) called 'mypine' (or whatever) that does the
umask then runs pine?  The umask doesn't (AFAIK or could imagine) carry
back to the shell that this was invoked from.

No, there is not. (Pine does automatic checkpointing of state changes back
to the mail file.)

You can open a folder read-only with the -o flag, in which case it will be
untouched.

That's true, but unfortunately you're caught in the crossfire between
the University of Washington and Solaris.  Solaris has weird and
poorly documented ways of setting and using the domain name(s) of a
host, and these methods have several nasty properties.  For example:

* There is no simple and reliable programmatic way of obtaining the
current host's mail domain name(s).  Programs that need this domain
name adopt a variety of weird strategies to do it.  The most reliable
way is to have a configuration file as shown above, so that you don't
have to worry about Solaris brain damage.

* Hosts can be in more than one domain.  The NIS+ domain name is
not necessarily the same as the DNS domain name (and if you know why
this should be so then you know more than most Solaris system
administrators :-).  And a host can be in more than one DNS domain
(see e.g. the `search' directive in resolv.conf -- oops, sorry, that's
not documented either).

* If you send mail to the current host using the normal mail tools
supplied with Solaris, your resulting mailbox won't conform to RFC 822,
because it won't have proper domains in the mail headers.

The U of W folks's attitude towards this sort of thing is ``Solaris is
broken -- fix it and then use pine''.  To some extent I'm sympathetic.
Unfortunately, you'll have to do some nontrivial sendmail configuration
file hacking to make the U of W folks happy.

If I were you, I'd quit while you're ahead.

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Some do, but I don't think it is common yet.  I think some of the
newer servers are providing combined services...

Perhaps more to the point: there are some very popular IMAP servers (e.g.
UW's and CMU's) that can be configured to export news via IMAP.

Anybody knows why I can't select any messages, I just get:

  [Command ";" not defined for this screen. Use ? for help]

I'm running many version of pine under Solaris 2.51

Could it be the mailcap definition ?

    ";" invokes what are aggregate commands.  Before you can use ";"
you must first enable it in your personal configuration.  If you don't,
Pine will give you the error message.  (I personally have never
understood why this is even a configurable option.)

Yes, at least a beta version does.  See
ftp://ftp.celestial.com/pub/sco-ports/unix_3_2v5/imap-4.BETA.tar.gz

I've downloaded it and tested it with one of the Netscape Communicator
preview releases (PR2, I believe).  It seems to work for me.

: Can Pine 3.96 (both PC and UNIX version) communicate with an IMAP4

I don't know the answer to this one, but I'd check with
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.software to find out.  Good luck!

Well you can have pine remember your username, at least, for each remote
folder. in your .pinerc file, where you've set up the remote folders, for the
remote host, add in a /user=userid switch, so it will look something like:

label {host.domain/user=userid} folder

Doesn't remember passwords, though, and you don't want it to...

We have Pine on our Unix box with Imap turned on and from my
PC at home I can access my Inbox from the Unix box, but what I want
is also to have access to my sent-mail file on my Unix account.
I went into Setup/Config and changed default-fcc to {alpha6.drake.edu}
mail/sent-mail, but that didn't work.  My sent-mail file is in
the mail directory.
	Anybody have any ideas?
	Thanks in advance.

Actually, no.  Even if I set up 'dummy' addresses for people it won't work
when I try to save the message.  This also fails for some cases when
replying since you may want to reply to where the person emailed from even
if that username isn't their 'primary' one.

Send to an alias, automatically save in the proper folder, etc.  If I made
those functions from pine into some sort of library that could be linked
from pine, that'd be nice.

A classic example of this is when trying to have a CGI email a bunch of
people.  I /will/ remember to change the pine alias for an individual when
their email address changes, but I may well forget to change the email
addresses in all their CGI scripts.  If I could use pine from a script
(which would pick up on aliases) then it wouldn't be a problem.  I'd
change it in one place and all would be well.

I have been using Pine to read newsgroups.  For the past 3 weeks when
I try to access comp..mail.pine I get a message "[No state for newsgroup
comp.mail.pine, reading as new.]". It then proceeds to acces the newsgroup
but there never are any messages. Other newsgroups seem to be ok.
Does anyone know what is happening? 

Please respond to my E-mail address since I do not seem to be able to get
messages in the newsgroup.
Thanks.

AMEN!

I have gotten so sick of reading Mr. Socha's flames... the little useful
information contained in his postings is almost not worth the hassle of 
trying to extract it from all of the "fuzz" surrounding it!

I have sort of the same situation with PC-Pine..
I get this message:

Error not sending:  Host not found (#11004) smpt.whatever.com
(we have a smpt server)

inbox is


{mailhost.whatever.com}inbox

my default-fcc is set up just like yours...

I tried to go to imap and pine section at U of W
and use their suggested syntax...I can see all
my folders and manipulate them with ease..I just
can't send mail....

However, my unix account works just dandy if I
set it up as a remote.  Saves and sends mail
just great.

Help..

Kathleen

I think this is probably just eye/finger trouble.

The protocol is called "SMTP" (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), not "SMPT".

Therefore I suspect your server name should not be "smpt.whatever.com" but
instead "smtp.whatever.com"

Check the "smtp-server" variable's value in your Pine Setup Configuration
screen (it's name should have given you a clue to the problem! :-)

Cheers,

I believe work has been underway to seperate the processing elements
of pine into seperate core modules and for a completely seperate user
interface section. Will this philosophy (sp?) be exteneded in way
similar to the Apache web server ? A clean API may enable 3rd parties
to develope modules to support different graphical user interfaces for
pine as well as the standard text interface or different security
modules or different file managament modules ? Does this seem possible
or worth while ?

  is there anyway to setup one "global" address book
 for the users of the shared unix system, so they can look each
 other up if they forgot someones address or don't know it.

 It sounds possible?

 thanks

Will sendit.sh work with PC Pine for Windows 95 too?

Sure does. As a first step, look up the variable "Global-Address-Book" in
the M(ain), S(etup), C(onfig) section of pine. F1 will get you a help for
that.

Further information can be looked up in the pine FAQ and also in the pine
tech-notes. Both are available from:

       Pine Information Center:  http://www.washington.edu/pine
       Source distribution: ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z
       Pine Technical Notes, included in the source distribution. C-Client
       messaging API library, included in the source distribution.

Hope that helps.

Cheers,
Robin

I think this is probably just eye/finger trouble.

The protocol is called "SMTP" (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), not "SMPT".

Therefore I suspect your server name should not be "smpt.whatever.com" but
instead "smtp.whatever.com"

Check the "smtp-server" variable's value in your Pine Setup Configuration
screen (it's name should have given you a clue to the problem! :-)

Cheers,

Subject: custom headers help
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Does anyone know how to use custom headers?  I have already tried this:

	content-type: text/enhanced; charset="iso-9959-1"

I would like to be able to have pine automatically set the content-type
field based on the mail content.  Short of that I am willing to put in a
customer header to force the content type to be set.

Subject: Delivery Status Notification (DSN) ?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello,
 Has some kind of standard been reached upon how MTAs are supposed to do
Delivery Status Notification (DSN)? I remember reading something about this a
few months back but didnt see any follow-ups on www.imc.org or anywhere else.

The 'Return-Receipt-To:' header works only with a small percentage of SMTP (or
otherwise) servers out there and thus is not at all reliable as a means for
finding out if your mail actually reached its intended destination.

There were a few proposals for standardizing on and implementing this out
there. What is going on with all this? Bottom-line: how can I *reliably* find
out if my mail has reached its destination?

Thanks,
Vikas

    Sorry, wrong newsgroup to be asking.  This newsgroup is about Pine. 
A chat function has nothing to do with that.

	I was just wondering if I could look at old letters that I had
written to people.  I didn't know if they were kept anywhere and I was
wondering if you knew how I could get to them.

Thank you very much,
Lorrie Maxwell.

Pine support staff:
I want to set up a distribution list for a bunch of people I have in my
address book.  I read the Pine instructions which our computer lab gives
out, and it says there should be a "create list" command in my address
book.  There is not.  Is there a bug in my Pine?  Could you give me some
advice (concerning the address book only, please) as soon as possible?
Thanks.

If the recipient is willing to cooperate: Have him set up his local
delivery agent to generate return receipts for your messages. See, for
example, ftp://koobera.math.uic.edu/pub/docs/RFCNRUDT. Return-Receipt-To
is the most widely supported form of this solution.

If the recipient is not willing to cooperate: You're out of luck. There
is no reliable method. Note in particular that DSN reliably tells you
_something_, but the something is almost always ``Sorry, no receipt.''

How can I do a group mailing to all on a list *without* having each
person's e-mail address show in the header?

I bet there's a simple solution but I haven't in the Help files yet ...

Well, it depends... :-)

First, go to M(ain), S(etup), C(onfig) and check if you have this set:

	default-saved-msg-folder = 

Mine is ~/Mail/OLD/saved-messages, but yours might be something else...

Then check if this is set:

            [X]  save-will-not-delete
           
If so, your mail is still there. Goto the folder list, that's M(ain),
L(ist). There should be a file saved messages. Simply enter it and you're
there. Note: This is assuming that you're running a vanilla version of pine.
As I said, mine is set entirely differently, so if you can't find your mails
this way, come back later :-)

Cheers,
Robin

There is no "create list" command in my docs, but there are basically two
things you might referring to:

a) list mode, so you can mail to several people on the fly:
	goto the address book and type l, then select the people you want.

b) Distribution lists:
	The docu on these is rather exhaustive, so you should get the
	original docs from the pine information centre:

		http://www.washington.edu/pine
	
	For now, here's a little something from the user guide:
	
	Lists in the Address Book
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
| Panel      1996 Conference Panel             DISTRIBUTION LIST:         |
|                                              abc@somewhere.edu          |
|                                              Ross                       |
|                                              niako@xyz.co.jp            |
|                                              heinz@math.uni-irgendwo.de |
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Pine allows you to create distribution list entries in the address
	book. These list entries usually contain two or more addresses,
	which can be either complete email addresses, or nicknames defined
	elsewhere in the Address Book. In the example at the top of this
	page, the distribution list named 1996 Conference Panel contains -
	in addition to three "fully qualified" email addresses -- the
	nickname Ross, which is defined in the first entry of that Address
	Book. You can use an address book list entry to manage a small
	distribution list. When sending out a message, you just enter the
	nickname of the list in the To:, Cc: or Bcc: fields, and Pine fills
	in all the addresses on the list.
        
        
And from the faq:
        
The address field takes one of two forms, depending on whether the entry is
a single (simple) address or a distribution list. For a simple entry, the
address field is the email-address part of the address, i.e., the part that
goes inside the brackets (<>). It is combined with the fullname field to
form the complete address. For a distribution list, the <address> is in the
format:
      
	"(" <address>, <address>, <address>, ... ")"
           
Unlike the simple entry case, each of the addresses in a list can be a full
RFC 822 address with fullname included, or it may be just the same as in the
simple case. This way you can have a list which includes the fullnames of
all the list members. In both the simple and list cases, addresses may also
be other nicknames which appear in this address book or in one of the other
address books. (Those nicknames are searched for by looking through the
address books in the order they appear in the address book screen, with the
first match winning.) Lists may be nested. If addresses refer to each other
in a loop this is detected and flagged. The address will be changed to "****
address loop ****".

This should get you going, right? :-)

Robin

idea what those problems might be.

The approach CMU uses to send messages to newsgroups seems to me a bit
of a kludge.  We send an e-mail message to address that looks like the
following:

outnews+netnews.comp.mail.pine@andrew.cmu.edu

This makes it harder to reply to newsgroup messages from within Pine
than it should be.  I have to use one proprietary CMU e-mail program to
post to newsgroups, and Pine to write e-mail messages.  (We're in the
middle of switching from the proprietary Andrew Message System to a
more-open IMAP-based system.)

Can someone suggest a way for me to get around Pine's NNTP-server
requirement?  Ideally, whenever I would reply to a newsgroup message,
Pine would add an address of the form listed above to the "To:" line,
and would then delete the newsgroup from the "Newsgrps:" line.  Is this
possible?

Thanks for your help.

Say R(ich headers) and use the bcc (blind carbon copy) field.

No.  And there shouldn't be.  Use .forward or procmail.

Well, from the Mesage-Id: header, it is apparent that
crom@localhost.localdomain has NOT used PINE to post this to Usenet. Unless of
course, there is a way to have Pine NOT generate the Message-Id: header, but I
would think that involves some serious hacking with Pine/sendmail, etc.

So given that, your admonition about 'configure Pine correctly' is really
quite uncalled for. Or didnt you see the Message-Id: header before you blasted
off? 

Guys, please. Lets have some more tolerance here for the newbies. If you do
want to flame someone, do it by private email, thus displaying the fact that
YOU are not a newbie. 

For the record, I too, didnt like Robin's strong tone and thought it was
downright rude and insulting

As far as I know, the NNTP-posting-host is usually not the nntp server 
but rather the local machine that initially contacted the first real 
nntp server - if the server is explicitly noted it is usually as an 
NNTP-posting-server line instead. Looking further into the Path: line 
of the original message I found

nntp.sei.cmu.edu

which looks promising.

	I really cannot believe where this thread has lead to. I can't 
believe you call yourselves professionals with all this nonsense. 

	Mr Qasem stated that because pine does not automatically make its 
pico files readable only to its creator, it must be a bug. Hopefully all 
of us can agree this is not programming bug (which causes internal 
errors, crashes, and fuzzy warm stuff like that). Security bug? No, it 
this isn't either. 

	Why? 

	Well, everyone *should* know that there is no such thing as foolproof 
security, and that every user has a responsibilty of their own security. 
Clearly, most of the people here don't realize that. Applications can only 
assume so much about the individuals responsiblty of security. The user 
can't assume every application is going to take care of their security 
for them, but obviously most of you here do that. 

	Ok, so if this is not a programming bug or a security bug, then 
what is it? I would call this a "preferental" bug because this does not 
effect everyone on the same platform. It does not effect me, but it does 
effect people with a conflicting security ideology.  

	Let me review the background again... Mr Qasem has a umask of 22 
because he wants people to read his files, yet he is having a hissy fit 
because pine refers to the umask when is creates a file when he is 
composing a long email. This is *not* a good security stance at all. Its 
very conflicting. 

	Mr Qasem, the only two reasons I could come up with why you would 
want people to read all of your email was because you are sharing 
educational-related file (you are a student or instructor at indiana 
university) or you have files for your web page. If the files are 
education related, put them on your systems shared directory, which is 
usually /usr/share (which any competent adminstrator at a institution 
should have set up, and willing to assist you). If the files are for a 
web page, the standard is to put them in a sub directory (bus_html, etc) 
off of your home directory with the directory and its files the only 
files around with 755 permissions. Either way, you would need to change 
your umask. If the files dont fall in either two of these categories, 
then find another solution, which includes changing your umask. 

	I talked this over with a friend, who is more of a security and 
unix expert than I, and he thinks the same. You don't want to hear what 
he tought of some of responses on this thread. :)

	In other words, I'm behind Robin. From watching this list for a 
number of months, Robin is clearly competent in the field.

Does anybody know if (and how) you setup pine so the email is
automatically fowarded to another email address?

Keeping up with two email addresses is becoming quite annoying, although
the the second email is unavoidable in my situation.

Please help!!

PS  I've already spent a considerable amount of time reading up on
pine's internal help and have also visited the web site.  Unfortunately,
whenever I search for "Forwarding mail" I get intructions on how to
forward email I've received, and that's not what I'm looking for.

thanks,

Given that you're ignoring a valid user complaint we can reasonably place
you in the category of 'computer professional'.

Actually it is both.  The program should be consistant wherever possible.

That's WAY off base.  I DON'T assume every application is going to take
care of security for me.  That's why I read the source code for many
things.  Pine hasn't been one of them because I've found it to be rather
consistant and unbroken.  That applications "can only assume so much" is
not being violated by the perception many of us have about whether this is
a bug or not.  Pine already assumes "so much" in creating the mail
directory.  It should do this for other temporary files as well.

If its a 'preference' bug (which its not) then the behaviour should be
controllable and optional.

No.  Email is often vastly more private than the rest of what I do.  I can
always change the permissions on a specific directory to protect something
if necessary.

I didn't call myself a professional. I'm learning, and will always be. 
And that is *why* I posted to the forum in the first place.

I agree with you, but this is a "mailing" program, and it should preserve 
that while I'm reading, composing, deleting, my mail, nobody should read 
my mail.

That's right, I want to people read my files, not my mail.

Again, I don't want them to read my mail. Anything I'ld like to share 
with other people, is put in a directory with the right permission. (That 
includes my web page). But again, I do not want them to read my mail.
Perhaps I was mailing a student his grade, perhaps I was writing a test, 
I do not want people to read my mail.

Let me give you an outline of my problem again:
1) I want my umask to be 022
2) I do not want people to read my _mail_
3) Pine makes people read my mail!!

Here's the best solution I found (so far):
+--------------------------------
| alias   pine    (umask 022; pine)

I'm sure he is... Ok, how about forget about the first part of my 
message, and reply to my other questions? ;)
I had question about how to make new versions of Pine scroll page by 
page, rather than line by line when I reach the end/beginning of a page.

Thanks again for all of those who have responded.

[At great personal risk he dares to contradict Robin!]

Hi, Lorrie -

What Robin describes in his reply (included below) isn't, I think, what
you're actually looking for.

The "default-saved-msg-folder" he refers to is simply a folder that _you_
can save copies of messages you _receive_ into.  In particular when you
give the Save (S) command it is the folder offered to you by default to
save the message into.  (You can, of course, pick another one if you wish;
this is just the one offered as the default choice.)

In actual fact I think you were asking about referring back to copies of
messages you have written and _sent_ to others?  If so, then this is quite
a different thing...

Most mail programs don't keep a copy of messages sent out through them
unless specifically told to do so.  However the default for Pine _is_, if
memory serves, to keep a copy.  However it may be that the Systems Manager
of your computers has changed the default so copies are _not_ kept, in
order to conserve disk space.

Here's how to check...

*  Go to Pine's Setup Configuration screen by typing S then C at the Main
   Menu.

*  Look for a variable called "default-fcc".  If this is set to a folder
   name (typically "sent-mail" for UNIX versions of Pine, or "sentmail"
   for PC-Pine) then the chances are copies of your outgoing messages have
   been kept.

*  Leave the Setup Configuration screen by giving the Exit (E) command.

*  Now look at the Folder List screen (by giving the L command) and look
   for a folder with the name you saw against default-fcc.  Highlight the
   folder and open it by pressing Return.

"Fcc" stands for File Carbon Copy, and is used to File a (Carbon) Copy of
every message you send out.  (There are ways of overriding this folder,
but if you haven't been aware of it, you won't have done so.)

If you have the default-fcc variable set up then the first time you use
Pine each month it will offer to rename your current "sent-mail" folder
and start a new one.  The old one will be renamed to include the month and
year.  If you had any previous months' sent-mail folders around Pine will
offer to delete them in order to save disk space.

Cheers,

The "Create List" command in Pine's Address Book stems from older versions
of Pine, to which I suspect your documentation refers.  In Pine 3.95 you
just use the A (AddNew) command and then list the e-mail addresses in the
appropriate field.  It will will spot there is more than one address, and
automatically make a distribution list out of them.

Alternatively you can use the TakeAddress command to take addresses out of
one message (or more if you select them with the Select command) and
make/add to a list in your Address Book.

I have a vague feeling that you may need the
"enable-aggregate-command-set" option turning on in the Setup
Configuration screen before you can see/use TakeAddress, however I may be
mis-remembering.

Ummm... That's actually ^R (Control/R), and must be typed with the cursor
on any of the headers of the message you're composing.  (If you type ^R
with the cursor in the Message Text area it instead does a "Read File".)

Use the Bcc header if you are typing in a list of e-mail addresses.
However if you are using a distribution list, and are using Pine 3.393 or
later, put the list's nickname into the Lcc field instead.

You can see further help about these fields by putting the cursor on them
and asking for help by giving the Get Help (^G) command.

Ummm... if you take a quick glance at the Command Menu at the bottom of
the screen whilst reading a message you'll see:

                                      vvvvvvvvvvvv

                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Feeble attempts at highlighting mine.)

In particular:

	- and SPACE	Move you by whole pages (screenfuls)

	Up and Down Arrows
or	^N and ^P	Move you through the message one line at a time

Incidentally, you may also like to check out the following in the Setup
Configuration screen:

	viewer-overlap           = <No Value Set: using "2">
	scroll-margin            = <No Value Set: using "1">

The former lets you set how much overlap there is between screenfuls when
you move between them using - and SPACE (the default is 2 lines).  The
latter lets you say how close to the top/bottom of the screen you must
drive the cursor with the Up/Down Arrow Keys before it scrolls.

Better information is available in the on-line help for these: just put
your cursor on one of them and give the Get Help (^G) command.

Cheers,

That is unrealistic. Do you seriously expect a person to get in touch with al
the potential recipients of Email and find out if their Email system supports
the Return-Receipt-To: header? Thats the whole point of a standard, right?
something that all (most ?) systems support implicitly, without anyone having
to take pains about it!

Not in my experience. I would say that only about 50% or less mails I send out
come back with the Return-Receipt.

Well, wouldnt that suffice? If I get back some mail from the remote system,
even if it says 'No receipt', it is in response to my mail to that system so I
know that my mail has reached and that was my intent in the first place! Sort
of like  asking someone 'Are you asleep?' :). You get the point.

Do you know if the IMC or any other Internet standards body is working on
something to standardize on this isue so that one can reliably get a Receipt
to a email? 

As email is becoming a more mainstream form of communication, it
has to have these reliability features.

Vikas

so if i administer a site with 5000 users i should rely on them to provide
a secure mail system... no way! that is crazy! the whole idea of having
administration is to make the system safe and simple for the users...

granted... some of the responses to this thread have been way off the
topic (including mine)... but this is a security issue that should be 
addressed.


and please... lets try to focus on security from the angle of email...
security is a (understatement here) broad topic

agreed... but on this issue i guess i would be camping with Mr. Hicks 
and Mr. Qasem... i want my mail system to be as secure as possible... that
is my responsibility... not my users...

Frequently Asked Questions about Pine

  What documentation is available for Pine?
  
   The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
   online help. Additional documentation, including a User's Guide,
   Technical Notes, Questions & Answers, and information on where to
   obtain the software, can be accessed:
     * In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/
     * Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.
          + The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
            also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
            (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
            folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Who should I ask for help with Pine?
  
   If you need assistance with Pine, contact the technical support staff
   or computer help desk of your Internet Service Provider, school,
   university, employer, ... -- whichever organization provided you with
   the email account on which you are using Pine. Due to the large number
   of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington cannot
   provide individual support services to Pine users at other
   organizations.
   
   You may also be able to find the answer to your question through the
   Pine Discussion Forum -- see http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
     * If you are posting a question to the Pine Discussion Forum but do
       not subscribe to it, request in your message that replies be sent
       directly to you, with a copy to the forum. (Conversely, if you are
       answering a question in the Pine Discussion Forum, be sure to
       include the inquirer's email address in your reply, since s/he may
       not be a subscriber and will otherwise not see your answer).

  Why does command X not work?
  
   Some of the Pine commands you may read or hear about have to be
   explicitly enabled in the SETUP CONFIGURATION menu, which is accessed
   from Pine's MAIN MENU, to be functional. For example, to be able to
   use the "Bounce" command, the following feature has to be checked:
     [X]  enable-bounce-cmd

   and to be able to use the "Select"/"Apply" operations, you must first
   check:
     [X]  enable-aggregate-command-set

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I filter messages into different incoming folders?
  
   Pine does not perform delivery filtering; that is the function of
   other programs, such as (on Unix hosts) "procmail" or "mailagent." For
   details on selection and configuration of such programs, see the
   Filtering Mail FAQ (by Nancy McGough) at one of the following
   locations:
   
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq
   http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/mail/filtering-faq/
   faq.html
   ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/ii/internet/filtering_mail_faq.txt
   
   Once you have successfully set up your delivery filtering, you will
   have new mail arriving in several different folders, in addition to
   your INBOX. You can then access these folders just like any other mail
   folder. You can also define a collection of incoming message folders
   in Pine, through which you can then TAB to read new messages. For more
   information, see Pine's internal help on the enable-incoming-folders
   feature in Pine's SETUP CONFIGURATION menu.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I define my own headers like Reply-To and Organization?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Config. Move down to the
   customized-hdrs option and read the context-sensitive help screen.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Why does my message index show From: instead of To:?
  
   Applies to Pine for Unix only
   
   A number of Pine 3.95 users have reported seeing their own name,
   rather than the name of the recipient, in folder index listings of
   messages they have sent. This occurs when Pine detects the specific
   hostname of the computer on which it is running in the From: header.
   To avoid this from happening, set use-only-domain-name in Pine's SETUP
   CONFIGURATION menu to Yes; this strips the name of the specific host
   from your From: address. Alternatively, specify your domain name in
   user-domain (be sure you enter it correctly, otherwise all your
   outgoing messages will have an invalid return address! Ask your local
   computing support people if in doubt). When setting either of these
   options, also read the help screen for
   quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file to see whether you should enable that
   feature too.
   
   Administrators of systems where Pine exhibits this behavior should
   also check the /etc/hosts file for invalid entries; as an example, it
   should read:

  123.456.78.90   hostname.domain    hostname

   not just
  123.456.78.90   hostname

   -- otherwise, users' setting of use-only-domain-name to Yes will not
   have the intended effect.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail messages?
  
   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How do I send a message to multiple recipients without showing all their
  names?
  
   In Pine's message composer, with the cursor in the message headers
   area, press Ctrl-R ("rich headers"). Then read the context-sensitive
   help screens for the Bcc: and Lcc: fields.
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  How can someone without Pine decipher an attachment to a message I send?
  
   Pine uses the MIME Internet standard for attaching files to email
   messages. Any MIME-capable mailer should be able to "understand"
   Pine's attachments. If the recipient of your message with attachment
   does not have MIME-capable email software, they should be able to save
   the attachment to a file and then decode that. One freely-available
   program which can decipher a MIME attachment is munpack from Carnegie
   Mellon. It is available at:
   
   ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack
   
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Can Pine be used with a POP server?
  
   As of version 3.95, PC-Pine cannot be used with a POP (Post Office
   Protocol) server. Pine for Unix can be configured to access the
   message INBOX on a POP3 server using the folder definition syntax

        {pop3server/pop3}INBOX

   where pop3server is the hostname of the POP3 server. However, this
   method accesses the POP server in quasi-online mode, not in offline
   mode, which POP was designed for. Accessing the inbox on a POP3 server
   with Pine does not preserve changes to message flags (New, Answered,
   Deleted, etc.) between sessions.
   
   As an alternative, a program such as fetchmail (which supercedes
   popclient) can be used to download email from a POP server to a local
   Unix account, where it can then be accessed with Pine. fetchmail can
   be obtained from:
   http://locke.ccil.org:80/~esr/esr-freeware.html#fetchmail
   
   Note: support for the offline mode of email access (using either POP
   or IMAP) is planned for a future release of Pine and PC-Pine. For a
   more detailed comparison of the POP and IMAP protocols, see Message
   Access Paradigms and Protocols at the URL:
   http://www.imap.org/imap.vs.pop.html

	Does Pine 3.95 have an Auto Responder?  Some code that will 
automatically mail someone back a response if you are on vacation and the
response will specifically state that you are on vacation and will be
back on such and such a date.
	Thanks for your quick replies.

I'm having printing problems with Win-pine 3.96 32-bit and the current
IMAP4.1 Beta.  Occasionally I will get the message: 

Error starting print job:  Can't start document.

If I go back to IMAP2 on my server, then the problem goes away.  I tried
setting:

preserve-start-stop-characters

but it didn't help.  Any suggestions?  This happens on any of my machines
running Win-pine.

Thanks,

Ever lose keyboard arrows after adding Microsoft Exchange capabilities to
a PC? Internet/email connected through local department lan. Ctrl B, F, P
and N works fine. U of Arizona computer help desk is stumped on this one.

PINE currently does not have an automatic response system, nor do I
believe one will be implemented (except for the highly proposed killfile
machanism).  Use "man vacation" to get details on setting up an automatic
response.  It's quite easy to set up and practically does it for you.  It
even tells you how to disable it when you return.

Yes, I see... hmmm... Ok, being a UNIX Administrator, you should have your
system set with "apropos". Try saying

	apropos vacation

and you're there... 

vacation (1)         - reply to mail automatically

If you don't have vacation installed, you can use procmail with, e.g.,
ackmail.rc (to be got from an ftp server near you). Grepping the FAQ would
have told you that, too, btw.

Your problem are the above two programs. Have you tried getting the FAQ for
pine? There is a lengthy passage about how to set up printers with PCs
running Dos. Here's the (at least I hope so... ;-) ) decisive part:

 1. Check For Software Flow-Control Problems
    A. Try enabling "preserve-start-stop-characters" (requires 3.91 or later)
    B. If that doesn't help, verify that the OS is enabling s/w flow
       control; if it isn't, you can either change that in a global
       .login script, or as a worst case, wrap pine in a script that does
       it.  By the way, on our AIX systems, we had to execute "stty -ixon"
       followed by "stty ixon" --no one here knows why the first stty
       is needed.  (Note that explicitly enabling s/w flow control in the OS
       will not be needed in 3.92 or later).
    C. If neither of the above apply, double-check that you actually have
       *some* kind of flow control enabled on your system, either hardware
       or software.
 2. Check Your Comm Software For Ansi Printing Capability
    A. After ruling out s/w flow control problems, if printing still
       doesn't work, the odds are that the PC or Mac comm s/w is at fault.
       I don't know how to determine this other than via trial-and-error
       and word-of-mouth.
    B. The "ansiprt" utility included in the pine distribution can also
       be used for testing.  It simply sends the specified text file to
       user's terminal device, bracketed with the ANSI escape sequences
       for print diversion.  This is just what Pine does as well (although
       some versions of ansiprt offer a few options not available via Pine.)
 3. Possible Other Printing Problems
    A. Printing via Pine's "attached-to-ansi" facility to a postscript-only
       printer.  Pine does not yet have the ability to encapsulate text
       into postscript, ala "enscript", so the custom print option using
       enscript and ansiprt will be needed in that case.
    B. Other printer-specific configuration problems.  For example,
       whether or not the printer needs a trailing formfeed to eject the
       last page, or a control-D, or non-Unix newline conventions, etc.
       Many of these problem will also require using the custom print
       command option and "ansiprt".


Hope that helps. BTW, your message looked kinda ugly. Either you're manually
inserting blanks lines or your line width is too high (i.e. exceeding the
recommended 75 characters). Don't :-)

Thanks for your suggestion. We're using EWAN software, emulation vt100.  I
checked the emulation, but didn't realize our tech person reloaded EWAN
from another machine when configuring Microsoft Exchange last night. 
Today the tech reloaded the latest EWAN version from ftp
helpdesk.ccit.arizona.edu and viola, arrows do their thing. Obviously, on
the first EWAN transfer, a file or two got lost.

When I export a message instead of saving it, the technotes imply that I can
still properly read it with pine.  However, pine seems to missinterpret a
message that has been exported as shown if you put this attached sample into a
folder-collection.  It thinks that the from is my address and the subject is
the complete path of the message.  This is an interesting problem because both
elm and mailx handle it correctly.  Furthermore, it decides that the folder is
read-only.  Any ideas what might trigger this?

In older versions of Pine, when you reach the end/top of a page, the 
defaults was to scroll page by page when hitting ^N and ^P. Well, how can 
I change the new versions of Pine to behave that way. I'ld like to use 
the same key when I reach the bottom/top rather than hitting Space and '-'

Thanks again,

Hussam

Subject: Converting PINE address book to Pegasus

Can you advise me about the availablity (and location) of any utility 
to convert my (extensive) Pine Address book into a Pegasus Address 
book?

I've been moved from a UNIX account to an ISP, which doesn't support 
Pine, and would rather not re-type this large address list.

Thanks in advance for your help.

|... Bottom-line: how can I *reliably* find
|out if my mail has reached its destination?

This may sound facetious, or too low-tech for many, but if you really
need to know, the _most_ reliable way is to ask the person to let you
know that they received the mail, by phone if you don't trust mail.

Dear Sir/Madam,
		I am mailing you to ask whether it is possible to alter
the pine system so that it will check for messages more frequently than it
already does. I have just begun using your system and am most impressed,
any help you can offer regarding my query would only heighten my
appreciation for the pine system.
			Yours sincerely,
                                        Patrick Gatland 

                   University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.

Hussam,
Please note that in the Index view, ^P and ^N behavior was changed in
order to provide a *choice*... Use P and N (no control) if you want the
page-at-a-time behavior.

[Yippee!  Someone else is getting this too besides us!]

We are having problems printing from PC-Pine 3.96 under Windows 95 to
networked printers: we _always_ get this error message. 

However it _will_ print to a locally attached inkjet printer OK.

Interestingly PC-Pine 3.92 and 3.95 both happily print to the networked
printers.  I wonder if there's been a problem in the build of 3.96?

Anyway, I submitted this as a bug report (ID KR15U) on March 24, but have
so far to hear anything back.  If I get anything I'll let you know.  (I
may send a reminder now.)

Cheers,

Well, you're not talking to the right people here exactly. But I think that
mailbombs are *real* fun, too!!! So here's what to do:

You'll need a professional to help you with that. The best thing for you to
do is post a message to the following newsgroups :

	news.admin.net-abuse.announce
	news.admin.net-abuse.misc
        alt.2600
	alt.hackers

You see, they are professionals (admin means they're administrators) and
they spend a lot of time with little pranks like email-bombs (hence
"net-abuse"). They'll also tell you exactly how to have much more fun than
with mail-bombing only.

NOTE: Because many people hate those people, many mails and postings are
stopped before they arrive at the newsgroup, so to make sure that you reach
them, you should post more than one message, preferably 10 or even better
20. If you send them fast enough, the bad guys won't be able to stop them.

Hope that helps.

Sincerely,
Robin

I've even had it happen in locally attached inkjets, but it seems to be
more rare.

Hi Barbara:

The easiest way to do this is through the Pico editor in your shell
account (provided with Pine).

At the Pine main menu, press (s)etup and (s)ignature.  This will take you
to a text editor that looks and feels the same as when you're composing
mail.  (Well, it *is* the same editor!  :)

Just use the prompts at the bottom of the screen when you're composing
your signature.  You'll see how easy it is....


Good luck!

Steps to setting up a signature file...

0.  Stop using the ancient 3.91 version of Pine, and upgrade to the
    current version: 3.96.

1.  Start Pine.

2.  At the Main Menu screen give the S (Setup) command.

3.  Give the S (Signature) command.  This will take you into the
    built-in signature editor, where you can place your text.

Note:  General advice is that the first lne of the signature should
consist of exactly three characters:
	"-- "  (ie, - - Space)

Netiquette recommends that you have no more than 4 lines after this one.

(If it is impossible for you to upgrade to and benefir from the current
version of Pine then do the following:

1.  Start Pine.

2.  At the Main Menu screen give the S (Setup) command.

3.  Give the C (Configuration) command.

4.  Look for the "signature-file" variable and note its value (probably
    ".signature" for a UNIX version of Pine).

5.  Exit from the Setup Configuration screen.

6.  Quit out of Pine.

7.  cd to your home directory (if not already there).

8.  Use your favourite editor to create/edit a file of the name you noted.
    Put your signature text into this.  (Remember the initial "-- " line
    described above, etc)
)

Cheers,

Yes, 3:

1.
Goto the correct newsgroup. 
	comp.mail.eudora.mac
Might be ok.

2.
Read before you post. There's a lot of information about mime capable MUAs
at e.g. 
	www.yahoo.com
	
3.
[censored due to popular demand]
How come you aol guys never get it right?

Later,

Hi,

  Sun os has a utility mail tool which has an icon of a mail box and is
  opened whenever there is a mail, the mail tool has many other features
  of an email program but this feature is very useful. But in case of pine
  window running pine has to be kept open to be made aware of an incoming
  mail. Since i am used to working with pine, have many folders in /mail
  directory, i don't like working with mail tool. So its very cumbersome
  to switch over from mail tool to pine to process the incoming mails
  and also the mail tool prompts to quit once the pine is opened
  simultaneously. 

  is there any way that the pine's recognition of incoming mails can be
  redirected to an utility that is merely an indicator of incoming mails,
  or is there any other way?

tia,
Vani

NAME
       asmail - AfterStep Mail
DESCRIPTION
The  asmail  is  a "mail-checker" like xbiff, but with the Afterstep look &
feel. It indicates the status of your mailbox. It can be put in the Wharf,
execute program on incoming mail, execute program on mouse click, show XPM
icon's, show animations and more...

Or this boring one:

NAME
       xbiff - mailbox flag for X
DESCRIPTION
The  xbiff  program  displays a little image of a mailbox. When there is no
mail, the flag on the mailbox is down. When mail arrives, the flag goes up
and the mailbox beeps. By default, pressing any mouse button in the image
forces xbiff to remember the current size of the mail file as being the
`empty' size and to lower the flag.

Hope that helps.

Dear John:

I'm a recent WebTv purchaser.  As you may know, WebTv operates through
your TV, through a Sony box in my particular case.  At this point, WebTv
does not offer print-out  capability, although they are working on an
upgrade to provide that.  The signal from the Sony box to the TV travels
through an S-Video cable.  I have very little sophistication in these
matters, but it has occurred to me that if the S-Video signal could be
sent into my old MacSE, possibly through an adaptation of the modem
port, I could get print-out capabilities right now for very little
money.  Is such a thing possible?   Is this an appropriate question for
you?  If not, do you know who I might direct it to?

Thanks for your help.

David

I cannot find this topic addressed in the FAQs or in the Info archive.

In dividing system load between two or more servers, we can tell users to
change their PC and Mac client software from <server>.<domain.name> to
mail.<domain.name> to access their mail.  Can pine be configured so that a
login (with shell access on one server) can access mail which is routed to
a separate mail server (where that login is not allowed shell access)?
Using a .forward file on the mail server for each pine user login defeats
the the purpose of sending the mail load to the separate server.  If this
is possible, what are the setup differences between Solaris and IRIX? 

Thanks

Help: I can't seem to get rid of files attached to e-mail messages sent to
me. When I start an FTP session in the mainframe on which my account is
located, I type ls to get a list of the files attached to e-mail messages
then i try typing DELE so that I can delete files in that I have
saved to my Macintosh desktop. But I get a message that DELE is an invalid
command. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks.

Hello --

I should have added that your recipient MUST also have PINE which
is free and available at various addresses listed in the FAQ.

I apologize for the omission.

1. You have your reply to: set to an invalid value.

2. "Microsoft Internet Mail 4.70.1157" You're in the *entirely* wrong
   newsgroup.

3. Your problem has nothing to do with email, but with internet protocols.


Possible solutions:

Read the extensive, colourful and userfriendly help that comes with
Microsoft Internet Mail 4.70.1157.

Post to:
microsoft.public.internet.mail
microsoft.public.mail.connectivity
microsoft.public.money
alt.os.toys

Btw, one of the possible solutions to your problem would be to talk to the
people at your university's help desk. You'll need their "internet startup
kit", anyway, unless you want to write login scripts etc. manually.

Later,
Robin

Could someone please help me correct my time zone info on Pine e-mails?

I tried editing the autoexec.bat (per instructions I saw on another 
list) to:  SET TZ=AST 

[I'm in the Atlantic Time Zone (AST), which should also be -0400]

On one of my computers (this one, running WIN 95 and PC-PINE 3.91), this 
edit had no effect whatsoever (see above).

On another computer (running Windows 3.something and PC-PINE) it changed 
it to -0100 (AST) -- in other words, the zone is correct, but the 
differential from GMT is not.

TIA
Sara

Hi!

I've read the postings on the pop features of pine, and I had one
Question before trying it out.

Could it erase (chunk?) the mail I hold in my INBOX, or could I be
able to read both the mail send to my primary Adress and the mail sent
to the account I will connect thru the pop server at the same time?

Yet ther is another question, where am I supposed to fill in my
password on thr remote system?

Thanks so much (on advanced)!

Eduardo

You've entered the Dos95 Twilight Zone *didadidadaaa* :-)

There's a kewl user-friendly icon on your right mouse button on the start
icon in the task bar. It should say something like system settings (sorry,
never ran away from an English Windos), and there's something you can set
the timezone and stuff with. It's got a colourful clock and there's a globe,
too... You need to set something in each...

\me sings: "That's entertainment..."

Later,
Robin

Has anyone seen this error and if so, do you have any suggestions as to
what is causing this.....

:
Sorry, problem detected.  Can't write index cache block in from disk.
Very sorry, pine will now crash.  Please report this.

We are running PC pine.  The user is running WinDD from Tektronix on a Tek

First, appoligies if this is a worn out or frequently asked question,
but I was wondering if anyone has talked about a version of pine (or if
another e-mail reader exists) that runs in a Windows95 or Windows NT
command prompt, yet uses winsock for it's communications.  What I am
trying to do is to allow people who already telneting into a Windows NT
server to use a text based client to read pop e-mail.  Anyone ever heard
of this?

	IMHO the pc-pine version is kind of silly in the fact that it continues
to implement the program as text based, yet it's in a window.  They
should have left it strictly text so you could and run it at a command
prompt.

Putting the following in my AUTOEXEC.BAT works for me in both
Win3.x and Win95:

During daylight savings time I use this:

 SET TZ=EST5EDT


And during standard time I use this:

 SET TZ=EST5

Don't forget to reboot your machine after editing your
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  BTW, does anyone know of a web page that contains a
list of all the timezones (EST, PST, etc.) and their offsets (5, 8,
etc.)?

Thanks,
Nancy

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,

I loaded the new version of Pine3.96, and am unable to communicate to
the nntp server. I have the nntp server name set right in the
.pinerc file.

I want pine to prompt me for User id and Password when accessing the
nntp server.

I get the "450 Authentication required for command. Telnet to Port 1119
of <nntp server>" at the bottom of the pine screen.

I read about the AUTHINFO but do not know how to activate or configure.

Any help will be appreciated.

Pine 3.96 supports AUTHINFO automatically, but it is possible that
your server is using a different mechanism for authentication.  Please
ask your news server administrator for further information.

Windows 3.1 doesn't support CLI apps using winsock at all.  The support in
Win95 is a pain.  (Look at Quake.)  If somebody released a free version of
the type of technology used in Quake I can think of lots of applications
for it.

I am using Pine 3.96 and get an error message saying .addressbook.lu is
invalid each time I perform an operation that involves my addressbook.  I
have deleted this file and asked Pine to reconstruct it with the same
results.  Below is the output from Pine as placed in the debug file.  Any
suggestions on how to correct this problem would be appreciated.

Yes, but Win32 has a charactermode (Lynx for Win32 uses this). A Pine for
that would be nice. The DOS version of Pine cannot access the Winsock
driver, and is limited to DOS' 640 Kbyte barrier, a textmode Win32 program
would not be limited in such a way.

Rading this and Vikas followup I checked upon the header of your post again:

	X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.2 PL2]
	Message-ID: <E8LCJ2.BBK@eskimo.com>
	References: <Pine.OSF.3.91.970412000047.24576A-200000@copper.ucs.indiana.edu>

Guess I must have seen the Pine id in the References: while I was editing my
followup instead of looking at the Message-ID of your post.
Yes, you are obviously not using Pine, but tin.
I stand corrected.  Apologies!

But I still don't like that nospam address attitude.  ;-)

Any info if the next generation of PC-Pine has a newsreader
that could access any NNTP site, I have problems with this
just now. As a bonus, if one could share the .newsrc file
with a local and remote place, that would be really neat.

I really like the idea of a combined news and email reader,
as that's one less window on my desktop, and ultimately
news and email is nearly the same, anyway.

Thx, Kent

Subject: Autoadding "-- " before the signature
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

There were talks about making Pine autoadd "-- " and a newline before the
signature file (as defined in some RFC). I've succesfully (at least the
program hasn't bombed yet) patched my copy, by adding this:

        strcat(sig, "-- ");
        strcat(sig, NEWLINE);

at line 2540 of reply.c. That is, after

    if(tmp_sig = read_file(sig_path)){
        sig = fs_get(strlen(tmp_sig) + 10);
        strcpy(sig, NEWLINE);
        strcat(sig, NEWLINE);

and before

        strcat(sig, tmp_sig);
        fs_give((void **)&tmp_sig);
    }

Does this mean that you included my patch, or that you're doing it your
own way? (Doesn't really matter, only that it gets included).

That just steps to the next message with + anywhere in the index
line but I want to change the index view so it is just displaying
the messages with a + in the leftmost column.  My guess is that
whatever the solution to this is it will involve using the Z
(ZoomMode) command.  

Thanks,

	According to the US centric RFCs the only valid TZs are those
from the USA including their daylight savings time variations.  This,
is not such a bad idea when you consider that SST could be Singapore
Standard Time, Switzerland Standard Time, Sudan Standard Time, etc.
I would say the best thing would be to always set your TZ to an offset
from GMT....which you can figure out by consulting your nearest Almanac.

Robin:  

I am having similar troubles...running PC-Pine w/ WinNT4.0.  Making
the setting changes you describe from the "Control Panel", in my case,
allows the time to have the correct hour, but always with the designation:
"PST" or "PDT"...I am in the "EST" or "EDT" time zone.  Since the time is
correct, things can function.  With the zone trouble, people are sometimes
confused.

Knowing that the Pine folks are in the Pacific Time Zone, I can understand
the zone "choice", but would like to correct it.  (Further, I realize it
must be a setting of some kind, since some, but not all, of my users
experience this trouble.)

Any help appreciated.

Well, thats exactly what I set out to find. I am hearing that the current
state-of-the art of the Internet technology is such that this cannot be
reliably done. Fine.

Well, I wasnt aware of it either until I saw someone post otherwise in this
thread. See <33538229.1567065@news.sci.fi>  I havent had time to check it out
yet.

Thanks and regards,
Vikas

Just out of curiosity, what is the percentage of mails that get arbitrarily
'dropped' without any notification at all to the sender? Due to whatever
reason? Has anyone ever done any studies/surveys on the "reliability" of email
as a form of communication as it stands today?

Robin et al. --

Like Catherine, I made the correct settings in Settings/Control 
Panel/Date&Time to no avail -- THEN I tried the autoexec.bat edit.  
Neither has any effect.

Well, I think you'd best check the MS newsgroups for that :-)

As an alternative, you might consider moving to Germany. It's a friendly
little country with only one timezone.

Or, you could drop that MS-toy and install an OS that deserves its name. Any
u*ix (probably not HP, because it sucks) will let you set that easily .-)

A nice weekend to all,
Robin

Ok, since you didn't give *any* information about your system, the safest
thing for you to do is get the pine docu:

	http://www.washington.edu/pine

There is an extensive passage about printing problems.

It might be a little off topic, but the safest way to make sure that a mail
has reached its destination is to use an auto-acknowledgement system. I've
set up procmail in a way that you can send a mail with "en/disable auto
acknowledgement" and that's that. All you need to do is make sure the other
side has the same, but as this measure is only necessary for a few people,
that's not a big deal, either.

There are some nifty reciped in the "procmail library" by Alan Stebbens:

Since the time zone function fine for the OS and for other applications, I
do not believe this will produce musch of a result.  I will, however, see
if there are any helpful suggestions in that group.

The problem is not setting the TZ within the OS.  That was successful.
The probelm is that PC-Pine does not recognize the TZ setting from the OS.
Perhaps, since you are running unix pine, you have not experienced this
trouble.

Hi,

In the pine-info archives I noticed a question that was over a year old 
asking about printing messages from Microsoft Mail. Since MS Mail doesn't 
add carraige returns the messages print just one line per paragraph and
the rest just runs off of the page. Does anyone
know of a fix for this or if something in pine can be
set to remedy it.

Please respond by e-mail.

Thanks a lot,

Dave Weiss

It is my understanding that students email accounts are affected when we 
change student numbers; as such I would like to request that that you make
the appropriate changes to your files to insure that the following student
has email access.

Student's name: Satu Sofia Stechschulte
Old or incorrect Student number: 9527886
Correct Student number: 9135868 
  
Please let me know if you want to be notified every time we make a student
number change and what is the best way to handle it to avoid email service
interruption for the student.

	Thank you.

I believe that this is a HOAX message.  I recommend verifying the 
authenticity of messages such as this BEFORE passing them on to the

Another important issue is one which the *&$%%$#@@!$% spammers have
unfortunately tarnished.

I move around a lot and over the years since 1976 I have had a number
of different computer accounts that I sent mail & news etc. out from.

A couple of years ago I got sick of always having to try and let
everyone know when my email address was going to change, and I signed
up with "pobox.com" for their portable email forwarding service.

Now I always want you to see "ckk@pobox.com" in whatever headers that
your mail program is going to use to reply to me. Any other address in
any other header may be valid at the moment but not in a few years; or
i may be unreachable behind a firewall; or it may be on a hostname
which we've just decommissioned; or it may be, as someone mentioned
here, related to an IMAP mailbox, and not useful as a reply address.

Even if a piece of mail from me sits around in an archive for years, I
still want you to be able to reply to me. There are messages from me
back in the 1980's, archived at Web sites, and people have
occasionally written to me at those old addresses. Fortunately they're
still alive & forwarding to me now. But what about the next ten years?

So I want to make sure that I can say "Reply-To: ckk@pobox.com" on
everything I post or mail, regardless of where it is actually coming
from. And it literally could be coming from any one of hundreds of
different systems where I could legitimately be mailing from, across a
number of different organizations and networks, across the USA.

I'd like to change the "From:" header too if possible, and even the
RFC 821 envelope sender (MAIL FROM field), all to my portable
ckk@pobox.com moniker. I may be using Pine on timesharing host A.B.C
today, but it's only one of a zillion places I may be mailing &
posting from and I want those archived messages to only show the
permanent address for me, so they're not garbage in another ten
years!!! And of course as a long time sysadmin and Postmaster, I set
up Pine myself on systems and disabled "allow-changing-From-line" too,
even though I want it on for myself!!! (am I a hypocrite? :-)

(of course as a side consequence, I want to kill, kill, smash, stomp,
stomp, the author of the decision which made Microsoft Mail SMTP
Gateways ignore Reply-To: and From: headers, and only show the
envelope sender (RFC 821 MAIL FROM field) to the user of the MS-Mail
Postoffice mailbox. At least they've fixed this with Microsoft
Exchange Server's Internet Mail Service!!! Thank you!!!! And VAX/VMS
3rd party Smtp products used to do the same thing, cc:Mail and
Quickmail gateways too, etc. Kill, smash, stomp them all!)

Now back to the @(*^*^%!)(*%^#& spammers.

I have a legitimate reason for wanting to put something into the
replyable headers you see in mail from me, something which has no
syntactical or semantic connection to any of the actual accounts,
hosts, etc. that I actually use for my mailing & news posting.

But those @$#@!_)&&^%$%&^$ spammers are pushing things to where it'll
be harder and harder to do this, because they're abusing it.

Recommendations will be enforced soon, by outgoing anti-spam filters
on ISP firewalls, where PPP dialups may no longer be able to send out
MAIL FROM an address that doesn't relate to the network they're
on. I'll have to get some kind of special permission, register
specially somehow, in order to keep being "ckk@pobox.com" no matter
what ISP PPP I happen to be using today. (i.e. somehow I'll have to
register an association, between my pobox.com permanent moniker and
whatever authentication I use for this particular ISP, and they'll
have to store it and check my mail against it on their firewall's
outgoing mail queues, to make sure I'm not a &*%%#@*^&^$^Y spammer).

Some of you might know what a fanatical anti-spam vigilante I am, so
here I know that my own needs conflict with the need for controlling
those I^&^$&^%*&^ spammers.

Well, it's not just Mark... it's the way a LOT of systems have done things.
Even Berkeley, and I know Mark isn't too fond of them from his comments
in the c-client library. :)

You almost always want to junk your vendor provided sendmail.  Solaris, for
example, ships with a mystery version of sendmail that has weird god-awful
hacks in it so that it can run with the same config file originally written
in 1937 or so.  If you use your own compilation you can at least know what
it is and keep it current easily.

Procmail is a wonderful choice for a delivery agent.  It is VERY paranoid
and behaves itself better than most programs, which is perhaps what's
confusing you about the BOGUS files.  If you don't mail the user, procmail
won't create ANY file at all.  But if it finds one and it's not owned by
the proper user, it's renamed.  This is so you can't have userbob put in
a fake mail file for userjohn if John has a broken client that erases his
mailbox when he cleans it.

If procmail didn't move it out of the way, you'd run into other issues, like
who should own the file, should procmail still have root at that point to
chown the file, etc.

Steven seems to have done a lot of thought on that and I'm comfortable with
its handling and how early procmail gives up root.

Ah, the world of Unix file lockings... :)  Try procmail -v and it'll tell
you what file locking it wants to do.  If installed right, it will do every
kind of file locking it can... dotlocks, fcntl, lockf and flock, hoping that
your clients will use one of them.

Clients compiled with the c-client library (which includes pine, imapd and
ipop3d) will do various types of locks as well (a quick check shows flock,
dotlock, and others.... The lock with the digits/etc are temporary locks
on the way to being a dotlock.  Look at bezerk_lock() in c-client/bezerk.c
for the details. :)

Yes, they seem to work fine together.

Paranoia is good.  So is violence.  But I use procmail and imapd and ipop3d
here and have no problems with them locking.  The only problem is people
using broken clients that open the pop mailbox twice, but Mark's method on
that works better on IE2.0 which could do the same thing, and since most
of our customers are using IE in some flavor, that's fine by me.

  As somebody else said, use Bcc:
  Even better, use Lcc:

  You can get help on each by invoking the ^R rich header, positioning

No, the recipient merely needs to use any mail program.

However, if Attach is used, the recipient's program must be MIME
compatible.

Hi -


Does anyone know if it is possible in pine 3.95 to select multiple mime
attachments at once without having to do each one individually?  The ";"
doesn't seem to work when viewing files to attach (^T), nor can we use
wildcards.  This would be a big time saver.


Thx for any leads,


C.

Alas, not yet (and probably not in 4.0)...  but you are not the

Hi,

I got a message apparently composed with Pine having the Cont-Type set to
text/enriched. Does somebody know how one can do that ?

By the way, I'd like to know what are the features of enriched text. Any
help ?

Best regards,

Jean

PS could you send reply both in the newsgroup and directly to my e-mail

Sure, XEmacs 19.15 can do it... It's a killer program and gnus is the best
mailing program I've ever seen (if it weren't for the 160MB you need for the
installation).

I don't think you get it any better than + anywhere in the index.

    Unfortunately you did not give details of your setup, which would
have been a big, big help.  (Many inquirers on this newsgroup
frequently fail to provide adequate technical data.)

    However, I can guess at this:

1)  Compose your message offline;
2)  Upload (move) it to whatever system you use Pine from;
3)  Logon to that system;
4)  Make sure that the server Pine talks to is itself "online";
5)  Start Pine;
6)  Compose your message in Pine, reading in the uploaded message;
7)  Post the message as normally.

However you compose the message, it must be read in (or attached) to
Pine, which itself must be able to talk to a server itself in some
sense "online."  You cannot merely compose a message in a system which
is not connected to the Internet somehow and expect your message to go
anywhere.  However, as you did not provide technical details, it's a
little like shooting at bats in a cave.

I just tried to do `W + ^X Z' and when I did ^X, pine produced this
message:

 [Command "^X" not defined for this screen. Use ? for help]

Did you really get this to zoom in on all the + messages?  If so,
could you give exact instructions of what you did?

I agree completely that the definitions you give above are the way it
_should_ work.  Unfortunately there are several problems to consider:

1.  Making the Sender: header non-editable implies that the client
needs some way to authenticate that header.  PC-Pine gets that
information from the IMAP credentials used to open the INBOX.  In some
cases the address generated from the IMAP login does not correspond
directly to a deliverable e-mail address.  [Chris Newman was
circulating a proposal to define a new header with authentication
information, but I don't know what its status is.]

2.  Many clients do not display the Sender: or X-Sender: header by
default.  Thus, simply changing the From: header on-the-fly makes it
possible to fool a naieve user into believing a forged e-mail. 

3.  If I remember correctly, when custom header support was first
added to Pine, the From: header was editable.  Overwhelming demand
from mail administrators made us change the default to disable editing
the From: header, largely because of (2).

4.  Some commonly used mailing list management software makes
assumptions about these headers that conflict with our assumptions.
That was a driving force in making Pine default to use X-Sender:
instead of Sender:.  From recent reports, that software is even
looking at X-Sender: now :-(

With the changing face of e-mail usage and products, it is possible
that we could be persuaded to change Pine's defaults.  But, the above
problems do need to be addressed by any changes we make...

I installed qmail on my not-connected machine [that's why you
haven't seen my success note, Dan] about a week ago. While
waiting for the ugly makefile to finish its work I read
Bernstein's thoughts included in the distribution. From what I
read, I conclude that DSN won't be supported for a while by
qmail. A shame...

We have situation where users use an imap server based on their loginid.  
I gather University of Washington has something similar.  I would like to 
get input on how to handle labs where the userid is going to change

Subject: Feature Request, Delete Multiple Messages with One Keystroke
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I know you can use the aggregate commands to delete messages that meet
assorted criteria.  However I'd find it handy when sorting messages by
subject to have the ability to mark all messages with a given subject as
deleted with just one keystroke.  Perhaps it could be an option that would
be enabled in the configuration menus and then when the index is pointing
to a given message pressing some key would automatically mark that message
and any with the same subject as deleted.  This would be similar to the
mark thread deleted or read feature in most news readers.

If there's already a way to do this please let me know.

I'm sorry, it was my mistake to use a form of words that suggested I was
referring specifically to the return-receipt-to header. 

What I had meant to say was, I wasn't aware that _any_ mechanism of mail
confirmation was mandatory, on the Internet.

Please accept my apologies for creating unintended confusion.

I had a similar problem with 3.95. I moved my .pinerc and let Pine
create a new one. It quit hanging, became fast again. Slowly I added
each feature that had been in my older rc file, and the hanging did
not return. I can only assume that the older rc file was corrupted. I
wish I had not set debug level to 0, or I would have had backup rc.

You should realize that IMAP is not a shell process, therefore ssh has 
nothing to do with it.  To employ encryption schemes in Pine, the IMAP 
server must be hooked to the scheme.  I think Kerbero should be the
answer, and it is probably in the plans of future IMAP, if it is not 
already in operation.

Just my 2c.

In Windows 95, you don't set the timezone with the TZ environment
variable, but rather via its built-in timezone settings, accessible via
the Control Panel.

Interesting to hear that. Nevertheless I use SSH with Pine every day :-)

There are two ways:

- protect your IMAP stream via SSH's port forwarding mechanism.
  
  I did this for several months and it worked fine. You can find my solution in
  the SSH contrib area, e.g. ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/contrib/imap_sec.tgz. 
  
- use SSH instead of rsh to connect to the remote host and start (a so-called
  pre-authenticated) imapd there. This is the way I've been using pine for
  about a week and I would recommend it because login runs faster and you
  aren't asked for a password by pine. Of course, you must be allowed to start
  a shell on the remote host and you must set a reasonable value for
  "rsh-open-timeout" in .pinerc.

  Unfortunately "rsh" is hardcoded into pine. Therefore I modified the C
  sources a bit. Others replaced rsh by a shell script executing "ssh" when
  being called with the argument "/etc/rimapd". /etc/rimapd is the place where
  pine expects the remote imapd. This is a hardcoded string as well.

  To use ssh instead of rsh you can change the Makefile
  (./pine3.96/imap/non-ANSI/c-client/Makefile or
  ./pine3.96/imap/ANSI/c-client/Makefile repectively).

  In my case I used: 

    RSH=ssh
	RSHPATH=/uni/global/bin/ssh

  To be able to change the RSHPATH and the requested service (/etc/rimapd by
  default) via the environment variables PINE_RSH and PINE_RIMAPD without
  recompiling pine I changed the function tcp_aopen() in
  .../c-client/tcp_unix.c:

  #if 0
        if (user && *user)    /* now run it */
      execl (RSHPATH,RSH,hostname,"-l",user,"exec",service,0);
        execl (RSHPATH,RSH,hostname,"exec",service,0);
  #else
      {
        char *prsh_path, *prsh, *primapd;
  
        if (prsh_path = getenv("PINE_RSH"))
        {
          if (prsh = strrchr(prsh_path, '/'))
          {
            prsh++;
          }
          else
          {
            prsh = prsh_path;
          }
        }
        else
        {
          prsh_path = RSHPATH;
          prsh = RSH;
        }
  
        if (!(primapd = getenv("PINE_RIMAPD")))
        {
          primapd = service;
        }
  
        if (user && *user)    /* now run it */
           execlp (prsh_path,prsh,hostname,"-l",user,"exec",primapd,0);
          execlp (prsh_path,prsh,hostname,"exec",primapd,0);
      }
  #endif

  A better way to change these values would be config options in .pinerc
  but the little hack was much easier to accomplish.

Not correct. As shown above you can use SSH absolutely tansparently to imapd.

I don't intend to compare SSH with Kerberos, but Kerberos is not needed in
order to securely access your mail box via IMAP with Pine.

In my case, the timezone seetings have been set, (in WinNT 4.0) and are
accurrate for all applications, except Pine.  It seems that Pine ignores
the tz settings from the control panel.

[Don't you just hate receiving messages where the signature is longer than
the actual text of the message? ;-]

Yep, there is a way of suppressing the recipients' e-mail addresses; the
exact mechanism depends on the version of Pine you are using (it's easier
in 3.93 onwards).

You didn't bother to mention your version of Pine, but from the Message-Id
header of your message I'm presuming it's 3.95.  In which case...

1.  Start composing your message.

2.  Put cursor on any header line.

3.  Type ^R (Rich Headers) to see al the available headers.

4.  Put cursor on the "Lcc:" header and ask Pine for help by typing ^G
    (Get Help).  Repeat for "Bcc:".

5.  Use whichever is appropriate for you.

Cheers,

Hi

We are running the pre-compiled Pine 3.93 for HP-UX 9.* together with
HP's PHNE_8370 'cumulative Sendmail patch'.

We have encountered errors in the BASE64 encoded MIME attachments
when sending a mail through the local Unix machine's Sendmail daemon.
This results is corrupted attachments seen as an irregular pattern 
in the BASE64 -code (some code lines longer than expected).
It is not possible to decode these mail's.

BUT, if the same mail is sent via Sendmail on another HP-UX box 
(identical Sendmail config. & "smtp-server=" activated), the 
transmission is error-free.

In both cases, the encoded mail stored in the 'sent-mail' -folder
looks ok.

Any suggestions ?


Best regards

Lars Hoel

I just thought of a UI that's maybe more clear.  What do you think
of this:

  Text to search for [] :
  ^G Help     ^X Select Msgs Matching Text  ^Y First Msg
  ^C Cancel  Ret Next Msg Matching Text     ^V Last Msg


Reasons this might be more clear:

* "Text" is better than "Word" because some people might
  think that "Word" means you can't include spaces.  ("String"
  would probably be best but lots of people wouldn't understand
  that!)

* Using the word "Msg" in the last four choices helps
  to make it clear what the difference between them is.

* Using the phrase "Matching Text" in the second two makes
  it clear that those two (and only those two) depend on the
  search text.

Just a suggestion!
Nancy

When we try to print to a LaserWriter on an ethernet network all is well
until a message sent by a person using Windows 95 and MS Exchange comes
through.  Then, presumably because Exchange uses no ansi characters (?),
our Macs simply hang forever.  This occurs, we think, irrespective of
the type of Mac (we're using 68040 and PowerPC) Macs, and printing to
various LaserWriters.  Anybody else have the problem?  Any solutions? 
Thanks in advance.  Reply to me or to group.

Can I get a version of PINE to work on my WINNT3.51  O/S PC at home?
This PC is connected to the internet via NETCOM and currently uses
NETSCAPE to access my mail.  Can I use pine to do the same thing?
Also, can PINE accept my saved mail files and address books that were
generated under netscape and netcome protocols?

Thanks.

There was a known problem with lengthy attachments in Pine 3.93, were
timing was a critical issue (the EINTR problem for the knowledgeably
curious). This can also explain why changing the Sendmail server "appears" 
to fix the problem (due to faster/slower transport).

This is in accordance to the bug just mentioned, as are the code lines
that are longer than expected. The data gets corrupted in the loop that
feeds sendmail, so all local copies of the message remain in tact.

> Any suggestions ?

You probably guessed it by now: upgrading to the latest version of Pine
(currently 3.96) should fix your problems.

Hello,

I have recently found that I have need to restrict a user rather hard.
I do want to allow him telnet access .. but just access to pine ..
therefor I would like to put pine as this users shell .. easy .. bu what
if this user tries to open up a subshell?? .. if everything is okey .. he
will open up another version of pine .. but I want to disable the use of
subshells .. even if those are (almost) harmless ..

I would also want him to only be able to send mail to a certain user on
the system .. I could accomplish that by modify the sendit.sh but is there
another way todo it so that the user knows that he can't send mail to
other adresses than just this user .. 

But the rest of the features should be set as usual ..

Could anyone of you help me .. or should I go and UTSL ??


Thanks
/Emil

Does anyone know how to change the reply-to field in pine?

That is, changing the name as well as the domain. (you can change the
domain easily by setting "user-domain")

Is it possible??  Or does it get the user name from the password file...

Thanks,

Victor Cheung

Kelly,
  It appears that the timestamp isn't getting entered into the
.addressbook.lu file correctly for some reason. The timestamp is the first
number on the last like of the .lu file and should be comparable to the
file_mtime number it is being compared to

> lu is out of date: timestamp=48 file_mtime=861301801

If you would, run "pine -d9" and access your address book. Then send the
debug file to me and I'll see what I can see. Thanks.

I searched all the help files, all the manuals... and my question is:

Is the PINE program capable of add a Reply-to: field, as other
mail programs?

Thanks for your help,

Subject: Global Address Book Update Question/Bug?
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

When the contents in the Global Address Book is updated, running pine 3.96
still shows old contents.  If pine is restarted, updated address book
contents are reflected in pine.

Question:
Is there a way to get a running pine session to reload the new global
address book contents?

Research:
Does this affect user address book as well?

Pine info:
Ver 3.96 running on SunOS 4.1.4 2 sun4m.

You shouldn't do this.

The Message ID is not something that is supposed to be pretty; it is
something that is supposed to be unique.  If you use a non-unique name to
the right of the "@", then there is a small, but non-zero, chance that you
will duplicate a name generated by some other machine that happens to have
the same name.

Certain individuals have argued that the RFCs require that the Message-ID
be a fully-qualified domain name that is known to the Domain Name System
and matches the system which generated the message.  There isn't, in fact,
any such requirement (it requires jumping to a lot of conclusions to say
that there is), but it is undeniably the convention to do this.  In other
words, it's an option, but a "mandatory option"...  ;-)

Correct.

No, not really. Quake is a special case, since it runs a Win32 "server"
and a DOS program as "client". You can run Win32 programs directly in
charactermode and access the Winsock, look at Lynx/Win32.

Because Pine has not yet added a feature to read mail/news offline?

I'm sorry if I misunderstood your original post, I just thought that you
hadn't found out how to write news messages at all, except for replying to
other's.

You can add a "Reply-to:" header by using Pine's Setup Configuration
screen, and setting up an appropriate value for the "customized-hdrs"
variable.  For example, I have mine set as follows:

    customized-hdrs  = Reply-to:
                       Followup-to:

which adds two new headers -- Reply-to: and Followup-to: -- to the headers
available for me to use.

If you want to supply a default value for one of them just put it after
the ":".  For example:

    customized-hdrs  = Reply-to: Wonko the Sane <wonko@zob.magicland.edu>
                       Followup-to:

Cheers,

PS...

Normally I would send a my reply direct to you, with a copy to the list at
large.  This ensures you receive it as soon as possible and don't miss it. 
However I see little reason why I should have to fight your forged
"anti-spam" return address in order to help you: especially as you don't
seem to give a valid return address _anywhere_ in your query.

Such endeavours may reduce spam-content to you, but they can also
discourage some people (like myself) from trying to help you as well. 

Just my opinion.

Agreed... but is it really necessary for the Message-Id generated by Pine
to be _quite_ so long?

We're seeing problems with Usenet News, where lengthy conversational
threads have hugely long "References:" lines building up very quickly.
This seems to cause severe problems for some of our other news software
(Tin, for one, doesn't like such long lines).

Cheers,

Well, Pine does start up some rsh:s on this end:

 4855   1 S     0:02 pine
 4857   1 S     0:00 rsh bilbo.mdh.se -l dat95pkn exec /etc/rimapd
 4858   1 S     0:00 rsh bilbo.mdh.se -l dat95pkn exec /etc/rimapd

and it was that rsh that I would like to change to ssh. The sshd doesn't
need a shell, afaik.

This is what happened in imap-4.1.

The particular flaw was one of "function does not check to see if an
argument is ridiculously long".  That particular function, however, exists
in many variants, not all of which are distributed from here.  So, it was
faster/easier to put in the size validity check in front of the function
call than it was to try to fix all versions of the function.

In imap-4.1, that function's interface changed, so there wasn't the same
cost in rewriting/testing it as there was in Pine 3.96 (which was a
maintenance no-new-function release just to get out critical patches).

Hi Zac,

Contrary to what appears to be common belief, this isn't really a problem with
Pine. What it actually means is, (well I'm sure you must have guessed by now),
that you've exceeded you disk quota. Delete files from your alloted space,
until you get back under quota. Best stuff to delete, of course, are large
files you might have ftp'd from various places.

Hope that helps...

Hi, I'm sorry I don't have a 'hey! just {insert simple fix-all command here},
and everything will be right back to normal!'

I wanted to suggest, though, that you contact the system administrators, (or
maybe better to find a help desk or some such), at your site. They'll probably
be better equipped to help you.

Dear Friend,
	           I have the pleasure to introduce myself as an 
Egyptian enjoying to have friends everywhere .
I was born in Alexandria { March 5 , 1952 }
I started writing poems and songs as early as 9 years old.

I was graduated from the medical college in Alex.and then I have my 
postgraduate studies in Psychiatry .
I was lucky enough to study Alternative Medicine In The Far East and 
have degrees in HYPNOTHERAPY which is now for me second to non .
Medicine is my hobby as I have my family company running well.
I will be happy to have you as a friend as I am traveling frequently 
and 
you will be my guest whenever you come to Egypt.

I will be happy to have you as a friend as I am traveling frequently 
and 
you will be my guest whenever you come to Egypt.

I would like to start teaching HYPNOTHERAPY through INTERNET
as a Tool for Relaxation and / or Part Time Career .
Im also considering helping friends to cope with stress through 
INTERNET 

I appreciate your comments on those subjects and I appreciate if you 
circulate that letter among few friends and let me have the feedback.  
    

Wishing you all the best ,I remain ,
Yours Faithfully ,
Ali

Blackout <Blackout@wizlink.net> spammed comp.mail.pine. Since I've been
labeled a 'rogue canceller' by certain parties, I'll try to resist the
impulse to do anything about this, and let you, the reader, take care of
the problem in your own way.


If you'd like to complain about this SPAM, which appeared in many other
newsgroups, here are the contact addresses for the originator and his ISP:

	blackout@wizlink.net
	repstein@WIZNET.NET
	safwat@WIZNET.NET
	rick@wiznet.net


On the subject of e-mail, their mail servers seem to be all back in the
dark ages with Sendmail 8.7.5 (no hint of what version of Pine they run,
if any). The above addresses are the ones I've verified as working, or
the registered names from Internic.

Hi Brenda:

By default, PINE should be saving your sent mail, unless you've told it
not to do so.

To check this out, from the main menu press "L".  You'll get your folder
list.  From there, you also may have to press enter to expand your folder
list.  Either way, you should see folders named "INBOX", "sent-mail",
"saved-messages", and perhaps others.

Arrow or tab over to the "sent-mail" folder and press enter.  In there
*should* be copies of all your mail that you've sent to others.  Navigate
as usual. 

If none of this appears, or is different than stated here, talk to your
system or mail admin, or your school's "help desk" and have them help you
reconfigure your setup and/or folders.  Worst case, feel free to write
back, and we can help you out....

Cheers,


Robert J. Wilshe

Yes, it is just curious that the standards have lagged so far behind
commercial needs and availability, almost as though someone had a
vested interest in keeping standards based mailers from being
suitable for business use.  My current system had an adequate
mechanism for a good 10 years with per-recipient requests in header
lines that are just ignored by other mailers.

Errr, the remote systems are running Ms-windows, msdos, and I think
there is a mac or two somewhere.  I really need to have it done as
the remote client grabs the message via POP or IMAP.

In this situation it only makes sense to generate the notification as
it is picked up from the POP box since the receiver is most likely
to go off-line before anything else happens.  The situation would
be a bit more ambiguous with IMAP but still you know if the client
machine has the message.  Do any POP/IMAP servers know about N-R-U-D-T?

I have a user that is encountering no-op dead stream error messages. I
assume it is the
IMAPd loosing connection or something very similar, but I cannot be
sure.

at first  I thought it was the user of an editor that was taking too
long, but the user
says he does not user an alternate editor.

Suggestions?

	thanks,

hi,


i use a Mac (actually a clone, but the same problem happened on my old
mac). 

i telnet to my ISP and use pine. 

the problem that i run into constantly is that if i reply to a message and
include the original text in the message the message that i type types
over the included message (instead of shifting it down a line when i hit
return the cursor moves into the message. )

i asked everyone at the ISP about this problem but no one had an answer. 

is there any way to fix this ? 

thanks

john

That is really strange... Have you set you Mac Telnet program
properly?

I've used Nifty Telnet for Macintosh and log onto a Unix
box and use Pine all the time w/o problems...

I don't know about your telnet client, but I've seen similar problems on 
dial-ups using Z-term.  In that case, the screen size didn't match the 
default screen size in pine.  With the version of Z-term my user had, 
screen size was set using the adjustment bars.

My first guess is that you are one line off.

Yes, you need to set your terminal window to be 80 x 25. (stretch
the window up to the edge of 81 x 26 and then back off a bit
until you get 80 x 25.... that's a little trick I learned...

I have a problem with my old reliable Packard Bell Laser printer.  Don't
laugh, I've been using this HP2 emulation printer since 1990 with no
problems until now!  Now attached to a new pentium 166 ecp printer port,
I now get an extra page on all printouts with garbage on it one or two
lines.  In log documents it prints extra pages between the pages of the
document.
Hope you can help resolve this problem.

hello,
	I get a message that I'm over my disk quota, and I need to delete
files.  How do I go about doing this?  What happens if I don't do this?
I've gone through all of my folders and I have deleted all the letters
that I don't want to save, but I still get the message.  I don't want to
lose the letters that I have saved, but I do want to delete some of that
overloaded disk space.  Please let me know how to do this.  It says
something about "/u10".  My identification is "srhamagu," and my e-mail
address is srhamagu@uci.edu.  Please help me get rid of this problem, or
tell me who to contact to do so.  Thank you

-Scott Hamaguchi-

Hi

My son is in the 4th grade in Burrillville, Rhode Island and is doing a
school project about the effects of boiling bark and what effect it has on
rusting.  While at elementary school my wife spoke to a biologist and he said
that of all the barks tested ( oak, birch and pine) the pine would have an
effect on the rusting process.  He stated that the pine has a
chemical/charastic in the bark that would probally coat the metal called
"silva."  I've been sufing the net tonight and have found nothing about
"silva."  

Would you kindly point me in the right direction to gain some information
about the effects of silva and pine barks charastics.

Thanks in advance for your help

Rick

after you start the mail program on vms you must
specify the forwarding address like this.

first type set forward
then  type "mx%""name@where-ever"""

You need all the " and the mx%.  Don't 
ask me why.  I just live here.  I usually
use UNIX but have a vms account as well.
I use once in a while.

	I was expecting a rather urgent message when (using Pine 1.91 
under Linux 1.2.13) I got the infamous error:

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.


...and no .pine-crash file was created.  Is there any way this could have 
prevented a new message from getting written to my mail-spool file?

  As I mentioned, it is VERY important that I know, so I would really 
appreciate a reply.  Thanks in advance.  (I already searched the archives 
but found nothing that answers this specific question.)

We have always had a problem with IMAP being very slow via modem.  We have
had the problem with Embla and PC Pine.  Does anyone know of a way to speed
up IMAP via modem?  I'm running IMAPbeta4.1 and AIX 4.2.  Thanks.

You should contact the computing services, (or whatever your school might call
them), department at your school. They probably have some sort of help desk,
staffed by folks who can help with this problem.

Albert, tell your sister that when she chooses to compose a message in
Pine, she'll see in the options at the bottom of the screen a choice to
'Read File' by hitting [ctl]+r. (that's listed in the options as ^R)

Once she hits [ctl]+r, she'll see another option at the bottom of the
screen, [ctl]+t, (listed as ^T) and this option is called 'go to files'.
By doing that, she'll start up Pine's disk browser, 'Pilot', where she
can use the highlight bar to maneuver her way through the directories,
highlight the file she'd like to insert into her text, and hit [enter].

I hope this is what you were looking for.

    Starting from the Main Menu, get into the configuration and please
read the online help.  Sorry to be so blunt, but when all else fails,
have you read the accompanying instructions first?

Is there a simple way I can create an address book that has every user

Greetings,

Recently you answered a message on the pine discussion list for someone
who had a problem with their inbox because they had another Pine session
running and the lockfile prevented write access. Well, I get this message:

[Can't open mailbox lock, access is readonly]

And I am absolutely positive that there is no other pine process running
on the entire system. /var/lock, /var/mail, /var/spool/locks and
/usr/spool/locks (just a symlink anyhow) contain nothing. I killed every
process running under the uid in question (including the shell process),
then logged back in... to no avail. This has me absolutely baffled. 

Please reply via email ONLY as I am not subscribed to the pine-info list.
(or the usenet newsgroup)

I am not sure if this can be done by Pine, but I think you can create 
some work-arounds under Unix.

For example, you can implement a scheme to automatically encrypt the
sent-mail after you quit Pine, and decrypt it before Pine is launched.
You have to keep your secret key secure though.  Any automatic scheme
has some holes  ... :-)

Just my 2c.

Slavery began a few years ago with the ascendancy of the Wintel
platform.  Before Wintel, the world was a happy place.  People used
whatever type of computer they wanted, and were able to use programs
that were small, efficient, and relatively bug free!  It was a happy time.

Happily, though my computer does have an Intel processor, and though
two of the partitions contain MS products (95 & NT), my primary OS is
Solaris, so I don't have to experience slavery that often.

If you're talking about the Justive Department, well, they didn't
quite succeed (or at least not yet - knock on wood).  They gave up
after getting a consent decree that didn't really do anything.  As for
the future, one can only hope

Subject: Pine and POP3: Why so flaky?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello,

I use pine 3.95 over a dialup line to a remote POP3 server.
While pine can see the messages and lets me access them, it
frequently returns "connection broken ... access error" messages.
I have to keep going in and out of pine to read the messags.

Is this a pine problem or a POP3 problem?

Does anybody know how I can improve this situation?

The pine program I use is on a linux system.

Thanks you.

Guru

I go through the long winded and slightly un-fiendly practice of Bcc to
myself, then filtering all my incoming mail through procmail, so that any
mail I send to xyz@wherever.com is saved with all the mail from
xyz@wherever.com.

When you're using an address book, parts of it will already be in memory
and cached. Other parts will already have been read off of the disk and
cached by the operating system's standard I/O system. When pine uses an
entry from the address book that isn't cached it does a simple consistency
check to see that the nickname it is looking for (at a certain offset in
the file) is really at the start of a line. If it isn't, it does the
"resyncing" address book thing. If that happens you will get the updated
contents. Also, whenever you start pine the resyncing happens
automatically, so that explains why restarting pine fixes it.

Here's one thing you could do, though it is very clumsy. It's probably
easier to restart pine. 

Go into the Setup/Config screen and find the addrbook-sort-rule. Change
it with the '*' key. Now exit the config screen and say "No" when it asks
if you want to commit the changes (because you didn't really want to
change the addrbook-sort-rule). If it makes you feel safer, you could
change the sort rule back before exiting. This will cause the new
address book data to be noticed.

> Research:
> Does this affect user address book as well?

Yup, same thing there but it is unusual for your personal address book to
be changed since you would usually be the one who changes it. But if you
changed it externally or with another copy of pine, the same thing happens.

But when I try this for my list "Open Systems" nick=office, I get an
error:
  POSTING ERRORS Result: (USER) unknown user name in "Open Systems: ;"

and then:
  [Posting program /usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem -t returned error]

If I delete the To: line contents, I get similar results except the
unknown user name is the "Undisclosed recipients" default value. 

The list works fine when it is entered on the To: line.  The result prior
to the error looks just like the context sensitive help advertises.

This is a SCO Open Server Enterprise 5.0.2 system using mmdf as the MTA,
if that makes a difference.

    Many people on numerous newsgroups are not enthusiastic about this
attitude.  If you aren't interested in sticking around long enough to
hear an answer, why should anybody take the time to hunt you down? 
These newsgroups are GROUPS, not private message services.  If you want
an answer from a newsgroup, you should at least have the courtesy to
subscribe long enough to wait for a response and not expect regular
participants to be at your personal beck and call.

As far as I know, there is no difference in pine between news and mail 
in this case. So my guess is that your problem is elsewhere:

Many mail transfer agents (those programs that pass on mail after pine 
has delivered a message to them) can be set up to check the 
/etc/passwd or similar file and to rewrite the address they are 
sending from. They do that here at math.ntnu.no, I have noticed.

The reason is that many mail programs, unlike pine, will insert no 
information other than the cryptic username, and so this is really 
intended to be helpful. I suppose it may also sometimes be used as a 
weak anti-forgery measure.

What you could try to do instead is to use a program called 'chfn'.  
(For 'change full name', I believe.) This program will usually allow 
you to change certain information about yourself such as personal 
name. This will affect (more or less) all UNIX programs, not just 
pine.

Pine is first trying "rsh", which can take a while. To disable it, 
change the inbox-path to {imap.server.yourplace.edu:143}inbox

Alternatively, you could enable it properly by allowing rsh access 
from known machines to the rimapd program. That way people don't need 
to use passwords each time they log in to the mail server.

Were running Pine 3.95 on a Sun Sparc 20 and
use it as a client to connect to our IMAP
server which is running Netscape Mail server
on Windows NT 3.51 OS.  Were seeming to have
performance problems.  It's taking 30 seconds
for Pine to connect to the IMAP server.  When
using a POP mail client it connects right away.
It seems to be only on our UNIX system that were
having the problem... Any ideas?

Pine's configuration file (.pinerc) allows you to change your full name
and domain name, but not the 'user@' part of the sender address unless
it is compiled with 'ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM' enabled.

There is another way which doesn't require a recompilation of pine. You can
write your message with Compose, postpone it with Ctrl-O, edit the folder for
postponed messages (in my installation $HOME/Mail/postponed-msgs) and then send
the modified postponed message (via Compose and Ctrl-X).

Pine stores the complete mails with From: and Reply-To: lines in the folder for
postponed mails and reads this info back without further checks when resuming
the composition. So it's easy to modify the addresses with an ASCII editor.

This is masteful and very hackish.  Congratulations on coming up with a
way to handle this.

That said, if anybody has enough time and or energy that they're willing
to actually do this in practice, would you please review Larry Wall's
comments on the virtues of "laziness"?

Honestly, this has been bugging me for a while.  My free software plate is
getting cleared off and I'm going to tackle this (and hopefully the
client/server addressbook stuff) within the next month or so.

I don't think that it is possible to change the Sender header in
any version of Pine (does anyone know if that's true?).  However,
it is possible to change the From header in all versions of Pine.
In PC Pine, edit your the user-id and user-domain in your pinerc.
In Unix Pine, you need to either find a version on your system that
has been compiled with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM or recompile pine
yourself.  Here's the strategy I use at my ISPs:

[1] Ask the sys admins if they will compile pine with
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM.  If the ISP provides virtual domain hosting
then it is likely they will do this.


If [1] fails:  
[2] Post to a local news group at your ISP, e.g., isp.general, and
ask if anyone has a compiled version of pine with
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM that they could make world executable.  This
worked at my best.com account.


If [1] and [2] fail:
[3] Compile pine yourself with ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM and then be a
good citizen and make it world executable and post to isp.general
that it is available for anyone to use.


Good luck,
Nancy

 Could someone tell me how to fake a from header with Pine? My wife
and I share an account (by using an alias for her) and I would love for
her to be able to send mail with her alias in the From: field instead of
the bogus gazer@(made up domain) and Reply-To:her address combination that
I use now. All this does is confuse people as to what her address is. We
are using Pine on a Unix system.
 
 Thanks in advance for ANY suggestions.

Hello, 
  New to this list. Im a junior admin at Kreative, and or pine program
is having some problems.  
Info:
  UNix BSDI box
  Pine 3.91

1. First off- should I upgrade to 3.96??
2. I try to reply to a message and get this error message:
     Bug in Pine detected: Received abort Signal
      exiting pine
    So I look in .pine_crash and the pine program is looking for a file
called pine.conf.fixed and it cant find it. IS there a place that I can
go to get this, or if I upgrade to Pine 3.96 will that have that??

Subject: ":;" magic not working with our sendmail and/or PP software

X-To: Pine Discussion Forum <pine-info@u.washington.edu>

Hi!

Many moons ago we could happily use the magical ":;" feature that Pine
uses when you send a message to (only) recipients listed in the Bcc and/or
Lcc headers.

(For those not in the know it creates a To header of the form
	To: Undisclosed recipients:;
and then lists the recipients in the Bcc header)

However at some time or other we lost the ability.  In particular,
messages are still _delivered_ but the recipient no longer sees the
message as being:

	To: Undisclosed recipients:;

they now see:

	To: york.ac.uk@york.ac.uk
	Original-To: Test.Delivery:;@york.ac.uk
	PP-Warning: Parse error in original version of preceding To line

I confess that I'm not _quite_ certain whether sendmail or PP (the
software used on our central mail hub to rewrite headers and things) is to
blame, or even a combination of the two.

If I try telnet-ing to the SMTP port of our mail server and entering
message data by hand the message is delivered with this header:

	To: Undisclosed.recipients:;@york.ac.uk

If I send it to a slightly different e-mail address (basivally adding
@york.ac.uk to the plain username I used above) it will follow this route:

	1.  Be accepted by sendmail (as above)
	2.  Be passed to our mailhub and the PP software
	3.  PP will rewrite the headers
	4.  The mailhub will pass the message back to sendmail on our mail
	    server
	5.  The mail server delivers the message to the INBOX

I *suspect* that the problem is as follows:

	-  In step 1 above sendmail "qualifies" the
		To: Undisclosed.recipients:;
	   by appending "@york.ac.uk" giving
		To: Undisclosed.recipients:;@york.ac.uk

	-  The PP software doesn't like a recipient of
		Undisclosed.recipients:;@york.ac.uk
	   and rewrites this as
		york.ac.uk
	   and also inserts a line complaining, along with the original
	   syntax.

Can anyone confirm that this seems plausible?

If so, should the "Undisclosed.recipients:;" _not_ be being qualified with
the "@york.ac.uk" (ie, the underlying problem is in our sendmail
configuration)?

Or is it _right_ to qualify it, and the problem is in the PP software not
being prepared/configured to parse the resulting
"Undisclosed.recipients:;@york.ac.uk" notation.

I'm fed up of this problem, having gone round in circles for ages with it.
Can anyone shed any light on it?

Thanks ever so!

Hello,

We've encountered a problem printing messages when using a Win95 computer
to telnet to our mail server.  We have tried QVTNET and the telnet program
provided with Win95, both with the same results:  We press 'y' to print,
answer 'y' to the question, the screen scrolls, and nothing happens.

All of our other clients (DOS, Win 3.1, Mac, Unix) print fine.  We are
currently using Pine 3.95, but have also tried 3.91 with no success.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated as we are planning to convert all of
our computer labs to Win95 in the near future...

I would like to legally change my last name.  Are you knowledgeable 
about how to do that?  I did a search on legal name change on the 
internet and it came up with this.  Do you recommend me searching 
anything else to find more info?  If this is the wrong topic of your 
knowledge, sorry to bother you.  Otherwise, I can be reached via e-mail. 
 Thanks

It is possible !

That was my question too some days ago and, due to answers from several
parts, I have now the solution (for me). 

I have a SLIP connection to the mail and news servers via a telephone
line, which means that I am connected to the net only for the
duration of the telephone call. I have Linux in the computer. 

To compose a news posting offline, you may need to set on the
news-post-without-validation option in the setup's feature-list
(Main | Setup | Config menupoint), otherwise pine will try to 'validate'
your newsgroup recipient, which it can do only being online, of course.

Other useful trick may be to use Ctrl-R when in the message header, thus
getting all the fields there. Previously (before having the above option
set) I never got the 'Newsgrp' field in the (short) header (when offline),
probably because pine didn't find the wanted server...  

After writing the message you can postpone it, and send only when you have
the net connection. At least this is the way I choose.

Many thanks for all who helped me (and us)..

Have fun,

Zsolt

Subject: Pine 3.95 deletes message on HUP
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Hi,

I'm having the problem where, when running MicroEmacs (not pico) under
Pine 3.95/Unix, if I get disconnected and later the session gets
killed, pine DELETES the message that was being composed.

Older version would leave it in /tmp as /tmp/pico.*. Now, Pine attempts
to save it, but just deletes it, which is NOT helpful at all. My one
most damning criteria for a BAD program is one that deliberately
destroys work. Right now, that describes 3.95.

I think this is a particularly nasty bug, but a bug report 2 months
ago has brought NO response.

Is this fixed in 3.96? Is there a work-around (short of makeing a copy
of each message as I'm composing it)? Using PICO is NOT an option,
as it doesn't do multiple buffer editing or macros.

Please e-mail.

I recently encounter problems with my telnet connection..  Everytime that i
bring up the application while I'm running netscape, i get the message that
one of the folders or drivers are missing from the NMLIB.DLL,  I already try
installing windows 95, just to see if i could recover those drivers, but did
not work..  Does anyone, could give me some input on how do I go about in
fixing this problem.    Thank you.

Have you tried re-installing the Netscape program?  Or re-installing the
telnet program?

Strange... I assume that most programs will lose your unsaved work if they
are interrupted or aborted.  This is the default action with an untold
number of programs; there is nothing "deliberate" about it.

In view the exceptions are those programs which deliberately make an
attempt to preserve your data, and that this is a sign of a GOOD program.

However it would perhaps be sensible if Pine, when attempting to rescue
your message with its last dying gasp, left the temporary file in place if
it couldn't rescue its content.  Have you looked at the source code to see
exactly what it does in this situation?

Incidentally, I'm assuming you do actually _have_ something in this
temporary file?  You may not have if you've just been typing in a message
from scratch...

The reason I ask is that Pico (the standalone editor, and also in disguise
as Pine's built-in editor) is the thing which actually attempts to save
your in-memory editing buffer to disk as it dies.  Only if it does this
can Pine then rescue the data from the file and store it as an interrupted
message.

However I believe that MicroEMACS (which we also use here, but as a
standalone editor) does _not_ do this last-gasp save-to-disk of your
editing buffer.  This means that if interrupted it simply loses all the
changes you have made since the file was last saved to disk.

Thus if you are starting a message from scratch, typing it into
MicroEMACS, and are interrupted MicroEMACS will _not_ save your message to
disk.  Instead all that is left there is an empty file.  Pine presumably
tries to rescue the contents of the file but finds it empty; there's not a
lot it can do in that situation!

So if my suppositions and assumptions are right you should be pointing the
finger at MicroEMACS for not last-gasp-saving your file rather than at
Pine for not rescuing it.

If this seems to be the case you might like to look at ASAVE (auto-save) 
mode within MicroEMACS.  This saves your file to disk every N characters
typed (N defaults to 256, but can be changed by altering the $asave
MicroEMACS environment variable):

You may like to try using one of these commands within Pine's
Configuration Screen to invoke MicroEMACS to turn on ASAVE mode (and also
WRAP -- word-wrap -- mode if you wish):

	ue -i\$gmode NNN
or	ue -i\$gmode NNN -i\$asave KKK

where:

* ue should be replaced with whatever command you use to start
  MicroEMACS;

* NNN is either 1 (for WRAP mode only), 128 (for ASAVE mode only) or 129
  (for both WRAP and ASAVE modes);

* KKK is the number of keystrokes after which to automatically save your
  file to disk (only needed if you want to change the value from the
  default of 256).

Note that you may have to experiment with extra levels of "\" quote
characters to get the above commands through the shell Pine uses to invoke
the command.  Perhaps something like this might be needed:

	ue -i\\\$gmode NNN

Also note that once ASAVE mode automatically saves your editing buffer to
disk it will replace the current content of that file: there's no going
back if you change your mind and cancel out of MicroEMACS ... the file
will contain the information stored at the last automatic save.

Cheers,

You could have two pine configuration files and select the appropriate one
using a command line option.

You misunderstand. Pine 3.95 actually DELETES the /tmp/pico.* file
that HAS BEEN saved by MicroEmacs, when receiving a HUP. It also
fails to transfer it to it's dead letter save file. On next
startup it suggests continuing when invoking compose, then says that 
there is nothing to continue.

This, going out of its way to delete a saved file, is EVIL.

Ken.

Hmmm.... using the tests I have done on our Unix systems with its version
of MicroEMACS I still stand by what I said later on in my article.

Are you _sure_ MicroEMACS is saving your work to the temporary file?  It
doesn't on ours... I've just tried using MicroEMACS (standalone, not
confusing things by using it from within Pine) to edit an empty file.  I
then sent it a HUP signal and it did _not_ save my changes to the original
file on disk.

If this is also happening on your system then it is no wonder that Pine
can only rescue an empty file.

Have a try of the following just to convince me and others:

	Login session #1			Login session #2
	----------------			----------------
	touch testfile
	ue testfile
		<type in something>
						kill -HUP pid
						  where pid is the pid of
						  the other session's
						  MicroEMACS process
	cat testfile

Is the result still empty, or has the "something" you typed in been saved
there?

Cheers,

Hi,

When I hit ^X^S, I GUARANTEE you that MicroEmacs saves it's file
to /tmp/pico.$$. Then, HUPPing it's parent process, PINE 3.95,
causes both to die, but not before PINE DELETES the existing,
populated, edited file in /tmp.

You continue to misunderstand. I AM SAVING THE FILE. I type ^X^S every
few keystrokes under MicroEmacs. I am not relying on some auto-save
feature (that doesn't exist on my MicroEmacs 3.12 as far as I know.

PINE 3.95 is evil because it deletes the file when HUPPed, and fails
to copy it first.

To the research people:


  My name is dwight krush, and i work for provincial forest products out 
of prince albert, saskatchewan, canada. we are a sawmilling outfit with 2 
mills, 1 mill in the north, and the other in central sask. we have been 
in production for around 15 years, producing dimensional product. 
recently we expanded to the fence post & rail business. so now our 
initial marketing research begins.  i have found thus far that jack pine 
is a species not favored for in the states. one of the main reasons is 
that jack pine was not a certifiable species, so after talking with the 
AWPA i learn that it is under section C5. The only thing missing was that 
copper naphthenate was not included in jack pine.
   
   I understand that this is a research site.  is there any information 
you could send my way about jack pine, the chemical exclusion, it's use 
in the states, and where jack pine is sold.


       I thank you        Dwight Krush

Pine always shows the full list of subscribed newsgroups?

Pine doesn't do that yet?

If so, I'll add this to the wishlist:

   If the From: line had a 'wrong' email address, such as
   sandvik@sgi.com-NO.SPAM, and it was easy to flip this on
   per need, then most likely we could stop some of the
   spamming. Just now we need to edit the From: field.

It would be easy to remove it by a program as well, e.g an additional
cut would do the job..

Hi folks...

I am using a mailto form on my web pages.  My provider won't allow CGI...
So, I get all my mail via pine on my shell account and when I get the mail
from my form, it arrives as an attachment of type: X-WWW-FORM-URLENCODED

It is still just text, and it would make life SO much easier if I could
view the text in pine instead of having to go into the viewer and save the
attachment.  So, is there any voice of wisdom out there that  can point me
in the right direction?  

Many thanks
Randall

P.S.  Please respond with email to rsh@oro.net  THANKS!

Any chance of those paper cups and string being upgraded to tin cans

    Pine *IS* a "real" email program.  It just has different
characteristics.  Every one does.  A program which had every possible
feature that the human mind can conjure up would be so big that it
would be unusable.  However, you can get a lot of what you are
referring to above by using the alternate editor feature, using a
different editor from Pine's built-in composer, and some editor macros
or configuration.  Having that option is part of Pine's strength.  The
exercise is left to the reader.

Indeed.  If there's a need to mail everyone on the system, then the sysadmin
should provide a mail alias for the purpose.

Well, pine defaults to saving a copy of every, yes every message you send in a folder 
called sent-mail. The location and name of this folder can be set in your .pinerc
file. It can also be set in the configuration options accessible from pine itself.

Hello,

Is there any way I can delete spam in my inbox when 
I log in? I have noticed that the particularly annoying
all appear to have a certain text string in the message 
body, and I have found a parameter called "display-filter"
in the setup. I suppose I could use it to delete the spam
before I read it, but what about when logging in?

I didn't find any "inbox" folder I could check with 
some program. BTW, I know nothing about Perl and the
like, just a little C.

HI all,

I just configured the Pine with PGP as input and output filter. It
works greatly. Here is my question: How can I encrypt my folds, say
"sent-mail"  ? I don't want anyone who break into my account find 
out my mail in mail/.. readable.  I want to encript "sent-mail" and
other folds with my secret key, so that no one but myself can read
the mail.

Is it possible to do it in current PINE 3.96 or need to modify the
code to achieve this ?

So, you're aliasing usernames so that their mail goes to the same
server their home directory is on?

If so, are those same file servers the machines that user's log
directly into? 

If not, you're going to have the same locking problems when your MUA
doesn't lock correctly across NFS when a delivery is occuring, or is
all mail access then via IMAP?

Just curious..

Can you help me? I need to do a college homework paper on "Supposed that you
sit down at a computer or computer terminal and discover that the previous
user did not log off correctly, and you have access to his or her e-mail.
What would you do?"

I need something from the Internet to support the paper I write, whether I
choosoe to agree or disagree. Can you give me any suggestions where I can
find some information?

Thank you in advance.

Well, the first thing I would do, to resend the message, is go into the sent
mail folder, and bring up the desired message, then bounce it to the correct
recipient.

This assumes two things: 1) that your pine set-up saves messages in a local
folder, (the default in Unix pine), and 2) you've enabled the bounce command,
via the (S)etup, (C)onfigure option in the main menu.

Once you get this working, I'm sure you won't want to send mail with Netscape.
If you do, you'll have to direct that question to another newsgroup, like
comp.programs.fat.chunky.slow.inefficient.

This paper is about a moral issue, right?  And for that reason, isn't
anything you write completely a personal decision?  How could you possibly
get support from anyone but yourself?  You don't need support when you
tell someone that you dislike chicken; nor do you need it now.

Besides, this is the wrong place to discuss your topic.  This is a
newsgroup devoted to the e-mail program PINE, not e-mail morality.

This is one of those problems that makes you pull your hair out.

The short explanation:  I am trying to get Procmail to forward email to
certain persons that are on the subject line.

What is happening:  Instead of the mail forwarding out, it is being
placed in a mail folder called "*" and the log file reads:

----------------------------
procmail: Notified comsat: "@8974:/we/home/gweb/Mail/*"
procmail: Skipped "^To.*chris"
procmail: Opening "*"
>From - Sat Apr 26 16:37:31 1997
 Subject: another?
  Folder: *
------------------------------

It appears that it had a problem with the part of the .procmailrc that I
have:

 :0
 * ^To.*chris
 ! champton@voy.net

I have tested over and over and it appears that I have everything
correct -- I don't know what is wrong.  Please assist.

Please email your response to champton@voy.net -- since my email is
screwy.

Not entirely true, I don't believe....

The solution is to run pine in IMAP mode.  Change you inbox and mail
folders in config to be of the form:

	{mailhost.dom.ain}INBOX
	{mailhost.dom.ain}mail/[]

Pine will then connect to imapd which will ignore its own "DO NOT
DELTETE" messages.  Default behaviour is to just read the files
directly.

A sidenote that might be worth mentioning is that pine 3.x only uses
IMAP2, but thankfully IMAP4 is backward compatible.  Nonetheless, it'll
make migration easier.

I can see it now: Business cards with email addresses which look like this:

	Me Myname    http://MyCompany.com/~me
	SysAdmin     me@mycompany.comREMOVE_THIS_YOU_IDIOT
	MyCompany    <stupid quote from my boss>

The good side - this will really prevent idiots from replying to you.
The downside  - this includes your boss.  Think about it.

I was just wondering.....

Is it possible to send an email message to ALL the people at a certain 
domain? Like my address is eplanincav@alpha2.curtin.edu.au. Could I send 
a message that goes to everyone at alpha2.curtin.edu.au??? 

Is there any sort of standard way of doing this, or not?

If you know, please reply in email.....

I would like PC-Pine only to list the newsgroups to which I've subscribed,
rather than every single available newsgroup.  Under UNIX-Pine, this
involves checking the "use-subscriptions" option.  How does one do it
under PC-Pine?  Thanks.

Maybe...do you have the list of usernames for alpha2.curtin.edu.au?  If
the system running this mail server is UNIX-based, and you have an
account on this system, you should be able to get the /etc/passwd
file (which contains the list of usernames, among other things).
Once you have the list of users, you're all set; write a script that
strips out everything but the usernames from the passwd file, then
goes through the list and sends a file (the message you want to send)
to each of them.  For example:

--begin script--
#!/bin/bash

#sends mail to all users on a particular system; run this
#from a home directory that you have write permissions to
#
#edit message.txt and other lines as needed

#extract usernames from passwd file
sed "s/:.*//g" < /etc/passwd > raw_addr_list

#do some editing on username list...get rid of useless users
cat raw_addr_list | grep -v root | grep -v bin | grep -v daemon | \
grep -v adm | grep -v lp | grep -v sync | grep -v shutdown | grep -v halt | \
grep -v mail | grep -v news | grep -v uucp | grep -v operator | \
grep -v games | grep -v man | grep -v postmaster | grep -v nobody | \
grep -v ftp | grep -v guest > addr_list

#send the mail!
for addr in `cat ./addr_list`
do
mail -s "Hello world!" $addr@alpha2.curtin.edu.au < message.txt
sleep 1
done

#let the fun begin
--end script--

>Is there any sort of standard way of doing this, or not?

Depends on how you define standard.  Note that if you do this without
the knowledge of your sysadmin, you're likely to get him pretty ticked
off.  This type of thing shoots the load average on a system through
the roof, and chews up space in the mail spool.  (translation:  DON'T
TRY THIS AT HOME)

Also, note that some sites have mail aliases that automatically send
mail to every account within the domain...much easier than writing a
script like the above.

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

This is a know sendmail problem for versions before 8.7.?, the ':;' feature
has been required by rfc822 since 1982 but sendmail has always messed it up
in normal configurations.

Doesn't this give you a nice warm feeling about the reliability of sendmail.

The address "sonething:;@york.ac.uk" is NOT rfc822 compliant. PP is quite
within rights to complain about it; the conversion to 'york.ac.uk' is VERY
dubious though. IMO MTAs should not rewrite the headers unless
  1) They really, really have to.
  2) The mail address they generate is fully RFC822 compliant including both
     user and a fqdn host id.

Subject: Multiple NNTP-servers?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I'm using version 3.96 of Pine (on a SPARC/Solaris2.5) and I've
the followin question/problem:

Is it possible to configure Pine in a way that it's able to support
one news-folder for a distant NNTP-server (containing the ordinary
USENET groups) and another news-collection for our local NNTP-server
(containing jobb-related groups). I've no problem to define those
two groups and read messages, using the following configuration
for "news-collections":

	*{local_nntp_server.company.se/nntp}[company_local.*]
	*{usenet_nntp_server.some_place.se/nntp}[comp.*]

It's however impossible (for me) to reply to a message, from the
currently selected collection. I've tried to define both or none
of the two NNTP-servers for "nntp-server", without any success.
Do I have to reconfigure Pine (parameter: nntp-server) each time
I change news-collection, or is there a better way?

It would also be nice (for me) to have an individual ".newsrc"
for each collection, but I haven't find support for that either.

Thank you and good bye!

One hell of a lot fewer than in late 1990.

Your article has nothing to do with the topic of this mailing list (or
newsgroup, depending on how you're reading it).  Post it somewhere else.

If you happen be talking about these commands shown on the screen:

  ^G Get Help  ^O WriteOut  ^R Read File ^Y Prev Pg   ^K Cut Text  ^C Cur Pos
  ^X Exit      ^J Justify   ^W Where is  ^V Next Pg   ^U UnCut Text^T To Spell

Well, they are part of the editor pico.  Remove pico -> remove commands.  See?

Use pico again!

Subject: Cursor should jump into To-field (3.94)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,

I try to customize Pine's Header. Each time I press C to compose mail
Reply-To appears on the first line and the Cursor jumps into it. This does
not depend where I put Reply-to in the default-composer-headers. However,
usually I need the Cursor starting in the To-field.

1. How can I make the Cursor jumping directly into the To-field after
pressing C ?

2. Is it possible to change the sequence of the Header lines?

In which case, he's in dire need of some training, or a good admin book.
Plus a Bible, so he can pray every night that nothing nasty happens to
his system until he learns how to manage it properly.

    Sorry, but you are not asking in the proper place.  The newsgroups
you posted on are not particularly about procmail.  Did you know that
there is a mailing list dedicated exclusively to procmail?  The address
for subscriptions is

        procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de

    No, but don't despair.  What you want involves the mail delivery
process.  Pine doesn't have anything to do with that.  Pine is a mail
*reader*, taking what the delivery process gives it.  So you need
something that hooks into the mail *delivery* process.  If you have a
WWW browser, browse my home page and follow the link to Nancy McGough's
pages.  A few links in she has a lot of good information on mail
filtering.

Is there a way to configure Pine so that all messages with for example the

Andreas:

I believe what you mention here is a signature at the bottom of your
letter (for example, mine below).  From Pine's main menu, press (S)etup,
and (S)ignature. This will call up Pico, Pine's text editor, and you can
create your signature from there.  You'll notice that the same commands
you use to edit mail are also present in Pico, so you should have no
problem. 

Hope this helps!

I think it does make a difference that it is SCO running mmdf. Because
mmdf's emulation of sendmail does not handle the -bs flag correctly, the
default pine sending method on SCO is to use the sendmail -t method
instead of the sendmail -bs method. There is (what I consider to be) a bug
in sendmail -t which causes it to fail if the To line has a group syntax
address with no actual addresses specified. This bug is apparently
faithfully reproduced in the mmdf emulation of sendmail. This means that
there is no way to use the sendmail -t method of submission and also have
a To header with an empty group syntax address on it, which is what Lcc
and Bcc try to do on SCO systems.

There are some work-arounds. The easiest is if you can set the smtp-server
configuration variable in pine to something. It should certainly work if
you can set it to the name of a close by smtp server, and I think it will
also work if you set it to "localhost". 

You could set "empty-header-message" to "" (two quotes). Then the empty
group syntax address won't be produced at all, so you'll have no To line. 

You could use bcc and put some real address on the To line, like your own
address. 

You could add a hack to your sendmail.cf file that fixes the "bug" by
noticing the empty group syntax address and sending it to /dev/null. I
don't know how to do this with mmdf, but you could add something like the
following in sendmail.cf: 

# Dispose of empty group lists.  There needs to be an alias
# "nobody: /dev/null" in the aliases file.  The idea behind this is to
# allow (empty) list syntax to be used in a header and have it "work" with
# sendmail -t.  That is, it passes through unchanged and unused.
R$*:;                   $#local$:nobody         group syntax hack

This would usually come right before the last line of ruleset 0, which
disposes of local mail.  The idea is that it actually delivers it but to

Me again. The recompile option is out... I ain't got enough space to keep
my own copy of Pine. The thing that works is that postpone message change
in outside editor and resume hack. However, I would like to make this easy
for my wife. She wouldn't like spending that much time just to send a
simple message. 

What I have thought about is using the sending-filter feature and coming
up with a filter to change it automatically  (I already have things set up
so that she has her own config file for Pine)
Anybody got any help on making a filter like that... I have no idea where
to even start.

I know the problem.  The way we do it is to have a special mail address
and use the laias file to redirect the URL_encoded text thrugh a program
that converts the text to readable format.  The mail is then mailed to the
real receiver.

Apart from that; would it be so difficult for the web host managers to 
make a standard mailer CGI script that would work for most people.  It is
certainly a much better solution that the mailto form.  Also, you have
the problem that not all browsers can handle the mailto method in a form.
They just bring up the mail program where the user can make a normal mail 
message, and the forms contents is ignored.

Not in your version of Pine. In the current version (3.96) you can 
alternatively press ESC ESC x.

Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. :-)

If you can't upgrade (or even if you can), look around in your 
terminal program (what is a Psion 3a?) and see what ^x is used for and 
if you can turn it off.

Indeed this has started happening ... so I've changed my scheme. The from
address on this message is only valid for just over a week; most spammers
seem to take 2-3 weeks on average to collect and use an address.

I just underwent a little change at my ISP, and now something's different
in pine.
When I go to reply to a message, I get asked whether I want to
reply to all recipients. Now this would normally happen if the message had
been sent to someone other than me, but now it's happening ALL the time --
even when there are no other recipients, cc:s, bcc:s, etc. Is there any
way to turn this off? If I say "yes" then a copy comes to me; if I say no,
then the reply just goes to the person who sent the original e-mail.

This is pine 3.96.

Thanks,
Joey

My guess is that your email address has changed slightly (it certainly 
looks like a spam block above), so that pine no longer recognizes 
messages sent to the old address as yours.

To fix the problem, go to Setup/Config/alt-addresses and add the 
version(s) of your address that is different from your default.

Greetings,
rjan.

Well, it isn't 'simple' but it can be done.  Now it sounds to me as if
your making either a bomb or a spam sandwich.  Now why do you want to send
a message to every user on your system?

I've got a couple of Unix accounts that use Pine, and I know about the
.forward and .reply files being able to auto-forward/reply to incoming
e-mail messages.  

Well, I spend quite a bit of time on the road, and now I have a wireless
e-mail system.  What I'd like to do is have one of my Pine accounts
automatically Carbon-Copy me on all incoming mail.  What would I do for
that?  .COPY, .CarbonCopy, .CCopy....  

A Public & Private response would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

    That is correct.  At the present time, Pine does not do any mail or
newsgroup filtering.  However, I am told that it is possible to use the
elm filter independently and filter incoming mail before Pine reads it.

This is (fwd) because of a list error trapping mis-fire.

Add a line to your pinerc:

sendmail-path=/usr/local/bin/from_smash

Remove any 'smtp-server=' line.

In the script 'from_smash' put this script (based on pine's 'sendit.sh')

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
#!/bin/sh -
POSTFILE=/tmp/send$$
POSTTOOL=/usr/lib/sendmail
POSTARGS="-oi -oem -t"

umask 077
trap "rm -f ${POSTFILE}; exit 0" 0 1 2 13 15

formail -f -IFrom: "-AFrom: $MAILFROM" > ${POSTFILE}
${POSTTOOL} ${POSTARGS} < ${POSTFILE} & 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Set the environment variable MAILFROM.

The command 'formail' might not be in your unix, it comes from the
procmail package, but in this instance it could probably be replaced
by a shell script.

Hi, 
I am using Pine 3.96 on a Sun with Sun OS, and there seems to be a small
bug that getting the first 100 messages from a remote news server is fine, but
>100 messages takes about 2 seconds per line in the Index screen.
If you then go back to the List screen and reenter the news group the same
problem, >100 news messages take ages to scroll through.
This has only happened in 3.96. (3.95 and 3.94 were both fine).

Anyone got any suggestions
please reply by email as well

Cheers Ian

I need kill file ability in pine badly, this damn cyberpromo

Can I do a kill file in pine?
I have 3.95 pine, the help in it doesn't mention kill files.

Joseph Davidson has a web-based service that will do this, as well as many 
other address book conversions, at <http://www.interguru.com/mailconv.htm>.  

Eudora's address book structure is based upon the alias entries in a Unix 
mailrc file, but it is much more liberal in the formats that it accepts.  
In my experience Joseph's scripts don't cover all the possiblities that 
Eudora allows, so you may need to tinker with the file some after running it 
through his program.

For the first time, I have noticed a problem saving an attachment to a
file in PC-Pine. I have version 3.96. I have not noticed this problem
previously.

When I am in the Viewer and give the Save command, the document I wish to
save comes up in the Save To line but: 

1: I cannot use the ^T function to Go To Files: the keystroke makes
_something_ happen, but whatever it is halts very quickly and loops back
to where I was, and then everything freezes. I have to press ^C to get
out. 

2: After the freeze, I cannot type in an alternative path name. But if I
select "Use Dialog Boxes", I can. However, ^T still does that weird loop.

The ^T keystroke works to get me to files when I am trying to attach a
file. It also works to bring up the speller. (I have installed the PC
Speller. I wonder if that somehow interferes with the Save Attachment
commands?)

Not precisely.  You will want to something with procmail or something
similar.  They are quite effective.  A mail-filtering FAQ is widely
available on the web.

Check out 'procmail'.  This is a separate mail-filtering package, that
works regardless of your Mail User Agent (in your case, Pine, but could
also be mail(1), elm, pine, exmh, Netscape [yuck], etc.).  Do an Archie
search for it.

	Hi there,

	I've just set up filter and found out something I don't like. When
you get mail and it's filtered out to a folder different from inbox you
don't get the New mail message when login. Is there a way of telling
filter/pine/whoever to notice that? I'm thinking about modifying my
profile to test folders but there must be something easier, isn't it?
Thanks in advance, bye!!

	Hi there!!

	You know what? I've just been able to make filter work. And now
you ask this. You should look for a filtering faq (I found it with Yahho!
using the words: filter elm and mail). There you can find how to set up
filter. It's not hard (nor easy), just remember to change the attributes
of your home directory and use the right sintax. In case you have already
set up filter the sintax for the rules is:

if [ subject = "wathever" ] then action    Where action should be one of
this: save folder_name
      savecopy folder_name

	Be carefull, specially until you get used to filter, or you'll
loose lots of mails!! 

	Hope this helps, Bye!!

Hi,

I can see any character in the iso8859 character set, but I don't know

<HTML><BODY>
When using multiple address books, the nickname/alias is not checked for
duplicate entries in other address books. This is causing messages to be
sent to the wrong address. The need is to use multiple address books for
different discussions circles. In one address book the alias of BOB exists
and in a second address book an alias of BOB exists.
<BR>
<BR>When a user selects the alias BOB from the second address book the alias
in the first address book is used when sending the message. The question
is:
<BR>
<BR>Can pine be told which address book to use when using an alias (example:
book1/BOB) or can pines address book function be adjusted to check the
alias to see if the alias is already in use?

Subject: Using vi with pine
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


I've discovered that I kind of prefer vi to pico, and I was ecstatic over
the enable-alternate-editor-implicitly option, but my joy was short lived. 

The text that I write in vi doesn't wrap properly when it is imported back
into pine. From the sender's perspective, it looks like a bunch of long
lines. You see a few lines terminated by $'s. Which is all fine and dandy.
But from e recipients perspective (and you see this when you look at the
saved copy of the letter) the wrapping is somewhat fouled up. Text will go
for about 4 lines, and wrap suddenly half way through the fifth line,
resulting in a letter that looks like it was written while punching the
return key randomly. 

Other than using pico and consciously hitting return at the end of each
line in vi, does anyone know of a way around this?


Thanks,
-sno

You can use "wnewmail" or "newmail"... I don't know with which package it

Hi Folks,

when I try to compile pine for Linux, whether via build or make, it
always screws up.

echo "char datestamp[]="\"`date`\"";" > date.c
echo "char hoststamp[]="\"`hostname`\"";" >> date.c
cc    -g -DDEBUG  -DLNX -DSYSTYPE=\"LNX\" -DMOUSE -o pine addrbook.o

make: *** [pine] Error 1

Bloody well, what does that -ltermcap-thing mean, and how can I fix it.
Please reply via pm, as my newsreading isn't very reliable yet.

Thanx

As far as I understand the subject, mail filtering is not the job of a
'MUA' (Mail User Agent). PINE is a MUA. Mail filtering should be done
by the 'MTA' (Mail Transfer Agent?). Tell your 'archie' to seach for
'procmail'. procmail can probably configured such that it does what
you want.

My posts written from pine always come up with the author field as the

Where do I go to modify this?

You can also use procmail to filter for pine.

We are running on SCO 3.0 and would like to know if it is possible to have
Pine alert us when a mail message arrives.  We use a dial-up connection to
our IPS that is polled 4-6 times an hour.  It seems as though once the
messages are received, the only way to know (other than going into Pine to
check) is that upon logon we get a message "you have mail".  I have
checked the Setup menu thinking we don't have something configured
correctly but, I haven't stumbled on to anything yet.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Bill Harris

The beauty is that each one of us could make our own
version, so whoever writes these 'pick up the email
addresses and spam' have to spend equal if not more time
changing their parser, style what we always have to do with
.procmail filters :-). Fight fire with fire. Is this a good
idea to make sure that the email spammers get bounced mail
so their mailboxes are full? --Kent

MIME-Version: 1.0

mac 8100/80  system 7.5.2  ot 1.1  96megs ram

using ncsa telnet2.7b4 to access shell account on two seperate isp's,
pine unexpectedly stalls during use. stalling appears random but seems
to occur most frequently when shifting from one function to another
(i.e. shifting from individual message back to index.)

ppp connection is being achieved via isdn 56k.

could this be a ncsa telnet problem? interrupt process has never worked,
and the only way to back out is to quit telnet......

thanks for any clues!

Subject: Possible to do auto gzip in pine?
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi all,

I was wondering if it might be possible to pipe all saves through gzip
with something like 'gzip -c pinefile >> myfolder.gz' to save in a folder,
and retrieve all folders using 'gunzip -c myfolder.gz | <pine> ' in order
to save disk space?

In the alternative, if you get your mail from your ISP (i.e. don't run
your own MTA), you might be able to talk your ISP into filering well known
spammers from the system, possibly with an "opt-in" provision for users
who feel they're getting something useful from spam.com. I know that more
and more ISP's are doing this.

You would need some sort of urldecoder which could be triggered by
modifying the mailcap.  I think NCSA httpd comes with "urldecode" whcih
might do the trick.

However, I found that you could make most (all?) browsers sent the message
properly like this:

<FORM ACTION=mailto:rsh@Au.oro.net ENC-TYPE:text/plain>

I can't remember if ENC-TYPE has a hyphen or not, try it both ways but I
know it works, because I had this problem (only because my boss wanted the
actuall From: address that netscape generates so a CGI wouldn't work).

Hi!!

I have configured for pop3 today

but it fails to access INBOX after say 2 minutes or 
so. 

Also no. of times it is "core-dumping" on me.

WHAT SHOULD I DO??? I am really in trouble. I look around the 
archive but there is no definite answer to this. Any help
will be highly appreciated.

Tx,

Rajat Todi
