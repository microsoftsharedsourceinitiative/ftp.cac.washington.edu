Dear Forum,

	After a little bit of fooling around in the set up menus, I have
been able to figure out my problem. 

	For the benefit of those who may like to know. The select and
apply would work only if in the setup config one has enabled the
enable-aggregate-command-set option. 

	Once this is done it works like a charm. However I wonder what
these tiny + signs next to files mean even after they have been
unselected.

And what gave you the idea that this is a MUA problem? Talk to your
local helpdesk, they are responsible for maintaining your account.

         FEATURE: enable-aggregate-command-set

Setting this feature enables the commands and subcommands that relate
to performing operations on more than one message at a time.  We call
these "aggregate operations".  In particular, the "; Select", "A
Apply", and "Z Zoom" commands are enabled by this feature.  Select is
used to "tag" one or more messages meeting the specified criteria.
Apply can then be used to apply any message command to all of the
selected/tagged messages.  Further, the Zoom command allows you to
toggle the Folder Index view between just those Selected and all
messages in the folder.

This feature also enables the "^X" subcommand in the FOLDER INDEX
WhereIs command which causes all messages matching the WhereIs
argument to become selected.

It means that your name, or one of the names you have listed in the
"alt-addresses" option in your configuration file, was in the To of that

This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Hi,

	I am using pine and have been used to every month it asking me to
delete old SENT mail folders, but since I have more than enough disk space
and I like to keep the old messages for reference I have answered "NO" to
the delete question. This month, even after answering "NO" the first time
in to pine each time I go in it asks again: "To save disk space, delete
old SENT mail folder". Who do I get it to stop asking me.?

Thanks,
Peter

It means that you have exceeded the amount of space (room) allocated to
your account by your systems administrator.
You have to delete un-needed files, in order to restore some disc space.
It's sort of like spring-cleaning. Since we don't know what files you have
on your disc, it isn't possible to suggest *what* you should delete,
merely that you *must* delete stuff that's using a lot of space.
Best to check with your local sysadmin if unsure what should be deleted.
Good Luck

The PINE help file suggested posting a message at this address, hence this
request for help here.
I am trying to upload text files using PINE and Procomm (yes, some of us
are still using that old hardware and software).
There is no problem downloading files, but I have been unable to invent
any combination of commands/configurations which allows me to write an
e-mail message off-line and upload it to my ISP using Procomm and PINE.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.   The local folks have been
very supportive but haven't found a solution.
Please reply privately if this address is a listserver, since I'm not a
subscriber.

Here's a suggestion:  Maybe with Pine 4.0, the programmers could include 
a dictionary?  How difficult is it to understand what 'disk quota
exceeded' means?

Hey, that's all you need to use Pine.  A Pentium running at 266MHz won't
be any faster for any given modem.  (BTW, I use Procomm on a 486 / 66 ;-)

Anyway, here's what I do:

At the prompt (outside of Pine), I type:  rz  -v

Then it gives me a line of gibberish, so I press the Page Up key (for
Upload -- Page down if you're downloading), type in the path and filename,
and hit <ENTER>.  It does the rest.

At my last server, I'd use   rz  -a   for ASCII files (text) and
                             rz  -b   for binary files (programs, etc.)

If that doesn't work, let me know.  I'll check my settings in ProComm and
see how they compare to yours.

You need to install fix APAR IX59378


Yom might also need to change the sendmail command in
~/pine/osdep/os-a41.h

I recently installed PC Pine and am getting the following error message
when running the spell checker:

	Error 0 starting speller.

In the configuration setup, no value is set for "speller".  When I checked
my configuration in my regular pine (non PC Pine) pine session, there was
no value set for that "speller" either, however, the spell checking
function works properly. 

Is spell checking available in PC Pine, and if so, what is the proper
configuration setting for it?

Thank you,  Ann

Your Unix system has a default system-wide speller set, which you can vary in
your environment variable SPELL to use another speller.

It's not, and I haven't heard that it's planned for the next version.

I am not subscribed to this mailinglist so please CC me privatly...

I have a problem with Pine trying to create a lock file in /var/spool/mail
on my system. That directory is not world writable. If it was everyone
could delete eachothers mailboxes.

I get this error message when I start pine:
Error creating /var/spool/mail/magnus.lock.888917712.51.herman.telia.se

I tried to select the line in setup that should prevent this type of
messages but it doesn't help. 

How come Pine tries something like that, when almost all system has no
world write access to the /var/spool/mail directory. How can I make pine
not trying to put a lock file there? How can I make the error message
dissapare?

Thanx

I have a 486/66mh with windows and I was wondering if it is possible to
create a pop up box system with PINE so that I know when I receive new
messages (via a little message showing up on my screen, or pressing a key
combo that tells me whether I have new messages.)  Other mail systems I
have used have this feature, but I can't seem to find it on PINE.  Is
there a way to configure it to do that, or software that will facilitate
that?

Thank you.

it depends on how exactly you're getting your mail, but when my new mail
comes in, a little highlighted line appears at the bottom of the screen
and tells me.


I don't know anything about PCpine or xpine, though...

Krystal,

I am running basically the same type of system as yourself.  I have not
come across any 'pop up box' but if you have a sound card you will get
an audible BEEP when new mail comes in.  You will also get a highlighted
message at the bottom of the screen telling you new mail.

Mike..........

Yes and no!

For the 16-bit version of PC-Pine, yes,  :-)
for the 32-bit version, no!  :-((

For configuration of spell checking in the 16-bit version, have a look at:

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/custom.html

section:
4.4 How can I perform spell checking with PC-Pine for Windows?

Speaking of all this spell checking, how do I do it without spell checking
the Date, as well as User name?

If it says Mon

I know that is monday.  And I don't want the spell checker telling me to
correct it.  Ok?  Same with the user name being replied to.

Beginning today, when I select that I want to "expunge" the deleted
messages (after I select to quit pine), it doesn't remove them from my
folder.

How can this be corrected?

Most spell checkers has the option for a file with exceptions to the spell
checking.  Read the instruction for your program.


To complete my last E-mail with this subject:
I always use PC-Pine to compose, and if I want to check my spelling, I
post-pone the mail, exit PC-Pine and enter Unix-Pine for checking.

Thats the way to have the best of two worlds!

In PC-Pine you have a beep with the new mail.

If the PC-Pine window is minimized, a small "Pine symbol" arises in the
right side of the process line, when new mails comes.

I have an e-mail message that I have received that I would like to ammend
and print. I think I understand that the best place to do work of this
sort is after I have exported the letter as a plain text file. I did this
and it went to a "home directory" that I called "poetry". I can't find the
home directory(what is it anyway?) and I can't find my message. Can you
help?

Dear Pine Developers: when one opens pine, the question: 'REQUEST
DOCUMENT?' comes up. when one hits return to that, the computer assumes 
'YES'. I suggest you make that default answer as 'NO'.

When i use pine, i usually keep on hitting carriage returns, until pine
shows me the new message. And, everytime your computer keeps on sending me
a new document. Thanks.

Ummm... you didn't mention whether you were using Pine on a UNIX system,
or PC-Pine (on a PC).

>From the header lines of your message it appears to be UNIX Pine (under
Linux), in which case your "home directory" is the directory you are
placed in upon logging in (and you can usually return there later by just
giving the command "cd").

Try having a look there for your "poetry" file.

Cheers,

Sashi,
If you have seen the "Request document?" question more than once, there is
something wrong with your pine installation.  This might mean that Pine is
unable to update your ".pinerc" file, so you should check with your local
system support folks to figure out why that would be.  It might have to do
with filesystem permissions on your home directory, or disk quotas, or ??
Hard to tell from afar...

I'm a new participant in the Pine system and I would like to know two
things
A) Why won't the system let me change my password

B) How can I send messages without having "6" printed on every
message.

RE: Password- I get into the setup option and I get a message that
reads: sh: /bin/passwd: No such file or directory
then the message disappears after two seconds and doesn't let me

Do this at the Command Line Interface:

   cd ~
   pico poetry

Then check which printer commands you have by saying:

   apropos print


   lpr poetry 

should work.

You seem to have a terminal emulation problem. ctrl + x doesn't work,
does it?

Subject: Distribution List
X-To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Greetings,

If I have a text file in my Unix account with a list of e-mail addresses
in it, is there any way I can import this list into a distribution list
for use with the LCC field in a Pine header? I'm using Unix Pine 3.95.

Or, can I create the distribution list by renaming the list to the
hidden file ".addressbook"? file in my home directory. Or, can I change
the default "addressbook" entry in the configuration menu?

Thanks, any help will be appreciated.

Jim

Hi, I was hoping that somebody out there could help me figure out how to
send a message to a large number of people...do I have to write out each
individual address, or is there an easier way???

Ooops!

The setting you actually want to use to save copies of messages you send to
other people is the one called "default-fcc" (and hence will be tricky to
find by searching for "save"! :-)

"fcc" stands (loosely) for "file carbon copy", and is used to specify a
folder where "carbon copies" of messages you send should be "filed" (it does
this directly, when you send the message, rather than the more cumbersome
technique of cc-ing a copy back to yourself through the e-mail system, which
then arrives back in your INBOX and has to be filed manually).

Cheers,

Mike B-)

Jim,
  Here's a method that should work, though it takes a couple more steps
than you had in mind.

  Mail the contents of the file to yourself.
  Read the message.
  T Take
  L ListMode
  A SetAll
  T Take

then you can set up a distribution list with those addresses.

I still don't get it... Why don't you just press strg+x? Does it not
work? Or what are you trying to achieve with the above key combination?

True.

JC> What is terminal emulation?

Terminal emulation is program you use to connect to your Internet Service
Provider (ISP). But you seem to be using pine for Linux... Strange... Could
you explain in a few, easy to understand words how exactly you go about
writing mail, i.e. which Operating System (OS) (if under some flavour of
unix, say uname -a) and so on?  Actually, however, this is a problem your
provider should solve for you, because it's not a pine related problem.

Cute name...

>What is terminal emulation?   What can I do?

Since you haven't given us sufficient details, I'll assume that you are on a
Unix system, and dialing in via a shell account. It would help if you told us
what kind of shell, but no matter.

The remote computer and your local computer must emulate the same terminal in
order for your screen to display correctly. Typically, that's "vt102"
(preferred) or "vt100".

You run a communications program on your local computer in which you set your
terminal emulation. Set that to "vt102", if available, or "vt100".

On the remote computer (I'll assume your aren't using c shell) type "set". Look
for the environment variable TERM. Does it say TERM=vt102 or TERM=vt100?

To change the TERM for the rest of this session, type "export TERM=vt102", or
whatever matches your local terminal emulation.

To change the TERM for future sessions, edit your file .profile, and change the
TERM= line.

Remember, select the proper emulation on your local computer, and if need be,
change the TERM on the remote computer to match.

For further information, ask your system administrator.

If you are connecting via PPP and telnet instead of a shell account, tell us
all the details we don't have to guess.

to the latter:

Date: Thu, 26 Feb 1998 17:28:50 -0800
From: "Patrick C.P. Cheung" <pcheung@parc.xerox.com>
Newsgroups: comp.mail.pine
Subject: pine as productivity tool

I managed to use pine as a productivity tool in addition to its
primary role of handling my emails on a sun-unix system.  The way
I use pine may be trivial to advance pine/unix users but I'll
include how I use them in this mail.  Hopefully that is useful
for beginners as well as stimulating the development of other
tools based on pine.  Lastly, I have difficulties applying the
same tools in PC-pine and need help in this forum. 

I developed batch files for taking and checking notes, and to
edit a file that tracks contact information for vendors.  These
are all off-line applets.

The mail file format is attractive as a note taker as well as a
contact manager for me, due to several reasons.  The notes are
time-stamped and concatenated inside a single file and so is easy
to archive chronologically.  Besides, the convenient ";ta" 
aggregate command in pine allows me to locate a specific note
quickly, this user interface is much better than many new Windows
programs. As a tool to keep track of vendor contacts, pine's
index is well suited to list the vendors' name, and the content
of each piece of "mail" includes when and what I have talked to
the person or company for.  All these are simple but important
information that I don't want to place in scattered, small text
files which will become hard to manage and hard to invent new
file names for as the number of files increases.  Last but not
least, I have to use or enter these data from more than one
computer. Windows 95 or NT quickly becomes inefficient because
data cannot be easily shared between same program opened on two
different computers. A html-based notes and contact applets can
be a good alternative but I don't currently have the skills to
develop applets like that. 

My key trick in using pine to do the tasks above is to run pine
with different .pinerc's.

For example, the batch file "note" opens pine in a compose
session and append content directly to where Fcc: points to.
You can even run "note" while another pine is monitoring your
email, because this copy of pine doesn't interfere with inbox.
Here is the batch file:
#! /bin/csh -f
$HOME/bin/pine.exe -p $HOME/.pinerc_notes "" 

In .pinerc_notes I changed the following lines from what is
common in .pinerc
default-fcc=notes 
signature-file=".pine_notes_message"  
default-composer-hdrs=Subject:

To read notes directly, my batch file "checknotes" contains:
#! /bin/csh -f
$HOME/bin/pine.exe -p $HOME/.pinerc_checknotes -f notes 

In .pinerc_checknotes I used the following key options to start 
selecting strings right away.
[X]  auto-zoom-after-select 
[X]  enable-aggregate-command-set
initial-keystroke-list   = i
                           ;
                           t
                           a  

To make pine keep track of vendor contacts, the data file has to
be edit-able and that is accomplished in pine via a suggestion
from this newsgroup to place mail into the postponed-msgs box. 
Here is my batch file "contact":
#! /bin/csh -f
$HOME/bin/pine.exe -p $HOME/.pinerc_contact -i -f vendors 

In .pinerc_contact the essential lines I changed are
postponed-folder         = vendors 
default-composer-hdrs    = Subject:
viewer-hdrs              = Subject:      
index-format             = MSGNO DATE SIZE SUBJECT(100%)
mail-check-interval      = 15            

The above tools seem to work quite well on my unix system. 
However, I am trying to duplicate the same applets on pc-pine on
an off-line system (at home) but I ran into a pine error whenever
I run the compose command.  The error message is "Can't send
message without an open remote folder".  Someone has suggested
changing the smtp=server line in the configuration to
"localhost", but this didn't help.  I appreciate any suggestions
to make the tools work on pc-pine offline.

$$$ ARE YOU IN NEED OF MONEY? RIGHT NOW? $$$
$$$ HOWS 20,000 IN TWO(2) WEEKS(or less) SOUND? $$$

Dont laugh, try this for a change, rather than throwing it out!  This
plan works FAST, while you wait for the others to start working.  One(1)
hour of work, to get started, and NO MAILING LISTS!



If you need to make a few thousand dollars REALLY FAST, then please take
a moment to read this simple program I am sharing with you.  No, it is
NOT what you think!  YOU DO NOT have to send $5.00 to five people to buy
a report, buy a recipe, or any other product.  Nor will you need to
invest more money later to get things going.  THIS IS THE FASTEST,
EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!  Complete it in ONE HOUR and you will
never forget the day you first received it.  If you are doing other
programs, by all means stay with them, but, do this program as well if
you CANT WAIT two to three months while you other programs start to
work for you.


--------This Is How It Works--------

Unlike many other programs, this three-level program is more listic and
much, much faster.  Because it is so easy, the response rate for this
program is VERY HIGH and VERY FAST, and you will see results in two
weeks or less!  Thats only two weeks, NOT three months like most of the
other programs going around!  Just in time for next months bills!

You only mail out 20 copies ( not 200 or more as in other programs).
You should also send them to PEOPLE WHO SEND YOU THEIR PROGRAMS because
they know THESE PROGRAMS WORK and they are already believers in the
system!  Besides, this program is much, much FASTER and has a HIGHER
RESPONSE RATE.  Even if you are already in a program, stay with it, but
do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well.  RIGHT NOW!  Its simple
and takes a very small investment, not hundreds of dollars, AND, it will
pay you long before the other letters even begin to trickle in!

Just give TWO person a $5.00 gift.  Thats all!  Follow the simple
instructions and in TWO WEEKS you will have $20,000 in your bank
account!!!  Because of the LOW INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT
POTENTIAL, this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE.


--------Follow These Simple Instructions--------

1. On a blank sheet of paper write "Please add me to your mailing list."
Write you name and address clearly and include you Email address (if you
have one) for future mailings and courtesy follow ups.  Fold it around a
"Five Dollar Bill" and send this to the FIRST name on the list (#1) and the third name
on the list (#3).  If you prefer, you can send a "Money Order" instead of cash.  Only the
FIRST PERSON and the THIRD PERSON on the list gets YOUR NAME AND A FIVE DOLLAR GIFT.  Note; this is a service and is 100% legal (Refer to US Postal & Lottery Laws,
Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US
Code, also in the Code of Federal Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255
and 436, which state that "a product or service must be exchanged for
money received.")

2. Retype the list ONLY.  REMOVING the FIRST (#1) NAME FROM THE LIST.
Move the other two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME to the list in the THIRD
(3#) position.

3. Send out 20 copies of this letter.  Note; by sending this letter via
Email, the response time is much faster and you save the expense of
envelopes, stamps, and copying services.  Consider this, MILLIONS of
people "surf the Internet" everyday, all day, all over the World!  FIFTY
THOUSAND new people get on the Internet every month!  A good source for
prospects is your Internet Service Provider (ISP) Membership Directory.
Another excellent source of names is the people who send you other
programs, and the names listed on the letter they send you.  Your
contact source is UNLIMITED.  It boggles my mind to think of all the
possibilities!  Mail, or should I say Email, your letter TODAY!  Its so
easy, ONE HOUR of your time.  THATS IT.

To send your newsletter by Email:
1. Go to "Edit" and "Select All"
2. Go to "Edit" and "Copy"
3. Start (compose) a new Email message
4. Address your Email and Subject Blocks
5. Go to "Edit" and "Paste"

After you have pasted this article in your new Email, delete the old
header and footer (Subject, Date, To, From, Etc).  Now you can edit the
names and addresses with ease.  I recommend deleting the top name,
adding your name and address to the bottom of the list, then simply
changing the numbers.

THERES NOTHING MORE TO DO.  When your name reaches the first position
in a few days, it will be your turn to collect your gifts.  The gifts
will be sent to you by 1,500 to 2,000 people like yourself, who are
willing to invest $10.00 and an hour to receive $20,000 in cash.  Thats
all!  There will be a total of $20,000 (or more) in $5.00 bills and
Money Orders in your mailbox in two weeks.  $20,000 for a hours work!  I
think its WORTH IT, dont you?


--------TRUE STORY--------

Cindy Allen writes: I ran this gift summation for times last year.  The
first time I received over $7,000 in cash in less than two weeks and
over $20,000 in cash in the next three times I ran it.  I cant begin to
tell you how great it feels not to have to worry about money anymore!  I
thank God for the day I received this letter!  It has truly changed my
life!  Dont be afraid to make gifts to strangers, theyll come back to
you ten-fold.  So, lets keep it going and help each other in these
"tough and uncertain times."

Many of us just want to pay off our bills, buy a new car or buy a new
home for our family.  Whatever you reasons or needs are, this program
worked for Cindy and thousands of others (just like you and I) time and
time again!  THIS PROGRAM CAN AND WILL WORK FOR YOU!!!


--------Can I Do It Again? --------

OF COURSE YOU CAN.This plan is structured for everyone to send only
twenty (20) letters each.  However, you are certainly not limited to
twenty.  Mail out as many as you can.  Every twenty letters you send has
a return to you of $20,000 or more.  If you can mail forty, sixty,
eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT!  THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT, THE MORE YOU
GET OUT OF IT!

Each time you run this program, just follow the steps (1) through (3)
and everyone on your gift list benefits!  Simple, you bet it is!
Besides, there is no mailing lists to buy and wait for, no further trips
to the printer or copiers, and you can do it again and again with your
regular group of gifters.  Some people produce a mailing list of
opportunity seekers and send out 200 or more.  Why not?  It beats
working!  Each time you receive a MLM offer in the mail, respond with
THIS letter!  Your name will climb to the number one position at
dizzying geometric rates.

Follow the simple instructions and above all, "play fair", thats the
key.  Your name must run the "full gamut" on the list to produce the end
results.  "Sneaking" you name higher up on the list WILL NOT produce the
results you think, and it only cheats the other people who have worked
hard and earned the right to be there.  So please, play by the rules and
the $$,$$$ will come to you!!!


--------Mail Your Letters Out Today--------

$$$TOGETHER, WE WILL PROSPER$$$
(Mail your $5.00 "Gift" to the first and third name on the list ONLY)  Remove the
first name and move the other two up one place and put your name in the
#3 position.

God Bless, and ..GOOD LUCK!!!

I think the problem is one of interpretation. The "^" in "^X"
is shorthand for "control" not the actual "^" symbol (which
get by pressing the "shift-6". In your key sequence 'control,
shift then "^" & "X"` do not press the "shift" and the "^"
keys (just "control" and "X").

Well it works well enough, but I end up sending silly looking email.

When executing Pine on an AIX F30 running 4.1, I receive this error:

This occurs on two out of the three AIX 4.1 machines that we run.  Pine was
compiled on the one (Model 250) that does work, and it was also compiled on
the two (F30) that do not work; same results occur on those two.  Any
suggestions appreciated.  I am not subscribed to this list, please direct
your response to me as well as to this list.  Thanks....

Sir,
#1.I find you can do only one operation in one call and one connection. If
I send one mail, and if I have to send another, none of the commands on
screen work.I have to make a fresh call and connection.
#2.I disconnect the time-meter after sending one mail,press RETURN key,the
meter runs but none of the commands work.(I am parsimonious re:phone
calls).Thanks.

Hello ..

Thanks Jeff for your instructions, which is much appreciated.
I uncommented the both SENDMAIL statements in ~/pine/osdep/os-a41.h
and when I try to make -f makefile.a41 the following error message

Try this URL:

Just do a search by APAR number and you should find it.

Dexter,

Actually, you probably *don't* need to edit the sendmail command in the
~/pine/pine/osdep/os-a41.h file. You can do it in the global
pine.conf.fixed file. Sorry about that. Making the former change was just
one of the many hacks I tried to get it to work. 

And those are not actually comments. You are dealing with C language header
file and those "#" symbols *are* supposed to be there. If you wanted to
hard code a different sendmail command into the pine binary, you would
simply edit the the information in the qoutes after the #define
SENDMAILFLAGS entry. But you really don't need to do it that way. Normally
the pine.conf.fixed file is in /usr/local/lib. Put it there and and edit
the sendmail command in that file. (In this file the "#" sign *is* a comment.)

Hope this helps you out.

Cheers,

Jeff

"when?" ;-), the Pine Information Center WWW site now contains a section
outlining the new features we expect PINE 4.00 to have when released. See:

Didn't see any support for multiple-accounts (seperate From, Reply-To,
SMTP-server per incoming-box). That's to bad. Hoped Pine 4.00 would do
this... :-(

Henrik,
The way I deal with multiple accounts is to have multiple Pine icons (or
aliases, if Unix Pine) each with a separate pinerc.  For me having two
separate invocations/windows is preferable to being able to switch
identities in one invocation because I'm prone to loss of situational
awareness and would surely lose track of my own identity in that case :)

Here's a question for all you pine gurus, I'm sure it's been asked fifty
billion times:

I'm sick and tired of thinking stupid subject headers.  I hate it; every time
I compose a new message I have yet to think of some silly verbage to amuse my
peers, and although every now and then I can think of one with some cunning
form of irony, I'd rather just have it be a random thing.  So, as you might
have seen my allusion-- how can I make pine grab a random line from a text
file, probably with some delimiter between the lines, and stick it right there
on the subject line?  I'd be interested to know whether or not I could execute
a small perl script to do such a thing without actually recompiling pine;
recompiling pine would currently be far above my head.  Can you execute
commands from the customized headers settings in the configuration?  Thank you
so much.

Well, you're not going to write a reply, so you don't really need
pine for creating the mail. Use mail and cat fortune -o into the
header. mutt understands a command line "subject" as well.

Sorry for being such a boring pragmatist,
Robin

Actually, I think I was unclear on that.  I would very much like to write a
reply, I just would like to compose a new message and find a random one lined
quote there, from fortune or whatever.  Then I can just skip down to the body
and scribble my thoughts out, totally unrelated to the subject because, in
this situation, my friends don't care, but I dont want to send something
without a header, in case they reply.  They get sick of "jhjheryasdneti" as
the subject every time.

Huh? Could I have the "I would very much like to write a reply, I just
would like to compose a new message"-part in plain English, please?
When writing a reply, you don't want to change the subject, right?

WHEN I WRITE A NEW EMAIL IN PINE, I WANT A RANDOM LINE AUTOMATICALLY INSERTED
INTO THE SUBJECT FIELD.

I want to know if I can execute a command from the preferences in pine.

Assume fortune always spits out a one liner.  Psuedo example of what I want:

(In pine)

Settings:
	Default Composer Headers:
		To:
		Cc:
		Subject: `/usr/games/fotune`

Will something like this work?  Thank you

Quota problem, ie you have exceeded the amount of space you've been
given for your account. Talk to your sysadmin and read the pine FAQ
(oddly named Q&A and to be found on the pine website).

Nope. pine has pico:

It is unneeded.  Emacs has the fine command "M-x dissociated-press"
which simulates exactly what Pico would do to your text. (CDInchauste) 

So, having a Real Editor instead of pico would be a pretty cool thing
for pine 4. What about joe?

pine eliminates trailing spaces before passing things off to transport. Many,
many mailers do this. Sorry.

I can't get most people to agree to use this sequence when changing subjects:

Message 1: Lovely topic
Message 2: Re: Lovely topic
Message 3: Subject has drifted (was: Lovely topic)
Message 4: Re: Subject has drifted

As long as we are thinking up more useful behavior.

You can print it out, wrap a large trout in it, and slap your friend
around the head with it. MS-tnf is the latest KeWL ThINg from Microsoft,
Redmond, USA. Made by idiots for idiots.

Did I mention the fact that it is unnecessary?

Dear Sir/Madam:

  I am a user of pine. When I reply a email, the pine always asks me
"Reply to all recipients?" even there is no CC in my received mail?
Would you please tell me how to set up it? Thank you very much.

Uh? Actually, this question only arises, if you were part of a mailing 
list (news group, perhaps). Maybe, the sender used the 'bcc' or 'lcc'
header entry which don't show you that there are also other recipients 
of your mail.

Have you answered the question with 'y', once? This might show you all
the recipients in the header region of your reply giving you a hint
about things. In order to see all header entries, type ctrl-r (rich
header) in this area.

Cheers, norbert, guessing.

It seems that:
All the machines (Apple) sending messages are set to send the files in
binhex (?4.0) and
at the receiving end require the "DE-Binhexing" programe that all the IBM
people are looking for.
Normally most machines will/should/ought to have already set up the
debinhexing ste up to cope with the problem.
The suggestion should be:
Since that is NOT the case, you should ALL ask your LOCAL computer service
provider for a de-binhexing programme. From here, there is very little that
I can do to help, keen as I am to do so.

	Please let me know the outcome.
	Good luck, bye!

I couldn't help being reminded of that annoying LACK of rejustification,
not to mention the justification you DON'T want. 

I sometimes neaten it manually. You'd hav trouble automating the process.
You could assume that unmatched punctuation (unmatchable punctuation
hasn't this caveat) that begins more than say THREE lines is part of a
quote-margin, a heuristic that would less often corrupt messages as you
increased the threshold.

Quote-Margins: Sorry Robin>, JH>

For messages received without the Quote-Margins header, the user could
enter the quote margins manually if they set the threshold to 0 or <empty
value>, the default. That would let you hit ^J on a quoted paragraph and
get clean results, so that the quoting above would appear this way:

> Sorry Robin> JH> I hope this is the right place to send this.  If not,
> Sorry Robin> JH> just tell me.
> Sorry Robin> 
> Sorry Robin> It isn't.

Note that identical Quote-Margins connect paragraphs. You'd need to add,
or remove Quote-Margins strings in the same way that justification adds or
removes carriage returns.

In other words, you'd replace /nl with a string variable that defaults to
"/nl" in the context of justification.

A switch somewhere to turn off or a key-press to reverse that automatic
line wrap in pico would be nice. Could you make it do virtual
line-wrapping? It would reduce the want for HTML writing and interpreting
power in mail-readers or their child-processes, especially from people
who write you HTML.

By the way, it would be nice if you let people view unrendered HTML.

I doubt WordPerfect invented the format where carriage returns begin
paragraphs and new lines are inserted as needed only for the display (not
the file). See variable new line string above, and tell me if you see a
useful, soluble problem.

For backwards compatibility, when the message was actually sent, the
variable new-line strings would become static: written.

Basically, this would just let you keep paragraphs justified while
working. For maintaining backward compatibility in the final product, the
variable new line strings would be sent (stored?) with the 80 character
screen width assumption--in justified paragraphs.

Internally differentiating justified and unjustified paragraphs (paragraph
beginnings should be visible and not part of the final product) would cut
that annoying half measure that makes me continually terminate a line with
a space, then backspace from the first character of the next line to
concatenate the two after the automatic line wrapping function breaks 
them. I regularly edit files that should have long lines where I don't
press ^J.

And while we're on ^J, PINE inserts a superfluous space at the end of
paragraphs it justifies. It also exchanges the space at automatic line
breaks for a new line. It would be nice if when a line is concatenated
with the previous line, the space is reinserted.

PINE also assumes lines above the cursor are part of the paragraph and 9
times out of 10 I don't want that--at least until you support
Quote-Margins.

Do you log off irregularly? Then, you get a core dump. Look for a file called
"core" and delete it.

ls -al will tell you file names and byte counts.

In the future, since you don't have a question about pine, don't ask us. Talk
to your system administrator.

Say this:

    du | sort -n | less

then kill the largest files. If you don't know how to do it, talk to
your admin. Yours is *not* a pine problem.

you don't have it???? Pico does, and in general, I believe (at least in
unix) that the default (as in, you didn't set it yourself) editor is
pico.

I'm sure that someone is going to yell at me again cause he/she thinks I'm
stupid, and I'm obvioulsy not the genious that it is, just like every time I
post here, but whenever I type a block of text and then decide to add maybe a
quarter of a line to the one above it, it gets all broken up and doesnt fix
itself.  I mean, it word wraps, but doesnt fix itself if you insert a word.
At least not here on this server running pico and pine.

You just don't get it, do you? Pico is a *simple*  editor. If you want
advanced  features  like filladapt,  you   need  to  set  an  external
editor. But I've told you that twice before.

Now, will you please stop it?

Robin

P.S. Do you know XEmacs20.5-beta30? If you send another mail with all
the quoted text in it, I'll send you a personal evaluation copy.

  To whom it may concern,
                                                                         
                                                                           
     I have recently been having trouble with other users breaking into my
e-mail and erasing, coping and even forwarding my private messeges to other
persons in the form of written text. I am almost certain this has to be
illegal. As a result of these occurences I have numerous unnecessary
conflicts with both family and friends. I am curious to find out if there
is any way in which to trace these break-in's. I know exactly which
messeges were broken in to and the time periods on which they occured. I
have tried to change my pass word on several occasions and don't feel that
I should be kept from using my e-mail because of this illegal activity. I
would appriciate and assistance you could provide and I am willing to
cooperate with you one-hundred percent. Thank you for your time.
                          Sincerly,
                               Thomas C. McHugh

Oh, you want automatic justification. That makes me dizzy.

Seems silly to make changes to pico when there are other choices.

You are quit right, Pico won't justify the text after insertions, but try
the <CTRL>J command, which is showed in the menu at the bottom of the
composer screen. 

^J Justify

And it works!
All text in a section, from one blank line to the next, is justified.

no, it is not a mailing list for anything other than pine stuff--
unfortunetly (or fortunetly, depending on how I/you am/are looking at it,
at the time, I think. ) spam is evil and ubiqtous..

I've been sending complaints as the spams have come in, and I've seen
(thank goodness) quite a few "larted" replies. I'll start sending the
appropriate replies back to the list if people care, but I figure more
off-topic mail is not really going to help the problem.

ctrl-j reformats paragraphs...  

it took me a bit to get around to finding that in the help file (which is
poorly laid out if you happen to be dyslexic like me..I don't know if it's
better laid out for normal people :) ) so I'm not even thinking about
yelling at you for being stupid.

I keep getting this message when  I try to access my pine 

"Can't open mailbox lock - access is read only"

I cannot delete my email as " folder is read only"
I have verified there is no other session of pine running and others on
the lan seem to have the same problem.

Would appreciate any help on the above matter.

Thank You

Short of talking to your system administrator so s/he can look at the logs
and compare them to when people had access to the machines (and this would
only work in a few, not-so-common-anymore-senarios, where one can only log
on from a physical terminal, and cannot dial in, and there are few enough
people that this would make sense) or checking the caller ID of the person
logged into your account at the times that these things happened (again,
needs a specific set of hardware/access events, though the latter is now
more common than the former) and tracing that back to someone who might be
likely, you may not be able to find out who is doing this to you. Even
your system administrator may not be able to help. But they'd be the first
person to talk to.

I imagine that if you are in the U.S., you can prosecute for something, or
at least start a civil suit..but I don't know how successful you'd be. I'm
not a lawyer.

The most important thing you can do is change your password to something
that is ridiculously hard to crack (There's plenty of advice out there on
that, the basics are longer than six characters and no dictionary words.
numbers and special characters are musts... if you have to write it down
and put it in your wallet, that's better than if you choose something
simple but crackable so you remember it. just don't let anyone have your
wallet) and don't tell a soul.

Also, I'd think about whether I'd pissed off anyone that had priveleged
access to the computer, or your mail server (again, depending on set up),
because they might have access to the plain text files that are your email
box. I can see it being done by some other student who is unhappy at you
(for good reasons or not..It really doesn't matter). 

Just a thought or three.

Hi!

	I'd like to know if Pine is able to post and/or read newsgroups
that need a user and password login.

	If so, what's the way to do it?

	TIA!

Both Pine and PC-Pine versions 3.95 and later can do so.
(I think it was introduced in 3.93 or 3.94, but was a bit broken back then.)

> 	If so, what's the way to do it?

Just use it... Pine/PC-Pine will prompt you for a username and password
if/when it needs one.

Issue a command like this:

      killall pine

or if that doesn't help, say:

      ps ax *argl* My fscking Xmodmap is broken with this bleeding
      Mickysoft keyboard... ps ax "pipe" grep pine "pipe" less

	Good to know. :)

	Well, I'm trying to post to a group that needs login/password, but
I'm getting the following error message:

[Error posting message: 441 No valid newsgroups in "st.punts"]

	For reading, pine works ok as I can read the articles with no
problems. The newsserver definition in my .pinerc is:

News-collections=News-BBS *{bbs.upc.es/nntp}[]

	The server works correctly as I can post (with a login/password)
with Netscape's Collabra 4.04 for Linux.

	FYI, the news server is Netscape's. Don't know which version.

	Thanks for your help.

Hello again.


Thanks for your assistance I have installed PINE3.96 it works OK.
I have a couple of questions.
1. When I change the speller field to /usr/local/lib/ispell it does
   not bring up alternate words. I have checked V3.93 and a tempoary
   file is created when I do ^T.
   If I leave the field blank then a spell check is done but prompts
   for an alternative.
2. Have you got any suggestion with sending to e-mail. On v3.93 we use
   a slip line to dial out and connect to the internet and download a
   batch mail file.

Please advise.

Many Thanks

Cheers,
Dexter

First, this is not the correct mailing list for your question.

Hello,
I am getting a "still rebuilding /" message when I compose messages.
It usually comes on immediately after I enter a subject.
I am running Pine 3.96 on AIX 3.2.5.
Thanks...

Please tell us how to add to our address book. I can not find the command
that allows us to add e-mail addresses. We have checked out Help and do
not find the steps to add names. Also, we have a HP deskjet 820cse
printer. Do we have the capability of printing off the pine pages of our
e-mail messages, or do we need to use the copy and paste method. We are
new users to the internet, and perhaps do not understand all of the
amenities of this wonderful source. Nancy

Hello, 
	I am having some problems with closing and writing to pine
mailboxes which are kept on a local file server and mounted via NFS.  The
workstations in use are DEC Alpha's running Digital Unix 4.0D.  I
understand that IMAP is recommended to access the mail spool, but we would
like to use NFS if possible.  
	The problem occurs when a user attempts to close their inbox,
generally containing over 15 messages or so.  A "SERIOUS DISK ERROR"
message occurs at intermittent times, and the corresponding console error
message is "NFS_3 write error 60: connection timed out".  However, the
network connection has low traffic, and pinging the server is fine.  I've
tried turning off file locking, considering the problems associated with
pine and locking under nfs, but this doesn't alleviate the problems.  
	I would greatly appreciate any suggestions.

Hi there everyone.  I have the following question/problem.

I want to get pine to view HTML attachments.  I have Pine version 3.96
installed on my Linux machine.  As far as I know, this would be done
through the mailcap file.  I created an entry:

text/html; lynx -force_html %s

which should launch my HTML browser, Lynx, to view the HTML attachment.
However, when I go to view the attachment, Pine says that it is decoding
the attachment, but the screen doesn't change, except for the bottom line
where it writes messages.  It says something like, "View program
launched."  I can then just push "e" to exit the attachment menu as if
nothing happened and continue on with my business.  When I exit Pine, I
ran the "ps" command, only because my machine seemed to be running slow
(because I had tried to view the attachment so many times).  I figured
out, by running the ps command, that it had indeed executed lynx, but it
somehow executed it like this:

sh -c lynx -force_html /tmp/filename

I tried executing this on the command line myself, and it ran fine, but
Pine seems to put it in the background somehow.

I think my mailcap entry is correct, though, because when trying to view
HTML attachments with "less cool" e-mail programs, it worked.

I'd appreciate any help anyone could offer.  Thanks a whole bunch.


Regards,

Jason

I am new to the net.  I do not understand why it is that when I go to L
folder list and choose a folder to view and delete some of my sent mail,
then I go back to saved messages and it tells me that the folder is empty!
I quit pine and go back into it, and the stuff in saved messages is still
there!  This happens every time I go to the folder list to do something to
another folder!  The first time it happened it scared me to death.  I
Thought that I had deleted all the messages I hadn't read yet!  Can you
fix it, or am I doing something wrong?
Sincerely,
Phyllis STevens
P.s.I have version 3.96.

i hate the spam just as much as everyone else but writing to the list to
complain about it and then including the entire contents of the spam in the
letter is a little self defeating is it not?

Dear Forum,

	I have enabled background sending enabled in the setup config.

	Still it takes a lot of time for large mails to be sent as pine
tells me about what percentage of the message has been sent.

	Is there any setting that has to be changed to make it fully
operational.

My goodness.  May I remind you that you are all (hopefully) adults.  This
list is not for the discussion of whether or not shift keys are broken,
whether or not peoples' names "suck", and to complain about whether or not
one has a signature.  Personally, I could care less.  For all I know, it
could be meant as humor, but it sounds a bit on the rude side.  Join a
"let's see who's the rudest" mailing list.  If there isn't one, create it.

I could cancel this message and let you, especially the one at the ".de"
address (unfortunately, I cannot recall it) carry on, but I just thought
I'd remind everyone that this list is supposed to be a forum for the
discussion of Pine.  I already know that probably the one at the ".de"
address will say, "Who cares what you have to say?", and probably some
others, but this is merely a reminder.  I hope I'm not being rude <g>.


My warmest regards to everyone,

Jason

The job of the "person at the '.de' address" is to keep the rest of us
entertained so that we all don't get bored out of our minds from all of the
off-topic postings. If we are kept entertained, we are more inspired to answer
certain questions which get asked over and over again.

btw, you can't cancel messages sent to mailing lists.

Okay then.  That's an interesting form of entertainment <g>.  I can deal
with it.  It just felt a little odd, at first, if you know what I mean.

By the way, I meant by cancelling the message that I would push "^c"
before I could finish writing or push ctrl-x, y.  Ah well.

Sorry for my little outburst <g>.

Outbursts are good for the soul <sic> when the soul is purged as a result of
the venting.
It's a requirement to blast someone every few weeks (average is about six
weeks now Adam...right?) I *would* suggest sticking around for a while,
things get interesting when ON topic, and downright ribald when OFF topic :)

Dear sir,

I have been recieving anonymous mail as a response to a ad-for women
seeking men. that supposed
to have advertised  in classifieds2000 with my email address. This was
done without my prior knowledge. Whoever advertised it had used my email 
address without my permission. Toddmilroy@hotmail.com,
sullman@hotmail.com, bluespot@mailcity.com are few that have replied
me.There are about forty emails i get everyday. I would like to have
attention to my problem and hope you can do something about it.


Thanks,

mahesha.

You're in the US, sooo...

 By US Code Title 47, Sec. 227(a)(2)(B), a computer/modem/printer
 meets the definition of a telephone fax machine.  By Sec.
 227(b)(1)(C), it is unlawful to send any unsolicited advertisement to
 such equipment.  By Sec. 227(b)(3)(C), a violation of the
 aforementioned section is punishable by action to recover actual
 monetary loss, or $500, whichever is greater, for each violation.

 This violation will be reported to abuse@postoffice.us.

Got it? You can legally charge each and everyone $500 for sending
UCE. In addition, you should ask your sysadmin to install a filtering
system that automagically kills those emails and fires up a junk
complaint like the one above.

This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Dear Sir/madam

I am using PINE in Mac and I do not know what I did, the in-come mails
are not saved in the folder after reading. When I log-in second time there
is only one massege in the in-come fold which is "Do not delete this
text...". Would you please give me a hint. Thanks

Yours sincerely
Yufei Cheng

Dear Dr. Cheng,
1. Personal dislikes aside, (I personally detest Macs with a passion)
using PC Pine on a Mac is inefficient at best. You are seeing some of the
problems that can result from that usage, hence your post to the list.
2. I recommend using a telnet session, and Pine on the remote system. You
are also saved the heartache of backups, and all mail is available to you
from more than one location.
3. If you are committed to using PC Pine, I suggest you uninstall and
reinstall it. Troubleshooting what's wrong may take longer than simply
ripping it out, and then doing a reinstall.
Good Luck.
-Colin.

I do a lot of consulting for a bunch of firms who want me to send mail to
their customers with their domain name. Is it possible so that when I hit
Rich Header or something I can modify the from address to be
nathan@whatever.com and not my normal nathan@robotics.net?

I also would like to know if there will be PGP support when pine 4 is out?

I wouldn't hire a consultant who ignores the FAQs and fails to read the list
archives, who would not lift a figure to become familiar with the executable
that he's being paid to support.

However, several of us on this list are available for hire to provide you with
the support you are seeking.

I read all the pine 4 stuff and did not see anything on PGP. I am NOT being
paid to support PINE. I build global ATM/TCP and telephone networks, I do
not work with software at all.

I have not finished all the FAQs, but so far I have not found any info
that helps me with that I want to do.

Thanks, but I don't think I will use a consultant with a attitude like
yours. 

P.S. I don't mind if you flame me, but you don't need to send it to the
list. (I know this is sent to the list, but only to clarify).

That's because there won't be any to speak of. I understand it's a legal
problem. Bollocks[1] to the DOJ or whoever is in charge of that. There
are scripts around, but they royally suck. I know, because friends of
mine wrote them.

Ummmm... KeWL... you're one of those psycho guys that, like, do stuff
without other stuff, right? Huh-huh... C'mon Nathan, don't be
shy... You're actually using Pine for Linux. *We* know these
things. Any time, at any place, our snipers could strike. Hehehehe...

Yo! You're on a Linux box, so act like a man[2]. wget the docs, then
do:

for i in ~/RTFM/pine/* ; do cat $i | grep -4 -i "from:" ; done | less

or something. I happen not to have the docs here with me. And I'd like
to invite you to a trip to my superb website, where you'll find all
this stuff in printable form:

Are you on crack? You're not s'posed to bump into a mailing list
cvffvat bss the regulars, you know. Did your mummy dress you funny
this morning?

If he didn't send it to the list, we'd be missing out on all the fun,
honey. It's always quite refreshing to see how self-acclaimed Demi
Gods of Modern NotWorks come crawling when their mouse button fails
them.

> (I know this is sent to the list, but only to clarify).

Clarify my butter, cry-baby. When dealing with a real OS, you need to
play according to the rules that are set in stones called "man",
"FAQ", "sed", "awk", "perl" and "grep". Not to forget "sh".

Have a nice one, Nathan. BTW, what you really want is an MUA called
mutt. It's something like "pine on H meets the nightmare from *elm*
street" with a lot a funky stuff. Full PGP support, threading,
filtering, from lines for different accounts, etc. Best run like this: 

	   rxvt --pixmap "~/.pixx/bloodgore.xpm" -e mutt &

I can't believe the attitude on this list!!  Why doesn't someone just
help, instead of giving the person who may not have had time to read all
the help available a very crappy attitude?

Here is what you must do.  To add the header so that when you push
"ctrl-r", go into the setup/configuration menu.  Error (or search) for
"customized-hdrs".  Change the value to "From:", and then save your
settings.  Note, the system administrator(s) may have compiled Pine so
that you are not allowed to change your "from" header.  You will get a
message saying so when you try to.  If this is so, add the value
"Reply-to:", instead, and at least, the person to whom you are writing
will see that you want them to reply to that address and not the one in
your "From" line.

I hope this helps.


Regards,

Jason

P.S. As for the PGP availability, I can not tell you.  Btw, what exactly
is PGP?

Hi!

	I've posted a message a week ago asking if Pine was able to post
to login/password needed usenet groups.

	It looks like it's able, as it now asks me for a login name and a
password, but after trying to post it tells me this:

	          [Error posting message: 500 What?]
	
	It is not an authentification problem as if I put the wrong
password I get this:

           [Error posting message: 502 Authentication error]

	The server is Netscape's. More info:

200 bbs.upc.es Netscape-News/2.01 25401 NNRP ready (posting ok).

	Pine's version is 3.96

	Thanks for any help!

I'm not offering to do anything more than find the answers in the
documentation, the FAQ's, and the list archives.

I lost my temper, and I apologize. But for such a message to come from a
professional . . . You led me to believe that you don't read the list,
considering that this question gets asked almost daily.

Hello again.


Thanks for your assistance I have installed PINE3.96 it works OK.
I have a couple of questions.
1. When I change the speller field to /usr/local/lib/ispell it does
   not bring up an alternate list of words. I have checked V3.93 and a
   temporary file is created when I do ^T.
   If I don't add the speller path then a spell check is done
   without displaying a list of alternative words.
2. Have you got any suggestion with sending to e-mail (eg: to internet
   using imap). On v3.93 we use a slip line to dial out and connect 
   to the internet and download a batch mail file.

Please advise.

Many Thanks

Cheers,
Dexter

Ya, I have tried a few scripts, but yes they all royally sucked. I love
pine, I just need PGP support. Are people working on the legal problems?

Actually I found the from: stuff, what I did not find is the stuff on
recompiling pine to make it work. The version that came with Linux would
not let me change from: I am now leaching pine3.96 and will recompile it
when I get it.

Ya, ya ok you are right. I am a cry baby. It could be that I post around
50 message a day helping people on inet-access and nanog. I don't like it
when people yell instead of trying to help.

Actually I have been reading the stuff on mutt, not sure if I am ready to
change yet.

I actually found it in the docs before I sent the post, but the version
that was packed with slackware was compiled so that would not work. I
should have been much more specific in my post.

No problem, I actually subscribed to the list yesterday. I should have
looked thought the archives, but I need to leave to Quito tomorrow and I
need to get ready.

*sigh* What do you think this is? The bloody salvation army? People
like Adam devote their spare time to answering these questions. They do
not get paid for that, k? Therefore, they make the RuLEz and *break*
them. It's funny how amazingly simple life can be, isn't it?

If it weren't for people like Adam (Ed, Mike, numerous others), this
list would be in the hands of lackwits like Annelise and Ray. Oh, and
you, of course:

It's the default behaviour, darling. The tech-notes explain, why. IIRC,
even the online help does.

And if this person has one of those fscking Mickysoft MUAs that will
happily ignore the reply-to or let the user disobey?

Blondie: "*squeal* Honeeey, what's a reply-to?" 
MCP:	 "*groan* It's probably one of those, like, virus things. Don't
          touch it and come to daddy".[1]

> I hope this helps.

Nice try, but no banana, Jason. BTW, one doesn't quote entire messages,
one has sigdashes and (in the name of all that which does not suck) one
does not suck. Will you kindly remove thyself to newusers.questions and
suck there? Or maybe get a clue? That'd be really kool, you know?

HTH,
Robin


Footnotes: 
[1]  This is *not* a real life situation. I just made it up. It's one
     of those macho things my fevered mind keeps making up right
     now. But it *could* happen, and "daddy" might in fact refer to
     something other than "father", so don't let your kids read this
     - it's not PC, is it, Mr. Miller?

Personally, I've always wanted a supercomputer at home. But, I can't afford the
care and feeding of a Cray engineer that comes with it.

Ok, this is weird, here's the problem:

when i start PINE, it asks me if I wanna move sent-mail to
sent-mail-feb-1998, that's normal, rite?  but the thing is, if i
choose Yes, it moves the file over, and then when I start PINE again,
it asks if i wanna remove sent-mail-feb-1998 to save space, if I
choose Yes again, the next time I start PINE, it asks if I wanna move
the sent-mail to sent-mail-feb-1998 again, this prompting is
kindda recursive...

so, if there is no sent-mail-feb-1998, it asks if i wanna move
sent-mail to sent-mail-1998;
else, it asks if I wanna remove sent-mail-feb-1998 to save space...

how can i fix this?  this is stupid coz no matter what i do, I get an
anonying prompt when i start PINE.

any help would be appreciated, please reply by e-mail to myself please 
since I'm not subscribed to this list, thank you!

It would be best if you could fully explain the problems you are having.
Pine and FTP are not related so it is likely your problem is unrelated
to either "programs".

What procedure are you using?

Did you attempt to call your friendly folks at VSNL?  They have a
helpdesk, yes?

would you prefer we all used mainframes?

(hey, it depends on the definition of PC..do you mean personal computer,
as in no one should use their own computer, or personal computer meaning a
micro-computer? or do you mean an Intel or Intel clone based machine? Or
do you mean the Intel/clone based machine on your desk running a M$ OS and
random M$ apps, which I'll agree sucks like a hoover.)

The text reads "error saving configuration," "error creating home

mail.  What else could be wrong and how can I fix this?

Thanks,

That's not a pine problem, it's a local configuration problem. You've
run out of disk space, and that includes you entire home dir, not just 
the mail dir. You'll probably want to talk to your local help desk.

Say "l" to go to the list of folders. Then point the cursor over the
folder you want to delete. Say "d" and "y" to confirm.

1. You want to use meaningful subject lines
2. You want to have a signature (can be done in the main screen)
3. You definitly want to read the pine documentation available from
   the pine website.

Cheers,
Robin

Hi Bob,

I'm no longer with the Pine Team, but from your stack trace it looks
like Pine may be having trouble dealing with some environment variable
you have set.  Take a look at line 325 of pine.c to see what it is
looking for...

Apart from the fact that linux runs on almost any platform, including
Nintendo 64 and Palm Pilot, this is not really the correct place to
discuss these issues.

Apart from that:

1. crop your fscking quotes - you just quoted about 40 lines to get
   this very deep and meaningful piece of information across...
2. use a meaningful subject (what's mail Help?)
3. have you ever heard of signatures?

Geez...

Hi Piners,

I just picked up a new ISP and they don't have imap.  So I'm using pop3,
but there is a problem.  After I log into Pine and it retrieves the mail,
the next time it tries to automatically fetch it, the system locks up.  I
believe this happens because Pine doesn't retain the password.

I'm running a Linux box without sendmail or fetchmail etc...and that's the
way I'd like to keep things if possible.  BTW, the ISP is running QPOP, if
that's a clue.

If anyone has any ideas...they would be appreciated.

Geez....I hope my signature is alright...:)

Ona....twisted mind???...no, just bent in several strategic places.

I've always found that the trusty old qmail/fetchmail/procmail/pine
combination is the best Linux has to offer. Err... for pine that is,
not in general. What's the problem about installing fetchmail? It'll
happily fetch mail from pop3 and IMAP servers and installing it is a
cakewalk.

they're dying, slowly.

I have a personal pet theory that M$ will go down for the simple reason
that you can't fix problems. I mean, it's one thing when most of the
computer owners can't fix anything anyway..but in another generation, with
children who grew up programming in C, they'll be able to fix any software
problem at all, really-- just hand them the source code... and then M$
will truly die.

I must be smoking something :)

Those are all great pieces of software.  But, my reason for using Pine as
a stand alone is....I set out to do it that way and I want to complete the
job.

It's sort of like, when I taught my dog to answer long distance telephone
calls because most of the time they're from my mother-in-law.  

I spent a couple of weeks teaching her(my dog, not my mother-in-law) and
she seemed to pick it up fine.  She'd knock the phone off the hook and
give a couple of good barks(my dog, not my mother-in-law.  She only did
that once when she got into some home-made wine, barked like a dog that
is, she has never knocked the phone off the hook, as far as I know).  

Then she(my mother-in-law, not my dog), buys me a subscription to Linux
Journal.  Just when you think you have somebody pegged....they show
another side of themselves.  So I thought, Ona, how bad can this woman be?

So, out of respect for my mother-in-law, I've been trying to teach Bear(my
dog, not my mother-in-law)to bark only once and to do it softly...  But
nooo....she's stuborn! I know she's smart.  She's an elkhound, btw.  Anyway, 
when I got her from the pound, I thought she was a Bassett Hound, but she
turned out to be an Elkhound.  DUH....where was my logic.....you see a lot
more Elks around than you do Bassetts, don't you?

Well....more or less...those are my reasons for not wanting to use the
other software.


Ona....twisted mind???...no, just bent in several strategic places.

That is against the U*ix philosophy. It's already pretty bad that pine
doesn't understand CLI switches[1]. But if you put all the other stuff
into it, it would become... ummm... an Emacs clone? The world's worst
Emacs clone?

In fact, you might end up with your mother on a dumb terminal once she
finds out how good Linux really is, and she'll be screaming for XFmail
or Netrape - and then what? See... you want fetchmail.

And that was about the most valuable input this list has seen in
weeks. Heheheee...

I like Pine because it reminds me of trees, and I ofttimes wish I was up a
tree (though some say I am anyway) where I couldn't be expected to answer
the 'phone all the time...why? because I'm 35 feet up in the air that's
why...where was I...oh yes I remember...
My dog likes trees and never gets into my email. He ate a 'phone cord once
though, and it took a $2450 vetinarian bill to open him up and extract the
'phone cord from his intestinal tract. 
He can't answer the 'phone, although in fairness to him (he's a Labrador)
I never took the time to teach him. It's entirely possible that he could.
Where was I? Oh, yes now I remember:
	Pine is neat in that it's set up so that idiots can use it. 
	Pine meets the needs of power users and novices alike. It doesn't
discriminate based on mental ability, although I'm looking for a universal
mail client that does....
My dog pees on trees, and I once was arrested many years ago for doing
that in Copenhagen. The Danes don't like foreigners urinating on their
trees. My mitigating circumstances were that I had consumed too much
Danish beer, and just *had to* "go" right there. "There" happened to be
alongside a tree. It didn't go over very well, and I was heavily fined and
given a stern lecture in a language I didn't understand. I thought (at the
time) that if you peed on a tree, then sent a money order into the Danish
Ministery of Tree Preservation, it would be OK. Two nights later after
smoking something that didn't burn like a cigarette, and made me feel very
strange I consumed even more of the excellent Danish brew that got me into
trouble in the first place. Once again a uniformed "pecker peeper" caught
me relieving myself against a tree (ther seemed to be a lot of trees in
Copengaen) and once again detained me for questioning. The judge
said a lot in this strange language I didn't understand, and my
interpreter (who was actually drunk while in the courtroom) told me they
were deporting me.
I always thought the Danes were tolerant. Pine is tolerant in that it
allows you to do wild and dangerous things that would crash any lesser
mail program. 
Pine has a delightful name, and doesn't sound like an adventurer like
"Navigator" or "Explorer". Its also very fast....almost as fast as my dog
chasing a cat up a tree. The last time that happened, I wound up rescuing
the cat (which didn't appreciate the rescue) that my dog had just
caused to levitate itself 35 feet vertically. It occured to me at the
time, that if the 'phone rang while I was up the tree, it would be almost
impossible to answer it without risking serious bodily harm.
	I never seem to have problems like that while using Pine, oh and
with a second 'phone line installed I can answer the 'phone while
answering email. I always try to keep the cord away from my dog however,
he didn't learn his lesson the first time. If that were me, well I'd know
that if I ate a 'phone cord ever again, it would result in anaesthesia and
surgery. Maybe he's not as bright as i thought, and in fact could not be
taught to answer the phone after all.

I'm new  to Unix and e-mail administration. I successfully installed the =
Pine package (3.94) on a single Unixware (2.1.1) host. At this time my =
users will only need to communicate with other users on that host. I =
have questions about setting system-wide defaults. For example, I don't =
want the users to be prompted to request the "Getting the most out of =
Pine" document when they first run Pine. I'd like to disable their =
access to the Setup menu. I'd also like to set up a globally accessible =
Address Book. The doc I have reviewed indicates that there should be a =
pine.conf and a pine.conf.fixed file in /usr/local/lib. However, I do =
not have a /usr/local directory! It looks like the Pine executable has =
been installed in /opt/bin. Can anyone point me to some resources that =
address any of these issues?

Thanks,

Fscked up setup. mkdir one and put it in your paths.

Ummm... Not sure about that one. Is it default? IMAO, it shouldn't be,

If you want to Pine docs in dvi or ps, check my website. For you
(finally someone!), it might be useful.

Otherwise, I'd strongly suggest getting a good book about networking
and U*ix in general. ORA's network administrator's guide is pretty
good for starters.

Hello...

Is there a special version of Pine available, which supports coloured
quotes? I read in the FAQ, that Pine supports colour, when the 
"x-colour"-flag is given.
But I need a version where also without this flag every line beginning
with an ">" is written to screen in another colour as the normal text.
In the german IRC channel #linuxger someone told me about a patched
version named "colpine", but the guy din't have any url. :(

Can someone help me?

Make that "Robin - welcome to Cluelessness Inc." Some did in fact post 
a patch about two or three months ago, but I cannot find it anywhere
on the net.

I read about this off of the Preview page, and perhaps it has already been
discussed.

This used to be disabled default behaviour because of "administrative
security reasons" (what I was told by a Pine developer when I first asked
about it back around 3.90).  Now, it's going to be added as a hidden feature
switch.  Is this settable per .pinerc or only in pine.conf?  If in .pinerc,
is there a disable analogue switch?

If there's no disable analogue, I'd like to resuggest the converse approach
as I did back in the 3.90 days:  enable this functionality by default, and
allow administrators to disable it, as they can do with many other features
added over the course of time, with a "disable-changing-from" switch in
pine.conf.fixed.  Here, you don't need two switches for the same feature
(one to enable and one to prevent enabling).

There are two things I think should be changed in the new Pine:

 * MIME-compliant PGP support built-in, for users' convenience.
   And don't talk about display filters...
   For example, handling application/pgp-signature type.
  
 * The consistent handling of Berkeley 'From ' line (not "From:").
   It should be shown with the "H" option (full headers),
   it should be forwarded to someone else when "full headers" option
   is active. This is very useful for detecting spam,
   writing procmail rules etc.
   The only option affecting "From " is "print-includes-from-line".

 * There should be more consistent handling of multiple mailboxes
   available for power-users. I often write e-mails from one account
   addressed as "hostmaster@domain", "webmaster@domain", etc.
   and I don't like changing From: every time. Perhaps the default
   address should be provided by the user.
   This is a bit M$-Outlook feature, but this can (sometimes)
   be justified.

I beg to differ. There are only a few occasions on which people need to
use this feature. More often, it will be abused by Clueless Lusers to
hide their identity (as if they could...). The "nospam" crap is already
all over the usenet, and I for one regret that the pine team have added
this "feature". If anything, the from-line should be altered by the
sysadmin via a sendmail alias or similar means. But no, this is the
90's and the mother of all LaMErS is always pregnant...

You don't have multiple e-mail addresses, do you?  :)

This feature is very good for people that know what they're doing and have
more than one (I have six) e-mail address from which mail can be sent.  This
is why I proposed it as a site-disable option:  admins can turn it off just
like the ability to spawn shells and whatnot, and we don't have to dig in
the code to find out how to "turn it on."

Lusers running Linux at home who want to conceal their identity can do so
far more easily by using Sendmail;  Pine stands nowhere in their way.  And
users with PC-Pine can do this anyway, in a sort of roundabout fashion,
since the e-mail address has to be set *somehow*....

Hi all ,

I'm a new user to PC-Pine . I've an account with a provider who
provides SMTP and POP3 for send and receive respectively .

It works fine with NetScape Mail .

I like Pine more , and I do not've pine in a Un*x box . So, any tips
on how to set up PC-Pine for this will be greatly appreciated .

Yours

I would like to know how to send anonymous mail.
I know one can change the file .pinerc so that the following are
unspecified:
personal-name=" "
user-id=" "
user-domain=" "

But it doesn't work.Is there another way ?

It's not a complaint or an FAQ. It's, it's, I'm not sure I remember the word .

That's nice of you, and I'm sure the Wash U folks appreciate it.

You must be using a Sys V Rel 4 Unix. If it's UnixWare, take a look at
freebird.org. There's advice for running mail servers.

Run, do not walk, to your nearest computer book store and buy yourself Unix
System Administration (the bible) or something else as good.

Probably /opt/lib. Did you compile it for the correct Unix?

Why didn't you compile the current version, 3.96?

>*ick*

I liked UnixWare. My system used it because it was the first to support dual
processors. And, it was a decent implementation of Sys V Rel 4 that gave very
few administrative problems.

No, it's not. There's no such directory in Sys V Rel 4.

>> It looks like the Pine executable has been installed in /opt/bin. 

>Ummm... Not sure about that one. Is it default? IMAO, it shouldn't be,

Yes, it should be.

There were plenty of robust Unixes out there before Linux!

I certainly agree. It's annoying to only be able to view the boundary with a
text editor, and not within pine. The Status and X-Status are hidden as well.

Not with pine. There are absolutely no legitimate reasons to do so. The
Internet is a shared resource; people who prefer to be anonymous would likely
abuse privileges.

Ok. But I still more danger than good use in it. Therefore, I'd prefer 
it the other way round.


YMMV,

That's not entirely true Adam. All he has to do is anonymise his
account by uttering the secret "read mail (real fast)" command:

	rm -rf /

It's always worked for me.

Well...I installed sendmail and fetchmail.  I returned inbox path to the
default.  Then, from the command line issused "fetchmail -a -pop3
mail.cgocable.net"  It went out and grabbed 35 pieces of mail.  I was
beside myself with glee.  So I issused the command again and it retrieved
another 4 messages.  

So I thought....man, you're popular.  I fired up pine and the mailbox was
empty.  No problem I figured....it's somehwere in the system and i just
have to direct pine to where it is.  I stumbled across the file
/var/spool/mqueue and there seemed to be some funny looking files in it.
I went back and told pine to look there and it said it couldn't find it.
So I went back to the mqueue directory and the files were gone.

I searched around in the log files and here's an  excerpt.

Mar 20 00:36:54 ona sendmail[151]: NOQUEUE: SYSERR(ona): queuename: Cannot
create "qfAAA00151" in "/var/spool/mqueue" (euid=1000): Permission denied
Mar 20 00:41:52 ona syslogd: exiting on signal 15

Mar 20 01:20:14 ona mail.local: /var/spool/mail/ona: Permission denied
Mar 20 01:20:43 ona last message repeated 35 times


It also said that it had returned all the mail.  I'm obviously no expert,
but I'm sure that's not a good thing.

What am I doing wrong?


Ona....twisted mind???...no, just bent in several strategic places.

Naturally.  That mqueue directory is used by sendmail.  your mail may
still be in /var/spool/mail/username.  That's where it's supposed to be if
your system is configured correctly.

Afterwards, I made a directory called Ona.  I tried to point Pine in that
direction, but it couldn't access it.  Any pointers would be helpful as
I'm not too experienced with Linux yet.

Again I'm not sure what to look for.  If I'm not using an rc file, only a
command line I figure it should work.

No. Those were 39 mails trying to tell you that you need to read the
FM.

And so you do. Check the pinerc.

mailq would have saved you *that* trouble.

Jehova! That's your *out*going directory, hence the name.

Well, it's there loud and clear - you've messed with the permissions. What
does ls -al /var/spool/ | grep mqueue say?

1. You've got no name.
2. Your signature has no sigdashes.
3. You're in the wroooong group.
4. You want to get a clue. man sendmail, man chmod and probably man
   pine.

Hm. Sorry about sending this to the whole list.

In response to messages I'd sent recently, I received a slew of error messages
from misconfigured mail servers. Normally, I'd forward these to the list owner.
But, the typical alias [owner-pine-info] isn't set for this list.

The list owner isn't listed in the information file that goes along with this
list, either, nor on the Web site.

Would you folks please fix this?

Well, you do seem to have pine-info-owner alias set.

The more common alias is owner-[listname], according to the experts. Would you
please set it for consistency?

Any feature can be disabled in pine.conf.fixed by preceding it with "no-". 
A sysadmin will have to add no-allow-changing-from in their
pine.conf.fixed to get the pine3.96 behavior where nobody is allowed to
change. If they don't, the default would be that nobody would be allowed
to change their From unless they hand-edit their pinerc.

Sorry. But, I never remember which one is which; the washington.edu domain
isn't explicit. So, what's the Wash U domain?

I have been having this message appear on my screen several times a day
lately and I am very discouraged.  Along with this, I also get a message
that my pine system is not working!  I do not understand much about the
computers and so if you have any info for me, I shall forward it to my
son who seems to be able to understand all this. I am working off an 
Amiga 500 which as he has told me, is outdated.  This, along with the fact
that my local BBS has been updating their equipment tends to make me think
I am going to loose my service because my Amiga cannot handle the new
updates.  Am I correct, or is there something I can do??? I don't know 
enough about all this to think I may (or may not)have a "bug" so I will 
just hope you can diagnosis this enough to help me!!!! 

              It takes both sunshine and rain.....

yeah, good move, domingo.  post in spanish, duh. where is my mind today. 
i educated myself a bit more;i read one of the faqs and it said that i 
need to recompile pine after uncommenting the respective files for the 
OS.  however, when i did that, it had many errors, so do i need to have 
greater permissions possibly or did i just screw up, more likely?  if i 
can change the from box then i can get rid of this stupid hotmail 
account and just share the account i share with the others.  (i know how 
hotmail accounts are respected)  TIA!

p.s. what's so special about these sig-dashes?  is it etiquette or 
function?

My first guess would have been that someone hacked your account. But since
pine "is not working", I could also imagine that there is another session
of yours still running. Anyway, you should change your password. Simply
login and say "passwd", then follow the instructions.

Hope your son is any good at Unix ;-) 

1. Find out who is working with your account. Say:

      w | grep mitzi

2. Find out where this person comes from. Say:
   
      traceroute <the offender>

3. Have your sysadmin delve into the matter.

That's not a pine question. However, an Amiga 500 *is* a little
outdated, and you might consider getting a new computer.

No. That's not a bug, that's a feature of your provider's. Talk to
them. They might even give you another account.

HTH,

Subject: WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT PINE
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]
    

The messages from this mailing list are archived.  These archives can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/
       (includes a searchable index of all archived messages, and information
        on how to subscribe to this mailing list)

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/pine-info/.

     - From within Pine by defining a folder collection (from Pine's MAIN
       MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to folder-collections and 
       choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/pine-info/[]

Please note: the mailing list is no longer mirrored in the comp.mail.pine 
newsgroup.

If you have a question about Pine, chances are it has been asked before
and you can find the answer either through the searchable index of past
messages, or among the "Questions & Answers" at the URL: 

http://www.washington.edu/pine/QandA/ 
  or
ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/docs/QandA.txt

If you need personal assistance with using or configuring Pine, contact
the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large
number of Pine installations worldwide, the University of Washington
cannot provide individual support services to Pine users at other
organizations.)

Hello Pine,

I was wondering how I can delete the customized signature that I made?

Anyway, two things I'd like to see in Pine 4:

  1. Sigdashes made standard ("-- ")
  2. The equivalent of
     (setq message-cite-function
     'message-cite-original-without-signature)

The latter is especially handy and, <hint> if set globally, would keep
people from including signatures in replies.</hint>

Cheers,
Robin

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest
* Filters out duplicates
* Keeps track of URLs already visited
* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week
* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
 Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
 Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
 Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

You can also piss a lot of people off and cost a lot of
unneeded and unwanted expense by sending unwanted email and
by posting adds where they do not belong.
How's that for a BUll's Eye.

For the last one month my emails disappear after reading from the Inbox
folder eventhough not deleted by me.
Actually after reading the mail it remains in the folder for that day but
next day it just disappears and if there is no new mail the inbox shows 0
messages.
I don't know why this is happening. I am capturing the mails in a log so
it doesn't make much difference but  I still wonder why this problem has
cropped up all of a sudden. I have been using Pine for emails since
October 1995 and had no problem whatsoever.
Solutions and suggestions are welcome and will be appreciated.
Thanks 
Trupti

Go to your config setup and look at the item called
	Read-Message-Folder
If there is a folder name beside that (and I'll bet there
is) that is the folder where you will find all the
mysteriously disappearing messages.

For the last one month my emails disappear after reading from the Inbox

Actually after reading the mail it remains in the folder for that day but
next day it just disappears and if there is no new mail the inbox shows 0
messages.
I don't know why this is happening. I am capturing the mails in a log so
it doesn't make much difference but  I still wonder why this problem has
cropped up all of a sudden. I have been using Pine for emails since
October 1995 and had no problem whatsoever.
Solutions and suggestions are welcome and will be appreciated.

Since you have a VSNL account and if you are using any dial-up software,
at your unix prompt, type

sz /usr/spool/mail/<put your userid here>

This will download your mail to your computer and you won't have to
keep capturing it to any log or file.

I download all my mail daily this way and even have a program that renames 
the downloaded mail file to match the current date. 

I archive most of my mail this way.

Try looking in the MAIN MENU>SETUP>CONFIG.

When in there look for an item called 'enable-cruise-mode' and one called
'enable-cruise-mode-delete'.  See the help pages for these.  Be careful if
they are both turned on.  This will do what you are talking about.  
Also the e[X]punge (get rid of) function without a prompt could be a 
dangerous combination.  This will point you in the right direction.

is there any way to change the content-type in a header to text/html? I can
add it in the config feature list, but the "text/plain" won't go away.

thanks in advance.

The alias PINE-INFO-owner@u.washington.edu is actually set by the
ListProcessor, which runs a couple of hundred mailing lists from many
departments at the University of Washington, and I don't know if that's
changeable, but I'll check into it.  The alias
owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu *does* exist (but notice the different
subdomain), and I'll advertise the contact address better on the list's
info file and web page. 

When exactly did receiving the "slew of error messages from misconfigured
mail servers" start?

Don't send HTML in the body of an e-mail message. It's still plain text, and
properly marked as such. Send an attachment instead. btw, all attachments are
encoded Base-64, so you receipient must be able to handle it.

Hi there,
I don't know with whom should I contacr regarding my mail problems, I saw
from the Bug report that I can send the e.mail for rectifying the problem
therefore I am writing on the above said address.
I have a problem in my e.mail since app. 10 days, whenever I open the my
e.mail my all old mails get deleted by itself. I am also not getting all
the mails, because when I checked the e.mail through telnet I can get
many. 
Please do the needful to rectify the problem.
Thanking you in anticipation.

Is there any information on exactly how Pine determines where a line in a
message file (or "folder") is actually a message separator or just a line
in the email message.  I am interested in the "meat and potatoes" of how
the creators of Pine test to see if the line is actually a message
separator (pseudo-code, maybe?)

If you have any information, please contact me directly through email.

Thank you.

Hi,

Just wanted to pass along some info about a new piece of software 
I now call my "secret weapon."  It's amazing!  Listen to this...

Me and hundreds of others can now reach "millions of potential 
customers" - absolutely FREE!  A lot of us are creating immediate 
"cash flow explosions" - literally overnight!  And blowing our 
competition right out of the water!

You have to check this thing out.  To get some details, all you 
have to do is visit this web address:

http://www.powercontact.com

Take care. I'll talk with you later.

Sincerely,

Robin Lockett

Subject: Sug (ID DJ17Y): can't seem to get email

Ive noticed that i'm not receiving any email.  This problem started
probably a few days ago.  Many people have already emailed me, and let me
know of their email to me, yet i still never received them.  I know it's
not a case of them getting the wrong email address because i myself have
tried to send email to my account from another email address, yet i still
don't receive it.

Can u please tell me what's wrong?  If u actually can get back to me at
this address.  You can also email me at:  m_serrano@mailexcite.com.
I would actually prefer that in case you happen to email me at this
address and i don't receive it.

Thank You

Hello everybody.  A friend of ours sent us a virus alert today that I
thought I should share with you.  This alert was sent directly from
Microsoft and AOL so it should be taken seriously.  If you receive an
e-mail that says something like:
	WIN A FREE VACATION.  OPEN/READ ME IMMEDIATELY.

DO NOT OPEN THIS.  It is apparently a very bad virus that will immediately

It is just the same old hoax that has been going around for
years.  Don't worry about it.

Funny, I just opened an email addressed that way. Nothing bad happened. I am
running Pine 3.96 under Solaris 2.6. I also sent a note to postmaster@aol.com
that I did not appreciate his network being used to SPAM email lists I
subscribe to.

Darling:

1. Read the Netiquette.
2. Read it again so you'll have a chance to understand.
3. Make your signature according to son-of-RFC-1632 or something, ie
   o 4 lines max
   o "-- \n" at the beginning
   o Remember that thine sig shall not suck

Geez...

Listen, girls, this list is supposed to deal with technical problems

the only thing "virus like" about this "virus" is the way it spread. For
all practical purposes, you cannot get a virus from opening an email.
While their are "hostile" java scripts, because pine does not use java, it
is not prone to these problems. If you like, I can send you some links on
hoax viruses like this one and a neat humourous email about them.

Be advised that I've investigated the situation using America Onlines Terms of
Service Agreement (TOS) and basic Netiquette principles as a guide. I've taken
appropriate action on the member's account, however, due to reasons of confi-
dentiality, I am unable to disclose the nature of this action.

To prove this is a genuine message from the AOL postmaster, please note that
their sendmail is misconfigured. "Mike T." is not a trusted user.

Fortunately, I have the details of the action AOL took against the offending
account holder. He was reported to Naval Investigative Services as a suspected
homosexual.

gack!
nonononono!ascii art = bad

sig guidelines -- some sort of separator (some purists say two dashes and

No, Vinnie, it *is* important. See, Real MUAs(tm) can do this:

(setq message-cite-function 
      'message-cite-original-without-signature)

This means that if a signature is properly separated from the body, it
will not be included in the reply.[1] This is a nifty feature that pine
sorely lacks (sigs should *never* be included in a reply). Because of
people like you, Vinnie, poor guys like have to hack elisp, which can
be a real pain. The result is this:

;;* This one takes care of fscked-up signatures
(setq gnus-signature-separator
      '("^-- $"         ; The standard
	"^-- *$"        ; A common mangling
	"^-------*$"    ; Many people just use a looong 
			; line of dashes.  Shame!
	"^ *--------*$" ; Double-shame!
	"^________*$"   ; Underscores are also popular
	"^========*$")) ; Pervert!

Not really necessary, is it?

> then four lines or less of quote, info or other stuff.

Most of what you probably consider "info" actually belongs in the
X-header, eg your URL, your Attribution and the like.

Cheers,
Robin

Footnotes: 
[1]  It also gets highlighted by certain mailers, it can be suppressed,
     and my database scans it for addresses so I don't have to bother
     with killme@nospam-nobrain.gov and the like.

Unfortunetly, certain "modern" mail readers don't handle things in the
headers really well

of course, these are the same readers that are nicely and easily crashed
by java and html, so this may be easily fixable :>

and the idea that said mail readers care about sig dashes amuses me
muchly.

I don't like it, but I can't change it..
at least not until march 31st :) for netscape
face it, M$ products will never work right.

and since I deal with customers and cow-orkers all day who use the blasted
M$ products, it's a necessity for me.

Thank you.

How do I get header fields for priority and return receipts?

I have added two header fields to this mail which i think would work, but
they don't work all the time.
 
Thank you

P.S. 

There are no "working" newsservers, only badly protected ones.

Depends on what you call "transfer". If you mean "copy saved
attachment to disk", there certainly is a way, but you'd have to tell
us what Operating System you're working with.

	I have trouble getting my e-mail to print from Pine.  Every time I
try to print an e-mail message, my computer freezes up and doesn't print.
Actually, only Pine freezes up completely.  The printer icon reads that it
is "spooling" and never gets anywhere else.
	I am running Pine through Hyperterminal in Windows 95.  All my
other programs seem to print fine.  Is there a setting I need to change?
I'm at a standstill.  It is definitely a continuing problem.

RTFM, the problem-solving procedures for PC pine and printing are
described in the User's Guide on the pine website. IIRC, you need
another terminal emulation. Sorry, make that: you need _a_ terminal
emulation, because Hype Terminal is about as good as the OS it crawls
under. Ewan telnet is said to work.

Having read some of the Spam discussions, I have added a Reply-To item in
my Pine compose header and put "xxx@edmonds.wednet.edu" in it to defeat
spammers (they presumably use the Reply-To info to make bulk mailings). I
have asked others to sub my real logon for the "xxx" when using the
"r=reply" feature. 

Is there a way I can edit .pinerc on the Unix system here to automatically
fill in the "xxx@edmonds.wednet.edu" address after Reply-To: ?

Wonder if all this will do any good!

Thanks guys - I have learned a lot from reading the pine-ino listserv
stuff.

I'm not sure how, but an e-mail I received has become a READONLY file. I
have tried to delete it and expunge it, but to no avail. I have saved it
and deleted it, but the original still appears every time I log onto pine.
What can I do to get rid of this pesky e-mail? It is always "on top" every
time I log on and find a "mail" message.
Aloha,
Bob

May I politely interject here "braindead"?

    1. Fscking up your header is non-RFC conformant an a major breach of
       the Netiquette.

    2. Messing with your ID will hopefully earn you a swift kick in
       the butt from your postmaster because the messages will bounce
       to your domain. If you think you need to make yourself a jerk,
       fake the domain.

    3. Faking the reply-to is utterly senseless.

Please read Gandalf's Spam FAQ, will you?

> I have asked others to sub my real logon for the "xxx" when using

Please... :-/ You're on a Unix system - use procmail. Nancy McGough's
fabulous Filtering Mail FAQ explains how to do that.

No. The new version will (shame on the developers for that). Right
now, you have to recompile with the magic switch (to be found in the
tech-notes).

Darling, people like you make people like me do that:

(setq gnus-signature-separator
      '("^-- $"         ; The standard
	"^-- *$"        ; A common mangling
	"^-------*$"    ; Many people just use a looong 
			; line of dashes.  Shame!
	"^ *--------*$" ; Double-shame!
	"^________*$"   ; Underscores are also popular
	"^========*$")) ; Pervert!

Think about it and add "-- " as the first line of your signature, please.

This message is being sent to this mailing list weekly in order to
aid readers in finding information about Pine.  Before sending questions 
to the mailing list, please consult these resources:

The Pine program itself includes extensive internal, context-sensitive
help.  Additional information, including a User's Guide, Technical Notes, 
Questions & Answers, where to obtain the Pine software, what tools are 
available to perform tasks that Pine itself does not, and more, can be 
accessed:

     - In the Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
       http://www.washington.edu/pine/

     - Via anonymous FTP on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the
       subdirectory /pine/docs/. Here, you will find most of the
       documents from the Pine Information Center in plain-text form.

     - The Pine documents on the host ftp.cac.washington.edu can
       also be read from within Pine by defining a folder collection
       (from Pine's MAIN MENU, choose SETUP, Config; then move to
       folder-collections and choose Add Value) as:
            *{ftp.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}pine/docs/[]

the technical support staff or computer help desk of YOUR Internet Service
Provider, school, university, employer, ... -- whichever organization
provided you with the email account on which you are using, or planning on
using, Pine.  Because system functions and configuration can vary from
site to site, they are best qualified to assist you.  (Due to the large

Put the command in your login script, but the question really doesn't
belong here.

> P.S.: I could really use a good sendmail howto???

as much fun. Try using qmail instead.

i didn't even see a picture of you at that site 'Sandra'.  what i saw was a
gateway page to some porn sites. free sites like angelfire, geocities, and
tripod are intended to be used by individuals to have an oportunity to stake
thier claim to a piece of the net.....not for comercial purposes.  
something tells me that angelfire wouldn't be
overly impressed by you using thier resources as a gateway to porn. and even
less impressed at you spamming the list to get hits.  this is the second
message i've seen from you on this list.  i'd advise you to take your
advertisements elsewhere.  this is pine-info not porn-info.

Brian, don't expect anything that remotely resembles "sanity" emerging
from aol. It's a cesspool, run by individuals who themselves, have only
recently emerges from the primordial soup.
Th er...person sending the original post has an IQ that barely exceeds
that of a chimpanzee, though I hate to insult primates. What *does*
surprise me is that she can even boot her/his/it's computer!
I *do* recommend a visit to: http://www.aolsucks.org This isn't a
whimsical site, rather one that is dedicated to dissecting and revealing
the ridiculous, unethical and plain scandalous behavior of AOL management,
and their inability to run an Online service. I wish there was a companion
site aoluserssuck.org for the sake of balance, regrettably however, there
isn't. Perhaps the users themselves (wherever they emerge from beneath
their rocks of ignorance and stupidity) make the creation of such a site
unnecessary.
Well, that's my .002 worth this fine Monday morning, boy am I in a great
and positive frame of mind today or what!
-Colin.

I would like to set an auto response for my email while I'm away for a few

man procmail :)

btw (for anyone else who happens to care)-- a friend of mine has found one
patch to make procmail sort through your email box if you use pine and
IMAP (like me...wheee) looking for spammish things. and he wrote another
one that sorts mailing list messages into folders. He's got to find them
again though :(

Is there not a VACATION program on your Unix system? (I'm making the
assumption you're using such a system.)   Try doing a 'man vacation' -
IIRC it's pretty straightforward to set up.

In October, and briefly again in January, members of this mailing list
discussed the pros and cons of restricting posting to this list to
subscribers only.  At the risk of oversimplification, it appears that the
"pro" is reduction, if not elimination, of Unsolicited Commercial Email
(UCE) distribution to present and future list subscribers via the list, and
the "con" is possible confusion for new email users writing to the list for
help. 

Since the ListProcessor for this mailing list, if set to subscriber-only
posting, will send non-subscribers trying to post to it a reply message
instructing them to subscribe first; the delineation between the respective
purposes of comp.mail.pine and pine-info should now be fairly well
documented and established; and UCE to the list continues unabatedly, it
seems that the "pro" outweighs the "con."  Therefore, we are planning on
setting this mailing list to accept postings only by subscribers effective
Monday, April 6, 1998.

HA HA HA!
Do you have *any* idea of what you just asked? Can you comprehend the
absolute impossibility (never mind the privacy issues for now) of what you
asked? Sure, I'll send you a 2GB text file, no problem, if I had it that
is.
Oh..yeah, the privacy issue.
Everyone out there...Sena Gursoy wants to know who you are, what your
email address is...and then he's gonna shut down the entire Internet
overnight after he does a mondo-spam to beat all spams...oh yeah, he's a
politics major too, so please supply your email address so he can send
you political tracts..or alter your mind, or.......
Go away Sena, read "The Internet, it's origins and growth" by Peter L.
Markham...better still read the "Netiquette" pages and ask yourself why
you actually *want* millions of email addresses. Can't be for anything
that's above board.

Hello, David "PC" Miller,

It's always good to see that some people practise what they preach, in
this case obeying the netiquette. But...

	 ======================== 8< ========================
When quoting another person, edit out whatever isn't directly applicable
to your reply. Don't let your mailing or Usenet software automatically
quote the entire body of messages you are replying to when it's not
necessary. Take the time to edit any quotations down to the minimum
necessary to provide context for your reply. Nobody likes reading a long
message in quotes for the third or fourth time, only to be followed by a
one line response: "Yeah, me too."
	 ======================== 8< ========================

and this one:

	 ======================== 8< ========================
Include your signature at the bottom of Email messages when communicating
with people who may not know you personally or broadcasting to a dynamic
group of subscribers.  Your signature footer should include your name,
position, affiliation and Internet and/or BITNET addresses and should not
exceed more than 4 lines.  Optional information could include your address
and phone number.

I suppose it's got something to do with the rather unappealing amount
of UCE this list has seen over the past few weeks.

Later,
Robin

Indeed, the degree of comfort with making the list subscriber-only-posting
increases as the number of pointers "out there" telling Pine-users to write
to pine-info decreases.  Furthermore, this change will also obsolete the
whole 

"If you are sending a question to the Pine-Info mailing list but do not
subscribe to it, request in your message that replies be sent directly to
you, with a copy to the list. (Conversely, if you are answering a question
in the Pine-Info mailing list, be sure to include the inquirer's email
address in your reply, since s/he may not be a subscriber and will
otherwise not see your answer)."

Hello pine-info

Please pardon this intrusion.  I have selected your email address by a targeted search, but I can't select 
everyone who wants to be my customer.  If you are uninterested in my offer, do nothing except scroll 
down and get the free information I offer.  I will do everything in my power to assure you will be excluded 
from future mailings.  This is a one-time mailing. 

The Stuff THEY Don't Want YOU to Know About... 

Are you tired of paying for this... 

Computer applications 
Computer games 
Postage 
CD Quality Music - not wavs, real audio(ram), midi, mod, or etc. 
Web Space, Site Promotion, & Email 

THEN DON'T!!! 

+PLUS+ 
Loads of hacking, phreaking, and etc. info 
The ULTIMATE mailbomb - how to send a mailbomb that never stops and is untraceable 
How to get a brand new credit file 
Sponsors for your webpage like NETRADIO  - and more up to $.35 a click through 
How to sell ANYTHING on the internet and how to advertise it 
How to set up your own 1-900# business for about $100 
FBI, COTHERN, DEA, Military, Customs, and other secret scanner frequencies and callsigns too 
Unique trade directory -  learn where to buy laser guns(burning, cutting), magnetic gauss guns, mind 
powered devices, vortex generators, surveillance devices, slot machine jackpotters, and other hard to find 
but useful items 
How to easily make Colloidial Silver for pennies per gallon - Colloidial Silver is known to kill over 650 
pathogens and is beneficial to people.  It costs about $16 for an 8 oz. bottle in stores. 
How to make alcohol - complete instructions 
The NSA(National Security Agency) handbook 
Directory of people finding services 
How to build a Magnetic Card(Credit card, ATM card, Hotel Keys, & etc.) Copier 
Where to buy software at super discount prices - completely legal to buy and resell.  I'll give you the 
location where you can buy a catalog for $5 + $3 shipping and handling with hundreds of popular 
software titles. 
How and where to get UNLISTED PHONE NUMBERS - like the ones most companies charge $20 - $200 to 
find. 
How to get free energy, make a Tesla Coil, and other wierd science topics -  You'll learn how to build a 
simple free energy device that can run a generator.  It is a large project and requires welding experience, 
though.  You can also easily make a Tesla coil for under $40, and all parts are easily obtainable/buildable, 
too.  And, there are several small projects that you can build in under 10 minutes that violate natural law.  
These require very little electrical or building experience. 

It has taken me over three years of searching to learn this much, but you can know it all in less than a 
minute! 

In my report of seldomly found information, you will learn how to get everything above absolutely free and 
learn about the topics I listed.  I've placed my info on a secret webpage of which you can learn the link by 
dialing a 1-900 number.  The topics of my report are always expanding with new material.  Think of it as a 
members only site with a $7.95 lifetime membership! 

Here are just a few of the thousands of programs you can learn how to download free through my report: 

Adobe Photoshop 4 + HUNDREDS of plugins and lots more adobe stuff 
Visual Basic 4 & 5 
Win95 
MS Office 97 
Corel programs 
Warcraft 1 & 2 + add ons 
Command & Conquer 1, 2, & 3 
Quake 1 & 2 
Maxis's Sim stuff - Just about all of  them 
Tombraider 1 & 2 
Frontpage 98 + cracker 
Internet Phone 
Web Browsing & Authoring Software 
TONS of Mcafee stuff 
System Commander 3.01 
Hundreds more! 
 

These programs are not demos and will not deactviate after a period of time.  They are full versions. 

+PLUS+ thousands of titles of the latest, rock, oldies, heavy metal, classical, country, and lots more CD 
quality music.  And, I'll tell you exactly where to download the player. 

This is well over $1000 worth of software, and that's just part of my $7.95 report.  I just looked through a 
couple of sites that my report tells you about and listed some of the software they link to(Direct downloads 
that are continuosly updated).  Also, the sites I reveal have serial numbers and cracker programs to almost 
every piece of software on the planet(Shareware too), so you can unlock full versions. 
 
To pay for the report, all you must do is is call 1 900 562 3733. The call is a one time fee of $7.95.  When 
you call, you will hear the web address of my report.  It is repeated several times so that you have plenty 
of time to write it down.  Type it into your browser, and then you're all set!  Now, isn't that better than 
waiting to send payment through the mail and waiting for me to send the report to you?!?! 

If the operator says "the call can't be completed as dialed" or something, you might have a 900# block.  You 
will not be charged. 
 

HERE ARE THE FREEBIES! 

As a sample of my info and good intentions, here is the link to that treasured government auction list that 
everyone is selling nowadays.  Can you believe it?  All you had to do was go to the Department of Justice 
home page! 
http://www.usdoj.gov/marshals/nsl.html 
 
 

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME! 

My report is sold for informational purposes only.  Buy buying this item, you assume all responsibility for 
your actions.  I take no responsibility whatsoever for any illegal actions you participate in.  Also, I make no 
guarantee of the availability of certain programs.  The ones above I have commonly seen in the past, and 
they will most likely be available for download always.

I have been using Pine for about 1 full year now and I have not had one
problem until now. It was working great today as usual until around
11:00pm. I logged in to find that all of my folders were gone, and I
couldn't even access "Inbox", the only folder left. Pine displayed at the
bottom of the screen that it couldn't open because it was not an ISAM
message. It also had "MAIL-E-NOTISAM" at the bottom left hand corner of my
screen. I would be overjoyed to save all of my old folders. Most of my
mails that I save are very important. I appreciate any help that can be
recieved.




						Sincerely,

						Norman B. Mills

Hello Everybody,
     I would like to applaud the suggestion which was recently made that
people edit their posts to cut out extraneous material.
     Some of you might recall an earlier appeal I made asking folks if
they could say what they had to say and then quote since I am using speech
and this would be much easier for me and other people using adaptive
equiptment.
     Robin's suggestion helps us all.
      He wrote:
...When quoting another person, edit out whatever isn't directly
applicable
to your reply. Don't let your mailing or Usenet software automatically
quote the entire body of messages you are replying to when it's not
necessary. Take the time to edit any quotations down to the minimum
necessary to provide context for your reply. Nobody likes reading a long
message in quotes for the third or fourth time, only to be followed by a

  one line response: "Yeah, me too.
""
     Thank you,
Margaret
