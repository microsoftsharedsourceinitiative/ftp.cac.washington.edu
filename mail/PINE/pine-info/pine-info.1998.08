I'm sending this off now that I'm an official member of the group.  I have
asked my local pine helper and he suggested I contact you.  My
problem is that since I've installed Windows 98 I seem to have a text
wrap-around problem (or some variation of it).  As I screen through my
messages partial lines of text remain on the right margin (jagged) in
reverse (i.e., white on black) characters.  I submitted this to the W98
people and they said to contact my software vendor (I guess that's you).
So, any suggestions as to how to get rid of this annoying problem?
Thanks, in advance.

Subject: PINE tries to "CREATE INBOX" on IMAP4rev1 servers
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello all,

I'm having a little trouble using PINE with IMAP4rev1... basically I
try to add an IMAP4rev1 server to my "collection list" and if I don't
specify a Path: (which should be legal operation, this should cause PINE
to work in the user's default folderspace) I get an error because PINE
tries to CREATE the folder INBOX... which is specifically mentioned in
RFC2060 as causing an error.

And since an error is returned by the server, PINE refuses to save that
collection.

So shouldn't PINE be checking for the special value of "INBOX" and avoid
creating a folder of that name on an IMAP4rev1 server?
		Mike

In our LDAP server (UM slapd 3.3) we encode ISO-8859-1 characters in
UTF-8, which should be the proper thing to do with LDAPv3.  When Pine
4.02 retrieves records containing non-US-ASCII characters, these are not
decoded properly.  Instead, they are displayed directly as two separate
characters.  As an example (if you can't view ISO-8859-1 characters, the
following will look truly weird!), the Danish letter "=F8" (quoted-
printable representation =3DF8) is encoded in the database as the
two-character sequence =3DC3=3DB8.  When Pine retrieves, say, the record
containing information about yours truly, the given name appears as
"S=C3=B8ren".  This may not seem like the-end-of-civilization-as-we-know-it
to American readers, but given the frequence with which 8-bit characters
appear in European names, a bug fix would be very much appreciated.

Sincerely,
S=F8ren Larsen

Dear Sir,

I am your subscriber and I am here for help.

My pine version is : 3.96

Problems encountered :

1) End or Home button is not supported by the pine software.
2) Can we have a spell check ?
3) We do not have a proper cut and paste facility.In the "Edit" option
there is "Select All" which in reality does not select all the text. It
simply selects the text on the page which is displayed on the monitor.
e.g For an instance we have got 3 pages in a file. We want to copy all the
3 pages, it would not copy all 3, but it would copy only 1 page.

Sumit

(I received a response with the answer so here it is....)

----------
No, that was not a bad assumption.  However, termdef-takes-precedence is
an option for "feature-list=", so all you have to do is add it there (and
don't forget to add a "," to the item that is currently the last one!).

Good luck!

Subject: Managing mailboxes...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hi, all.

I'd like to try out Pine for a while, but before I can give it a serious go,
I need to figure out how to do something that's default behaviour with Mutt.

I use procmail to sort out my mail into different mailboxes for me. I name
mailboxes that receive mail such that they appear at the top of the list in
Mutt. When I've deleted the last message in a particular mailbox, Mutt
deletes the mailbox itself. This is what I'd like to do in Pine.

My reason for wanting to do this is this: If I've defined a collection of
mailboxes in Pine that can receive mail, I occasionally like to skip around
between them. Using the tab key as a shortcut would be nice if it didn't
skip over mailboxes that I've looked at but haven't yet read and expunged
completely. Manually picking a new mailbox also isn't quite acceptable, since
there's no way to know what mailboxes are empty and what mailboxes have new
mail.

I can do all this in Mutt, but Pine is sort of intriguing, and it wouldn't
take a whole lot for me to happily switch. (If nothing else, my impression
is that it's easier to integrate Pine with PGP than it is to do the same
thing with Mutt... Of course, I may be wrong about this, and messages that
describe sleek ways of getting Mutt to do signatures-in-the-body on demand
as opposed to just doing MIME-based attachment-style signatures and ways to
get Mutt to decode and verify both styles of PGP-signed message are welcome.
I'd be just as happy to give Pine a whirl, though, all that aside.)

Thanks in advance for information.

I asked about this not 2 weeks ago.  Didn't hear a thing.

I've not had time to hack the code further.

Can someone make collection behavior uniform?  This differentation b/t the
inbox collection and all others is stupid.

Subject: Pine segfaults with a MIME attached HTML file
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Authentication-Warning: sean.compu-aid.com: sean owned process doing -bs
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

Hello,

I have just joined this list after exhausing my search for an official bug
report address for Pine.

First, some obligatory system info: Pine 4.02 running on RHL 5.1, all
updates applied, glibc 2.0.7, kernel 2.0.35.  Tried Pine from RPM, SRPM,
and from original tarball.

Yesterday a coworker of mine emailed me a MIME attached HTML file.  Upon
trying to read the mail that this file was attached to Pine exited with:

	Problem detected: "Received abort signal".
	Pine Exiting.

The email that I was trying to read was written and sent from Netscape
Communicator Professional 4.05.  The HTML file was exported from MS Word
97 and, as anyone who has ever seen MS Word-exported HTML knows, looks
absolutley hideous.  My feeling is that Pine is unable to deal with some
aspect of the MS Word HTML.  Even if that is the case though, I don't
think Pine should crash upon opening it.

I compiled Pine with the debug symbols and ran it in gdb.  Upon trying to
open the offending message gdb came up with the following:

(gdb) file ./pine
(gdb) run

[pine runs and I open the message]

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x80da2e2 in mail_view_screen (ps=0x8258618) at mailview.c:455         
455     for(hp = handles; !scroll_handle_selectable(hp); hp = hp->next)      

[garbage left on the screen from Pine removed]

I'm no gdb expert (first time I've used it, in fact) so I hope that's
enough information to be useful.

The HTML document was originally rather long but after a few hours of
trial and error I narrowed it down to just a handful of lines that still
cause Pine to crash.  I was going to UUENCODE the mail folder it was it
(it was moved to it's own) and attach it but I don't yet have permission
from my boss to release the edited-for-public-release version.  If anyone
wants to see the offending HTML let me know and I will try to make it
available (with the names and faces changed to protect the innocent <g>).

Any thoughts on this one?  Is this the right place to be reporting this?
I'd love to work with someone on this to get this problem fixed.

Thanks in advance.

Best,
Sean

I installed PC-Pine on my NT 4.0 Workstation and have it running

workstations, and they get a Host Not Found error #11002.  It works
perfectly on NT, but can't find the host on any win95 machine.  I can
telnet, ping, etc, but no PC-Pine.  I searched the UW website without
finding anything.  Is PC-Pine looking for a specific network setting
that telnet & ping wouldn't use (thus might not be configured)?

Any ideas?

Chris,

I had a similar problem, and the solution was to install the imapd
on my Unix server.  If you have already done so, you can see if it's
running properly by telnetting into it (port 143).  If you get a 
response of:

* OK <server-name>...

then you should be OK.  If not, check your Unix server for errors in
starting the daemon.

Good luck!

The Imap server works fine with PC-Pine on NT, or Netscape, or Microsoft
Outlook (Gasp!).  Just not PC-Pine under win95.  I copied my pc-pine
"pinerc" file and everything to the win95 machine.  No luck.

Here's the end of my pinedebug log.

Aha!  Your host was not found...may I suggest you enter the host in the
host file of the PC, or if you're running DNS, tell your PC which host is
the DNS server.  Look for the file hosts.sam on your PC if you're not running
DNS, and create a file from it called hosts (no tail, same directory).  
Enter your hostname and IP address seperated by a tab.

I'm not at home right now, but I had pc-pine working great under win95 and
now win 98. I'll try to remember to look at my settings when I get home.

  How can I find out all of the recipients that is already imbedded in
the reply to: section of the e-mail. None are shown except who the e-mail
was last sent by, as the recipient.  Yet I am asked if I want to reply to
all recipients.  And there are some that I would not like my reply read
by. I want to edit who is the recipients without having to compose
new e-mailings to and attach addresses to it....  Is there a thread or
path command that will show me the history of the e-mail itself.  Where it
has been and if I reply where it is going.
thabk you  kboletus

The DOS version does keep the passwords, but the unix versions
don't.  I had reason to keep the password for unix also, 
so I hacked the source code for pine 3.96 in the appropriate spots,
and made the password file be group readable.

 look for code with
   #if defined(DOS) || defined(OS2)
 around or near code that matches /passwd/

in pine/ imap.c

also in init.c near "user-id"

I also made some changes in os.c and send.c

Pine 4.02 binary running on Solaris 2.6 aborts when confronted with a
search of the "To:" field in a large folder.  It does not fail when all
text is searched!  So this is a definite bug because it did not do this in
Pine 3.96 searching exactly the same folders.

So it's using Select, Text, To.  In a large enough directory.

Ok, this was odd enough...  I was using the IP number in the pinerc which
worked under NT, but under win95 it was reporting Host Not Found.  So,
just for kicks, I set pinerc to the full name (not the IP) and let the PC
do a DNS lookup.  This worked.  

Anyone know why PC-Pine 3.96 would do this?  At least I have a solution.

It has recently come to our attention that the current Pine release,
version 4.02, is susceptible to some of the same MIME-header overflow
vulnerabilities that have been discovered in various other mail user
agents.

While we're aware of no specific attacks that exploit these problems, we
are making the following patch available which will help reduce the
chances that such an attack will be successful.

While we've taken every precaution to ensure that this small set of
changes introduce no new instability, as with any new release, please
verify that this is the case in your environment.

A more complete patch description can be found in:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine4.02A.patch.readme

The patch itself is available from:

        ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pine4.02A.patch

This file is also available via the Pine Information Center at: 

        http://www.washington.edu/pine/

As always, Thanks for your interest and enjoy!

Sincerely,

The Pine Development Team

I've never added a patch to Pine, so I apologize for my ignorance.... I do
not seem to have the "patch utility" used to apply the patch.  I would
assume this was a compiler utility, no?  Any ideas?

Hello, 
      I'm having trouble ever since I downloaded and upgraded to pine4.02.
I'm running RedHat 5.0 with shadowed passwords. I downloaded the source
and compiled it with the 'build slx'.
	Ok, the problem I am having is that I can't forward messages or
reply with the original text included.
	Whenever I compose a message from new or reply without adding the
original text, the message is sent just fine.
	When I forward a message I get the message on the bottom saying
"sending mail 100%" but thats it. and after a about 15 seconds I get
another message stating "Waiting for server reply.  Still waiting"  and
after 60 seconds its asks if I want to beak the connection.
	
	Do I have something misconfigured somewhere? Has anyone
experienced this before?

	Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance, 
Sam

"patch" is a utility.  You can pick up the source at the following location:

Subject: Returning to a folder
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

We recently upgraded from pine 3.96 to 4.02 on our Linux (2.0.33) system.

Is there any setting I can make to get a folder to remember which message
is the current one?

When I leave a folder (other than INBOX) and later in the same pine
session return to it, I would like to be pointing at the same message as
when I left.  Instead, the selection ">" is always moved to the last
message in the folder.  The INBOX folder is different: when I come back to
it the ">" is where I left it.

It does not seem to matter whether the folder was created by pine 4.02 or
by pine 3.96. Our folders are in standard unix format (pine's default, I
assume). I have not quelled the folder-internal messages or done anything
else extraordinary.  My folders other than INBOX are in ~/mail (~/mbox is
INBOX).  Besides, I don't expect pine to remember the selection position
from one pine session to the next, only during one session.

I have two folder collections (my local messages and my newsgroups).

------ User complaint that I'm responding to....

   I have a problem with pine.  when you do an index it used to take you
to yer last read message.  It o longer does this, rather it puts you back
at the 1st message.

------ End user complaint...

Has anyone used dmail with procmail?

If so, would you share examples of how they fit together?  I've been
using procmail with standard unix mail folders, and would like to use it
with mbx format folders, and have gotten the impression that I should
use dmail (or so the dmail man page sez).  If I'm wrong here, that would
be good to know, too.

In actual fact the UNIX version, in most setups, does not need to store the
password because a better and more secure system is available instead:
namely use of the standard "rsh" mechanism.

The "rsh" command allows one UNIX system to connect to another (suitably
configured) system and either start a shell or execute a command string ...
all without having to supply a username or password.

This is possible when the target system has been told it can trust
connections originating from one or more source machines.  The rsh
mechanism itself sorts out the username side, and the fact it is using
privileged ports implies that the connection information has to come from a
privileged program and hence can be trusted.

So for consenting UNIX systems this is what you have to do...

1.  Set up your IMAP server software to allow "pre-authenticated"
connections...  This is done very simply, just by creating a symbolic link
from /etc/rimapd to point to your real imapd executable.

2.  Set up your IMAP server machine's rsh mechanism to trust connections
for you/everyone on the client machine(s).  At a personal level this can be
done by setting up a ".rhosts" file in your home directory; at a systemwide
level it can be done with a "/etc/hosts.equiv" file.  See these man pages
for further information:
	man rsh       (the remote shell command: not the restricted shell page)
	man rshd
	man hosts.equiv
	man rhosts
If you are not familiar with the rsh mechanism do seek advice from your
local support centre: setting it up incorrectly can open up security holes.

3.  Start Pine.  By default it will attempt to open a pre-authenticated
rsh-based connection and execute the /etc/rimapd command before falling
back to an unauthenticated TCP/IP connection to port 143 (which will then
require you to enter a username and password).

As you can see this mechanism avoids the need to have passwords stored
anywhere.

Systems Administrators should note that setting up rsh access in this way
will allow users to execute any command or start a shell session on the
server.  If this is a problem then you should consider setting the shell of
users on the servers to some restricted program that only allows limited
commands to be used (in particular the /etc/rimapd program).

Cheers,

Mike B-)

as a security nut, i have a problem with rsh and 'trusted' unix
partners [hosts]... i do not use IMAP, so maybe i am off base;
however, with POP3 i use fetchmail for each user to get his mail off
the server. and sending mail is accomplished with sendmail. 

why? bacause my firewall does not allow ANY incoming traffic that is
not a result of an outgoing request [like from fetchmail]. yes, it
does take more admin effort. but is your security worth it? mine is.

Yes, but we don't connect to a UNIX based imap server.  Rather MS
Exchange.  Any ideas to make Pine retain the password for the Exchange
environment?  Thanks for your reply.

Thanks Ed, but I'm on the procmail list, and unless there's a problem
between here and Germany, it's been pretty moribund for a while now.

On the other hand, dmail (which is what I'm interested in) is part of
the imap-utils toolkit from UoW.  I thought of asking Mark directly, but
hoped to get some insight from this group first.  I also thought of
asking the imap-l list, but that's more related to imap development, not
usage.  Also, a search of the procmail archives (okay, the dejanews
archives) turned up nothing in that group.

Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile suggestion and I'll give it a try.

I'm having problems with Pine 4.02 on Digital UNIX 3.2D and 4.0B.  If you use ;
to start a selection, choose "T" for text, "T" for "to", and type any string,
the program will stop with a "Received abort signal" error and it will dump
core.  Now I can't duplicate this behavior when I'm using another mail folder
than INBOX and it doesn't seem to happen with a small number of messages.  Any
ideas would be greatly appreciated.

At which point he would have received a confirmation email with

I heard from Mark Crispin and he says that what I encountered was a known bug
that was correctible by replacing the imap toolkin in Pine 4.02 with the
imap-4.3.BETA version and rebuilding.  Worked like a charm!

     <underline>What is happening:</underline> 

	BSDI SMTP Mail Server- When (one) client with Eurdora Pro tries to check
her (long existing - never a prob before) mail, she gets response:	


    "There has been an error transferring your mail.

     I said: Pass <<Shhh! Don't tell anyone>

     And then the POP server (sscott@mail.jtbusa.com) said:

     ERR unable to process From lines (envelopes), chan"	 


 A little later a (network disconnnect) Error 10054 comes up, and the
Password mail login dialogue window shortly after that (set on 15 minute
mail checking)


For everyone else the mail is functioning normally in every way.


     <underline>What Operating System:

</underline>

	Mail Server is BSDI 3.0 - Unix, (client is Win 95)


     <underline>Browser version: 

</underline>

	Netscape 4.0


     <underline>Behind a firewall or a proxy server?</underline> 


Yes, we use a TIS Gauntlet Firewall, but she is trying to access the mail
from INSIDE, and has not been able to pull even the internal mail. 
Everyone else's mail is normal 


Hers has been fine for a long time also.  Her Eudora Pro settings have
not changed, and she has no filters running.


Interestingly, when I PINE in to her mail from the Unix Mail Server,
instead of the "In Folder" opening, it starts trying to open it, and then
says:


	"Problem detected "Out of free storage" !!?!

	PINE Exiting

	Abort trap (core dumped)


I went back to forward her mail to the new account, and there was no
response - characters would not even type!  Still processing from PINE!?!
 Then suddenly:

	You have new mail:


This is what interests me:  the "From:" says:

	People Daily (e-mail only) <<the daily@PATHFINDER.COM>


The original error in Eudora when checking mail was:

	"ERR unable to process From lines (envelopes), chan"


Now, I know that they must spam-mail a zillion people, but

I wonder still if the Eudora client is not seeing those parentheses as a
command (regarding envelopes?), but I have found nothing in any FAQ about
this error or theory.   


The /etc/login.conf file has settings for resource limits, but I am not
sure how to change this for just this one user with (apparently) a
"problem" file.  If I change the settings so Pine will work, I can delete
this file.


PINE is working fine for other users accounts.


Unfortunately, our UNIX specialist just left the company. 

Is anyone fluent in the advised limits and formats?

Does anyone have a better suggestion?  I have not been able to figure out
how to delete this one file, without knowing the exact date it arrived
(about a week ago), size or being able to keep PINE running long enough
to delete it.


Thanks to all who consider this problem,

Admittedly I work on a different platform, but I've found that usually
when this happens, it's because the first line of ^A^A^A^A (that would be
control-A *NOT* caret-A) is missing, or there is junk before it in the
pop file. I don't know if this is the case for you, but it probably
wouldn't hurt to open the POP file (or have the sysadmin for said system
do the same) and check for that...

   We recently had this problem too, with 3.96 (not quite ready to test
4.x yet) - and what it ended up being was that we had a ulimit for users
that was too low. Aparently, pine copies the entire mail spool file into
memory before doing anything with it. I would check this first, before
delving into the pine internals.

Hope it helps.

Hello.

Excuse the bad English.
We had been worked with pine 3.96 for AIX 3.2 on a rs/6000 server running AIX
3.2.5 and we are satisfied.
Recently we had obtained the file pine-bin.aix4.2 from ftp.cac.washington.edu
to run it on a risc/6000 server running AIX 4.2.1. Pine performs well
apparently, but when we try to send a message (Ctrl-X command), the message
"sending 0%" appears and the terminal turns locked. From another terminal we
can see running the Pine and sendmail processes. These jobs never end and we
kill them.
The sendmail works well individually.
Can anybody help us? Please, it's urgent.
If more information is needed, please tell us.
Any post or e-mail will be greatly appreciated

Best Regards.

Hi all,

I have the following message when I try to send a mail :

[>SMTP hello failure:421  SMTP connection went away!<]

If I send a mail using "mail", it works, If I'm connected
remote to this alpha and when I use Pine, it works also.

What is wrong ??
TIA

JEAN

I suspect that 
smtp-server is not defined in your configuration file
try setting it via the Config/Setup command.  Better yet,
ask your sysadmin to set it globally in the pine.conf file.

I'm running Pine 4.02A and was able to set up a basic URL viewer by just putting
Netscape in there.  However, I didn't like having it create a new window and
having to answer the "You're already running Netscape, do you want to continue"
question.  Soooo, Netscape allows you to send commands to another running
Netscape.  From a shell prompt I can type

	netscape -remote 'openURL(http:www.dickinson.edu)'

and my running browser flips to our college home page.  If I modify my
configuration so that it looks like this:

	url-viewer=netscape -remote 'openURL(_URL_)'

it still tries to open a new browser.  It doesn't even work if I hardcode a real
URL in there.  What am I missing here?  Thanks in advance.

You need to put double quotes (") around the entire command, then should 
work.  I've got mine set to  (including quotes!)

  "/usr/local/bin/netscape -noraise -remote 'openURL ( _URL_ ,new-window)'"

Good luck!

Your problem can be solved by creating a wrapper
shell script.

There are other problems that I though I reported
before, but have not been fixed when shell specific special
characters are present in the URL.  (like '&')

There seems to be no way to quote the URL to the shell.
  (I think that there were some good intentions
   that never got implemented in this area)

Thanks VERY much for this example -- When I read the pine 4.00 docs
this wasn't clear, and it would probably be helpfull if
this example would be added to the online help.

It also helped me with embedded ampersands in urls.

Hi !

Is there a possibility to start Pine, when I press on a <a
href="mailto:blabla">-Tag in Netscape, to start pine and not the
Netscape Messanger ?

I have a user who dials in to a unix system via W-98 with Reflections II.
Basic unix commands work, but when she tries to start Pine, she gets an
error message that her terminal is lacking functions to run Pine.  Tried
vt-101 emulator, etc.  Is this a common problem?  Is there a setup item
we're missing.  Thanks.  Dennis.

thanks to jeff liebermann and rsi... i was having fits with pine
on sco unix and jeff recommended anzio. i am using it on win/95
win/98 and win/nt both dialup and in place of telnet!

<stepping off soapbox>
vt100 should work. have them log into unix and at shell prompt
have them type:  echo $TERM
my guess is that it not really being set to vt100.

if it is, then the unix termcap/terminfo is not robust
enough with regard to vt100 feature set. try vt220 which
anzio again does very well.  is it reflectionX ??? i never
heard of reflection II. anzio lite for 32bit is $25.

hope this helps.

I would check which terminal both sides think they are running -- I ran
into this problem with windows 95 telnet and a linux box -- I could telnet
in, but pine wouldn't run, even with vt102 on the 95 side -- eventually I
figured out that it was something about the "linux" term type (I
think..this was some time ago) that it didn't like, and setting TERM=vt100
worked..

so..in sh or bash, you can

echo $TERM
if it comes back something other than vt10* (or even if it does and you
are feeling like experimenting) you can do

TERM=vt100
export TERM

then try running pine...I don't know if it'll work..I know nothing of
reflections, but it seemed similar enough to my problem to mention :)

Is this done by editing the pinerc, or is this somehow set within pine?

Jim,
  Thanks for pointing this one out. It will be fixed in 4.03. I've
attached a context diff for adrbklib.c if you want to fix it.

Hey, guys.

Recently 'upgraded' to Pine 4.00, and have found that news reading is
totally hosed. Has this been fixed yet, and if not, any idea when it's
going to be?

Workarounds, anyone?

        I'm having trouble ever since I downloaded and upgraded to pine4.02.
  I'm running RedHat 5.0 with shadowed passwords. I downloaded the source
  and compiled it with the 'build slx'. Everything is working fine except
  for one problem.
  	 The problem I am having is that I can't forward messages or
  reply with the original text included.
  	Whenever I compose a message from new or reply without adding the
  original text, the message is sent just fine.
  	When I forward a message I get the message on the bottom saying
  "sending mail 100%" but thats it. and after a about 15 seconds I get
  another message stating "Waiting for server reply.  Still waiting"  and
  after 60 seconds its asks if I want to beak the connection.
  	
  	Do I have something misconfigured somewhere? Has anyone
  experienced this before?
  
  	Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
  
  Thanks, 
  Sam

Does anyone know if 3.96 will permit the user to *elect* at composition
time, which signature file is used? Let's say an account is used for
business *and* personal use (mine is, for sure!) and the user may not want
a colorful personal sig to appear in a business-related communication.
Sooo...what was in my head was the possibility of an option that appears
as the compose screen comes up, like (say)..
Use default signature? second signature? neither? (options might be "d"
for default, (s) for second, (n) for neither)
Come to think of it, does that option exist in *any* version of Pine? (My
"other" ISP has 4.02 installed)
If not, is there some way this could be hacked?
Umm, just a brain-dump....not terribly well written. *Much* too tired for
carefully thought out composition.
TIA
-Colin

I've just figured out the solution to a problem I had been having with
Pine 4.02A. Pine would crash with a SIGSEGV when it tried to view
certain messages. The problem turned out to be that our
/usr/local/etc/mailcap file had incorrect permissions (it was not world
readable). This should be a non-fatal error, yes? It's late and I
haven't tried to track it down far enough to come up with a patch, but I
thought I'd go ahead and make everyone aware of it.

I believe the answer is no, but please enlighten me.  What I do is have
sig files with single letter names in my home directory, then I do a
^R
<file name><enter>
So the total effort is 4 key strokes.  While a built-in solution would be
nice, this is sufficiently easy for me.

HELP .......!


Is there a way that the size of personal address
books can be adjusted on a global scale
(ie., in pine.conf.fixed) eg, number of recipients per address
book is fixed, or largest size is a few hundred bytes etc.?  

If this is not possible, is their at least a method whereby 
the "listmode L" option can be disabled (when building
a personal address book from a global address book)?

The problem is that the size of our global address
book is something of the order 5,000 entries, and
too many of our users go to listmode and then 
hit 'X' 'down-arrow' , 'X' 'down-arrow' ...... ad infinitum!
till they form humongous lists which cause havoc
to our mail delivery system.
Thanks
Joe

It sounds like what you really need is a user policy that prohibits this
combined with a policing practice to find those who do this.  This is
considered a mail-bomb on our site and we have a script (attached) that
reads the sendmail log and people on or off site that sent over 50
messages in an hour.

   Dear Sir,

   I do not know why this has been sent to me. My query was different.
   I need to know how to get the original font in telnet.

Hi,

There was a request to restore the old, more space-efficient way to
way to display e-mails.

This patch adds a new configuration option, 'pack-address-headers'.
when the option is unset, pine writes one address pro line,
when the option is   set, pine packs as many addresses as possible
                           pro line.

This option comes in handy when the correspondents neglected to use
a mailing list manager :-)


Please consider including this patch in the next revision of pine.

Best thanks for all the work,
	Denis N. Antonioli

Subject: Printing Mail 
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


With versions of Pine prior to 4.0, email messages printed without
wrapping the lines.  If I sent a mail message with line lengths of 132
columns, these lines did not wrap at column 80 when printed.  With
version 4.0 and later, the printing automatically wraps at 80~ columns.
Is there any way to disable this wrapping?

We forward numerous reports that are formatted for 132 column printers
via email.  Our remote locations then print them on their 132 column
printers as needed.  The new version has really tangled me up on this
item.

I have noted that if I send the file as an attachment, it will print
properly.

I'm having a problem installing Pine 4.02 on a Unisys U6000 running SVR4
Unix.  I'm attaching a piece of the install screen where the problem is
displayed.  Any help or info would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

I'm having a problem installing Pine 4.02 on a Unisys U6000 running SVR4
Unix.  I'm attaching a piece of the install screen where the problem is
displayed.  Any help or info would be greatly appreciated.

        cd ipopd;make
        cd imapd;make

Making Pico and Pilot
make CC=cc -f makefile.sv4

Making Pine.
make CC=cc -f makefile.sv4

Jimmy,

Sounds like you need to enlarge your /var filesystem.  Ask your system 
administrator to assist (unless you're it, of course).

   Dear Friends,

   For the past two weeks, I have been facing problem in composing
   message in e-mail. While editing and running the cursor over the
   letters, the letters are displaced and the same word is repeated
   two or three times. While typing, I don't have any problem, but
   problem is only when editing. Previously, I didn't have any problem.
   This is only after I tried to change the font. No font was mentioned
   at that time. From the font option, none of them was the previous
   one. My computer operator tried and couldn't do anything for this.
   If anyone could help me to get the previous font or getting the
   problem corrected, your help would be greatly appreciated. From my
   signature, you could understand my problem in correcting the composed
   mail. I tried to recorrect the word INDIA, but could not. Please
   suggest some idea to rectify the present pr. I have also trien to
   use the "Contl.L" to clear the repeated letters.

   For an example:

   If you are poor, work.f.If you are rich work.

   I tried to edit after the message was typed. Letters were misplaced.

   Thanks,

   D.S.

Hi Joe, Jimmy, 

I have the same problem in installing PINE 4.02. The /var file system has
about 120 MB free space during installation and yet I get this fatal error
about the assembler 'as' not being able to allocate 40000 bytes in
/var/tmp. I've noticed that when this error occurs, the freemem parameter
as reported by the command "sar -r 1 5" drops dangerously low to about 100
bytes. I wonder if this is the real reason for the fatal error.  Would
appreciate if any of you can throw light on this.

In any case I'm going to do the installation this weekend in Single user
mode so that other user processes do not hog memory. I'll get back on my
findings.

Bye

Dear Saravanan,
The problem here is that the screen is probably not refreshing itself
during editing. Its a very common problem on vt-100 terminal emulators. To
refresh the screen just type ^L (Ctrl-L) and things should be just fine.

Regards

Navin

   Dear Navin,

   Thanks a lot for your quick reply. I tried Cont.L to clear the 
   unwanted letters on the screen. It works well, but the letters
   are misplaced. Do you have anyother way to rectify it.

   Thanks,

   D.S.

Dear Friends,

I have a small problem.  I cannot save any messages--sent or
received--because the system says my disc space is full.  Yet I half
junked many messages and it is still too large.

Is there any way to see how much space there is on my disc?  I cannot seem
to find the function to find out.  And the message saying that it is full
just flashes across my screen so I do not know what to do.

Any ideas/solutions would be appreciated.

Yours,
Sanjay

 Hi Sanjay,

   You didn't say if local or remote 'disc space' is full.  I'll assume
REMOTE, as you're in pine and reading messages (such as this), but, local
is still not out of the question. REMOTE or your ISP may delegate X amount
of free space for your USERID! That's your homepage, previously saved
files, or scripts your putting on the REMOTE. ERASE ~old~ files on the
remote and see if that helps. Try "ls -al | more" if your ISP is a UNIX
type server (if you can get to the command line), or delete REMOTE files
via your FTP, browser, lynx, or whatever software you run. 
   Your messages _ARE NOT_ in your file area until when read them.. they
are on the REMOTE system in a /usr/mail/ area. If your 2,4,6,8,10+
meg USERID area is "FULL", they (more messages) will not be saved. 
    Actually that brings up another point for saving, bring all those good
files home to your back-up disks (before your clear up your remote area),
and if you need it - it will be saved! :) 
  And In case I'm missing this altogether, and the system is yours, try
"free" for total disk space available on the system.

Hope that helps you..

Dear Friends,

I have a small problem.  I cannot save any messages--sent or
received--because the system says my disc space is full.  Yet I half
junked many messages and it is still too large.

Is there any way to see how much space there is on my disc?  I cannot seem
to find the function to find out.  And the message saying that it is full
just flashes across my screen so I do not know what to do.

Any ideas/solutions would be appreciated.

Yours,

Your "inbox" is normally on a separate file system than your folders.  So,
it is easy to understand how you can receive mail but cannot save.  If you
have only deleted mails in your inbox then it will not help your "save" and
"sent-mail" area.

You are a user of VSNL's services.  I assume you have a shell account.  When
you are out of pine type the command "quota" and it will display information
about your disk limits and usage.

I'm guessing that you will need to delete some old mails in your folders.

BTW, you should ask VSNL to upgrade their systems to pine4.02.  You are
currently running on a very old pine3.93!!!

Regards,
Ed

Since upgrading from 3.9x to 4.02, some users find that their messages
are being moved from their normaal INBOX (/var/mail/$USER) to
$USER/mbox. It doesn't happen to all users. I didn't spot anything
obvious in the .pinerc files. Can anyone give me an idea why this
happens to some users and not others? Our preference is the old
behavior (using /var/mail/$USER).

That's a function of imapd.  If $USER/mbox exists, it moves the INBOX
into it.  You can disable it by changing "EXTRADRIVERS=mbox" to
"EXTRADRIVERS=" in imap/Makefile and recompiling.

Hi,

I am running PINE 3.96 on Sun Station. Everytime I try to pipe messages to
a mail processing program the PINE reports the following errors:

   stty: : No such device or address
   stty: : No such device or address
   stty: : No such device or address
   stty: : No such device or address

Does anybody have a clue as to how I may go about finding the source of
this problem. 

Regards
~ajaz

Try your .cshrc or equivalent.  If Pine starts up pipe commands using
your shell, you will not want to have any commands like 'stty' or 'tset'
in your .cshrc.  They don't belong there anyway.  :)

An easy test is

if ($?prompt)

since [t]csh won't define an initial prompt if you are attached to a 
tty.

Navin,

Now it sounds like you don't have enough memory available.  How much do
you have total?  What kind of hardware are you running?

I ran into the same problem on a DEC Alpha box running Digital UNIX until I
checked the README for the patch:

The patch file itself is in context-diff format, and should be
understood by the "patch" utility.  To update Pine 4.02 source,
simply copy the patch file into the same directory as the pine4.02
source tree and type:

        patch -p < pine4.02A.patch

Nope, that wasn't it (I know that at least one of these users was not
using IMAP). But I finally found the answer by grepping through my pine
source tree:

      Beginning with Pine 4.00 (but also with earlier versions of the
      University of Washington's imapd server), a new INBOX access method
      is available as part of the standard configuration. It is called
      the "mbox" driver and it works like this:

      If the file "mbox" exists in the user's home directory, and is in
      Unix mailbox format, then when INBOX is opened this file will be
      selected as INBOX instead of the mail spool file. Messages will be
      automatically transferred from the mail spool file into the mbox
      file. Beginning with Pine 4.01, a message is displayed whenever
      Pine copies messages from the system mail spool directory to the
      mbox file.

(this is part of the release notes for Pine 4.0)

I've since found out that you need to specify an argument with the -p
option.  In this case, a "1" will do nicely.

i.e.  patch -p 1 < patch....

Sure, but when I started hunting the info, I didn't know that was where
I would find the answer :)

Once I found it in helptext.c, I knew to use the built-in help, though.
(that's where I cut&pasted it from in my previous message)

Greetings -

Whilst it is true to an extent to say that the imapd can cause the move of
mail to $HOME/mbox it would be more accurate to say that it is really the
function of the library of mail folder format interface routines USED by
the imapd that is responsible for the move.

This distinction, whilst subtle, is important: unless things have changed
between 3.9x and 4.0x both pine and imapd are linked against this library
(known as the C-Client library).

This means that Pine, even when used to access mail folders directly from
disk rather than via the imapd, will cause mail to be ripped out of the
delivery area and transferred to $HOME/mbox IF AND ONLY IF $HOME/mbox
already exists and is a valid mailbox format (this includes being an empty
file).

So the advise is good: change the EXTRADRIVERS line and recompile.  However
if you aren't using IMAP to access your mail folder you should recompile
*Pine* instead of the imapd.  (Actually even if you use imapd I'd suggest
you did both anyway so that they are consistent.)

Cheers,

Mike B-)

With pine 4.02 you can go to the address book and use the "forward" to
select any number of entries (1-entire) from your address book and send them
to someone.

To send the whole address book you can go to the address book, "select (;)"
, "all", then "apply" the forward.

Ed

Mike is entirely correct that both Pine and IMAPD use the same c-client
libraries.  However, unlike imapd, it is not necessary to recompile Pine
to disable the mbox driver.  You can edit the pinerc file to add mbox to
the "disable-these-drivers" variable.

low, it may cause this type of message.  40000 bytes really isn't that
much when you're talking 256Mb of memory.

If someone could tell me if these bugs have been reported that
would be great.

1) new mail coming in when you are expunging (hangs).

2) adding address to addressbook (Arithmetic Exception)

3) To much email (okay, that's just a flaw with my job :).

thanks for a great product.  ldap is awesome.

thanks,

Hi Folks!
I use Pine to read news (I know, I've been told it's a dumb thing to do,
but still...)
When accessing a *big* newsgroup, is there any way to mass-delete large
numbers of posts upon loading that newsgroup? My ISP allocates gargantuan
amounts of disc space, which results in "There are 5,496 messages in
comp.unix.aix" (for example)
I know this is a *Good Thing* (tm), but at times it's tiresome when I
simply want to read a smaller number, like anything from the last two days
as an example.
One answer, I realize, is to access the newsgroup through Pine more
regularly, and simply delete messages once read. That's impractical, since
I don't have time to do that on a daily basis.
Any suggestions?
As always, TIA
-Colin

You don't say, but I assume you are using UNIX Pine rather than PC-Pine?
(PLEASE help us to help you by giving more complete information, such as
version and version number!)

If you were using PC-Pine there is a Magical Way of having it store your
password locally in a file.  (Whether you think this is safe in your
environment is up to you to decide!)

However this is not present in UNIX Pine.  Instead you should be set up
Pine to establish a "pre-authenticated" connection to your IMAP server.  In
general this is more flexible and perhaps more secure than storing your
password in a file.

For this to work your Systems Manager must have enabled pre-authenticated
connections, by symbolic linking /etc/rimapd to the real imapd executable.

You then need to set up "rsh access" to the computer running your IMAP
server (and no, I'm not going to go into that again ... either trawl the
Pine-Info archives or ask your local Computer Centre Help Desk for
assistance).

You should then find that Pine will auto-open your mail folders without
your having to type in any username or password information at all.

Cheers,

Mike Brudenell

Hmm, since you wish for a pound and not for a penny, it seems that the
frequency is not *that* high ;-)

In Linux/Pine 4.02:

I'm trying to change my From: address from my ISP to usa.net.

I've tried every combination but the right one of
allow-changing-from/customized-hdrs in pine.conf.fixed, ~/.pinerc, and
pine.conf.

Has anyone actually succeeded in doing this?

Subject: I've broken my mailboxes...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

This isn't a pine-specific problem, really, but noone seems to know on the
Linux lists, so here goes.  In a nutshell, my problem is that all of my
user-level mailboxes are seen as "locked" when I use pine.  Every other
editor has a similar problem.  In addition, when I su to another account,
pine (and others) will still try to access the original accounts mailbox.
It's very strange.
	Now, just how did I manage to screw up my system so badly?  Here's
what I did.  I was having disk space problems while compiling in my /home
directory, and instead of lookng at the obvious place for the problem
(/home is full), I saw a /temp flash by, and assumed that it was the root
/temp.  So, I wiped the directory, thinking that it held nothing
important, anyway.  
	Of course, the real problem was that /home was full, and my
purgation did nothing for the compile.  However, when I tried my mailbox,
it was locked.  I went to each of my accounts, and they were all locked.
Root was still okay, of course.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had any
idea how I could go about fixing this.  I am running SuSE 5.2 Linux with
the 2.0.33 kernel.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Subject: Broken "sent-mail" and "postpone" features
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've broken the sent mail and postpone features of pine.  Here are the
details:

We've made 3 modifications to the c-client lib on top of which we've built
pine 4.02 (without the new patch):

1) the c-client "home directory" is "<user's home>/mail", instead of
   "<user's home>"
2) the default mailbox is "<user's home>/mail/INBOX", not in
   /var/spool/mail (We are using tmail to deliver messages here.)
2) the default mailbox creation format is mbx

Due to modification #1, I've had to make one small change in the
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf, pasted in below:

  # Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}optnl-directory-path[]
  folder-collections= Desktop []

This is needed because, as I've set things up, the mail folders are
directly in the c-client "home dir", not in "<home dir>/mail", as pine
expects.

Now, when I try to send a message (from any account), the following rules
apply:

1) if ~user/mail/sent-mail doesn't exist, pine prompts me for its
   creation; when I say yes, sent-mail is created, and a copy of the
   message is saved there before being sent, as normal

2) if ~user/mail/sent-mail *does* exist, and is in valid mbx format, pine
   says that "sent-mail doesn't exist".  That's right, "doesn't".  Then:

   a) if I ask pine to create sent-mail, it gives a failure message which
      is too long to fit in the status window.  Of course, the reason for
      failure is that sent-mail already exists!

#2 here, of course, is incorrect behavior.

A similar situation involves postponing messages; if the postponed
messages folder doesn't exist, things work normally.  Otherwise, it tries
to create the already-existing folder, and fails -- with the result that I
can't postpone more than one message.

I am at a loss to understand this seemingly irrational behavior on the
part of pine/c-client.  Are my three modifications to pine, together, some
sort of technological sin, of which I am unaware?  Is there a bug in
pine/c-client?

Thanks for any assistance!

I've done something similar, at least as regards the INBOX location, but
by editing $HOME/.pinerc:

	inbox-path=~/.mail/inbox/$USER

The other folders are in ~/mail as usual.  I'm using 'deliver' as the
sendmail delivery agent.

I think this will break ipop3d and imapd, because I haven't been able
to work out a simple source configuration which would persuade them to
look in the user's home directory instead of /var/spool/mail.  I don't
know if $HOME would be iterpreted at runtime.  Therefore I've put
symlinks for each user in /var/spool/mail.

I haven't tried POP and IMAP yet, but Pine works normally for telnet and
console users.  I realise you have made other changes, and this possibly
won't help.

People want to do things like this (at least in my case) to keep the
user's mail in the user's disk quota.  I was a little surprised that imapd
and ipop3d are (apparently) not configurable as to source directory, and
the point is ignored in the documentation.

You can get ipop3d and imapd to work with your setup with a very small
modification to c-client.  The file to edit is call env_unix.c, and, in
the latest uw-imap distribution, it is located in src/osdep/unix.  You
just modify the function sysInbox(), which returns the path to the file
where the default inbox goes.  In my case, I've replaced the following
commented-out line with the non-comment line:

    /*sprintf (tmp,"%s/%s",MAILSPOOL,myusername ());*/
    sprintf (tmp,"%s/INBOX",myHomeDir);          

In my setup, myHomeDir refers to ~user/mail.  Since you haven't made this
change, the %s in your sprintf will refer to plain old ~user, and you can
choose the mailbox path as is appropriate.

Perhaps this could be easier, but at least it is workable.  Thanks to Mark
for putting the reference to this file in the docs.

I put an "i" (without the quotes) in the initial keystrokes to bring up
the list of messages in the INBOX.

Later I changed my mind on the desirability of this feature and deleted
the "i".

Now I can't get rid of the "Bad inital keystroke "" (missing comma?)"
message when pine starts up.

I've tried backspacing, Ctrl-K, throwing the keyboard through the screen,
... . Nothing seems to get rid of the message.

Any ideas?

<blush> I just went into .pinerc and removed the "" at the end of:
initial-keystroke="".

It's gone.

Another thing to do (I just tried it) is
to use the 'd' key in setup config to delete
the entry in the keystrokes,

this is probably what the pine authors intended.

  It would have been nice if the empty string was the same, but
  at least there is an appropriate method to do it.

Does anyone know where I can find a patch for 4.00 to 4.01, so I can
apply the 4.02 patch? I can't seem to find one anywhere on the FTP site,
and from the changelog on the web site, it's a pretty extensive patch.

I'd rather not have to download all 4 megs of Pine again...

Hi, I recently started using Pine at college, and I have an annoying
problem.  Every time I log in to check my mail, I get the screen that says
that it's my first time to use Pine, and it wants to send me an email
about Pine.  How can I get it to stop doing this?  Thanks.

You have bad permissions on your home directory or your .pinerc. You must be
able to write to the directory, so its permissions should be 755; .pinerc
should be 644. Check these permissions and correct them.

Generate a fresh .pinerc with the command "pine -pinerc" and see what happens.

Hi,

A user on my Digital Alpha workstation is having difficulty deleting
mail from his pine INBOX. He has a number of messages marked with 'D'
but when he quits pine, he gets an error which says:

	write failed:  file system full

and the messages are not deleted. I have checked the /usr directory and
there are currently over 50 megabytes free. His INBOX file is 15 
megabytes in size (he doesn't use folders :-). We do not have quotas 
installed on our system, and no other users are having this problem.

Thanks in advance for your ideas!
