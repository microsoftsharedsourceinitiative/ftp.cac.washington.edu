I think Netscape does base64 encoding which means that it still sends it
as cleartext across the network.

Hello,
 I found, that pine creates these lock files in /tmp. Why world RW? ;-)

-rw-rw-rw-   1 mmokrejs system         4 Nov  2 00:02 .fffffffff0e5cb9d.6c21

In those files are PID's of pine. They are NOT created when user runs
pico editor. 

Is there any patch to this?

TIA
Martin Mokrejs

Hello,
 first of all, please CC your response to this thread if any. I'm not
subscribed to this list any more. ;)

I found, that pine creates these lock files in /tmp. Why world RW? ;-(

-rw-rw-rw-   1 mmokrejs system         4 Nov  2 00:02 .fffffffff0e5cb9d.6c21

In those files are PID's of pine. They are NOT created when user runs
pico editor. lsof utility also shows they are opened by pine.

Is there any patch to this? Tested on Digital Unix 4.0D, jumbo patch #2.

My coworker has been complaining that pine sometime "goes to sleep" when
he's trying to read mail. Has anyone else experienced this? His inboxes
sit on an imap server with the mbx folder format. This is pine 4.05...
Any ideas on this one? I have no idea why this would be happening

Does anyone have an eta on when the next version of pine is due?

Sorry about the obtuse subject line.  I did have a subject line of 
"Open failed messages - Pine 4.05", but the listproc at uwash rejected it -
said it was "suspicious" - whatever that means.  Any ideas about that?

Anyway, that's not what I want to talk about.

I'm running Pine 4.05 on a Linux 2.0.35 machine, and I can't get it to go
properly anymore.  By "anymore", I mean that it previously worked, then at a
fairly unknown time in the recent past, it failed to work properly and hasn't
since.

There are two system changes which may, possibly, have caused the change.  I
have deleted some symlinks which I believed were redundant - mainly to do with
/var/adm, /usr/adm, some /var/spool/ files (not mail, or anything like that),
some XWindows links (I do not use pine in X), and a few dangling pointers.

The other system change which I can determine may, possibly have caused the
trouble was the addition of another host to the network.  This is a
part-time Linux box, used as a workstation by several members of our group. 
I don't see how this could have caused the problem, but I include it for
completeness.

I first noticed the problem when, in a listing of all files in my home dir
(ls -a ~) I saw several .pine-debug? files.  I understood that these files
referred to error conditions, and so I checked them out.

Imagine my surprise when I found the following in them:

---[START .pine-debug1]---
Debug output of the Pine program (debug=2 debug_imap=0). Version 4.05
Sun Oct 25 15:54:19 1998

reading_pinerc "/usr/lib/pine.conf"
Open failed: No such file or directory
reading_pinerc "/home/mpalmer/.pinerc"
Read 12449 characters:
read_pinerc: pinerc_written = 909289906
reading_pinerc "/usr/lib/pine.conf.fixed"
Open failed: No such file or directory
[remainder removed for brevity]
---[END .pine-debug1]---

It was this Open failed business which rattled me.  I checked to ensure that
the files which were unopened did still in fact exist - as they do.  I
tested opening them with a test program (along the lines of main() {int fd;
fd = open("/usr/lib/pine/pine.conf", O_RDONLY); if (fd < 0) perror("testprog"); else printf("all's
well"); close(fd)}) but that program indicated that there was no problem
opening the file.

Along with this, several options which previously worked no longer operate
correctly.  I am referring specifically to the habit of using the TAB key to
go to the next folder with unread messages.  I cannot remember which option
to use, but I cannot find the correct option, and I cannot make this option
work.

Can anyone suggest a solution to the problem?  I have checked the Pine Info
Center at UWash, but it has no suggestions.

Solaris 2.6 pine 4.05 w/ ldap.

when I use imap or /var/mail/inbox there is a race condition when I'm
clearing out the inbox and there is new mail delivered, the
.pine-debug keeps repeating "There is 1 new message".  and pine
hangs.

Do I have any options?  Has anyone else seen this?

Thanks,

Hi all
I am having problem printing from pine when I telnet to a host using a
terminal emulation software.
If I use attached-to-ansi option of the printer set up the process of
printing completes without
a hitch but nothing comes out of the printer.

Thanks for the help

Ameet

I find that the only telnet software that consistently works with the Y
command is SmartTerm.  I can't get any other telnet connection (including
the dos shell in W-95) to work with Y.

We use NetTerm with Win3.x/Win95/Win98 and don't experience any problems.
They can be found at http://Starbase.NeoSoft.COM/~zkrr01/.  We also use
PC-Pine 4.05, which works pretty well too.

Passthrough print does indeed vary a great deal between telnet clients. The
telnet.exe that comes with Windows does not do it at all. Anzio, available as
below, handles it fine.

 I'm not sure if this is directly Pine related, or a problem on my end,
however perhaps you can help.
I'm trying to compile Pine 4.05 on a linux platform using "build lnx"
Here is an excerpt from the tail:
____
/usr/i486-linux/bin/ld: cannot open -ltermcap: No such file or directory
make: *** [pine] Error 1

Links to executables are in bin directory:

Done

For some reason it only compiled mtest and imapd, not pine/pico, which
are the two I really want upgraded :)

When I get an attachment in email and I am trying to save it in another
directory, I can use the brower view to navigate to a different dir but it
won't give me the option of saving in that directory directly with the
file name as an option. What I would like would be a "Save Here" option
after I have navigated to that dir via the browser.

Apparently, you don't have /usr/lib/libtermcap.a  Do you have libterminfo?

Also, a problem I've encountered under linux while building pine involves
the crypt() function, which is not actually referenced anywhere in the
make or header files. There are 4 makefiles that need to have -lcrypt
added to them, and the os_lnx.h file needs to have an include added. This
is under redhat anyway, I would expect it is probably a glibc-related
issue, but easily fixable. If anyone else has had this problem, let me
know, I'll send you a patch I made.

Note to the pine developers, if you're listening, it would be nice to have
this fixed!

Yes.  Glibc has the crypto library separated from its normal distribution due
to export issues.  So if crypto functions are being used, they should be
referenced for glibc versions.  Perhaps the build script should check to see
if the -lcrypt is necessary.

I suspected as much. Might want to change the build script and appropriate
header/make files to build libc or glibc (of course, this now makes for 4
different linux options - maybe just detecting libc/glibc would be better)

I don't know the reason but I believe that with recent Linux versions one
have to try
    build sl5
or
    build sl4

Might the binaries for HP-UX 10.2 on the FTP site for
PINE already contain the LDAP support?  

If not, I will have to complie a build with LDAP support
correct?  I am new to that process.  Where can I find 
documentation on how to do it?  I have looked at the FAQ
and archieves on the PINE site.  I need more background
than I found there.

Why doesn't PC-Pine have all of the regular commands that unix pine has?
I really miss Bounce, Select, Headers, etc.

PC-Pine *does* have these commands. Did you check your feature-list? Try
going to Setup/Config and checking what's been enabled.

Hi,

I've actually wanted this feature for quite some time but there must be a
reason why it's not there.  I think the rr idea is great but it shouldn't
need to use an external server.  It should just be a header.

Pine-info people would you mind taking a look at this and letting me know
what you think of implementing this.  It'd deffinately be an idea but
would most certainly have to be a standard that other email programs
follow.  Is there an RFC on the topic?

Okay, saw this:
 Use -lncurses, if libncurses doesn't work for you use the option
     -L/usr/lib/termcap -ltermcap and if libcurses is required too
     -L/usr/lib/curses -lcurses may help.
    The termcap-package needs to be installed.

However I'm not familiar with any of this. I have since tried
"build -ln curses lnx"
"build -L/usr/lib/termcap -ltermcap lnx"
"build L/usr/lib/curses -lcurses lnx" 
without the quotes of course, and no luck. I do have a SuSE box, and am
stuck with Pine3.96 I guess...

Do you think it would be possible, when in the index of folders, <eg:
INBOX               Mailinglist1        MailingList2
fromwork            fromwife


etc, it could maybe be followed by a 5/2  or something, meaning 5 emails
in that folder, and 2 of them are new.

Shane,

You might want to read FAQ #3.2: Can I get a "return-receipt" when sending
a message with Pine?

The Pine FAQ is available at:

You have to change the -ltermcap in -lncurses
in the pine and pico 
directory
than is should work fine

 Once I manually edited Makefile.lnx in both /pico and /pine
it compiled flawlessly, thannks to those that helped.
I noticed that some URLS can be "clicked" and some can't.
As well, the biggest complaint I could have for Pine is to to notify the
user of how many emails in each folder, and how many NEW.
eg:

INBOX 5/3  Pine-List 43/40   From-Work 10/5


etc. Currently mu users and I find ourselves checking all our folders
manually. This can get tedious if you have alot of folders. I must send
out a thank-you to the best email client I've used to date. (Not to
mention I don't know a Linux user that hasn't used Pico).

Trying to install Pine4.02 on a Unisys U6000 running System V Release 4
Version 2 ( Unisys Version 1.3) Operating System and having trouble
compiling.  I have pasted the output from the build of Pine below.  Any
information on what to do to fix it or where to go from here would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

I know sent messages go to the sent-mail folder, I don't understand why
messages won't go into the Inbox.  I hope this helps to explain my question
below.

Thanks

Subject: problems with automounted spool file

I am using pine 4.05 on Linux 2.0.35 and my spool file is in an
NFS-automounted directory. I _sometimes_ get the following screen:

->N   1 Nov 13 flo@plato.physik.uni-kons   (679K) /var/mnt/mail/flo

    [Folder "INBOX" opened with 1 message READONLY]

Instead of showing the mails in the spool file it shows me the whole
spool file as a single mail.

This is related to the automounted directory because I hadn't had this
problem before, when I used to work on a locally mounted spool file.

Any ideas?

When I compose a message to a user with Pine the message never hits the
users
Inbox(he does not get the message).  I can however use "mailx" and it
will go in
the Inbox and I am able to read it with Pine.  I am running on the
System V Release 4 port of Pine.  We don't have the "/var/spool/mail"
directory over in SVR4, we have "/var/mail".  I have a Linux System with
Pine and it works fine, the users get their messages.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated

TIA,

Jimmy Miller

Hello, all.

Have a curious situation:

I set up a perl program to feed a signature-like thing to a FIFO
named "~/.signature".  Works fine (`cat .signature` prints what I
want).  If I load up pine with the signature-file value as <Empty
Value> (not default), and then I ^R to read in .signature, it also
reads it in just fine.

But, if I set up pine with signature-file to be .signature, then
when I do a compose, it breaks the pipe.  I can only assume that the
way in which pine reads the signature file differs between a ^R read
and an automatic 'include signature on compose' read.

Anyone shed any light on this?

Thanks!
-jeff with a manually inserted .sig (not speaking for Learjet, I just
work there).

I've just setup my incomming directories/folders filter, and would like to
setup the read-messages filter, but it doesn't show you the proper syntax.
I'd like to setup it up as follows: 

new pine mail goes to ~/mail/INCOMMING/pine-new
and once read, I'd like it to go to ~/mail/pine-list
the same for ~/mail/INCOMMING/work-new
to go to ~/mail/work  once it has been read.
 How do I set this filter up?

you was delivered to our domain, perhaps via
a mailing list, with the following header:


Date: Wed, 11 Nov 1998 18:26:26 -0600 (EST)
From: Brad Wyman <tildar@mwt.net>
X-Sender: tildar@tildar.tildar.net
To: igorr@sdf.lonestar.org
cc: manhattan-list@redhat.com, recipient list not shown: ;


the "-0600 (EST)" is an illegal timezone declaration;
EST is 5 zones east of GMT, not 6.

i'm telling you this because that bogus time stamp
is a symptom of a forged header used by one of the
mailers favored by spammers and most spam filters
mark messages with that fingerprint as having a high
likelihood of being spam.

i'm just tipping you off that it's in your best
interest to set your system's timezone specification
correctly, or you stand a good probability of having
your messages rejected or filtered.

Pine does a stat on the file to see how big it is and then reads that many
bytes, so that doesn't work right with named pipes. The next version of
pine will allow you to indicate that the sig file is a program instead of
a file to be read by appending a | character to that name.

Hello all,

While I was testing the archive feature of SmartList I found some
strange operation of PC-Pine 4.05 on a WNT 4.0 SP3 Workstation. (Sorry,
if the problem below is a well-known one...)

Because we use national (8bit) characters in the body (and sometimes the
header) of messages, the archive server encode these messages before
sending either using the base64 or the quoted-printable algorithm. The
content type is set to "message/rfc822".

If I try to open such an archive message in Pine:

- the message contains only an attachment.
- after opening the attachment, I cannot see the message body: I get a
  "Can't display missing text segment" message instead.
- I haven't got an export command - all I can do is to save the
  attachment into a message folder. If the message was encoded with
  base64, the saved message is unusable (there are no headers).

Comments:

- If I retrieve plain ASCII messages (there is no encoding necessary),
  PC-Pine works as expected.
- If I modify the SmartList algorithm to send messages with 8bit
  encoding, PC-Pine still works as expected.
- Pine 3.95 (on a RedHat 4.2) also fails to display the message, but it
  can export it. The exported file is correctly decoded.
- Netscape Messenger also has troubles with encoded messages...
- MS Outlook Express handles encoded letters correctly: the encoded
  letter appears as an attachment; it opens in a new message window
  with correct decoding.

Thanks for your patience,

Tibor

P.S. More details about the problem:

I issue a get command for an older message. In the reply message I can
see the following header items:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="volume1998/11"
Content-Type: message/rfc822;
        directory="volume1998"; name="11"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Message body is not shown, instead I see:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    [ Part 1, Message/RFC822  1.1KB. ]
    [ Not Shown. Use the "V" command to view or save this part. ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I press V and get the attachment index:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
   1   ~1.1 KB      Message/RFC822, "list Digest V98 #11"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If I press ENTER I get the following screen:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a student at Middle Tenneese State University(MTSU) and I have
an e-mail frank account in here:dc2b@frank.mtsu.edu.
I was trying to send an e-mail to France but the Mail Delivery Subs
returned my mail saying that it had fatal errors.
I don't really know how pine works so can you please tell me if am I
able to send an e-mail everywhere using pine?
Do I have to do anything special or different?
Thank you for your time.
You can send me an answer at the address above.

Hello !!!

I don't know if this exists in new realeses of Pine, but I do know that
this works in 3.96 versions. 
I found this bug on the web.
----------
 Hello Everyone. I would like to announce that I have discovered what
appears
to be a rather serious bug in the Pine Mail Client, that allows a user of
Pine to overwrite ANY file, with ANY permissions or ownerships in their
home
directory (including sub-directorys).

 This bug can be used to overwrite a protected login script, or to
overwrite
a resource file (like .pinerc). This can be of serious concern to those
that
use Pine as a shell for users, as this can allow them to modify or create
files that could be used to gain shell access. (Such as .rhosts, .forward,
etc.)

 All that is required to exploit this apparent bug is to open up a message
attachment using the Pine attachment viewer, and save the attachment.
 If you want to overwrite ANY file anywhere in the users home directory,
just enter the file name and select overwrite. This does not work outside
of the users home directory BTW.

 The interesting thing about this is that it appears to completly bypass
any
filesystem level security (permissions, owner, etc.). Also, when pine
overwrites the file it sets the mode to 622 (-rw-r--r--) and the owner to
the current user. (The pine executable IS NOT setuid root.)

 I have verified this behavior on Pine version 3.95 & 3.96 on Linux
systems.
So far I have not been able to find a version or system that is not
susceptable.

 I do not currently know of any patch or fix for this behavior.
----------------------

Hello !!!

Maybe the Pine Developers could make a new feature with which you can post
all your messages that are in postponed folder at once. So, you don't have
to press for every message CTRL-X. 
What do you think?

Because you own your home directory.
Try saving a file to a subdirectory that isn't owned by you.

It sets the mode to your current umask, at least according to my
experiments.  Also see above.

Because it's the default behavior on unix systems.

You might look into a shorter .sig as well :)

OK, but keep in mind that you asked.

A. That you need to RTFM about sig files.
B. That you need to RTFM about sigdashes.
C. That you are a sniveling idiot who complains too much.
D. That you don't know what the mail list is for.
E. That you don't know how to properly compose email.

Shall I continue???

(Yes, I'm back, so if you're an idiot, think twice before you post)

(And no, I didn't trim the orig post.  Look at this stupid sig!!)

   Not a bug in pine. That's just the way the Unix file system works, for
better or for worse. Don't believe me? Try this...

su
touch ~user/deleteme
chmod 000 ~user/deleteme
now go back to being "user"

ls -l deleteme
  ----------  1 root  wheel  0 Nov 16 16:16 deleteme

rm deleteme
  override ---------  root/wheel for deleteme? 
  (answer y and the file is gone)

   Ak! The shell is broken- fix it! :) I know this doesn't explain
everything- but this list is about pine, not Unix in general. You should
probably read up on the way Unix handles file hierarchy, and man chmod.
There's probably a way to accomplish what you want, but "fixing" this in
pine won't do any good. When you "man chmod" pay close attention to the
part on sticky bits and see if it's any help.

-=Jim=-

P.S. Once you understand all of this, the issue of overwriting files will
     be immediately revealed. (hint: you're probably using a copy of the
     file you're editing)

Subject: POP3 vs IMAP with PINE

I am looking for some clarification....

The PINE documentation for 4.05 says PINE uses
IMAP to access messages.  Does that mean it
will not work with a POP3 server?  Or is POP3 
a subset for IMAP?  Or is there an option
in PINE to tell it to use POP3?

Thanks...

Subject: IMAP folders
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I've been admining the Pine IMAP interface at MSU here for years.   On
3.96 we used:

folder-collections = {mail.mankato.msus.edu}inbox.[]

This allowed us to create and delete folders....

With the same folder-collection line 4.05 doesn't show the folders
anymore.  4.05 does allow me to create a folder but it won't show it to
me... If I exit 4.05 and then look from 3.96 viola the folders I
created on 4.05 are usable.

Why can't I see these folders on 4.05?  If I use:
folder-collections = {mail.mankato.msus.edu}[INBOX.%]
The folders show under 4.05 but then this configuration doesn't work
with 3.96, and it acts really goofy under 4.05.

There must be a configuration that works with both 3.96 and 4.05.  I
looked at the source on 4.05 a bit and it looks like the context code
has been changed quite a bit since 3.96.  I suspect things aren't
working quite right.  It looks like the context is:
{mail.mankato.msus.edu}%s

I'm no expert in this code (far from it) but it appears that the
context should NEVER have a "%s" in it.

Subject: Auto move emails

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

How can I make emails with a certain subject, for example: form*
so I can have all email with the subject: form*  automatically put into a
certain folder. I know procmail does this, but it doesn't seem to work
that great. Does anyone know how to do this? I am pretty sure Pine can do
this..

Thanks,

According to the many documents and faqs about pine, pine does not do
filtering. Procmail works fantastically when properly set up.

Yep, procmail doesn't work.
That's why everybody uses it.

Shouldn't your question have been something along the lines of:

"I don't know how to use procmail (or regex's), can somebody help me
off-line, and educate me???  I've read some web pages on this topic, but
still have some questions."

If so, I'd be more than willing to help you.

I use Filter to filter out my mail and I use pine so they are right Pine
will not do it by its self but you can use procmail or filter to do it.

Here is a webpage that might help..

I use procmail myself.. 
i did use elm's filering for a while, but i found that to be inadequate
for most things (could only do simple from's, to's and subjects) whereas
procmail can filter based on info in the email header and body as well..

Thnx.

not all URLs are "clickable", why is this? do they need "a href"??

Hi all,

Is there any way in PINe 3.96 that you save all the deleted messages in a
folder that you can delete later on.

I dont want to move messages to a junk folder for time being thinking as i
have deleted them.

TIA,
Nayan...!

I've just installed pine 4.05 for HPUX 10.20 using the pre-compiled
binaries. Can anyone explain the following behaviour? I cannot find
any configuration options which seem to relate.

When one user starts pine, their new mail stays in the inbox.

When another user starts pine, the new mail gets moved from the
inbox to ~/mbox. There is a message in the debug file "IMAP 15:06:01
11/19 mm_log warn: Moved 6834 bytes of new mail to /home/michael/mbox
from /var/mail/michael"

Both users had the first behaviour under Pine 3.96, and we are not
(yet) running an imap server.

I prefer that the users have their mail automatically moved to their
home directories, but I can't figure out why it does (or does not) do
it.

That shouldn't be by default enabled. Pine claims to support IMAP indexing
messages. It's fine that it doesn't show IMAP index messages to the user
(can be seen by Mail or mail). But I hope it's shouldn't create the
message itself. It's fine when this message is created when user uses
IMAP, otherwise there's no reason to create this index message.

It's quell-folder-internal-msg option - another which should be enabled by
default (see below). 

> 11/19 mm_log warn: Moved 6834 bytes of new mail to /home/michael/mbox >

The mbox-driver moves first mails from /var/spool/mail/username to
$HOME/mbox, while quitting pine mails are moved to $HOME/mail/read-messages 
by default.

Try to change your settings in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf
	read-message-folder=mbox
This will moved read--but-undeleted-messages to $HOME/mail/mbox

Change the 'mail-directory' variable to $HOME if you want to move
messages to ~username/mbox. I hope this should be the default pine
behavior (for backwards compatibility with mail or Mail)! Also, I hope by
default should be disabled the mbox-driver, which generates unnecessary
I/O. To disable mbox-driver, place in pine.conf this line:

disable-these-drivers=mbox

>From technical notes:

#
#          The mbox driver enables the following behavior: if there is a file called mbox in your
#          home directory, and if that file is either empty or in Unix mailbox format, then every
#          time you open INBOX the mbox driver will automatically transfer mail from the system mail
#          spool directory into the mbox file and delete it from the spool directory. If you disable
#          the mbox driver, this will not happen.
#          It is not recommended to disable the driver which supports the system default mailbox
#          format. On most non-SCO systems, that driver is the unix driver. On most SCO systems, it
#          is the mmdf driver. The system default driver may be configured to something else on your
#          system; check with your system manager for additional information.
#          It is most likely not very useful for you to disable any of the drivers other than
#          possibly mbox. You could disable some of the others if you know for certain that you don't
#          need them but the performance gain in doing so is very modest.
#


Also the feature-list options were difficult for me to set up - it's well 
hidden in the documentation. I thought I should list them one line by line
.... No. This is the proper way:

feature-list=delete-skips-deleted, uto-open-next-unread, quell-folder-internal-msg

Sorry for wasting the bandwidth.

I'm confused what you are looking for then.

You want to save all the deleted messages to a folder that you can delete  
later, but you don't want to move them to a folder, thinking that you've  
deleted them.

Why not just delete them but don't expunge them?

For better or worse, Pine 4.xx has the "mbox" driver enabled by default,
The mbox driver looks for a file in one's home directory named "mbox" and
if it finds one (and it is in a valid mailbox format), automatically moves
mail from the spool directory.

This is discussed in the Release Notes and the Pine tech notes.

Dear Friends,

I am facing a severe problem. We offer pine, lynx and ftp services to 
our users. We do not offer a shell prompts to users rather we offer 
these services through a 'text menu' interface. But for the past few 
days, I am observing a user who runs pine and within five minutes he 
runs commands like chmod ps which we do not offer in our text based menu 
for users. I think he suspends pine some how and gets a shell prompt. I 
have disabled pine suspension in pine.conf.fixed in /usr/local/lib.
The pine.conf.fixed contains:

feature-list=no-enable-unix-pipe-cmd,no-enable-alternate-editor-cmd,no-enable-suspend,no-enable-alternate-editor-implicitly,auto-move-read-msgs
The ownerships of files are given below:

-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     other    1044480 Nov  4 12:34 pico
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     other    4285400 Nov  4 09:59 pine  

while the said user is busy in breaking the system, the output of the ps 
-aef|grep 'user' command shows the following:


jack 14183 14182  0 16:32:29 pts/0    0:00 pine
jack 14299 14183  0 16:32:58 pts/0    0:00 sh -c /home/jack/get-pswd
jack 14300 14299  0 16:32:59 pts/0    0:00 /home/jack/get-pswd

I blocked the account being mis-used but similar attempts are being done 
by many other users.

I am really worried and want to know how can I stop execution of 
commands from pine. Please help me on making pine secure. I was using 
pine 3.93 and have recently upgraded to pine 4.05 but the situation is 
same.Do I need to modify pine.conf.fixed? Do I need to change the 
ownership of pine from root to bin etc or not.( I know the hacker gets 
root previledges after he breaks pine).


Please help me....

Thanks in advance. I will summarize.

Can he stop you text-based menu? Is it a shell script? Did you use
'trap' commands to disable Ctrl+c and other interrupts?

The default editor is pico? If is it vi, he can start shell from
within that.

As I see he can start shell immediately from pine. Disable the pipe
command from within pine.conf.fixed

Demo:

shell$ echo a |more

type !sh and have a shell

I did not repeat it right now in pine 4.05, but I believe it will work.

If they get root privs, you can't be sure with just anything, then you
don't need to selve such problems. backup data, reinstall system. That's
the only solution.

set speller to bash, compose a message with the word bash (or any other
set of commands) at the top of the file and then invoke the speller....
works like a charm.

Add speller to your fixed file.

Also as someone else has already pointed out... if they have already
gotten root stop, reinstall, and start again.

   Here are the "Holes" I have commonly found exploitable on systems with
"pine-only" access. They are all pretty easy to fix with conf.fixed,
although some of them will be tricky if you want to give the functionality
intended without exposing yourself...

   alternate editor
   speller
   custom-print command 
   message piping

   All of these (and maybe a couple I have missed) can be used to execute
commands or gain a shell. You also might want to examine your policy on,
since they can aid in (if not allow outright) unauthorized accesses.

   custom headers (especially "From")
   directory access
   changing password from within pine
   allowing any alterations to the .pinerc file at all
   reading in and saving out files

   If you haven't been rooted already by one of these users, you are
extemely lucky. You should definitely consider a re-install, or at least a
thorough comparison with known good copies of all the key system binaries,
and a full scan for anomalous files and directories. (esp. setuid root
executables)

   You should also check your logs (if they haven't been altered or
erased) and find out where these users were coming from. Contacting their
local administrator would be a good idea to help prevent future problems.

Subject: "Message to save shrank!" (Netscape interaction)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

One of our users was surprised to see this warning when
he tried to save a message to another folder:

    [Message to save shrank!  (#1: 1473 --> 1472)]

It turns out that he's also been using Netscape on a PC
to read his mail, for various reasons that seem good to him.
Netscape is adding headers like this to the messages it reads:

    X-Mozilla-Status: 8001

What isn't obvious (at least from Pine) is that Netscape is
adding a carriage return to the end of the header, DOS style.
That's the missing character that causes the message to shrink.

I guess it's not surprising that moving mail folders back
and forth between Windows and Unix would cause confusion.
On the other hand, Pine 3.95 doesn't seem to be bothered.
Should Pine 4.0x be able to ignore carraige returns too?

I have just upgraded to pine 4.05. I am begining to wish I had not....
When I start Pine I get a message saying 
mailbox vunerable directory protection must be 1777. 

a mode of 1777 gives the world read/write/execute access. This make no
sense. 

I have a 2nd and 3rd account the 2nd one give me the same error, the third
does not... (figure that one out...) these two accounts are identical. I
have already check the protection and they are exactly the same....

look around the official pine site at the university of washington, and
learn for yourself.  it has to do with the access permissions of the
inbox.  of course you know this.  i guess 1777 has a 1 in it, or
sticky-bit thus people can create random files in your inbox, but that's
it.  or something.  i don't know.  all i know is you have found the answer
to your question, and there is nothign else anyone can do.  perhaps you
should seek resources that are more knowledgeable in the ways of the unix.

Hello Every one...

Does anyone have any pointers on how can I extract the "From" field and 
the "Subject" field of a message that is marked for deletion and just
before it is Expunged.

I need to be able to to store those two pieces  of information in a file.

I have to source code for pine but, I am not  sure where to look in it for
the function that does all the expunging ......


Sincerely 
Paaras Kumar

I wonder if Tobey wrecked-her like he wrecked his reputation <G>


Anyways, is it possible to post to Newsgroups, using a different username,
then the normal one? ie can I change it to NG_BOY@ instead of YASHY@
when posting to newsgroups, and then just create an account for all the
replies to go too? I don't want to have to use a seperate account to read
newsgroups and/or post to them. As well I don't wnat to have to manually
change the From: header everytime. 
Thanks in advance.

p.s. Is there a Pine Icon, for fans to add to their webpage(s)?

It is.  Some people just hyper-ventilate when confronted with messages which
violate their notion of netiquette.

As for random tag lines....different solutions have been posted in the past.
You should probably check the archives to see if any fit your situation.

That's true.
However, this mail list is for asking TECHNICAL questions about pine.
Not stupid shit like random sig files.

Your point???
Those of us who have been around for, eh, forever, have very strong
feelings on these things.  Exist a little, experience things, write
a RFC, or even a white paper, before you pass judgement on "some people"

The best thing is, you two fuckstains TOTALLY missed the answer.
Robin's post contained a URL that pointed DIRECTLY to the web page that
had the answer to his question.

However, *PLONK*, I don't care.

Including in Robin's .sig in his reply

	http://www.kens.com/robin/pine-tips.html#pine-randsig
	

I would also agree that Tobey's original .sig was far too long, and was  
improperly marked (the '-- ' was about 7 lines to late).

In addition, the ____ stuff in the Subject: line was entirely unnecessary,  
and he misspelled the first word in his Subject: line (and "Composs")

Add that to asking a very FAQ, and it really doesn't lead one to want to  
supply the answer.

I'd say Robin was generous to supply one at all.

TjL,
	still wondering when this list will turn to a more technical side of 
	PINE rather than the same stuff that is asked on the newsgroup.

but it was effectively not there because his mail was totally
discredited by what preceded it.  You don't read that kind of stuff
to the end.

But, guys, wasn't it a hoot to see one of the baby policemen, who
has made nil acknowledged contribution to Pine, unleash his foul
mouth at Ed Greshko?  Heh.  Maybe when he is a bigger boy he will
look at the source.

Well, I happened to see it... it didn't take much looking, especially when  
it said 'pine-randsig' at the end.

*sigh* maybe I just think like Robin ;-)

You are not alone in that. :-)
But as the origin to this thread was a faq.. And it got the answer.. Why
don't we drop this silly thread in the /dev/null where it belongs?

Be excellent to each other.

No, it isn't. You are. You and your mailer. Hence the subject (we'll
come to that right after the next flame...)

> I wasn't allowed to send to the list .. so now I'll get two copies of

You're even more stupid than your first remark would lead one to
believe. Listen and repeat: m-a-n p-r-o-c-m-a-i-l. What was your
username again?

Anyway: If I may say this although I'm certainly never going to
implement it... I love mutt's and Gnus' hooks. Really, I do. Like
this:

# I'm someone else on the pine mailing list:
folder-hook PINE my_hdr From: rsocha(at)kens.com # Windows has eaten
						 # my alt+gr

In a time where everyone uses half a dozen accounts, this is a pretty
nifty feature, I'd say. Check sven guckes' website for a pretty cool
custom setup (and great vim stuff, too).

>"Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for you are crunchy and

Geez, but you do read *old* books, don't you? But then again, you use
an obsolete OS, so there... Hehehe...

*lol* What I ment was that I get two copies sent to me. That is spam.
(Eventhough I wont get no more than one email with the same MESSAGE-ID...
 Almost anyway. It should really be filtered at the source and not at the 
destination.)

Naa .. I'll use procmail to do that. Just that I haven't got around to fix
that sendfilter yet. ;-)
Perhaps I just kill myself instead..
(I think the social service will love that.)

Damn you Robin. ;-)
That was my random sig .. and I have selected those with care.
I use pine as a mailer.. It's great for my kind of work..
Not that I have any employment.. but it's still great.

Subject: Pine 4.05 and Simeon IMAP server
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/plain; CHARSET=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 beta -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN

I have reported this problem a couple times before but there seems to
be a new twist.  

Before I reported that folders on a remote IMAP server that were
created with Pine 4.05, Pine 3.96, TkRat etc. don't appear using Pine
4.05.  Well this only seems to be true when the server is a Simeon IMAP
server.

If any developer would like to try pointing to our Simeon IMAP server
please contact me and I'll set up an account.

I've looked at the IMAP code generated between 3.96 and 4.05 and there
are differences that seem to make the 4.05 not see the folders on
Simeon IMAP.

3.96:
IMAP DEBUG 12:00:46 11/30: A00003 FIND ALL.MAILBOXES inbox.*
IMAP DEBUG 12:00:46 11/30: * MAILBOX inbox.blue
IMAP DEBUG 12:00:46 11/30: A00003 OK Completed

4.05:
IMAP DEBUG 12:04:04 11/30: 00000005 LIST inbox. %
IMAP DEBUG 12:04:05 11/30: * LIST () "." INBOX
IMAP DEBUG 12:04:05 11/30: * LIST (\Noselect) "." news

Could someone explain why 4.05 uses ``LIST inbox. %'' as opposed to the
working ``FIND ALL.MAILBOXES inbox.*'' that was generated in 3.96.

Jeff,

I believe the reason for this has to do with the different IMAP versions.
IMAPv2 (which is what was implemented for PINE 3.xx) uses the 'FIND
ALL.MAILBOXES' command syntax.  PINE 4.xx implemented IMAPv4rel1 syntax.
Although it is not explicitly excluded from the RFC for IMAPv4rel1, the
'FIND' commands are considered optional.  Therefore, in order to maintain
compliancy with the majority of servers, the PINE source was updated to use
the most current set of commands.  You may want to look at the RFC's for
more details (not sure which ones off the top of my head).

I would suspect that there is an update for the Simeon server to make it
IMAPv4rel1 compliant.  Otherwise, you may be able to munge the source code
to re-establish the old format commands.  (We actually had to do the
opposite here with PINE 3.96.  Had to modify source to implement IMAP4
commands for a server that didn't recognize the old format)

Good luck,

Jody

We at Minnesota State Unversity, Mankato, use pine3.96 to access our
Simeon IMAP server.  We have a campus address book that has been made
read-only.  This file gets indexed into a lu file once each rebuild.

In the summer (or as it turns out during low usage days) everything
works JUST FINE.  ...but most of the time when composing a message
(during alias expansion) the system THINKS that the lu file on our
read-only address books is out of date and causes a /tmp/a3nnnnnn lu
file to be created for each read-only address book for EACH user
trying to compose a message (OUCH).  Pine also complains that the
mtime is ~1-12 seconds too new.

It appears that pine encodes the creation time for the lu file
internally.  This time is then compared against the mtime of the text
address book.  If the text file is newer than the lu then the lu is
rebuilt.  By placing a fuzz factor of a few seconds between the time
encoded in the lu file and the mtime, the overzealous remaking of lu
files has stopped.  Does anyone see anything completely insane in
doing this?
