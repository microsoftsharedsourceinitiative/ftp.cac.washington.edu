I used to run pine 4.10 on 3 sets of machines (PCs, Unix) and never once
had this problem...

I'll try the various suggestions from Nancy and yourself. Thanks.

The standard way to do it is to use the ^R command to read in the
file.  You can also press ^J in the header to attach it, or put it on the
Attchmnt: line.

I've never tried to run PC-Pine from the command line or in a batch
file...

The error message is: invalid page fault in module PINE.EXE at
0177:005d2952.  (caused while in PC-Pine)  Also, he has had 3 different
video cards, (Stealth A50, Creative Riva TNT2, Stealth III S540) in an
attempt to see if it was a video driver problem.

Thanks.

To read Micro$oft Word docs (assuming you're doing this on a unix
box), you'll need a copy of a package like StarOffice or Applix,
and a modification to your .mailcap file such as

application/msword; applixwds %s; description="MS Word document via Applix";

If you don't get these kinds of documents frequently, it's just easier
to go find a Windoze PC and read it there.  (PetPeeve: people who send
everything as an M$ Word doc by default, and who don't even know what
a text editor or plain ascii is.)

.doc files sent as attachments are often (usually?) MS Word files. As was
said previously, extract it to a file, and ftp it in BINARY mode to a PC,
and read it there in Word.

A cute trick someone showed me... if you have both a Unix account and an
MS Mail or Exchange account, forward the message to your MS account from
your Unix account, then read it on the MS account.

And it's my pet peeve, too!

Star Office is a slick little MS-Office workalike for X. Get it from
www.sun.com/staroffice. Once you have it working, add the line:

application/msword; your-path-to/soffice %s

to your ~/.mailcap file, then restart pine. Now pine will fork Star
Office to view .doc files.

Alternatively, use something like mswordview, which converts Word files to
html. It does quite a good job and it has saved me the trouble of
reinstalling vmware-NT on my desktop.

I've been having a problem similar to Mike Tibor's (per his message
below).  I'm running pine-4.10 on a solaris-7 machine.  For the
purpose of mailing .au or .wav sound files, I have the following in
my .mime.types file:

type=audio/basic        exts="au,snd"           desc="ULAW audio"
type=audio/x-wav        exts="wav"              desc="WAV audio"

... with corresponding lines in my .mailcap:

audio/basic; xplay %s; description="ulaw sound file via xplay"
audio/x-wav; xplay %s; description="wav sound file via xplay"

I can run "pine -attach puke.au ..." and the attachment Content-Type
header is correct; I get the expected audio result when I 'V' the file
in pine.

However, if I run "pine -attach mrrogers.wav ..." the Content-Type
header is messed up; it says "application/octet-stream" in spite of
the .mime.types definition for WAV files.  I don't have the 4.10 source
immediately available.  Does anyone know if there is a way to force pine
to take the .mime.types definition over whatever other method it is using
to (incorrectly) set the Content-Type for .wav files?  Or, is there
someone on this list who could put the .wav definition in their .mime.types
and then use "pine -attach" to mail me a .wav file, so I can see if that
is any better?

	i'm trying to convert netscape mails to pine mails. so, given that
there is no "BSD mbox format" (which is the one that uses netscape), can
I, at least, get pine's format? where? AND, if someone knows about a draft
about bsd mbox format, I will apreciate any suggestion.

I recently sent a message to pine-info about a problem I was having
with attaching WAV sound files to a message using pine-4.10.  I
subsequently determined that the problem is in the mime.types code
used by Pine; it appears not to be compatible with the keyed-field
mime types that are typically put into .mime.types by Netscape.
Specifically:

# the following definition in my .mime.types file works:
audio/x-wav	wav
# the following definition in my .mime.types file fails, i.e.
# Pine puts "application/octet-stream" into the "Content-Type:"
# header, rather than "audio/x-wav":
type=audio/x-wav	exts="wav"		desc="WAV audio"

Can anyone tell me if the MIME code in pine-4.21 works with the
keyed-field-style mime types?  If not, do I have the option of
getting later MIME code from somewhere and plugging that into pine?

It depends on how you look at it.  Delete takes care of those messages
without ever having to transfer the attachment from the IMAP server.

Sounds like a feature to me.  :-)

Hmmm... actually pine can use the mbox format.  You might try using ascii
mode ftp to transfer the mailbox from the pc to the unix server, since the
netscape file will have dos/win32 linebreaks.

Manual work not be good work. Use antivir and 90% of the Word files will
be deleted because they're infested with viruses. Use procmail to get
rid of the rest. Then nuke the morons who steal *my* bandwidth by using
inferior software in the first place.

	yes, was that, and you get a corrupted mbox due Content-Length:...
thanks to you, Mike. But, anyway, is there a header specification for
pine? specially about de Status and X-Satus header fileds...

Please, let's take this one offline.  This has nothing to do with Pine.

Hi,
  I'm having a slight problem with my Cyrus IMAP  server and Pine
clients setup on a Linux box... Originally we had our IMAP server
running on a spare IBM RS/6000 AIX 3.2 machine ( Cyrus IMAP version
1.5.19). Our SA (who is no longer employed here) failed to check the AIX
box for Y2K problems, and as a result on Jan 1, 2000 our mailserver
thought it was Jan 1, 1910 (and still does). Our nameless unemployed SA
failed to do anything about for a couple of weeks, and finally moved the
mail service over to a Linux box (RedHat 6.1, Cyrus IMAP 1.6.22) on Jan
19. Apparently he simply set up the server and accounts and then copied
the data files from the AIX box to the Linux box. Needless to say, all
messages received between Jan 1 and Jan 19 inclusive had a date/time
stamp of 1910. Thats where the old SA left things, without verifying
everything was correct. I use Netscape as my IMAP client and haven't had
a problem getting to any of the messages. My MS Windows NT users use
either Netscape or Eudora and haven't complained. I have several users
who use Pine (ver 4.1 and 4.21) on Linux boxes who are having problems.
The problem is:
 1) Users can access messages recieved since Jan 19 without any
problems.
 2) The messages recieved before Jan 19 have no information in the index
list (no From, no date, no size, no subject...) except a message number.
 3) If I scroll into the index list of the pre 01/19 messages (i.e.
highlight one of the "blank" messages - *highlight*, not "select" by
hitting return on the highlighted message), I get two errors, the first
is typically "Mailbox INBOX closed due to Access violation" and the
second is
"UID invalid sequence" (or something to that effect). After I get these
errors, if I select a "good" message (one from after Jan 19) I only get
the header, the message body is empty.
 4) If I select one of the "blank" messages, then it gives me an "Error
getting message <###> data" message. (<###> is the message number).

Unfortunately going back and resetting the "date" of the message file
(in /var/imap/spool/user/???) to the year 2000 and then doing a
reconstruct for that user did no good.

Any thoughts or suggestions?

John

I read the instructions at Pine help and some Pine Info archiving...

'In Pine 3.92 or later, go to the Addressbook screen, move the cursor
to the distribution list, and Forward it.  If the recipient is using
Pine 3.92 or later, they can View the attachment, then TakeAddr to
drop the list in their addressbook...'

But, I cant figure out how to get the 'takeaddr' to take.

Is there some special config setup?

Please advise.

Thank you.

Alan

No, you do not need a special configuration setting. Press V to view the
attachment and once you have put the cursor on the attachment press "S" to
save it. Press "S" again to save it to your addressbook and follow the
directions that pine will give you from there.

Thank you for the reply.
When I 'v' the attachment...
' 2    542 lines   Text/DIRECTORY, "Pine addressbook entries"'
...then 'v' and then 's, then get...
'Copy attachment to file in /home/username/work directory:'
... but '.addressbook' is in the 'username' dir.
I guess Im just missing something.
Any ideas?
Thanks again.
Alan

Guess thats the difference, 's' gets you...
'Save to address book or Export to filesystem ?'
...and I get...
'Copy attachment to file in /home/username/work directory:'

I probably need to get with the sysop, Im not on the UW system, and maybe 
need to set up some global defaults or something.
Thanks again for the help.
Let me know if you have any other ideas.
Alan

Is anyone using Nicholas Sheppard's Pine 4.21 port?

If so, is anyone using the remote addressbook facility successfully?

Ok, I tried to get the message that you mention and this is the only way I
could.

Press V to "view" the attachemt. You get a message like this:

1    5 lines   Text/PLAIN
2    7 lines   Text/DIRECTORY, "Pine addressbook entry"

If I put the cursor on the first line (the one that says text/PLAIN) and I
press "S" i get the message:

SAVE: Copy attachment to file in current directory: 

This is not what you want. Instead put the cursor on the second line (the
one that says Text/DIRECTORY). In that case I get:

Save to address book or Export to filesystem ?

Press "S" and answer the questions that pine will ask you from that
moment on.

 I hope this solves your problem.

I have a request from a user who wants to have certain email directed to a
designated directory rather than his regular inbox.  The senders of the
email would be known and cooperative.

Is there a way to set an email filter or for the mail senders to direct
email to this subaccount?

The obvious answer would be to give the person a second email account but
this is not possible.

First off, you're an idiot.  Please remove 21 of the lines in your sig.

Second, see below.  If you don't understand this, then don't ask me
questions.

Third, upgrade your copy of sendmail, it allows for open relay.

OK folks, here it is.

o  This is a procmail file, or recipe.
o  This is how to filter mail.
o  You put this file in your home directory.
o  This is used to filter email.
o  This file is called ".procmailrc"
o  One could use this to filter email.
o  Do not use the "'s
o  Filtering email is the art of putting things in different places for
   the ease of reading them.
o  This is from one of my machines. You cannot simply cut and past
   everything from my machine to yours and expect it to work.
o  People use things JUST LIKE THIS ONE to filter email.
o  You have to do some research on YOUR system to make this work
   correctly on YOUR system.


		The dotted line is not included in the file.

Set MAILDIR to wherever your want your mail stored.
You CAN _NOT_ use the ~username/mail syntax.  The full path MUST be
spelled out, ie, /home/kwoods/mail

Set DEFAULT to wherever the incoming mail is stored. 
most likely, /var/mail/username, or /var/spool/mail/username

The LOGFILE is a log, or record, of what procmail is doing with the mail. 
Useful for troubleshooting.  Again, spell out the full path. This file
will get VERY BIG, VERY quickly.  Remember to delete is every once in a
while.

You can also use PC-Pine 4.21, which has built in filtering - it's
actually quite easy to use.  Once you have it installed, type M, S, R, F
to get to the filter screen, and setup a filter.  Just have a unique
subject to make it easy to filter.

Pine is also perfectly happy filtering based on the From: line instead of
the subject.

Greetings,

I'm running Pine 4.21 (recently upgraded from 3.95) on a NeXT running
NextStep. One of our servers is running as the shell machine and another
is actually housing the users directories. 

The error is occoring on the shell machine which mounts the home
directories via NFS. The error I'm getting is "Unexpected change to
mailbox (try restarting):" followed by "MAIL FOLDER INBOX CLOSED DUE TO
ACCESS ERROR" 

This error occurs when new mail is received - so I'm assuming it's akin
the problems previously discussed on this list.

Is there a fix, or do I just have to bite the bullet and deal with it?

Do you have multiple clients trying to access the same mailbox with
POP?  I think I've seen this error when doing that.

If you can, set up an IMAP server.  At least for me, as a user, mail 
is much less likely to be messed up, and I don't have to worry about 
accessing it from multiple machines, with IMAP.

No. The problem is when sendmail tries to access the same mailbox as a
user is currently reading. This only happens on the machine in which the
mail directory (in this case /usr/spool/mail) is actually an NFS
directory. I think it's a lockfile problem, but for some reason it doesn't
happen in pine 3.95. 

I tried quelling lockfile error messages, but it doesn't seem to have
resolved the issue.

I'll look into that, but I don't think it'll work with our setup
(especially considering NextStep is 10 years old).

Thanks, any other advice? :)

Joan,

To unsubscribe, you need to send mail to the list administration address,
not the list itself.  That address is:

    listproc@u.washington.edu

In the body of the message, send

    unsubscribe PINE-INFO

I have no idea how you were added to the list in the first place.  That is
very odd, because you have to send a subscribe request, and then you have
to respond to an initial email to your address.

Hi all,
	I have a possible bug with PC-Pine 4.21.  One or two users have
reported the keyboard freezing when they are composing a long email, and
when they reboot the PC, the email is lost.  Any thoughts or help?

	Regardless, I am requesting that a new feature be added to Pine -
an AutoSave function which saves the state of your composed email every x
minutes, where x is an integer that can be configured in the pinerc file.  
It could reside in a temporary file of Pine's choosing (perhaps an
incremental temp001 in case multiple postponed messages exist as well as
the current open email).  Also, I am requesting that Pine detect the
presence of this file every time it starts, and ask the user what they
would like to do with the file (open/postpone/export).  I think Corel
WordPerfect 8 (or the currently unstable 2000) offers a good example of
this recovery feature.

	Any thoughts/additions or comments appreciated.  Also, can anyone
forward this to the Pine Dev group, or do they check this listserv?

Thanks,

Robert

Robert,

Postponed messages are already persistent.  You can shut down pine,
restart it, and all your postponed messages will be there.

A save/recover mechanism is always a good idea.

You're right.  I guess I was just thinking of a secondary measure if the
postponed messages didn't appear to be there anymore, but Pine didn't have
a record of it's deletion.

If you have a C compiler, what does it matter how old the machine is?
It only matters if it'll run at an acceptable speed for you.

Hi!
    For the record, I can't actually get PC-Pine working, but that isn't the
problem. At the
moment, it won't even load, and I don't have a clue why. I've deleted the
files and re-extracted them from the original archive and even deleted all
the registry keys relating to Pine, but the small splash screen appears, the
Pine interface loads _very_ briefly them immediately closes. This is what
the debug files has to say:

Debug output of the Pine program (debug=2 debug_imap=0). Version 4.21
Tue Feb 08 18:33:48 2000

reading_pinerc "C:\FILES\PINE\pinerc"
Read 14499 characters:
read_pinerc: pinerc_written = 950034802

Anyone any ideas (maybe it has put something in an .ini file somewhere? It's
a strange one, but I've done all I can...)
Thanks,
    George

In Unix Pine using pico as your editor, it saves a file called #picoXXXXX#
and updates it every few lines.  If it doesn't save an interrupted-message
file, you can sometimes read in that file.  I assume PC-Pine has a similar
function.

Ah, I see it now.  So all that PC-Pine doesn't do is tell you that this
file exists when you restart PC-Pine.

That'd be my guess.  I think the way Unix Pine works is that when it
detects a dropped connection, Pine writes out an interrupted-message file
for the next time you open it.  With PC-Pine, if the computer freezes,
Pine can't do anything before it's terminated or the computer is reset.  
You'll have to play around with it and figure out exactly how everything
works, but hopefully you'll be able to recover the composer's temp file.

Yes, I was able to recover the file, at least on my PC.  Do you think the
Pine Dev's would be able to add some code into PC-Pine to check to see if
Pine closed properly, and if not, open the last temp file and ask what the
user wants to do with the file?  (like I mentioned before about WP8).  
Maybe creating an option to turn this on in the pinerc?  I know Win98 also
does this, where it detects if you've booted up or shutdown properly, If
it hasn't, it goes through safe mode or runs scandisk to check the
integrity of the hard drive, respectively.

Any other thoughts?

Robert

Sounds like a good suggestion to me.

To the Pine team:

I think I understand how Unix Pine handles interrupted messages, but I'm
not sure exactly what PC-Pine does.  Can someone please explain how
PC-Pine handles interrupted messages, and whether Robert's suggestion
below is either a feature that PC-Pine is supposed to already have, or a
feature that should be added?

Thanks,

Hello ,
I am a computer science student in my final year and I am doing a project on
pine used on redhat Linux v6.0.
One of the specifications of the project is that I set-up mail filters for
pine so that the end user can filter out any mail that they don't perceive
as priority mail into other mail folders. I have tried the using Nancy
Gough's introduction to procmail to establish filters and it seems to work
fine. 
But I am wondering can you incorporate the procmail method directly into the
pine mail program allowing the end user to set-up filters from a menu
provided in pine .
I also want to incorporate the automation of forwarding mail that I have in
my inbox onto other interested groups can this be done using filtering.
Basically I want to add a mail hook that will inspect the sender of the Mail
and then forward that mail onto other users.

Thanking everyone in advance,

Kevin O' Sullivan

My .02$.

You don't need to modify pine to achieve this if you take advantage of
the *pipe* capability.
It needs to be enabled in the configurations (enable-unix-pipe-command),
but you could then write a script that reads a mail, extracts the
relevant information and appends the commands to the procmailrc.

It would, then, be nice to have a menu of available pipe commands...

Greetings,

Has anyone tried to complied it with SUN's libraries that ship with
Solaris 7 (or available for 2.6) ?

They are .so whereas the build script specifically looks for .a files...

TIA.

Building imap I modified the home directory location to point to
/var/mail/imap/USER.

What needs to be done under pine in order to accomplish the same ?  I do
notice that under the imap source distributed with pine, env_unix.c is
the file to modify, but would this only affect the shipped imap client
only ?

Also, local mail storage is being done with mbx folders.  MTA delivers
to regular unix format folder, then IMAP clients slurp that into INBOX
(which is mbx format).  Can pine handle this straight out of the box ?

Or can this be done directly via configuration files ?

TIA.

Is there anyway to have pine automatically attach a file (other than
.signature) as a mime attachement every time you compose or reply to a
message?

Thanks

Hi, I'm trying to run Pine on Digital Unix True64.  I can't find any info
about this.  No FAQs or previous posts.  So here is my problem, when I
type pine in it hangs when it tries to open your mailbox (ie it says
"Opening mailbox </>")  You have to kill -9 it to make it die.  I had had
problems with an older version of pico running on True64, but I downloaded
the newest binary version of pico and got it working.  But pine
hangs.  I've recompiled pine as du4, osf and sos and they don't work.  On
the Du4.0d machines running pine has no issues.  So I would like any info
on this.

I'm running Digital Unix 5.0 (True64), no patches on a Alpha
Workstation.  My sendmail version of 8.9.3...so like I said any info is
good info.

jz

Thank you in advance
Vincent

Go into Setup, Config and put Reply-To: in the custom headers.  You can
specify the address either in setup, config or when you compose each

Hello,

is it possible to use pine only in command-line mode.
What I mean is that pine doesn't ask me to type Ctrl-X to sent the mail.
When typing something like:=20
                   pine vosmeijer@astron.nl -attach file.x
I want the massage to be sent away without any questions (for=20
example to use it in scripts to sent some results).
Must I give another command-line option or can I set something in the =
.pinerc
so it doesn't ask any other questions ??

Regards,
Henk Vosmeijer

You really want to look at either /bin/mail, (or /bin/mailx) or sendmail
to do this.

I have the same issue and have had several suggestions, none of which were
satisfactory. Basically the problem was with the attachments. I likewise
want to script pine to include a text file and an attachment that is just
any old file and let pine decide how to handle the mime. Sendmail and
others on UNIX all split the attached file or encode it differently, or
cause other problems. That's why we like pine in the first place.

Unfortunately in order to solve this problem for an immediate need, I
resorted to doing it in Visual Basic and VBA and using Outlook as the tool
(talk about cumbersome....).

Any other solutions?

Hi everybody,

I wonder if anybody manages to define and use an addressbook on an IMAP
server. I read various instructions on this and tried it a number of times
bur the most successfull attempot resulted in a
"readonly" addressbook. Previous call to the list brought me yet anotehr
manual which did not resolve the problem.

Any help?

Hi, back again.

After asking the above question I still kept searching on the web
and I think I found the solution.

You should take a look at=20
http://www.math.washington.edu/~chappa/pine/
and try the patch for "Pine sends e-mail from the command line "

It solved my problem and I do NOT have to use sendmail or mailx !!

Regards,
Henk Vosmeijer

I have the same issue and have had several suggestions, none of which were
satisfactory. Basically the problem was with the attachments. I likewise
want to script pine to include a text file and an attachment that is just
any old file and let pine decide how to handle the mime. Sendmail and
others on UNIX all split the attached file or encode it differently, or
cause other problems. That's why we like pine in the first place.

Unfortunately in order to solve this problem for an immediate need, I
resorted to doing it in Visual Basic and VBA and using Outlook as the tool
(talk about cumbersome....).

Any other solutions?

Does this put it in your pine sent-mail mailbox?

I would LOVE to have lynx and trn send mail so that a copy was put in
my sent-mail mailbox, but I _also_ wouldn't like to have to enter my 
name/password every time I tried to send mail with one of those programs
(or type ^X to send)...

Does it also meet my requirements above?

Have you tried Nancy's directions at
< http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/pine/pc/#abookIMAP >?  If so, give
us some more detail on where things went wrong, and we should be able to
help straighten it out.

I could add a IMAP accesible addressbook following Nancy's instructions,
except that there was one point where I had to change them. Wherever it
says that you have to make it a hidden file, don't do that. I defined the
addressbook to be

Server Name : my.imap.server/user=login_name
Folder Name : name_of_the_addressbook
NickName    : nick

This creates a file called "name_of_the_addressbook" in the server which I
can use as an addressbook. You do not need to have your addressbook as a
subfolder of any collection of messages, which was the original motivation
for making it a hidden file. I could then enter any entry there. The final
thing that you get is a file which looks like a tipical folder in pine,
but it has an additional message which says it is a Pine addressbook.

I hope this helps you get through your problem, if not let us know.

I'm using pine on UNIX, but yes, I followed those as closely as possible
(someone else had said they were valid for UNIX also)..

It just ends up being a read-only addressbook, so I can't add items to it--
obviously useless.

I've been trying to get PC-Pine to work for a while (to access the account
at my University). It used to at least load fine, but I had a problem
setting up the inbox etc.

But now PC-Pine won't even load! I've tried deleting the Pine directory and
reinstalling the from the .zip, but still no luck. I've even searched
through the registry and delelted 'Pine' references... but to no avail...!

Has anyone any idea where else I should look? (Maybe in a .ini file
somewhere!?!)

Currently, the Pine screen appears VERY briefly, and dissapears, the log has
this to say (at the start):

Debug output of the Pine program (debug=2 debug_imap=0). Version 4.21
Wed Feb 16 01:38:30 2000

reading_pinerc "C:\FILES\PINE\pinerc"
Read 14499 characters:
read_pinerc: pinerc_written = 950664890

However, Pine is no longer installed in C:\FILES\PINE (but in C:\PROGRAM
FILES\PINE)

Am I missing something?
Thanks,
    George

Here's a message I just sent to the Pine Development Team.  We're very
interested in getting this fixed ASAP (and perhaps getting a workaround
before Feb. 17th) since we have to support PC-Pine for the entire
University of Washington. :)  I'll let you know what I find out.

BTW, Thanks to "Ph" for pointing out this problem.

Subject: PC-Pine 4.21 w/ Win2k - SSL Broken

This problem was recently posted to the comp.mail.pine newsgroup, and I've
confirmed it on a machine running the release version of Windows 2000
Professional.

When you install PC-Pine 4.21 either from the Winter 2000 UWICK or from
ftp.cac, it defaults to using {our.imap.host.washington.edu/ssl} as the
hostname.  This is good for Windows 9x or NT, as it adds security.  But in
Windows 2000, PC-Pine can't make SSL connections.  Whenever it tries, it
gives this error message:

Can't establish SSL session to my.imap.host.washington.edu/imaps,993

Is there any way to make PC-Pine 4.21 work with SSL on Windows 2000?  It'd
be nice to have a workaround (other than to disable SSL) before Windows
2000 ships to the public.

Just a hunch, but you may try installing it in a directory that does not
have a space in its name.

Hi everybody:
I have one question:
When I marked to delete one mail from my inbox, and expunge it from
inbox, can I just move it to a trash box, not delete it really? If I
can, how can I do for it?

Thanks

I don't think you can make it do so automatically, but you can
enable-aggregate-operations in the Setup, Config and then use:

(;)select, (S)tatus, (D)eleted, then (A)pply, (S)ave.

Or you can press S to save each one instead of deleting it.

Does this put it in your pine sent-mail mailbox?

I would LOVE to have lynx and trn send mail so that a copy was put in
my sent-mail mailbox, but I _also_ wouldn't like to have to enter my=20
name/password every time I tried to send mail with one of those programs
(or type ^X to send)...

Does it also meet my requirements above?

Pine v3.95

The question is... I have my home e-mail utility (Outlook express) grabbing
my email from my server and I specified that I want the mail to be left on
the server... this works, however all my mail gets shunted into the MAIL
directory... when at work and I use Outlook express there it won't retreive
the mail, cause it isn't located with the new mail any longer...

So... is there a way for me to get my mail from home, leave it on the server
and yet not have it moved... Pine's auto-move-read option is blank...?

Thanks

Why do you want to add a THIRD step?

marking it deleted and explunging are already two steps necessary to delete
a message.

We're running Pine 4.21 and 3.95 on Tru64 Unix 4.0b.  These were built
as os4.  No problems so far.

Is your INBOX local or on an IMAP server?

No, it used to work anyway (and I've just tried installing to C\PINE) and
it's just stopped working entirely, even if with a fresh install.

C'mon, somebody out there must be able to help!

When I first tried using an IMAP-accessible address book, I also
had "read-only" problems. The problem for me was that I had
created a *global* address book rather than a *personal* address
book. Is it possible that that is what's causing the "read-only"
problems you guys are having? The extreme frustration I had
setting this up was actually what motivated me to write my
PC-Pine web page! I've just updated my PC-Pine web page so it
now:

 * explicitly says don't create a global address book

 * does not suggest using a hidden file (because of the problem
   Eduardo mentioned)

I also just started experimenting with a cascading style sheet on
this page (and on my top Pine and Procmail Quick Start pages) so
I'd appreciate any feedback on the style (which you'll see if
you're using a browser that supports CSS).

Let us know if you figure out a solution to the IMAP-accessible
address book problem you're having. Here's a tip: Try going
through the steps on my revised page and use a completely new
name for the address book (i.e., a name that you have never used
for a folder or address book before).

Good luck,
Nancy

Well, does this affect how I *use* pine?

Will it still LOOK in all addressbooks?
Will the "A" key show me _this_ addressbook (the one on the server)?

I only use addressbooks for spam site addresses...

Yes it will, I have three different addressbooks and all of them are
searched when I enter a nick in the To: (and I assume other) fields.

The only thing "Global" means is that it's an address book designed for
multiple users to access.  As such, you're not allowed to make changes
from within Pine.

Hi,

I'm using PINE 4.10 and I ran into the following (very
annoying) problem:

I'm accessing a remote IMAP folder, from a dial-up connection. Whenever I
forget to close the folder in PINE before disconnecting, I get this
messages: "[Waited XX seconds for server reply.  Still Waiting...], where
XX changes every 15 seconds.

Then, every minute or so, I get this message (with a beep):

"Waited 60 seconds for server reply.  Break connection to server?"

Finally, if I never answer the question, after 900 seconds or so, it
breaks the connection itself.

Is there any way of disabling this "feature" ? Or setting the timeout to
something smaller, say 60 seconds (meaning that if I don't answer the
question after a minute, it closes the folder) ?

Regards,

Catalin

Subject: How do I change the web browser default?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


Ok, I can't figure it out.. How can I change the web browser default for
URLs?

I saw that I can change it at the 'view URL ....' prompt by hitting 'A', 
but that doesn't change the default.. only that one URL.

There is the 'url-viewers' item in the Setup/Config, but that
doesn't have my current URL viewer in it, and I tried simply putting 'links'
there (it now runs lynx), that didn't change anything.

The online for the url-viewers sure is confusing, IMHO.

It talks about:
  _SCHEME(scheme-list)_
      The scheme-list is a list of one or more (comma-delimited) URL
      schemes that are to be used with the associated viewer. This is the
      way to configure Pine to recognize URLs other than the built-in
      set.

Does this mean I'd put something like:

_SCHEME(http) links
in there??

Hi all,
	When I attach a document, I would like to use the
fcc-without-attachments feature, so that I don't create a 50MB sent-mail
folder every month.  However, I don't get a proper listing in PC-Pine 4.21
(don't know about regular Pine) of the file that I attached.  I copied the
email below.  The filename should've shown up as 0177-rsaltzman.txt, which
is what I attached when I sent the email.  Instead, I get the message
below, about a text segment.  I get a similar message when I attach zip
files.  Is this a bug or a feature?

	If this is just the current feature, I ask that the full path
(including network drives) be included, so that my users can tell which
file they attached.  This would be especially useful when my users have to
send out form letters (not plain text), and would like to make sure they
sent the correct one.  Also, it would be great for version control.

	If this is a bug, any hint on when it will be fixed?  (If it's me
missing something, just hit me over the head.)

Thanks,

Robert

It is a feature, however there is a way to get around this and get the
name saved:

After you have finished writing the attachment line you can add a comment
enclosed in quotes, which can tell you (and the person who receives
it) additional information about the file you are sending, so if you write
something like:

Attchmnt: /path/to/attachment "Copy of the contract in /contracts"

this information will be seen by the recipient and kept in your sent-mail
folder at the same time.

 I hope this helps,

Well, I was hoping for something a little more automatic.  It'll work for
me, but not for my users.  :(

Subject: reverse search?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
X-Listprocessor-Version: 8.1 -- ListProcessor(tm) by CREN


is there a way to do a reverse search?

I realized now that the easiest way to do it currently is
$RW
then $R when I'm done.

But I'm a lazy person and that's too many characters!! (somewhat sarcastic)

I guess I wish there were a way to declare it was a reverse search from the
Search prompt.  I realize pine is intended to be easy to use, so you can't
have different case characters (e.g. no 'w' for revers search, 'W' for
forward search)..

So some way to tell it to be a reverse search in the string... or even
an extra prompt (uggh but that gets to almost as many keys as my workaround
above) when you hit ^G just like you get at the view-url question.

Search: string?
would search for string backwards...?

Hi....

Is there any 'good way' to synchronize the global address file from SCO Unix
to SCO Unix?

Hi !

I've been asked for a way to avoid double-confirmation when posting
news with Pine. But I found no option for that. 

Does anyone know a solution ?

Hi !

I've been asked for a way to avoid double-confirmation when posting
news with Pine. But I found no option for that. 

Does anyone know a solution ?

I am a fairly new user of PINE.

Currently we are using PINE 3.96 on an IBM RS6000.

Is there a "Blind Courtesy Copy" feature available in PINE?

A "Bcc" allows you to send a Blind Courtesy Copy of the mail message.
Sending a Blind Courtesy Copy sends a Courtesy copy of a mail message 
to a user without that user knowing who else received a blind copy 
of the message.


Thanks,

After this came 4.00 etc.  The current version is 4.21 I believe ... you 
may like to ask the people who look after Pine at your site to consider 
upgrading.

Yup... Pine only shows a minimal set of headers by default to save screen 
space.  You can see all of them by putting your cursor on any of the 
headers that you CAN see and giving the "Rich Headers" command (Ctrl/R). 
This will reveal all the headers.  A second Ctrl/R will revert to just the 
default set.

If you use "Bcc:" a lot you can add it to the default set in Pine's Setup 
Configuration screen ("S" then "C" at its Main Menu screen).  Look for the 
setting called "default-composer-hdrs".  (Be sure to read its 
context-sensitive help before making any changes!)

Cheers,

Mike B-)

The only possible solution today is to apply a patch. You can find a patch
for it at

http://www.peak.org/%7Eluomat/patches/pine/4.10/diffs/send.c.DIFF

The following is an explanation given by the author about it

---
PINE puts in a Sender: or X-Sender: line which has been in several
circumstances incorrect for my usage (ie: it has supplied an address which
would not work for the purpose that the Sender: line is supposed to have).

PINE also asks you "Posted message may go to thousands of readers, really
post?" every single time you post to Usenet.  That is annoying.  So I
removed that as well.
----

Other than that, this is not a configurable option. I think I
``understood'' somehow that this question would be configurable in the
future. But I may be wrong. Therefore your only solution is a patch at
this time.

  I hope this helps,

Actually, sending a BCC sends a CC of the message to a user without adding
THAT USER to the headers.  They still see all the "normal" recipients, but
no one else sees them.  BCC yourself on a message you send to see what I
mean.

Hello.  I've read in man pages that I should add an additional mime types
in .mime.types, but there is no example of the format...  Can anyone give
me an example how to add a mime type?  Thanks.

Also, in man page it says that the default file is /etc/mime.types but
there is no such file...

For example this is the "AboutAttachment"

Details about Attachment #2 :


                Type            : Application
                Subtype         : OCTET-STREAM
                Encoding        : BASE64
                Parameters      : NAME = 23Feb.jpg
                Disposition     : ATTACHMENT; FILENAME = 23Feb.jpg
                Approx. Size    : 186,237 bytes
                Display Method  : Can't, Unknown Attachment Format


I've tried to add an 

Application/OCTET-STREAM	/usr/local/bin/xv

to the $HOME/.mime.types but that still doesn't work...
I need to change the "Display Method"

Gents

Let me clarify a little bit first.
For examples, we have two Unix servers, users are both using PINE. With
their PINE, we allow them to add their personal email addresses and we also
included one GLOBAL addressbook file. This is called GLOBAL because it
contains all the addresses for different Unix server. Meanwhile, this file
has to be synchorized in order to make sure every user in different server
can have a fresh copy of this GLOBAL addressbook.

Any good way to make it synchorized????

Thanks.

Regards,
Houghton

Gents

 Let me clarify a little bit first.
For examples, we have two Unix servers, users are both using PINE. With
their PINE, we allow them to add their personal email addresses and we also
included one GLOBAL addressbook file. This is called GLOBAL because it
contains all the addresses for different Unix server. Meanwhile, this file
has to be synchorized in order to make sure every user in different server
can have a fresh copy of this GLOBAL addressbook.

 Any good way to make it synchorized????

 Thanks.

 Regards,
Houghton

If you use Seth Kurtzberg's .mime.types, that should solve your
problem.  BTW you should be aware that there is more than
one format for .mime.types and the newer format can cause problems
with pine.  (I'm running pine 4.10.)

Apparently netscape alters .mime.types to suit its fancy, putting
"key=value" items in the file.  I found that this format did not work
for .wav files, I had to go back to the positional-field form:

# for WAV files, the verbose form "type=..." didn't work
audio/x-wav     wav
#type=audio/x-wav       exts="wav"              desc="WAV audio"

The "application/octet-stream" is a generic type for binaries which
weren't recognized when sent.  It's probably not a good idea to
assign an action to that type.

I have a couple of quick questions about attachment handling in PC-Pine.
Say I attach a file to a message, postpone the message, make changes to
the attached file, and later send the message.  Does the recipient
get the original attachment file, or the changed one?  If the
former, where does Pine put the copy it makes?

I notice that when I attached a file, Pine gave the attachment size as
2.1 Kb.  However, when I later sent the message, without having edited
the attached file at all, Pine gave the attachment size as 2.8 Kb.
Could someone explain what's happening here?

Thanks,
James

I get many URLs sent to me Nando that look like this:

http://www.nando.net/noframes/story/0,2107,500174350-500226187-501065781-0,00.html

For some reason, even though almost all other URLs work for me in pine,
these always return an error message when I enter them.

I think the problem is caused by commas in the file name.  I'm running
pine 4.21 on Solaris 2.6.  Here is the relevant section of my .pinerc:

# List of programs to open Internet URLs (e.g. http or ftp references).
url-viewers="/opt/netscape/netscape -noraise -remote openURL\\(_URL_,\\ new-window\\)"

Is it possible to do this better, e.g., putting _URL_ in single quotes, or
somethign like that?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

Mike

   I don't think this will help, as it is netscape will be still confused


my url-viewers like invokes a wrapper script
    url-viewers="/home/dcd/bin/urln '_URL_'"

It's a perl script that changes the commas to %2C like
    s/,/%2C/g;

When I get into netscape the url is

Good idea.  For those not familiar with this concept, see here:
http://www.december.com/html/spec/esccodes.html

Then Ed Arnold <era@ucar.edu> sent me an sh script that evokes netscape.  
Ed's script worked on his Solaris 7 system, but it gave me the same
problem with commas that I was having before.  So I combined David's
string substitution idea (using sed instead of perl) with Ed's script and
came up with something that worked for me.  I'm really happy with this
solution because it seems to work every time.  Thanks very much to both of
you for helping with this!

The script is appended below.  To make it work, edit the path to netscape,
copy it to a directory such as /usr/local/bin and name it 'ns' (for
example), chmod a+x ns, and change the url-viewers line in your .pinerc
appropriately, for example:

# List of programs to open Internet URLs (e.g. http or ftp references).
url-viewers=/usr/local/bin/ns

Subject: decoding binhex files on the fly

I run pine 4.21 on a unix sun solaris system.  I get MS Word files as
attachments, which I may want to forward to other users or )someday) view
myself uisng staroffice.  When they come from a mac, they often have
binhex 40 encoding.  I find if I forward them -- especially to PC users --
they cannot handle them.  I found from the FAQ about uudeview, and it
seems to work -- decoding the files manually.

My question: is it possible to get pine to decode binhex 40 files
automatically?  I cannot envision a reason for keeping them in that
format.

Thanks in advance,

Arthur Snoke
