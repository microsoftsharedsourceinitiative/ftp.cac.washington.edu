Subject: IMAP Working Group Meeting: Summary and Minutes


             IMAP Working Group  --31st IETF (San Jose)
                    Tues 6 Dec 1994, 1600-1800

SUMMARY

Meta-summary: we have declared victory and are ready to move on.

Last week the IESG approved the latest IMAP4 draft as a Proposed Standard.
Accordingly, the original charter objectives of the working group have 
been accomplished and no further IMAP working group meetings are planned.

Several pending extension proposals and informational documents will continue
to be worked-on informally, and in due course will be advanced as
appropriate.  Likewise for the companion support protocol (IMSP).  The
imap@cac.washington.edu email list will remain available to facilitate these
activities. 

MINUTES

Status of the latest (version 7) draft of the IMAP4 spec:

 o IESG has approved draft 7 as a Proposed Standard
 o It is not known how soon the RFC based on draft 7 will be published,
   due to backlog in the RFC Editor's queue.

Discussion of IMAP4 implementation experience:

 o Both IMAP server implementors mentioned that their first 
   implementations of the extended searching in IMAP4 were wrong.
 o Sun has a disconnected IMAP client (ROAM) that does not yet
   use IMAP4 UIDs for resynchronization (they started before the
   spec was stable).  They will upgrade when the IMAP4 c-client
   library becomes available.

Discussion of disconnected use implementation experience and Rob 
Austein's draft on message cache resynchronization using IMAP4:

 o The Sun folks indicated that IMAP has served them very well for their 
   nomadic/disconnected mail client.
 o Rob's document needs some additional review, and could benefit by some 
   additional implementation wisdom.  (Bill Yeager to review by 
   end-of-year.)
 o This document is informational, not standards-track.

Discussion of previously proposed extensions:

(These would all use the IMAP4 CAPABILITY mechanism for negotiating 
extensions, and would be standardized independently of the base protocol.)

 o STATUS
   -Universally accepted as a Good Idea.
   -Already implemented in the CMU Cyrus server.
   -Additional practical experience desired before advancing the doc.

 o ANNOTATE
   -Document needs to include the "silent" form of STORE.
   -Document needs to state that annotations don't change
    RFC822 content.
   -Additional feedback solicited.

 o Protocol timeout negotiation for dialup clients.
   -Proponents (Austein/Klensin) need to write proposal.

 o Binary
   -The Wollongong Group will be doing this.
   -Draft extension and implementation to follow.

 o Non-ascii mailbox names
   -John Myers (CMU) presented a proposal that is a compromise between 
    the two that have been discussed on the mailing list.  There seemed to be
    broad support for John's approach, which he will write-up and submit 
    to the list shortly. 

Interrupt handling. Bill Yeager (Sun) argued that the ability to interrupt a
long server response (e.g. via TCP Urgent) is invaluable when using low-speed
lines. This facility requires an extension to the protocol.  Yeager and
Crispin to discuss further. 

Latest PEM/MIME draft.  The question was raised as to whether the latest 
PEM/MIME draft had any impact on IMAP.  The answer was: everything should 
work OK as is, but there might be an opportunity for performance 
optimization via a future extension to IMAP.

Namespace draft.  The IMAP4 spec leaves a "hook" for multiple namespace
identifiers (The "#" symbol at the beginning of a mailbox name.) A document
needs to be published on how this might/should be used.  It is not yet clear
whether this would take the form of an informational "conventions" document,
or whether it might even lead to a protocol extension proposal. 

IMSP.  The companion support protocol to IMAP (providing such services 
as user-to-server binding in a large site) is evolving, but not yet ready 
for standardization.  

Procedure for extensions becoming standards.  As any of the above
extension proposals reach maturity, they will be brought to the attention
of the area director(s), and a decision will be made then as to whether a
(hopefully short-lived) working group should be chartered, or whether an
"extended last call" might be sufficient to obtain feedback/consensus.
This decision will be made on a case-by-case basis. 

Working group wind down.  The original WG charter objectives were achieved
with the approval of IMAP4 draft7 as a Proposed Standard (and *only* a year
behind the original schedule!).  Further, the WG does not need to persist in
order for extensions to be brought forward.  Accordingly, it was agreed that
this should be the last IMAP Working Group meeting, and that the IESG should
decommission the IMAP Working Group.
