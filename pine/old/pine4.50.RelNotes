                        Version 4.50 (built 2002-11-20)
                          University of Washington
                                      
   Pine(R) is the University of Washington's "Program for Internet News and
   Email". It is intended to be an easy-to-use program for sending,
   receiving, and filing Internet electronic mail messages and bulletin
   board (Netnews) messages. There are versions that will run on many
   different flavors of the Unix(R) operating system, as well as a version
   with GUI amenities for 32-bit flavors of Microsoft Windows (95, 98,
   NT, 2000, Me, and XP).
   
New in Pine 4.50

   Version introduces some new functionality and addresses bugs found in
   earlier releases.
   
   Additions include:
   
     * Threading support
          + Threading display styles configurable
            (Threading-Display-Style)
          + Threading index styles configurable (Threading-Index-Style)
          + Options to affect threading display,
            "Threading-Indicator-Character",
            "Threading-Expanded-Character", and
            "Threading-Lastreply-Character"
          + Feature to color thread index lines the same color as the
            Important symbol "thread-index-shows-important-color"
          + Feature to make slash command collapse whole thread instead
            of just the subthread at current line
            "slash-collapses-entire-thread"
          + Feature to keep Pine from asking you about Next and Prev
            commands when they move you to another thread
            ("next-thread-without-confirm"
     * Rule Pattern enhancements
          + Non-terminating Filter Rules
          + New option in Rule Patterns to match message body text but
            not headers
          + "Not" ("!") operator in Header patterns, AllText patterns,
            and BodyText patterns
          + New option in Rule Patterns to match messages of a certain
            age
          + New option in Rule Patterns to match messages with raw 8-bit
            characters in the Subject (Raw 8-bit in Subject)
          + New option in Rule Patterns to match messages which have a
            From or Reply-To address which is in your address book (more)
          + New option in Rule Patterns to match messages which are
            Recent
          + If Patterns contain elements that are unrecognized, most
            likely because they are from a version of Pine which is newer
            than the Pine that is running, Pine will not act on them.
            _WARNING_: If you are using a version of Pine which is 4.50
            or newer and also using a version which is older than 4.50
            you should probably read this additional information.
     * New option to use a role-based SMTP server
     * Rudimentary support for converting a message in a character set
       different from yours to your character set when displaying the
       message (more). The old, broken ISO_TO_CP and CP_TO_ISO hooks have
       been removed.
     * Rudimentary support for ISO-2022-JP. Uses EUC for UNIX Pine with
       terminals that understand how to display EUC, and uses Shift-JIS
       for PC-Pine (more).

       opened.
