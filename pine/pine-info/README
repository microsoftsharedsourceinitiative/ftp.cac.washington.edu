  Archive of Discussion on the Pine-Info mailing list
 -----------------------------------------------------

Pine-Info is a mailing list established for discussion of the email
program Pine.  While unmoderated, it is intended primarily for discussion
of matters of interest to systems/email administrators, developers,
trainers, user support personnel, and others involved with Pine messaging
on a "technical" level.  New releases, fixes and versions of Pine are
announced here, too. 

If you would like to join the Pine-Info list, send email to
listproc@u.washington.edu with the line "subscribe pine-info YourName" 
(without the quotation marks) in the body of the message, where YourName
is your full name.  Questions about the Pine-Info mailing list can be sent
to pine-info-owner@u.washington.edu. 

The Pine-Info mailing list used to be mirrored in the newsgroup
comp.mail.pine - meaning, messages sent to the mailing list appeared in
the newsgroup, and messages posted to the newsgroup were sent to the
mailing list. In the summer of 1997, this gateway (like the newsgroup, not
maintained by the University of Washington) between the mailing list and
the newsgroup became non-operational, and the mailing list and newsgroup
have remained separate discussion forums thereafter. To read expired
comp.mail.pine postings since then, you can use DejaNews (which allows you
to restrict archive searching to one or more specified newsgroups with a
Search Filter). 

This directory holds all Pine-Info messages since February of 1993.  
It is updated every night.  Each file is a plain-text, Berkeley (up to
June 1996) or Tenex (after June 1996) format email folder.  
Many messages in the archive are in MIME format.

The archives of Pine-Info (though not going back as far as 1993) 
are also available in HTML format, with searchable index, in the 
Pine Information Center on the World Wide Web at the URL:
	http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/

Use of these message archives for the compilation of email address lists
for commercial purposes is prohibited (Chapter 42.17 RCW).
