Hello Alex,
 The cursor keys work in vi because vi doesn't need ^J, ^K, ^L and ^H for
anything else where Pine uses then for justify, kill line, redraw and
destructive backspace. There's really not much you can do about this other
than hack the code to rebind these functions to obscure control keys like
^_, ^^, ^\ and ^@ so you can use those control keys for the arrow keys. 
... but watch out for future versions of Pine/Pico that use those keys
too.  There's a real shortage of control keys. 

I think there was someone that made these changes once. If they've got 
'em in the form of patches I think they could be included as contributed 
additions in the Pine source. (send them to pine@cac.washington.edu, as 
MIME attachments of course).

Hi Laurence,

I once hacked Pine 3.05 source so that we could use a Televideo terminal
(of which we have dozens). These generate ^J,^K,^L,^H for
down,up,right,left arrow, and can't be reprogrammed (as far as we know).

My hack involved sacrificing attach(by keystroke)/justify, kill-line,
redraw-screen and del-with-^h; annoying but still giving most of Pine's
functionality to people cursed by these museum pieces. Speaking of curses,
people tell me that "Curses" could somehow solve this sort of problem. 

I have the fixed source files if they are of any help to anyone.

Mike

I am considering setting up PC Pine for a group of very important people at this

running PC Pine with Novell's WFD TCP/IP, either PPP or SLIP, & a dialin modem.
At my end I am considering a terminal server which supports PPP or SLIP, such as
an Annex Three.

Is PC Pine up to the task?   Would you put your governing council types onto
it?  What about with dialin PPP/SLIP?  Any pitfalls to such a setup?

Anyone running Novell's WFD TCP/IP and Annex boxes?

If this is the scenario we go, I would have less than 3 man days to make it

I don't know if this is the right list or not, but here goes.  Does Pico
have an overwrite mode so that you can write over text and not insert
characters onto a line?  We have users filling out a form in Pine for
forwarding to an id for processing, we would like to have the people
be able to type in the fields directly and not have the text shifting
across the screen as they add characters.

This is the same setup we are running here (more or less)...Our Annex server
runs the Xylogics Annex Command Interpreter and has PPP/SLIP support.  We
would be VERY intersted as to whether or not people dialing in and telling
their workstations to talk SLIP could process their mail via IMAP from
their PC...

Later...

No problem, as long as you have a fast modem (we use 14.4kbps).  We have
users here using a very similar configuration.  I would set up a trial for
yourself for a few days just to get comfortable with it before trashing
the council's PCs though ;^)

Within minutes of installing our first copy of PC Pine on a public PC, a
user asked to try it out. Sending a short test message to himself, we
noticed that my mail address and personal name were used on the From line
despite the fact the user entered his own name and password to the IMAP
server. He commented on the need for this ``feature'' and happy walked
away with a copy of the software.  That got me worrying about deliberate,
as well as unintentional, forging of electronic mail addresses.

The reason for my mail address and personal name being used was because
that's what appeared in the C:\pine\pinerc file of the publicly accessible
machine.  The password verification of user identity by IMAP is only for
reading mail on the remote server and is totally independent of SMTP
which sends the mail from the PC.

While the -p option does allow different users to use a different pinerc
file, how do you insure the correct user mail address appears on mail sent?
The Receive by: line naming the sending PC address is not enough.

Short of forcing PC users to Telnet to the Suns for mail (eliminating PC
Pine totally), what can I do??

Otherwise, how can I block SMTP connections from PCs on my Suns?

I agree that some POP/IMAP mailers do have this problem. I think the
answer is to force the mailer to always use the usercode the person
logged in as in the From line - but to supply a Reply-To header so the
user can do some rewriting if they need to.

As far as security goes - this really doesn't add much, if an IMAP/SMTP
client does the right thing, there's still nothing to stop the user from
directly sending "forged" mail via other means - except ignorance (which
does work for 99% of them ;-).

> Otherwise, how can I block SMTP connections from PCs on my Suns?

Get log_tcp wrapper (use archie) - it allows you to control what nodes
can connect to your SMTP servers. I use it extensively here - but you
really need a firewall as well to tighten things up...

I have personally used PC Pine via SLIP on a variety of platforms, even a XT

It works.

However, I'm not sure that I would recommend my particular setup to VIPs.
This doesn't have anything to do with Pine, but rather on how clunky it is to
set up SLIP on a PC.  If someone knows of a non-rocket science means to set up
a SLIP link on the PC for packet-driver applications, I'd like to hear of it!

Uh, one small problem with this.

Presumably, the ``confirmed data'' is the POP login id and the POP service
host.  That information may be sensitive, and certainly should not be
disclosed unless the program is configured to do so.

Also, if I were a bad guy there is nothing that keeps me from putting the
string ``(confirmed)'' after the address in a bogus From that I generate.

This isn't to say that Pine's present behavior, which practically encourages
the wrong thing to be sent, is right.

Once someone knows how to forge SMTP mail, that additional field makes 
very little difference.  It is true that it is slightly easier to forge 
email on PC-pine, but I feel that something like putting "(confirmed)" on 
a header will lead to more of a false sense of security than actual security.

We will be working on changes to make it less likely to inadvertantly 
send email with the wrong return address from "multi-user" PCs.

Some of you may know that Qualcomm has taken over development of Eudora and we
will actually be marketing it soon. I use Pine and Eudora both. Anyway, Eudora's
situation is similar to PC Pine's in that someone could walk up to my machine,
load up either program, and send mail all they want under my name. Eudora
however sees that my Unix password was never entered and automatically puts the
(uncomfirmed) addition in the header. You cannot fake this by typing (confirmed)
in, because Eudora will still but the uncomfirmed section in after it. It's not
something you can delete from the header, since Eudora never shows that part to
the sender.

At any rate, we have about 700 people here using Eudora and have had ALMOST NO
problems with this at all, so I dont think it's a huge issue. The unconfirmed
addtition is a nice security option though.

We've been trying to decide exactly what path to take with PC-Pine, and
this is very helpful input!  It's not an easy problem to solve. 

To make sure I understand, does Eudora require the mailbox in the From
address to match the login's userid before "(confirmed)" is inserted?  A
couple of valid situations where they reasonably wouldn't come to mind. 
In the particular case of a system administrator, list maintainer or
help-desk consultant, an "(unconfirmed)" label might be less than ideal. 
If the match isn't required, well...

At one point we considered putting the login userid/server pair into an
"X-Sender" header line.  It might have helped to trace bogus mail back to
an account, but the downside is advertising the imap account with every
sent message.  This didn't seem ideal either. 

As it stands now, PC-Pine generates message ID's with the PC's name or IP
address.  Along with Received entries this is helpful, but of course in a
lab environment is of questionable value.  Whatever the solution, we'd
like to keep it innocuous enough so the motivation for snipping it out
after the source release is low. 

Further, to diminish the likelihood of accidental forging, the upcoming
release will quite likely have the auto-save of requisite user data
disabled.

Basically, when you first enter Eudora it asks for the password of the username
listed in Eudora's configuration file (eudorarc if you will). If you choose to
cancel when the password window appears, any messages sent will have the
"unconfirmed" text in the header. If the password is entered, this goes away.
Eudora also has the option, and I think this is what I'd like to see in PC Pine,
it has the option to "forget password". So if you're sending mail and need to
leave for lunch or whatever, you can select forget password and the unconfirmed
message comes back. Eudora will also not recieve any mail unless the password is entered.

Hope this helps!

On checking Eudora (Mac) I see that my assertion that "either (confirmed)

comment that appears is (unconfirmed) when a POP login has not taken place
with the userid being used in that From: field.

With current discussions on poland-l@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu and
soc.culture.polish it is evident that after more than 3 years
of being connected to the world community Polish e-mail readers
feel the need to use an 8-bit e-mail.
Pine suits our needs :-)
To remain compatible we would need a filter implemented in pine
which translates ISO 8859-2 into ASCII.

I am aware that version 3.85 is imminent. Whom should I contact ?
I am willing to work on this filter (set up appropriate tables,
or whatever is necessary :-).

Hi,

I've just started using Pine and I've got a problem when sorting mail into
folders.

I'm connecting using the imapd and I'm running 3.07 on an Sun running
SunOS 4.1.3.

Here's the problem:

I'm reading mail in my inbox and I decide to save a message in a separate
folder. I hit the 's' key and I get prompted for a folder name. I've got
the 'elm-style-save' option on so I see a suggested name in []. I decide I
want to put the mail in a different folder so I hit ^T to see the folder
names and I select one. I'd expect to see the message refiled there but it
ends up in a folder of the same name in my home directory. If I supply the
folder name manually, I get the same behaviour.

Changing to a different folder either by using ^T and selecting a folder
or typing in the name works fine.

I've included my .pinerc file and /usr/local/lib/pine.conf. Is this a
known problem? Am I just doing something stupid? It would appear that a
'change directory to the Mail folder' is missing somewhere.

I've just switched from a long commitment to mh and xmh and I like what I
see with pine.

Thanks for your help,
andy

I'm seeing the exact same problem.  Hadn't reported yet because I hadn't
checked it out in detail yet.

Andy and Billy,
Part of the problem is that Elm's behavior is somewhat surprising in that 
if you override the default (and don't put in an "=" token) it saves to 
the home (actually, the current) directory.  Pine emulates this, when 
"elm-style-save" is enabled, although doesn't support the "=" shorthand.

The anomoly about selecting a name from the folder menu and having that 
end up in the home directory sounds like a true bug...

However, both these problems go away in version 3.85, due later this month, 
with the introduction of the concept of "folder collections."  (PC-Pine 3.84
users have this facility now.)

No doubt it's staring me in the screen, but I can't _see_ any way with
the Export command to overwrite an existing file rather than

Is this supposed to work?  I've tried every syntax I can come up with and
searched through all the documentation I can find, but the most I can do
(aside from access my inbox) is access a single folder at a time with
"incoming-folders=" option in PINERC.  What I need to do is use the folder
collections ability but everytime I try to click on it within pine all I
ever get is: 

         [ *** Empty List *** Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]

The syntax I understand to use (from the docs) in PINERC is:

  remote-folders  {remote-node-name}Mail[]

where "Mail" is the subdirectory in my account where the normal UNIX
pine folders exist.  I've tried {rnn}/users/mike/Mail[], {rnn}Mail/[*],
{rnn}Mail[*], etc etc.

How do I get a list of remote folders???

I can't seam to read news at all either despite many attempts.  Same
message as above.

What version of the IMAP server are you running?

PC Pine requires the latest version.  Earlier versions may not work properly.

What syntax are you trying to use to access news?  Are you trying to access
news via NNTP or IMAP?

Mike,
The incoming-folders variable is a list of *individual* folder names,
in contrast to the folder-collections and news-collections variables
which take a list of *collections*.  The idea is that all of the
incoming folders together (plus INBOX) constitute a single collection.

So you can have
 incoming-folders= {host}Mail/foo, {host}Mail/bar
or 
 folder-collections= {host}Mail/[*]

Send us the relevant .pinerc entry for news-collections and we'll try to 
help on the news problem.

I got the remote folder collection working, but news will not work... I 
get the same message

>          [ *** Empty List *** Select Here to Try Re-Expanding ]

I am the news admin, so I tweaked with permissions to read-only (no 
posting) and posting allowed, same thing (though with the former, I did 
see the 201 message from NNTP in the stat line saying no posting).

My pinerc looks like...

# One or more collections where saved messages are stored. 
#The first one is the default collection for saves.  For example:
# folder-collections=PC-folders      C:\MAIL\[],
#                     Carson-folders  {carson.u.washington.edu}mail/[]
folder-collections={pima.dtcc.edu}Mail/[*]

# One or more collections of news folders (e.g. *{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}[])
news-collections=*{apache.dtcc.edu/nntp}[]

The collection definitions look fine from here.  What's your NEWSRC look
like, and where's it located on the PC's disk? 

Effectively, the folder for an NNTP-accessed collection is built from the
list of subscribed groups in the NEWSRC.  Pine uses common "rn" notation,
so ftp'ing a .newsrc from a UNIX account to the root of pine's working
drive (or directory pointed to by the "HOME" environment variable) should
be enough. 

For now, all subscription maintenance has to be done external to pine, but
an upcoming version (not the one scheduled for later this month, though)
will have this support fleshed out. 

Alternatively, just opening a newsgroup for reading can be done by typing
a newsgroup name at the "goto" command prompt with the news collection
selected.  It won't get the newsgroup into the NEWSRC, but it will tell us
if NNTP from the PC is working. 

Hope this helps!

The problem here seemed to be that I was using an older version
of imapd, I just compiled the new one and willtest extensively at
work tomorrow (as the waterloo IP package you all used in PCPINE doesn't
like going through my home router based on PCROUTE!)

So the IMAPD process won't read the .newsrc file in the home directory
of my UNIX acct remotely?  I have to FTP a .newsrc file to the c:\PINE
directory on the PC?  if so, what do I call it ("NEWSRC")?

With the new imapd, I'll try it tomorrow.

You know, we have never gotten PINE at our site to do news!  We run
INN v1.2 on a DECstation with 'nn' and 'tin' news reader, with
several UNIX clients.  Yet, when I try "g" and type for instance:
"/news/spool/comp/os/vms" (a valid newsgroup) I get "Unknown file format"
everytime.  I have symbolic links for /usr/lib/news (for ACTIVEFILE
def in os_ult.h) and /usr/spool/news (for NEWSSPOOL def in os_ult.h).

...what am I doing wrong?

Select the news collection in the folder lister, type "g" and type a 
newsgroup with the syntax "comp.os.vms".  That should test the NNTP part 
of it.

This is incorrect.

imapd *WILL* read the .newsrc file in the home directory of the UNIX account
remotely, if you open a news connection using IMAP.

However, if you open a news connection using NNTP, the newsrc data must reside
on the client (that is, on the PC if you are using PC Pine).

Note that there is a bug in the distributed version of PC Pine having to do
with getting a list of newsgroups in an IMAP-based news collection.  This bug
has been fixed, but I don't think that version of PC Pine has been released
yet.

These features are not yet in the distributed version of UNIX Pine.

Try G followed by *comp.os.vms


Also, you'll be pleased to know that the IMAP toolkit (mail/imap.tar.Z on
ftp.cac.washington.edu) now includes patch files and instructions for
installing shadow password capability for Ultrix and SUN-OS.

Got this to work, almost...

Just tried following first...


# One or more collections of news folders (e.g. *{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}[])
news-collections=*{apache.dtcc.edu/imap}[]

It sat for a while, then bombed with a "Bug detected in Pine, can't resize
memory" or similar error (I have a very large Unix .newsrc file, but it
is still ungraceful!)

I then altered it to

news-collections=*{apache.dtcc.edu/imap}[dtcc*]

... to pick up our local newsgroups (around 7). It then came back with a 
list of groups which were correct, but when I tried to select one, it said...

no such bboard: {apache.dtcc.edu/imap}dtcc.weather

Any mail sent from PCPINE 3.84a arrives with a header than UNIX PINE (3.07)
seems a little confused by.  The from-field in the list of messages
says "To: " and the address the mail message was sent to rather than
the PC's nodename or at least the Personal Name.  If I go into ugly old
UNIX 'mail' and do an 'h' the from field is more or less what it should
be in the list (says username@<pinedomain name> which I have set to
"mike@cbl.umd.edu" our email server).

Any ideas?

My apologies for the previous "test" mail from me - it's late and I mailed the

No.  The remote addressbook issue is something that is going to be 
addressed in Pine 4.0, due out this fall, but it is not available yet.  
There will certainly be support for IMSP addressbooks and quite possibly 
for CCSO based addressbooks.  The details of how to handle them have not 
been worked out yet.

Ack!  More acronyms!  Yea, haven't heard of IMSP/CCSO, these proposed

Yup, more acronyms! ;^)

IMSP is the Interactive Mail Support Protocol and is being developed by 
John G. Meyers at Carnegie Mellon University.  It is indeed on the 
standards track.  There is currently an alpha-release of a server 
available and the "standard" is still changing.

CCSO is a nameserver developed by the Computer and Communications 
Services Office (hence the acronym) or the University of Illinois at 
Urbana.  It is in fairly wide use and can also be interfaced to mail 
delivery agents for name resolution.

This does not sound surprising.  When you are in Pine (any Pine) and
looking at the index of messages in a folder, Pine will tell you who
the message is from.

However, if Pine detects that the message sender (From: line) is the
same person as the person currently running Pine, then Pine tells you
who the message is to, not from.  This is helpful when looking at the
FOLDER INDEX of a sent-mail folder.  It also helps point out messages
which you wrote.

It sounds like you have the user-id and domain set the same for both
Pine and PC-Pine, so they detect that messages sent from either plat-
form are really from you.  To test the theory and verify that PC-Pine
messages are in fact OK, use PC-Pine to compose a message to somebody
other than yourself.  Have that other person use UNIX Pine 3.07 to
view the message and see what comes up.

This is definitely a bug.  I'll call it to my co-worker's attention.

This is a known bug in the current distribution version of PC Pine.  It is
fixed in the development sources, so it will be fixed when the source release
is made.

Subject:  Problems with Imap 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.3 (OS-MP 4.1b)?
Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail/Mac v2.02
Status: RO
X-Status: 

I am trying to make the latest imapd.tar.Z from cac.washington.edu on a 
Solbourne running OS-MP 4.1b (Sun OS 4.1.2 + some of 4.1.3).  I have tried 
both gcc and normal non-ANSI cc with the following results:

During the make, everything works fine until the following line.  After 
which, the whole make blows up:

cd ../c-client;make
cc -g -Dconst=  -target sun4 -c  mbox.c
"mbox.c", line 179: syntax error at or near type word "slock"
"mbox.c", line 184: syntax error at or near type word "slock"
"mbox.c", line 208: syntax error at or near type word "slock"
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `mbox.o'

(none of the rest of the make works at all)

Anyone have any ideas?  I thought that Imap 3.0 was supposed to make under 
SunOS just fine?  In fact, several people have told me that it does.

Thanks!

Mark

I did not have this problem on our SUN-OS 4.1.3 system.

My guess is that on your system the token ``slock'' is defined as something.
In mbox.c, it is a temporary character array.

My suggestion is to change all occurances of ``slock'' to some other word, and
see if that fixes the problem.

I'm using pine 3.07. It'd be nice to be able to:
 
     q quit from the folder screen
     i index (on highlighted folder) from the folder screen
     not have pine say [Unknown command: "f"] from folder screen (just
          ignore the "f" there)
     not have pine say [Unknown command: "m"] from the main menu
          (again, ignore it)
 
Minor points, granted, but they would polish the operation of pine a bit.

Subject: PC-Pine as DOS App. Within Windows?

Do readers of this list have wisdom to share about starting
PC-Pine 3.84 under MS-Windows as a DOS application and then running it
in the background such that email notification parts of PC-Pine work?

Subject: forwarding agents too compliant
Reply-To: ram@cs.umb.edu

Recognizing that I'm compounding the problem with my citation	, I'd
like to throw out an observation and ask whether any existing or
contemplated mechanisms address it, either in the Pine community or
elsewhere. The message below arrived here with (at least) 2268
characters, counting the 80 bytes of consequential content. No doubt
it went to hundreds or thousands of recipients.

About 2/3 of the uninteresting bytes are RFC-822 fields, about 1/3 is
the user's signature file. So my question is this: are there mail
forwarding agents and protocols which say something like: "I've thrown
away N bytes of header and M bytes of content and am forwarding this
message without authentication". A lot of mailing lists would benefit
from this. (I am not talking about presenting less to the user. Like
most competent mailers, Pine can do this. I'm talking about automatically
_forwarding_ less than the received message).

It is certainly possible to configure the list exploder to remove pieces
of the message, and, for that matter, to configure mail transport agents
to do the same.  However, the Host Requirements RFC requires that each
transport agent along the way adds a Received line, and 99% of the mail
administrators on the Internet would be upset if they weren't there.  All
those header lines are about all you have to go on when there is a
problem, and there *is* is problem. 

   Received lines are our friends,

On original ListServer a user can get either:
- SHORT headers (ListServer strips everything), so
  one gets only headers on route from ListServer
- FULL headers (ListServer passes everything untouched).

David,

In May and June, we did some changes to try to make Pine's user interface
as good as it can be.  I don't think it is a coincidence that three of
the four things you mention were fixed at that time.

The only one we left (after *much* discussion) was:
>     i index (on highlighted folder) from the folder screen

There is an inherent dilemma in the FOLDER LIST (new name for folder
screen):  Users need to be able to choose a new folder, but they also
need to be able to change their minds and stick with the folder they
were in before.  In the newest version of Pine (3.84/3.85, due out real
soon now), you press "v" or <enter> to get to the index of the currently
highlighted folder.  You press "i" to get to the index of the folder
which was open when you started with the FOLDER LIST.

Subject: pine error on "about to end_tty_driver"



Hello,
 Using Pine 3.05 under SunOS 4.1.x (I think it is 4.1.3, but I'm
not sure.), I keep on getting the following error:

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
Floating exception

It occurs when I am switching views from one piece of mail to the
next in the queue. All the .pine-debug# files report "about to
end_tty_driver", but only some have "Pine Panic: Received abort
signal" after that.

I have included a pine-debug file for reference, but there doesn't
seem to be any other info than what I have already written.

So, the question is, is this a known bug? Is it a bug in pine or in
SunOS? If pine, is it fixed in 3.07 or will it be fixed in the
upcoming general release? If SunOS, is there a fix or a workaround
available?

Thankyou,
shy aberman

What format does Waffle store messages in?  We are looking at writing a 
driver for QWK format message stores.  If Waffle uses QWK then we will 
probably be supporting it in a future release.  If not, do you have 
specifications for how it stores incoming/outgoing mail?

I've been suggested to contact you in regards to porting Pine on to the DG
platform.  Has this been done yet? or are their any plans to provide this port
in the future?  Please let me know.

Thanx!!

Actually, it has bee brought to my attention that you should also check 
with the pine-info list to see if someone has done a port that they 
haven't told us about.  The list address is 
pine-info@cac.washington.edu.  To subscribe to pine-info, send a note to 
majordomo@cac.washington.edu with "subscribe pine-info" in the body of 
the message.

Bingo.  I had thought I had introduced a new bug when I did the port to 
ISC.  Now I'm not so sure.  I notice that the subject: header states 
"Re: your mail", instead of whatever subject line it started with. I wonder 
if anyone else has noticed this?  I'm also using pine 3.05

Pardon me if this is a FAQ, but is there a conflict with Sun NIS aliases? 
When I send mail to an alias that is defined in NIS, say 'group', the
address gets filled in as group@mymachine.  I get an error from sendmail
that says it doesn't recognize the user.  However, if I use the regular
/usr/ucb/mail or /bin/mail the mail goes through.  If I log into my mail
server to use pine, it never seems to have the problem.

Indexed MMDF - four ^A's separate each message, and there's an
additional index file to save time when sorting large mail folders.

The inbox is named 'mailbox.f', and is in the user's home directory,
accompanied by the index file, named 'mailbox.i'.  Any other mail
folders are also kept in the home directory, and named *.f and *.i.

I haven't tried to figure out what the format of the index files is -
I own a source license so it could be reverse-engineered.

The location of the root of the user home directory tree (as well as a
few other pertinent things) is stored in the Waffle configuration
file, which is pointed to by the WAFFLE environment variable.

These characteristics are true of both the DOS and UNIX versions of
Waffle v1.65, which is the latest release.  

DOS Waffle has an external command facility which lets it call other
mail and news readers seamlessly if they accept the user name on
their command line or from an environment variable.

Most ports of mail and news readers to the Waffle environment ignore
various parts of the above - which makes them clumsier to use than
their Waffle equivalents.

> We are looking at writing a driver for QWK format message stores.  

Since I'm more of a UNIX person, I don't know the QWK format.  Does
it bear any resemblance at all to MMDF, and does it use indexes?  My
guess would be no on both counts, but it doesn't hurt to ask...  ;-)

Following up on my previous message, quoting Mark Crispin:

Yes, the latest c-client has an MMDF driver, or rather a driver which
claims to support MMDF mailboxes.  Unfortunately, it is not presently
possible to use both the MMDF and Berkeley drivers in the same program
without designating one or the other as the INBOX driver.  I expect to
solve this problem in the future. 

What this means is that at present, the best way to have Pine support it
is to manually edit all reference to the bezerk driver to be to the mmdf
driver (that is, replacing one with the other).  Dynaming switching is
still in the future. 

Note that I only have the word of the submitter of the MMDF driver that it
works at all; we don't use MMDF here so I have no way of testing it.  I
have received a report that an assumption made by the driver (that MMDF

Sorry if this is a FAQ...

I have just build and installed imapd and ipopd on 3 HPs and a Sequent...

I love it...It's wonderful...HP performance is flawless...

The problem is on the Sequent...An S81 Symmetry running PTX 2.0.3...I have
problems logging in to the imap server on the sequent (from a Sun)...

I tried connecting directly to the IMAP socket (telnet storm 143) and
everything was fine...

Trying...
Connected to storm.cs.orst.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
* OK storm.cs.orst.edu IMAP2bis Service 7.3(63) at Wed, 18 Aug 1993
21:25:59 -0700 (PDT)

However, when I hit 'return'...I get...

Connection closed by foreign host.

When I do this on the HPs...

Trying...

What's happening on storm (the Sequent?)

Later...

Jason -

     Sorry for the problem.  The text below should be part of an FAQ:

     For those of you who have the dubious fortune of using PTX, there is an
additional little song and dance you have to do before building the servers in
the IMAP toolkit, due to a charming ``feature'' in PTX.  The inetd in PTX does
not do a complete job in setting up the file descriptors for a program that
runs under it.

     To work around this problem, somewhere in the beginning of imapd/imapd.c
(and in ipopd/ipop2d.c and ipopd/ipop3d.c if you use the POP servers), insert
these three lines:

  t_sync (0);
  ioctl (0,I_PUSH,"tirdwr");
  dup2 (0,1);

     At some point in the future, this will occur automatically without users
having to edit in this change.  Probably at the same time Sequent will change
PTX in a way that makes this workaround break things...

I'd like to give PINE access to some of my users that only have access to WYSE
50 terminals.  Unfortunately, the screen painting is not correct.

Is there a fix for this?  I'm using Pine 3.05 on SunOS 4.1.3.

Thanks.

Because of the change with Milton here on campus, I can't get off except
by listowner manually taking me off.

Can I rename the 2 'special' folders:
	saved-messages	->	saved
	sent-mail	->	sent
and still have then appear in the #2 and #3 positions on the folder list?

As I recall, the .pinerc file has a line for specifying the name of the
'sent-mail' folder:
	default-fcc=
but the .pinerc file does -not- allow specifying the name of the
'saved-messages' folder.  Could this be added?

WHY DO I WANT TO RENAME THESE FOLDERS ???  
Because (1) I move between these folders frequently, and (2) the long
names discourage me from using the "G" command.  So I use
"MF<arrows><enter>" instead.  Short names for these folders would allow me
to use the "G" command.  I also want the new name ('saved') to be the
default offered when I save messages ... UNLESS I have previously saved to
another folder, then I want that last-used folder name offered instead.

WHY DO I WANT THE FILES TO REMAIN IN THE #2 AND #3 POSITIONS ???
Because that's where they are most convenient (as you know).
Can you display the other special folders ON THE FIRST LINE of the folder
list also:
	postponed-message
	interrupted-message
	... (are there others?)

Mike,
  I think you'd get almost everything you want by just creating a link in your
folder directory:
   sent@ -> sent-mail

  As for the save to last folder used, you'll see that as a configuration
option in the next release, I believe.
  # saved-msg-name-rule= determines default folder name for Saves...
  # Choose one: default-folder, by-sender, by-recipient last-folder-used
  # Normal default is "default-folder"
  saved-msg-name-rule=

I believe this is fixed in 3.07. If not, there's another abort bug on 
SunOS that is fixed so it's worth getting.  Another problem I've seen 
with SunOS occurs with the GNU compiler. I believe you have to compile 
args.c and ttyin.c with the standard Sun compiler or you get aborts like 
these.

Didn't see a response to this. The answer is easy. Pine never overwrites 
and always appends.  Maybe that should be documented some where.

I don't suppose this could be included as an option in .pinerc or perhaps
have two export commands?  One for append and one for overwrite?

Laurence,

Thanks for the reply.  Does anyone else feel (as I do) that it would
sometimes be _useful_ to be able to overwrite an existing file with the
Export command, rather than append?  Do the Pine Developers like the
idea?? 

(Example: say you get mailed a new version of a particular file from time
to time: you want to export it overwriting the old version rather than
appending to it.)

Perhaps when the export file already exists, Pine, instead of asking
`overwrite y/n?', could ask `overwite/append/leave?', or something ?? 

   Thanks,

         I.

I would like to pose the opposing view.  An important feature of pine
is that it does not give so many choices that novice users (or even
experienced ones) have to make many choices.  This keeps support to
a minimum.  Each additional feature may seem logical, but they can
add up to something overloaded with bells and whistles.  

In this particular case, I agree that would be useful to be able to
overwrite a file on occasion.  Howver, I find it sufficiently easy to 
use the UNIX rm command or edit the extract file that I have a mild
preference to have pine simply and unconditionally append.

Now I _would_ prefer to have the option of specifying the path with ./filename
so that I could extract anywhere.  Since that would not alter the
standard behavior of the program and since it uses normal UNIX notation,
I would not see that in the same realm as adding another feature.

More views and opinions?

Just to voice strong agreement that cautious control of adding new
features is definitely a pine virtue.  I find Pine's current behaviour for
export is usually what is wanted.  A destructive overwrite would be unsafe
for novices, and experienced folks workaround it easily when necessary. 

Supporting paths relative to where pine starts with an explicit syntax
(like ./filename) would be handy.  I would rather have a means to do
environment variable substitution in pathnames (e.g. $FARAWAY/somefile) as
an old-growth option.

I agree with Michael on this one.

It can also be done from within pine.  Just move to the folders screen and
delete the folder.  Then go back to Index screen and save.

I think you can do this.  However, in your example the "." would refer to
the $HOME/mail directory (in our case anyway).  Specifying "../filename"
saves it in the $HOME directory for us (pine 3.07 for SunOS).

I also agree with everyone who voiced a fear of creeping 
feature-itis.  It would be great, though, if Pine had a 
few high level commands that power users could use to do
all kinds of things.  My requests:

1] Ability to pipe a message (when is this scheduled to
   be implemented?)

   In this export-and-overwrite example you could just do:

     | cat > filename


2] Ability to shell out while using Pine (any plans for this?)
   In this example you could first:

     !rm filename

   And then use the Pine Export.  (I prefer method 1 but the
   ability to shell out would be useful for other things.)


3] Macros (any plans for this?)
   Given that 1 and 2 are implemented, macros would give power
   Pine users all kinds of power.  


Thanks,
Nancy

We were talking about exporting to files, not saving to Pine
folders.

Whoops!  And can you believe that my biggest complaint to my students is

I also have times when I yearn for a shell escape.  But I quickly return
to my senses.  It is a real advantage to not have a shell escape from a
security standpoint.  Perhaps as a compile time option for those who
really don't care, but not as a configurable option please.

If I save something from mail I don't find it an intolerable burden to
give the file a new name and do some rm and mv stuff after I exit to put
the file where I want it instead of overwriting the file.  The way I look
at it, I'm much more able to do that and I want a simple mail user agent
for most of the people who use pine.

Yeah, I've longed for a shell escape, but a ctrl-z usually does it for me.  
I wish that pine could automatically enter another editor (like vi) instead of
pico.  But that would kind of destroy the whole ease of use thing.  

All these comments could possibly go in a feature list like old-growth, or the

I fully agree with the concept of keeping Pine as simple as possible. Of
course, we all have our own idea of "simple." :-)

I have had several users ask me if Pine or Pico has a command to move you
to either the top or bottom of a message.  A useful command for people who
manipulate long messages.

Could this be already present, but undocumented?

I couldn't agree more what Dan said.  Most of the people just want a
simple mail user agent, and they don't care or don't even want to know
what unix commands are.  My users keep telling me that the Pine is the
best mail agent they ever had.  And I hope it will be the best forever.

Thanx jim....but the optimal word is **automatically** enter another
editor.  I wish that it would just dump me into vi from the start, instead 
of having to do ^_ (which in some cases doesn't work....but that's another 
story....)  Like i said, it's just wishful thinking for a more configurable
pine.....nothing more.

PINE can use another editor, use the following line in your .pinerc

# Editor to use in place of Pine's internal composer, Pico
editor=vi

Agreed! If you specify an alternative editor (in the individual 
users .pinerc), surely it should dump you immediately into your choice.

As for the current dicussion on feature 'explosion' within pine, I would
have thought that the seedling/sapling/old-growth options would be the 
perfect wide to 'hide' complex features.

If you are a seedling, all you see is a very simple interface (which pine
is all about), up to old-growth where you should be able to make 
considerable short-cuts and configuration.

I think the big problem in doing stuff like this is key bindings. There 
just aren't enough letters in the alphabet to keep it simple and 
uncluttered. 

A cute trick to get to the top of a message, especially for slow lines, 
is to go to the previous message and then the next (which is of course 
what you were just reading).  That's only two full screen repaints 
instead of however many screenfuls to scroll back to the top.

Given you can ^Z, you are probably running a shell with aliasing 
capabilities (e.g., csh, tcsh...).  Rather than changing pine, why not:
	alias p 'pine -iz'
Or something like that.  (I like the '-i' option at all times.)

Actually, it should have been

Several folks have requested that Pine support a "Reply-to" header.
This is definitely on the list and will probably make it into Pine 4.0.
However, in some cases it seems to me that the problem people are trying 
to solve can be addressed already via the "user-domain" variable in the 
.pinerc...

This variable, if set, specifies what will be on the right side of the "@"
sign in the "From: " field of outgoing messages (among other things).  For
example, if you receive some of your mail at "joe@blah.cs.washington.edu" but
you want people to send to a generic address such as "joe@u.washington.edu"
this can be done by setting "user-domain=u.washington.edu".

In PC-Pine you can also set the left side of the @ in the From: field via 
the userid variable.  But on Unix Pine, the account names on the machine 
where mail is delivered and the machine where you run Pine must match.
(That limitation is why a reply-to would be handy in some cases.)

My instant recommendation on such matters is to fix the problem at the
sendmail end and not at the user agent end, and use IDA sendmail. 
Although IDA is not intuative to install, once it is and you understand
its "language" it is a very nice and easy system for doing the above.  For
example, a user named joe at a machine called blah.cs.washington.edu can
have his header *AND* his envolope "From" address mapped to say
Joe.Trumpet@u.washington.edu.

This doesn't address the problem I have here.  I use several
different logins on my systems here and would like e-mail replies
to come back to a single login.  Reply-To: handles this very
nicely.  This is the job of the MUA (Mail User Agent), not the
MTA (Mail Transport Agent).  Typically it requires action by the
system administrator to do things in the MTA while the users can
do the MUA stuff themselves.

I know Pine is not Elm, but the ~/.elm/elmheaders file is a very
simple solution which would be trivial to implement in Pine.

The environment you work in certainly can make a difference. IDA can do
what you want and more.  It can set the same return address for different
users on not only the same machine but different ones on your local area
network or domain.  It all depends on how easy it is to get the system
manager to keep changing the settings.  That's all.  By all means let pine
do some of the work that IDA can do but just keep in mind that other
solutions do already exist.

I also need a "User Guide" rather than the tech-notes for the many less
knowledgeable computer users.

Will the new version of pine run on a DEC (ALPHA) OSF/1 V1.2 Worksystem
Software (Rev. 10)?

If not, has anyone on the net ported pine 3.07 to the alpha machines?

Yes, Pine 3.85 will include a port for DEC ALPHA OSF/1 V1.2.  We don't 
use ALPHA's in a production environment here so it has not been tested 
all that thoroughly, but it will be in there.

Has anyone tried taking an Ultrix compiled pine and using mx on it 
to make an alpha osf/1 version?

Well, I suppose it might work, but why not just wait a couple weeks for

Subject: Additional feature for novices

I'm very much in sympathy with the "keep it simple" philosophy of Pine;
adding lots of power options is probably going to benefit relatively few
users who could usually get those features elsewhere anyway.

Having said that, I'd like to suggest a feature that would benefit novice
users and system administrators alike. You know the "Move sent-mail to
sent-mail-aug93?" feature? Could I suggest that "Move inbox to inbox-aug93"
would be much more beneficial?

Several correspondents have sought tools for managing overlarge mailboxes
in the mail spool. The problem is usually caused by novices who don't
appreciate that subscribing to lots of lists (and forgetting how to use
"unsubscribe"), mailing themselves binaries from gopher servers, or simlply
keeping al their mail together rather than filing it in folders has an
impact on other users (or the whole system). 

The trouble with the tools available is _by_definition_ the users who need
them can't use them - and these same users are Pine's target group. At the
moment our sysadmins find oversize mailboxes, move them to home directories
and compress them. The mail is recoverable by users of course, but the
prime offenders/victims tend to be pretty traumatised by this.

I think that Pine should offer something  here and adding (or even
substituting) the feature above would help a great deal. The existing
feature is nice but only renames a file in the user's mail folder - it has
no general benefit.

Mike

hi : we have observed that "pine" will not move a message from a generic
folder to the "inbox" folder. when we attempt this, pine says the "message
is saved and marked for deletion" but the message never shows up in "inbox".

can anyone on the list comment on this. (we are currently running pine 3.05)

I would like to suggest that in some future release a mechanism be in
place that allows mail bounced for bad address (user unknown, host
unknown) to be resent with the corrected information.  Many times it is a
fat fingered typo and up to now I tell the users to save the message as a
file edit off the mail stuff and then read the file into a new pine session.
Or perhaps, someone has a better idea?  I am open to suggestions to a
better way

What I do in these cases is forward the message to the new address and
edit it on-screen to get rid of the bounce information I don't want.  I
don't see why saving it in an intermediate file would be easier or better.

I use the F[orward] command; then use the pine composer to ^K
[delete-line] and ^U [undelete-line] and ^D [delete-character];
thus moving the address up into the header, and removing all the
error messages; then send the reconstituted message on its way.

I just forward it to the correct address and hack out all the
unnecessaries, like the old mail stuff, right there (as well as the (fwd)
in the header...)

Later...

I like the system in which the inbox only contains new and/or unread mail
- mail which has been read moves to mbox in the users home/mail directory
as previous mail.

NO! Please no. While I admit for administrative purposes this makes sense,
it does not fit into Pine. Users are used to the "pile of mail"
approach...both expert and novice. They like working from a central store
and pruning.

Also, having been a victim of NeXTMail that already does this, it creates
nightmares for working in a distributed environment. If you are used to
IMAP clients, moving from one computer to another, or even shared mail
between accouts this is the worst thing possible. You end up with the old
POP dilema of messages and mail on twenty computers all over the place. One of
the features of PINE I love is the use of the Post Office as inbox rather
than displacing mail.

Is there any interest in showing the folder name on printed messages?

Pruning - now that really does make your mail inaccessible! If you get mail
you have to manage it. Pine does it with sent-mail .. (pity it is the 1st
question new users get asked).
I quite often get told by users that mail has been lost (mail they have
read) - but they have deleted it, because that is what pine encourages.

I don't know the technical problems but I think IMAP should manage mail
folders not just the inbox. I am just as likely to want access to the
mail message I sent in reply as the previous mail message I received.
