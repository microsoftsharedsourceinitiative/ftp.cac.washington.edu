Hello,
   This sounds like a simple problem of there not being a termcap (or 
terminfo) entry for tvi925's. 

Unfortunately, knowing a tvi925's once having had one on my desk, there's 
another problem in that the require a space on the screen to change video 
attributes (reverse video) and Pine doesn't work with these terminals in 
the normal node.  The screen painting gets all scrambled.  The Pine 
Tech Notes have a solution for this and includes a termcap entry that 
should work. 

There's also the problem that the arrow keys on these terminals don't 
work because the send control key sequences that Pine uses for some of 
it's commands.  There's no real work around for these.

I believe most of these problems occur with Wyse60's too.

Hello --

I'm trying to provide a small school with a simple mail+news installation;
the system available is 80386 Xenix 2.3.2.  I have an incomplete PICO port
working, but there seem to be some more fundamental problems with PINE.
As I'm doing this as a volunteer, I don't have much time to put into solving
them.  I'd appreciate any contact information regarding ports of PINE to
Xenix, SCO UNIX, 386/ix, or any other 386 System V environment.

I'd appreciate reply by mail -- I'm not a subscriber to this list.
Please reply to the address below, not the origination address of this
note.  Thanks!

Yes.  There are unsubstantiated rumors of a project somewhere to port 
Pine to VMS, but it was only a third-hand report...

I have made great progress in building an OSF/Motif-based Graphical User 
Interface for pine. I can already browse the folder index, select and
manipulate folders and collections, and view messages. Compose, 
addressbook, configuration and help screens still need to be implemented. 
Plus a lot of polishing.

Basically what I have done, is that I've thrown out all the code that
does I/O onto screen (calls to ttyin.c and ttyout.c). I have built
respective Motif screens with an interface builder, rewritten the code
that builds and maintains lists etc on tty-screen, to fill instead
Motif list and text widgets. User interaction now comes through callbacks
from Motif widgets (Menus, buttons and lists) for which I have to write 
callback functions to execute pine functions.

The GUI interface code will be plain automatically generated K&R C, which 
should compile on any Unix machine, which has X11R5 and Motif 1.2 libraries 
installed. The underlying remaining pine code will remain essentially 
unchainged, so that should compile on the same Unix platforms as 3.89 did. 
A lot of original pine code can be thrown away since Motif widgets handle 
most screen operations by themselves (such as scrolling lists and texts), 
and pico will no longer be needed at all.

This is what it will look like:
- The main window will pop-up first, it contains the folder index list,
  which looks pretty much the same what the L-command in pine shows. It is 
  scrollable and has scrollbars, a popup-menu etc. 
  Above the list is a status bar, exactly like in pine.
  Above status bar is a menu bar, containing pulldown menus, from which 
  most Pine functions can be executed. 
  Below the folder index list is a pane of push buttons, which allows 
  convinient execution of the most common functions.
  Below that is a scrollable text window, onto which all messages to user are 
  printed.

- A separate window is provided for viewing messages. This allows concurrent
  viewing of the folder index and messages. Messages are shown in a scrollable 
  text widget. This window also has a menu bar and push buttons.

- Yet another window is provided for composing messages. The editor is very 
  simple typical Motif text widget application. it does however provide
  pull-down menus and pop-up dialogs etc. Another more powerfull editor can
  be used instead, like in pine.
  
- Addressbook is shown in yet another dialog window, which has one list for
  individual addresses, one for mailing lists and a third to show contents
  of mailing list items. Plus text fields for editing and adding entries
  and command buttons and menus.

- Collections and folders are selected also with a custom dialog having
  scrollable lists and nescessary buttons etc.

- Options and user preferences can be set from a separate window. This
  will eliminate the need to edit .pinerc by hand. .signature can be
  edited too. .forward and vacation can be turned on/off from menus.

- Of course there will be also a help text viewer (and help button on each
  window and dialog), with a help item index, 
  possibly with mouse pointable context sensitive help and maybe even
  hypertext links.

- Attachement viewers for GIF's, Postscript etc. can be integrated more
  smoothly now. 

As this is just a hobby for me, it will take probably until March before 
I get a distributable version of the package together. It will run on
HP9000/73x's (HP-UX 9.01) for sure, maybe even on IBM RS/6000's (AIX 3.2). 
As the unix system-call dependencies are pretty well isolated into one 
module in pine already (os-???.c), there will probably be very few problems 
in porting the code to any reasonable Unix-platform (with Motif).
Needeless to say, this won't work on DOS. As a matter of fact, I've
thrown that code out as it makes reading very difficult.

I've had exactly the same problem on HP-UX after upgrading to PINE 3.88 from 
3.07. The message went away after the users saved/deleted their old mail 
messages from INBOX. It seems there is a different date field handling in
PINE >= 3.87.
Hope this might help.

Greetings,
-Rainer.

Subject: IMAP/POP client for Windows?

PINE is great for sure but --- our users demand Windows program.
So can anyone of you recommend a free or shareware email program
for Windows that uses IMAP, POP and or SMTP?  Preferably MIME compliant
but they can live without that.

** Please reply directly to me via email as it's a little outside the
   subject for this mailing list

(While waiting for a PINE that can be used to read/reply mail off-line
 I have to use this NuPOP program which is pretty good but doesn't do
 MIME at all which is quite unfortunate as the users at work that send
 me mail uses PINE now. And as we speak ISO 8859-1 they use a lot of
 8bit chars which are then quoted...)

Christer,

I have gotten PC-Pine to run as a DOS application from within MS-Windows
using a PIF file that gives PC-Pine some background CPU cycles for IMAP
on 386 and 486 CPUs.  It involves running a package called PKTMUX after
the Ethernet packet driver is started and before MS-Windows is started.

If PC-Pine is positioned in a window "just right" you can see the status
line highlighted when new mail arrives.  

If you want further details.  Please let me know.

Christer,
I'm aware of two MS Windows IMAP clients that support MIME, both of them 
commercial:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Client         MIME?   Source/Vendor   Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ECSMail 2.2     Yes    ISA Corp.       Released <ecs-sales@edm.isac.ca>
  PC-MM           Yes    ICL ProSystems  Released <Lars_Hagberg@li.icl.se>

The second one (from Sweden) I just learned about today...

-teg

p.s. I CC'd the list because I think your question is actually on the
minds of many friends of Pine... For a more complete listing of
IMAP-capable mailers, see the file mail/imap.software on
ftp.cac.washington.edu, from which the above info is taken.

Eudora for the PC is a windows application and works just like the Mac 
version. It supports both pop and mime and is free. You can find Eudora

I have UNIX PINE compiled and installed on a variety of machine flavours
here and PC-PINE has been very successful. 

For consistency's sake I would like to install PC-PINE on a windows PC 
running a SLIP dialup to a NON-IMAP mail feeder.

Has anybody modified PC-PINE to pick up mail off a local .txt mailbox 
and send mail to the normal .txt and .wrk files?

Thanks, 
Martin

anyone has compile pine on PTX?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in

Lisa,

The "ptx" port of Pine runs fine on most Dynix/ptx systems.  The only 
ones that have much trouble are running old versions of PTX, which I 
presume you will not be doing...

Yup...We have 2 Sequent S81's running Dynix/PTX 2.0.3...Pine is the 
easiest app to compile on a Sequent I've seen yet...The Pine folks have 
done a wonderful job implementing the PTX platform...Way to go, guys!

I'm running pine on Interactive 4.0 (SunSoft), which is System V Release
3.2. The patches and additional files required for this port have not yet
been added to the distribution.

We are moving toward getting our users to use the Pine mail program 
instead of Elm, but a few people recall a couple problems with Pine in 
the past, and I wonder if these problems have since been resolved.

Is there a limit to the number of addresses you can place in a group 
alias?

Is there a way to tell pine to go out and check if there is new mail in 
the current folder you are working with?

When I am attempting to debug something, and I know I have new mail
waiting, I'd like to be able to tell it to check for new mail right now.

None that I am aware of, but I'm not sure.

Pressing 'N' five times or so when at the last message in that folder 
will cause pine to then check that folder for new mail.  You can be 
either at the INDEX or actually reading the last message in the folder.

No, there is no design limit to the number of addresses in a distribution
list.  Older versions of Pine did have bugs or triggered bugs in sendmail to
effectively limit the size, but they have all been fixed in Pine 3.89, as far
as we know. 

There are two ways to force a mail check.  1) go to the bottom of the 
index and press 'N' a few times.  2) Refresh the screen with '^L'.

I've tried this on Pine v3.88 and while the hitting the 'N' key a few 
times seems to work, when I refresh the screen with '^L' it doesnt seem 
to do a mail check,  I did this from the index screen.

I used to have scripts in ELM that I used to automatically sign or verfy 
mail with PGP.  Is there any way to accomplish this with Pine?  Or is 
anyone working on including any form of encyption/digital signatures with 
Pine?

It is pretty simple to set up pine to sign a message.

The first step is to write a simple script.  I call this script 'picopgp'

--->  Begin
	#!/bin/sh

	pico -z -t $1
	pgp -sat $1
	mv $1.asc $1
--->  End

Next, set your alternate editor to this script file.

Then, whenever you invoke your alternate editor, it will launch pico 
again, but when you finish, it will sign your mailing.

------

To decrypt stuff, you will have to wait for the pipe command to be 
implemented (unless it was in 3.89, we have 3.88).  To encrypt on the 
fly, I'm afraid that I don't know of a way.

Hope this helps.

Has anyone attempted to get any other forms of encryption working with 
Pine, like RIPEM?  I think the security of one's mail is becoming 
increasingly important as the net grows, and being able to sign my 
messages is nice, but I think we need to find a way to encrypt/decrypt on 
the fly.

I agree, I think it is important.  But there are some very serious legal 
issues that surround cryptography.  Not only are there export controls, 
but PGP has some legal problems with the RSA patent.  There's also the 
problem of determining which crytographic method will become the standard 
(I like PGP, myself).

Hope the signing script helps.

We're planning on rolling out the 3.89 Pine in February to our hospital 
users, but are leery of the network traffic as people experiment with the 
Update option from the Setup menu. Is there any way to disable this? 

Thanks.

Argh.  I got Pine 3.88 all set up an then I find that 3.89 has the one 
feature my boss requested.  :)

Are there any other feature changes from 3.88 to 3.89, and when is the 
next version due out?  I might just wait and set up the next version 
instead.

No, everthing else was a bug fix.  (I'll append a list of the main ones 
from the release notes.)

It will probably generate less traffic than my responding
to this message.  I'd suggest not to worry about it.

I agree with you that you should be able to disable it, either
dynamically or statically (at compile-time).

For Pine 3.87 (if I'm right) I made a patch to introduce a macro
DISABLE_UPDATE.  Compiling Pine with -DDISABLE_UPDATE then does
what it says: disabling the update option (and the option has
also disappeared from the menu).

If people are interested I can mail it (but remember, it is for
3.87 and it may require some porting).

That may be true of the programs themselves, but surely not a
framework within pine that allows one to transparently run such
programs?

Is there a User's Guide for pine (other than the Pine Technical Notes)? 
Have other sites created their own documentation?  Any help is
appreciated.

Isn't it about time that the State Department or whoever it is recognised 
the stupidity of the export controls, which are unnecessary, 
and unenforceable anyway? Has there been any interest or progress in 
removing that obstacle?

Subject: Confused users -- moving of read messages

At my SunOS 4.1.3 site, we want to move read messages from file
/usr/spool/mail/$USER to file $HOME/mail/mailbox. To do this, the
users file .pinerc holds
	read-message-folder=3Dmailbox

This works, but the messages and prompts in connection with this
confuses users. After having read a message (which was in folder
"INBOX", ie file /usr/spool/mail/$USER), and quiting Pine, the user is
asked whether to save the read messages to folder "mailbox". The user
answers "y" and the messages are copied. Next, Pine asks the user
whether the user wants to expunge the DELETED messages from folder
"INBOX".

This is what confuses the users. "What? I haven't deleted any
messages!".

Wouldn't it be better if the operation was -- instead of "save and
delete" -- presented as a "move" with an implicit delete and expunge
of the moved messages?

As an alternative, it might be better to ask the user first about the
save, then about a deletion of the saved messages and last about an
expunge of the deleted messages.

And no, setting
	feature-list=3Dauto-move-read-msgs

doesn't help, as this only controls whether the user is asked about
the save of the messages to folder "mailbox", not whether the user is
asked about the expunge.

	/Klaus

PS As a warning, don't try putting
	read-message-folder=3Dinbox

in the .pinerc file as the folder menu treats both "inbox" and "INBOX"
as aliases for the file /usr/spool/mail/$USER -- even if the file
$HOME/mail/inbox exists. On the other hand, SAVING to folder "inbox",
copies the message to the file $HOME/mail/inbox. As you understand,
the result is a bunch of users who can't find their previous read
messages, thinking their messages are lost ...

You could also create a mail.TxT file in their home directory, this
will suck the mail out of spool into their home, but to the user
it will all be a part of the "INBOX".

Is is possible to use LPT2 or LPT3 with PC-Pine 3.89?  The reason I 
ask is that we have a number of network print queues available on each 
machine, and LPT1 is not always a text queue (ie. on some machines
LPT1 is connected to a postscript only, or a local postacript printer).

Thanx

We have a set of Course Notes, recently updated to be applicable to 
version 3.8* of Pine. The document has been produced using Interleaf, and
contains screen displays (but these are text, not screen dumps). I can 
supply a hard copy, a PostScript file, the Interleaf file, an rtf version
(produced by Interleaf, readable by Word), and a plain text version to
anyone who wants one.

The files are available via ftp to deneb.dur.ac.uk, in the directory
pub/Documents/Pine. The Interleaf files are in a subdirectory of Pine, called
Interleaf.

I've also done a small mod to the code suggested by the Pine team that 
does basically the same thing but uses ~/mbox.  I think the mail.TxT is a 
different mailbox format, isnt it?

This is long overdue; sorry...

(For those new to this list: "Y Print" is not viewed as one of our very
best user-interface design decisions because "Y" is also a frequent
response to Pine's (y/n) prompts, so last month we asked for feedback on 
which of several alternatives we should pursue...)

I have reviewed all of the responses to the survey on what to do about the
"Y" key.  Eliminating any votes from the Pine team, here are the results: 

1. "Do nothing" got 13 first choice responses, including two that indicated 
   they were based on a survey of their users.  (One said all 149 of his 
   users preferred no change, but he personally would prefer to change.)

2. "Use K" got 3 first choice responses.

3. "Use %"  got 8 first choice responses, including one that said "if a
   change is needed, I prefer %", so this one might actually be a vote for
   no change. 

4. "Make it an option" got 0 first choice responses.  

Plus there were two impassioned pleas to go back to using L for print, one
suggestion to make everything configurable, one to go to two-character
commands (which we have in some cases via subcommands) and one request to
do a thorough review and one massive change to make everything more
consistent --which is of course what we thought we were doing this past
spring :(

So the status quo appears to be the outcome preferred by a clear majority
as far as I can tell.  That result was consistent with the feedback we got
from our own UW support folks.  Accordingly, we will continue to use Y for
Print.  However, as suggested in several messages to the list, we will
change the nomenclature from "Y Print" to "Y prYnt" to emphasize the
relationship.

Correct, mail.TxT is Tenex format which is not compatible with other mail 
tools (including text editors ;)  However, it can be a very big win if 
you have a memory-constrained system.

A suggestion to the Pine Team:

We've just uncovered an uncomfortable trap. A user who had been using 
PC-Pine logged onto our Unix system and wanted to use Pine there. He 
naturally copied his pinerc file from the PC to the Unix system. The 
problem was, it contained

smtp-server=<something>

which caused behaviour that we don't want; we want all mail sent on the 
Unix system to go through sendmail (= smail, actually). Would it be 
possible to have an option in the system pinerc that said "don't take any 
notice of smtp-server settings in users' pinerc files"?

In fact, we'd appreciate a more general facility whereby we could give a
list of options that users were not allowed to change. (Have I suggested
this before?) As well as a general Unix system, we also have a "mail-only" 
system, and currently have to hack Pine on that system to prevent users
escaping via the alternate editor and printer configuration options. 

Regards,
Philip

Philip Hazel's suggestion to make certain configurable fields only 
configurable at the system-wide level sounds *great* to me -- it would 
cut down on user questions here as people often get themselves into 
trouble messing around with their PC-PINE configuration (and, to a lesser 
extent, UNIX .pinerc).

I reported these two bugs to pine-bugs today. I wonder if other people 
have experienced them, and if the collective wisdom of the group might 
shed some light on the circumstances?

Both symptoms have occurred also with earlier releases of PINE.

1. Lost data in messages copied to folders. 

I only see this very rarely, and when it happens it seems that the body 
of the message (everything except the Berkeley header) vanishes.

This shows in the index as a line with blank data, and an empty message 
(no header or anything) when trying to read the data. Whenever I have 
spotted this quickly enough, I know that there was once genuine data, and 
it has certainly genuinely disappeared (so it is not a phantom header 
effect). 

My most recent case I detected today, but seems to have occurred on Dec 
15 (the gap is between two messages on that day). I installed 3.89 on Dec 
8 (so the effect must be in 3.89).

2. "Blob"s
Files whose name is "blob" (the non ascii character which looks like a 
square) appear in directories. This appears to happen quite reliably in 
some circumstances, and not at all in others.

Thes effect seems to be highly environmentally dependent; the member of my
staff who tripped over it, can trigger it from any seat on our Novell Net,
and from his desktop (which remote boots from the Net), but not from my
desktop PC, which is locally booted. Conversely, if I move to the Network,
I can provoke the effect, but I cannot while I stay using my desktop
machine! 

I have so far not been able to isolate what feature of the environment is 
the one that differs critically in the two cases.

The circumstances reported that cause a failure (when conditions are 
right!) are:
-------------------------
Running pine from outside the root directory, opening a folder and 
quitting creates a blob. This blob is of various sizes, the smallest 
being 4096.

Hi all,

Has anyone, or is anyone, worked (working) on a c-client.dll over winsock 
for MS windows (or workgroups).

If not it seems as if I will start spending a month of sundays taking the 
dos pc-pine ports and trying to shoehorn them into a dll.

Thanks

Hi everyone:

I got one problem.  If the system is IBM ES9000/ Model 480 running AIX 
2.2, what kind of unix-binaries I should use or what I should do to run 
pine on this system?

Thanks for any suggestion!

I sent this message to pine-bugs but I'm told pine-info is a good place 
to send to as others may have simialr experience/workarounds/whatever
==============================================================================
We are trying to set up PC Pine to be compatible with the Unix hosted 
version already in wide use at this site. 

PINE's use of IMAP thus using the same mailboxes by the PC and Unix hosts
does of course make the two flavours broadly compatible, and as users here
usually mount their home directories with PC-NFS I have been investigating
to what extent the .signature and .addressbook files can be kept in common
between versions. 

I find that both PC (v3.89) and Unix (v3.88) PINE are happy with either
DOS or Unix format .signature files, so provided that the names specified
in the .pinerc and PINERC files are compatible (i.e. Unix filenames map
into DOS filenames without being mangled by PCNFS) then this file can be
common to both types of PINE. 

I find that likewise both flavours of PINE are happy with either format of
address book file, and again provided the names are compatible this would
seem to allow this file to be shared between versions:  unfortunately
however when editing the address book file the DOS version of PINE gives 
an error: 

	Error updating address book: Cross-device link

- and on exit from PINE, the file has been deleted! Oddly this only seems
to happen when the address book file is in the 'root' directory of the
NFS-mounted drive (whether this is the user's home directory or not): if
the file is in a subdirectory of the NFS-mounted drive, or the root 
directory of a real disk or of a SUBSTed drive it is OK. 

PC-NFS version is 5.00, and the filesystems tried have been an Auspex
fileserver and a Sun SPARCStation IPX. Possibly the problem is with
PC-NFS, hence the copy to the CHEST-PCNFS list - has anyone seen similar
funnies with PC-NFS-mounted files?

Henry,

We do not supply pre-compiled binaries for AIX, except on the RS/6000. 
You should get the source distribution (mail/pine.tar.Z on
ftp.cac.washington.edu) and build the "aix" version.  Note that we no
longer actively support this port, so we cannot guarantee it's quality. 

I hope that helps!

Ross,
We had actually hoped that all the *shoehorning* was done to create the
*DOS* port, and moving to a DLL would be *easy* by comparison :)

Seriously, porting not just c-client, but all of Pine, to a
Winsock/Windows* environment is a very important project to us, but we
haven't had any resources to commit just yet.  That could change soon, 
however.  If you think it makes any sense to try to collaborate, let's 
discuss by separate email.

-teg

* Initially we intend to port the existing character-based Pine to Windows
without changing the interface to a GUI.  After that, we'll look at whether
it makes sense to embark on a "WinPine" GUI version...

I should have been a bit more clear about the status of the AIX ports.  

We *do* actively support Pine running under AIX 3.2 on the IBM RS/6000
platform.  This is the "a32" port of pine and corresponds to the
pine-bin.aix32 and pico-bin.aix32 pre-compiled binaries in the
mail/UNIX-BINARIES directory on ftp.cac.washington.edu. 

We no longer have access to AIX on our IBM 9000 and thus cannot provide
direct support for that platform.  This is the "aix" port of pine.  We
will continue to distribute the "aix" port and incorporate patches from
outside contributors on a best-effort basis. 

I am sorry about any confusion/panic this might have caused!

A professor here is attempting to print out her mail on her local 
printer without success.  Pine apparently ships off the message and 
indicates that the message has been printed, but with no results.

She is trying this from a Mac running Kermit to a HP Deskwriter C.  Pine 
is version 3.88.  Does attached to ansi function properly with Kermit and 
this printer?

Well, I just recently downloaded it, and its quality seems to be excellent.

I saw Pine in action at the University of Vermont, where they just put
everyone on the net.  Helping a friend use it who only had Macintosh
experience convinced me that this was an excellent mail system, one
I could teach without ever having seen it before, and one he could use
knowing very little.

I'd like to give our users here the option to use Pine.

Now for *my* questions.

I'm new to this list, so if there's an FAQ that answers these questions,
just refer me to it.  We use mostly Elm here, and are looking into Pine
because it's seems easier to learn to use, and because the header editor
is incorporated into the message editor.  But I have Elm prejudices:

     1. When my .signature is included, how do I get the standard `-- '
	placed above it (or do I have to place this in my .signature file?

     2. I'd like included text (from replies, or for forwards) to be
	prefixed with a fixed string (like `> ').  Can I do this in pine,
	I've read the FM, and I don't see a configuration option for it.

     3. In .pinerc, when inbox-path is left empty, pine doesn't look at
	the MAIL environment variable for the mailbox; it always assumes
	it is in /usr/spool/mail (or /usr/mail, presumably).  I can
	easily override this with `inbox-path=$MAIL', so it's not a big
	deal, it just surprised me.

     4. The remarks about being able to get around being prompted for
	username and password each time you connect to an imapd imply
	that it can be made to use the rsh authentication.  It's not
	too clear on how to set this up (just make a link to rimapd,
	but don't I need to put rimapd in /etc/inetd.conf instead of
	imapd?).  In any case, it doesn't seem to work here.  At first
	I thought it was maybe because I don't have a .rhosts (we use
	hosts.equiv), but creating one didn't help.

     5. As a note to concurrent Elm users -- Pine rewrites your mailbox,
	adding X-Status: headers to old messages.  If you are in Elm and
	Pine simultaneously, Elm will think the mailbox is corrupt the next
	time it looks at it after Pine changes it.  I understand why Pine
	does this, and Elm (2.3PL11) wasn't written to allow concurrent
	mailbox changes.
    
     6. In Pico, is there any key sequence that will get me to the beginning
	or end of the document?  Or a way to prefix numbers to commands
	so I don't have to hit ^V a dozen times?  Am I being too picky?

Pico is a *great* editor for first time users.  The built-in help, auto

Correct.  The default location is set in the OS-dependent includes to be 
the "usual location" for a particular OS.  This can be overridden per 
system in the /usr/local/lib/pine.conf file.  The objective is to reduce 
surprise for novice users who probably do not know about the MAIL 
variable.

If you make an rsh connection, you are not going through inetd and 
therefore do not need an entry in inetd.conf for rimapd.  To test rimapd, 
just execute "rsh host /etc/rimapd".  You should get something like

To exit rimapd, use "* logout"

Therefore, if I have pine-bin.aix32, where and how can I get the 
incorporate patches of IBM ES9000 Model 480 running AIX 2.2?

And for PC-PINE can we have the ESCAPE key do the same as ^C, as that's a 
common DOSsy way of doing things?

Dear Sirs,

I have recently started to use Pine 3.89 and am having problems using
the mark text command "^^". This us used by our network switch to suspend 
a given work session and put the user back to the switch.  Is there some 
other command which can also be used to mark text or is it possible to 
redefine this command??

Regards
Eddie

If you are using a Cisco terminal server, just press ^^ twice in a row.
If you are using a 3COM or Data General terminal server, you can redefine
the "ECMC" character to something else. For example: set privilige
level to global and then redefine for each port with a terminal on it.

> set pri=g
Password: whatever
> setd (!1) ecmc=^\

Note ... type out the chars ^ and \ above, don't use CTRL-\

If you are just a "common" user on a 3COM term server, log in, then
first time you press ^^ and go to the term server prompt, enter the
command "set ecmc=^\" and then "resume" and you are back into business.

Actually, this is subject to the "quit-without-confirm" option, so I 
presume you have this set (possibly because you have "old-growth"). 
Without that option you get asked "do you really want to leave pine y/n".

Further to me previous postings about this: I said both (PC and Unix) 
versions of Pine seem happy with either DOS or Unix format for address 
book and signature files. 

However I have seen today a funny with the Unix version of Pine (v3.88)
with a DOS format address book file: the first column (nicknames) displays
only parts of some entries, until the cursor has run over the entry, and 
then it gets filled in. Once the entry has paged off the screen and back 
on it has gaps again. E.g.:

  ed                Bloggs, Fred                f.bloggs
a   ur              Daley, Arthur               a.daley@lockup.peckham
g d                 Deity, The                  s.being@heaven

and after the cursor has been down the page:

fred                Bloggs, Fred                f.bloggs
arthur              Daley, Arthur               a.daley@lockup.peckham
god                 Deity, The                  s.being@heaven

etc - get the idea?

With the DOS version of Pine reading a Unix format file everything is OK.

I also noted that the Unix Pine doesn't change the format of the address 
book file when it edits it, but the DOS version re-writes a Unix format 
file in DOS format when any changes are made.

When trying to use PC pine to access a mailbox on a machine that probably 
doesn't have the IMAP daemon running (I thought it did!) Pine bombed out 
with an error:

run-time error R6000
- stack overflow

and when I started it up again it complained that it could not find a 
packet driver (and TRYPKTD - which comes with NuPOP - agreed).

PC PINE V3.89

Does this mean that it is somewhat clever (i.e. it checks to see if an update is
necessary before doing it)?

I was wrong about another aspect of the compatability between Unix and PC 
versions: mailboxes - other than INBOX - do not seem to be readable by Unix 
pine 3.88 when they have been written by PC Pine 3.89.

This is of course a case where the PC-written mailboxes are in DOS file 
format, and Unix Pine (presumably) expects Unix file format.

<sigh>

Maybe I've got the wrong end of the stick here?

I assumed that the point of PC-PINE using IMAP was to allow it to
manipulate the same mailboxes that the native Unix Pine does, and so 
allow users to switch seamlessly between one implementation and another. 
The more-or-less compatability between the two versions in reading 
signature and address book files strengthened my assumption that this was 
one of the design criteria of PINE.

In an academic environment this holds out the promise that the user can
normally use the PC based version, but when away from base can log in over
the network and use the Unix hosted version and still have the same
environment, including access to their mail folders, address book etc.
This seems like a very important potential benefit, and a reason for
choosing Pine rather than NuPOP, Eudora, PC-ELM, Lifeline or whatever. 

Am I wrong about the design philosophy, or is it just buggy? Or is it the
difference in versions? Unfortunately I'm not sysadmin of the unix box so
I can't up the Unix version to match the DOS one. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking PINE, I like it: it's straightforward
to use and fairly easy to set up - not what I'd say about the others. (And
I _love_ the postpone composition feature!) I'd just like to know what
it's _supposed_ to do, and have it do it! 

:-)

BTW, this is all with the packet-driver version of PC Pine. I tried the 
PCNFS version and it didn't run (I forget why - I think it said it 
couldn't find its IMAP server). It didn't have any documentation on how 
to set up the PCNFS version, and the Packet Driver version worked so I've 
stuck with it. Can anyone tell me how to get the PCNFS ver. working?

If you are using IMAP from PC Pine and not the local DOS filesystem, then PC
Pine and UNIX Pine are completely compatible.

If you are using the local DOS filesystem to store mailboxes from PC Pine, the
file formats have two differences.  One difference is in newline convention;
the other is in the representation of timezones.

UNIX Pine 3.90 will be capable of reading the mailboxes written by PC Pine on
the local DOS filesystem, with the addition of a new UNIX MTX driver that
parallels the local file driver on DOS.

PC Pine will also be able to read Unix Pine mailboxes in ``MTX'' format (but
not other UNIX Pine format mailboxes -- Unix Pine presently is capable of
supporting nearly 1/2 dozen different formats of mail.  DOS lacks the address
space to have such extensive support).

We do not, however, recommend using PC Pine to read mailboxes that reside on a
UNIX server through filesystem operations (e.g. through NFS or Novell) instead
of IMAP.  This is because UNIX-based mailboxes require some rather complex
locking operations which are unavailable on DOS.  Access will work, but the
protection afforded by this locking would be missing.  IMAP addresses these
problems, and is the recommended solution.

There will be external standalone programs to convert mailboxes between
different formats.

use the Take option to create a new alias from the address in the 
incoming message. Then return to the main menu, and enter the 
Addressbook; locate the mail list, and add the new alias to that list.

I'm quite happy to have both versions of PINE maintain the same set of 
mailboxes, with the PC version at least using IMAP to do so, but I 
evidently haven't got it set up to do so and I don't know how to do so - 
I think I'm in an RTFM situation here, but I don't have TFM! I pulled 
down the ZIP file from ftp.cac.washington.edu and it has installation 
notes etc but no manual - is there one I've missed?

Thanks for your message, Mark. I assume from your email address that 
you're part of the PINE team - ?

We have several users that receive mail that has MIME encoded attachments.
Some, like myself, prefer to receive our mail on a VMS system.  Only,
the attachments do not port.

Do you have a PINE version for VMS?  If so, how does one acquire it?

Also, is there an X-Windows version of PINE? 

Thanks in advance for your help.

Jim Finegan.

Please describe to us a bit more about how you have things set up, and we'll
try to help you figure out what to do next.

What do you set the inbox-path variable in your PC-Pine PINERC file?

Is there an IMAP server set up on your UNIX system?  [Do you know what this
means and/or how to determine if one is set up?]

You may find the file mail/pine-tech-notes on ftp.cac.washington.edu
(available via anonymous FTP) to be helpful as well.

Yes, I am the author of the c-client library which is the underlying mailbox
access engine used by Pine, imapd, and various other email tools.  I also
invented the IMAP protocol back in 1986.

In general, though, it's better to contact the Pine team by use of the email
address pine@cac.washington.edu than to contact individuals directly.  That
way, questions (and their answers) are seen by everyone.

I'm trying to determine what communications programs are compatable with
the 'attached-to-ansi' print option from a Mac.  I've determined Mac
Kermit doesnt work.  I know there is a UW hacked version of NCSA Telnet,
but I am looking for telecommunication programs that dial up via a modem. 

The only two suggestions I have had so far are Mac340 from White Pine
Software, and Versaterm Pro.  Are there any other programs that are known
to work?

John,

I think at least part of what you are seeing is because of the newline 
differences.  PC-Pine sees the Unix NL and interprets it as a DOS CRNL, 
but Unix Pine sees the DOS CRNL and interprets the CR as text!  The other 
problem is probably due to trying to display the CR...

The compatibility you are seeing is purely coincidental and not by design.  A
future version of Pine will allow access to remote addressbooks via IMAP 
which will resolve this problem.

 Hi all,
	What advantage or disadvantage I have when type two (o more) SMTP
servers in my file pine.conf on redvax1 system??? 

	Example : smtp-server=redvax1.dgsca.unam.mx,redvax2.dgsca.unam.mx
                                    ^
				    |- my system...

	It will help me to support the demand of electronic mail on my 
machine when "redvax1" is very busy???

	I did read the tech notes of pine about it... but I not understand
very well yet ... 
  Thank's in advance...

Pine will use the first server listed unless it fails to respond, in 
which case it tries the next one in the list.  If the second one fails to 
respond, it will try the third one, etc.

Hmm, Mac Kermit 0.99 works for me.  But some other that work well are 
Smartcom II, MicroPhone (almost any version, I think), VersaTerm and 
VersaTerm Pro, White Knight.

Be sure you have the latest version of Mac Kermit (I think it's 0.99 
(188)) and try again with that.  I'm surprised to hear you had trouble.  
Write me , if you like, with what else is going on.  With a former job I 
used to deal with lots of people who had terminal-emulation printing 
problems.

Suggest that ^C be accepted in more places to abort the current process;
for example:  if I enter "C"ompose, and in the 'To' line press ^T, now I 
am in the addressbook.  If I want to exit from the addressbook, I can use
"E"xit, but ^C also makes sense (to abort this immediate process -- using 
the addressbook and return to the composer; another ^C would be required 
to abort the composer).  -mr

I'm not sure if it has always been the case, or is a new change, but the 
notification of new mail from Pine 3.89 is

"New mail from xxxxx in point of Some subject or other"

"in point of"?? What is wrong with "re" or "about" or "Subject:"?

Please don't use three words, and perhaps ones without a clear meaning 
all through the English speaking world, when one will do.

Me too. I also would like the spell checking to display the incorrect
words in sequential order starting from the top of the message instead of
in alphabetical order causing too much screen changing particularly with
long messages.

Actually, sometimes the phrase constructed does not make any sense

I've looked in the source code and see that there are twelve different 
messages. This one is the only one  I find really offensive - some call 
me a pedant....

Please do not restore Re: (I would be happiest with Subject:, and about 
is OK). My non English first language users (and we have plenty!) find 
normal English hard enough, and "re" is not a word in basic english.

I noticed that different messages were being used when producing a
document about Pine.  I also checked the source, and found that 12
messages were possible and Pine "randomly" chooses one of them.  At the
time I thought this was rather quaint.  However, if you want to document
Pine (and I acknowledge that some would say that that is not needed), it
is helpful to have the same text each time. 

So, I would vote for "always the same text", and like other people I would
prefer "about" because it is reasonably short and not as obscure as "re".

	If we're voting count mine with theirs (to replace "in point 
of").  Maybe just a colon would do:

	"New mail from Joe:  Meeting tomorrow"

I am not so concerned with what is said as in its length.  Since the
information seems to be confined to one line I want to see more of who the
mail is from and what it is about and less boilerplate from pine.

A simple colon-space separator might be a language independent method.

    Er... 'about' is a nice plain english word, and might be understood 
better than 're:' which implies you know the word 'regarding.'

    I don't like 'in point of' myself. It sounds sloppy....

	[New mail! From ae103@city.ac.uk in point of Re: Bob]

    ....in point of regarding Bob. Hmmm....

    Perhaps you could have 'From xx@xx.xx about subject' and if the 
subject starts 'Re:' you have 'From xx@xx.xx in reply to subject.'

This is quite easy to change without even bothering to modify the
random selection by setting each of the 12 lines to the same thing.
I used "Subj:" for the text string.

I agree with always using the same text, and something short.  When I first
started using Pine, I noticed the messages having different text right
away, and it was confusing because I assumed there was some method to it. 
I don't think having Pine randomly choose phrases is a good thing - it
doesn't promote that feeling of consistency.

Charlie - It's worse than that!  The notification actually uses one of
several phrases selected at random from a list:
  - in re
  - about
  - in point of
  - apropos
  - concerning
  - a la
  - <etc> 

The original programmer probably thought that was a cute idea 
(like obscure command names in unix), but I feel it is simply confusing.  
Computer messages should (IMNSHO) present the relevant information in a 
consistent way.  The skeleton of the message should be -constant- so that 
the user's attention is drawn to the significant variable part: 
  - WHO the message is from and 
  - WHAT the message is about.  
The focus should be on the message not on the 'envelope'.  
I have been urging the pine folks to change this for a lonnnnng time.  
I'm glad to hear I'm not alone in my distaste for clever presentation.

My preference:
                [New mail! From: .....; Subject: ........]
because "From:" and "Subject:" are identical to the message header lines.
Why improvise when the standard words works just fine?  -mr

Please show the End-of-Message signal as soon as the last page of the
message is displayed.  This will save me pressing the space bar to be 
sure that I'm at the end.  

I would suggest the following.
  - If the entire message fits on one screen, show:    [ All ]
  - Moving down, when last screen is displayed, show:  [ End ]
  - Moving up, when first screen is displayed, show:   [ Top ]

In all cases:
  - display the signal at the bottom of the screen, in reverse video;
  - display the signal as soon as the condition is encountered,
    do not wait until I try to move beyond the end/top of the message.

This last is important.  Currently these signals are 'error messages' 
(you tried to read past the end of the message, dummy); if the signals 
were presented -as soon as- the condition occurred, they would become 
'status messages'.  Big difference in subjective feeling! 

THANK YOU PINE TEAM -- when resuming composition of a suspended message,
the cursor is now on the first line of the message, rather that on the
'To:" line.  Thank you much!  -mr

Subject: Quit pine -> "You have new mail." ???

Often, when I quit pine, I immediately get the message:
     You have new mail.
before the unix prompt.

I suspect this is because pine only checks for new mail every xx seconds, 
and it has not yet seen the new mail; so unix (cshell?) tells me about it
before presenting the unix prompt.

Suggestion:  As part of the pine 'quit' processing, check for new mail
and allow the user to read it before completing the pine 'quit' command.  
There is always the possibility of missing a new message that arrives 
just 'after' pine quits, but the window of lost messages will be smaller 
than it is now.  -mr

Well, there are some of us out here who do think it's a nice change from 
just the same old boring thing...  Since the code for randomness is 
already in there, if you do change it, please make it an option (perhaps 
something #defined at compile time) so those of us who like the 12 
messages can still have them?

I just discovered the <tab> key skips to the next new message

	I hadn't noticed that change.  Definitely an improvement.

Well, this thread is already so long, but I feel obliged to say I *love*
this suggestion.  That way the configuration kings could set up anything
they (we!) like, and the default could be the colon. 

One little change:  I'd rather do something elmish and use %f and %s for 
from and subject, and I'd rather not enumerate or limit the number of 
possibilities ...

new-mail-strings = "New mail! %f: %s",
                   "Yoo hoo! %f says %s",
                   "%s (from %f)"

And if the Pine team doesn't have enough to do :), I liked the idea of 
stripping out the Re: from a subject (optionally).  It could be done with

new-reply-strings = "%f replied to %s"

Always another suggestion, always another suggestion ... 

Norm

	This allows fun lovers to have their fun (and Stumbles' lines here 
are great) and still allows for some dull ": " default for those who are 
nervous about confusing users.  What a solution!

It's cute, but I don't think it's a good idea.  If pine is going to
have a million features, at least let them be things that are useful.

I vote for either "New mail from xxx: yyyyyyyyyy" or
		  "New mail! From: xxx; Subject yyyyyyyyyy",
but of those I like the plain ":" best.

I've been trying to setup a folder that many people could open up with
read-only access, and one designated person could read and write.  I tried
some variations on the methods in the attached message below, but couldn't
get anything to work with IMAP.  By the way, I want this folder to be
treated as an incoming folder. 

Right now, the only thing that works is

incoming-folders=incoming  {develop}/home/develop/compute/incoming

Then I just do some Unix group ownership tricks to allow only the owner of
the file to modify it.  However, this results in some strange messages and
weird behavior when opening the folder read-only, which I'd like to avoid
since it is confusing.  Anyone have any ideas how I can do this and still
use IMAP?

It seems to me that you asking for problems which will require
considerable programing to protect against when you let these strings be
configurable in the rc file.  Is the added complexity really worth it?

I agree,  why should we so serious about what it said on the message 
after a long day work.  Honestly, I never pay any attention to those 
message until this big discussion.  But if I have to vote one way or 
other, I would say the colon is the best idea.  Clear and Simple!

Please don't add anything like that.  I'd much prefer to see the existing
random strings removed and have a single terse, informative message
instead.  I'd get much more pleasure out of having a simpler, smaller
.pinerc file and associated code for reading and handling it than out of
having random strings.

How would you feel about having a #define in the Makefile which would 
switch between the original 12 random strings and your bor^H^H^Hproposed 
colon?

Elmar,
There shouldn't be any problem providing shared RO access to a folder via 
IMAP, but I don't know of any way to suppress the messages that warn the 
user that access is Read-Only.

Could you be more specific about the "wierd behavior" you referred to?

I'm not sure if this is a problem with my terminal emulation program but 
using ^^-key as the mark command is rather hard on finnish keyboards.  
On finnish keyboards the ^-key is a "dead" accent key: it isn't complete 
until it's followed by another key (the key to be accented with the 
"hat").

Unfortunately, pressing control and the key with the "^" cap on my
terminal does not produce a control-^.  To get a ^^ I must hit
control-shift-6!  I had no problems finding this out as I know the US
keyboard layout well but for persons who have never seen a US keyboard
(and probably never will) this is very peculiar as the shift-6 normally 
produces an ampersand (&) on finnish keyboards.

Oh well, it's probably too late to change anything.  I only wish that the 
special keys were configurable to some extent.

Are there any options in the .prinerc file or compile flags that can be 
set to make pine/pico appropriate for a captive e-mail account only? 
Basically I want to keep e-mail only users from being able to leave their 
home directory via the ^T to files type stuff.
Even though I use the restricted shell pine/pico still allows them to 
move about.

Just thought I would ask before I go start digging through the 
code.

Thanks
Jamie

I'd like to cast my vote in the "who cares" pool.  I never even noticed 
it until this group started talking about it.  Consistent user 
interface?  A very noble goal.  But we never see it in life.

What's shaking, how you doing, good morning, you're a sight for sore 
eyes, what's happening.  All good greetings.

I say work on something more important (anything is.)

Which particular restricted shell are you talking about? We operate with
a restricted shell developed in perl locally. We have also restricted the
use of certain options within Pine (such as the alternative-editor-command
and the personal print command) on a system-wide basis since these are the
major holes through which our users attempt to escape. 

We run Pine 3.89 under SunOs 4.1.3 (unix) on two 10/51s with a telnet
interface on one machine, and imap/pop access on the other.

If this is of interest to you, then surely you are welcome to the sum of
our shared experience...

What we do here is to log them into a chroot environment that only
has absolutely what that user needs to operate.  Everything except
their directory, tmp, and /var/spool is mounted read-only.  If they
do look around, all they won't see any other user's files anyway.
We run from a menu instead of a shell however.

Alan,

The simple way to do this is to do this is to set your alternate-editor 
to ispell, then '^_' in the composer magically becomes ispell.

I'm not sure this is the correct way, but I just created the following 
script and named it "spell."

#!/bin/sh
ispell -l | sort | uniq

It pretty much mimics spell's behavior.  Of course, there's probably a 
better way, but this has worked for me.

Terry,

The first message is:

      [-no folder- : Can't get write access to mailbox, access is readonly]

...and then:

      [Folder "incoming" opened with 4 messages READONLY]

...accompanied by a beep.  The second message seems to be delayed for a
moment, which is expected, but can be confusing for our intermediate
users.  If I want ten people to open a given folder read-only as often as
once every five minutes, and one person to open it read-write, my little
system seems less than attractive. 

If this is not the most efficient method, perhaps someone on the list can
put me on the path towards something better.  Would an internal news
server be the answer?  And would I still be able to control the access on
an individual?  And would it be worth the time to try and fire up news
just for this purpose?  Any answers and hints are welcome, send them to 
ekurgpol@law.usc.edu.

Thanks,

	Elmar

Hmmm.  pine-request@cac.washington.edu does not seem to be a valid
email address..  That means, I have no idea how to unsubscribe without 
bothering everybody's mailbox.  Sorry...

Please remove me from the pine mailing lists.  Not enough time anymore, 
and the next major release seems far in the future.

Take care!

I hope the following is an accurate summary of the ways you can 
use ispell with pine.  Please correct as necessary.
I think we should have a pine FAQ, and this should go in it.

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>
 - Set 'editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell' in your '.pinerc' file.
 - See 'man ispell' for more information on the ispell program.

Now, when you press ^_ (^-) in pine, you will execute the 'ispell'
program in its native mode.  Press "?" for help.  Press "I" to 
insert unknown words into the personal dictionary.  You can still
press ^T to use the standard pine spell-checking program (which 
will -not- use your personal dictionary).

From: David L Miller <dlm@cac.washington.edu>
Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable.  I notice that someone
posted a shell script that allows ispell to be used like spell, ...
 
From: Mike Grupenhoff <kashmir@snare.dorm.umd.edu>
I'm not sure this is the correct way, but I just created the following 
script and named it "spell."
     #!/bin/sh

It pretty much mimics spell's behavior.  Of course, there's probably a 
better way, but this has worked for me.

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>
To make ^T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words' dictionary:
 - make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory
 - make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell'
 - set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL $HOME/spell'
   (you may include this command in your .cshrc or .login file)

Now, when you press ^T in pine, you will execute the 'ispell' program, 
and it will recognize words stored in the private dictionary.  The 
screen display will look like pine is using the standard spell-checking 
program.  Unfortunately, this method does not allow the user to "I"nsert
words into the private dictionary.  However, this might be useful with a
central script file (setenv SPELL ...)  and a central private dictionary
(ispell -p ...)  to provide a common private dictionary for an entire 
workgroup.  The manager could add items to the private dictionary; 
ordinary pine users would use the private dictionary (^T), but they 
could not change it.

Elmar,
If the first message was suppressed, would that meet your needs?

You can certainly build a pseudo-newsgroup, but updating it is not quite
as convenient as just using a simple mailbox format. 

The question of when/how to display ReadOnly-ness is non-trivial, since
there are several degrees of ReadOnly-ness.  (For example, newsgroups are
not completely read-only because you can set one flag (D) that gets saved
in your .newsrc.  In the future there will be other variations on this 
theme as well.)

Pine folks:  Please consider implementing ispell as the standard 
spell-checker in pine, and provide modified ispell commands 
which can be used when a misspelled word is presented, such as:
  <enter>      accept the word for the entire file (no change)
  <arrows...><enter>  accept -modified- word for entire file (no change?)
  ^I           accept the word and insert it in the private dictionary
  <arrows...>^I  accept the -modified- word and insert in dictionary
  ^R           replace entire word; clear edit field, cursor in col 1
  ^Snn<enter>  substitute one of the suggested words from the list
               (clear the edit field, like ^R, and show:
                   "Replace with word number: __"
  ^C           abort spell checking (no change)
Retain '$HOME/.ispell-words' as the private dictionary file for 
compatibility with standard ispell.  
Thanks, -mr

I think the handling of error messages in Pine is pretty bad. It seems to 
me, whenever Pine wants to display an error message, it puts the message 
on an internal queue. The messages on the queue are displayed one at a 
time, with a pause between them. During this, the user can go around 
doing other things, making more error or no errors at all. The messages 
keep being displayed. Very annoying, especially as a displayed message 
has nothing at all to do with what the user has done in the last couple 
of seconds.

A simple way to demonstrate this, is to start Pine without -z, ie not 
suspendable, and then pressing CNTRL/Z some ten times. After that, start 
reading mail, composing mail, whatever.

Is this a bug in the implementation of UNIX/Pine 3.89?

Klaus,
We agree.

The fact that Pine displays some messages after they are no longer relevant,
thus causing confusion, is definitely a known bug, and it is definitely on
the list of things we want to improve this year.  (As usual, I can't predict
exactly when.)

	Sometimes ^C would be welcome where it is not available.  I was 
reading a letter in my inbox and wanted to print it.  I don't often do 
that, so I forgot what letter of the alphabet is used to print mail this 
week.  I remembered it wasn't "P".  So I tried "L."  Naturally I got into 
a screen allowing me to change folders.  I didn't want to be there.  I 
wanted to return to what I was.  But no, ^C wouldn't let me do that.  I 
had to return to the main menu, go from there to the index, then down to 
the message I was reading, then read that.  A simple ^C would have been 
easier.

Hi All, 
I have just downloaded 3.89 and I have encountered a problem with the 
arrow keys that I did not have in 3.05. [C[C[D[D[A

(if you see what I mean) the arrrow keys splurge their escape sequences 
all over the text, and dont move the cursor. As I downloaded the linux 
binary, is this simply broken, or is it a bug introduced in the new pine?

...As long as people who don't use ispell aren't overlooked!

There is something positive to be said for using a "standard utility" 
that is present on virtually every UNIX system under the sun as against 
some optional software that MAY have been installed.

Options screen
--------------
Perhaps when Pine is released with Options screen(s) in place, it could
include twelve "mail notification" prefix messages so that: 

1.  users who prefer variety could enter twelve individual messages.
2.  those who like consistency could repeat the same text 12 times.
3.  those who have no preference could have 12 default messages.

For novice users, editing .pinerc can be very confusing with lots of '{}'
, '[]' and '/' characters and sometimes cryptic syntax, etc.  Options
screen(s) will dramatically improve Pine's ease of configuration, and
could include further checks for curly brace matching / news & imap
syntax, etc. 

Could someone in the Pine team please give an idea of when the options
screen(s) are likely to be available? 

Thanks,

Dave

Well, maybe I'm the computer illiterate; I didn't realize that 'ispell' is
not available on every unix system.  It certainly would be helpful if
users could add words to the spell-check dictionary.  I get tired of being
told that weekday abbreviations are spelled wrong, and my last name, and
'diskette', 
'telnet', 
'email'(!), etc. 
   I can see the advantage of using a standard unix utility (spell).  Is
'ispell' hard to obtain & install?  Is it worth building 'ispell' hooks
into pine? 
   In the meantime ... If ispell is installed on your system, andif you
want to use it (so you can add words to the spelling dictionary), follow
the detailed instructions in my earlier summary message describing how to: 
(1) use ispell in native mode (via the ^_ key), and (2) use ispell in pine
mode (via the ^T key and an executable script file).  If you missed that
message, let me know and I will send or repost it.  If you have any 
corrections to that message, please let me know.  Thanks to all who
explained the details of ispell.  I like it!  

P.S.:  In spell-checking this message (using 'spell' via ^T key), 
I discovered the following anomaly:
 - the following 1 line produces 3 spelling errors:
and 'diskette', 'telnet', 'email'(!), etc. 
 - the following 3 lines produce -no- spelling errors:
'diskette', 
'telnet', 
'email'(!), etc. 
BUT WAIT ... If you spell check this message just as it is before you, 
the three errors (email, diskette, telnet) will be reported in the list
at the top of the message, BUT ... if you remove this P.S. and run the
spell-check again, NO ERRORS will be reported!  SO ... the errors are
being -found- in the sentence:
... and 'diskette', 'telnet', 'email'(!), etc. 
but the errors are being -reported- at the first occurrence of the words
in the message (the list at the top).  Very strange!  What's up?  
   When I checked the spelling using ispell native mode (via the ^_ key),
the three words (email, diskette, telnet) were -always- reported; but once
I add them to my private dictionary, I'll never see them again.  AND ...
ispell even told me that 'occurrance' should be spelled 'occurrence' and
allows me to make the replacement by pressing just one key!  
I like ispell.  -mr

To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
X-Vmsmail-To: SMTP%"pine-info@cac.washington.edu"

A few months ago, when we started to promote Pine use heavily on campus, I
experimented with use of ispell instead of spell with Pine.  It didn't work
as I expected ... or in an effective way.  That is, ispell was invoked but
it looked as though Pine only expected to provide a line or two at the
bottom of the screen for spell checking (which is fine with spell), but
ispell wants to clear the screen and allow more display and interaction,
with the result that the screen cleared and a bunch of ispell info appeared
but I could not really interact with ispell at that point.  This was while
running as a VT100 terminal, BTW.  Was I overlooking something?  Does
someone have this actually working?  I can't remember every combination of
flags that I tried, but I did look at some of them that seemed to promise a
more limited ispell on-screen display.

The following works for me.  I prefer native mode (via the ^_ key).  
It allows me to use all the features of ispell.  Good luck!  -mr

I hope the following is an accurate summary of the ways you can 
use ispell with pine.  Please correct as necessary.
I think we should have a pine FAQ, and this should go in it.

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>
 - Set 'editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell' in your '.pinerc' file.
 - See 'man ispell' for more information on the ispell program.

Now, when you press ^_ (^-) in pine, you will execute the 'ispell'
program in its native mode.  Press "?" for help.  Press "I" to 
insert unknown words into the personal dictionary.  You can still
press ^T to use the standard pine spell-checking program (which 
will -not- use your personal dictionary).

From: David L Miller <dlm@cac.washington.edu>
Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable.  I notice that someone
posted a shell script that allows ispell to be used like spell, ...
 
From: Mike Grupenhoff <kashmir@snare.dorm.umd.edu>
I'm not sure this is the correct way, but I just created the following 
script and named it "spell."
     #!/bin/sh
     ispell -l | sort | uniq
It pretty much mimics spell's behavior.  Of course, there's probably a 
better way, but this has worked for me.

From: Mike Ramey <mramey@u.washington.edu>
To make ^T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words' dictionary:
 - make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory
 - make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell'
 - set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL $HOME/spell'
   (you may include this command in your .cshrc or .login file)

Now, when you press ^T in pine, you will execute the 'ispell' program, 
and it will recognize words stored in the private dictionary.  The 
screen display will look like pine is using the standard spell-checking 
program.  Unfortunately, this method does not allow the user to "I"nsert
words into the private dictionary.  However, this might be useful with a
central script file (setenv SPELL ...)  and a central private dictionary
(ispell -p ...)  to provide a common private dictionary for an entire 
workgroup.  The manager could add items to the private dictionary; 
ordinary pine users would use the private dictionary (^T), but they 
could not change it.

	Ah, but you CAN add words with the standard spell.  I do.  I have 
a file called "mydic" (no jokes please) with the words I want added, then 
in my .profile (or whatever your shell requires) I have the lines:

SPELL="spell +mydic"
export SPELL

This then causes spell whenever it runs to use "mydic" as a supplemental 
dictionary.  (You should be able to do this with an alias too.)

	I don't know ispell, so maybe there are other advantages to that, 
but if having a customizable dictionary is what you are looking for, you 
don't have to look that far.

The ispell program allows insertion of unknown words into the dictionary
-during- spell checking (press the "I" key); it also offers suggested
correct spellings when it discovers an unknown word (select a replacement
by pressing a number key).  Try it if it's on your system.  -mr

Everything I've seen so far relates to using ispell with pine, not pico.
I just tried the ^_ key in pico, and it is an 'unknown command'.
Pine-folks:  Is ^_ (alternate composer) supported in -pico-?
             Is there a .picorc file?  Should there be?
             How can we get ispell (native mode!) to work in -pico-?

Ahhh... before y'awl do that little thing, be sure 'ispell' is a
standard speller available for/on any pine (unix/aix) platform.

Having said that, what is 'ispell'?  Where do I get it?  Will it run on
aix?

(By the way, sorry for that previous message, when I realized I was
responding to the wrong one I hit control-X instead of control-C.  Guess
my nerves are still a little rattled from the earthquake :-}

Terry,

If the first message were suppressed, I think that would be alright.  But
really what I am most interested in is suppressing the beep.  I'd prefer
my system not warn me (especially audibly) about something I fully
intended to do ("Psst, excuse me, did you know your fly is up?").  I think
it would be beneficial to have an option on an IMAP folder to specify
read-only, although I would agree that it may not be the most popular Wish
to be added to The List.  I'm no programmer, but it seems that Pine can
figure out if a file is read-only for itself, it should be fairly easy to 
tell it what to expect ahead of time ;-)

I've also wanted a control-C to cancel out of folder selection.  I realize
that the name of the folder I have open is at the top of the screen, but
if I didn't want to go to the folder list anyways it may take me a few
seconds to figure out where I am.

I've just been tidying up my mailboxes, saving a lot of the mail which I
have read in other mailboxes, and then changing into another mailbox 
shows the messages as unread! Is this a bug or a feature?

(Using PC Pine 3.89 with IMAP to access mailboxes)

I certainly agree about working on important things, but please remember
all the time that while this mail list no doubt contains a number of
computer freaks (sorry, experienced computer users :-)), users of PINE
(mine at any rate) are on average anything but; they include Poles,
Czecks, Italians, Nigerians, Ghanaians, CHinese, Japanese, and so on; some
have a hard time with English and all they want is ease of use, simplicity
of language, and predictability. So "nice features to stop something 
being bor<del>,del><del> predictable" should definitely NOT appear on the work 
list.
On the other hand, I would guess that cutting out the "produce a random 
string" code would be the work of a moment.

There - that does feel better! :-)

Hi! Everyone:

I got a compile problem here.  I tried to compile pine3.89 on AIX 2.2, but
it didn't work.  Some one told me that I have to change cc to bsdcc in
order to compile the proram.  Then I changed cc to bsdcc in the build
script.  That made me have pico only and some warnings.  Afterwards he
said I have to add the command of -D and change the compiler variables to 
-D_NONSTD_TYPES and -D_NO_PROTO.  What I should change in build script?  

Thanks for your help.

I think this is because spell only prints out each misspelling once, no 
matter how many times it occurs.  (The script I posted does this, because 
listing each error multiple times doesn't jive well with pine.)

I have no proof, but I'm guessing that pine remembers which words you
didn't correct in previous spell checks, and won't keep harrassing you
about them on subsequent checks.  Therefore, pine remembered you saying
that email, diskette, and telnet were ok, and passed over them in the
second spell check.

Another point regarding error messages being queued and appearing when 
they are no longer relevant, if a save is done to a non-existant folder, 
the user is prompted about whether to create the folder or not. Then 
oafter the user says yes, and the message is saved in the newly created 
folder, the system error message "No such file or directory" is 
displayed.

This message should never be placed in the error message queue.

I've been stuffing my password into PC Pine to save typing it every time I
run Pine (dodgy, I know, but hacking around with the setup I fire it up
and close it down so many times it gets tedious). 

Anyway, yesterday Pine suddenly asks me if I'd like the password saved on
disk. I don't know what I did to make it do so - I had just reduced my
folder-collections from 2 to 1 which was IMAP-accessed, so maybe that was
it. 

And I don't suppose the protection it gives is very strong - it is
encrypted, but it's the same number of characters as the password - but
it's better than having the password floating about in plain text as I
had! 

What i'd like to know is (1) how one can intentionally get Pine to do 
this, and (2) how I can get Unix Pine to do the same?

Oh and whether there's a plain text or postscript manual for Pine around 
(there's a file pine-info which is almost 200K and has some wierd 
MAN-page type formatting in it, and I'm told there's a postscript file 
'amongst the sources' but our ftp connection to ftp.cac.washington is a 
bit flaky and I haven't yet found it. If anyone's got a copy could they 
attach it (possibly ZIPped up) and send it to me? Thanks.

PC-PINE Will do this if there is a file PINE.SIG in \PINE; this contains 
the encrypted PW; if this is not accepted by the remote Unix, then PINE 
will request the PW and ask if you want to store it.

NO.  If the message contains only the list, no spelling errors are found;
if the message contains only the one-line phrase, 3 errors are found. -mr

First,
	Thanks to all who responded to my questions re: getting .forwrd 
files to work with filter.
The problem was that I was logging on to a different machine than our MTA 
(sendmail) thought I should.  So I was putting .forward in one alias for 
$HOME and sendmail was looking to another.  No one on campus could help 
but with a little trial and error I found out.  Well, now I have no 
problem forwarding mail using .forward but I can't get it piped into a 
program (filter).  If I both forward and attempt to filter it the 
recipient gets an error message. It looks like the pipe feature of 
sendmail is inactive on campus.  That I will work out with our postmaster 
or sysadmin.

In the mean time I have .cshrc execute the script from the elm faq to 
sort my mail on login.  The problem is that if a piece of mail isn't 
nabbed by one of the filter rules it is recopied into the inbox. And the 
messages that do fit a filter rule are copied into the assigned folder 
but they are also left in my inbox.  Do I need to give a delete dommand 
too?  If so, how do I apply multiple actions to a single message?

thanks for all the help, I think I'm getting close.
Dan

        Is there a way in PC-Pine 3.89 to set the name of  the  folder
        used  by default for Saves?  It defaults to "savemail", but as
        I have a remote folder collection used as the default I  would
        prefer   to   use   "saved-messages".    I   did   notice  the
        "saved-msg-name-rule=" option in NEWSRC, but it doesn't appear
        to have the option of choosing a specific name.

I came a cropper on this one so I'll share it with the list - if there's 
a FAQ list maybe it should go in there?

Using PC-Pine with IMAP to access folders on a Unix host one has to set
folder-collections, documented in the comments in PINERC as follows (3.89):

# folder-collections specifies a list of folder collections wherein saved
# messages are stored. The first collection is the default for saves.
# Collection syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}optnl-directory-path[]
# Example:
# folder-collections=Saved-Email    {foo.bar.edu}mail/[],

Although with 20:20 hindsight it is obvious that the form:
	{imapserver}directory/[] 
applies, I set it as:
	{imapserver}directory\[] 
(because I was using PC-Pine) and this resulted in the mail folders on
my Unix filesystem being 
	~/mail\folder1
	~/mail\folder2 
	etc
rather than
	~/mail/folder1 
	etc
- i.e. with a backslash in each name.

Dear PINE developers,
let me suggest several add-ons to your excellent program.
I use it everyday and I am very satisfied with it.
I came to PINE after notice of Barry Bouwsma in our local BITNET discussion
list csinfo-l where  we had been just discussing methods of processing
of incoming mail from listservers. Soon  after my comment that the Save
should be done also by Sender field Barry modified the source of v 3.85
and I am glad that you have included this in later versions

After long time of usage of PINE I have several other ideas how to improve
the management of mail from discussion lists:

1)  The sort-key option should include value "sender", so I could have all
    mail from each listserver displayed together. Inside this should be
    applied the option arrival. 

2) Some listservers have very unconvenient Sender field that says little 
about the subject of the list (e.g. one Czech discussion list on SCO 
machine have sender field   maiser.). So it would be nice to have some
other configuration file (say .pinesaveto) which would map the sender:
field to actual name of folder (including path)

3)  Other improvement could allow the save command from index screen with
possibility of selection of several messages together (some form of marking
-highlighting)  and all messages from each sender.

4) Other configuration option (say header-display  with values from:, 
sender:, recipient ... ) should change a form of presentation of headers 
in index. The from: field in massages form listserver is not very useful -
better is sender:  (but may left as it is if the sort-by-sender will be 
used) 

5) For sending mail to international and local lists would be nice to have
two various signatures (one in local language and in English). In BSD mail
is the option ~A   ~a   for appending the .Signature  and .signature 
files respectively. I suggest the usage of some key to include the 
.Signature file or .signature          and have the possibility not to
append it just after start of composing (say option   choose-signature)

6) There should be a possibility during Sending message to invoke a sendmail
with -v (verbose mode) that displays a SMTP conversation between machines.
It is useful when you try a new address and you are not sure wheather it is
right or if you need to see that the massage was delivered to the target 
machine (to recipient) just now.
I suggest either an  auxiliary question 
"Verbose sending ? [n]:" after ^X (Send) or two cases of Send command
^X  normal send in background
^x  verbose mode. 


I know that for processing of mail-lists there are better programs 
(e.g.procmail) but these will save incoming messages in time of delivery.
But I want to see what has just come alltogether and then sort to various 
folders myself but with smallest effort (saving keystrokes).

Let me know, please, whether you have accepted any my suggestion and what 
form of its implementation will be used. 


Regards,

This is a good suggestion.  We will also have other ways to group 
messages in the next version of Pine.  e.g. you will be able to Zoom in 
on a set of messages.

The handling of the Sender field by listserv is very unfortunate.  There 
have been some other suggestions how to handle a save-by-alias operation, 
but we have not decided on a strategy yet.

This is coming in the next version of Pine.

This is an interesting suggestion.  We will have to give it some 
consideration.

Several variations of this have been suggested.  For now, you might try 
naming your signature files .s and .S, then use ^R to read in the 
appropriate one on each message.

Hmmm...  This would definitely be a power-user feature...

BTW, ^x and ^X are the same character...

Subject: 'A' & 'N' msg status
To: Pine Information <pine-info@cac.washington.edu>
Message-Id: <Pine.3.89.9401261749.A5654-0100000@adm1.bris.ac.uk>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

'A' status
----------
When a message has been answered using (R)eply, the message's status 
field is updated to show an 'A' - as expected.

If however, a reply is *postponed* and resumed, the status field is not 
updated to indicate that an (A)nswer has been mailed.

I've had a quick look at the code and I see that it's the c-client that
does the updating of X-Status. I don't know how easily this anomaly
could be resolved, so is it worthwhile either: 

1. indicating in Pine's help that 'A' is not infallible.
2. Amend Pine and/or the c-client to cope with postponed replies - maybe 
   a lot of work ...


'N' status
----------
Pine's help on this field (in common with all other mailers I know of)
states that this message is 'new' but in fact I've noticed that if a
message 'comes in' and is *not* read, it's 'Status:' field changes to:

Status: RO  = OLD
Status:  O  = SEEN but *not* READ

When the mailbox is rewritten on exit. I think I've got this the right 
way around!

With this information, it should be possible to present on entry to a 
folder (INBOX?) information to convey how many messages have:

1. Previously arrived, and have not been read (Unseen).
2. Just arrived (New).
3. Previously arrived and have been read (Old).

This information is used here when our menu system initialises to inform 
the user that there may be messages that need reading (New & Unseen).

Pine must parse the mailbox at the moment to setup the status flag display
so would it be worthwhile having a 'U' flag to indicate the message's
'unread' status? (although I know many mailers use 'U' to indicate
urgent). Is this worthwhile information? 

Maybe I'm being pedantic but should a 'new' message really be a brand-new
message and not an unread message that has previously been 'seen' in the
index?

When I tidy up my inbox, I read my messages and save them to the 
appropriate folders. As I save each message it is marked as deleted in 
the current mailbox. I have to press 'N' to move to the next message.

I would like PINE automatically to skip to the next undeleted message. 

(One could still get into a message marked as deleted, from the index, by
pointing to it and hitting ENTER)

Possibly this behaviour could be controlled by a flag, like 
delete-skips-deleted.

When tagging becomes available I would like a similar behaviour i.e. when 
reading each message and skipping to the next/previous with N/P that Pine 
jumps past already tagged messages.

I'm looking for a software package that will read and write mime encoded
messages.  I was hoping pine would do this for me.  After downloading pine,
I read all the text file I could find but could not find the answers I need.

Because of my situation, I have to read mail from over a modem connection
into our college.  I have NO access to system file from the Vax (we use
SMTP). I would like to download my mail over a modem onto my pc.  Then
decodand read (or visualize and listen to) my mail.  I do have a sound blaster.  To my understanding, mime messages can be told to retrive files from other
systems when reading the mail.  I would like to be able to identify this
option to extract the address and directory tree since I would not be able to
do this with the configuration I'm hoping for.  But I could go out at some 
other tito these files.  I know this may seem like a system that is less then
desirable but this is the only way I could read mime messages without having
access to the mainframe or its system files.

If pine can not do what I need, please direct me in the right direction.
After reading the files to configure pine I have realized that this is not
very user friendly (no software for mime I have found is user friendly).
Even a commercial software that can accomplish my goals without having to be
an internet or system administrator expert would be nice.

If I have sent this message to the wrong address please let me know and 
send it to the appropriate location.  If you believe the pi mailing list
could help, please add my address to it.

I, too, have noticed this bug.  Ideally I'd like to see the "A" flag set 
correctly, but guess there may be context saving problems (for example 
the message you're replying to may be deleted before the postponed reply 
is actually sent?)

I agree that with this information it certainly SHOULD be possible to to 
have "New", "Old" and "Unseen" (Elm does it).

HOWEVER one of the nice things about Pine IMHO is that it DOESN'T (by 
default) do this.  Trying to explain the subtleties of the difference 
between the three cases to new or naive users is not easy.  IWhen we 
moved from Elm to Pine I was glad to see the back of this.

If the Powers That Be do decide to re-introduce this PLEASE let it be 
configurable offable!

I think that the distinction between new messages and unseen messages is 
one that most users neither understand nor want. (I understand it but I 
do not want it.) Pine should continue to treat these as equivalent.

  I was wondering if there was a way in pine to extract a message and keep
all headers (that is if you have "full header" display on and extract a
message, I would like all headers saved in the file)?  I would also like
it if there was an option to turn on "keep all headers" in an included
forwarded message.  

Thanks.

That's actually what save message does.  You can give any file name to 
the save command and Pine will write the message with full headers to 
it.  Save defaults to the ~/mail directory, where export defaults to the 
home directory.  There's a few other differences too, for example save 
locks the target file first.

Sherry,
  If you use "S"ave, all the headers are preserved.  So when I need full 
headers I "S"ave to whatever file is appropriate.  To include all those 
headers in a forwarded message you could '^R"ead in the file.
  Pine does have an option to include headers in reply, but you only get 
four lines of headers, as shown in your message below.

This has proved troublesome to us too. We have suffered some incidents of 
mail spoofing, and the person investigating always says "please send me the 
offending message, including all the headers". The trouble is that it is 
usually inexperienced users who suffer these incidents, and they are just 
the ones who can't even display the headers, let alone forward them...

   I just joined this group a week ago, and I see a lot of suggestions,
so I guess they are welcomed by the designers.  I'll put my two cents
in, let me know if you want any more of my money.

   First, I'd rather see the number of lines in a message in the index
instead of the number of characters it has.  I don't receive that much
mime, and so lines is a bit more useful to me.  Perhaps that should be an
option.

   Second, why does the 'To:' line require commas between members of a
list? I don't know much about mail programs, but I thought all addresses
had to be one word, and so I'd like to see Pine parse each word regardless
of whether it has a comma after it or not, and insert the commas for me if
I forget.  This sounds do-able to me, even if aliases can be multi-word.

Thanks for listening.

I'm not sure this will solve the problem but it's an idea. It's not
currently the default, but if you set enable-forward-as-MIME and have the
user answer "y" to the "forward as MIME" question the message is forwarded
with all it's headers.  The recipient only sees the full headers of the
message if they turn on full headers so it would even be a reasonable
default behavior in an all Pine or all MIME environment.  Hopefully
someday we'll have the ability to reply-to/save/forward messages that are
forwarded in MIME format (the message forward message is like an
attachment).

Sherry - I saved your message in the pine folder named 'z' (which I use
for temporary storage only), which is equivalent to "E"xtracting the
message.  Then I composed a message and ^R(ead) in the file 'z' from my
'mail' directory, which is equivalent to forwarding the message.  The
results are below.  Of course, now I must delete the 'z' folder so it will
be empty for my next use.  The only thing I find strange is that the first
line of the saved message is:

  I was wondering if there was a way in pine to extract a message and keep
all headers (that is if you have "full header" display on and extract a
message, I would like all headers saved in the file)?  I would also like
it if there was an option to turn on "keep all headers" in an included
forwarded message.  

Thanks.

When Mac Kermit users print to an attached-ansi printer, we are seeing 
Kermit Capture Buffer overflows, and much of longer messages is lost.  
I cannot find a way to set the size of the Capture Buffer, or otherwise 
prevent it from overflowing....Could someone tell me how to enlarge the 
capture buffer....

Hello, 
	I sent this out last week. To any who answered, please mail your 
responses again if possible.  It seems my .forward file was causing all 
of my mail to be dumped into the great cyber abyss.


---------- Forwarded message ----------
Date: Tue, 25 Jan 1994 09:44:20 -0800 (PST)
From: Daniel D. Todd <ez006683@bullwinkle.ucdavis.edu>
To: pine-info <pine-info@cac.washington.edu>
Subject: filter, cont. 

First,
	Thanks to all who responded to my questions re: getting .forward 
files to work with filter.
The problem was that I was logging on to a different machine than our MTA 
(sendmail) thought I should.  So I was putting .forward in one alias for 
$HOME and sendmail was looking to another.  No one on campus could help 
but with a little trial and error I found out.  Well, now I have no 
problem forwarding mail using .forward but I can't get it piped into a 
program (filter).  If I both forward and attempt to filter it the 
recipient gets an error message. It looks like the pipe feature of 
sendmail is inactive on campus.  That I will work out with our postmaster 
or sysadmin.

In the mean time I have .cshrc execute the script from the elm faq to 
sort my mail on login.  The problem is that if a piece of mail isn't 
nabbed by one of the filter rules it is recopied into the inbox. And the 
messages that do fit a filter rule are copied into the assigned folder 
but they are also left in my inbox.  Do I need to give a delete dommand 
too?  If so, how do I apply multiple actions to a single message?

thanks for all the help, I think I'm getting close.
Dan

Sounds like there's something wrong with your include files (gcc uses its
own set of includes as you can see).  Did you run fixincludes during the
gcc installation process?  Did you re-run fixincludes when you upgraded
from Solaris 2.2 to Solaris 2.3 (provided, of course, that you had been
running Solaris 2.2 previously and your gcc was installing under 2.2)? 

This is just the reason I demanded that I get a "real" SparcWorks C 
compiler when we upgrade to Solaris 2.x.  I'm sure that gcc is a good 
compiler WHEN you get it properly installed, but it's just too much 
hassle for me.

We run Pine on a multi-user Sun box, in the normal configuration where 
mail is delivered into /var/spool/mail/<userid>.

A problem that is now beginning to hit us is that new users of computers 
don't appreciate that their INBOX is actually in a different filing 
system to their other folders, and they tend to leave all their mail in 
the INBOX (many of them don't even know how to move it to another 
folder). Consequently, our mail partition is beginning to show signs of 
strain.

There are obviously various measures we can take to relieve this, but it 
was pointed out that Pine is different to many other MUAs in this area. 
MH, for example, always copies the messages out of the INBOX when you 
read them. Elm won't exit with messages still in the INBOX unless you 
tell it to leave them there; by default it copies them to a folder called 
(if I remember correctly) "saved-messages".

We don't want to deliver mail into users' home directories, for a number 
of reasons (possible non-availability if remote, and unexpected and 
unpredictable exhaustion of quota being two main ones). 

Could you consider adding to Pine a feature like that of Elm, whereby the 
user is asked whether (s)he would like to have any mail remaining in the 
INBOX moved to a folder on exiting from Pine? Preferably controlled by an 
option in the global conf file.

Regards,
Philip

Just in case you have not tried this, increas the memory size of 
MacKermit itself...  If you have thought of this, then I have no useful 
suggestion, except that I hava not (yet) had any buffer overflows...(my 
MacKermit is set to 1024...)

Good luck.

In 3.8x there's a

entry in .pinerc. This can be set to old-mail, etc etc.

Just what I was going to say! I use it for my own use of PINE.

The only problem is that the system default is off (no action). For unix 
users the system config could be changed (in which case I suppose there 
would be no way of turning it off in the local .pinerc, only overriding 
with a different value); for PC-PINE users the only hope is persuasion.

The compile line I get is something like this:

     gcc -DSV4 -O2   -ansi -DANSI  -c  addrbook.c

I have included my notes from when I first compiled pine-3.89 under
Solaris.  I just recompiled it again using gcc-2.5.8 under Solaris-2.3 and
had no problems. 

Unfortunately, just doing "build sol" isn't sufficient to get everything
to compile.  You also have to fiddle with some of the files.  Perhaps my
notes will help.....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile pine on Solaris using gcc:

1.  Under the distribution source directory, edit pine/makefile.sol.  
    Specify the following make variables:

    CC=	gcc
    CFLAGS=	-DSV4 $(OPTIMIZE) $(PROFILE) $(DEBUG) -ansi -DANSI
    LDCC= gcc

2.  In pine/osdep, edit the file os-sv4.h and make the following
    modifications:

    /*----------------- Are we ANSI? -----------------------------*/
    #define ANSI          /* this is an ANSI compiler */

    /*  #define	const		/* compiler doesn't support const */

3.  Under the distribution source directory, edit pico/makefile.sol.  
    Specify the following make variables:

    CC= gcc
    LDCC= gcc
    CFLAGS=	-Dsv4 -DPOSIX -DJOB_CONTROL -ansi

4.  Now actually get everything compiled.  For the final version, I
    compile it as follows:

    % ./build sol CC="gcc" OPTIMIZE="-O2" DASHO="-O2" DEBUG=""

You have two choices....

1)  Use the .pinerc variable (already mentioned in other replies) to set 
a "read messages" folder.  Remember this can be set globally in the 
system Pine configuration file if you wish.

However this moves the read messages into a totally separate folder that 
is treated just as any other folder (ie, quite separate from the INBOX).  
This means that users must explicitly open this folder in order to 
re-read messages they have already read once.

Doesn't sound too bad, perhaps, but it's similar to the NEWMAIL and MAIL 
folders in VAX/VMS MAIL, which I found quite difficult to explain to 
people at times.

A better choice might be...

2)  Modify the Pine source code to call the mboxdriver routines *before* 
the bezerkdriver routines when it is initialising the list of mail 
drivers (I think it's in the main pine.c file from memory).  [Basically 
it's a case of add one line in two places.]

The mbox driver causes mail in the INBOX to be (silently) moved to a file 
called "mbox" in the user's home directory.  This is then opened and 
treated as the INBOX.

The upshot is that sendmail (or whatever) delivers mail to your system 
mail area (so you don't run into user quota problems).  However as soon 
as the user starts Pine these messages get moved into their home 
directory (and so get charged against their personal disk quota).  If 
there isn't enough disk quota an error message is displayed, and the new 
messages don't get shown (and so can't be read).

One gotcha is that the code as supplied in the mbox.c file requires the 
presence of a (possibly empty, if not must be validly formatted) file called 
"mbox" in the home directory for the mail moving to occur.  No doubt this 
can be easily changed along the lines of "If the file isn't there don't 
fail, just create one".

The advantage of this approach is that unseen and read messages are still 
rationalised into one folder (still called INBOX within Pine, but 
actually $HOME/mbox) rather than forcing the split into totally separate 
folders.  It also means that users can't get round it by overrinding the 
systemwide variable setting in their .pinerc file!

We're looking at trying this out on a few of our own Staff, but need to 
be sure it'll work before doing it to users.  ... It's a bit of a one-way 
street to go down!

Had the following query from a user here.  I'm sure I've seen discussion
of this on the list, but it doesn't seem to have been implemented.  Would
it be a good thing to add?  In summary: 

  User runs Pine, leaves the session going

  User goes away and logs in from somwhere else; Pine correctly takes
    the lock from the first session

  User comes back to the first session.  Would like a way to grab
    _back_ the lock.

Thanks,

  I.

When I dial-in to my workstaion & look at mail with Pine it is very good 
at grabbing the file locking, but when I get back to the console I have 
to quit Pine, then run it again to leave the read-only mode. Is there a 
way of getting the file lock back in Pine?

I'm sorry, but it is extremely unlikely that this would ever be 
implemented, due to internal technical considerations.

``Having the lock'' means ``I know exactly what the mailbox file looks
like on disk, including where all the messages are located, and the only
thing anyone else can do to this mailbox is append to it.'' Conversely,
``not having the lock'' means ``I took a snapshot of the mailbox file some
time in the past, but I have no idea what it might look like now, so I had
better not try to do anything with that file again.''

The upshot of all of this is that ``grabbing back the lock'' is a 
meaningless concept.  The process which lost the lock no longer knows 
what is on the disk; rather, it just has a snapshot.

Consequently, the only way to get the lock again is to close the mailbox 
(discarding the snapshot) and re-opening it again.  You can do that with 
the appropriate commands in Pine, or by exiting Pine and running it again.

We may, in a future version, create an automatic way to do this that 
would simulate the behavior you've requested (``grabbing back the lock'') 
but in reality it would be doing a close/re-open operation.  The issue 
becomes whether or or not it is worth adding yet another command to Pine 
to do an operation that users can already do themselves....  ;-)

Thanks for the reply..  Err.. I can see this should be obvious, but:  What
_are_ the `appropriate commands' in Pine, to do this??  Leaving and Going 
back to the INBOX again still seems to keep the cached snapshot...

The INBOX is the one folder that there is no way to recover without
exiting and re-entering pine.  This is a side effect of never closing the 
INBOX in routine operation.

Well I've been using 3.89 for a month or so now.  I think Ihave a couple 
of nice features that shouldn't be to hard to implement in the next version.

1) Have "Take address" take the To: address instead of the from address 
if you are in the sent-mail folder.  This is useful if you initiate 
contact and never receive a reply. Or if you didn't initially plan on 
including the person in your address book but change your mind.

2) On start-up pine should check the contents of all of your "incoming 
mail boxes"  so the display might look like this

INBOX            Pine-info          GIS-list      MOTO
5   msg.         16 msg.            200 msg.      2 msg.

or perhaps

INBOX [5]       Pine-info [16]      GIS-list [200]  MOTO [2]


BTW:  why does filter leave the original meg. in INBOX when I have it 
      parsed into a different folder?

Thanks,
Dan

We are attempting to install pine on a Data General Aviion 5500. Version 
3.89 was obtained via ftp on Thursday, January 27. Ralph Sims at Halcyon 
suggested sending a message to ask for assistance. The messages from the 
make process are attached.

We are running version 5.4.2 of DG-UX. The 'cc' compiler runs gcc with 
the -traditional flag set according to the man pages.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. If we are the first to use 
pine on a DG box we would be glad to share the recipe with world when we 
get it working.

Thanks!

Dan,

We are planning to extent the "Take address" command to look at more than 
just the From: header.  Our current internal developmental version of 
Pine has an experimental command to cycle through your incoming folders 
and count messages, but the performance of it is too bad to make it 
automatic yet...

Thanks for the suggestions!

--DLM

P.S.  The "filter" program from ELM has options to either leave a copy in
your inbox or not.  See the filter docs for more info.

We have a contributed DG/UX port of Pine 3.86 that we have not rolled into 
the distribution yet.  If you would like to take a look at it I can send 
a copy separately.

We've done this, and so far things look fine.  Its also helped out alot 
by reducing all the mail that normally gets left in the spool, which 
overflowed a while bnack, causing some chaos.

Hi.  this has probably been discussed before, but I was wondering how
user-contention locking works when the user's spool directory is
NFS-mounted.  Particularly, I have my spool directory NFS mounted to a
bunch of different machines.  Normally, If I open two pine sessions from
the same machine, the first session gets the lock taken away, and the
INBOX becomres Read Only.  I just noticed that if I start pine from
machine a, and while it is open, start a pine session from machine b (that
has the same spool dir), they both have Read/Write access to the inbox.
Am I doing something wrong?

Thanx.

Yes, you are doing something wrong, regrettably.  You are using NFS for 
remote mail access instead of IMAP.

We understand that NFS access of mail is popular at many sites, and we go 
to great lengths to try to make it work.  However, there are technical 
limitations which severely restrict our ability to do so.  We believe 
that Pine works as well over NFS as other UNIX mail tools; unfortunately, 
we are (at least for the time being) unable to make NFS access via Pine 
work at the same high standard we have for local access.

Pine's locking against multiple simultaneous read/write sessions only 
works with local files.  It does not work over NFS.  At best, Pine is 
reduced to the same level of interlocking as ordinary UNIX mail utilities 
have; however, note that in certain circumstances that translates into 
*no* locking at all.

Pine does try pretty hard to detect the situation in which locking has 
failed and another mailer has stepped on Pine.  Unless Pine is absolutely 
sure what it is doing is safe, it will decline to write to the mail file.

Careful now! Any folder (except INBOX) can contain messages received and  
messages sent; equally there is no such thing as "the sent-mail folder"; 
PINE  is configurable, and these things can be called what the user 
chooses. The right feature, which I would certainly like, is that the 
Take function takes the sender from received mail and the addressee from 
sent mail. 
A slightly more bells and whistles version would give a choice, but I 
would be happy with that simple upgrade.

It does not for me (using the elm filter); have you used the right primitive?

could it be implemented in PICO?

Would anyone who's got this combination working successfully be kind
enough to let us have copies of their config.sys/autoexec.bat (etc). We're
having problems getting this to work.

I've been using Pine for a while now after using Elm for many years. One 
feature of Elm that I miss is being able to have sent mail saved by 
username. I haven't seen anything in the Pine docs that mentioned being 
able to do this (though it's certainly possible that I missed it). Can 
this be done currently? If not, is a possible additional feature for some 
future version?

Jeff,

No, we do not currently have an FCC-folder-name-rule, but it is on the 
list for a future release.

Thanks for the suggestion!

 Hi all,
	I am configuring my environment from Printer Setup, in the option 
<3> called "Personally selected print command" I put my printer program 
called "hello" (for example)..
	"hello" can work as :

	%hello <file name> <enter>
         if $1 exist then		# $1 == file name
           print

		or

	%hello <enter>
	 File Name : <file name> <enter>   #read variable...
         if file exist then
           print

	PINE not put the message into an file.... then what can I do for 
print my messages from "hello" program...??? I can do it??
	I am working on PINE 3.87...

	Thank's in advance...

FYI, we've been running using the MBOX driver (moves the mail from
/var/spool/mail to a file named mbox in the user's home directory) for
about 1.5 years (back to Summer 92) on about 100-300 accounts.  We've had
no problems over the time. 

To address the problem that there needs to be an MBOX file in the home 
directory, we create one when we create the user's account.

Isaias,

Try "| cat > /tmp/prtfile ; hello /tmp/prtfile ; rm /tmp/prtfile".  It's a
bit long, but it should work.

I like to do this, too, and do it by periodically redistributing sent-mail
using an alternative .pinerc with a different saved-msg-name-rule. It's
a bit tedious, and means that mail to/from a user ends up in a jumbled
order in a folder. I thought having a sort order by Date rather than 
Arrival would deal with that conveniently.

Since I don't archive all outgoing mail, it's probably better to be able 
to re-distribute it from sent-mail than to re-distribute it as it goes 
out, but it would be handy if I could change the saved-msg-name-rule
at run time, or have a rule to save by-correspondent, i.e. by-sender on 
received mail and by-from on sent mail.

Our HP 9000 Series 827 running hpux 9.0 had its /users file system
recently fill up because of the creation of a single huge .pine-debug
file.  The file was lost in the recovery process, but upon running a
search for other such files I noticed another 10 MB .pine-debug. (Nb. we
haven't set quota's on student directories.) I have just the tail from
this last file...should it be of interest.  I've not had any other
problems but wondered whether this is a known problem. 

If this is the wrong place to post such messages please let me know...

Dan
