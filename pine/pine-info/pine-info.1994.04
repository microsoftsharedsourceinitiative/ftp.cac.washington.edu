I do not have access to any MMDF systems and have had to guess what works and
what does not work from contributed code.  My surmise is that some MMDF
systems write a standard UNIX mbox format ``From '' line after the CTRL/A's,
and others do not.

c-client parses a message's ``fast internal date'' from the ``From '' line.
If it is not there, then there is no way to get a ``fast'' internal date.  I
guess it's perhaps alright to get it to the current date; it may cause false
date displays in some programs that use c-client but it can't be helped.  Pine
should be OK though.

Since I don't have access to any MMDF systems, nor have I ever gotten a
straight story on how MMDF works, there isn't much more I can add; you'll
probably have to do some hacking.  Let me know if there is anything I can do
to help out.

No, there should be no problem with having both drivers included, since only
the bezerk driver includes bezerk.h and only the mmdf driver includes mmdf.h.
The mmdf driver derived from the bezerk driver (if you do a diff you'll see
that they are quite similar), hence the similarity in names.

Hello, all-

Here I am with yet another pine/imap question: 

How do I save mail messages from my remote inbox to a remote mail folder? 
I don't want to save to my local mail folders always...

The on line help doesn't seem to talk much about different ways to save
things other than to mention export can be used to save to one's home
directory with little mail/header information; I don't believe that's what
I want. 

Pointers?

Thanks!

Hi,
	I have a user that wants to view attachments automatically instead 
of going through (what he terms) 'the tedious process' of V)iewing things.
	Is there a .pinerc configuration variable of some sort?

Eugene,

I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish, but Pine 3.90 will include a
couple features that might help.  The Pipe command will allow you to route a
message or MIME part through a program of your choice.  Mailcap will also be
supported, so you can define whatever viewers or filters you want.  There are
some limitations in the mailcap support, so we will be interested to get some
feedback from active mailcap users. 

Thanks for the request!

Hussain,

We plan to improve the attachment viewer interface in a future release of 
Pine.  Until then, I don't have too much to offer.  Sorry.

Thanks for the request!

Darci,

If the remote folder is in your primary folder collection, just give the 
folder name with the Save command.  If it is in another collection listed 
on the folder-collections variable in your .pinerc file, you can change 
collections using ^N and ^P at the Save prompt.  Otherwise, you can 
specify the full remote name as "{imapserver}folderpath".

Thanks for the request!

Kari,

This is definitely on the to-do list, but I am not sure if it will make 
the next release.  Thanks for the suggestion!

Matt,

As you have noted, Pine currently has a wee bit of trouble handling 
hidden directories in the browser.  We have not yet come up with a 
solution we are completely happy with, but it is on our to-do list...

Thanks for the report!

Subject: Port of Pine 3.89 to BSDI BSD/386 ver 1.1
To: pine-info@cac.washington.edu
Organisation: Swinburne University of Technology, Center for Applied Neurosciences
X-Mailer: Sendmail/Ream v4.16c

I have successfully ported pine-3.89 to run under BSDI BSD/386 version 1.1
and append the patches in the form of context diffs with respect to the
distribution tree from ftp.cac.washington.edu:/mail/pine3.89.tar.Z

These patches are based on the distributed "bsi" port to BSD/386 Gamma 4.1
as submitted to washington by Michael F. Santangelo <mike@cblcbos1.umd.edu>,
and the patches to pine3.87 posted to comp.os.386bsd.apps on Oct 31 1993
by Alex Tang <altitude@css.itd.umich.edu>

Get and untar the distribution tar file, run these patches out of the pine3.89
directory, then do "build bsi"  (then copy the binaries to somewhere like
/usr/local/bin).

It would be nice if these patches replaced those based on the obsolete
BSD/386 Gamma release in the canonical Pine distribution...

Alex.

Greetings:-

I have started playing around with SLIP recently, and was hoping to get
PC-Pine (pcpine_p) running. I am using the SLIP8250 packet driver, and
have successfully got SLIP'ping with Kermit, Gopher and NCSA Telnet. 

Although I've made the necessary mods to the wattcp.cfg, and even tried 
the NCSA config.tel file, my primary problem seems to be that machine 
names are not being resolved by the nameserver. For example, all attempts 
to open an inbox on some remote machine, come back with a host unknown 
error message. 

I'd appreciate any pointers :-)

Ian.


P.S. I also assume that the PC version of the IMAP executable is included
as a part of PC-Pine, as I was unable to find anything of this sort
separately.  I should also point out that telnet'ing to various IMAP
servers, has verified that this new service works.

Robert,

The simplest way is to set "last-time-prune-questioned=99.12" in your 
.pinerc file.  This will delay the move for a few years anyway...

Thanks for the request!

While it doesn't really turn it off, what works is to change
the "last time pruned" in .pinerc to something like 394.
Then it just never occurs.

Sorry if this is too basic of a question for this list. How do I change
the current wordwrap in Pine? I would like to change it to 60 or even 55.
Should this be included in the .pinerc file? thank you.

Terri,

There have been several requests for a word-wrap-column variable in the 
.pinerc file.  Thanks for the suggestion!

Hello,

  I am running Pine 3.89 on a SunOS 4.1.3 Sparc 10/41.  For some reason,
all of my users who have the filesize limit set began to get the message

sh: nnnn Exceeded file size limit

when they were sending mail.  They are able to create files with pico and
save them, so I think the problem is between pine and sendmail.  Has anyone
else seen this type of problem?  If this is a known problem, what is the fix?

Jim Ennis

Hi,
 Our college has recently acquired a box running on SCO-UNIX and I was 
wondering if we could find a binary version of Pine to run on our 
machine. What are the other requirements as far as files, pathnames, etc? 
We would be extremely grateful if someone could throw some light on the 
situation.

 Thanks in advance,

Chris Fullinfaw

Chris,

I understand there is an SCO port of pine on soils.agron.iastate.edu.  It 
is not part of the official distribution and I have heard mixed reviews 
about it, so let us know how you fare...

Thanks for the request!

Frank,

Here's the scoop from the expert (mrc@cac.washington.edu):

1) create a file /etc/anonymous.newsgroups
2) the file(s) to be read must be either netnews newsgroups (with setup on
   /usr/spool/news and /usr/lib/news/active) or in ~ftp.

Thanks for the request!

	I have a silly question.  Is there a way to make pine play a 
different beep sound than just the standard one when a new message 
arrives?  We're using NeXT machines running NeXTstep 3.0.

	Any ideas?

Hussain,

The only thing Pine currently does for a beep is send a ^G.  At some 
point we might change this, but I'm not sure how soon.

Thanks for the request!

How can I make the Rich Header option standard instead of having to press

Has anybody managed to build pine for solaris 2.3?  Pico builds nicely
(and works!) with "build sol", but I can't even get the addrbook.c module
of pine to compile.  What I get is error messages like this: 

Making Pine.
cc -DSV4   -g -DDEBUG  -c  addrbook.c
"/usr/include/unistd.h", line 171: identifier redeclared: rename
"addrbook.c", line 200: warning: semantics of ">" change in ANSI C; use 
explicit cast
"addrbook.c", line 204: warning: semantics of ">" change in ANSI C; use 
explicit cast
"addrbook.c", line 1349: cannot recover from previous errors
cc: acomp failed for addrbook.c
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `addrbook.o'

By editing the pine include files (I seem to recall that I removed an
"#include <unistd.h>" somewhere) I managed to get a successful compile,
but the resulting binary just coredumps while reading or writing the 
.pinerc file.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time to reseach this 
properly, so I'm asking for help.

BTW, this is with the SparcWorks C compiler.

	The problem is both stdio.h and unistd.h declare rename. The way
	around it is as follows:

	In stdio.h do 

	#ifndef _UNISTD_H
	extern int      rename(const char *, const char *);
	#endif

	In unistd.h do
	#ifndef _STDIO_H
	extern int      rename(const char *, const char *);
	#endif

	And you should have no problems after that. Happy pine'ing

Add -Dconst= to the CFLAGS for makefile.sol in the pine subdirectory.
That takes care of the redefinition of rename, and it is easier to do 
than adding #ifdefs and such.

Hi all
I'm not sure if this is the correct place for this message so I'm sorry
in advance.

I'm new at using pine so I'm not sure if this is possible.

I'm a member of four mailing lists and I would like the different
mailing lists to be put in different folders on arival.
eg, all the thinkpad email to go to the thinkpad folder and all the
guispeak email to go to the guispeak folder.

Is this possible?  How would I go about setting it up.  I've created
folders for each mailing list but the auto diversion?

Thanks for any help in advance.

Regards Nick

Hello,
	I was unable to compile pine on Esix SVR4, but someone gave me an
executable that does run, however it will not send mail.  Our system is
not running sendmail.  We are using smtp.  In the .pinerc file there is a
line for smtp server, but when I put our host there it doesn't work.  Now
for the questions:  What am I doing wrong?  Does anyone use pine on Esix
SVR4?  What am I doing wrong with the smtp server line in the .pinerc, or
do I have to do something on my system to make it work?  And for the final
question, does anyone have Esyx SVR4.0.4 with pine running correctally?

Thanks much,
Rick Gaine

If you feel like dealing with a little complexity, you can use procmail 
to do this (I assume it will run on a Next).  For example, the 
.procmailrc command:

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lets play a sound file for each incoming message and continue processing
# Will have to throw away the piped data and then execute the play program
# Will just send the header to pipe as smaller.  Wish could turn it off!
:0 hc
 |cat > /dev/null ; /usr/local/audio/play /usr/local/audio/MeepMeep.au

Does what you want for me.  Of course, procmail lets you do a lot more 
with incoming mail.  I have attached two readme files on procmail if you 
are interseted.

Hello,
	I had trouble compiling pine for NetBSD, so I ftp'd the binary,
however when I execute the file I get the following error:

    Who are you? (Unable to look up login name)

	Does anyone know what this means and how I can correct the problem?

	Or -  Does anyone hav the binary for NetBSD that works properly?

   We are considering a move to PC-pine.  In testing it, I tried to move 
my current folders from the Unix box to my PC.  They are in my \mail 
directory on my pc and they all have the .mtx extension.  However, when I 
use PC-pine, only folders created by PC-pine can be read.  Is there any 
way to "convert" folders from Unix pine to PC-pine?

Hi,

  I obtained a copy of the pine binary for SCO-UNIX from 
soils.agron.iastate.edu. I then tried running it on our machine and got 
as far as the pine main menu when the core dumps and I get the message:

  "Bug in pine detected: Received abort signal"
  "Exiting pine"

  Any help in porting pine to our machine would be greatly appreciated.

  Also, forgive me for asking, but what are the files I need for setting 
up pine for our system? I first used pine less than a month ago and like 
it immensely. I am now trying to see if I can port it onto our new system 
- a box running on SCO-UNIX V386/r 3.2, but know nothing about setting up 
the system. 

 Thanks in advance,

Lisa,
There is a conversion utility in development, but it is not quite ready for 
release yet.

Ippokratis,

Currently you can't, but the next release of Pine will let you configure 
what headers you get by default.

Thanks for the request!

Nick,

This is a frequently asked question, but unfortunately outside of the 
scope of Pine.  What you need is one of the freely available "filter" 
programs.  Some examples are filter, procmail, and deliver.  Ask your 
local support staff if any of them are already supported at your site.

Thanks for the request!

Kari,

Start with the original distribution and add "-Dconst=" to the CFLAGS setting
in the pine/makefile.sol.  That seems to take care of the problem. 

Thanks for the report!

Lisa,

No, we have not found a PC spell-checker that could be sandwiched into 
Pine without more hacking that we have been prepared to do thus far.

Thanks for the request!

We don't yet have any direct experience with the SCO port or Pine.  I have
talked to several people who run it without difficulty, others can't get it
to work... 

There are only two configuration files for Pine, /usr/local/lib/pine.conf 
and each user's .pinerc file.  You can generate a default .pinerc file 
with "pine -conf > pine.conf" and Pine automatically creates the .pinerc 
file the first time it is run.  Both files have comments explaining each 
variable.  If you have specific questions, let us know!

Thanks for the request!

Hi.  I don't know if this is acceptable to you, but I have a set of diffs
that you can apply to the pine3.89 source so that it will compile straight
(and work too).  They're located at 

	ftp.snre.umich.edu:/pub/pine/pine3.89.NetBSD.diff

Let me know if you have any problems.

To: Pine Info List <pine-info@cac.washington.edu>


Hello,

  I am running Pine 3.89 on a SunOS 4.1.3 Sparc 10/41.  For some reason,
all of my users who have the filesize limit set began to get the message

sh: nnnn Exceeded file size limit

when they were sending mail.  They are able to create files with pico and
save them, so I think the problem is between pine and sendmail.  Has anyone
else seen this type of problem?  If this is a known problem, what is the fix?

Jim Ennis

Can you tell me what kind of errors your getting?  
Which version of NetBSD are you running?  Which version of pine are you
trying to compile?

What is the best way to transfer text files to and from an IBM-comp. PC 
to PINE?


Is there a way to have more than one address book?

Is there another help manual or document for PINE?

Is there a way to export and archive an entire folder from PINE or do you 
have to do it message by message?

How can you tell when space is a problem, before it happens?


Thanks in Advance,

Speaking of headers.

It is now very difficult to save FULL headers to a file.  I had to deal 
with some spoofed mail and other idiotcies.  The only way to fully use 
the full headers was to save the message to a folder, and then read that 
folder in as a file.

I'd like, if possible, to be able to export full headers to a file if I 
am currently viewing them.

Thanks :-)

BTW:  A general thanks tl all of you for doing such great work.

	As postmaster here it would be *really* useful if people could
	forward me a message with full headers (Getting them to export
	it to a file then reading in would be ok though)

	Another vote for being able to save full headers - somehow!

	Thanks

Greetings:

  This is undoubtedly one of the most mail provoking lists I am on.  
Protocol on other lists state that questions are posted to the list, 
answers are replied to via E-Mail to the author (*not* the list) and then 
the person who posted the question posted a summary to the list.  Do you 
think this would be feasable for the PINE list?

<Please excuse my blatency after having been on the list for but a day or 
two ... does the load usually subside and this is just a high-traffic 
time or what?>

Enhancement:
 When in the "Index" mode ... would it be possible to jump to specific 
message numbers by simply typing the number rather than using the 
arrow-keys?  This is a slow method when our users are using the dial in 
lines at 2400 baud (like myself.)  I didn't notice an obvious way to do 
this in the .pinerc file.

Thanks,

Hello,
	I have a binary for SCO that works on Esix, but it won't send
mail.  I tried putting an smtp server in the .pinerc file, but it also
gave me an error.  Our crappy operating system doesn't use sendmail, so I
thought an smtp server would work.  How do I set up an smtp server?  Do I
need to do anything special to either the pinerc or my system to have it
act an an smtp server?  I really like pine and it is annoying not being
able to use it on my local system.   Please help...

Rick Gaine

Chris,

Pine-info tends to operate in more of a discussion mode than a gather and 
summarize mode.  Posting teh reply to the list can also reduce the number 
of duplicate responses you recieve as well.  The general volume of the 
pine-info list is getting pretty high.  There was some discussion about 
setting up a comp.mail.pine list a few weeks ago, but I have not been 
reading news.groups to see if anyone is following through...

You can jump by typing the number if you have enable-jump-shortcut on the
feature-list in your .pinerc file. 

Thanks for the comment and question!

I'd say the load is high today, sometimes I don't get anything.

There is a feature called "enable-jump-shortcut" which will allow you to 
jump to a message by just typing the number (and pressing Enter).  Add 
this to your "feature-list=" line.

It looks like pilot.njin.net is handling mail OK for you, so try setting 

	smtp-server=pilot.njin.net

in your .pinerc file.  If that does not work, run Pine with the "-d9" 
command line option, try to send, exit pine, then send a copy of the
.pine-debug1 file with a recap of the problem to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu. 

Thanks for the report!

Jim,

Pine does save the message to a temp file which is then passed to 
sendmail.  Is it possible that the total size of the message is exceeding 
the limit?  If you set the smtp-server in your .pinerc file, does that 
get rid of the problem?

Thanks for the report!

I feel that it is a good thing that the mail goes out to the list as well
as the original author.  This gives everyone a chance to read more about
pine and problems they may or may not have in the future.  I feel that the
list is funning just fine.

pilot.njin.net is not the system I am trying to run pine on.  I have pine
running on pilot.  It is our local system which is an Esix box running
Esix SVR4.0.4.

Actually no. Most of the time subscribers to this list are *discussing*
possible enhancements to pine, or *arguing* on optimum ways to use or
configure Pine on various platforms. So the original poster collecting a
summary of responses will not work since there will be no two way
discussion involved. 

Also, I wonder how many "original posters" would actually compile a 
collection of responses and repost to the list. I agree that a lot of us 
would, but then again maybe not. 

Omi Chandiramani, happy with the ^^, ^M, ^K sequence but could be happier.

Thanks for all the suggestions.  I finally managed to get pine compiled 
(I decided to add the #ifndef's to unistd.h and stdio.h).  However, I 
noticed something strange: if the global pine.conf file contains either
the last-time-prune-questioned or the last-version-used entry, the 
solaris version of pine receives a SIGSEGV and dumps core.

I know that the global configuration file probably shouldn't contain 
either of these entries, but our SunOS 4.1.3 binaries work perfectly even 
if the entries are there (the same binary runs OK even on Solaris 2.3 in 
binary compability mode).  It's just the "pure" solaris binary that has 
this problem.  Weird...

Hi, everyone!
	
	I just stumbled across mm2.7 on wuarchive and was wondering if 
anyone out there could share any hints to compile/configure metamail/MIME 
to work with pine and our system: NeXTstep 3.0
	
	Thanks!

Hi!
	I was wondering if there was a field (or will be a field) in the 
.pinerc which specifies a file listing addresses of people whom you DO 
NOT want mail from? Sort of a 'call-blocker' for email, if you will?

	If this is not a native pine function, is there a script for one of 
those mail filters?

	Sincerely,

	Hussain

I noticed someone mentioned mm recently on this list.  I know you pine 
folks have lots to work on, but I've had more than a few users asks for 
better search capabilities, and other mm like features.  

I guess what I'm really asking for is all of the capabilities of pine 
including imapd (I'm sold on it)  + some of the mm capabilities -- when 
you guys get around to it

Paul,

We're working on it!  What specifically do you most need from MM?

Hussain,

It is pretty easy to discard undesired mail with any of the mail filters. 
Here is a sample line for the "filter" program (from my .filter-rules file): 

	if (to contains "postmaster" and subject contains "Deferred") then delete

You could also have it execute a script to send a bounce message back to 
the sender.  The other filter programs have comparable features.

Thanks for the request!

When using procmail, add the following to your .procmailrc file:

:0
* ^From.undesired-sender@domain.net
roundfile

Or, you could replace 'roundfile' with /dev/null to really can the email.

Sure, in procmail it's as simple as this:

	:0hW
	| fgrep -s -f killfile

If you use deliver, this is a sample .deliver file:
    user="$1"
    FROM=`header -f from $HEADER | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`
    case "$FROM" in
	*user.to.ignore*) echo DROP; exit 0;;
    esac
    echo "$user"

Hi,
	What kind of mail filters are you talking about?  Where can I get
a mail filter from?

Thanks much,

The three addition's I'd like to see in pine are as follows:

The ability to add additional header lines in when sending mail.

The ability to change your default editor and use it for the headers and 
everything.

Built-in pgp support,

I'm sure these aren't as popular as other things, but I thought I'd put 
in my two cents worth.

In the Main Menu Help, section 6 (of the Table of contents) mentions that
 
	"Pine can usually recognize when it is being used over a low speed
	dialup line via a modem.  In this case it will show the current
	message in the index with a '->' instead of showing it all in
	reverse video." 

This does not seem to work here, and our best guess at this time is that 
we dial into (Xyplex) terminal servers, and the terminal server then 
connects to the unix machine via ethernet (which is NOT low speed).

Does anyone have anything to add to this, or is our guess the correct one?

Thanks,

Andrew,

The next release of Pine will allow you to configure additional headers 
in your .pinerc file.  

Allowing the alternate-editor to manipulate the headers is a tough problem
that we are deferring for now.  We are improving the way editing the body is
handled though. 

There are some legal and political roadblocks to be passed before we would be
comfortable adding PGP support.  

Thanks for the suggestions!

Thomas,

I believe your guess is the correct one.  You should be able to execute "stty
1200" or some such before entering Pine to get the low-speed mode.  The next
release of Pine will also include an option to force Pine into low-speed
mode. 

Thanks for the request!

	Perhaps a future version of pine could have appropriate locations
for hooks to various privacy packages to be added by the installer (but
not provided in the distribution). Maybe user installable menu commands
(e.g., Sign Message (specify MIME part number), Encrypt MIME part) would
be possible for the hacker (site implementor?). This doesn't solve all the
legal or political roadblocks, but does put some distance from the problem
and gives some folks a solution.  The hooks don't have to be strictly for
PGP, any package would apply. (IMHO, ignorant as it is) -Andy

Hi

I use multiple incoming folders, (with delivery to them via procmail) and 
they are listed in my .pinerc

I find though, that they're displayed in alphabetical order.  While this 
may be neat and tidy, the high volume folders are at the end, meaning 
that I have to TAB through empty folders before reaching the ones I want.

Are there any plans to change this?

Regards,
Kevin

Yes, a great idea. Would love to be able to automatically insert a 
return-reciept-to: line. Many mailers out there can handle the request, 
and it would be nice to see this added to pine.

Kevin,

The next release of Pine will display the incoming folders in .pinerc 
order.

Thanks for the request!

Actually, can't just you use filter command and filter out the mail that you 
don't want to /dev/null.  In this situation, you aren't getting mail from 
anyone that you don't want to.  ;)

Andrew,

That approach is a possibility, but I think of it as hack to use as a 
last resort in case we get desparate.  That is unless someone comes up 
with a good generic API that everyone can use ;)

Thanks for the suggestion!

ya, I got the -conf outta the tech notes... it was buried!

anyway, I configure BBS systems... and they need to have the full
hostname while all the rest of my hosts have to have just the domain
name (or, if they have the local real host name, the reply system
better do mx lookups).

pine 3.89 is excellent... much better than 3.05

I also installed a new tin-- but now I see that pine can read news as
well.  I configure all my clients to do NNTP... so I am going to try
to figure out how to make pine do that.

EXCELLENT WORK PROGRAMMERS

Hi,
	As much as I like to watch and _sometimes_ participate in 
discussions on pine, I think there is a NEED for this list to be able to 
be distributed in digest format.... please?

	I'll assume that another 50% of pine-info subscribers would quote 
the above text and write "me too!" down the bottom :)

I'm new to this list so apologise if these questions have been asked and 
answered before!

1	Is it possible to delete multiple messages other than by expressly
	typing D at each one in the index or when actually reading a message?
2 	Is it possible to send a file to someone without actually
	needing to go into the pine interface?

I don't agree with you.
There is a lot of traffic, I know, but you and others should
probably try to get a mail filter program like procmail (which I use 
too), and seperate Pine-info mail from other mail. At least, that
is what I suspect to be the problem.

I won't.

How do you set up news in PC-pine ? Using the same syntax as on our unix 
machine keeps giving an error about a \NEWSRC file that couldn't be
created. As unix-pine works ok, i assume that our imapd is ok.

Some examples would be welcome.

I'm using OS/2 TCP/IP as a client to access to some remote TCP/IP host.
How to I print a mail to a locally attached printer (Lpt1) on my OS/2
workstations ?
Is there anything I have to customise on the host pine program or my OS/2
TCP/IP setup ?

Could someone pls advise me ?
Thanks in advance.

Hello,

I also would not like to get pine-info discussions in digest format only.
Perhaps it could be available in digest format additionally, but not as a
replacement.

Is there a command line option for pine that will forse the arrow rather
then the reverse video??

Hi,

 I've almost(?) got pine 3.89 to work on our system SCO-UNIX. The problem 
is I can't get it to understand somethings about our system. I've 
attached a debug file (.pine-debug1) that I obtained using "pine -d9". 
When I ran pine I got as far as the MAIN MENU of pine and then the system 
hangs after giving a "bad system call" message. Any ideas as to what I am 
doing wrong, or not doing ?

 BTW, bandit is not the system I am trying to set pine up on. I am 
setting it up quest which is another system at our college. Maybe quest 
needs something to be done on it before I try putting pine on. Will 
someone please try sending mail to me at "fullinc@quest.witcc.cc.ia.us" 
in addition to "fullinc@bandit.witcc.cc.ia.us". NOTE: bandit works just 
fine to get messages to me, but quest doesn't.

 Thanks in advance,

 Chris Fullinfaw

Hello,
	How do you set up news in general?  I realize that is a rather
broad question, but can someone give me a step by step instruction? 
Reading news through pine sure would be nice.

Thanks much,
Rick Gaine

Colette,

Unfortunately the answer is no to both of these questions.  (1) will be 
available in the next release though.

Thanks for the request!

Wim,

Did you copy your .newsrc file from your Unix account to \NEWSRC on your PC?

Hello,
	I am trying to get sendmail running on an Intel machine running
Esix SVR4.  I am having trouble with the sendmail.cf file.  Can someone
that has sendmail running properly on either an SCO or ESIX SVR4 box send
me a copy of your /etc/sendmail.cf file so I can use it as an example?

	Sorry that this question was not related to pine, but I thought
this would be the best place to pose the question.

Rick Gaine

No, i didn't. I just did so after your message and now it seems to work. 
But isn't there a way to use the remote .newsrc file instead of the local 
on the PC and update this one just as is done with unix-pine ?

I noticed that when I accidentally hit Ctrl-X Ctrl-S (a'la Emacs) trying
to save file, the whole thing gets hung and I usually end up having to
kill _both_ pico and shell processes. What can I do about it:  is it a bug
or is there something wrong with me?

I'll bet that the ^S is setting the scroll-lock.  The next time it
happens, type ^Q to turn it off.

Any chance we could see the c-client for winsock part of "WinPine" before
then?  I'd like to do some development with that (a mail filter, Graphical
client, etc).  Have you talked to the ECSmail folks to see if they'd be
willing to let you (i.e us) have that part of their code (since they based 
ECSmail on c-client, I believe)?

Don,

The latest IMAP toolkit includes a winsock port that should mostly work.  
It is in mail/imap-3.3.tar.Z on ftp.cac.washington.edu.  There are a 
couple small changes that have not been rolled in yet and it is still 
quite experimental, so let us know how it works for you!

Thanks for the request!

However...

Wim may be thinking about access to new via IMAP.

(Ultra-brief tutorial for news-impoverished Pine enthusiasts follows.)

Two ways to access news via Pine:

 1. Via NNTP.  Your newsrc file must be on the machine where Pine is running.
    pinerc entry:   news-collections=News *{news.wherever.edu/nntp}[*]

 2. Via IMAP.  Your newsrc file must be on the machine where news is stored.
    pinerc entry:   news-collections=News *{news.wherever.edu}[*]

The advantage of option #2 is that the same .newsrc can be used for both
Unix Pine and PC-Pine.  The disadvantage is that you must have an account
on the machine that stores the news and runs the NNTP server.

Caveats:

  Pine 3.89 doesn't know how to Post news
  Pine 3.89 doesn't know how to subscribe/unsubscribe 
    (the newsrc must already exist.)

  3.90 will have both posting and subscription

As David notes, a version *after* 3.90 will support "location
independence" of support files such as .newsrc, so that you can use the
same .newsrc from multiple platforms, even if you don't have an account on
the news server.

Is there any way to "paste" an address from the list into the text of a 
message?  Remembring the complete address while paging through the menus 
taxes my little grey cells....  especially when it is an arbitrary 
collection of characters :-)

I have finally been able to duplicate this behavior. Sometimes when exiting
I hit "q" and "w" about the same time. This is an operator error caused
by lazy fingers... 

This bug (?) only occurs if old-growth or quit-without-confirm is set
in .pinerc.

Putnam,

Hmmm...  you want to take an address from your addressbook and insert it 
into the body of a message?  Try this little procedure:

	1. Move the cursor to the CC line.

	2. Enter the nickname or press ^T to search the addressbook and 
	select the entry.

	3. Use ^K to delete that address from the CC line.

	4. Move the cursor where you want it in the body of the message.

	5. Press ^U to insert the address.

This is kind of a round-about way to get the job done, but it will work...

Thanks for the request!

Hi, everyone.

	We're still using 3.87 on a NeXTstep 3.0 (BSD) system (just in case you 
need to know) and I just discovered the /usr/local/lib/pine.conf 
(or .pinerc) read-message-folder option.

	My question is how can you be sure that the read messages are stored 
in the users home directory?
	When I tried it with this line:

	read-message-folder=~$USER/mail/read-messages       

	Which asks when you quit pine, 'save x messages in [wholepath]' --- 
sometimes the whole path is TOO LARGE for the screen and I thought people 
might get confused if they just saw: 
	'save x messages in /Students/c/ghchinoy/mai ?'

	Alternately, I tried this pine-conf line:

	read-message-folder=mail/read-messages       

	Which asks when you quit pine, 'save x messages in mail/read-messages ?'
	Does this mean that if you had changed your current working 
directory to something else, say /, before invoking pine you'd save all 
your messages to /mail/read-messages instead of the correct 
~user/mail/read-messages?

	I'm a bit confused about where this mail'd go.

	Thanks for any of your help,
	
	Hussain Chinoy

Hussain,

Pine *never* looks at the "current" directory.  There will be an option 
in Pine 3.90 that will allow it for export and read operations, but not 
for folders.

Thanks for the request!

Chris,

The .pine-debug1 file you attached was at the default debug level (2) and 
does not show anything out of the ordinary.  I have never seen the code 
for the SCO port that is floating around, so I don't know what it might 
be doing unusual.  Did it produce a "core" file when it crashed?  If so, 
do you have a symbolic debugger you can get a stack trace with?

Thanks for the report!

I know there is a flag you can give to cause pine not to generate the 
debug files, but is there a compilation time option you can set to 
prevent this?  

We've got tons of users wasting disk space generating debug files that 
will never get used.

	Two small comments...
	
	It would be nice to be able to execute pine in shell scripts (so 
I can automatically mail people files using my pine addressbook aliases, 
and including my .sig) with the command 'pine spod < file'. Can you add 
this to the infamous to-do list ? Puh-lease ?
	The second thing, could the aforementioned to-do list be posted to
the maillist at intervals ? This may stop the barrage of requests for the
same feature... 

	N.

Ryan,

You can turn off debugging completely by removing the DEBUG definition in the
makefiles.  Note that this will completely eliminate debugging...

Thanks for the request!

Norman,

"execute pine in shell scripts" is definitely on the long-list.  One of the
ways we determine the priority of items on the list is how often they are
mentioned.  If we posted the list, that feedback might not come in... 

Thanks for the suggestions!

Hussain,

The next release of Pine will contain a significant portion of metamail and
will run on NeXTstep.  Inquire on the info-mime@CS.UTK.EDU mailing list (aka
newsgroup comp.mail.mime) for more information on metamail itself. 

Thanks for the request!

I just tried using a remote directory for the postponed mail folder and 
Pine seemed to insist that this be a local directory. It'd be nice to 
have this available through IMAP just like the other mail folders.

Request:
	I finally got pine running on my Esix SVR4 machine.  Is it
possibal that the next release be portable to SVR4 easier then the past
releases have been?????  That would be such a big help.  It just isn't
fair to us pore soals that are stuck on SVR4.

How about it? This would be similar to the -z flag in elm. Right now I 
have a shell script which does the same but it would be much cooler to 
just have to type.. 

pine -x

or something similar. Anybody else support this idea?

Richard,

We are always interested in making Pine more portable.  Could you send us 
diffs of the changes you made to get it working on your system?

Thanks for the request!

Greetings:-

Although my efforts to get PC-Pine running via SLIP have been unsuccessful
to date, I have been using PC-Pine via PPP for a few days now. I think
it's pretty incredible that my very modest 286 equipped with a high-speed
modem, allows me to run the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) packet driver,
and thus become and Internet node and run PC-Pine! 

My only problem seems to be that I keep running out of memory on my 286! 
I assume that PC-Pine runs in conventional memory, and is thus limited by
the famous 640K MS-DOS barrier. I've killed all unecessary TSRs, but there
are still problems. In prticular, I've found that I can reply to a first
message, but that replying to a second one usually results in not enough 
memory errors. 

I would like to know how much memory PC-Pine requires, and if there are 
any other suggestions for reducing memory demands when PC-Pine is 
operating ...

Thx,

Ian.

And even if you don't have enable-jump-shortcut in the features list, you
can just type 'j' followed by the number, rather than use the arrow keys.

Two things I'd like to be able to do:

1.  Jump directly into the (and out of) the header area to make 
adjustments while composing text.  What I do now is page to the top and 
then use ^P.  I'd be happy to learn an easier way.

2.  Jump directly to the top (or bottom) of the text without repetitive 
use of ^Y or ^V.  That would help with wish #1, of course, but it would 
be useful for many other purposes.  Workarounds:  at the end, ^W for some 
arbitrary character likely to be in the first line (an "a").  Search 
wraps and deposits you there.  Or ^O to postpone and then C to resume, 
which also starts you over at the top.  Any way to get to the bottom?

Thank you considering these wishes.

I'm looking for a pine port for Solaris 2.x (2.3 is preferred).  I don't
have access to the motif libraries, so I can't compile it for myself.  (If
I remember correctly, you need motif to compile pine).

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Cory

Hi,
	What is this about needing motif to compile pine?  Is this true? 
I have never heard of this and I was just wondering.

Nope; not true.

(A Pine supporter at Nokia is working on a Motif version, but the 
"standard" Pine is a character-based application that does not use Motif.
Some of us run it from within xterm windows under the Motif Window 
Manager, but Pine itself knows nothing about GUIs.)

I'm not sure why Pine would require Motif as it is (at present at least) a
text-based mail user agent. 

I have built Pine successfully under Solaris 2.3 using the `Solaris 
port', i.e. 

	build sol

	First, you remember *incorrectly*.  You don't need motif or anything
else X to complie pine.

	Second, I've not tried it since I don't have Solaris, it has been
suggested that "Add -Dconst= to the CFLAGS for makefile.sol in the pine 
subdirectory."

Ian,

I run a waffle site, and memory errors can be a problem with that too.
There is a utility called shroom (SHROOM2D.ZIP I think) which writes out
the conventional memory to disk before spawning a new process, and reloads
it on the way back in. This may assist you, if PC-PINE does the same sort
of spawning - many such mailers do. Using shroom, you can get waffle to
run on an XT!

Cheers
John

Could you implement the following enhancements for the multiple mail folders:

 Notification when mail shows up in other folders
 
 Have TAB step through each new message instead of jumping immediately to 
 the next one

 Have TAB mark the messages it steps through as deleted, and have the user
 hit u for the messages they want to keep.  (This would help immensely for
 100 mesg/day mailing lists)

 Have TAB skip inboxes with no messages in them.

 Have Julia Roberts take some whipped cream and..  Whoops, wrong list.. =)

Or ... subscribe to mailing lists in a DIGEST FORMAT ... unlike this one!

She wouldn't have time to do anything with foodstuffs if she subscribed
to a mailing list that had lots and lots of messages per day and had no
DIGEST FORMAT subscription.

I've noticed similar with modems - the interface to the modem is probably 
running at a fixed high baud rate, even if the data rate is low.

Another way to set the '->' mode, or an option to set it as default may 
be a good thing.

You can probably fix this with the command "stty 1200" to tell the unix 
system you are at a low speed.  Since it communicates using TCP/IP (or 
whatever) it doesn't know the speed automatically.

There will be an option to force low speed behavior in the next version.

I recently used "Take Address" to add a name like "Thomas J. Watson, Jr." 
<TJW@misc.org> to my pine address book (without difficulty).

When I grabbed this address into the To: field while composing, pine split
the field into two "addresses" at the comma.  The mail showed up in my
inbox as "undeliverable" To: Thomas@isumataq.eskimo.com ('cause I didn't
pay attention to the brief <bell> that happened as I exited the To:
field and there's no local user here with the name "Thomas" -- if there 
were, he would of course have gotten a strange piece of mail and I might 
never have known something was amiss). 

After a while I sorted this out, and have now taken the comma out of the 
entry in the address book.  So there's no immediate need for help on this 
particular problem.  But the situation seems clumsy.  If commas are going 
to produce that sort of result, then there should be a more emphatic way 
of preventing them from being inadvertantly included within the ""s.

Is this a good algorithm? People on the list who have seen one thing
requested in the last X months, will they request it again?

I suspect the algorithm will make newcomer's wishes carry more weight
than they should.

I might be wrong.

(Just for the sake of it, I'll mention RFC 1522 again :-)

Hello!  How can one tell which newsgroups are available on a news host using 
Pine?  I don't think it has newsgroup subscription support yet.  Is the 
"Spring" version of Pine going to have subscription support?  What's the 
best workaround now?  Copy the entire list of newsgroups to each person's 
account?

Also, will the next version allow one to post an article to a newsgroup?  
Will that be through NNTP, through SMTP (e.g., ZMailer), or something else?

Many thanks.

I just returned from a long vacation and looks like there's a pile of
work waiting to be done...

The 'Pine Motif' program will be named SPRUCE to avoid confusion and
it will actually look quite different from PINE anyway. I will post
status reports of the SPRUCE project here and keep online documentation
in the World Wide Web. Look for this URL:

http://dshp02.trs.ntc.nokia.com:3000/Spruce/Spruce.html

The document is still under construction. It is formatted for Mosaic
and will include graphics eventually.

If you don't have a clue what is WWW and an URL, better find out soon... 

STATUS REPORT:

Before I left for vacation I was working on the message sending part
and should get message send to work within few hours of work as soon
as I can allocate those hours. This part has required a lot of work,
as I will have to do lot of changes.

Some additional code to allow addressbook updating and manipulating
folders and folder collections will bring SPRUCE up to PINE functionality. 

Then I need to add a simple on-line help and documentation. Then I think
it makes sense to release it. SPRUCE project runs at a low priority so
it is difficult to estimate a date. Before May, I hope??
Like all software projects, this one runs behind its schedule too...

Some people have already volunteered to test and possibly port SPRUCE
onto other platforms than my own HP730. More volunteers are welcome.

A binary executable for HP73x running HP/UX 9.01 is available for
evaluation.

   What is the statis of security on PC-pine.  In particular, is anything 
planned for development that will prevent a user from walking up to a PC, 
running PC-pine and sending mail as the user logged into the PC?  

   Or, what are other sites doing to help prevent or curb this possibility?

Thanks for all the responses.  Sorry for wasting your time.  I could have
sworn, though, that when I was reading the docs for pine a few months
back, I saw mention that it required Motif and that is why I laid off the
compile to do other things.  Obviously I remember incorrectly.

Thanks again,
Cory

Ian,

The minimum free memory for PC-Pine is about 500k.  Below that and you 
are pretty much out of luck.  More will be used if available (within the 
infamous 640k boundaries).  There are also memory fragmentation problems 
that will gradually eat away at the useable memory, so you may need to 
restart Pine periodically.  It should be able to handle more than one 
reply before running out though ;)

Thanks for the request!

Putnam,

In Pine 3.90, ^Y and ^V will take you into and out of the header, ^W^V 
will "search for end" and ^W^Y will "search for top".

Thanks for the suggestions!

We are trying to come up with a way to do this for the incoming-folders 
collection without being an inordinate resource hog.  There is a glimmer

Shahjehan,

The "spring" release of Pine will include subscription and posting via NNTP. 
Currently the best work-around is to use trn, tin, nn, etc for
subscription/posting.  

Thanks for the request!

Perhaps you could let the user specify which folders to monitor?  Since 
you've jumped to 3 minutes, this shouldn't suck too much time...

Have TAB function like the space bar, paging through the message, and 
jumping to the next unread one when it hits the end of the one its on.

Well, no. If one is dialing in on a modem which is locked to a high rate 
on the host computer interface end, the host *cannot* tell what speed the 
modems are running at, and "stty 1200" will block all communication.

So the coming option will be welcome.

Please oh please kill the delays between the messages!  It is 
particularly annoying when you switch folders, and have to wait 20 
seconds for the status messages to catch up so you can read the stuff in 
the box.

Also, switching folders via TAB is inconsistent... When switching from any 
folder other than INBOX to another folder (this time it could be INBOX), 
you are asked if you want to delete messages tagged for deletion.  
However, when you switch from INBOX to another folder, you are not asked, 
and deleted messages are not deleted.. could this be fixed?

Idea for the resource hogging inbox checking:  Put a flag in the system 
wide pine configuration so the sysadmins can determine whether they want 
the users to suck up time polling multiple inboxes...  Though isn't 
checking for new mail trivial, as all you have to do is keep track of the 
times (or sizes) on each one, and then checking the full box only when 
the size changes?

Right, but I think that a majority of dialin users nowdays come in 
through a terminal server which is then connected to the host through 
something like telnet or rlogin.  In that case, there is no "speed" of 
the telnet connection, so you can set it to whatever you want.  If your 
modem is hardwired to the host computer, you're stuck for now.  (And, of 
course, the option should be more convenient than typing stty commands, too.)

We *do* need to work on the message generation code.  Thanks for prodding us
to work on it ;)

This is because the INBOX is not closed when you leave it.  All other folders
are closed when you leave them for another folder.  Admittedly that technique
does lead to some consistency problems...

Currently, Pine does not have a mechanism to make that simple of a check. 
The current new-mail-check code actually parses the new messages which is
much more time consuming.  We have made a request for a fast-check c-client
routine, but I don't think it is ready yet....

For some reason, when I first subscribed to this list, and when I 
compiled pine on my system and first started to play with it, I got the 
understanding that pine did News stuff.  Don't remember exactly what it 
was that gave me that impression, but I do remember that people have 
talked a bit about it.  I can't seem to find any feature in pine 3.89 
which points toward an ability to read and post news.  Please let me know 
if this is a future enhancement, or if there's something I'm totally 
overlooking...

This is a great idea.  Then, also, if any of those hackers do come up 
with some good code that they would be willing to share, they could 
submit that to the pine crew as part of the next release.  That way, pine 
people don't have to do it all...

Bruce,

Pine 3.89 has very limited *read-only* news support.  You can eneble this by
setting the "news-collections" variable in your .pinerc file to point to your
news server.  You will also need a .newsrc file generated by some other
newsreader... 

Thanks for the request!

Bruce,

Unfortunately the contributed code has to get past the same roadblocks as any
code we would write.  We have already been offered a couple PGP patches for
Pine, but we cannot do anything with them until the legal dust settles :(

Thanks for the suggestion!

I was just talking to a colleague, and he said that his softball list has 
two modes.  1) Full mailings, 2) Collective mailings every 6 hours.  The 
collective mailings are done such thatk, every 6 hours a file has been 
kept of all mailers that came since that last collective posting, and 
then, after 6 hours, that file is mailed to everyone on the collective 
mailing list.  The list server is smart enough to be able to arrange 
that, at the beginning of the 6 hour mailer, an index of subject lines is 
found to be able to help you browse the file, instead of getting caught 
with this huge file that you feel you have to read every line of.

It's an idea...

I would not want you to close the inbox (and thus delete messages marked
for deletion) when you move to another folder from the inbox. I'm not sure
what you do with the inconsistent appearance to the user, but the current
behaviour is correct.  I often want to refer to a saved message in a
folder while I am going through my inbox and I may also want to go back
and refer to a messsage that I have marked for deletion. I want to mark
them for deletion when I read them but that doesn't mean that I am
completely through with them. A later message in a thread may prompt me to
go back and look again.

Sorry about my earlier message, but, after doing some more searching, I 
found I had not set my news-collections= option in my .pinerc.

So now I am running with both news and mail.  That's great.  Only one 
thing that could be a suggestion for pine 3.9.  If the listing of 
newsgroups could be made such that I could see a count of how many unread 
entries there were, I would feel a lot less anxious.  As it is, I 
subscribe to so many newsgroups that, if I cannot see that info in front 
of me, I will find myself reading every single group, not knowing whether 
I needed to.  I really don't have the time, with my job, to be bouncing 
around newsgroups.  Please consider this suggestion.  As a matter of 
fact, what would be cool is a menu option that allows flipping back and 
forth between a simple listing of newsgroups and a numbered listing.  
That option could be controlled by a .pinerc option which would turn it 
on or off, and by an option that, if this were switched on, would allow 
you to select which mode was to be the default every time you first get in...

How does one subscribe and unsubscribe in pine?  I have looked at the 
options available and have hit "?" to get the help screen.  The options 
and help seem very mail oriented and say nothing about news.  Even when 
you want to go to a group the option is called something like "go to
folder."  Please let me know if there is an option in my .pinerc that I 
am not activating or something...

Sorry to barge in but does Pine use the NNTP type of connection to read 
the news???

Thanks.

Sorry if I seem a pain, but I have one more suggestion for 3.90.  I 
really like pine, now that I am spending so much time on it, but there 
are a few obvious things that I thought I'd put in here as I came across 
them.  

I was just reading a mailer that had 3 attachments.  I hit "v" to view, then
"1" to see #1, and then "v" again(!!!!) to view it (again???).  Once 
there, I thought, OK, now I can just jump to the next attachment, but no 
such luck.

It would be great if there were an option in the viewer mode that allowed 
you to "go to next attachment".  That way you wouldn't have to exit 
viewer and then enter "v","2","v" again just to see the next one.

Oh, and, while I'm thinking here (a once a day activity), it would be 
great if, instead of v2s (to save the second attachment) why wouldn't 
pine want to know "v" that I want to view, and "2" that I want to go to 
attachment 2.  There is no reason to then have to enter the "s" or the "v".
Pine should just pop me into looking at attachment 2, and then while in 
viewer mode, I should have the option to save.  Seems it allows a 
slightly, though obviously, shorter route to getting into the viewer, and 
gives the option of saving at any time, and not just when you get into 
the viewer.  (Of course, this idea is being typed while I am in typing 
mode, so I'm not in Viewer mode, should this already prove to be an 
option inside the viewer.)...

I occasionally get uuencoded files in my mail.  How is it possible to 
save and uudecode a file without first extracting it?  Using extract and 
specifying "|uudecode" as a filename doesn't work... [possible enhancement?]

Then I'll mention this.  I use scripts a lot, and the ability to use pine
in a script would be great.  Hopefully it will not be too long in coming...

Subject: problem w/user-domain and smtp-server
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII
Content-Length: 1401

Hi.  First post here for me, so excuse the potentially rookie question.

I'm running pine on a Sun running Solaris 2.3.  In my .pinerc, I've
defined a user-domain that is different from the machine's hostname
(actually, what I've defined as the user-domain is a CNAME for the
hostname).  If I'm reading the docs right, this should be used for
the "right-hand part" of the From: and return-path addresses on
outgoing mail.  It isn't; all mail sent from pine goes out with
the regular hostname (and yes, I really do have a legitimate reason
for wanting to do this, if possible.  It's a long story) in the
from and return-path.

So, I thought to myself, it's probably sendmail re-writing all that
stuff, so I defined smtp-server in order to try to bypass the local
sendmail.  No luck; everything still has from and return-path pointing
at the local hostname, rather than the stuff in the personal config
file.  I *do* have the user-domain defined to be the hostname in the
system-wide file, but it's my understanding that the personal config
file takes precedence, right?

So, does anyone have any ideas how to get the outgoing mail to have
from and return addresses different than the default on a per-user
basis.  Thanks.

	I think the upcoming 'pipe' command feature will give you what 
you need (pine 3.90, I believe due sometime this spring, stay tuned).

	While a PGP specific patch may suffer from legal problems the original
request suggested a "generic" hook so that people could plug in their own
privacy package.  Do you see any problems with that approach?

Pierre,

Pine can use NNTP, IMAP, or local file access to read news.

Bruce,

We have a message-counting mechanism for the incoming-folder-collection
(which can include newsgroups) working in our experimental version, but we
are not really happy with it's performance.  This will be at most a special
command for the Pine 3.90 release.  We would like to have automatic counts,
but we need to improve the speed considerably first. 

As you have noticed, Pine 3.89 does not have support for subscription,
unsubscription, or posting news.  These *will* be in the Pine 3.90 release. 

Thanks for the requests!

Bruce,

We do plan to revamp the attachment interface in a future release of 
Pine.  It will probably not make it into 3.90, but it should come shortly 
thereafter.

Thanks for the request!

Larry,

The first thing to do is check your .pine-debug1 file to see what is 
getting picked up from each config file.  If that doesn't point out 
anything, send us a copy and we'll take a look...

Thanks for the request!

Chris,

The next release of Pine will include the Pipe command which will allow 
you to type "|uudecode"...

Thanks for the request!

I posted this a few days ago but got no response. Did this circulate to

How about it? This would be similar to the -z flag in elm. Right now I 
have a shell script which does the same but it would be much cooler to 
just have to type.. 

pine -x

or something similar. Anybody else support this idea?

In Pico, how do you jump to the end or the top of a file?
Being able to jump to a line number would be nice to.

Thanks.

PGP is using RSA protected by a US patent, therefore possibly breaking US 
patent laws. Also, PGP can not be exported outside US.
*BUT*, PGP is legally sold under the name ViaCrypt, under legal license 
terms. See alt.security.pgp .

Therefore, calling PGP from inside pine can not in my opinion break any law.
Inside US, it is a permitted when bought as ViaCrypt, and outside US there
is not any law against it.

I see the save command (when viewing a message) lets me save to a file
named *.  One of our users did this by accident, and decided to fix it
afterwards by doing rm mail/*, and even though we have rm aliased to
rm -i, he told it OK to do it.

* is an unlikely filename to want; some other special characters would
also be "fun" for novices to handle in filenames.  Do you all feel like
imposing a character test for file creation?

I second Joe Brennan's thought.  My particular version was less dramatic.  
I created a file with a $ in its name, and found that unix has ideas 
about such files that DOS never dreamed.  After several discussions with 
others who were as baffled as I, a stranger who used unix all the time 
gave me the clues I needed to work with and then delete the file.

It would have been nice to have been saved from myself in this instance.  
Even more so if I'd strayed down the path Brennan's user followed!

There have been several messages on this topic recently; here's my $.02...

 o Support for private/authenticated mail is clearly important.
 o We do not expect to bundle encryption code in the Pine distribution.
 o We do not expect to purchase technology from ViaCrypt.
 o Additional alternatives will be coming from MIT "real soon now".
 o The suggestion that we provide hooks so that an *external* package
   can enhance/de-enhance a message seems exactly right to me.
 o In 3.90 "pipe to cmd" and "mailcap" support may provide part of the 
   answer (for processing incoming messages).
 o Feasibility of the "external processing" approach has yet to be verified.
 o Nothing has been done yet about hooks for outgoing msgs.  It's not
   likely that this will be done in time for 3.90, unless it turns out to
   be dead easy.

Hi there!
	
	This is sort of a unix question.  I've known for a long time that 
Pine can print to a printer using "attached to ansi," but what is the 
command to do that for a file from the unix prompt?

Please note, it is very easy to PGP-sign a pine mailing.

A) create a script outside of pine.  I call mine 'picopgp'.

====picopgp====

#!/bin/sh

pico -z -t $1
pgp -sat $1
mv $1.asc $1

====end========

B)  Set your alternate editor to this script (if in your path, just picopgp)

C)  When you want to pgp-sign your message, invoke your alternate editor 
and when you exit it, you will be asked for your password and then will 
have a signed message.

Hi, I've been hunting in the pinerc file and can't locate how to set this 
up. Is it possible to set up a From address in the pinerc of a user's 
account, so that when a message is sent from that account, the From line 
has a generic address (like pine-help@cac) rather than the person's 
address? If so, where do i set this up?

Hussain,

The Pine source distribution includes a small utility program called 
ansiprt that will do this in the contrib/utils directory.  Documentstion 
for the program is included in the source file.

Thanks for the request!

Is it possible to jump between mail and news without having to close one 
or the other out?  I would like to freely be reading or write my mail and 
just bounce over to news to see some information.  That is, actually, the 
only thing about seperate packages that I didn't think about before starting 
to use pine. You can go to news to cut something out with your mouse and 
go back to your mailer and paste it in.  May not seem like much, but, 
when you're in a mailer and want to refer to an article you can't get to 
it because you are tying up the package writing your mailer.  Hope I'm 
making sense here.  I guess what I mean is the ability to have either 1) 
multiple processes that you can switch back and forth between, or 2) temp 
files that keep the info from your mailer (such as where you were exactly 
and a copy of the mailer you were composing, with the cursor position) 
while you jump over to read news.  You might even use this as a way to be 
able to open a saved or unsaved mailer for reference while writing a 
mailer that is to be sent.  This would definitely increase functionality.

Please let me know if I'm going too far, but I'm interested to see if 
such a situation could be done without throwing the pine people into a 
major loop...

Well, the documentation doesn't really say how to use the command, or 
that the command line option, if present, tells whether to output a ctrl-d
after detecting the EOF on input.. or under what situations you might 
want to do that.  I simplified the program to the following, "ansiprint":

% more ansiprint.c

#include <stdio.h>

main (argc,argv)
char *argv[];
int argc;

{
        char c;

        putchar ('\033');
        putchar ('[');
        putchar ('5');
        putchar ('i');

        while ((c=getchar())!=EOF) putchar(c);
        putchar ('\f');

        putchar ('\033');
        putchar ('[');
        putchar ('4');
        putchar ('i');
}

I found that I had to add the \f (formfeed) at the end in order to force Mac
VersaTerm to print the unix file to attached imagewriter NOW..  otherwise
it just wanted to buffer it up and print when it had what it considered to be
a pagefull.  I found that ansiprt and pine's print had different results, so
I looked into pine's print routine to determine that the above did the trick. 

To use ansiprint:

	% ansiprint < myfile
or
	% cmd1 | cmd2 | ansiprint

ansiprint does not take a file name on the command line.  You must use 
indirection or put at the end of a pipeline.

Feel free to use.  No liabilities here.  :^)

Me neither - I have 2 requests:

1:	that Pine tell the user what the name of the encoding method for 
attachments is, so that the user can tell the would-be recipient (not using 
pine) how it is encoded. I'm not a completely dumb user (no arguments please 
;-) and I don't know off the top of my head, and when someone who knows more 
than I do asks, I feel a bit foolish saying I don't know!

BTW what IS the encoding method...?


2:	when a message is received with an attachment, pine asks if you want to 
save/view part 1 or 2 ... now I've been here before and know that part 1 is the 
plain text mail message you get to read anyway as soon as you go into the 
message, and there's already a command to save or export it, so what is the 
point of this - the part you want to save or view is always part 2 (or > 2 if 
there is >1 attachment), so why not have part 1 == 1st attachment ... etc ?

Sorry if this is the 17th time you see this question, but I'm dying to know 
if the "Spring" version of Pine will support multiple address books (e.g., a 
system one and a personal one).

Much obliged.

John,

The encoding method used for all attachments in Pine is called BASE64, but
most of the decoding software available for BASE64 can already figure that
out from the MIME headers... 

Pine and some other mailers use the _convention_ that the first part of a
multipart message is the text body, There is nothing in the MIME
specification that requires that convention, and there are mailers available
that do not use it.  There has been some discussion in the comp.mail.mime
newsgroup about ways to distinguish between attachments and message body
parts in MIME, but I don't think anything has been decided. 

Thanks for the request!

Cindy,

The next release of Pine will support both the Reply-To: header and a
pre-settable From: header.  We expect to have it available later this spring. 

Thanks for the request!

Shahjehan,

Sorry to disappoint you, but it does not look like multiple addressbook 
support will make the spring release.  It does remain high on our 
priority list for a future release though.

Thanks for the request!

Thanks John... The problem is that David inadvertently got a couple of 
extra words in his sentence.  It should have read:  "Documentation for 
the program *is* the source file." :)

(This is a Unix app, after all.)

John et al, 
It is both necessary and sufficient to have a "MIME capable" mailer or 
external software to read Pine attachments.  So it should be enough to 
say to your correspondents "You need MIME capability".  

For the terminally curious, Pine uses MIME's "Base64" Content-Transfer- 
Encoding for all attachments.

The attachment interface *is* due for an overhaul, but being removing 
the ability to specify the first MIME body part is not such a good idea,
for two reasons:

1. Using the attachment viewer's save option is currently the only way to 
   save a message without any headers.

2. Other mailers may generate "first" body parts that are not ascii text.
   In this case, it is important to be able to explicitly specify #1.

Still, we all agree that the current attachment interface is a bit clunky.

Ha Ha!  I followed that convention in my source code as well...

Whoever picks that program up would do well to incorporate my usage notes as
comments.  The program really should take a filename as an argument as well. 
See any C textbook for the solution.  :^)

You can run two copies of pine.  If your shell supports job control 
(assuming you're running UNIX Pine), and you've set feature-list=
enable-suspend, then you can switch between the two running copies.

The second copy opens in Read Only mode (so you can't delete stuff in 
your remote inbox).  Also, don't forget about the background job, or the 
IMAP connection will be broken.

This is admittedly pretty kludgy, but it would work.

If you are looking for something to do with it (pine people), you could 
probably integrate something like that into pine itself.  Have a .pinerc 
flag 'pgp-enable' and some perhaps a 'do you want to PGPSign this 
message' prompt.  Or perhaps control-E to exit construction of a message 
and sign it.

I'd think it would be very easy to do, won't require any integration of
PGP itself, and would be pretty intutive, I'd think.

Hello,

while configuring pine one problem occured with the setting 
folder-collections=Mail/[] in my pinerc. During startup pine gives the
message

"Creating subdirectory "/usr/people/thomas/mail" where pine will store
 its mail folders."

and actually creates this directory, although it will never use it (since 
there is this folder-collections entry, which directs all mail into ~./Mail).

Is there a problem with my configuration or is it just a bug in pine?

Thanks in advance,
Thomas Mueller

You also have to set mail-directory=Mail

Thanks David and Terry,

When I first came across a message with an attachment I was confused to find 
that asking to view attachment number 1 put me back into viewing the plain 
message. I was in naive user mode, and I am guessing that other naive users 
would find it similarly confusing (even with the attachment view/save interface 
cleaned up).

I do think attachment number 1 should be the first actual attachment - if (as 
Terry suggests) it is necessary or desirable to be able to invoke the 
attachment view/save mechanism for the body, couldn't this be referred to as 
part 0 ?? That way the smart users would be able to do what they want, and the 
naive users would get what they expect when they do what comes naturally - 
which is the pine philosophy, n'est ce pas?

BTW Terry, I don't understand your second point - I thought email message 
bodies were exclusively ascii text (give or take some differences in national 
character sets) - isn't this what attachments are all about? Surely if anyone 
produces a mailer that sends out first body parts that are not ascii, 99.99% of 
other mailers won't be able to read it without fiddling about, and it isn't 
going to be very popular?

Does that really apply if the contributed code is just a patch which 
allows an external program called 'pgp' to be called? Or a program which 
is called 'tom', maybe, which just might happen to be 'pgp'? How could 
there be any legal problem with that?

There is just such a patch floating around. And there seems to be 
considerable demand.

Pine Team,

I'd just like to make sure that one of the things on your to-do list is to
allow other messages to be included (in the manner of a reply) when 
composing or replying. This is about the only thing that I regularly have 
to go outside of Pine to do.

Is it applicable to the DOS pine or only the Unix version?

I know the DOS version is usually distributed as an executable, but I 
understand the source is available...?

John,

   I have a small program which does the same as your ansiprint.  
However, my program, as well as yours, do not take into account the time 
it takes for the printer to do a formfeed at the end of the page.  I am 
looking for a way to do that so printouts from unix to the ansi printer 
do not lose 3 lines between every page.

Your point is well taken.  Hopefully we can clear it up with the redesign.

Actually, Pine doesn't make it available, but I believe the underlying 
c-client code calls the message headers part 0.

Attachments are a Pine concept, not a MIME concept.  To be minimally
conformant to the MIME specification, a mailer must be able to handle *any*
mix of content-types in a reasonable fashion.  For example, I have heard of
sites experimenting with voice-mail via MIME, in which case there would be no
purpose in having anything but the audio/basic content.  Any MIME mailer
should be able to at least save it to a file...

We're happily using Pine as a newsreader (mostly 3.07, some 3.89). I'm
toying with the idea of setting up anonymous news access via Pine; how can
I do this so that the default folder colletion presented will be the
entire set of newsgroups in /usr/lib/news/active?

	inbox-path=*{newsserver/anonymous}[]		(anonymous IMAP)
or	inbox-path=*[]					(local news)
or	inbox-path=*{newsserver/nntp}[]			(nntp)

where newsserver is the hostname of the news server.  You will need to 
generate the .newsrc file externally, perhaps a shell/perl script that 
builds the file then invokes Pine.

Thanks for the request!

While reading USENET, I've seen articles with a Message-ID header with 
"pine" in it.  How do you post from pine?  (I do know how to read news
in Pine.)  My primary account has v3.87 installed and my other account 
has v3.89.  Thanks.

I have noticed that pine does not deal with cross-posted messages.  In 
rn, if you read something that was cross-posted to both alt.hari.krishna 
and alt.new.wave.toenails, you only have to read it from one newsgroup.  
If it is cross-posted to 5 newsgroups, again the news reader should be 
able to update my .newsrc file such that I would not have to read the 
same article in more than one group.  Is this change made in 3.90?

Also, will the 3.90 pine newsreader do threads?

Lisa, et. al,

how about adding:

	for (i=0; i<PADCOUNT; i++) putchar ('\0');

just after any formfeed sent to the printer -- this send some nulls out to
keep the serial/parallel port busy while the printer does the form feed. 
(The printer will just drop the nulls instead of good characters).

Here is a revised program.  Adjust PADCOUNT upwards till it works.
Let us know what value works for your printer & configuration.

#include <stdio.h>
#define PADCOUNT 10

main (argc,argv)
char *argv[];
int argc;

{
        char c;
	int i;

        putchar ('\033'); putchar ('['); putchar ('5'); putchar ('i');

        while ((c=getchar())!=EOF) {
		putchar(c);
		if (c=='\f') for (i=0; i<PADCOUNT; i++) putchar ('\0');
	}

        putchar ('\f');      for (i=0; i<PADCOUNT; i++) putchar ('\0');

        putchar ('\033'); putchar ('['); putchar ('4'); putchar ('i');

}

Matt,

There are a few of us on the Pine Development Team who have been using an 
experimental version of pine that supports posting.  Other than that you 
might be seeing some postings through an email-to-news gateway....

How do I customize the help menu in pine that directs people where/who to 
call for assistance? I have a mail account set up for pine related questions 
that I'd like to include in there. The system admin. that did it before 
has left us. Thanks in advance for the help.

Also, like the idea of including other massages al a ~m 2 into a new 
message. Hope it gets included soon.

Michael,

Pine will insert the contents of /usr/local/lib/pine.info, if it exists, 
into the "Local Contacts" portion of the help text.  You can also set the 
initial addressbook entries by setting the bugs-nickname, bugs-fullname, 
and bugs-address in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.

The next release of Pine will include support for replying to and
forwarding multiple messages.  A more generic inclusion capability will 
come later.

Thanks for the requests!

Do something like this:

   if char=^L then sleep(1) 

one second should be long enough, but it can always be lengthened.  Hell, 
you could put the sleep time as a command line option

Bruce,

Neither of these will make it into Pine 3.90.  We will keep them on the 
list for future releases though.

Thanks for the suggestions!

We are in the process of reorganizing some of our hard drives and would 
like to give everybody a message telling them where to post any troubles 
they may come across.  We have set up a message that runs before nn 
executes, and were wondering if a similar feature exists in Pine.  If 
not, perhaps this could be a future enhancement ... ?

(Just for reference, it's not really plausible to post everyone  a 
message becuase of the limitations on disk space, &c.)

^R wouldn't let me type in "/mnt/a:" - it baulked at the ":". That's a bug.

	I may be mis-understanding what you are after.  But, how about
doing the following:

1.	Rename pine to something else, e.g. "forest"

2.	Create a shell script called "pine" that echos the message you
	want to the person's screen and then calls "forest".

	(At this point I was going to insert a pun about the user not
being able to see the forest because of the tree.....but never mind.)

Go ahead and make your requests. The importance of a request is judged by 
the number of times it appears on this list. A debatable algorithm but 
thats how it works..

I'm new to this list, so I hope I not bringing up topics you've all seen 
a hundred times.  There's got to be a way to trap the Quit signal. KBLock 
is useless if it will defer to Quit.  I would consider losing the ability 
to "Emergency Exit" while the keyboard is locked a small price compared 
to having a insecure keyboard lock command that some might consider 
secure.  As Phil Zimmerman said in the PGP Documentation, wrongly used 
encryption is often less privacy protecting than not using encryption at 
all (actually, when he said it, it was good English, but you get the 
idea).  The same goes for the KBLock command.

Although it may be useful at other sites, we would be very unhappy if our
users have the ability to change the From: line.  I hope that, if this
facility is included, you will also allow for the person who is installing
Pine to disable the facility. 

If not, we will have to patch Pine 3.90 when we receive it in order to
disable the setting of the From: line.  If we don't do this, my guess we
would have lots of faked mail sent.

And hope no-one compiles it in their own directory?

I agree. We have a lot of aggravation with people using Eudora setting the 
From: field incorrectly. In fact its so much of a pain that we have a table in 
our MTA (smail) setup that looks for people who have an incorrect From: field 
and re-writes it for them (in those cases we throw away their Repy-To: field 
on the grounds that if they have messed around with From: then Reply-To: is 
also likely to be wrong!).

The only 2 MUAs that currently give us NO grief are pine and ECSmail so it 
would be a pity if there was no configuration switch to turn off such 
facilities.

This is especially important with PC-Pine that we use with students in 
unsupervised environments - we have already had instances with faked mail (in 
some cases obscene faked mail) from people doing a telnet to port 25 so I 
would hate to see life made easier for the little .....s

Laurie Cuthbert

	Please don't take that statement so literally.  I'm sure that the
priorities placed on enhancements are determined by more than the number
of requests.  Also, before you decide to ask for an enhancement...think
about it for a day or two.  Is it really something that would be wanted 
and needed by others?  One has to start being concerned about creaping
featurism.  Also, as more and more people start using pine you have to
starting thinking about how changes are going affect more and more people.

	I see the time coming where a "final" release of pine should occur.
It should be feature rich enough for the average email user to be happy
using it and as bug free as possible.  You will then have a mature product
that many people will be happy with and won't feel the need to keep current.
And think of all the fun you will have with the context to name the next
generation...

Recently I've read various postings to this list about what
pine should have, how it should work, and even how the pine
team should do their jobs.  Suggestions to the pine team for
various and sundry improvements can help hone the product for
everyone, including the University.

However, I think the various users of pine need to keep in mind
that the pine team has produced and is still working on a product
for the University of Washington and that it is a tribute to 
the University that this product is allowed to be used by anyone
for no cost.  There is a great benefit to the Internet community
to have projects like this going on.  The costs to the host
institution are not trivial; the overall benefits are tremendous.

I would like to request a configurable wastebasket option.
It would be nice if it worked like sent-mail where it is moved into 
individual monthly folders and optionally deleted.

HEAR!  HEAR!

I am the PINE Administrator here at McMaster now and relatively new to 
UNIX as well.  The support and info from the pine team has been 
invaluable to me in assisting me in installing the newer upgrades onto 
our 3 systems.

Perhaps I don't understand your question, but couldn't you do this with

read-message-folder=trash
feature-list=auto-move-read-msgs

in .pinerc?  It wouldn't do the monthly thing, but you could write a 
short script to do that in your .login file.

I haven't actually read the RFC, but it's my understanding that that's 
what the Sender header line is for -- anyway, anyone who wants to fake 
mail could just do it with an agent other than pine (eg binmail).

Might RSA's recent announcement (below) that their RIPEM/SIG digital
signature software is now free and exportable come in somewhere here, in
the area of support for such signatures in Pine?  I gather this is
possible because they got a "commodities jurisdiction" ruling that the
software falls under the Commerce Department's jurisdiction as opposed
to the State Department and thus allows it to be freely and legally
exported.

TWO UPDATES MAKE FOR DIGITAL SIGNATURES IN EMAIL
================================================

DIGITAL SIGNATURES
- ------------------
One of the real up-and-coming uses of encryption technology is for
applying digital ``signatures'' to various electronic documents. Such
signatures are not forgeable and guarantee that a document originates
with its author. If Dartmouth College had such a system in place
recently, a message impersonating a faculty member announcing the
cancellation of an exam might have been avoided. Digital signatures can
also be used to detect viruses before infected files execute.

Up to now, however, digitally signing documents has not been an easy
task. The first hurdle has been an inability to export the technology
overseas, making it virtually impossible to standardize on a signature
method. Secondly, it has been difficult to license the technology
patents involved.

The use of a freeware software utility called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
has caused some difficulties as well. Since PGP has already found its
way overseas and has gained some popularity, in particular because US
digital signature software has not been easily exportable. In the United
States, many organizations are reluctant to use PGP because of its
questionable patent status. In addition, its author, Phil Zimmermann, is
under investigation for possible export violations. These problems have
kept organizations from adopting PGP as a standard.

Two recent announcements have significantly changed things.

The first announcement is the release of two new versions of RIPEM, one
called RIPEM, the other called RIPEM/SIG. RIPEM is a free version of the
Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) standard implemented by Mark
Riordan of Michigan State University. RIPEM/SIG is a subset of RIPEM
that allows users to digitally sign their e-mail documents but does not
allow encryption or decryption.

What is significant about this announcement is that Riordan--in
cooperation with RSA Data Security, Inc--has received a ``commodities
jurisdiction'' ruling which allows free and legal export of
non-encrypting RIPEM/SIG outside of the US. This means both US and
overseas users can now standardize on a single set of software, instead
of only working with RIPEM inside the US and PGP outside.

This release also addresses some of the complaints of PGP users: both
RIPEM and RIPEM/SIG support a non-hierarchical trust model similar to
PGP, and for US users the non-exportable version of RIPEM provides full
triple-DES privacy. Even though the triple-DES RIPEM may not be
exportable, Riordan is working with authors of independently developed
PEM applications in other countries with the goal of 100%
interoperability in a version 2.0 of RIPEM. Until that time, since
RIPEM/SIG is free and exportable, users could send a non-US or Canadian
user both RIPEM/SIG and the message to be authenticated.

The second announcement is from RSA Data Security, Inc. for the 2.0
version of RSAREF. RSAREF is a source code cryptographic toolkit
designed specifically for writing PEM applications as well other
fundamental cryptographic and digital signature tools. In fact,
RIPEM is based on the RSAREF source code.

What is most significant about this new RSAREF is that RSA Data Security
has changed its license to make RSAREF much more accessible to both
corporations and commercial and non-commercial developers. Freeware
products (i.e., software where no fee other than media or bandwidth cost
is requested) can use the RSAREF toolkit provided that the public has
access to the product's source code.

Though a new license agreement has not been finalized, I've been told by
RSA that they will grant a royalty-free license for shareware products
for up to $10,000 worth of gross annual sales if the shareware source
code is available and the developers do not charge more than $50 a
copy.

Even if you are a commercial developer, I know from personal experience
that RSA can be quite reasonable about licensing. They want this base
level of technology adopted as widely as possible--just make RSA a
reasonable offer and I think they'll take it.

RIPEM and RIPEM/SIG are also beneficiaries of this new RSAREF license,
which means that US companies can have privacy and authentication free
of hassles from patent holders and export cops.


MORE ON RIPEM/SIG
- -----------------
The press release on RIPEM/SIG from Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>
is at:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/posting

If you are a US or Canadian citizen, you can request an account for
access to the full non-exportable RIPEM. Information on how to get
access is at:

        ftp://guest.mu5k2d55:@ripem.msu.edu//pub/crypt/GETTING_ACCESS

The binary files for the exportable RIPEM/SIG can be found in the
directory:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/

RSAREF/SIG Files available today are:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-68030-macintosh-commandline-1.2a.sit.hqx

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-80x86-dos-vanilla-1.2a.exe

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-hppa-hpux9.01-1.2a

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-ibm-rs6000-aix3.2-1.2a

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemsig/binaries/
        ripemsig-sparc-sunos4.1.1-1.2a

There does not seem to be separate documentation for RIPEM/SIG yet, so
I guess you have to use the documentation for RIPEM 1.2a:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripem.man
        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemusr.doc
        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/ripemusr.txt

A current list of RIPEM public keys is at:

        ftp://ripem.msu.edu/pub/crypt/ripem/pubkeys.txt

There is an electronic-mail users group list PEM-DEV for discussions
related to the development and deployment of Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
systems. Contributions to the list should be sent to
``pem-dev@tis.com''. Administrivia, e.g., additions to or deletions from
the list should be sent to ``pem-dev-request@tis.com''.

The Internet Multicasting Service <carl@radio.com> is now beginning to
stamp all of their text files with RSA/RIPEM digital signatures.  You
can find their public key through a finger request to town.hall.org. For
examples of stamped files, look at:

    ftp://town.hall.org/edgar/docs/


MORE ON RSAREF 2.0
- ------------------
Remember, even though you can use RSAREF to create exportable,
non-encryption based digital signature software, the source code to
RSAREF is not exportable itself, as it can do encryption. It is only
available to US and Canadian citizens.

The press release on RSAREF from Jim Bidzos <jim@chirality.rsa.com> is
at:

        ftp://rsa.com//pub/RIPEM_SIG_announce.txt

Information on what RSAREF is all about and what are the license terms
are located at:

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/info.reply
        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/license.txt

To get access to a time dependent directory (it changes every few
minutes) you will need to read the document:

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/README

If you agree to it's terms, take the directory mentioned there and
substitute it for the checksum in the directory ``U.S.-only 7c04e6''.

The compressed tar archive of RSAREF is at (remember to change the time
dependent directory!):

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/dist/U.S.-only-7c04e6/rsaref.tar.Z

The ZIP archive of RSAREF is at (remember to change the time dependent
directory!):

        ftp://rsa.com/rsaref/dist/U.S.-only-7c04e6/rsaref.zip

You can also get the RSAREF via email by reading the RSAREF license
agreement and sending the following message to
<rsaref-administrator@rsa.com> (If your electronic mail address is
located in Canada, please also send RSA your full name and mailing
address; they'll need it to complete a Department of State export
declaration):

     I acknowledge that I have read the RSAREF Program License
     Agreement and understand and agree to be bound by its terms and
     conditions, including without limitation its restrictions on
     foreign reshipment of the Program and information related to the
     Program. The electronic mail address to which I am requesting
     that the program be transmitted is located in the United States
     of America or Canada and I am an United States citizen, a Canadian
     citizen, or a permanent resident of the United States. The RSAREF
     Program License Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement
     between RSA Laboratories and me relating to the Program, and
     supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and
     any other communications between RSA Laboratories and me relating
     to the Program.

RSA Laboratories maintains an electronic-mail users group
<rsaref-users@rsa.com> for discussions on RSAREF applications, bug
fixes, etc. To join the users group, send electronic mail to
<rsaref-users-request@rsa.com>.

Is there a way to specify a default audio device like there is to specify 
a default image viewer?  We often have people remotely logged in to other 
machines and it could be embarassing to go to read your mail message and 
then hear the sound of a toilet flushing on a computer in another room.  
(This happened to someone to whom I sent a message not too long ago.  The 
person sitting at the other computer was quite surprised as well!)

I was wrong.  I need a function equiv to auto-move-deleted-msgs
to do what I want.  I still need read messages to stay in inbox.
Also, I only want deleted messages stored -- not ones I read and moved to 
another folder to save.

Chris,

The next release of Pine will include support for the "mailcap" 
configuration file.  This will allow you to configure just about any 
combination of "viewers"...

Thanks for the request!

I would like to see two things in the next version of PINE:
 *) A "fcc" entry in the address book.
 *) On the fly compression/decompression.

I'd like the "fcc" entry because some mailing lists don't seem to always 
receive the letters to them and it would be nice to have a copy on hand.  
I don't want to "fcc" every message I send because disk space at this 
site is so limited.

Again, because disk space is limited, it would be nice to see a way for 
pine to "gzip" its mail directories after reading them and to "gunzip" 
them when forming the index.  Will a feature like this be supported in 
the mailcap entries?  We'd like to create as few scripts as necessary.

We have currently set up aliases for people who recieve large amounts of 
mail (as per the reasons stated previously <g>) and as a result have had 
to set the environment variable MAIL $HOME/.newmail  This is suppposed 
(we were under the presumption) to be used by all mail readers, not just 
the system mail utilities.  Apparently this is not so.  Is there any way 
to have pine acknowledge this variable without having to specify it for 
each person.  If not, what happens if we put incoming-folders=$MAIL in 
the .pinerc file and MAIL is not set?

All help will be appreciated.

Chris,

The next release of Pine won't have much of any change in the addressbook 
code, but there are some developments on the horizon that will probably 
cause a restructuring of the addressbook code.  There are also some other 
Fcc related enhancements coming.

A compressed folder mechanism is requested quite often, but it is not 
high on our priority list.  We feel that it is more cost effective (for 
the University of Washington) to buy extra disks than to buy the extra 
CPUs it would take to handle the compression/uncompression.  

However, if someone would like to write a compressed folder driver, it
shouldn't take more than a couple hundred lines of code (plus the zip/unzip
code).  Take a look at the file c-client/mbox.c for an example of a driver
that could be used as a pattern. 

Thanks for the request!

I have a number of users who are having trouble with pico. All of these
users only experience this problem when using a modem to connect to our
DEC 5000/260 running Ultrix 4.3A. The problem is they cannot use the
return key or the backspace key. This is only a problem in pico. vi and
emacs as well as other programs function fine. Whenever they press
return or backspace, pico beeps and says unknown command. This is pico
2.3 and 1.8. Any and all help would be appreciated, thanks.

Then don't give us PGP directly.  Have configuration variables called,
say, encrypt_cmd (for the user chosen encryption/verification program)
get_my_key_cmd (called by pine to get the user's private key -- this can
be bound to simply reading from a file or to uploading it from the user's
PC in case of a dial-in session) and get_their_key_cmd (to get some other
user's public key to verify their message or to encrypt messages sent to
them -- this would probably get bound to a program that accesses a public
key directory somewhere).  Then add the commands Sign and Encrypt to the
message composer, Verify and Decrypt to the message reader.  These
commands will be visible and activated only if the above variables are
set, and they will use these variables to know what to do. And then it is
the users' business what they binds their public key scheme to -- they can bind
it to Clipper if they like :)

The same approach can be taken as a temporary measure for folder
compression (which for me is very important).  Have three configuration
variables: compress_cmd, uncompress_cmd and compressed_suffix (which for
gzip will be .gz). 

The simplest initial implementation will be the following: in the folder
menu, there will be the command Compress which will compress the folder. 
>From then on, the folder will be displayed in the folders' screen by its
compressed file name (say large.gz), and when it is chosen for open it
will be uncompressed.  When such a folder is closed, the user will be
prompted with "compress folder large (y/n/^C)?" to decide whether this
folder is to be recompressed. 

The above should be quite easy to implement; at a later stage, it may be a 
good idea to actually incorporate gzip into pine, but this should not be 
a high priority IMO.

Ran,

Techniques for using PGP with the current release of Pine have been
discussed over the past few days.  If you missed it, send me private mail
and I will forward you a copy. 

As far as compression goes, by far the cleanest and easiest to implement
solution is to write a c-client driver for a compressed mailbox format. 
As previously mentioned, we do not see a need for it on our systems,
therefore it is very low on our priority list.

This doesn't seem possible for the current version of Pine.  For now, 
the best thing to do, I think, would be to get in the habit of saving 
messages rather than deleting them.  I think that this feature would 
require lots of new code, as, currently, Pine makes no distinction 
between messages which have been deleted because you saved them and 
messages which have just plain been deleted.

Does 3.89 support more than one postponed message?  If not, how high is 
that on the priority list?  I'm just wondering, it's nothing essential.

Second, does ctrl-l (redraw the screen) force a check for new messages in 
the INBOX or is it still 3 down arrows, past the last INBOX message (as 
per thepine 3.85 tech docs?)


Thanks!

ps.	pine's the best!  everone here loves it!

Hussain,

Pine 3.89 only supports one postponed message, but Mike is currently
working on the changes to support multiple postponed messages so they
should make it into 3.90. 

Ctrl-L does force a check for new messages in Pine 3.89.

I do multiple postponed messages like this:

1) Make sure your .pinerc file has an entry like feature-list=enable-suspend
   or feature-list=old-growth
2) Postpone the 1st message.
3) Suspend Pine (^Z)
4) `cd ~/mail' (or your mail directory if you've changed it)
5) `mv postponed-mail p1' <-- if this is your second postponed message, 
   p2, etc.
6) `fg'
7) Now you can postpone another message.
8) To restore a previously postponed message:
   a) Suspend Pine (^Z)
   b) `cd ~/mail'
   c) `mv p1 postponed-mail'
   d) `fg'

It's not the most convienient method, but it works.

Is there a way in pine to show a list of all folders that have unread 
messages? Or a way to show only folders with messages?

Thanks,

I cab't recall if this has been mentioned before, but I would like to be 
able to list mail folders by size, not just by alpha. I know there have 
been requests for showing the number of messages of one type or another in a 
folder, but I'm wondering if 1) this capability will be added to pine, or 
2) someone knows how to add that capability. 

thanx,
shy

P.S. Showing the number of messages in a folder would probably be roughly 
the same thing, but also harder to implement, I would guess.

Hello-
 I've gotten the folloring error message, which is confusing the heck out 
of me:
[502 You have no permission to talk.  Goodbye.]

I've searched the source code and the documentation, and I think this is 
coming from the system. Anmyone have any idea what this means?

Lawrence,

Unfortunately there is too much overhead in checking the size of remote
folders to be practical.  Showing the number of messages is actually
easier to implement, since the primitives exist in IMAP/c-client to do
this easily.  It still entails a considerable amount of overhead though... 

Thanks for the suggestions!

I beleive I sent this message out once before but I have gotten no 
responses, so I am reposting.

We have some users who subscribe to listservers and get lots of mail.  We 
have aliased these people's incoming mail folders to their home 
directories and set the MAIL variable to point to that file.  This 
variable is documented in the sendmail (mail/Mail) documentation, but 
apparently is ignored by PINE.  What we currently have to do is for 
people who want to use PINE is to manually edit the .pinerc file to point 
to that file, which is an unneeded nuicance.  Can PINE be written to use 
the MAIL variable or is it already?  How do we implement such a system?

Also, the other thing I forgot to mention is that MAIL isn't set for all 
users, just those with non-standard mailboxes so the mail program can 
find it.  If we put incoming-messages=$MAIL in the .pinerc file when MAIL 
is undefined, will PINE still use the system mailbox?

Chris,

Try setting "inbox-path=$MAIL" in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.  This should work
as long as the file exists.  If your MTA or other mail program deletes an
empty INBOX, you will get an error you would not get with inbox-path blank,
but other than that you should be OK.  I haven't exhaustively checked that
unset environment variables are handled properly by all systems, but they
should just expand to NULL, which is fine for Pine... 

Thanks for the request!

One thing that is a bit of a problem I've noticed is the "Send" key ("^X") 
is RIGHT NEXT to the "Cancel" key ("^C").  Some people (well, at least 
me!) get into the habit of typing fast, and sometimes miss a key..  Then 
you type "Y" automatically and *POOF* there goes your message...

Perhaps using another key to initiate send might be nice??

Thanks,

Mike

Hi!
	I was wondering if there was any way to prioritize or restructure 
the list of folders in the Folder List so the folders appear in an order, 
alphebetically or otherwise.
	Can this be done through the .pinerc or /usr/local/lib/pine.conf?

Hussain

Well, there hasn't been much discussion.  I don't want to say it too
clearly, but, ah, the level of interest doesn't convince me that the
group will carry.

Here's a suggested charter, anyway.  If you have any comments, please
do it, and quickly.  I've redirected followups into news.groups, if
you don't want to read that group you can reply via mail to me.


comp.mail.pine          About the Pine mail user agent

Charter:
  This group is for discussion about use and development of the Pine
mail/news user agent developed by the University of Washington.  Any
Pine-related and Pine-specific discussion is acceptable, but general
discussion regarding e.g. MIME or incoming-mail filters is referred
to other, more appropriate newsgroups.
  The group will not be moderated.  To be made moderated, the same
voting procedures should be followed as for the creation of a new
group at that time.
  The group will be bidirectionally gatewayed to the
pine-info@cac.washington.edu mailing list.

This has been pointed out a few times, but unfortunately it is far too 
late to make that kind of fundamental change in the user interface.  We 
already got burned pretty bad on what we thought was a pretty minor 
change for the prYnt command...

	I used to have the same problem a few months ago and then I just
got used to pressing Return after pressing ^X. If I had successfully
pressed X then the message would be sent, the default for Send being to
send the message, and if i had pressed C by mistake I'd be back into
compose mode, the default action for Cancel being NOT to cancel the
message. 

Pico without ^X, would be like Emacs without ^X^C; it just wouldnt be the 
same again!

Mike,

That is another user-support nightmare we don't want to get any where near. 
If anything programmable definitions are even more of a support nightmare
than a static change... 

Thanks for the followup!

I figured as much... However, would it be possible (well, probable...) 
to include programmable key definitions in some future release?  That way 
a user with exceedingly fat fingers (like me) could customize the 
interface around things like this while leaving the vanilla interface alone.

Thanks for a great product!

Mike

Like, maybe, ^S (S for "send")?  Be careful when you start mucking about 
with key bindings like that.  We had a problem on our campus with new 
unix (and pine) users hitting ^S, and subsequently complaining that their 
sessions just "locked up".  ^S, you may recall, is normally the XOFF 
character, which is _SUPPOSED_ to "lock up" the terminal.  And ^Q is 
bound to XON....... Most of the rest of the function keys already have 
bindings within pine.  What would you suggest they move it to?  Or 
perhaps you should consider starting pine with the switch (I forget 
which one it is) that maps essential functions to F keys.

Has anyone made pine 3.89 work on a Sequent Balance 8000 system? If so I
would like to know what changes were necessary. I am running Dynix 3.1.4
(not Dynix/ptx) which is a BSD4.3 flavor of UNIX.

Thanks

	Oh, let's not change those keystrokes too often.  Now people are 
used to ^X as send.  If they change it now, that will confuse everyone 
else and we'll have to get used to something else (e,g, ^S, which will 
lock up some folks' keyboards, or ^O (for get that *O*ut of here), which 
some people will think should postpone the message) etc.

I got it going on a S81 running Dynix 3.2.0; it was pretty
straightforward. If you'd like I could send you the diffs.

There is no way to change the ordering, except in the incoming-folders 
collection which follows the order in the .pinerc entry (oops, that's 
what 3.90 will do, sorry ;)

Helene,

There is not currently an official "Pine user's guide."  About the closest
thing we have at this time is the online help.  There is a pretty good
chapter on Pine in the "Instant Internet" book, and our documentation group
is working on a "getting started with Pine" pamplet, but I don't think it is
quite done yet.  There are also some tutorials done by other sites, but 
we don't have anything current from them...

Philip,

What command does it say is unknown?  It should be listed in the error

Well, it's a start.  Unfortunately it appears to only be available for export
in binary form on a few platforms.  Where does that leave our users of
Convex, Linux and 25 or so other platforms that binaries are not available
for?

Charlie,

There are some definite inconsistencies in what folder names are allowed 
currently.  Thanks for the report!

Hi folks.  I've been a little hesitant about publicizing this, but I have
a set of pine docs that's being tossed around U-Mich.  It's a beginner's
guide to Pine.  Although it does have some things that are specifically
meant for my school (UM school of Natural Resources and Environment), I
could remove them and distribute a PS version.  Mind you it's not as
comprehensive as the Pine online help, but from experience, i've found
that it does cover about 90% of my users' questions.  

It was spawned out of a need for some "quickie" pine docs.  I originally
intended to have it be 1 page both sides, but I quickly found that writing
docs takes longer than I thought.  After about 2 weeks, It's final form
ended up being 10 pages, and now it's 13.  It's written for the computer
novice.  I tried to stay away from using technical language.  For anyone
who's been using pine for more than a month, it'll be mostly review.
Nevertheless, I've had to move 40 or so people over to pine since
February, and this doc has worked so far.  I've had people at the U say
that they worked for their departments too.

I'm working on the latest revision (touching up some of the new stuff I
wrote yesterday), But if you send me email (altitude@umich.edu) , I can
forward off a PS file pretty soon (couple of days).  I'd do it sooner,
but I got finals this week... UUGH. :(

Oh yeah, There's a plain text version on 
  gopher.snre.umich.edu (in the "SNRE Computer Documentation") section.

And on:
  http://www.snre.umich.edu/snre/pine.intro.html

NOTE, both of these are the old versions.  I'd ask that you don't print a
copy because i'm working on a new set.  (but that's just a request).  

Have fun.

Jon,

   I had pine3.89 running on a Sequent Balance machine running Dynix 
3.0.12.  However, I have since upgraded to PTX and do not recall all the 
changes I had to make.  But, you are not fighting a winless battle - it 
is possible.

I can see no problem with allowing +users+ to reprogram keys.  The 
problem would be with administrators doing so, since users on the 
affected systems would need to be quite sophisticated before they would 
be able to discern the character of the change and thus at the mercy of 
bad documentation, inappropriate changes, etc. etc.

I spoze its impossible to imagine a keyboard mapping routine that was 
offlimits to system operators and available to individual accounts.  
Violates a basic law of nature or something.  Maybe such a beast is 
available in unix in some form that could be used as an interface between 
the keyboard and pine.  I type ^S (for send), the "black box" hears ^S 
and is set up to transmit ^X, pine "hears" ^X.  (And of course ^S doesn't 
do whatever ^S is supposed to do when pine is running -- suspend I/O? -- 
and that function isn't available to me unless I have remapped some other 
key into that function.)

Many wordprocessors have facilities like this built in.  If there were a 
way of doing it for unix operations, I would map the keyboard to be more 
like WordPerfect because that's what I use all the time when off-line; in 
particular the PageUp PageDown Home and End keys.  

But I don't think this facility should be pine-specific.  I should just 
be possible to use it with pine (and other useful programs) if available.

Good point.  Perhaps what would be useful here is a moved (or saved) 
flag.  Instead of morking messages that were saved into another folder as 
deleted, perhaps they can be marked as moved (which would still mean 
deleted from this folder).

Having used, to date, mailers and posters that put my sig after everything, 
even the copy of the mailer I am replying to, I am very used to that as my
mail format.  I don't really like the feel of having my sig seperate my note
from the copy to which I am replying.  Is there any way to put a line in my
.pinerc to tell pine that I want it to stick my sig _after_everything_ rather
than seperating my note from the reply copy?

Also, is there a way to set my word wrap so that it doesn't wrap so quickly.
When I use vi, I use the command "set wm=1" so that I can use as much of the
page as possible.  That's just me.  But, I would like to know how to tell pine
that I want to wrap on the last character, and not before that.  Can anyone
fill me in?

Thanks...

Add signature-at-bottom to the feature-list in your .pinerc.

	Morking files ? Shazbat... 

	I think this is starting to get a teensy bit ridiculous. Perhaps 
it would be neater to implement saving in another folder as a move (ie. 
it disappears from the INBOX or whatever immediately) and have a function 
that works on messages marked as deleted.

David,

When do you expect to have 3.90 ready for public consumption?

Thanks,

I have requested this before, and would still like to see this implemented.

Hi,

Wanted to find any information on compiling pine for HP-UX 9.0x.  I tried 
to use "build hpp", but, as I thought would happen since this port was 
not documented as useful for 9.0, I had major problems. Not knowing 
enough about tracking these problems down, I was hoping for some help.

Any comments on this matter would be very much appreciated...

The HP port of Pine 3.89 was tested exclusively on an HP/UX 9.0.1 
system.  What kind of problems are you having?

Hi,
	I am running pine3.89 on Esix SVR4 with a NetBSD0.9 system as the
mail server.  Some of my users have been complaining that pine doesn't
attach the proper date to the messages they send.  What could be the cause
of this?  What can I do to correct this?

Lisa,

We will continue to tune security on all versions of Pine, but there is not
much you can do to prevent someone with a desire from forging mail.  About
all we can do is not make it easier than it is without Pine. 

Thanks for the request!

Subject: How do you change domain name?

Bear with me, this is not as simple as you probably think ...

In my .pinerc file:
user-domain=umich.edu
use-only-domain-name=yes

I've also tried with use-only-domain-name=no.

Here's the problem.  When I subscribe to a listserv or listproc mailing 
list, the listserver figures out my real domain name (which is 
engin.umich.edu) and registers me with that address.  I prefer to get my 
mail through our X.500 gateway (umich.edu).

Are there more .pinerc entries than are documented in the .pinerc file?  
Such as, perhaps, local-domain?  What motivates my question is a few 
lines I saw in .pine-debugX.

---------- .pine-debug1 (excerpt)
Userid: messina
Fullname: "Matt Messina"
User domain name being used "umich.edu"
Local Domain name being used "engin.umich.edu"
Host name being used "azure.engin.umich.edu"
Mail Domain name being used "umich.edu"
---------- .pine-debug1 (excerpt)

Somehow, the Local Domain seems to be escaping, although I'd like to hide 
it from the listservers.  Is there a way to stop this?  Thanks for any help.

     [General love of ^K applied]

Since I have lost the similar reply to my own mail, I would like to 
slightly clarify:  When you reply to a file, signature-at-bottom works 
fine.  If, however, you FORWARD a file, your signature appears at the 
beginning, regardless of the signature-at-bottom setting.  Perhaps we 
should have two variables to choose from:
  signature-at-bottom (for compatibility)
  signature-at-bottom2 (for forwards.)  

Granted, #2 isn't very clear, but is there a better suggestion than 
signature-at-bottom-for-forwards-too?

It built out of the box for me on:
hp-ux 8.03 on 9000/845
hp-ux 9.00 on 9000/433
hp-ux 9.01 on 9000/735
hp-ux 9.03 on 9000/712-80i

No warnings...The port was as close to perfect as you can get...

Ugh.  

While I'm told that the recipe does in fact make good cookies, the story is 
completely bogus-- I've heard that exact same tale told regarding Mrs. 
Field's cookies & Famous Amos cookies...same amount, same recipe, in fact 
I think some of the text was the same.  This is probably in the 
alt.folklore.urban FAQ...but regardless...it is just an entertaining tale 
tale.

What it has to do with Pine I'm not sure <g>

If this is acceptable use NOT then maybe everyone could send in gif's of 
the last automobile bill they received where they think they were 
hosed.   For God's sake may seek professional help.

Richard,

Is it just a problem with Daylight Savings time or is it worse than that?

Matt,

If user-domain is set, use-only-domain is ignored.  I think the problem is
that listproc incorrectly uses the Sender: header instead of the From:  or
Reply-To: header.  We have not yet figured out how to completely solve the
"listproc problem" ourselves...

Hi, Pine People:

I hope everybody in this group will keep a professional manner.  Please
don't send anything which is not related to the Pine-info to this mail
list.  We all belong to this group to help each other and help to improve 
the Pine system, NOT to discuss some kind of cookie recipes.

Thank you for supporting.

The best tool for automatic mail processing that's ever crossed my path is 
procmail.  See if your site doesn't have it yet.

You don't have to send mail to test procmail.

You can just use formail to pipe each message from an
existing folder to procmail. Something like:

cat folder | formail -s procmail ...

I was wondering if any sites use wyse terminals with pine, and what 
termcap and/or patches they have made.  I caught the part in the manual 
about UofW not being able to support the various keyboard mappings for 
cursor control, but I have several users that can't move from Wyse to VT 
terminals.

If people have tried to get Wyse's to work, and failed, I would also 
appreciate that feedback as well.  I am getting pressure to make the 
Wyse's work.  One common mailer package to support would be nice, but I 
might have to do two :-(

Dear friends,
   I apologize for the double mail (mistakingly cc'ed to pine-info). I 
wanted to press ^C but missed and pressed ^X ? hmm.. now I see the 
problem the 2 keys being so close can cause.

Thankyou

We had to comment out the highlighting capabilities since the WYSE's
rudely use up a screen cell for the mode change.  This is mentioned
I think in the Pine Tech Notes.  Anyway, from SunOS:

I often use Pine remotely by modem and suspend it with a ^Z 
signal.  Without fail, I end up re-executing pine in the same 
session.  The second copy of pine tries to get a file lock from 
the first, but is unable, so loads itself in "readonly" mode.  
This is fine;  I quit and go back to the first instance of pine.  
However, this session has also become "readonly."  This is not a 
major problem for me, but I was just wondering why both sessions 
became read only when neither of them had a file lock.

I have been using vt320 emulation with Procomm Plus on our PC's.  VT100 
and VT420's terminals also work with no problem.

When you resume the second session, it still has the signal waiting to 
give up its lock.  The problem is that since it was suspended, it could 
not acknowledge the loss of the lock...

Hello Pine-List,
I would like to start with an apology (see below) for send a msg to an 
entire list--I apologize for jamming your mboxes.

In the past I had asked some questions about pine, and the pine-mailing list
(to which I have not recevied very helpful information, BTW) and the 
pine-mailing list stayed in my address-book. When I forwarded the 
"cookies" msg I neglected to check this mailing list off since it was 
filed under the address book "misc" and not say "lists".

I didn't mean to bother you pine-lovers nor is it my practice to send 
junk mail to lists.

On the other hand, the nasty respons that I have recived are also not 
appropriate (what would happen to some begginer if he/she would see such 
nasty hate letters? Is the future of the internet to be like the street 
of New York City or L.A.? I hope NOT).

So, if any of you got offended, please accept my apologies. For those of 
you who offended me (tried...) I can only offer my true simpathy for not 
been able to express themselves better. Too bad.

-Yigal

Actually, I think that the Sender header says what I want it to.  When I 
send myself something, the Sender line says messina@umich.edu, not 
messina@engin.umich.edu.

Maybe it has nothing to do with user agents.  Maybe it's looking at the 
SMTP Received headers?  If that's the case, I don't think that there's 
anything that I (or the Pine Team, for that matter) can do.  Anyone who 
knows anything about how listservers work please tell me.

By the way, you can make Sender say whatever you want by editing it while 
it's in postponed-mail.  You may want to change that, so that the Sender 
line isn't added until you actually send the message.

I think I was able to "forge" this message as far as the From and Sender 
lines are concerned.  I left the Reply-To alone, although that would have 
been just as easy to change.  (I'm using 3.87 in case that matters.)

Oh well, I guess I'll have to take my mailing lists at my "real" 
address.  Thanks anyway.

I've also accidently run two copies of Pine, but I've never had the first 
copy become readonly.

I have noticed in the past on this list a lot inquiries about Pine on VMS.

I just noted that Innosoft, the authors of PMDF an SMTP email package
for VMS, have included in their recent PMDF 4.3 release, Pine 3.89
for VMS.  Their version of Pine _requires_ PMDF to run.

Well, this isn't true, either.  I was sitting at the INBOX folder's index 
list, hit ^Z, and typed "bg".  It said that pine was running in the 
background, but each session still locked.  We have a Sun Sparc 2 under 
SunOS 4.1.x and I call in via a Xyplex server.  I have yet to try it 
under X-Windows, but if this isn't a known problem with the Suns, I'll 
tell ya what happens there as well.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our international project ("International E-Mail Tandem Network" - with
bilingual communication between language learners) we need international
character sets and MIME compliant e-mail tools like PINE.

But we do not really understand PINE's behaviour with respect to character
sets. We expected 4 steps:

1. PINE (sender) knows about platform specific codes (PC code-pages, Windows'
   ANSI, etc.) and maps them to a more general character set like ISO-8859-1.
2. PINE (sender) encodes the message for transport (Base64 or whatever).
3. PINE (receiver) decodes the message.
4. PINE (receiver) maps the general character set (ISO-8859-1 ..) to the
   corresponding platform (Unix, Mac, ...) specific character set.

But we suspect that pine doesn't behave like that. When we send a message
from pc-pine and read it using pine on a NeXt (console or telnet), all
special characters (umlauts, accented letters etc.) are mapped to
nonsense letters.

.pinerc/PINERC say "character-set=ISO-8859-1" on both machines. Is there
anything else we have to do?

Thanks in advance for your help.
Helmut

	pine (3.89 for unix) works with some terminal definitions but not
with others.  I sometimes use TERM=adm3a, and while *pico* works fine with
that terminal definition, pine refuses to run.  I'm thinking of writing a
termcap file for my terminal which makes better use of its capabilities
than adm3a.  [I'm running a Sanyo MBC-1250 CP/M machine 4 MHz Z80, if
anyone is curious--or if anyone already *has* a termcap for this and wants
to send it to me.] I'd like, of course, to be able to run pine.  Is there
some simple answer to the question what capabilities must a terminal
support for pine to run?  If so, what's the answer?  Or does pine simply
use some *list* of acceptable terminals (e.g. "vt100") and refuse to run
if your terminal is not on the list?  Thanks.

On reading the pinerc files for 3.89, it would appear that both should
be available/supported but when I try, I only get one or the other
(usually local).  Is this a bug or feature?

Thanks.

One of our users has mentioned the "terribly slow drawing speed" when
inverted video is used to highlight messages - she is using a modem. 
Following recent correspondence on this list, I suggested that she type an
"stty 1200" command before invoking pine.  

She says that she now gets > instead of highlighting when in the folder
index but not when she is in the main menu.  I see that moving around the
folder index also involves highlighting. 

I thought you might like to see these comments: I have difficulty in
forming a view on this as I have difficulty in simulating the user's
environment.

Helmut,

PC-Pine includes mapping tables for some of the IBM codepages to and from
ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-5, but the other platforms assume that the terminal
or emulation is using the character set specified by character-set in your
.pinerc file.  

>From the Pine Technical Notes:

          In the case of PC-Pine, the  character  values
          cannot  be  passed  thru to the display device
          unaltered  since  MS-DOS  uses  various   non-
          standard character sets called "Code Pages".  

          The mapping between DOS Code Page and standard
          character    set    is   controlled   by   the
          "character-set" variable in  the  PINERC  file
          and  the  PC's  installed  Code Page.  PC-Pine
          will automatically map  common  characters  in
          IBM  Code Pages 437, 850, 860, 863, and 865 to
          ISO-8859-1  and  back  when  the  PINERC   has
          "character-set=ISO-8859-1".   Pine  will  also
          map common characters for IBM Code Page 866 to
          ISO-8859-5  and  back when "character-set=ISO-
          8859-5".  The mappings are bi-directional, and
          applied  to  all saved text attachments in the
          defined character set, messages exported, etc.

          Alternatively, the translation tables  can  be
          configured  externally and applied at run time
          whenever the "character-set=" variable is  set
          to  something  other  then "US-ASCII" (the de-
          fault).  PC-Pine looks in the text file point-
          ed  to by the environment variable "ISO_TO_CP"
          for the table to use for mapping text matching
          the type defined by the "character-set=" vari-
          able into the local Code Page value.   PC-Pine
          looks  in  the text file pointed to by the en-
          vironment variable "CP_TO_ISO" for  the  table
          to use for mapping text in the local Code Page
          into   outbound   text   tagged    with    the
          "character-set=" variable's value.

          A text file containing a character set mapping
          table  is  expected  to  contain  256 elements
          where  each  element  is  a   decimal   number
          separated from the next element by white-space
          (space, tab or newline, but no commas!).   The
          index  of the element is the character's value
          in the source character set, and the element's
          value  is  the corresponding character's value
          in the destination character set.

Does that help?

Sorry for the earlier should-have-gone-to-majordomo post...and I just 
told someone that the other day on another list <hangs his head in shame> 
<holds out his knuckles for the wooden ruler>

But I do have a Bona Fide Question.  I've heard both a "Pine User's Guide" 
and a "New to Pine Help Guide" mentioned occaisionally here.  I snooped 
around ftp.cac.washington.edu but was unable to find them.  If someone 
could drop me either a copy or a pointer or a "that doesn't exist", I 
would be (almost) eternally grateful.

I work for U-Michigan's ITD User Services, which will be spending the 
summer writing documentation for students moving to Pine, so any existing 
documentation would be very helpful.  Likewise, if anyone knows of 
on-line Pico docs, I would be very grateful for the aforementioned 
copy/pointer, as the only thing I've found is pico's internal help system.

Thank you!

We have just installed a new PMDF system on our VMS machine.  It came 
with pine.  (This is being sent from pine on VMS) 

It has a few bugs that cause stack dumps that I would like to see fixed if
possible. 

Question:  Is anyone supporting it?  

Please reply to me directly as I don't subscribe to the list.
Thanks.  TJ Olney     olney2@nessie.cc.wwu.edu

Andrew,

Whack!!!  Feel better? ;)

We don't have a User's guide of our own ready yet, but I do know of a WWW
page (http://www.snre.umich.edu/snre/pine.intro.html) done at UMich Scool of
Natural Resources and Environment and a document by Allison Anderson
<allison@lclark.edu>.

you should address your VMS Pine problems to service@innosoft.com, yes
we support it, but not the University of Washington (not directly anyway)

Hi folks.  Due to the recent flurry of "I NEED A USER GUIDE!" requests,
I've modified my home grown documentation to a more generalized "internet
version".  

Actually, all i've done is strip all of the Univeristy of Michigan, and
School of Natural Resources and Environment specific stuff.  Everything
else is untouched.

I've put up both a PostScript version, and a Macintosh, Microsoft Word
version 5.1a version as well.   (the word version has been binhexed).  

Feel free to modify it as needed, but of course, please leave my name, and
UM/UM-SNRE's name on it as well.  Also, if you do modify it, please send
me the copy that you are using.  It'd just be nice for me to see what
other people have to say.  (and besides, I don't think that my writing is
that good).  

it is available via ftp in:

ftp.snre.umich.edu:/pub/pine/documentation/pine.internet.doc.Hqx (word version)
ftp.snre.umich.edu:/pub/pine/documentation/pine.internet.doc.ps (PostScript)

(a note for those who i sent an explicit message to:, note the file
location has changed a bit...sorry...my fault).

In a couple of days, there will be a HTML version at 

http://www.snre.umich.edu/pine/pine.internet.doc.html

Here's my disclaimer about it:

This piece of documentation was originally written for the University of 
Michigan, School of Natural Resources and Environment.  It's target 
audience was/is/are novice computer users who have been using UM's 
mainframe computing system (the Michigan Terminal System, or MTS).  The 
documentation is by no means a definitive explanation of all of pine's 
features, but I have found that it does answer about 90 - 95% of a first 
time user's questions.  (I'll leave out the legal garbage, but it's written 
in the document proper.)

---end disclaimer... 

Please feel free to send me feedback about it (flames too, although If 
you put "flame" anywhere in the subject line, procmail will dissapate it 
as heat. :) .  I must admit, I don't think myself as much of a writer, 
but I've worked hard to make this as comprehensible as possible.

Sorry about the delay...

On our campus, our IBM RS/6000 computers are accessed by most users
through an Equinox Data Switch.  Connections through this switch are set
to timeout after a certain period of inactivity (30 minutes) in order to
free up ports on our RS/6000s for usage by other users. 

Our systems administrator recently noticed that some of our users had 
been in the same Pine session all day long.  Our first hypothesis as to 
how this could be the case was that these users were receiving or 
sending messages at least every 30 minutes.  In order to check this out, 
we started a Pine session, and discovered that even when no mail was 
received or sent out of a Pine session, about every 2 and a half 
minutes, our data switch sensed activity, and reset its timeout timer for 
this particular port.

Our question, then, is the following:  Does Pine send some signal to the
terminal every 2 and a half minutes?   If so, is there anyway to 
reconfigure Pine so that it doesn't do this?

Susan,

Pine does a new mail check every 300 seconds.  During this check a '*' is
displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.  There is currently no
way to disable this without changing the code.  Actually, I was under the
impression that most inactivity timeouts only look at the incoming line and
are thus unaffected by the spurious characters. 

Thanks for the report!

Alex,
	I tried ftping to your cite to get the pine user guide, but when I
tried logging in as ftp or anonymous it told me user unknown.  If there is
a problem with the server would you just e-mail me a copy of the guide for
MS word?

Thanks
Rick Gaine

If I can connect to difference news servers and they do not  have the 
same newsgroups, will I get bogus messages when checking new newsgroups 
for different server after 3.90?  Can I have different .newsrcs for 
different news servers?

Henry,
The .newsrc file format uses article numbers that are tied to a specific 
server.  At the moment Pine assumes you only have one .newsrc file.

We'll add to the request list the need to be able to specify the path of
the newsrc file, so you could use the -p command line option to point to a
different .pinerc specifying a different .newsrc (as well as news host).

	I have a suggestion for a new Pine feature. (If this is already 
taken care of, let me know! I can't find out how to do it) 
	I, like many of you, I'm sure, belong to many mailing lists. 3 to 
be exact, (2 active ones and 1 inactive one) What I would like to see is 
a sort the TO: field command line option. That way, I'll get the Emacs 
first, Pine second etc... I love the "+" for personal msgs.
	If anybody adds this feature, please send me a copy of the code 
to use. Thanks...

Hi David

If you use multiple folders and tab between them, you often have to deal 
with:

No more messages.  View next folder "Procmail"? (y/n/^C) [y]:

Are there any plans to let the tab key:
1. Move silently to the next folder.
2. Skip across folders with no new messages?

These enhancements would be great.

Thanks and regards,
Kevin

I have tried several ways to not have pine read my .newsrc file. How do 
you eliminate this? I have tried modifying my .pinerc file, but with no 
luck. What obvious thing am I missing.

Subject: Q: Why use pine (looking for justification)

Hello,

My department (CTS) takes care of mail at Trent University.  The mail hub 
is VMS host running PMDF and most our accounts are on this host.  We also 
support UNIX (Ultrix).  I take care of UNIX, NetWare and Pathworks.  For 
mailers we use VMS Mail on VMS hosts, Elm (sorry) and Pine on UNIX 
hosts,  Pathworks Mail on PC-Pathworks workstations and there is very 
limited use of Pegasus Mail for NetWare clients.  Ergo, we're faced with 
the problems outlined in the document describing imap vs. pop - and CTS 
would like to provide a reliable and manageable solution for VMS, UNIX, 
PC and MAC users.

Having read the docs and just installed PC Pine (of course imapd on UNIX) 
I'm of the opinion that imap clients are the way to go...

So, may question really is; can you folks point me to other institutions 
you might be aware of who have gone this route?  For example, are there 
sites where PC Pine has been selected over Pegasus Mail...I'd like to get 
their reasons.  Some of our faculty are impressed with Pegasus largely 
because it is the first mailer they've seen running on a DOS box - and 
they compare it to VMS Mail (all that colour is impressive :-) ).  But 
they are unaware of the need for gateways (Charon/Mercury), the problem 
of managing them and, importantly, the difficulties one can encounter 
when attachements are made to mail by various methods rather than by a 
standard.  I could go on, but I'm sure the scenario is one you've seen 
many times...

Perhaps you are aware of some papers on the matter?

Thanks...I look forward to your response.

My suspicion is that this is a problem faced by all (educational)
institutions with user bases on a variety of different platforms.

> Having read the docs and just installed PC Pine (of course imapd on UNIX)

That's the decision we made.  Computing Services here at the UofS
spawned a small commitee to look into e-mail solutions.  They released
a report a few weeks ago, which I beleive is on our gopher server and
available to poeple outside the UofS (I can't say for certain though).
The short version is that imap is good, and Pine is good, and if you
can't use Pine, use another imap client.  Here's their recomendations
on a platform basis:

	Macintosh:		Mailstrom
	DOS:			PC-Pine
	Windows:		ECS-Mail
	Unix chatacter cell:	Pine
	VMS character cell:	None (although this was before 
				PMDF came with VMS Pine)

I you want to have a look at the documents, which cover oather products
testes, selection criteria etc etc, try either our gopher server, 
gopher.usask.ca, in the Computing directory, or our web server,
http://www.usask.ca/ (there is a link here to the gopher server).

> Thanks...I look forward to your response.

Hope this helps

Perhaps someone can help this friend of mine.  I don't think he reads 
pine-info, so replies need to be by mail to be useful to him.

Thanks for any suggestions you can make.

I co-moderate a mailing list.  I receive messages, approve them, then 
want to send them on to an alias which gets them out to the whole list.  
While I'm at it, I want to edit the lines in the header so the message 
appears to come from the original poster, and to direct replies 
automatically to the original poster.  Pine doesn't give you access to 
those lines, I don't even know how to edit them with the Mail program.  
What tool can be used to edit those lines in an outgoing message?

I have successfully ported pine to HP-UX 8.0 on an HP 400 box, and SunOS 4.1.2
on a SUN 630mp.  I am now trying to port to Solaris 2.3, but have received the
errors shown below my signature.  If anyone could help me figure out what I
should do next (not being a programmer, but having some C knowledge) I would be
very grateful.

I don't know which one you're talking about, but I have some if you want
to take a look.  they're in 

ftp.snre.umich.edu:/pub/pine/documentation/pine.internet.doc.Hqx 
  (this is a mac MS Word 5.1 doc)

and:
ftp.snre.umich.edu:/pub/pine/documentation/pine.internet.doc.ps
  (a ps version of the same doc).

hope that this helps.
