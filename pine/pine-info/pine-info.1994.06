Subject: Pine on Solaris does a seg. fault...
Message-Id: <Cqp7Er.L83@IRO.UMontreal.CA>
Date: Wed, 1 Jun 1994 03:08:50 GMT

	I've compiled Pine 3.89 for SunOS, DEC OSF/1 and Solaris, and I have
some problems with the Solaris version.  It does compile correctly, but
when I run it, with a system-wide pine.conf in /usr/local/lib, Pine does
a segmentation fault. When I remove the system-wide pine.conf file, Pine
runs just correctly, however, without our domain defaults.  If I execute
the SunOS version under Solaris compatibility mode, it does indeed work,
w/o any crash.  For the sake of it, I downloaded the solaris binary from
ftp.cac.washington.edu and I get the exact same result.  

	Running the SunOS binary under compatibility mode isn't a solution
here, we need a native binary under Solaris.  And we can't live without
a system-wide pine.conf file.  Any hints?

Hi there, 
	would it be possible for you guys to include compression in your
program, I like to keep my sent mail -- but obviously I'm not looking at
it all the time. So could PINE be extended so that it compress the
sent-mail folder at the start of the month (when it gives it a new name). 

Regards,

Anand.

Hi Im interested in whether or not there's a filter which can be used

something similar with Pine.

However, IBM's TCPIP for OS2 includes a winsock package for DOS boxes 
under OS/2, so the planned Winsock version will (should) also work under 
OS/2.

When is the planned availability of that, by the way?

I've been reading about ASCII uploads/downloads on another newsgroup, and 
the consensus was that if you transfer the file in ASCII rather than as a 
binary file (as Kermit and I think Zmodem do) the end-of-line problem is 
taken care of. Procomm at least provides the opportunity to make an ASCII 
upload. I find I can't use it while in Pine because it comes out as 
scrambled eggs. (Though if I send the eggs, they reach the adressee 
unscrambled.) So I more often upload to the Unix shell, pico the file, 
then go into Pine and insert it with Ctrl R.

	The "filter" program just happens to come with elm.  It has no
connection whatever with elm.  The same goes for the other popular
filter program procmail.

Is this true?  If it is available, where can we get it ...

I must agree with Simon.  The volume on the mail list is approaching the 
intolerable level.

I subscribe to pine-info to hear from the Pine Development team *information*
about Pine, development, administration and support. I believe the decision
to interface the newsgroup and the mailing list was not correct.  Mail isn't
news and mailing lists and newsgroups are different beasts. 

Can the powers that be please consider:

1. Killing the auto-interface between the list and newsgroup

or

2. Implementing a pine-announce or pine-admin mailing list where 
discussion of signature file dashes, usage questions and general chit 
chat are discouraged?

I don't mind reading the mailing list and keeping up with comp.mail.pine, 
but I dislike having a newsgroup in my mailbox.  I would like to see this 
happen *before* the inevitable cross-posted flame war engulfs my mail 
spool!

FTPing the file up to your Unix system in ASCII mode (the default for FTP) 
should convert DOS CR-LF end-of-line sequences to Unix LFs.

DOS2UNIX is part of PC-NFS and is used if you NFS-mount your Unix home 
directory as a DOS drive (then you save the WP file in ascii mode on your NFS 
drive, DOS2UNIX it and ^Read it into Pine).

Of course if you want to send your WP file as a WP-formatted document rather 
than as plain ASCII text you don't need any of this - just get it to your Unix 
host (in Binary format if using FTP) and Attach it to your message.

And if you use PC-PINE you don't have all the messing around with FTP or 
NFS-mounted filesystems - ^R reads in from your DOS filesystem, and understands 
DOS file format. The downside is that, for me at least, PC-PINE doesn't work 
too well with Windows: it needs loads of free conventional memory, and requires 
a network stack like a house of cards and seems to slow down other processes' 
network access by an order of magnitude. Roll on the promised Winsock version. 
And keep up the good work David, Terry & Co!

If an MTA will mangle a message with a 7-bit ASCII-TEXT attachment
then,
exactly, how does BASE64 encoding prevent that from happening?

All I have to say is this: If 90% of the people I send mail to do not
have
MIME-compatible readers, then you've just encouraged (if not forced) me
to
NOT use Pine 90% of the time.  That doesn't sound like a very good way
to
expand your user base...

I generally resent programs (and programmers) that feel it's necessary
to
IMPOSE their views of 'correctness' on me and my work.  All it takes is
two
vendors who decide to do something like that and suddenly I have two
programs
that won't work together.

Yes, this is true.  But my mailer doesn't ASSUME that uuencoding is
necessary for ALL ATTACHMENTS!!!  For instance, I have a friend that
works for Bell Atlantic, and if my mailer automatically uuencoded
attachments then I'd have to stop using the mailer.  All instances
of uuencode/decode are removed from their systems as they don't want
people exchanging (possibly) virus-infected programs through e-mail.

There you go again, trying to impose YOUR view of 'correctness' on the
world.  With the analogy of uuencoded attachments, do you really
believe
that a company like Bell Atlantic is going to take the time (and $$$)
to change their corporate policy just so they can conform to YOUR idea
of 'correct'-ness ?!?

*I* think they'd just choose not to use your mailer...

If you guys would follow this one guideline, it'll make
both your (and our) lives much easier:

    Deal with things as they ARE, not how you think they OUGHT to be.

Most major computer companies pursue backwards compatability until it's
clear
that they're just whipping a dead horse.  The only time incompatability
is 
tolerated is when you're introducing an entirely different product
(like the
introduction of the Mac) and nobody's going to be using the 'old' stuff
on
the new systems...

X-Owner:    pine-announce-request@cac.washington.edu
X-To:       pine-announce@cac.washington.edu

For all of you bursting with curiousity, here's the latest on 3.90...

I've been saying "late spring" (i.e. June 20th :) for the *beta* release
of 3.90, and I think we'll be close to that goal, but won't quite make it. 
So think in terms of late June, but don't be too surprised if is slips
into July.

(Prudent planners should realize that we --unlike other s/w development
groups-- have never been very accurate in our s/w schedule predictions and
should adjust expectations accordingly.) Rest assured that there is plenty
of smoke around here as the guys' fingers burn up the keyboards, but there
are still a number of things we feel it is important to include that
aren't done yet... 

There are several hundred changes since 3.89.  Here's a preview of 
the major stuff:

 o Finished all the "Not implemented yet" commands:
        -Bounce (remail)
        -Flag (set message status)
        -Pipe (Unix only)
        -Select/Apply
        -Zoom
        -Setup/Options   (pinerc config screen)
 o News posting
 o News subscription/unsubscription
 o Multiple address books
 o Postpone multiple messages
 o Customizable headers for Composer
 o Mailcap support
 o Improved support for multiple incoming message folders
 o always-use-alt-editor feature (except for editing headers)
 o All .pinerc features now settable from command line
 o Way to control which options are user-configurable (Unix only)
 o Way to have Save *not* implicitly delete
 o Way to use current-working-directory for Export, ^R, etc.
 o And with any luck, a Winsock version of PC-Pine

Select/Apply gives you "aggregate" operations, e.g. Select all messages
 from joe, then you can Apply message commands to the entire selection...
 Zoom lets you focus on just the selected messages.

And now for the bad news.  Here are some things we want as much as you do, 
but are not likely to make it into 3.90...

 o Additional MIME support, e.g. file typing map, resolving external refs 
 o PEM/PGP (or equiv) support
 o External directory services access*
 o Kerberos support
 o RFC 1522 header encoding for 8bit charsets
 o Location independence of support files (e.g. .pinerc, .addressbook)
 o Offline support
 o Hierarchy support (awaits IMAP4)
 o Answered flag not set if Reply is postponed  (awaits IMAP4)
 o Faster detection of folders with Recent messages (awaits IMAP4)
 o Faster fetching of headers (awaits IMAP4)
 o Determination of which flags are permanent (awaits IMAP4)

   * unless it is administratively disabled, you will be able to type the 
     PIPE command and enter ";finger foo@bar" but we hope to do better 
     than that in the future :)

I agree 100%. On Tuesday, I had well over 250 messages, with most from 
this list/news group. It seems that since the USENET group has been 
added, a lot of the questions can be answered by actually READING the 
documentation that comes with Pine, especially the help screens. The 
mailing list was better in the past. I don't want to sound elitest, but I 
want the old mailing list back. The newsgroup should remain separate.

That is exactly why I voted against the newsgroup.  Gatewaying the
newsgroup back into the mailinglist is a "bad thing".  But that is what
folks voted for :-(

I would not be unhappy if the folk running the mailinglist blocked posting
from the newsgroup.

Thinking that repeating the old is lower priority than expressing the 
new, I have been arranging replies to e-mail by starting with new stuff, 
then including (edited) incoming, and concluding with included text from 
files or attachments (if any).  In general, I try to avoid the 
point-by-point interpolated format unless specifically engaged in 
commenting on a text.

Correspondents on my local group have politely objected, saying they 
prefer to be reminded of the context first, then see the reply.  (One 
writer also pointed out that old-first new-second encourages people to 
'prune' the old, which he regards as both intellectually and technically 
proper.)

I would be +much+ happier with this arrangement if there were a way to 
search for the first line that +does not+ contain a > in column 1.  Even 
better, IMHO, would be a standardized flag in line one (or the header) of a 
reply that announced the presence of "old" text and allowed those who 
prefer old-first new-second to jump to the old, then back to line 1 (as 
3.90 will reportedly allow) to read the new.  I agree that not knowing 
whether there is, in fact, any old text appended is uncomfortable.  But I 
also find paging through old (and familiar) material tiresome, even when 
it's been pruned.

What to do what to do?  Life is soo full of choices!

Amen!  The recent traffic is unbearable!!  If something cannot be done soon,
it's likely that many of us will ask to be unsubscribed from the list, leaving
the newsgroup groupies to babble on amongst themselves....

I certainly do *not* speak for the Pine group, but I personally think that
even if I don't think they are necessarily going in the right direction,
they have certainly provided more than adequate arguments to support the
way they feel, and I respect that. And I don't think that I recall seeing
"expanding our user base" anywhere in the Pine manifesto.

OK, let's take your suggestion to deal with things as they are.

Neither the Pine team nor the University of Washington is a major computer
company. Ultimately, their only responsibility is to the users at that
site. Through their unbounded generosity, they have made their work (and
support) available to the rest of us at no cost. Even if I'm not 100%
happy with Pine (I would say I'm 98% happy with it), I'd have to say that
that's a pretty good deal.

No, I disagree 100%.  To be honest, I hated the old mailing list.  I'm
pretty anti-mailing list except when it is a small group of people that
keep signal and almost no noise (I found the old pine list to be mostly 
noise to me).  I don't want to have to keep my subscription to the mailing
list now that we have a newsgroup.

"feature" before, by the way. Yes, it is nice when you want to join
the two lines again, but that rarely happens, and in any case an
explicit "join" command could take care of it. Most of the time, those
spaces really ought to be removed, either when the line is split or
when the editor is exited. The latter might be tricky to implement as
it would require the editor to tag these spaces so that it can remove
them but leave any blanks the user explicitly wanted.)

The comp.mail.pine CFV, and now charter, specified that there would be a
bidirectional gateway between the pine-info mailing list and
comp.mail.pine.  That information was posted to the pine-info list, so it
shouldn't surprise anyone.  And the comp.mail.pine proposal, including the
bidirectional gateway, passed by a healthy margin.  I don't remember you
arguing against the proposal in news.groups, or on pine-info.  Did you
vote against it?  Or vote at all? 

As to the signal-to-noise ratio, pine is a MUA novices can use.  It's
hardly surprising that novices will ask questions about it, even sometimes
(unfortunately) questions answered in the online help.  You can always
unsubscribe to the mailing list if this is such a burden.

I will admit I did not vote at all. I performed this non-action mainly
because (a) I ignorantly assumed that it would not make that much
difference in s/n ratio, and (b) I would not be reading it and would still
be on the mailing list, mainly because the newsfeed to my site is, shall
we say, less than adequate. (To give you an idea, neither site I read news
from even has this newsgroup yet.)

I did not consider the consequences of what would happen to the traffic
once this happened. As a result of this bidirectional gateway, my email
box has been flooded with quesitons about signatures, ftp-ing, news
software, filters, forwarding, and many other things that have little or
no importance to Pine and do not belong in a Pine newsgroup. And I can see
now that we are going to continue to get these questions over and over
again.

No, I cannot. I need to be privy to discussions about things that might
or might not be added to the next version of Pine, ports, contributed
software, announcements, etc. As a duty to the users at my site I *must*
be on this mailing list.

The current noise level is absolutely unbearable. I suggest that either
there be a very *long*, frequently-posted FAQL to answer most novice
questions and tell them what is and is not considered a legitimate Pine
question, or moderate the newsgroup.

With "unrotate" I presume you mean "decode".
On Unix(tm) i suggest you do like this:

- save the message you want to decode in a file (infile.txt in example below)
- write the following line in an ordinary text file and save it as
"decode" (or some other name at your liking):

   tr "[a-m][n-z][A-M][N-Z]" "[n-z][a-m][N-Z][A-M]" < infile.txt > outfile.txt

- make sure that you don't have an old file named "outfile.txt"
(remove it, if you have)

- give the command

   source decode

  at the Unix(tm) prompt.

- read the result (decoded text) in outfile.txt.


"tr"-hint borrowed from "The Whole Internet" by Ed Krol, O'Reilly &
Associates, Inc. 1992, pp. 145-146 (recommended as good reading).

There's probably an easier way (you can, for example, try to get your
news reader to read your mail/text file instead of the ordinary news
file), but it works. ;^D

By the way, the ROT13 code is merely the alphabet rotated 13 letters.

I did bring up on news.groups that sending the group to the list would be 
a problem, but it appeared to get buried under the Greencard Lawyer 
thread or some other such nonsense.

I also did vote yes because a pine group WAS needed to compliment 
comp.mail.elm, but I also posted my strong reservations about 
bi-directional porting of news postings.

I am seriously concerned that as the newgroup message propogates (it 
hasn't even gotten here yet), this list will become absolutely unbareable.

Some possible solutions:

A)  	remove porting
B)	Make porting one way, from list to group, but NOT from group to list
C)	Leave as is, but create a non-ported mailing list called pine-guru,
	pine-admin, pine-tech, or some such for people that deal with 
	suggestions for the future, system-based installation concerns, and 
	the like to talk on, and not deal with a huge number of FAQs that 
	will get asked every 48 hours or so (and note that making an FAQ 
	document won't help at all).
D)	Digestify pine-info.  Perhaps as a seperate mailing list called 
	pine-info-digest or something.  Same information, but in chunks 
	instead of individually.  I actually prefer individually, but 
	others are different.
E)	Everyone switches to elm (well, ok, that's not a good idea :-)

My vote, personally, is to create the seperate list for technical and 
development discussions (basically what the old list was) and to set up a 
digested distribution as well.  If the Lords of Pine aren't sure how to 
do the digesting, I'd suggest contacting the folx at queernet.org, as 
they have accomplished this using majordomo (perhaps majordomo can 
already inherently do it, I'm not sure).

saying "go away if you don't like it" is a poor attitude, IMHO.  If there 
is a problem that was unforseen or not considered very well, one is 
supposed to FIX it, not say "cope".  A bug is only a feature at 
Microsoft.  This is the real world :-)

For those that don't wanna mess with tr or sed or whatever other goffy 
things UNIX can do, here's the C source to ROT13:


---ROT13.c ---

#include <stdio.h>

main()   /* streamlined version of copy input to output */
{
	int c;

	while ((c =getchar()) !=EOF)
	   {
	   if( c>= 97 && c <= 109 )
	      c=c+13;
	   else if( c >= 110 && c <= 122 )
	      c=c-13;
	      else if( c >= 65 && c <= 77 )
		 c=c+13;
		 else if( c >= 78 && c <= 90 )
		    c=c-13;
		putchar(c);
		}
}

I did an archie search and got the above from the following site:

The way I set up nn (6.4.16 and on, all versions to present), it tracks the
environment variable EDITOR.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7BIT

Can someone please tell me whether it is possible to run Pine on machine 
"A" and then have it access an inbox on machine "B", without prompting 
for a username and password?  (Without Kerberizing Pine, that is.)

I created a .rhosts on machine "B" and specified machine "A" and my 
username on machine "A" in it.  (Both machines are running SunOS 4.1.3.)

When I try 'rlogin "B", I get prompted for a Password.  When I try 'rsh
"B"' I get "Permission denied."  Incidentally, the hosts.equiv file on "B" 
is empty.

Worse, trying to rlogin to "A" from anywhere results in the following:

login: illegal option -- r
                          usage: login [-fp] [username]
                                                       Connection closed.
Rsh to "A" works, but with the following warning:

stty: TCGETS: Operation not supported on socket

Thanks much.

  I know in the Post it says that PGP will NOT be intergrated into PINE 
3.90 , But i am looking for something ( like a script ) , that will let 
PINE 3.88 use PGP as an option . Currently i am looking for ANYTHING that 
will make the use of PGP with PINE 3.88 running under SUN 4.2 UNIX ,Not 
such a major task .

        So , if there is anyone out there with PGP that KNOWS who to use 
it with pine , Please E-mail me with an FTP location , Or any ideas where 
i should look for a script , program OR , hack !

        Thanks in advance .

I use TIN for NETNEWS.  However, I don't have control

other features that PINE has.  How can I get TIN to
talk with PINE?  Please EMAIL me the answer if possible.

Don't people ever read when they subscribe -- there is a seperate mailing
list called pine-annouce which sounds like exactly what you are looking for.

About things in the future, here is something which i'd like added to
pine. Compression. Compression of of sent-mail when the month changes and
another file is created -- as I hardly look at these file (but do from
time to time) I wouldn't mind waiting while pine decompressed the files
for me to look at and then recompressed them when i had finished.

Regards,

Anand.

	Funny, I heard him say "even text attachments".  I don't see

the pine team does....but I applaud them for having a clear and well

I don't have any problem with a pc. Are you using the control key, the
shift key and and the key that has the six on it together. I had a problem
understanding what ctrl-^ meant.

Subject: pine hangs when "Sending mail"
Message-Id: <1994Jun2.034946.10564@alw.nih.gov>
Date: Thu, 2 Jun 1994 03:49:46 GMT

Pine keeps hanging up, that is it fails to respond to further keystrokes,
once the "Sending mail" message appears; starting a second copy in another
window frees up the first, and the mail is sent.  It's very annoying behavior,
and we may give up on pine as a mail client and stick with the "elm" that
came with HP-UX.  It's a bit clunky, but at least it works.

Suggestions are welcome; we prefer pine, but can't accept this absurd file
"locking" behavior, and can't find anything explicit about it in the docs.

Help save a tree.

Apparently the gateway from pine-info to comp.mail.pine has broken in the
mail->news direction (I wondered why comp.mail.pine was drying up already ;). 

The gateway maintainer and myself are working to remedy this problem.  Sorry
about the inconvenience.

I agree with this viewpoint. I am finding the level of mail intolerable

At the beginning of each month pine asks about moving sent-mail folder to
folder signed with month . But then it asks the deletion of the old
sent-mail-month folder. I have all the old sent-mail
folder archived, so it is annoying to answer several times No. Would it be
possible implement an extension (Yes, No, All, Quit) for this question (
or others questions too?)

David L Miller (dlm@cac.washington.edu) babbled:

: Pine 3.90 will have an option to allow you to enter the alternate editor
: automatically when entering the body of the message, but the composer will
: still be used for the headers. 

I believe earlier versions may contain this feature as well. I use version
3.89, and I can across the following in my .pinerc:

# editor specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer.
# This is normally an alternative to Pine's internal composer (Pico)
editor=

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't a path to another editor here
switch it from Pico to the other editor?

Could someone please advise me...

1.  Are there any issues that will prevent a user switching between Pine
    3.89 and Pine 3.90? For example, .pinerc format, postponed message(s)
    filename(s), etc. 

    What are the implications (if any) of reverting to 3.89 after using 3.90? 

2.  Is it possible to configure Pine 3.90 to run in a "Pine 3.89
    compatibility mode", or gradually "switch on" the new features of 
    Pine 3.90 with the system-wide configuration file?


Thanks,

Dave

   Hello.

   We've just put PINE into our campus network but we have a problem each time
we want to use it.

   When we start PINE (PC-PINE) it asks us for the INBOX PATH where we want to
receive the messages and of course we write it. Then PINE asks for storing this
path and here comes the "bug": 
             If we respond 'Yes' PINE stores the path into the PINERC file.  

   Once the path has been stored then program runs correctly. Then we quit PINE
and then we try to begin a new session. Now PINERC has the inbox path and PINE
doesn't ask for it but !!it stops!!. In the screen we see "Opening INBOX" but
PINE doesn't open anything, keyboard get stuck and we have to reset our PC.
   
   Of course if we say 'No' PINE asks for the INBOX PATH and there's no
problems.

   The thing we want to avoid is writing the INBOX PATH each time we use PINE
but if we store that path into PINERC, PINE stops.

   Is there an answer to this problem?  Is it a bug in PINE? 

   HELP !!!!!!

BTW in answer to the original post if you ROT 13 twice
you get back the original encoded text (i.e. ROT 13
is it's own inverse).

That's why it's ROT 13 as opposed to ROT 12 etc.
                    --
13 = 26/2 you see...

It may sound like it, but it isn't. pine-announce takes care of the
"announcements" part of my list, but not anything else. I do read when I
subscribe, BTW, and I knew about pine-anounce, but it will not cover
everything I need to see. I need to be able to be part of discussions if
the situation arises, I need to have some insight as to what is being
considered and suggested, not just what will appear in the next release,
etc. Pine-announce will not do all that for me.

"Don't people ever read..." was a really nasty and unnecessary comment. I
could have responded to fully one-third of the posts to this list since
the newsgroup gatewaying began with that comment, but I didn't. I know
what I need, and pine-announce isn't it.

Understandable, but at least keep the mail list flowing to news.  I 
unsubscribed to the mail list after years on it and now read via the
newsgroup and I love it.

How does PINE determine the number of lines to use on a terminal screen?  
I have a user using NCSA Telnet, which allows you to set more lines on 
the screen than the basic 24.  He'd like to use 33 - is this doable??

Thanks,

Mike

Why not split the newsgroup into pine-info and pine-answers? Or have I 
missed some discussion?
BTW I don't seem to be able to find the pine newsgroup, where is it?

I am in strong agreement with the above suggestion (quoted at length
because I'm afraid the original will get lost in the tens of Pine messages
coming through every day): A separate technical mailing list which won't
be inundated with FFAQs would be quite useful for me (and, by extension,
the users on my system) without my mailbox being flooded with a couple
hundred messages every couple of days.  Keeping up with Pine/mail 
development and technical/configuration issues is quite useful to me, 
seeing the same novice questions over and over is not.

Since I can't really tell from the Subject lines which messages might be
useful and which are asking, for the umpteenth time, about a mail
filter program, I'm forced to wade through all these messages every
morning--it's become a real time sink in only a week. 

Creating a separate mailing list will allow the current gated list to 
continue in existence, since this gating seems of importance to a few 
people.  Meanwhile, I can get on with that part of my job that doesn't 
involve reading Pine FAQs, and I can always read the newsgroup should I 
feel so motivated.

I'm confused here.  The docs, online help, and context-sensitive help ALL
say that 1) MIME will be used for all attachments 2) The recipient MUST
HAVE MIME to read the attachments 3) If the recipient does not have a
MIME-compatible mailer, s/he may have difficulty extracting the message
_even_ _if_ _the_ _attachment_ _is_ _plain_ _text_!!!  If Pine doesn't 
suit your needs, well, there must be a dozen other mailers you could use.

All this bandwidth wasted because someone didn't RTFM ...   :-)

I agree.  Some input:

 How things are: 

   - PINE uses MIME encoding for attachments, even if they are ASCII text.  
   - UW has written PINE that way according to the requirements of their
     user community (i.e. the people that are paying them.)
   - ASCII text files can be included in any message via the control-R 
     command from the PICO editor.

 Three ways to deal with things as they are:

   - Use the control-R command from the PICO editor when you want to enclose
     an ASCII text file.

   - Pay UW to include your requirements in their specifications.

   - Use another package.

Seems pretty simple to me.  I prefer the first - PINE is a VERY nice 
package and it's priced right in my budget range.  My *THANKS* to the UW 
people for providing a very solid package at a VERY attractive price.  
AND for being as responsive as possible to a large crowd of critics... :{)

Just over-writing a .pinerc (pine configuration) file will not damage any 
folders.  They appear to disappear because various settings have been 
altered, though.  Recover or regenerate the .pinerc and everything should 
be OK.

	I agree with Robert that another solution is needed. I would vote 
for option c (Leave as is, but create a non-ported mailing list). Even in 
the early stages the flame wars are already starting and the spams and 
other garbage posts are sure to follow.

	Another suggestion for people using the newsgroup would be to 
maintain a FAQ. It is alot easier to tell someone to read item x in the 
FAQ than to use the bandwidth to explain to a 100 or so people how to 
place their signature in an email. If the good folks at Pine would like 
the help I will volunteer to coordinate the FAQ.

Help.

I use VersaTerm 5.0 for the Mac to connect to our mainframe to use Pine 
for UNIX. When printing out a long message from Pine, I always get 
garbled text to come out of my printer. It is never the same. Here is 
what I have tried to isolate the problem:

use Pine 3.87, no luck
use Pine 3.89, no luck
use a serial connection to a term. server, no luck
use the AppleTalk driver to connect via Ethernet, no luck
turn off print monitor, no luck

I will try it out with an ImageWriter to see if the problem persists. 
Does anyone have a clue? I'm sure someone out there is using a Mac, and 
someone should be using VersaTerm. Any help would be great. This has 
several of us in computer services stumped. I remember reading in the 
print screen that the attached-to-ansi had been tested with VersaTerm Pro. 
Am I missing some obvious setting? I would hate to switch to another 
terminal emulator, as all of the Mac people on campus use VersaTerm.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

Unfortunately, there is a bug in Pine 3.89 that can cause damage to a Pine
3.90 .pinerc file if you use certain new features. 

Pine 3.90 will look virtually identical to pine 3.89 for the novice user. 
The major new features will need to be explicitly enabled, either per-user
or globally.

Maybe it's because no one will anwser the question asked.






Personally, I have had no trouble telling from the Subject lines
what the posts are about.  

And until this group showed up in news, I didn't even know there was
a mailing list.

Pine doesn't do the terminal settings, your provider does.  I ran into 
this before.  I'm using a VT100 emulation, but I use a 50 line screen.  
It's probably in your login file somewhere, but with Unix you can use 
STTY to set the number of lines for the screen.  However, in most cases, 
you will also have to reset the envelope, using the SETENV command.  
Otherwise, you'd get 33, 50 or whatever lines from the centre of you 
screen (not very useful.)  Check the equivalent commands your system 
uses, but this method should work.

I thoroughly endorse Adam's comments. Our mail connection is via a 
UUCP dial up connection to Puerto Rico as we are not connected to the
Internet. We don't get news of any description so the only way to keep
abreast of PINE events is the mailing list.

The bi-directional gateway has not only increased my "junk mail" but
has significantly increased our telephone bill!

using Pine 3.07

I currently am maintaining a list of people who share a common interest
(in this case, modem games).  I created a list of addresses using the
add-to-list command, which places those names in the .addresslist? file in my
root directory.  To date, when I update, I simply mailed all of them using
pine...addressing the nickname of the maillist instead of individually. 
No problem right?. Well, when I get feedback from the group, everyone else
gets the email?  I guess that's because all the email addresses are
stuffed in the the "To: " line, right? I'm confused by it all!!!

I'd like to make the email I send to the group in a Digest form..that is,
only I can send to the whole group....only I get the feedback...get it?

I'd also like to automate received files with a certain subject so that
they are placed in a certain folder..can this be done?

thanks in advance!

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

	I have a question about long lines in mail received by pine that I
have not seen covered in any of the documentation I have looked at.
Sometimes I receive mail whose lines are much longer than the 80
characters or so displayed by pine. Pine displays the contents of the
received mail correctly (by line wrap I presume) but when I try to print
out the mail, our printer doesn't do the line wrap operation. Thus major
portions of the mail message are lost. The problem is that there appears
to be no way to determine in advance if this will be a problem since both
wrapped and non-wrapped mail messages appear the same when displayed by
pine. 

	Is there some way to force pine to print what is displayed by
inserting LF or LF/CR at the points where the line wrap occurs? This is a 
serious problem for me since I have to frequently clean up my disk space 
and assuming that the print operation works correctly has caused me to 
lose the contents of many mail messages.

	A related annoyance is the handling of wordwrap in forwarding or
replies. When the character > is inserted in a reply, for example, the
included message is not line wrapped in the pine display. In order to see
the entire encluded message, the reply has to be edited by hand and
additional > characters inserted. Is there any way to make this an
automatic operation? 

	I am using pine 3.89 on a SUN unix workstation and the precompiled 
binary pine program ftped from UW.

Hi,

Sorry if this has been brought up before, but does anyone know when the
bug that slides all text in a received mail note to the right in SunOS
Pine 3.89 will be fixed?  i.e.

If you send me:

  This
     sentence

it looks like:

This
sentence

when I receive it.

This is pretty frustrating when the text contains things like ASCII
diagrams...

Thanks!

Hi all,

I have just built the pine & pico package for the vms. Pico is running fine, but
Pine refuses to run and gives a short message that the host and domain names not
set. How can I set these variables?

Any help would be appreciated!

I have problems printing messages to my printer using the "L" command.

A one page message is no problem.  A two or more page message always
causes me a problem.  When it's part way through the printing, the text
starts to come garbled and then the computer freezes up.  I then have to
reboot my system.

Please E-mail any suggestions that you may have.

I use a 103x38 screen at home to call up via a modem, in my .login file I check 
to see if i'm calling from a modem and if I am I use the command:

stty cols 103 rows 38

I'm using gnu stty in this case, I think the normal equiv is

stty co# 103 row# 38

This address is OK, but questions and suggestions of general interest 
should probably go to pine-info@cac.washington.edu or the comp.mail.pine 
newsgroup (they are bidirectionally gatewayed together).

Word wrap turns out to be a much more difficult problem than it initially 
seems, especially with the internal representation used by pico.  The 
current behavior is clearly not very good, but we haven't found the time 
yet to do the major overhaul the word-wrap code needs.

Quite a bit of work has been done to optimize message generation for 
3.90, but I am sure there is still more that can be done...

Pine 3.89 checks for new mail every 2.5 minutes.  It used to be 30 
seconds, but our systems people complained about the system load of all 
of the new mail checks.  When IMAP4 gets implemented there will be a less 
resource intensive way to check for new mail, so maybe we can lower the 
interval again...

I suggest following basically the same procedure as for creating a list.  
i.e. someone post a RFD with a proposed charter, followed by a voting 
process.  Don't forget to find someone to setup/manage/moderate? the 
new list...

We have an FAQ mostly written , but many of the answers are 3.90-specific, so
we would like to hold off releasing it until the pine 3.90 release.  Outside
assistance is a possibility, send us mail at pine@cac.washington.edu to
discuss it further...

Do you know of anyone who may have a copy of pine ported over to a
Motorola Delta 8640 running sys V R3.2?  Pico seems to compile fine using
the sv4 port, but I can't get pine to do the same.  I appreciate any help
you may be able to offer.  Thanks.

Ed and Paul,
The name (meaning of the initials) was actually changed at an IETF 
working group mtg last year... It's now "Internet Message Access 
Protocol" to better illustrate that it isn't limited to mail, and it 
isn't just for interactive access.

IMAP2 is described in RFC-1176.
IMAP4 is still in draft form.  It's available from ftp.cac.washington.edu 
in the file /mail/latest-imap-draft  A new one is expected any day now.

Think of IMAP as a way of manipulating a remote mailbox as if it was 
local.  It allows you to get at your mail from multiple computers.
The mail server need not be Unix, but most are.  (There is also an IMAP 
server for VMS.)

Can anyone suggest a good fax gateway that would work with pine/unix mail.
 Our company uses VSIFAX to send faxes out, but would like to be able to
use the pine mail interface to pipe to it.  Please e-mail any suggestions.
 Thanks in advance.

I attempted this some time ago, but was unable to get the c-client to 
compile, and it seemed that considerable effort was required to get 
around this.  I gave up until the BOS was upgraded to SVR4.0, after which 
Pine compiled without too much fuss.

Or any other kind of machine.  This OpenVMS VAX system, for example.  Pine
likes it just fine.

Sorry, but I get ticked off when I see someone use "Unix machine" as a synonym
for "computer".

IMAP2 is specified in RFC 1176.

Another suggestion that I did not see in Jeff Stern's initial message is
having incoming messages saved to predefined group-based folders; in other
words, allow the user to define groups of addresses that should be saved to
a single folder.  

I currently use procmail to intelligently filter my mail into a bunch of
inboxes, which are defined in my .pinerc.  After reading the messages in
pine, however, the best I can do is save by name, which ends up creating
many more folders than I'd like.  I end up running a weekly script that
combs through all my by-name folders and combines user groups into subject
based folders.

It would be handy if I could define a group of addresses in my .pinerc and
map them all to a single save folder, so that when I press "s" in a message
from one of the defined addresses, the default save folder is as I have
defined it (ie: "co-workers", "personal", "ieee-discussion", etc).

Are there any plans to implement such a feature?  I love Pine as it is, but
this would make things a lot easier for me!

>> 	I LOVE PINE!!!!  GOOD JOB FOLKS!!!!

Agreed!

I really like the address book feature of pine.  I think it really
differentiates itself from many other mailers with this feature.

When I receive a note, is there any automated way to add the reply
address to my address book - either while reading a message or 
from the reply composition screen?  Or is the only way to go to
the address book menu and add it?  Thanks ...

I am the Systems Administrater where I work ,and I am trying to install 
pine and pico at our site, and I have the following problems and questions:

We use AIX 3.1. When I try to compile pine for AIX (a32), I get multiple 
errors and no bin files were created. I eventually got pico to compile 
when I compiled it for bsd, but this did not work for pine. How can I 
compile for AIX 3.1? It does not look likely that we will be upgrading to 
3.2 anytime soon, although that is planned for 'sometime down the road' 
(I don't control these decisions!), and I would like to get this running 
as soon as possible, as one of my projects is to get an email system 
running (at the lowest possible cost, of course).

We use Televideo 950 and 955 terminals and terminal emulation on PCs. 
Pico does not seem to recognize the TVI control keys and reverse video 
codes. I can set my term type to VT100, and change my emulation mode to 
VT100 on my PC, and that works fine, but I have to change back and forth, 
as all of our in-house software is set to work with TVI terminals. Most 
users here have only TVI terminals, and so that is not an option for 
them, anyway. Is there a TVI configuration option for pico? I have not been 
able to find any mention of this in the documentation, just for pine 
(which won't compile, so if it shares config files with pine, is there a 
way around it?)

Any help would be greatly appreciated. The email address that this was 
sent from is my personal address, and is the best one to respond to. (I 
haven't got our in-house email system up & running yet!)

Thanks!

I believe I had the same problem here. The solution is simple, you only
need to define _tzname with the following line:

  extern char *_tzname[2];

You should also change the gettimeofday in the same code area to the
following if it isn't already (I can't remember if I changed it or if it 
was already there):

  BSDgettimeofday (&tv,&tz);    /* get time and timezone poop */

	I noticed Pine has a way of sorting mail coming from specific 
users (correct me if I'm wrong tho...), but now this:  I receive mail 
from different people (From: field), but same Subject: field.  Is there a 
way I can let Pine sort my arrived mail into a separate mail folder, 
other than INBOX, by looking at it's Subject: line?

Subject: Does pine use the sum command?
Date: 3 Jun 1994 22:47:41 GMT
Message-Id: <2sobud$ggv@giga.bga.com>

We use pine 3.89 on our Internet system.  I don't know what flavor
of unix it runs (something shareware I think), but when I tried to
uuencode a file via pine, I got a failure because pine couldn't 
find the "sum" command.  

After speaking to the sysadmin, he said that "sum" command had 
been superseded by the "cksum" command on the newer versions of
(BSD??) our unix.  Anyway, I just wanted to toss that out in
case it can be dealt with in a later pine release.  

I think I do have a workaround.

I don't know if this has been mentioned but...

I would like to be able to use pine with the left and right arrow
keys as well as the up and down keys.  For example, when I'm reading
a message and I want to go back to the index level, it feels more
intuitive to press LEFT than 'I'.

In the same way, to read a message from index level I'd prefer to
move up and down with the arrows to get to the message I'm interested
in and press RIGHT to view it rather than ENTER.

I belive this would be faster and easier to use.  There would be less
keystrokes to learn, especially if every level worked like this
(eg the main menu).

	Just hit 'T' -- 'Take Address'. You'll then be prompted for any
modifications you might want to make to the full name and E-mail address
(Pine giving defaults from the From: field of the message).

Subject: ADDRESS IN DISTRIBUTION LIST
Message-Id: <billwillCquCpF.7qD@netcom.com>
Date: Fri, 3 Jun 1994 21:51:15 GMT

  (1) The Pine documentation says that one may use the following format 
for an entry in the Address Book: 

                       John Doe <jdoe@fritcom.com>

  But when I try to include such an entry in a Distribution List, I get a 
message like, "Spaces not permitted within quotes," or some such.

  May one include real names in a Distribution List entry?

  (2) When I send EMail to a Distribution List, is it necessary to strip 
off the top entry of the list and place it on the "To:" line? Or may one 
leave the "To:" line empty, and simply send the message with all the 
Distribution List entries included in either "cc:" or "Bcc:"?

  Thanks in advance for your help,

                           -- Bill Smithers

Liam,
We will investigate the feasibility of using L/R arrow keys when we 
implement hierarchy support later this year.  (We need some new features 
coming with IMAP4 before we can do that, however.)

When I want to forward or reply-via-mail to messages in TIN, I just send 
them to myself and use PINE to edit and send the mail message.  In 
addition to being saved in 'sent-mail', I also get the power of the 
addressbook and other features.

I also know alot of other people that would be interested in this
(sorry if it's been asked a billion times before).

I also wouldn't mind a pine specific receipt acknowldgement (ie I 
don't care if only pine users will send auto receipt acknowledgement),
but I can accept I might have to ad that one myself.

thanks,

There is a 3.89 bug, but it isn't anything to get too worried about.  If
you use a 3.90 variable that is a list but wasn't a list before, and you
have more than one item in that list, the items after the first will be
deleted if you run 3.89 or before again.  This same bug has existed in 
previous versions and would have nailed you if you switched between 
versions when we added a new list variable.  Only difference here is that 
we've added more list variables than usual, so it is more likely to happen.

The address book format is simple:

for a single alias

<nickname> TAB <full name> TAB <address>    for example
slh TAB Hubert, Steve TAB hubert@cac.washington.edu

The full name field can be either Hubert, Steve or Steve Hubert, but it 
sorts better if you use Hubert, Steve.

For a list the format is

<nickname> TAB <full name of list> TAB (addr1, addr2,
    addr3, addr4, addr5)
(Spaces at the beginning of a line are continuation lines, but only for 
lists.  That is, you can't break anywhere else.  This is relaxed in 3.90 
and there will be a couple new fields after the address field.)

For example,

alist TAB This is the A List TAB (slh, joe@cac.washington.edu,
    someotherlist, someothernickname,
    Fred Flintstone <fred@bedrock.net>)

Sorry, but no help from me on how to get your list into this format.

You can't get them in there using Pine, but if you edit your addressbook 
by hand and put them in it will work.  Make sure you don't put any tabs 
in there.  3.90 will allow you to add them instead of complaining about 
the spaces.

Pine doesn't require you to have a To.  As long as your message is going 
somewhere it's happy.  There are no doubt some mailers that won't like it 
if you don't have any To's or cc's at all.

Hmmm... I'm not sure about that. How about: 

setenv TERM vt100

or whatever.

Hear, Hear!

And contrary to the popular opinion of SOME people on this newsgroup, 
conversion of a file from 7-bit ascii to Base64 changes it to a format 
that is not directly readable.  As far as I am concerned, that is 
encryption as surely as ROT-13 is.  The text must be translated out of 
Base64 to be readable, therefore it is effectively encrypted.

	A friend writes me that he accidentally deleted an E-mail from me.
A copy is there in the sent-mail file. What is the easiest way to 
retrieve it into a new letter?  Can it be done without calling up the 
file and editing out the other letters? Can sent-mail be set up as a 
directory so that each letter becomes a file instead of being appended to 
one file?
	thanks.
Michael

	Uh, how about just going to that mail in your sent-mail folder and
'F'orwarding it? :)

I'm using pine 3.05, what works for me is to put the nickname for the list
in the Bcc field instead of the address field. This way, subscribers do
not get to see the whole mailing list.

I would like to do something similar. I keep folders sorted on people's
names. I'd like to save their mail in their personal folder, and to 
automatically save my mail to them there.

It happened to me when I was reading a message, pressed D to
delete it and then Q to quit. When pine asked "Expunge..." I
pressed an arrow key by mistake and got the above message.

Message-Id: <2sqjp5$smc@freenet3.scri.fsu.edu>

Apologies if I've posted this to the group before.  The last few days are 
a blur.

I'm helping put together online docs for new users on the Vancouver 
Freenet.  We're going to be opening to the public rsn and I'm in a bit of 
a panic.  I'm pretty sure this is a FAQ, but between Tallahasee just 
having a hard drive crash and me not knowing my way around, I can't find it.

Any pointers to Pico docs would be most appreciated.

Lately I have been unable to successfully transfer messages from Pine to

I usually use <E> to export a message to the root directory.  I then 
attempt to download them to my PC.  I have tried sz -a filename, and
sz -b filename... Neither seems to work.  The status screen shows the 
downloading begins but then gets stuck and is eventually timed out.

Please tell me what I could do differently in order to succeed in 
downloading...

The following worked for me, I hope it works for you!

If you are on a UNIX system, and you have accessed your mainframe

instead accessing your system with RLOGIN, instead of TELNET. At

This is due to the fact that the escape characters for telnet will
conflict with the escape characters for the Z-modem protocol causing the
file transfer to abort or crash. Switching to rlogin will remedy this
problem since it has different escape characters.

Hi all,
	Is there any way to pop mail from another account using pine?  If 
not now, are there any plans to implement pop3 support?  I have a couple of 
users that dial into a Unix system but receive mail on our Novell server 
using Mercury.  Mercury has a pop3 server and these users would like to be 
able to get their mail from the Novell server.  Any ideas would be helpful.

Here ya go.. a method to pgp outgoing mail with pine.  Change your .pinerc
so the line that looks like:

# Editor to use in place of Pine's internalcomposer, Pico 
editor=

reads this way..

editor=mkpgp

Now create a file called mkpgp that contains the following:
[begin mkpgp (note: do not include this line)]

#!/bin/sh
# schake@cs.sandia.gov, May 28 1994
# revised jmallin@umich.edu, May 31 1994
clear
echo ''
echo 'PGP and PINE !!! written by schake@cs.sandia.gov and jmallin@umich.edu'
echo ''
echo 'Enter public key of recipient or return <CR> to sign only'
read action
case $action in
    ?*)
	pgp -asew "$1" "$action";;
    *)
	pgp -satw +clearsig=on "$1";;
esac
mv "$1.asc" "$1"
[end mkpgp (do not include this line)]

Next, issue the command:

chmod +x mkpgp

Now you should be setup.  Just use pine as usual.  Begin composing a 
message and type the entire message.  When you are done do not ^X.  
First, type ^_ to execute the mkpgp script (your alternate editor) then you 
can ^X and send after you return to pine.  mkpgp should allow you to 
specify a recipient's public key or just hit return to sign the message.

Enjoy.

Now if someone could come up with something to somehow decrypt the 
messages, I'll be all set.. ;)

Hi.  We have installed pine 3.87 at my site and we like it very much.  The problem I have is we have an older e-mail program (Edge Office) which cannot handle replies to the from headers pine supplies.  For example a message from me would be:

	From: Ray Williams 697-9300 <rpwillia@pentagon-emh6.army.mil>

Edge will choke on "Ray" stating there is no such user.  As I said Edge is a few years old and out of date.  Personally we recommended everybody switch to pine, but this is the U.S. Gov and they tend to like to be backward so I need to stop the autoexpansion if at least until they get with the program.  TIA Ray

Pico itself is not responsible for this.  Pico is just an editor.  The
news program adds the signature to the bottom of whatever comes out of
the editor.  Pine can put the signature anywhere it wants because the
editor is built in.

Strictly speaking, Pine's behavior regarding signatures is not
"wrong".  The time-honored convention on USENET is to include the
original message (preferably edited) followed by the reply followed by
the signature.  The authors of Pine want to promote a different
convention which is to start the message with the reply followed by the
signature followed by the original message.  My personal prefence is to
put the original message first, but only if you are going to delete all
but the most relevant portions.  Given the tendency of many people to
not do the appropriate editing, Pine's behavior relieves me of having
to read the original message in its entirity if I don't want to.

You may try the kermit tools instead of sz.  It works for me.

If you don't concern about addressbooks and a few other things specific 
to pine, you may

	setenv VISUAL pico

to use PICO instead.

Subject: Saving outgoing messages question
Date: 6 Jun 1994 03:11:51 GMT
Message-Id: <2su45n$lgj@news.bu.edu>


I would like to save outgoing messages to individual files.
For example, say I write a message to 'Pam', I would like it
to be saved in filename 'Pam'.  Currently, all outgoing messages
are being saved in the same file.  What must I do to have this
functionality?

Thanks,
ROB

When you compose a message, hit ctl-r which will reveal rich header.  You 
will see a field marked

Fcc: 

which is the folder carbon copy, that is, the place where your copy of 
the message you are typing is stored.  It is in your default folder, 
named "sent", "out-messages", or "outmail" (in my case).  Hit ctl-k to 
erase the line and type in the name of the folder where you would like it 
to be stored (I normally use my addressbook alias name for the person I 
am addressing as folder names).  I don't believe current versions of pine 
permit this to be done automatically, as elm, for instance, allows.  I 
hope this will become a feature of subsequent versions of pine, and has 
been discussed in some length on this group.

I do, with great satisfaction.  "vi" is a pain, "emacs" is a chore 
(albeit, I have great feelings of guilt for not taking the time to master 
emacs).  Edit your .cshrc to include the line pcfong suggests below.  
Invoke the pico editor to edit your .cshrc by typing 

pico .cshrc (or whatever shell you are using, e.g., .tshrc)

Uhhh, in pine all you have to do is 'r' for reply and then 'y' to include
the original message.  Are you even using pine?

I have a problem printing using the Y command--somehow Pine
produces "pages" that are about 3 lines too long.  If I print
a message, I get one full page of print, one page of 3 lines,
then a full page, then 3 lines, etc., until the end of the message.

Any ideas on what causes this or how to stop it?

Perhaps the poster wanted to send the quote to somebody else? A partial

	Well then, just hit 'r' for reply, but change the To: address.

	Um, the only way I can think to do this is to hit R to reply to
the first message, postpone it, hit R to reply to the second message, then
hit ^R and incorporate mail/postponed-mail into the second reply. I'm sure
there isn't an easy way of doing this! That's really awkward, I know, but
it's all I can think of.

Message-Id: <d93rkr.770940810@txfs1.hfb.se>
Date: Mon, 6 Jun 1994 22:13:30 GMT

I noted that Pine changes the permissions of the .addressbok file (UNIX!)

As I don't want anybody else to see who I am coresponding with, I changed the permission of the .addressbook file to -rw------- and thought that it would be safe... BUT when I added a new item in the Addresbook from within Pine, Pine CHANGED the permission of the .addressbok file back to -rw-r--r--!!!

Another thing is that I would like a way to change the quotation mark to something else, is this posible??? 

>From the simple ">" to whatever I want... ie the initials from the quoted person or something!!

And I would like to be able to manually Quote a text block... Maybe just mark a block and then get it all indented with a quote mark infront!!

I ftp'd the AIX binary version of Pico from ftp.cac.washington.edu.  It works 
great except I would like to disable wordwrap for reports that are 132 columns 
wide.  Is this possible???

Date: Tue, 7 Jun 1994 01:55:31 GMT

I have a need to add a couple extra headers to messages being posted with 
Pine.  Where in the source code (or is it done there) can I add these 
headers?  I tried to add them in first lines of the body, but as 
suspected they didn't take as they should have.  

Any ideas?

  ==========================================================================

  The "blind" cc: command -- Bcc: -- is designed to accomplish this.

  When your cursor is in the header, hit <Ctrl>R; Bcc: will appear in the 
header. Type in after this the addresses of all recipients who are to get 
a copy but not know anyone else had gotten one. Separate the entries with 
commas, but no spaces.

  you could use emacs to edit the file.. first, load the file, then type
Meta-x... type 'replace' (without quotes) and enter, you'll see a dash
show, then type 'string'....and hit enter.. it'll ask you what to
replace, type Ctrl-q and then Ctrl-M then enter.  After that, it'll ask
you what to replace it with, just hit enter... you'll then see all the ^Ms
changed to nothing...... (make sure you do this from the top of the doc so
that you don't have to repeatedely do it...

Not to seem, ungrateful for this response, but is there any other way.  
With any list more than a few names long, this would be very tedious, indeed.

I tried this, and when I followup or reply to a post, the status line at

: Pico itself is not responsible for this.  Pico is just an editor.  The

: editor is built in.

So how does one have pine put the signature at the end?

My solution to this is to move the .addressbook file into my Mail
directory and then edit .pinerc and make the address-book line say:

address-book=Mail/.addressbook

As long as your Mail directory has permissions drwx------ (700) then
no-one can read your address book file.


As for the rest of your questions, I want those features too.

Get one of the programs from comp.sources.unix that allows one to attach a
program to a named pipe.  People frequently do this for .plan to launch a
fingerback program.  Some of the versions allow any program to attach to any
named pipe.

Pine 3.90 will support POP3, at least in UNIX Pine.  PC Pine is less certain.

The syntax for a mailbox name will be:	{server/pop3}
You will not be allowed to use any folder name other than INBOX with POP3, due
to POP3's limitations.  There are many other limitations in POP3 that will
limit what you can do with a POP3 folder from Pine.  Also, POP3 is noticably
slower than IMAP.

I have a different problem with tin/pine.  When I try to use tin to MAIL
a message to someone, it doesn't like it.  Apparently tin tries to send
the message by saying "pine user@site -s subject < tmp.sndxxxx"
Pine can't accept the "<" input.

Any suggestions on what I'm doing wrong?

Create a mailing list first in your addressbook. You can enter the nickname of

I am running Pine v3.89 and every time I run it a file .pine-debug? is 
created.  Is there anyway to prevent this file from being created, or do
I have to spend my days deleting these files as long as I use this version
of pine.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Does anyone know how to create a blinking/flashing signature?  I heard that
it has something to do with editing your .pinerc file.  Is that corrrect?
Any info on this is appreciated.  Thanks in advance...

the option "-d#" is just for that...  if you want NO .pine-debug# files
created, run pine with the flag '-d0' (e.g. pine -d0).  Or if you want
lots of detail ... run '-d8' (e.g. pine -d8) ... default setting is at
'2'.

   I have a seek and destroy cron job that runs every night to find and delete
these files (core too).  I haven't looked but I would hope that there is and
option to turn these things off somewhere?  Maybe one of the compile options?

Pine only keeps the last four .pine-debug? files.  If you want to turn
them off completely, run Pine with the "-d0" command line option.

Mark,
This is a bit premature... Although a pop3 driver is now available in the
c-client libraries, it is too soon to say whether it will be included in
Pine 3.90 build by default, since there is still work to be done in Pine
code to make this work the way most people would expect.

Well from what I know if your computer has an ansi driver installed
you can do the following



"[31;1;5m flash!!! [0m"

now if you just see the code and no flashing colors it might be:
1. your system does not have ansi installed 
2. your system does not accept the ^[ (escape) chars

btw the code looks like
"^[[31;1;5m flashh!!! ^[[0m"

if your account does not support ^[ (it turns it into [_ ) like my school 
account does not, I was told that you could try using a good text editor to 
give you a CHR$(27) signal instead of a ^[ character. I haven't tried this
yet so we'll see.

btw... I had asked about whether sending blinking color post was in line
with netettiquette mainly because such thing like that are prohibited by
most muds and frown upon on IRC because it may mess up someone's screen.
A simple crtl l will stop this however. As far as I can tell this issue
has not been discussed as far as posts are concerned.

Another problem is that having your ansi driver installed some unscruplous 
individuals may pass along ANSI bombs where by a character's function has 
been changed to a command to the computer to format the drive.  

IF anyone else has anything more to contribute to this discussion or correct
or expand upon what I said, please do!

I have the same concern on the dial-up Internet provider I use. By default
on this system, file permissions are "read only" for all users on every
file in my home directory. So I changed the permissions of my home
directory to "no read" via 'chmod og-r ~kevint'. This *seems* to work as
it *should* prevent other users (other than root obviously) from doing a
'cd' to my home directory ('permission denied' message). This would
prevent them from viewing any files that have a 'read only' permission in 
my home directory since other users would not be able to cd to my directory.

Comments from anybody on this workaround??

Quick question. Whatever I do, I don't seem to be able to configure
PC-pine 3.89 to use an editor other than pico. I've set my new "editor" in
pinerc, and also added "enable-alternative-editor-cmd" to my "feature-list".
Yet ^_ does nothing. Is this a non-existent function, or am I missing 
something?

I goofed on the above - I should said to change the permission on my home
directory via "chmod o-x ~kevint". This denies *execute* permission to
others which is what will prevent them from "cd"ing to your directories
and looking at stuff they have no right to look at. Changing your home
directory permissions to deny read access will *not* prevent others from
"cat"ing files in that directory that have the "r" permission set 
for "others". 

Thanks to those who pointed out my mistake!

You will *never* be able to count on embedded characters to express some
special format in your .sig or any other text.  ANSI sequences are not
necessarily used to drive UNIX type screens (the largest Pine user
community, I suspect) nor are they likely to work on a PC even if it has
an ANSI Screen Driver in place.

Not everyone use PINE for their Mail User Agent (MUA), and MUA's tend to
present data as data -- which means that unless your embedded control
sequences just happen to mean something to the screen native to the
viewer's machine you will be wasting your time.  Even some MUA's on
ASCII type machines (PC's included) will actually strip the high bit
from  characters in text files to prevent just such things as unwanted
screen diddling due to embedded escape codes.

If you can mail out into netland, then your e-mail may be viewed by any
of a large number of MUA's on a large variety of machines.  For example,
your e-mail to this list was read, and this reply is being written, on
an IBM ES/9000 MainFrame running the VM/ESA/CMS Operating System -- an
EBCDIC Character System!  Your ASCII control codes mean nothing to a
3270-type terminal which not only uses EBCDIC characters, it does not
do screen addressing and formatting with plain escape sequences just
written to the display -- even in EBCDIC.  You gotta do some serious
programming to format a 3270 device.
My MUA:  'MailBook' written mostly in Rexx driving the CMS XEDIT
environment -- MailBook by Richard A. Schafer of Texas' Rice University

Best Bet: Make your .sig as attractive as you can with printable
characters and don't depend on any special addressing and formatting
stuff to work.  That way everybody will see the same nice signature for
you.

If it is possible to have a Bcc: field then that is the way to do it.
However, this assumes that I know what Bcc actually does... I think
there might be a way to do it by fiddling with you .pinerc though.

  In Pine Technical Notes,

          When reading incoming email, Pine  allows  all
          character  sets to pass through.  Pine doesn't
          actually display  the  characters  but  simply
          passes  them  through;  it is up to the actual
          display device to show the characters correct-
          ly.
		  
  I am using pine for reading Japanese mail. There is no problem.
But, writing japanese mail, there are many problems for us.  Because,
we use 8-bit 2 byte characters.

How can I create a "secure" pico?

I'd like to be able to disable file browsing and/or directory changing.
(This is for a *nix BBS program using pico as the fullscreen editor)

I'd also like to be able to have the file broswer start in the directory
that it's started in, rather than the "home" directory of the user.
Is this eaily done?

Answers pointing to the right spots in the source will be gratefully
received. I'm somewhat of a c neophyte. :-)


It'd be really great if these were command line options BTW :-)

Hi,

How can I get Pine/Pico to only use 24 lines of the display? It appears not
to user the $LINES variable, and although on Linux I can do an "stty rows
24" we also use it on SCO 3.2.4.0 which doesn't support this rows arg.

Thanks in advance.

-Barry

Pine was designed with the assumption that terminals are at least 80
columns wide.  In practice, it can handle down to about 70 columns without
degradation, but narrower than that you start losing text off the menus
and such.  At 40 columns, there is alot that Pine does not have room to 
display...

I'll second this request!

On another topic.... You can press tab repeatedly to go through your new
messages in your inbox, and then at the end of the folder you are asked
"View next folder XXX? (y/n/^C)?"  Does anyone else wish they could keep
hitting tab to skip over the incoming folders, as opposed to pressing
(Y/N/^C)?  (Keep in mind this is only if you have setup additional
incoming folders :)

Message-Id: <2t5041$al0@news.service.uci.edu>

I have a .signature file in my directory, thus Pine includes this file
whenever I compose a message.  However, when I sent a message to someone
with a .com address (my wife's company), she did not receive the .signature
part, only the body of the message, followed by a single line (_______).
On the other hand, when I experimented with sending a message to myself on
my America OnLine account (also a .com addres), the .signature portion of the
file _was_ included.  What's up with this?

Thanks in advance,
Ed

I'm no pine guru but what I do when pine starts up is type 'C'
to compose a leter, enter the adress, subject etc. and then position
the cursor in the area where you would compose the body of the 
message with pico. At this point I issue a '^_' command and voila
my editor of choice is called. Hope this helps.

It's not within the realm of pine, but there are two main programs on the 
'Net that do this sort of job:

 - Randsig: you can make it periodically pick a random sig from a file and
place it in .signature
 - Sigcycle: goes through a file of 'one-liners' (that can be as many lines
as you'd like...) each time it's called on, and can add a prefix and a 
suffix (each one line) around that sig. Mine, for example, is one of these; 
I have a sigcycle running periodically with my fave quips in a file, and
then I have sigcycle configured to put a line with my name and address above
the sig and a line with my home-page url after it. Sigs in the file can be
separated by anything, and I use '---' at the begining of a line.

Just email me if you're interested, or grab it from my home page.

Subject: Outgoing Mail Problem
Date: 8 Jun 1994 19:09:23 GMT
Message-Id: <2t5513$ooq@coranto.ucs.mun.ca>


On several occasions when I go into Pine I get a message asking if I want
to "Delete" or "Move" outgoing mail for May.  I've handled this message
without any complications many times before but now no matter what I do
the message keeps re-appearing.  There have been times when I've said
"Yes" to deleting May's "sent-mail" but what gets deleted is the sent mail
up to this date in June.

Is anyone else having this problem?  Does someone know the solution?

At the present time, Pine's support of East Asian character sets is very
limited.  Pine knows enough to pass the ESCAPE, SI, and SO characters used by
Japanese, Korean, and Chinese encodings.  But Pine is otherwise not aware of
multi-byte character sets.

The consequence is that, with some problems, you can read messages which use
East Asian characters with Pine, but it is difficult to send messages with
East Asian characters from Pine.

We are aware of these problems, and we have discussed them in our meetings.
I expect that we will solve these problems in a future version of Pine, but at
the present time it is not possible to say when this will happen.  There are
many pressing tasks on the Pine team's ``to-do'' list which appear to be of
greater importance.

It would help if we hear from users who wish to use Pine with East Asian
languages.  We really don't know how large the community is.  Obviously, we
have to dedicate our resources to projects that will be of benefit to large
numbers of users.

	And what's even worse is that we get to see them on the newsgroup,
as well. Could you put some kind of a filter in there, so that any mail
which contains just 'unsubscribe' on a line at the beginning of the mail
doesn't get through? And, maybe, even automate a reply to tell people
where they should send mail to to unsubscribe to the list.

	Why? You just enter the nicknames the way you do in the To:

    I admit that I know nothing about Japanese text via computer, but
here are some things that might be helpful:

    In order to show non-ASCII text in a mail message header, such as
the Subject: line, you must encode the header lines according to (I
think it's) RFC1522.  Pine does not yet convert encoded header lines to
non-ASCII text, but this feature will be provided soon, though not in
Pine3.90.  I'm not sure whether Pine will know how to generate correct
headers for multi-byte languages.

    Pine's internal composer editor is designed for single-byte input.
As I don't know how you would write your Japanese, I can only suggest
making use of an alternate editor within Pine which generates the correct
multi-byte characters.  Perhaps the multi-lingual Emacs, or you probably
have other editors which do this.  Make sure the file written by this
editor makes use of the character set encoding in your .pinerc, so that
messages are tagged with the correct encoding.  You invoke the alternate
editor within Pine with the ^_ command, and it is set within the .pinerc
configuration file.  Pine3.90, to be released in a few weeks, will allow
you to make use of this alternate editor for the message body all the
time, which is useful for those languages which do not make use of the
normal ASCII-based keyboard layout.  (My experience is with Czech and
Slovak, which sometimes use two keystrokes to generate a single letter.)

    Again, I really don't know what I'm talking about with respect to
Japanese, but Pine should permit you to make use of local tools, such
as alternate customized editors, which would support any language.
If anyone who knows better wishes to correct me, please do so...

  We can't do by original-pine.  We are doing enable writing in Japanese by 
pine.  Now, I can read & write mail in Japanese by Pine.  But it does't work 
well. So I'm hacking now.

  Sometime in Japanese mail, its subject is meime-encoded Japanese.

Summary: Difficulties with pine as newsreader

I wonder if anyone can shed any light on this one.  I run pine 3.89, the 
Linux binary for which I grabbed from ftp.cac.washington.edu.  It ran 
straight away without any difficulty at all.  

Just recently I decided to try pine as a newsreader, and made the 
necessary entry in .pinerc.  This works fine too, except.... take a look 
at the following:

The entries after apana.lists.mail.pine, starting from the single dot, are 
effectively what you get if you do a ls -a on my /home/ftp directory.  
You can't read them, of course, or in fact do anything with them.

So can anyone tell me what the hell they're doing there, and how I might 
get rid of them?

TIA

Warwick Hockley -

Are you sure that you ``can't read [the entries from ~ftp that are listed in
the News collection], or in fact do anything with them''?

You should be able to open any of these names that point to files, as if they
were one-message mailboxes.

The functionality of opening files in ~ftp as newsgroups is something that
will change in future versions of Pine, after Pine supports IMAP4.  So you're
seeing a temporary artifact of an idea that isn't going to be in future
versions.

Subject: Problem with attachments
Date: 9 Jun 1994 10:45:35 GMT
Message-Id: <2t6rsf$g7n@lyra.csx.cam.ac.uk>

I have a problem with plain-text attachements.  I've got saved copies of several
messages I've sent from pine which are short cover notes with the main text in an
attachment.  When I view the messages, pine won't show me the attachment: it says
"don't know how to display attachment format Application/OCTET-STREAM".

I didn't knowingly tell it to use that format.  I know that pine encodes all
attachments, even 7-bit ASCII text, but I'd expect it to be able to decode anything
that it can encode!  I note that pine can save the attachment to file even though it
can't display it.

Is this behaviour a bug?  Can I get a better attachment format somehow?  Do I maybe
have to set some option in .pinerc?

Thanks in advance for any help

	When a composed message is postponed, it appears in the
folder list; however, it is not really in a folder, and must be
retreived by using C)ompose again.

	Wouldn't it be better if it really did go into a folder? --
then, there could be more than one postponed message at a time.

I've heard some word of an anonymous mailer that resends mail you send to 
the receiver without any way for the reciever to know who sent it.  Is 
there such a thing and how does does one use it?  Fell free to email me 
(anonymously if you wish.)

Guy,
There was a bug in earlier versions of Pine such that text attachments 
were not typed as TEXT.  So the solution is to ask the sender to upgrade.

If you and the sender are already running a contemporary version (e.g.
3.89) then something else is going on, and we need more data.

	Subject: Re: Kanji/Hanzi in pine? 

	At the present time, Pine's support of East Asian character sets is very
	limited.  Pine knows enough to pass the ESCAPE, SI, and SO characters used by
	Japanese, Korean, and Chinese encodings.  But Pine is otherwise not aware of
	multi-byte character sets.

	The consequence is that, with some problems, you can read messages which use
	East Asian characters with Pine, but it is difficult to send messages with
	East Asian characters from Pine.

	We are aware of these problems, and we have discussed them in our meetings.
	I expect that we will solve these problems in a future version of Pine, but at
	the present time it is not possible to say when this will happen.  There are
	many pressing tasks on the Pine team's ``to-do'' list which appear to be of
	greater importance.

	It would help if we hear from users who wish to use Pine with East Asian
	languages.  We really don't know how large the community is.  Obviously, we
	have to dedicate our resources to projects that will be of benefit to large
	numbers of users.

Subject: Line Wrapping in Pine
Date: 9 Jun 1994 10:56:43 -0500
Message-Id: <Pine.3.05.9406090951.A40108-9100000@cpu.us.dynix.com>

Can anyone tell me if there's a way to turn off line wrapping in Pine?  I
want to send a long command to a list server, and Pine causes the command
to wrap in the middle.  As a result, the server interprets the message as
two bad commands.

You are welcome to post responses to the newsgroups, but I would also
appreciate personal email, since I'm currently having problems with my
news reader.

Thanks.

How do I make pine use ~/Mail rather than ~/mail?

p.s. The man page implies it is hard wired.  Please say it isn't so!

Subject: Where does Pine get local user info?
Date: 9 Jun 1994 15:34:26 GMT
Message-Id: <2t7cq2$as7@savvy2>


Just curious... But if I send mail to someone on my local machine by 
typing just the username (without and machine name info) Pine 
automatically adds the machine name & the host name to the mailing 
address.  ie, if I type:

To:  Phil

Pine displays:

To: Phil@savvy1.savvy.com


Where is this information obtained from??  I don't mind the fact that it 
adds the domain name, but it is unnecessary for the machine name to be 
appended... ie:

To: Phil@savvy.com

is the desired format for our domain.  Any ideas how I can eliminate the 
machine name from being automatically added??  I compiled Pine awhile 
ago, so I forgot if this is a configuration option.

Thanks

If you run pine with the "-z" command line option or put enable-suspend 
on the feature-list in your .pinerc file, you use ^Z to suspend the 
current Pine session.  Pico also supports the "-z" option.

MIME does not support uuencode, and Pine does not currently support any 
of the ad-hoc extensions floating around for it.  Pine 3.90 will have 
more flexibility in decoding uuencoded attachments...

Posting will be supported in Pine 3.90, which should be available in a 
few weeks.

PC-Pine will prompt for username/password when you open a connection to
the IMAP server.  We strongly recommend that you connect via IMAP directly
to the server that actually stores your folders rather than using NFS,
especially for your INBOX.

Pine will use the default path for your system (e.g. 
/usr/spool/mail/$USER) unless it is overridden in either
/usr/local/lib/pine.conf or ~/.pinerc.

Some old versions of Pine (e.g. 3.07) incorrectly labeled all attachments
as Application/OCTET-STREAM.  You should still be able to save the
attachment to a file though...

Check the last-time-prune-questioned setting in your .pinerc file.  This 
should read "94.6" after your first Pine session in June....

You can adjust this by setting use-only-domain or user-domain in your 
.pinerc or /usr/local/lib/pine.conf file.

In our DEC environment, most of our VT420 terminals are configured to 
support multiple sessions.  With session #1 being on the VAX, session #2 
on an Ultrix host executing PINE, the user receives an indication that 
something has happened in session #2.

When the user switches to session #2, the FOLDER INDEX screen is still 
blank -- ie, no messages received.

Does PINE refresh the screen even if no new messages have been received?

Much obliged.  Now I can continue having directories beginning with

Shalom!

I work from home via modem from my VT220.  Recently I decided to begin
using pine, rather than my favorite /usr/ucb/mail, so that I would be
better able to support our users.

Well, things are fine at work -- there I run a pure X11R5 environment,
xterms (no SunStools stuff) -- and while composing mail I can press the
Ctrl-Shift-Underscore combination and get my Alternate-Editor (vi, of
course :)

But back at the ranch it's a different story -- here, pressing Ctrl-
Shift-Underscore gets me nada... bupkis... gornisht...

I run with my terminal emulating a "cita", because the vt-emulations
screw-up my listings and other things.  But even if I set term=vt100,
I still cannot access my Alternate-Editor in pine.

Anybody run into this problem?  Anybody gotta solution?

    As a one-time solution for each time you need to do this, you can
move your cursor to the start of the second line which has been wrapped,
and delete the previous character, which will cause the second line to
be appended to the first, with the space that ends the first line before
the newline left intact.  So long as you do not have need to make any
further corrections to this long line, it should remain intact as a
single line.
    Note that anything that causes Pine to make use of QUOTED-PRINTABLE
encoding will result in the line being broken with the MIME continuation
character ( = ) inserted.  This would include making use of any 8-bit
characters.  The reason for breaking this line is to assure it would
pass any gateways which chop lines longer than a certain length.

Hmm... I admit that it's not the greatest algorithm in the world, but it
works rather well for me.  (The only problem I have is with sentences with
the ending punctuation enclosed by parentheses, as this one is.) [It would
be nice if it would preserve my double-spaces after parens, braces, '<>',
etc.] <sigh> Just an op...

Actually that's not quite true - I get 2-3 of these a day from various 
groups.  The problem appears to be that some people are still running 
listserv, others are running domo, and some systems converted from 
listserv to domo [*NOBODY* goes the other way!! :{)]  That leaves people 
confused as to how to get off a list; when they do the old-fashioned 
commands they stop working, so they try anything...

Standards.  Gotta love 'em.

Subject line says it all.  I'm new to PINE (in a previous incarnation, I 
had a direct ethernet connection,and used my Mac as a mailer), and I'm 
finding that a lot of things I want to know about are in this newsgroup, 
including some things I want to know about, but didn't know I wanted to 
know about, if you know what I mean.

Anyway, is there a FAQ for PINE, aside from the man page?

Nice work, BTW.

Could someone please send the specifications for cc:mail attachments
to the authors of pine?  It would be nice if such a feature could
be incorporated, unless there are legal issues involved.  Unfortunately,
our company has gone whole hog into cc:mail, which has NO easy/cheap/free
method of remote access over dial up lines.  I would like to be able
to interoperate with these people relative to binary attachments.
I would hope that Lotus gets the message and adds BASE-64 MIME
capability to its product.  Spread the word about pine and MIME and
let's get MIME to take over as fast as possible!

FYI,
this is also a mail list group! i receive it by e-mail (as well as usenet)
but the people who put unsubscribe are sending it to the wrong address :-(
funny thing is if you cancel your article that you posted in usenet 
everyone on the e-mail list gets an article canceled by so-and-so message
in their e-mail a real waste of bandwith!

I wish they just filter those things out

If a new user who does not yet have a ~/Mail file uses pine with this set in
the global pine.cfg file, pine chokes.  However because of long time use of

If a new user who does not yet have a ~/Mail file uses pine with this set in
the global pine.cfg file, pine chokes.  However because of long time use of
elm here we need to do this for compatibility.  I have wrapped pine in the
following shell script:


#!/bin/sh
# This ensures that pine has ~/Mail/ available as a folder directory, since 
# pine does not check the global rc file before it creates ~/mail/, although
# it can be set to use ~/Mail/ in the global or user rc.

Pine will use a "->" in the index if your tty speed is 2400 or below.  If 
you are dialing in through a terminal server, try "stty 1200" before 
entering Pine.

When Pine does its new mail check (every 2.5 minutes in 3.89), an '*' is
displayed in the upper left corner as a visual queue.  There will be an
option to turn it off in Pine 3.90.

I'm not sure this is the appopriate newgsgroup for this, but since 
everyone seems so helpful...

When I post in tin, my name appears as "Douglas E.F. Helmreich".  Now,
while I'm thankful for my parents' indecisiveness in naming me, and to
bear the extra burden of 2 family names, I would rather the net's first
impression of me to be plain ol' Doug Helmreich.  How can I change this?
I succeeded in editing my name file in .pinerc, but that doesn't seem to
work for tin.  Will a solution require me knowing how the heck IMAP works?

Just curious, what would you suggest?  That they wrap on the screen? Then
it would be even more unreadable.  You can either justify the stuff with
^J or buy a "real" (X)terminal, and just resize your pine window larger
so it all fits.

I know that ^A takes you to the front of the line, and ^E to the end
of the line.  I haven't really had the need to use anything else,
especially since I started using emacs to avoid the ridicule of my
friends.

Reopen the text file in Word. Format the lines at less than 80 
characters (easiest to do if you put it in a monospaced font like Courier.)
Save as text with line-enders.

Justify basically puts paragraphs back together so that if you add
something to your text afterwards, it will 'straighten' your lines
again.  The problem is that it does that to all lines up to the next
blank line.  If you are replying and justify with mail included, there
are no blanks lines (due to the > at the beginning of each line, and
it justifies everything.

Just a short (and easy to code) request.  In the mail index If I hit the 
space bar 4 times, and there are 3 screenfulls of email in the index, so 
at the end of the 4th press of the space bar, shouldn't the highlight bar 
be on the very last message in the index?  Instead it's at the top of the 
last page, and to get to the bottom I have to use the arrow key several 
times.  I think it's intuitive that the final press of the space bar 
should put you at the very end of the index, not just the last screen of 
the index.
Thanks

The volume off mail regarding this question is getting to large for me to 
respond to individually so this post will have to suffice. No, I have gotten 
no response, private or otherwise to the question. If I do get a response 
privately, I will post it for all rather than mail copies to individuals. 
To all who inquired about the answer,  THANKS for the interest, I thought I 
was the only one with a rather specialized problem.

As far as I know, it is impossible to do this from pine alone, you need a
gateway program which understands cc:Mail's import/export format, and
translate between it and MIME. (PMDF from Innosoft is such a beast on VMS
systems). cc:Mail has its proprietary mailbox format and nobody is allowed
to read/write to it directly. When someone figured out its format before,
Lotus promptly changed it. Lotus's cc:Mail SMTP gateway does not support
MIME yet, although they have claimed that they would add MIME support.

	I think it's a security of unix rather than pico, so I would 
suggest you to change mode [chmod] the relevant directories for suitable 
users.  Though it's not very constructive, I do hope it could solve your 
problem.

To invoke the alternate editor on a VT220 terminal use
the ^/ key (Control-/) which sends out an octal 034.
On a VT220, use the ^/ key in place of ^_ key within pine.

This key should work if you are in VT220 mode with 7-bit
control characters.

Comment: MEMO 1994/06/10 16:35

     It would probably be difficult to do, as cc:Mail seems to xmit
     messages in binary (as opposed to net-ASCII).  About the only way to
     get a cc:Mail message into net-ASCII/SMTPable text is through a
     gateway...  I doubt it would be possible to integrate pine & cc:Mail
     easily.  Of course, there is always the possibility that I have
     absolutely no clue what I'm talking about...

	Will the next version of Pine (3.90) support command execution

Thanks. [ Hoping for "This will be added in Pine 3.90". ;) ]

Yes, its possible. We have PC Pine 3.89 running and we are using LAN Manager 
2.2. However, in order to get PC Pine to work we have to use an 
NDIS-to-packet driver like DIS_PKT.GUP, or a direct packet driver like the 
Crynwr 3C509.COM, to supply the packet driver that Pine requires. We haven't 
been able to get Pine to use the TCP/IP that comes with LAN Manager.

We use both NETBEUI and TCP/IP in our environment and have gotten Pine to 
run on PCs that run both NETBEUI and TCP/IP as well as PCs with just TCP/IP. 
Just recently we had a problem printing Pine e-mail on network connected 
printers and determined that we needed NETBEUI installed and could not run 
with just LAN Manager's TCP/IP and whatever packet driver we needed for Pine.

Hope this helps.

As Simon says, "Why?"  Have you not found the mailing list feature?  I 
send out periodic mailings to two lists, each pushing 50 addresses, and 
no one ever sees screenfuls of addrresses.  I put a bogus address in the 
To: field and then put the list name in the Bcc: field.

As Nietzsche once said "RZFM!"  :-)

Howdy

I think I have everything straight on imapd but what do I put in imapdrc?

The tech notes mentioned an imapdrc file but I haven't seen what you
write in it.

Here is what I want to do.  I want to put a mail file in this directory:

	/usr/local/data

But I want everybody in the world to be able to read the letters in this
mailbox.  It is the same as when you get access to

	{pine.cac.washington.edu/anonymous}

and you see those letters.  I want to do the same thing but I don't
know how.  It seems that the correct syntax would be

	{hostname/anonymous}/usr/local/data/mailfile

I have in the place the imapd server and the symbolic link rimapd, but after
that I am not sure what to do.

Paul Kramer -

     The best answer for the imapdrc file (which is now called by a different
name) is ``if you don't know what to put in it, you don't need it.''  Trust me
on this; it should be considered black magic that only sorcerers should delve
into.  [If I had my way, it wouldn't exist at all, but for a few very limited
set of applications it was necessary.]

     Assuming that you have set up the IMAP server correctly so that you can
log into it with your user name and password, the only thing needed to enable
anonymous access is:
	touch /etc/anonymous.newsgroups
At the present time the contents of this file is not checked in any way.

     You can not, however, use
	{hostname/anonymous}/usr/local/data/mailfile
because anonymous access does not permit you to look at any arbitrary file in
the filesystem.  You have to consider the obvious security implications of
	{hostname/anonymous}/etc/passwd
if such were permitted.  But it isn't.  The only files that you can get at
from anonymous are netnews groups, in case you access them with a syntax such
as:
	{hostname/anonymous}*comp.mail.pine
or files which are in the ~ftp directory (that is, accessible to anonymous
FTP).  For example,
	{hostname/anonymous}*fred/blurdybloop
will get the file ~ftp/fred/blurdybloop.

     Certain details of the above functionality will change in the IMAP4
version of the c-client based IMAP server.  However, it will always be the
case that only specifically enabled files will be accessible via anonymous
IMAP access, because of security implications.

Regards,

-- Mark --

Paul,
The ability to provide anonymous access to an arbitrary file is certainly
a reasonable thing to do, provided that access can be constrained to just
the intended files, which is why the present options to do this are so 
limited... However, we will be looking at this issue more closely before 
long, and may be able to come up with additional alternatives.

One caveat on Mark's answer: the reason we have never announced that Pine
and UW's IMAPd can be used to access anonymous ftp archives is that the
user-visible name syntax WILL CHANGE later this year.  Also, there are
presently user-interface inconsistencies resulting from Pine thinking that
these folders are newsgroups when they are not.  So please don't use the
facility unless you are willing and able to later change all the .pinerc
files in your constituency that might embed the present name syntax.  Do
not assume that the present * syntax will be supported retroactively
except for actual newsgroups.

I am looking for a way redirect my mail into seperate folders for
later reading with pine. I know this can be done with elm but I prefer
pine and we dont have it here anyway. Basically all I want to do is
put the mail from a mailing list into a seperate folder so I dont have
it mixed in with my other messages. I don't think I can do this with
pine but a simple stand-alone program would be okay.

I have seen references to a program called 'filter' but I look around
the ftp sites and archie draw a blank.

Thanks in advance.

Wouldn't it be great if...  The ^Justify command could be configured to 
use the internal algorithm or, alternately, to call an external paragraph 
formatter command.  There's this really great Unix program called 'par' 
which works like an improved 'fmt'.  It justifies your text, preserves 
indenting, does The Right Thing with ">quoted" text, etc.

And wouldn't it be great if the dev team brought beer!  :-)

The .pinerc file is nicely self-documented (though often it will take 
just trying it to be sure of the effect of setting one of the suggested 
flags).  Try reading that file ... I suppose you could even do it from 
+within+ pine by opening a dummy message and then using ^R and specifying 
.pinrc as the file to be read in.  To change the flags though you'll need 
to edit the file in a way that doesn't put header info into the result -- 
pico, the editor that pine uses, will do the job if its available as a 
standalone on your system....  %pico .pinerc    The familiar pine ^X is 
the way out.

Is Pine 3.89 able to automatically reply with a prepared message when 
mail is received?

Filter is a good program, but is included with the elm program source, so 
archie-ing for 'filter' won't do any good.  instead, archie for elm, 
download it, compile it, and dump everything but filter.

Several months ago, there was a push for the inclusion of filter in the 
pine source due to the impossibility of using archie to find it, but 
regretably that degraded into a elm vs. procmail vs. deliver flamewar and 
nothing was ever done. :(

Yes.  I don't know how to do it (it involves a .forward file), but I
know it exists cause my Computer Science professor has one set up, and
UMBC still uses 3.89.

If you mean have the sender receive a message when their message is
delivered, this is not related to Pine or any other mail program which
is used by you only to access and handle the mail.  It sounds like
you just want to have a message returned to the sender "while you sleep."

All you have to do is make a .vacation.msg file.  Its contents are sent
to everyone who sends you mail.  For information about this, check
the man by entering this command at your prompt:   
             
                             man vacation

Well, since it is the PIne COmposer, a long 'i' would be reasonable, but 
around here we usually pronounce it peeko...

Pine people,
I saw a news group item stating to write and put in a word of two for 
other than English Alphabet character version of Pine.

I would like to see pine to use "UNICODE" or some other two byte 
character in messages. I do a lot of translations into Vietnamese and a 
romanization of Cantonese (Chinese Dialect). I am a school teacher and 
allow my students to E-Mail letters to worldwide friends. Some of the 
have been very creative to expression other culture ideasusing the 
English Alphabet for their words. It would bee much easier for them to 
use their language.
Consider this another vote for Chinese and Vietnamese character sets in pine!

I get my mail on a Unix machine which I normally access by modem from my 
PC. At the end of each month I download my messages for that month to 
conserve space on my Unix account.  Can anyone suggest a way of reading 
these messages on the PC which would allow me look at them as with Pine 
or an off-line reader?
Thanks

It's not really suitable in this case - because I'm using pico as 
an editor inside a bbs shell, everyone is user "bbs" to the system.

However, I've received mail regarding doing this, and will summarize
once I have all the details...

Message-Id: <raanCrAr6q.MnB@netcom.com>
Date: Sun, 12 Jun 1994 18:25:38 GMT

I have been using Pine for a while now, and I find it great.

Before moving over to Pine, my standard mail agent was Mush with the
-v flag on. This flag (which, I believe, is similar to the -v flag on
ucb mail) would cause the mail agent to announce connection open, close
and failure with the target machine, aliasing and .forward operations
occurring, user not found (instead of getting a bounce) etc. .

This gave me a nice hands-on feeling, which I like. Is there a way to
get the same effect on Pine?  I don't care if it will throw the screen
out of sync, forcing me to ^L.

Thanks

That has not yet been implemented, but some recent restructuring in Pine 
would make it quite easy to do so....

The -v behavior (of ucb mail, don't know about mush) is just what you get 
by passing -v to sendmail.  So, if we always called sendmail to send mail 
it would be easy to add -v.  Unfortunately (as far as -v is concerned) 
there is also the smtp-server=some-server option.  It would be a lot 
harder to do the verbose stuff when that option was defined.  If we did 
it just for the sendmail case, we'd have an inconsistent UI.  So, I don't 
think we'll be doing this any time soon.

I have to send some long messages that involve reading files into Pine.  For
the life of me, I can't find a way to jump to the top or bottom of a 
message, while in compose, except tedious repetitions of ctrl-V and ctrl-Y.

Am I missing something somewhere <I hope!>

Odds are that's exactly what's happened.  This happens to me when I
suspend a pine session and then forget about it and try to open a new
one.  This results in my having to close both session and start again.

	What Tim suggested is in fact to put your forwarding address in a 
file called .forward and your incoming mails will be routed to the new 
email address automatically.  I think this does not involve PINE 3.89 at all.

Current versions of Pine do not have TOF/EOF, but the upcoming Pine 3.90 
will.

Tin get's your fullname from /etc/passwd. You can change your fullname on
most UNIX-Systems with 'chfn'.
Tin does not use IMAP in any way.

A suggested enhencement to Pine from one of our staff...

Subject: PINE enhancement request

Please, would it be possible to submit this as an enhancement request?

UNIX, VMS and other operating systems have 'environment variables' and 
'logical names' which a user may set up to point to various structures 
and subdirectories as a sort of 'shorthand'.  Sometimes these are used by 
systems administrators to avoid users having to know the full path for a 
file specification.

PINE, unfortuneately, does not appear to accept the use of such file 
paths in the <CTRL>R file inclusion facility - a place where it would be 
very useful to be able to grab a file form a specific area (as I do from 
time to time with respect to my documenation arae, $DOC, which is short 
for /usr/peters/doc).

Thanks,

Peter

I'd go very slow on the idea of access to arbitrary files.  You need to be
very careful about the security aspects of this.  It is a little sad to
see the freaping creaturism that seems to be overtaking pine and its
asociated programs like imap.  Those folks who are concerned about
security look upon any added complexity in a program as a potential
security hole.  A MUA that doesn't use privileges can be made relatively
safe. But I'm not so sure about something like imap.  But even with pine
itself I am scared by some of the positive comments I hear about adding
shell escapes and pipes.

	I've received a bunch of suggestions from quite a few people; thanks
for allyour help (i'll try to e-mail you all).  Anyway, for some reason, chfn
does not work in my system.  I tried to edit the etc/passwd file, but it
would not let me save any changes to the file.  I'll keep you posted.

Freaping creatureism! 

There seems to be this insane desire to peek at what is going on under the
hood. While this sort of option is good for debugging problems it is not
the sort of thing that needs to be used routinely.  One could even make
the argument that it reduces productivity of the user as they wait for
smtp to do its thing instead of going on to real work. 

As you point out, you are looking at a MTA function and not a MUA function
and making it work depends on the MUA-MTA interface.  If you need to
include it make it a debug option and put the output in the debug file.

You need to change your finger information by invoking: passwd -f. You will
then be prompted for your new full name. Old full name is the [default].

Good luck,

You can, in the interim, MAIL messages to a newsgroup using Pine, by
using one of the gateways.  For example, given a group called 
'anews.group', here is how you would mail a message to be posted to it:

      Example                        This group
anews.group.usenet@decwrl.dec.com    comp.mail.pine.usenet@decwrl.dec.com

Dan,
We agree with your security concerns, which is why the imapd access 
facilities are so constrained.

We have no plans for requiring Pine or imapd to run as privileged programs.

There have always been some shell holes (e.g. for printing), and it's 
true, a Pipe cmd is coming in 3.90, but we're working on a way to disable
these for sites that wish to.

I thought I saw a message on this thread a while ago, but never saw an 
answer.  

First, is there a version of pine specifically for os/2?  I don't care
about a gui version: ascii is fine. 

Second, I see from this group that there is a version for DOS.  Has 
anyone gotten it to work under os/2 with ibm tcp/ip (1.2.1 or 2.0) and 
its sendmail?  Where can I get the DOS version?

Thanks very much.

Subject: Uploading files to mail

Message-Id: <2ti37l$cp3@tequesta.gate.net>

Any help on this one will be greatly appreciated. 

When I save an ASCII text file with Word 6.0 for Windows, and then upload 
to my host, I notice that the carriage return control sequence (^M) is 
present in my inserted file when I view it in PINE. 

The interesting thing is that some recipients of the mail get gibberish 
on their screens while others get the message intact. 

Could the ^M characters be responsible for corrupting the mail message?

Is there a way to avoid editing my upload before inserting the file into 
PINE?

Thanks in advance.

I've followed this discussion, tried chfn, was told that my login name 
was not in etc/passwd, and likewise was rebuffed when I tried to add it.

When I do chfn, I get the name [Daniel Ford] and no office number or 
office or home telephone numbers. If I try to change any of these fields, 
I get the reference to /etc/passwd, round and around.

When you're at the end of a message, you can use ^W with a <space> as the 
search-string and search will wrap back to the top, usually the first 
line.  Anywhere in the message, you can postpone (^O) and then restart 
composition.  

If I had this problem repeatedly, I would use pico (or some 
other editor) to put "bookmarks" into the long files that I planned to 
read in -- some unlikely combination of characters on a line by 
themselves... ::1, ::2, ::<n> ...or the like -- so I could jump around 
conveniently and then use ^W:: ^K as many times as needed to get rid of 
them if I thought it rude to forward the file marked up in that way.

Pine 3.90 sounds like it will be much better.

If you're not allowed to change the information stored in /etc/passwd
(which we are not) then use an environment variable to set your name.

	setenv NAME "Johnny Briggs"

Will do the trick.  Notice that my post is from "Liam", not "Crilly"
as it is stored in /etc/passwd.

My system op is having troubles gettin 3.89 running under AUX.  What 
happens is this...

When you press <enter> after putting in an address, it asks you for the 
name of the attached file!  It therefore won't take any names from the 
address book. 

The second anomoly is that if you type short (less than the entire page 
width) lines, PICO will try to fill the lines to their entire width by 
putting all the text together!

Weird!

If you can help, please email your ideas to ericr@vita.org and 
rmuffley@vita.org (Richard is the network administrator, I'm just keepig 
him honest before he leaves on a 5 week vacation on Thursday!). 


Thanks,

I believe your system sends control-J when you press the return key.
Note that it is doing what control-J does.  Maybe you can make it stop
doing that, maybe not.  We couldn't.  You can solve the problem by
hacking the code to make control-J do the same as control-M, and then
reassign control-J commands to other keys.  For pico you end up
dropping something (we dropped spellcheck) to make room for justify
(really fill-paragraph, as you describe).

Hi there.....
 
    Sorry if this has been covered before, but i'm a newbie to Pine. In any
event, we have a test version of Pine, and expect it to become our user mail
agent. Whenever I try Pine -k to get function keys, it only recognizes F1-F4.
(I am using an IBM PS/2 50 keyboard.)  Any ideas/help? Thanks.

I assume that you're running this on a UNIX system?  If you are, did you 
run the DOS2UNIX or equivalent command first?  Otherwise, you can have 
errant ^M's in there.  Check and see.

Yes, to avoid the save prompts use Pico in "tool mode," i.e., 
"pico -t".  If you're using csh or tcsh you can set this in
your .login with these two lines:

setenv EDITOR 'pico -t'
setenv VISUAL $EDITOR

I hope this helps,

If you want every message to get the auto reply then vacation is
probably the best thing to use.  If you only want some messages
to get an auto reply then you'll want to use something like
Elm's filter program and its executec command.  Note that you
don't need to be an Elm user to use filter.

Another thing you can do is link the Mail and mail directories.  This
allows you to forget about establishing settings for all the MUAs you
may use.  I regularly use elm, pine, and good ol' Unix mail and my
life has been much easier since I linked these.  If both already exist
here's one way to set it up:

1] cd
2] mv mail mail.old
3] ln -s Mail mail
4] move folders from mail.old directory to Mail (aka mail) directory 
   being careful to not destroy any folders that the same name, e.g.,
   you could use:  mv -i ~/mail.old/* ~/Mail
   

I also have linked my News directory to my Mail directory (ln -s Mail News)
so I can easily use newsreaders and MUAs to organize all my folders.

Enjoy,
Nancy

Hello Pine Developers,

For the next release of Pine it would be great if you made the great
little utility ansiprt as high profile as pico.  Both of these are
great standalone tools but currently most sites don't make ansiprt
available on the default path.

Thanks much,
Nancy

PS - Pine and Pico are the **best** MUA and editor for new users.
I bet that soon you'll see all the zillions of Internet books
recommeding them.  And from what you've said I (a die-hard Elm
user) may switch to Pine 3.90, but I'll stick with vi!

Subject: Folder seperators?

How does Pine tell where each message starts or stops within "folder"
files?  As far as I can see, each message is seperated only by "From " on
a new line.  I'd like to be able to split a folder into the component
messages, but that doesn't seem like a particularly unique key.  There
don't seem to be any imbedded control characters or anything either. 

Thanks for your help.

Your site may already have filter installed - type "which filter" to
see if it shows up anywhere on your path.  If it doesn't you can
find it with the Elm sources (as others have pointed out).  Here's
what I did to have filter filter my mailing list messages:

1] Put the following in my ~/.forward:

"|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

Note you do want to include the quotes and you want to replace
/j/nancym with your home directory path and /usr/local/bin with
the correct path for your system.  Also on some systems you
need to have your home directory world executable and the .forward
world readable for this to work.


2] Put the following in my ~/.elm/filter-rules

if (to contains "filmfest") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.filmfest"
if (to contains "seasigi") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.seasigi"
if (to contains "lynx-dev") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.lynx-dev"
if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-talk"
if (to contains "www-announce") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-announce"


3] To test that the filter rules are syntactically correct type the
   following at your Unix prompt:  filter -r

4] Regularly look at filter-errors to make sure things are working.


See the filter man pages for more info.

I hope this is helpful,
Nancy

Other than uuencoding the file, which can increase the actual size of the 
file by as much as 30% or more, I don't know of any other way to mail a 
binary to a non-mime-compliant recipient. Of course, you could have the 
recipient upgrade the mail system to something mime-compliant...

While there's probably a better technical answer on its way, you can 
always enter the folder and export individual letters as files.

Message-Id: <Pine.3.87.9406132004.A19596-0100000@husc4.harvard.edu>

Does anyone know if it's possible to extract and print an entire folder
from Pine, rather than extracting it one file at a time (this can get
pretty tedious!)?  Ideally, I would like to be able to extract a folder in
order to download it and print it at home, since I always dial up across
my modem, rather than using a terminal on campus (thus I'm not near an
on-campus printer). 

A second-best solution for me would be one that involved going in to the 
computer center on campus in order to pick up my print-outs from the 
printer there.

Thanks in advance for any and all help you might be able to offer!

Doug, I think things will be a little different here at UofM... Your name
is stored in a kerberos database, and isn't really that accessable by the
average user. I guess I would try Liam's suggestion - boy, this feels
weird to me... ;^) - of the environment variable. (I just tried it, and it
worked.) Or, if you wanted to change it for real, everywhere, I think
you'd want to send a message to x500@umich.edu detailing your problem / 
request. They're the people who actually change the database.

hope this helps,
Liam

Most Pine folder formats are stored as plain text files, one per folder.  
Just download the whole file from your ~/mail directory...

For the default Berkely folder format used by most Unix systems, the
separator is indeed the line that begins "From ".  Pine does check to see
that the rest of the line looks reasonable, but not all mail programs do. 
That is why you will sometimes see a "From " at the beginning of a line
converted to ">From "... 

There are alternate formats that Pine understands that do not have that
problem, but other mail tools do not understand them.

How do I get/use Elm's filter and executec command. I have not used Elm, 
although it is available on my unix system. How does "filter" determine 
which messages to reply to???--the subject, mail alias, content???
I would be interested in such a setup for replying to requests for 
certain publications which reside in my account.

I would be interested in a few more details on this setup.

Would one of you kind soles share with me just how do I get a file 
attached?  Let's say I compose a letter but use my regular word processor 
because I will from time to time want to send to different persons.  
Let's say it (the letter) is on a floppy.  How do I get it and attach 
it so it can go in to the big super highway?

What about this code thing?  If I send to say someone on Prodigy or 
America Online will they be able to read?  Is there something I can do so 
they can.  I'll just be sending text, no graphics etc. at this time.  
Need to walk before I can run!

		Thank You  I appreciate your time.

Assuming that you are using Unix, you should do a:

dos2unix dosfile > newfile

before unloading it.  This should eliminate the ^M's.

Daniel,
Don't think so. Try this. 

KORN SHELL (ksh)
Getting rid of ^M's in ascii (text) files in your UNIX directories.
Put this function is in your .kshrc file (or .profile file). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
clean()			#take text (ascii) file from DOS and strip ^M
{				# (carriage return) from end of lines.
tr -d '\r' < $1 > tmp		#use temporary file, then
mv -f tmp $1			#replace original file with stripped file
tput smso			#turn on inverse
echo $1 " has been stripped of ^M's"	#and say so
tput sgr0				#turn off inverse
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the $ prompt type  clean filename .
Or just use  tr -d '\r' < oldfile > cleanedfile , each time.                      

(This function is in /tmp as "clean.fun" on Cybergate)

I have precisely the same need.  

In addition I would like to have some way of automatically *indexing*
articles as they are stored in a *database* which could be efficiently
searched at a later time.  I am finding that I am accumulating hundreds of
articles in dozens of different folders corresponding to different mailing
lists and newsgroups.  Already I am spending much time trying to track
down particular records. I can scan a folder with a viewer such as pg, but
it is a bit awkward, and it does not allow for very sophisticated
searching. Nor does such a viewer incorporate mailer functions so that I
can reply, forward, etc. to a saved article once I find it.

Does anyone know of a product or products which might meet some of these
criteria?

instead of (^J)attaching the file, just (^R)read the file into the 
message.  non-mime mail readers do not compute the attached files(ones 
that you have to (V)view from PINE.

If you have a shell access goto your ~/Mail dir and type "ll" to see what 
files you have in the directory(they should be same as your folders in PINE).
now you can D/L the file/folder or you can view the file by either typing:
more INBOX
or
pico INBOX
(to view your INBOX)
all the folders located in your ~/Mail are VERY readable..

Subject: VMS Pine, sent mail to folder
Date: 14 Jun 1994 15:03:16 GMT
Message-Id: <2tkgrk$rk@tribune.usask.ca>


We are running VMS Pine 3.89, and are trying to use it for our
DCS Help Desk.  We need to keep track of all of our outgoing mail,
so using VMS Mail we had to send a CC to ourselves, then read
the new message and move it to the LOG (folder).  Now that we have
Pine, I tried to set the default-fcc= in the pine.pinerc file to
LOG, as this would save us a lot of time shuffling messages.

Now comes the problem:  The messages that get moved to the LOG
folder this way completely lose their To: and Subject: lines on
the Index display, and as such are completely useless as references.

Am I doing something wrong, or do we have to go back to the CC self
thing again?

Any help would be appreciated.

I use "Lookfor" to read documents that come with shareware. It works

In regards to this last comment-- Yeah, I agree with this one too, it 
always squashes the spaces after parens, which crowds your smileys.  ;-)

As regards to the first comment, try writing a message with paragraphs.
Either separate them with a blank line, like my 2 paragraphs here, or
begin each one with blank space (tab).  The Justify function will clean
them up quite nicely, especially if you have a tendency to go back and
edit your text a lot.

	What is the proper syntax for mail-folder-collection in the
.pinerc?  I seem to have deleted something.. I have tried

	mail-folder-collection	=mail/[]
	 (or whatever it is) 	=mail/[]]
				=mail/
				=mail/[ ]

	It keeps telling me that there is no [ (or ]?) in context: []] And
of course I can't get into my mail folders.  I know it was very similar to
that before.  I am running Unix with PINE 3.89. Thanx in advance.

Is there any way to do this in pine?

Mark or group them in some way, and then dump them as a lot in a
folder?

There doesn't seem to be a FAQ for this group; I did look for one.

Mail or posted replies are both fine. If I get an answer via email,

Go into your .cshrc file and add the following two lines:
	setenv VISUAL pico
	setenv EDITOR pico

This will change your default editor to pico, no matter what
programme you are running.  This is assuming your site is running
some version of UNIX (we have Ultrix V4.4 Rev. 69), but I assume
this will work for most UNIX sites.

For local mail, it is as good as (or perhaps better than) a return receipt.

Unfortunately expanding environment variables this way confilicts with 
the opposing requirement to pass '$' through to VMS based servers which 
rely on the '$' in file names...

My RS/6000 administrator is having trouble copmiling the PINE mail front
end on our AIX 3.2 based 6000. Has anyone done it successfully? Can your
users modify the setup (default save folder, default editor, etc)? If you
could be of help we sure would appreciate some.

Helpful information can be directed to ceyoun@sys1.openohio.com or to me

is there a way to canfigure pine to use mh-style folders? ie. can the
folders be directories with each message a unique file within? i
prefer pine's composition and addressbook features, but don't like
having my mail all glommed together in mbox-type files.

** please reply by email and i will summarize.

To get full MH support you need to either rebuild Pine 3.89 with the latest
IMAP toolkit, or wait for Pine 3.90, which should be available in a few
weeks.

Thank you for that explanation, and to the person who e-mailed me saying 
much the same thing.  It seems odd, but I guess as long as incoming 
e-mail has ">" prepended to other lines starting with "From ", it's 
unique enough.

One more question: which e-mail systems use this format?  Pine, and I 
guess Elm... what about Mail?  Others?  I guess I could just call it the 
unix mail folder format.

How can I add my own header lines to a message I am composing in pine?
Pine seems to list only To:, Cc:, Attchmnt: and Subject: lines.

In particular I want to add following lines:

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/richtext

but some other lines might also be necessary sometimes.

Suggestions?

Sean,

I think what Steve is getting at is - can he use Pine instead of
whatever mechanism TIN uses (I would guess mail) to reply or mail to
people.  So that, for instance, if he has a friend named Peter in his
.addressbook, then if he mails a message to "peter" then TIN will check
the address book and fill in "peter@vm1.uottwa.ca", or whatever.  So
that, for another example, mail sent from TIN will appear in his PINE
sent-mail folder.

My initial answer to this is - NO.

You can use PICO for the editor, but you're still contrained to using
whatever mailing mechanism TIN is using when you send mail from TIN.

Regards,

Paul

Note that many mailers actually expect something more than just a match
on "From " at the beginning of a line. Some are a bit more demanding 
and require an empty line preceeding the "From " and expect a userid
and date in the proper format on the same line. 

I had occasion a couple of times to try to mung some foreign mailbox
formats into Bezerkely format, and I discovered that several mailers
were quite unforgiving about the date format. ( Some were more
accepting, but I forget which was which! ) 

BTW: Who or what entity does the ">From " escaping ? sendmail ?

Cc-ed to header people as these questions are getting no longer pine

Subject: PC-Pine Giving Low on Memory
Date: 15 Jun 1994 15:30:42 GMT
Message-Id: <2tn6r2$fkl@tribune.usask.ca>


We are trying to set up PC-Pine as our default mail reader for DOS
based machines, but are getting Low On Memory, send may not be
able to be completed on replies and forwards if the original
message is included(for now). This seems to depend on the machine,
so I assume it has to do with the amount of base memory available.

How can we get around this?  Is there a way to use EMS or XMS?

Any help is appreciated.

Pine handles the Mime-Version and Content-Type headers automatically. 
Unfortunately Pine does not currently support composing richtext... 

Pine 3.90 will allow the addition of other headers...

I don't see why this would be inconsistent.  You can have a variable called
verbose-send which would potentially be of the format

verbose-send=sendmail,xxx,yyy

where xxx yyy are other types of servers.  For now you may declare that
only "sendmail" is implemented.

I find the -v behavior very informative.  As someone already mentioned,
it functions as a quick "confirm receipt" mechanism; it tells me if the 
connection times out and the message get queued, so that I can later
run "mailq" to see whether my message went out etc. .  

With all respect to consistency, it seems a shame not to include a useful
feature (a very important one, once you get used to depending on it) just
because it cannot be implemented immediately accross the board.  It is a
standard feature in older mail agents, and I, for one, would hate to give
it up.

I humbly request that you reconsider.

Thanks

I have no solution for EOF.  For TOF hit ^_ (alternate editor) and at the

/bin/mail certainly does it.  Sendmail will also do it if the mailer
description in the config file has the 'E' flag set.  However, this 
appears to be intended for delivering mail to files, not mailboxes.
(i.e. when the recipient address is a file name, not a user name)

Subject: pine/mail/LISTSERV discrepancy
Message-Id: <CrGIJo.KtB@inmet.camb.inmet.com>
Date: Wed, 15 Jun 1994 21:04:36 GMT

A pine/MIME/LISTSERV incompatability problem has recently cropped up on an
e-mail list that I receive which I believe has general interest to many
pine users. As background, the list is a discussion group for people with
MS. Several book list references were sent as MIME attachments using pine
3.89. I also use pine 3.89 and could not read the attachments and neither
could anyone else on the list. In fact, pine 3.89 did not recognize that
any attachments existed! Everything was incorporated into the main body of
the message. Another list member (Peter Bendall) investigated this problem
and the results of his investigation are reported below (with his
permission). 

----- Results

Several People commented that Paul Flavell's excellent book list arrived in an
 unreadable format.
Because it _looked_ as if it was correctly formatted in the MESSAGE part, but
 the HEADERS were apparently edited by the LISTSERV, I forwarded a copy to the
 developers of our E-Mail system, (PMDF from Innosoft) who confirmed my
 suspicions -

   _Paul is innocent! LISTSERV named as prime suspect!_
   Almost certainly - Both Paul and his experts at SFSU did the correct thing.
   The message was correctly encoded - only the header lines defining the
   encoding were missing. Probably stripped by the LISTSERV.

(In fact, I typed in the lines MIME-version etc and FORWARDED the mail to
 myself and had no trouble in extracting the WordPerfect!!!)

MIME (Multipurpose- Internet- Messaging- Extensions) is just a way of getting
 round the fact that Unix and BITnet mail only use about HALF the available
 characters of the ASCII code and that things like foreign characters (German
 "a, sz, Danish AA) and Word processors use all 256 in one way or another.
BUT not all mailers know about MIME, nor apparently all LISTSERVs!

*the less technical part of my mail to/from Ned Freed at Innosoft*

[Peter B]
>> I have received the following mail (and others like it) over several weeks.
>>  This particular one is a Word Perfect 5.1 file.
>> It _says_ that it is in mime format, but it is not recognised as mime.Infact,

So Everyone is innocent! Blame the computer!
 HOWEVER, IMHO it may be better to save a copy of your word processor data
 as "text" "text with line breaks" or whatever, if you are going to E-mail it.
 If LISTSERV doesn't chew it up, "their" local Mailer might, and after all that
 the person who gets it might not be able to handle _that_ WP file type on
 _his_ home computer!

Subject: Attaching Binary Files
Date: 15 Jun 1994 21:20:55 -0400
Message-Id: <2to9dn$5pn@zeus.IntNet.net>

I use the Pine mail program and have been trying to mail a binary file to 
a party who uses a mail program that is not MIME compliant.  As I 
understand the process, I first need to use the uuencode program to 
"convert" the binary to an ascii text file.  I've done this correctly, I 
think.  The question that I have regards the actual attachment process.  
Should I attach the uuencoded file using the ^J command while in the 
header or does this re-encode the file in the MIME format?  If there is 
another way to attach the file, how should I go about it?  

I'm new to both the Internet and e-mail and any insight will be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks

Is there a simple way to attach an ascii file in Pine so it becomes part 
of the body of the letter?

Thanks for any help.

	You're right up to attaching the file. Yes, including it as an
attacement in the header will re-encode it in MIME format. You should use
^R when in the body of the message.

Mitch,

On the status line on the bottom of the PINE screen, you should see ^R 
which reads in any file you want. 

Position the cursor below the header into the message area or text body. 
The type ^R. You should then see your inserted text.

Two questions:

How can I insert control characters into pico? On vi I press ^V. Couldnt 
find anything in Help.

Is there a way to edit another file without exiting pico?

You should probably see about getting your party a program to decode
MIME messages.

A minimalist MIME-reading program, munpack, is available via anonymous
FTP to ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  The program
reads MIME messages and writes the decoded parts out to files.
Versions are available for Unix, MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Amiga
platforms.

I asked this question via email a few weeks ago.  The short answer is, 
you can't.  Not directly, anyway.  Of course, don't let that stop you...

Set up a subdirectory, typically at ~/.ctrl/.  In that directory, use vi 
to set up a series of 1-byte files, named a, b, c, etc., consisting of
ctrl-a, ctrl-b, ctrl-c, ctrl-etc.  When you need to insert a control 
character in pico, just use ^R (insert) to read in the appropriate 
control char at the proper cursor position.  Then edit your text around 
the char as needed.

So, to insert a ^V in your document, you would ^R the file .ctrl/v. 
Quite easy once it's set up.

I don't think the answer is well-known to the authors yet, so don't feel
too bad :)

We had been saying "Beta by late Spring", but notwithstanding the fact 
that it is still raining every other day in Seattle, we do seem to be 
running out of Spring...

I'd say "July."

Hi,

I sent this one out a couple of weeks ago, when the mailing-list/newsgroup
issue was at it's hottest.   Maybe this one got lost in the shuffle.  
Here it is again....

I've had a user run into a conflict with the way Pine handles MIME vs
other mailers.  I've included his message for the details (headers and
all). 

We're running Pine 3.88 here.

	Thanks.

Subject: PINE BUG

I have been installing a new version of elm and I have
run into an odd problem with pine.

If I am in pine and I receive a message that has a file attachment,
if I reply to that message and ask for the current message to
be included in my reply, pine also includes the attachment.

(This sounds like a bug by itself)

OK. Now I am in pine's compose function, and I go to the Attachment
line and remove the attachment. I add my comments to the message
and send it.

Pine does not see fit to remove all of the MIME headers in the
message. Although pine seems to be able to ignore all of this baggage
in the header and message body, other mail programs like elm treat the
message as a MIME message . . . which is a pain given that the message
isn't really a MIME message.

Is there anyway of fixing this? Or at least reporting the bug?

The message that results from the above procedure looks something like:

Message-Id: <16JUN199423113809@wccf.mit.edu>


running pine 3.89 under VAX VMS, on a PC connected to the VAX
by ISDN line and running PCLINK 5.4.

when composing a message in pico and typing fast, one gets random
screen garbage looking like [16;38 at the point you're typing
every once in a while (looks to me like the escape code for
positioning the cursor to row 16, col 38.

this only happens on the PC, not on real VT102 or VT220 terminals
(the PC is in VT220 emulation), and also only happens in pico,
not emacs or edt.

understood that this is not the most common setup, but does anyone
have any suggestions?

i've just started getting into pine 3.89 and it's default save
directories, and i'm wondering if it's possible to have the default save
to by-sender for incoming mail and by-recipient for outgoing.  not that
it's really that hard to do the ^r and change the fcc: line, but it'd be
much easier if it'd do it for me...

maybe in 3.90  :)

We have been using Pine 3.89 for about two months on an IBM AIX system.  I 
have been accessing the system with a PC via modem and have used the local
print option.  However, with files that require more than three pages to
print, large sections of the document disappear in the cyber black hole.
any suggestions as to why?

on the PC:
Crosstalk for Windows
Terminal setting: VT102
Comm Setup: 8/1/no parity, RTS/CTS flow control, break length 500
Modem Setup: Hayes V series smartmodem 9600
Comm port buffer size: 2K

I have noticed that by increasing the comm port buffer size, I can get more
pages printed before data disappears.

thanks

	I am having difficulty sending files.  Could someone 
tell me how to:
	1. Import a small ascii file into the message section of the 
letter.  I am using ProComm for DOS as my communication program.
	2. How to write the file into attached file after I kermit it
to the server.
	3. Sometimes when I succeed in getting 2. correct and the file
transmits my receiver tells me he has received "garbage". 
	Thanks
Michael

When we pine goes away to retreive large folder indexs, or other time
consuming operations, there seems to be no indication on the screen
that pine is busy working.  This lead users to continue hitting
keys trying to get it to respond.  Any plans to add a "Working..."
or other on screen indication that Pine is busy working?

Pico is meant to be a very easy-to-use editor, without extravagancies. Ok,
but at least cursor movement commands should be improved. In version 3.89
there is no command for 'word left' (indeed very useful for fast backing
your way into the text) and the 'word right' command ctrl-@ (=ctrl-space??)
does not work on all terminals (not on mine, anyway). So please bind
commands to keys probably working on most terminals.
Glad to learn that ver. 3.90 will be equipped with ToF and BoF commands.

I have been happily using Pine (3.89 on Ultrix) for a long time.
Recently I have noticed the following problem occurring a few times.

I start composing a message, and I enter MANUALLY a longish list of
addressees (say 5-6 or more, all of them are entries in the .addressbook).
(apparently the problem does not occur if the list is a single alias
in the .addressbook, but I'm talking here of occasional ad-hoc lists ...)


Then I move to the compose section and start typing.

After a while I go back to the address section to change something in
the header (I cannot swear that all the times it occurs if I type 
control_R to edit the Fcc: or Bcc: fields, but at least last time it
was so).

At this point my keyboard freezes, and Pine dies silently.

Shalom!

When I reply to the "current" message, PINE prompts me whether or not to
include the current message in my reply.  My question is:

How can I include an additional message from my INBOX (or other folder)
into a reply to the "current" message?

For example, in responding to the message Joe sent me yesterday, I want
to reference one he sent last week, which I filed in folder "Joe" (or,
perhaps I want to include a message I got from Sally, or something from
SunFlash...).

R is fine for reading a document into the Compose Window, but what
about an email message?

Anyone got an answer? an idea?

Do any of the addresses expand to fill the line completely?  There is a 
known bug in Pine 3.89 that causes a crash on very long address lines...

[E]xport the old message to a file, then [^R]ead it into a new letter. 
Format and add quotechars manually.  It's not great, but it gets it 
done.  Pine 3.90, I think, will avoid this workaround...

[sorry if this is a duplicate, I had a glitch in my configuration...]

Lucio,

Do any of the addresses expand to fill the line completely?  There is a 
known bug in Pine 3.89 that causes a crash on very long address lines...

Hello:

---------
I think I lost the e-mail but I think I received a
e-mail in regard to PINE 3.9 being ready? Am I
mistaken?



---------
xpbiff and programs alike are useless with PINE (or any
IMAP based programs)....

Is there any body out there uses xpbiff program that
checks  your mail on a remote host and not the local
spool ?


thanks,
Farid

	How about an improvement on the ctrl-^ for marking text... That

I have encountered the same problem with having multiple sessions on a Mac via 
Versaterm Pro.  Pine does in fact write to the screen every once in awhile, at 
least the latest release does.  Each time it checks for new mail, an asterisk 
in the top left-hand-side of the screen will appear.  This is enough for VTerm 
to alert me, and I make that screen active only to realize that there's 
nothing there.

I have gotten around it by using an older version of Pine in another window, 
and keeping the one with 3.89 in the active window, but would dearly LOVE to 
be able to disable this feature.

Is there a way to convert Pine mail folders into mh folders?
They are pretty different, one being an appended file, the other
a directory with numbered messages.  I am in the process of changing 
over and don't know how to reconcile this.

hello pine users!

I am currently using pine 3.89 on a RS6000, it is working fine but....
i can use it with no problems at all from the unix prompt,
I have also set up in a menu to call pine from within another
running program, ie. I am using this program called Impact, on the impact menu
I am able to select P)pine and it works great, but
another user has the same configuration as I do, both in
impact and for pine, he is able to start pine from the unix prompt
but when he selects P)pine from within impact, he gets:

The mail subdirectory already exists, but is not writable by pine
so pine cannot run. Please correct the permissions and restart pine

but like I stated, he can run pine from the unix prompt

any ideas?
thanks, bruce

Message-Id: <1994Jun17.201119.6623@pmafire.inel.gov>
Date: Fri, 17 Jun 94 20:11:19 GMT

Does anyone know of a way to make folder resemble a bulletin
board, where users can read and post and it be shared with
all other email users on the system?

I think I could do it with a local newgroup and NNTP access,
but I guess I'll need rev 3.90 before posting becomes
available. Any Ideas?

Thanks.

Pine 3.90 will include an MH driver.  The latest UW IMAP distribution
(mail/imap.tar.Z on ftp.cac.washington.edu) also includes the new driver
and can be patched into Pine 3.89 quite easily...

Date: 17 Jun 1994 13:24:27 -0700
Message-Id: <2tt0pr$kat@almaak.usc.edu>

After a year of no problems with emacs I'm playing with the pico
editor in pine.  When I try to set a mark (cntrl-^) the cursor moves
to the last line of the document rather than sets a mark.  When I just
type shift-6 I get the ^ mark, but somehow pico doesn't think that my
cntrl-shift-6 = set mark.  Is there something wrong with my keyboard
(an old Mac SE keyboard) or the terminal emulation (I'm using Kermit),
or am I just doing something REALLY stupid?

I actually got screwed by Pine on this front.  I needed to send a raw
ASCII file to someone who didn't have MIME.  The file I needed to send
had some longish lines, so the entire file got put in quoted printable
form and my lines were broken down to 72(?) characters.

Needless to say, the file wasn't useful at the other end.

I ended up sending the files from EMACS since I couldn't figure out
how to outsmart Pine.

I concure have gone through uuencoding 128k files when there is a loadon 
and pine being unsuported here, knowing did the thing crash or is it still 
working would be nice. IMHO

Hello all,
	In a previous post I asked a question about VMS Pine, and
have since received a lot of mail asking 
	WHERE DO I GET IT!!!!!!!

	I must apologise to all, VMS Pine is a proprietary product
available through PMDF.  It is not, unfortunately, a public domain
product.  As for the questions I received about addressing using
VMS Pine, the main answer is yes, you use Internet-format addresses
without having to put SMTP::"<address>", or whatever syntax you are
used to on a VAX.

	Hopefully someone can produce a public version, but until
then, PMDF VAX users are the only lucky ones.

Thanks,
Sean

Plus (as they say) ctrl-@ is a terrible reach for a touch typist!

Any chance we could move toward WordStar commands for the new Pine? 
Remember the cute little diamond of WordStar control keys? It still works 
great.

	Have you tried a simpler way (I think) that you save your file in 
Word 6.0 as "generic text" (Does this form exist in Word 6.0) and not 
simply "ascii text".  Generic text leave long sentences in one line and

	For VMS? 

	There's a beta version of a port available from
	vms.huji.ac.il  in the [.local] directory.

	(don't know any details - just where it is)

Answering my own question. I think I might E xport the letters to 
different files and R ead them into a new composed message and K ill away 
the headers aso junk. But it sounds messy.

Good idea that it will be included in the next version.

I'm not too sure about that. VMS Pine (beta version) by Yehavi is available
via Anonymous FTP: VMS.HUJI.AC.IL:[LOCAL]pine_beta_9.zip (or .bck). Because
it's a beta version you will encounter several bugs when running VMS-Pine, but
nevertheless it is a real good port...

You will need to compile and link the sources with NETLIB yourself. If you
need any help with this mail me: I've got it working (Compiling & linking
will result in lots of warnings but you can ignore them). 

Best wishes,
Rutger

There are two different VMS ports.  One was done by Innosoft, and is 
distributed as part of their PMDF package.  The other one by Yehavi...
His *may* require TGV/Multinet libraries, but I'm not certain of that.

If you export them to the *same* file, you're given the option of
appending each msg after the first one. Then you can do one ^r to bring
all of them in at once.

Date: 18 Jun 1994 17:21:30 GMT
Message-Id: <2tvaeq$6j6@alpha.epas.utoronto.ca>

I've been customizing my .pinerc to change where sent and saved mail 
goes, in order to shorten the default names.  I changed the default 
"sent-mail" to "sent" and the default "saved-messages" to "saved".  The 
only thing I haven't managed to change is the prompt when I go to save a 
message:  it still defaults to "saved-messages" even though I no longer 
have a folder of that name.  How do I change the prompt to default to the 
name I gave the folder, i.e., "saved"?

I'm using version 3.89.

Thanks!

Hi,

I am trying to get Pine to work on a RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.5 and AIXWindows
for Japanese. I can not get it to take the Kanji characters in double byte.
Is there a port of Pine to Japanese?

Thanks for any help.

What I do is turn the mail into a Unix file, then read it in.  Use the 
"export" function on the message(s) you want to quote, then use "read 
file" to read it in.  I believe you lose the quote indicators though.

This is the second time today I've told someone about this method - if 
there's an easier way I'd love to know it too!

"This summer".  There may even be an "early" version included in the 
upcoming 3.90 Beta distribution.

And if you're using something like Zmodem for uploading you can
just type:

     rz -a

instead of:

     rz

before you send your file, and that should strip off the ^M's quite
handily.

Works for me, anyway.

One of the users on our system has pointed out to me a bug in the way 
Pine formats forwarded messages.  Apparently if you have two spaces after 
a period ending a sentence in the forwarded message they spaces will get 
deleted.  Here is the original message and what happens after forwarding.

Josh Hosseinoff      ----       hosseino@yu1.yu.edu

This is my test message which contains some sentences.  After each period 
there are two spaces in it.  You will notice that after forwarding the 
two spaces after each period get deleted.  Odd, wouldn't you say?

(stuff deleted)

We were taught in typing class to leave 2 spaces after the period. Now 
that more and more books are set from the author's computer disks, 
editors are trying to get us to stop this ancient and rather silly 
practice. A sentence is just as legible with one space as two. In fact, 
now that I have switched to this practice, the old system looks strange.

Maybe Pine was written by a former book editor who had to go through a 
thousand page manuscript removing the extra space at the end of every 
sentence :-)

Can anyone point me in the direction of a front-end filter which I can 
use with Pine which will allow me to route new mail to a folder based on 
the sender's address?  I would also, of course, need it to notify me when 
new mail is received regardless of which folder it has been routed to.

Thanks!

If your host is a unix system, you will need to make (minor?) changes in 
the format of your file to avoid these problems.  Some 'loading protocols 
will do it for you.... the -a option on zmodem is supposed to do the 
trick of letting unix know the incoming file is dos/ascii and telling it 
to sort things out.  There's also a program on my system that will do 
this for you once the file is in the unix environment:  dos2unix 
<oldfile> <newfile> .... and its reverse unix2dos for when you need to 
send something back.  Even when I do all of this just as I've been 
taught, though, pine often complains about the last line of my file 
(after ^R) and when I look there's a "^Z" (no quotes) there.  Dunno why.

I have it on good authority that the Holy Grail *won't* be in 3.90.

You'll have to wait until 3.91 for that.  :-)

Except this bug in Pine converts 2 spaces after a period to none, and 
leaves one space after a period the same.  And it only does it when 
forwarding mail.  Personally, I'm a bit of a tradionalist and it will be 
a long time coming before I switch to 1 space.  :)

	Pine 3.90 will be the UberMailer. All others will wither and die

Yeah, I get a whole over-length line of Zs after a Kermit upload. I 
associate it with the beep-beep that ends the Kermit session. (Doesn't 
happen the other way, though.) 

I always pico the file after it gets on the host computer. I've never had 
trouble with the ctrl-Ms that others have mentioned. Maybe because I'm 
doing a binary upload?

(Kermit does binary whether I want it or not. It doesn't cause any 
problem going or coming.)

With this infinite set of features to implement Pine 3.90 will
probably never be ready. How about saving some features for 3.91 and
releasing 3.90 sooner?

Subject: Marking files as answered
Date: 20 Jun 1994 14:05:30 GMT
Message-Id: <2u47na$cfd@lastactionhero.rs.itd.umich.edu>

Is there a way to mark a letter answered without actually answering
it?  I ask this because when I reply to a letter and then postpone
it and then continue it, Pine 3.89 fails to mark the original letter
answered.  I rely on the A tag to tell me who I need to reply to.
I have gotten around this by replying to the message and then
changing the address to my own and sending a dummy letter to myself
(which does add the A tag to the original letter), but this seems
like a lot of work.

This would also be useful if you have several letters from one
person and answer all of them in one reply letter.

Thanks,

Dave

Make a folder in pine and then use the command:

chmod 777 ~/mail/<folder>

now anyone can use the folder with the command:

pine -f ~<you>/mail/<folder>

Note: <you> is your login name, and <folder> is whatever folder you create.

Note2: Some systems may require the directory to be 777 as well.  If this 
is the case I suggest you put it in /usr/tmp or some such directory.

Dare I say it?  These features will be available in Pine 3.90.

--DLM

P.S.  When I say a feature _will_ be in Pine 3.90, that means we already
have working code, or at least experimental code.  If I say a feature
_may_ be in 3.90, it hasn't been written yet...

Date: 20 Jun 1994 11:31:11 -0500
Message-Id: <2u4g8f$j1m@navajo.pd.tgi.plexus.com>

I was wondering if there was an easy way (or if it will be in a future
release) to save mail to folders in subdirectories.  Actually saving
isn't the problem, it is when you use the ^T (to Fldrs) option that Pine
(v3.89) has a problem.  When browsing files to read in, it prompts
something to the affect "This is a subdirectory, change into it?"  When
saving files using the browser it doesn't do that.  I can save messages
if I put the pathname in myself, but often I forget directory or
filenames and have to open another window (if in a windowed environment)
or save it somewhere else and revisit it later.  It just seemed
inconsistent.

After uploading, from the directory where your file was uploaded to, type 
at the prompt:  dos2unix <filename> 
then read into your letter/article as usual.

You'll find that the control characters disappear (and the file becomes 
slightly smaller)

We have recently installed pine3.89 on our Sequent computer running under 
the ptx version 2.10 operating system.  We did our compile using the 
build ptx option.  Things work fine for vt100 terminal users but things 
are not fine for our wyse 60 users.  We think pine is not properly accessing 
our system terminfo files.  Did we miss turning on a flag at compile 
time?   Or this there another way to get pine to use our terminfo file?

Thank you.

I promised to post this question to get myself out of a corner....so 
here goes.

A user in my building is using Procomm for Windows or some such thing to
dial into our system from home.  I think that he likes to compose a
message in WordPerfect (windows or DOS, I just don't know, doesn't
matter).  Then he copies the text into the Windows clipboard, switches to
Procomm.  When he does the paste into the compose screen in Pine, he says
it is extremely slow.  He used to do this when we used UCB mail, and the
response was instantaneous.  I vaguely understand why this occurs, but I
have difficulty explaining it to a novice. 

If you have any clues, feel free to let me know.  If someone has an
answer, good/bad/flame/other, please e-mail to me. 

Thanks.

Pine does not yet support heirarchical folder collections.  In the mean 
time, you can define a folder-collection for each sub-directory, then ^T 
through the appropriate collection.  Heirarchical folder collections will 
probably be available in Pine 4.0.

The first column in the addressbook is the nickname field.  It is not
intended to have full addresses.  The email address should go in the third
column.  The middle and right hand columns will accept and retain values
much longer than will fit the display, so you should not have length
problems there.

Whenever I reply to a message, pine puts my .sig at the top of the
message.  I would prefer to have it put at the bottom.  Is this
possible?

Wyse uses ^K etc as valid cursor control keys.  PINE is HARDCODED as to 
what moves the cursor etc. :(  It would be really nice if 
terminfo/termcap capability were added.

  Yes, some of them are long, although none of them overflows one line.
  I have seen in the past single addresses overflowing one line handled
  successfully.
  Also I am puzzled by the fact that the behaviour is not reproducible
  (sometimes it crashes, sometimes not) on the same address list.

  The following are the addresses giving the problems last time :

 Hello,

 I am surprised. Few weeks ago I asked a question about any attempts
to put PGP public-key criptosystem into pine. And I got no respond at
all. Those that mean: Nobody is interested in having this available
on hand in automatic way in pine ? Is it true ?!

 I assume everybody knows what is PGP and public-key way of cripting
or signing a mail. I have PGP 2.6ui version (UI stands for Unofficial
International release). And as far as I know it can be used with out
restrictions (am I right ? :-), so ...

 Cheers,
 Wojtek

I trust that this then adds read/write support for MH folders in imapd ?
The version we have running here lets you read MH folders, but not

It looks like you do have one address there that will probably overflow
the line.  The problem only occurs if you move the cursor back into the
header and out again after the long address is in the list.  If you just
add the address and never go back into that header, you should be OK. 
This problem will be fixed in the upcoming Pine 3.90 release.

     The reason why nobody gave an answer is because it's been beaten to
     death on this mailing list/newsgroup.  The general consensus was (from
     the Pine Development Team) that including PGP was sort of a gray area
     legally, and that they were waiting for it to clear up before
     including anything.

     Either that or it's in Pine 3.90, right next to the kitchen sink. =)

    This is all well and good, however, note the headers which are

    This is a known bug with Pine's MIME logic -- you have not specified
a particular character set in either your personal .pinerc configuration
file, or the system-wide /usr/local/lib/pine.conf file.  Pine defaults
to US-ASCII if not told otherwise, whether or not you have managed to
include 8-bit data.
    Probably every installation outside the USA should configure the
character set to something appropriate.  Even installations within the
US wouldn't hurt to do the same.  I spent a couple days recently
consulting with people who wanted to be able to send mail in languages
other than English.  They were able to correctly view the Spanish and
French and German texts I had sent them on their X terminals, although
they were cautioned that their display, supposedly US-ASCII, might not
display the ISO8859-1 text correctly.
    As a side note, it appears that if you have US-ASCII set and a
communications path on Unix as cs7, Pine will prevent you from typing
8-bit characters, but you can get them with an alternate editor.  As
soon as you either give the equivalent of an "stty pass8" command to
make your input 8-bit-clean, OR define Pine's character set as anything
other than US-ASCII but still with cs7, Pine will then accept your 8-bit
characters.  So it appears that Pine is trying to keep you from typing
non-ASCII characters unless you define your character set, but it seems
to fail when:  You have 8-bit tty setting, you use alternate editor, or
(perhaps) you reply to 8-bit message.


>T=E4m=E4 on testiviesti, joka on kirjoitettu Pine:lla rst2:ssa.

    Without a character set encoding, I wouldn't know if hexadecimal
character E4 is supposed to represent lowercase a with diaeresis,
Cyrillic small letter ef, Arabic letter lam, Greek delta, a different
Cyrillic KOI8-R character, a Japanese character, a Korean character,
and so on, or a different character to match a PC or Macintosh code
page.  Eudora doesn't either, and I guess it assumes Mac.


>showing the scandinavian characters in a wrong charset.  If I conseqently

    This is because your Pine configuration does not give Pine enough
information that it can tag the message with the proper character set
encoding.  As soon as your system-wide configuration file is set for the
ISO8859-1 character set, I would imagine you will have no problems.

    You could say that if Pine has to use QUOTED-PRINTABLE encoding,
it should know not to tag the message with US-ASCII, and maybe it would
work to default to ISO8859-1, but then, that would be wrong for Asian
or eastern European or Russian users, whose default character set would
be decidedly not the same as yours.  I don't know what the best solution
to help Pine work around configuration problems such as this would be...

There is a very good program called procmail that can handle this.  It
is done through your .forward.  If you can't get procmail, you may look
into filter.  Use archie or something to find it or ask a LOCAL guru.

Hi everyone,

I'd really appreciate it.  
	I'm also having problems getting imapd to run on my mail server.
When ever I send a HUP to inetd, I get the following error in my messages

	I'm running SunOS 4.1.3_U1 on a Sparc2.  There are no typos and the

could you please let me know?  I'll post the results to this newsgroup if 
there are interested parties.

thanks a lot,

Hi,
	I think you are doing the correct steps in 1 and 2.  The problem 
might be that the person you sent the file to was not using pine.  Or 
even if they are, attach file ususally can't be read directly so it ask 
the person to save the attachment in a file.
	One possible way around it, if you are only attaching text file, 
you could read that file into your message by using ^R option.
	I'm not sure if I address you question corretly, but good luck.

I think you can change that in your .pinerc file,
just change the signature-at bottom=yes.  I think there is another way of 
doing it.  I remember there was a post with this same question, so you 
can try looking for it.  				John

we're using mpack and munpack and noticed the following
differences between mpack and pine:

A Pine mail message with a binary attachment looks like
this (encoded 60 characters wide):


  --587206820-278448520-772220586:#1919
  Content-Type: APPLICATION/octet-stream; name=csh
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: BASE64

  f0VMRgECAQAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAIAAAABAAF2XAAAADQAAl+0AAAAAAA0ACAA
  BQAoABQAEgAAAAYAAAA0AAEANAAAAAAAAACgAAAAoAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAwAA



But, mpack creates encoded files with strings of 72 characters long
like this:


  Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="csh"
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
  Content-Disposition: inline; filename="csh"
  Content-MD5: cnjOTuKi9tc/O+6QXUomzQ==

  f0VMRgECAQAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAIAAAABAAF2XAAAADQAAl+0AAAAAAA0ACAABQAoABQAEgAA
  AAYAAAA0AAEANAAAAAAAAACgAAAAoAAAAAUAAAAAAAAAAwAAANQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEAAAAA


Needless to say, when a Pine mail message is decoded with munpack, I get
garbage.  Why the differences?

I gave a workaround a while back.  The original post was to alt.security.pgp
so you may have missed it.  This is a kluge of sorts to allow you to
pgp encrypt messages, although it does not decrypt messages you receive.

>the FAQ on pine interfaces.

I'm posting since this may be of general interest.  If desired,
this may be added to the FAQ with attribution.

here's what I do:

In my .pinerc, I set the editor to a shell script called mkpgp

----- changes to .pinerc -----
# feature-list= comma-separated list of features from the following set:
# Note: the value "old-growth" is shorthand for the indicated features...
# enable-alternate-editor-cmd   (included in old-growth set)
feature-list=old-growth

# editor specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer.
# This is normally an alternative to Pine's internal composer (Pico)
editor=mkpgp
-----

The old-growth enables the alternate editor.  Otherwise you'd need
feature-list=enable-alternate-editor-cmd

Okay, now that you changed your .pinerc, you need the script mkpgp.

----- mkpgp -----
#!/bin/sh
# schake@cs.sandia.gov, May 28 1994
clear
echo ''
echo 'Enter username to encrypt, or return to sign only'
read action
case $action in
    ?*)
	pgp -sew "$1" "$action";;
    *)
	pgp -satw +clearsig=on "$1";;
esac
mv "$1.asc" "$1"
-----

put the file mkpgp in your path, and make it executable (with
    % chmod 755 mkpgp
or something like that.

Now, when you type ^_, pine will run mkpgp.  If you just type return,
it will only sign your message.  If you want to armor the message, type
the search phrase for your public ring and press return.  mkpgp will
then run pgp on your message with the appropriate flags.  IT WILL NOT
CHANGE ATTACHMENTS.  You should armor or sign those files individually
before attaching them.

If you don't want to use pico and already use a different editor for
pine, you'll need to deal with pgp in that editor instead.

Hey...my mailbox is readonly (sorry if you've seen this elsewhere, i am

anyway, whenever i log on it says something to the effect of it gave up 
after ten tries to open the mail box or get it. It is stuck in a process 
which no matter what i try and type (eg kill 5680, kill -9 5680, kill 
-KILL 5680) etc. etc. nothing happens. when i list the processes there is 
a ? where normally i think the terminal should be (ie tty1 or whatever it 
is) also the number which is (i think) where the process started normally 
it would be say 5630 or something, it is 1 !!
Can people please mail me at cocoa@musenet.bbn.com (this mailbox is ok at 
the moment) with some suggestion as to what i might do??
Thanks!

Hello,

I work at DCCS, University of Pennsylvania.

I have a question regarding Pico. When using pico to edit lines greater than 80
characters, it forces in a formfeed. Is there any way to turn it off ? 

That would allow the user to have very long lines. Particularly when the user 
wants to edit the aliases file to make a long list of aliases.

Pine is well blessed with status messages "Sending mail...", "New mail
from..." etc. One place they seem to be missing is when calling up an
alternative editor. We run some slowish systems here, it can take 20 secs
for (say) emacs to kick in after pressing Ctrl _ . In the mean time users
think the command's been ignored and do the sorts of things that
frustrated users do [I don't need to spell these out do I?]. A simple 
"Invoking alternative editor ..."  message would be reassuring.

Message-Id: <sti-210694120246@tko-labra-32.cs.hut.fi>

Has anyone else noticed that there seems to be an incompatibility between
Eudora and Pine.

I am using Eudora 2.0.2 on PB100 (7.1) and Pine 3.89 on Linux (1.1.20). 
The problem is this.

I write a message in Pine.  I use X and am operating in xterm where I can
use ISO-LATIN-1 charset.  I use scandinavian characters "" (I wrote
those in Newswatcher, so these are with the Mac charset) in my message. 
When the mail message is received in my mailspool and I look at it with cat
it looks like this:

However when I look at it in Eudora, it looks like this:

So you see?  Eudora has decodec the quoted-printable encoding, but it is
showing the scandinavian characters in a wrong charset.  If I conseqently
choose from the Eudora charset menu "ISO Latin1->Mac", I get the characters
as they should be.

Why is this?  I do I have to worry about the charset conversions?  And why
do I have to choose "ISO Latin1->Mac", even if I have chosen it to be the
default conversion?

I'm not really looking anyone to blame, but rather looking for an answer
and help. I always thought that MIME was the way to go in the future of
email.  Now I have two email programs that say they are MIME-compatible and
they don't speak to each other correctly.

Thank you!

This newsgroup just popped up on my newsserver today.  Excellent timing.
I just got a message from someone and it appears that it is created with
PINE.  The result is that I can read the first paragraph, but everything
else is a large block of ASCII.  

What is PINE?  I gather it is related to e-mail, but is it an automatic
uuencoder or what?  What I really need to know is if there is any way I
can decode the rest of the message.  Otherwise, I will have to try to
get the author to send me a plain text file.  That's all it is supposed
to be, anyway.

E-mail, non-PINE, to bblohm@hpbs1686.boi.hp.com, or post here, please.

The problem is that with all hte political and legal problems with PGP, I 
can imagine the Lords of Pine{tm} simply don't want to deal with it.  
ITAR is something evil to cross.

You are wrong.  ui cannot be used within the U.S. without violating RSA's 
patents, and if you export it, you can go to jail.

The width doesn't matter, as long as it is less than 76 characters. 
Either pine or mpack should be able to decode an attachment created by the
other, regardless of the difference in line length.... 

If you cannot find some other external cause, send a sample to
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu and we will take a look at it.

Actually, not "needless to say".  The line length does not matter, as
long as lines are no more than 76 characters each.  Munpack 1.4 should
be able to decode messages generated by Pine just fine.

Yes there is:  pico -w

The '-w' option turns off the automatic line wrap.  In fact, I have an 
alias set up:  alias pico 'pico -w'...

Pine 3.90 will include an SCO port.  It should be available in a few weeks.

Yes, the version of the MH driver in the current imap-3.3 toolkit includes
full read-write support in imapd.

I was wondering if there was any way to get Pine to work with SLIP 
through Winsock in windows, I don't need the windows interface, I can run 
it in a DOS box, but I wanted to know if there was a version that would 
work with the Windows Sockets interface.

Hello all,

when invoking pine on HP-UX hpap1 A.09.01 A 9000/710 or
HP-UX hptest A.09.01 A 9000/715
I get the error message "Unparsable date" if I try to access INBOX.
However, when the message is saved into a folder I can invoke that
folder without the error message.

So I diff'ed /usr/mail/zrnsm01 and ~/mail/received and got the
following:

< From zrnsm01@hpap1.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de Wed Jun 22 14:10 MES 1994
---
> From zrnsm01@hpap1.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de Wed Jun 22 14:29:25 1994

The string "MES" is responsible for the error message.
If I substitute "MES" with "MET" 
(as I found on HP-UX hpnic A.09.04 E 9000/816)
I have no problems.
Question: Is there a need to reconfigure the date format 
          or can pine learn that "MES"?

Thanks in advance

I am cross-posting this to the pine list because of the apparent 
relationship to the pine viewer.

Pine version is: 3.87
Trumpet Winsock version is: 1.0 Rev B beta #6

The Trumpet Winsock console reports:

CRITICAL ERROR: TCP poll reentrancy detected - please report exact 
circumstance
socket 1 killed
socket 2 killed
Task WNQVTWSK(3647) did not call WSACleanup

The exact circumstances were (and it is repeatable - but only in a 
local LAN environment):

Environment:  Either a PC with DOS 5, and what follows or a NEC ultralite 
Versa with DOS 6.2 and what follows:

1.  Trumpet Winsock Version 1.0 Rev B beta #6  (also happened on earlier 
versions)
2.  Windows 3.1
3.  WinQVT Winsock, Telnet, version 3.97
4.  Sun OS on the local LAN and pine version XXX

Telnet to a Sun OS host, run pine (email), view a message, press and hold
up or down arrow.  Session crashes with:

"Runtime error 202 @ 0002:39A9"  on the PC

"Runtime error 202 @ 0002:3DA9"  on the NEC


No other information available on the pop up Error window... 

When I go into the text editor "pico" either directly or when I do a
"compose" in pine, I cannot crash the session.  I can only repeat this
when I am viewing a message with the pine application. 

When I try the pine viewer on a distant machine, I cannot cause the error.

I did it again with the TCP Trace on and the error pop up changed from 
39A9 to 3C68.  The trace follows:

I am interested in finding a shareware program which will translate a 
an ASCII text file to Postscript format on a unix platform.  This would
enable me to send formatted files to the email-to-fax network by 
attaching the formatted files via MIME.  Where can I find such a program?

There are MANY of them out there; I use "text2ps" which is available at a

	Often I find it useful to mail files to people using the unix 
redirection tools (ie, < and |).  

	Will 3.89 support this?  Often when I'm reading news I like to
pipe interesting articles to my friends through mail.  Just using regular
old unix mail works, but then I can't use my .addressbook entries.  I
caught the last part of a thread where this was being discussed, so if
this has been answered before, I'd be interested in hearing what the
thinking was on this.
	Does anyone else out there use the piping concept, or is it 
fading away as mailers become more sophisticated.  Is there another way 
to accomplish the same thing?

	thanks.
	Justin

Date: 23 Jun 1994 16:19:49 -0400
Message-Id: <2ucqp5$q86@chopin.udel.edu>


Two problems I am having with pine:

Is there an option in my .pinerc where I can set rich headers to be the default.
So when I reply to or compose a message, rich headers will be on, and pressing
^R will remove them.

Is it possible to set the default sorting to be date and reversed?  If I set
sort-key to date, then from the folder index do $,R  I have the messages sorted
the way I would like them (most recent at the top).  But the best I can do 
now is either set sort-key=date, then do $,R from the index, or set
sort-key=reverse, then do $,D from the index.  Am I missing something,
I tried sort-key = reverse,date but this doesn't work.


Thanks,
David E. Stabosz

Support for PGP can be easily added with an apporiate alternate editor
script as mentioned at earlier posts. I see no reason to ask "Lords of
Pine{tm}" to deal with the matter. However, if they want to add
support for PGP there will be no problems as long as PGP itself or
other crypting algorithms are not included. And I see no reason to
include them.

Original poster was Polish, so U.S. patents are no good there. Here at
Finland algorithmic patents aren't even allowed. Many people think
they shouldn't be allowed anywhere else, too (because they stop
innovation and even the basic algoritms can be easily patented, I have
heard that even the XOR operator has been patented, don't know if the
patent still holds). Software can easily be protected by copyright, no
patents are necessary.

Those poor U.S. citizens can use MIT version instead of UI.

To export UI version from U.S. one would have to import it first. I
see reason why a non-U.S. citizen would do that. So you are completely
off-topic when trying to frighten people with jail.

As a sidecomment, these problems with ITAR concern all programs dealing
with non-bogus encrypting, not only PGP. Even PkZip has had its dose
of problems.

Sorry if this was a bit flamy. Not intentional.

Hi, I have 2 inbox folders in my Pine folder list.  One is INBOX and one

it bugs me.  I tried to delete 1 or the other of them but it did not

Can anyone tell me how to compose an ascii text file off-line and upload it via Pine?  I've been answering while connected, but that is obviously not very satisfactory.

Thank you

Subject: 2 queries about directing saved mail
Message-Id: <1994Jun22.143616.6475@Princeton.EDU>
Date: Wed, 22 Jun 1994 14:36:16 GMT

   Two quick questions about saving mail msgs in Pine (3.89); I *think*
based on my reading of the man pages/.rc that these actions are impossible
in the current version but was curious about workarounds/future versions/etc.

  (1)  I would like to have the default save folder be determined by
the *alias* of the sender, if possible.  I know about "saved-msg-name-rule=
by-sender", and I'm using it at the moment, but would prefer (e.g.) if
I get a message from "bloggs@crock.edu", who is listed in my addressbook
as "joe", to save to folder "joe" rather than folder "bloggs" (default
behavior).

  (2) Is it possible to save *outgoing* messages in different boxes depending
on recipient?  (I know one can configure default-fcc ... one could also Cc: all
mail to oneself, and then decide where to put it when it came back.)

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

One way:  use vi to create a file containing only a ^L.  When you need a 
^L inserted in pine (or pico), ^Read that file into your document.  Edit 
it into place.

   Why not open one folder and sve them all into the other?  Should solve

The problem is a stack overflow in the internals of the winsock.  QVTNET is 
the culprit.  The rest of the messages are the attempt at recovery by the 
winsock.  We will be improving matters by redesigning our tracing code to 
not use as much stack.  Of course enabling the traces can result in stack 
overflows which wouldn't occur under normal circumstances.

In Pico, when you ^Justify you get a cheerful little message saying you
"Can now UnJustify!" and the ^U legend temporarily changes from "UnCut
Text" to "UnJustify".  In Pine Compose, using ^J changes ^U from "UnCut
Text" to "Unfill" temporarily, and no message is issued.  The message is
helpful to novices who have 'beginner_level=ON', especially since the
unjustify option goes away if you do anything else.  More importantly,
shouldn't the legend indicate "UnJustify" instead of "UnFill"?

I'm not familiar with the packaging of Pine, but when you say a feature 
will be in Pine 3.90, does that mean we'll be getting a new version of 
Pico as well?  It would be wonderful if Pine Compose and tin post 
presented an identical editor environment.

Actually it would be nice to use the word Fill throughout, since that
is what it does.  It does not justify the margins.

Date: 22 Jun 94 06:39:51 GMT
Message-Id: <1994Jun22.063951.1@bbs.ug.eds.com>

What do I have to do in my .pinerc file in order to get messages to go into
different inboxes based on who they are to?

ex:
username is ivler alias is systemsmangler

when mail is sen to ivler it should go to ivler's INBOX
when mail is sent to systemsmangler it should go to ivler's SYS inbox where SYS
is an inbox for all email sent to systemsmangler

This would permit a presort of the incomming mail by alias. Thus allowing
numerous people to have mail sent to them about projects that they are on, and
have the project mail sent to the project files automagically.

I have read the man pages for PINE, and have looked at the .cr file as well, I
believe it can be done, but I can't get the to-value stuff to work. Any advice
would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Hi there,

I've recently been using Pine to mail postscript files to people, attaching
them to a small ascii message.  I would like the message to be saved as per
default to my sent-mail folder, but not the attachment.  As it happens
currently, the whole thing gets saved automatically, and then I have to
expunge the large attached file from my sent-mail folder using a text editor.
This seems very clumsy.  I've checked the on-line help, the technical notes,
and the configuration file, but there's nothing which seems to do what I want.

Can anyone help?

Thanks for your trouble.

cheers,

In the .pinerc file, there is a section called "feature-list=".  The 
features are listed above this line.  There is a feature: 
"enable-unix-pipe-cmd" which is included in "old-growth".

Perhaps xbiff is naively stat'ing your mail spool file and assuming

If that is the problem you should look for a better version of xbiff.

Hi!

	Is there anyway to *START* a composition of a message with an 
alternate editor instead of pico.  Instead of having to use ^_?
It's not that it is one more key to press, actually it's quite a few.
(Hard to explain... I'm running a random .signature generator, and it needs
to be routed through the program before running pico in pine.)  Basically,
I have to press ^_, then exit the READ IN my .signature file AGAIN!  It's 
really a pain....  Any suggestions?

Jim-

	It's easy. Open your favorite text editor. Type the recipient's 
address on the first line. Type 3 returns, then the subject, then return 
(or 2). Type the body of your message. Save it, go online, then use your 
comm software to send the textfile, or copy it all and 'paste it' to the 
modem (if you've got a Mac, that works great).

Create the file offline with your fav editor e.g. emacs, then 
read it in to pine with the ctrl-r command.

Pine is a mail program.  If someone sent you some uuencoded text via
pine, they just as easily could have used UNIX Mail, elm, Eudora,
MS-Mail, or whatever mail program their computer supported.  Pine runs
on various platforms.  I use the UNIX version and am very pleased with
it (I prefer it to UNIX Mail or elm).

Is it possible to block or cut a few lines from a long file and save them 
to a file name?

I often need to do this, but I've never been able to figure out how to do 
it with pine.  

I know this can be done by using emacs, vi, or in windoze by saving to 
the clipboard; however I would rather find a way to do it with pine/pico.

	I use the old-growth set, but still get this message:

'Can't access terminal or input is not a terminal. Redirection of
standard input is not allowed. For example "pine < file" doesn't work.'

	Will Pine 3.90 be allowed to do this?

I too run PC-Pine with TCP/IP lanmanager with ndispkt.  It works, but
I have given up on being able to use lanmanager stuff while using any
packet-driver applications.  If anyone has words to the contrary, I'd
like to hear them.--

Is it possible to use pine within a shell script to deliver mail messages?
For the moment, we are using the Berkeley mailer to generate mail from a

This sounds like a problem which we have, also, since the Unix mainframe
here uses MMDF mail, so that the format of the mailbox is different from
the sendmail format recognized by PINE. The systems people here have
helped out by providing a utility called smdeliver, which adds an
incoming message to a specified mailbox using sendmail format, so that
PINE can read it. I do not know the soruce of the utility, whether it
was produced in-house, or acquired from somewhere. The utility, as it
stands, isn't able to convert existing mailboxes from one format to the
other, but I haven't pushed anybody to get this.

Can I ask if there are any plans to make an option for PINE to read MMDF
format mailboxes?

Try typing "man pine" (without the quotation marks) at the prompt.

few problems (restricting the user to one directory, for instance).
Plus I would like to handle some options without the brute force
"you can't do this" (but that may have to wait for the second version).

Are there others looking at this?

Send me mail or post to the list if you have something.  I'll send
a summary of what I get.

Thanks for your help.

Message-Id: <2uc47p$qef@mozz.unh.edu>

	Is Pine's debug mode secure?  Whenever I read my mail using pine
and then exit pine I see files named .pine-debug1 (where the number may go
up to 4).  The sysadmin says that he didn't install pine (some other
system admin must have) but if he had he wouldn't have left it in debug
mode.  Nevertheless, he says, it is not a security problem.  In another
case (perhaps related, perhaps unrelated) I have been told that when an
IRC server is compiled in debug mode the sysadmin can read everything that
is said.)

	What's the scoop?

I am using pico distributed with pine 3.89 on Solaris OS,
and prefer the -t option, which eliminates the confirmation
dialog on exit from pico.  However, I can't see any way to
quit without saving edits.  I have RTFM, and didn't see 
anything there.  Is it possible? How.  If not possible,
will this be changed in future versions, soon?  It seems
like a natural binding for the ^Q key...

Yes, there is an SGI port of Pine.

There is not currently an X-pine, but Ian Leiman
<leiman@dshp.ntc.nokia.com> is working on a Motif based Pine derivative
called SPRUCE.

Our assumption is that the caller of "pico -t" has a way to cancel the
edit/message external to pico.  ^Q is not a good candidate because it is
the XOFF character and has special meaning over some communication
channels.

Hi There fellow pine users,

Does anyone know where I get get hold of the mods so that Pine will compile on
HP under HP-UX ?  I can't find any mention of the port in the contrib section 
that comes with the 3.9 distribution.

I know that I can get the binaries from lots of places but I would really like
a version which I can compile myself, mainly because it'll mean less ftp'ing, 
use less bandwidth etc.

Thanks for your help in advance, whats that I here something about 3.90 ?!!

Mark

actually the format would be 
pine -s "Subject goes here" user@site < filename.
Unfortunately Pine 3.07 doesn't support this < yet.
But you can acheive the same by using simple mail 
command instead of pine, as pine concentrates more
on the userinterface.

I don't see any difference in the security of Pine with debugging turned
on or off.  Unless you are using some sort of encryption, nothing you send
out in either email or IRC should be considered "secure"....

I subscribe to a mail list which generates 20-30 messages a day. I want

This is so I can have my regular incoming email separate from the stuff

How do I set this up? I've looked thru the help functions of pine and 
read the .pinerc file, but can't seem to figure this out. Is it even 
possible to set up multiple incoming folders in pine?

Please email me if you have any advice.

Thanks for any and all suggestions. :=)

Pine 3.89 includes an "hpp" port for HP/UX in the main distribution.  Just
"build hpp" in the top level source directory... 

Pine 3.90 should be available in a few weeks.

Following is the description of a problem several of our FreeNet
users are having.  I wonder if this is familiar to anyone and whether
anyone has a solution.  I'd really appreciate any help -- presumably
a fixed vt100 termcap entry would do the trick (although other vt100
emulations have no such problem).

This is pine 3.88 on SunOS 4.1.3

Thanks in advance.
---------

Pine is displaying a blank line between entries in any 
given folder list.  I'm getting around to mentioning this because today 
my mailbox was full enough to really be a problem.  

Here's what I'm using... Windows Terminal VT100 emulation

Quirks/details:
1)  sends index of folder mesg with extra spacing.  The result is that if 15 
msg, first 7 scroll off top of the screen while PINE thinks that all 15 are 
displayed.  Therefore, if highlight is on msg 1 thru 7 I can't see 
status of mesg or where the highlight bar is.

2) moving up the index with the cursor control arrows reverse texts and 
single spaces the entries.  The result is as follows.
	Let's say i have 15 mail messages and I hit the up arrow 5 times:
mesgs 1-12 (top portion of screen) will remain double spaced and 10-15 
will be reverse text-single spaced.  
(#10, 11, 12 will appear twice, one reverse text, one normal but double 
spaced)and were I to go to #5 and then hit ctrl-L the reverse text will be 
gone and I will remain on mesg #5 which will be outa sight off the top of 
the screen.

3)  Ctrl-L will fix garbage but will not correct spacing frustrations.

4)  The described problems occur both with vt100 and vt100x.

6)  They occur whether or not the functionkeys are displayed in TERMINAL.

7)  I occasionally have a single line near the cursor duplicated in the 
compose screen.

While I have occasional screen leftovers inthe html world of the freenet, 
I do not have spacing difficulties ever and Ctrl L does the trick.

Btw:  Telix really butchers the main (html) portion of the freenet with 
its VT102

Pine 3.90 will have full MMDF support, in both dialects.  There's a dialect of
MMDF which has the four CTRL/A's and a ``From '' line, and another dialect of
MMDF which just has the four CTRL/A's.

How do I add my own headers to outgoing email?  Things like Reply-To:
or Return-Receipt-To:

Ideally I'd like to set them as defaults for all mail, second-best
I'd like to include them every time I send mail.

In elm this is done thru the o)ptions menu, but I can't figure how to do
it in pine.

Merely as a point of information, on differnt occasions with different

CTRL-[6]'s to set a mark, but only one to UNset it. 

Took me a while to figure that one out.

As of today, I've installed the IMAPD server on our Sun (SS1/SunOS) and
am trying to use IMAP clients PC-Pine and Mailstrom(Mac).  Both programs
say they can't open the mailbox lock and that access is read-only.

I've already rummaged thru the system finding and killing all the 'orphan'
processes and there aren't any left that I can tell.

Where do I go from here guys ?

p.s.  The 'make' process for IMAPD has to be one of the cleanest I've ever
      seen.  Good work!!!

	Ah yes, this reminds me... a while ago, I posted these aliases
which convert my mh Inbox (the standard mail handler here) to PINE/UNIX
Mail format. At the time, however, the news service here was having
problems, and I don't think any news was getting outside Aber! So, here
they are again. They'll need slight modification, but only obvious things
such as your directory configuration, to make them work properly for you. 

alias a 'cd ~syb3/mail'
alias b 'mv /var/spool/pp/mail-mmdf/syb3 temp1'
alias c "tr -d '' < temp1 > temp2"
alias d "awk '"'/^Return-Path:/ {print "From syb3@decb.aber.ac.uk
        Mon Feb 24 00:00:00 1994";a=""} /./ {print a $0;a=""} \\!/./
        {a=a "\n"}'"' < temp2 > temp3" alias e 'cat temp3 >> Inbox'
alias f 'rm temp*'
alias g cd
alias h clear
alias in 'a;b;c;d;e;f;g;h'

alias d is, obviously, all on one line. Oh, and in that alias, at the end
of the second line, the format is: backspace, backspace, exclamation mark,
slash, full-stop, slash, but this may not show up in your newsreader.
Cheers!

Control/Q is the XON character, not XOFF.  XOFF is Control/S.  But both 
of these characters have special meaning over some communication channels.

In elm you can put an [encode] in your message and elm will ask you for an
encryption key, and then the receiver must receive it in elm, and it will ask
you for the decryption key when you access the message.  Does pine have a
comparable facility?

I don't think, though I may be wrong, that this does the job that is 
wanted -- for I have been trying to do the same thing for some time.

A fuller explnation, of my problem anyway:

If I compose an ASCII messsage for e-mail on my computer at home -- using 
any pure ASCII editor, like TEDIT or GALAXY -- and I wish to send it 
directly through my internet connection to the recipient, I have no 
problem with it if I use the UNIX "mail" command. I simply put "mail 
recipient@place.place" on the first line, a filler for the "Subject:" 
line of the mail program on the second line; and then a <CR>.<CR> at the 
end. I then do an ASCII upload through ProComm+ -- and everything works 
smoothly.

On he other hand, if I just compose the message itself, at home and in 
ASCII, and try to upload it into pine; then I get a raft of errors, most 
of which look like ANSI codes, though they probably are not. I must then 
cancel the message, exit PINE, upload the message as a file to my UNIX 
account, re-enter PINE, and then use the <CTRL-R> feature of which you 
have spoken.

Isn't there any reasonable way to run the ASCII text, through the modem 
directly into PINE, and then send the message?

The default headers will be fully configurable in Pine 3.90.

To get reverse date sorting, set sort-key=date/reverse.

Date: Thu, 23 Jun 1994 22:24:18 GMT
Message-Id: <CrvFKJ.7xw@actcom.co.il>

Hi there,

I have this very weird problem with biff which occurs only when I am using 
procmail. In what seems to be a completely random time, the notification
for some regular mail message that I already received pops up again, as if
I received the message again. This occurs without any logical pattern except
that it is not observed when procmail is not in my .forward file.

The only things I have in my .procmailrc are very simple: About two mailing
lists directed to different mail folders according to a simple regexp.

I'd appreciate it if someone gave me an idea as to what this means.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: Domain name fulfillment
Date: 25 Jun 1994 23:51:25 GMT
Message-Id: <2uiftt$fqq@news.cerf.net>

I would like to keep the machine name out of the address fulfillment in
pine.  I have several machines in the same domain  so as far as the
user is concerned the addition of the machine name when pine fill out
the address for a local user is confusing.

Example (real too):
Machine name: fowler
Domain name: news.latimes.com

When the user types: malcor
Pine fill that out to: malcor@fowler.news.latimes.com
I'd rather it filled out to: malcor@news.latimes.com

I did some work on the .pinerc and pine.conf and if I set the domain to
"news.latimes.com" it still found the machine name "fowler", but if I
set it to "news.latimes.com " (Note: the space and the quotes are
required).  Then it did not find the machine name, but it also did not
complete my name as: Daniel Malcor <malcor@news.latimes.com> (just a
bland and uninformative malcor@news.latimes.com). Is this something
that you can rush into 3.90?

Yes, Pico will be upgraded along with Pine.  Of course that does not have 
anything to do with "Marking files as answered"...

In Pine 3.07 you needed to set "signature-at-bottom=yes" if I remember

If I understand your request correctly, you need to put the variables 
into the global config file.  For example in my pine.conf file at work, 
we have:
INBOX=/var/mail/$LOGNAME

Hope it helps.

Message-Id: <2ude0k$l0o@bud.peinet.pe.ca>

Apologies if this has been covered before (is there a FAQ?).

I've gleaned quite few nifty tips from this group, and I'm hoping someone 
will help with this one.

I receive a load of USDA market reports, and other files via mail, for a 
non-Internet connected BBS which I manage.

I'd like to set up a few Telix scripts to login into the account and 
download the files once they've been extracted from Pine.

Is there a method to tell Pine how to extract a mail message, based on 
what's in the subject field?  This wuld be very handy, as all the 
messages come Subject labelled with a 'code-number', which is what the 
BBS uses to find and then display the file to a user.

Thanks for your help, and big pats on the back to the Pine developers, 
who in mymind have put together a reliable, freindly package!

Unfortunately, though, the "hpp" port for HP/UX doesn't fix the problems
pine has in dealing with HP terminals (mutant terminals that they are).
I have about a 40k patch which fixes 99% of the problems with HP terminals.
The remaining problems are basically ignorable and not really fixable without
major reworking of the pine and pico I/O libraries, etc.

My patch is for pine-3.87, but I expect that it could be adapted to 3.89
without too much trouble.  Let me know if you want a copy.

Hi, all

I'm using PC-Pine.  I haven't found a way to update the new incoming
message without quitting Pine and restarting it again.  Eudora allows
automatical checking new mail in x minutes.  Does PC-Pine allows that?

Also, is there way to tell Pine to leave a copy of newmail on the server?

Thanks a lot in advance!

I just tried this and it worked to perfection. (Although not until I 
learned I had to add a line containing a period . at the end of the 
file before I could close it properly.) It is easier than my previous 
fixes, tho of course we aren't strictly speaking in this newsgroup any more!

(And can't use the addressbook either.)

Thanks, Frank.

Hi all,

Since Pine Is No longer Elm, the feature of using different sigs for
local and non-local mail is gone. I think this is silly (basically
because I need it :) Did I overlook how to enable this feature or is it
planned for new versions?

Any comments?

Greetings,
Steef

I have had the very same problem. I got so frustrated with it
I gave up pico and took up "vi" for my text editing. Actually,
I'm a lot happier with it.  I am still able to use pine for mailing,
but I find vi very versatile for editing newsgroup responses such as this one.

I'd appreciate seeing the key-by-key sequence to mark text blocks in Pine.
I've RTFM and experimented, but I can't get ^K to delete more than one line
at a time. Even worse, it smirks at me occasionally, telling me that I 
*could* mark blocks to be more efficient.

Try using "ESC ESC ^" as a work-around.  That should work until you can

	The key sequence is CTRL ^ - yes, ^^. On a terminal I log in on
at work, I have to use shift-ctrl-^.. I haven't bothered to fool around
with the key definitions...so I have to use shift to get the system to
recognise the ^. Then just cursor down and you should see the marked
text go into reverse video. CTRL k and it's gone.

Thanks -- Ctrl ^ and CtrlShift ^ don't work, no matter how many times I 
press them. Ctrl ^ does nothing; CtrlShift ^ just adds a "V" where the 
cursor is. Moving the cursor then doesn't mark a block, and finally 
pressing Ctrl K just deletes the line where the cursor is, as it does 
normally. But the variety of keystrokes described sounds like it's a 
disagreement between my PC software, my Unix host, and Pine, regarding 
the meaning of certain keystrokes. I'll post the problem in the newsgroup 
for my Unix host, see if anyone local has any ideas.

Bingo! That works! Thanks!

Just to spell it out for others reading this, that's ESC ESC Shift/6.

Pine doesn't have such filtering functions itself, but on UNIX systems
that use sendmail as the mail transport agent there are three programs
you can use to get this effect: filter, which is part of the Elm
distribution, procmail, and deliver.  Here's how to use deliver to
filter incoming mail:

First of all you'll need to get deliver installed on your system, if
it's not already.  It's usually installed setuid root, so that will
take cooperation from your system administrator.  (Though the
installation notes say that you can install it in a personal directory
and do without root-setuidness.)  The source code to deliver is
available from any major ftp archive; use archie to find one near you.
Deliver should compile and run on most UNIX systems without any
problems.

Once deliver is installed, say in /usr/local/bin/deliver, then you
tell sendmail to pass all incoming mail through deliver by putting

"|/usr/local/bin/deliver your-username"

into your .forward file in your home directory.  (The quotes are
needed, and don't forget to add your user name as an argument or
sendmail may do unintuitive and unpopular things to your mail.)

Now what deliver does with your mail depends on the the rules inside a
file called .deliver in your home directory.  Here's (a shortened
version of) my .deliver file:

#!/bin/sh
user="$1"
TO=`header -f To -f CC $HEADER`

case "$TO" in
*clarissa*)	echo $user:mail/clarissa;;
esac

case "$TO" in
*usenet*) echo $user:mail/news; exit;;
esac

# Default case
echo $user

It's a Bourne shell script that looks at the 'To:' (or 'Cc:') line in
the header of the incoming mail message.  If the message came from the
Clarissa Explains it All mailing list, then the 'To:' line says

To: clarissa@tcp.com

and that matches the '*clarissa*' pattern in the first case statement.
So that message is put in my clarissa folder.  If the message came
from our Usenet software, then the 'To:' line says

To: usenet

and that matches the '*usenet*' pattern in the second case statement.
So that message goes to my news folder.

The last line in the .deliver file sends a copy of everything to my
inbox, so anything else besides the Clarissa or news mail goes to my
inbox as usual, and a copy of the Clarissa mail goes to my inbox too.
That way I can see everything in one place, and still have a copy put
in the right folder automatically.  (Since the news mail is usually
uninteresting I bypass the copy to my inbox with the 'exit' command at
the end of that case statement.)

Deliver can do much more but this should give you an idea of how it
can be used to sort incoming mail.  The .deliver file itself doesn't
have to be a Bourne shell script; anything that has the effect of
writing the user name or a file pathname to standard output would do.

How do you setup a KILL file in Pine to block email from people you don't 
want to hear from?  I did 'man Pine' to check the manual and searched on 
'kill' and found nothing.  Is this possible?

Is it possible to export or download my Pine address list into a PC file?

Is it possible to import or upload or update the list from a PC file?

I can *print* the list from Pine with no difficulty, but I'd like to be 
able to do some list manipulation on my PC.

Your addressbook is stored in a plain text file called ".addressbook" (no 
quotes).  The format should be self-explanatory, just watch out for the 
TABs between columns...

This is another function of mail filtering.  I just posted a message

Doesn't seem to be, in 3.89:  

pine jdavis@cs.arizona.edu < /dev/null

generates

Can't access terminal or input is not a terminal. Redirection of
standard input is not allowed. For example "pine < file" doesn't work.

So it looks like pine is doing isatty(0) (or its moral equivalent) on
startup.  (Maybe that will change in the all singing, all dancing pine
3.90!)

You could try to fake pine out by running it under pty or expect, but
/usr/ucb/mail would probably be faster in a shell script anyway.

One enhancement that I would find useful would be to take the To:
addresses into the addressbook like I use (T) to take in the From:
address.  Ideally, I would be able to add each address individually,
but more important (to me) would be the ability to add them all at
once into a mailing list.  Thanks ....

Subject: PCPINE/LWP/Winsock: It all works together!
Date: 21 Jun 1994 20:35:53 -0400
Message-Id: <2u8119$ggk@hopi.dtcc.edu>

I'm totally confused!

My tcp/ip stack is Novell's Lan Workplace for DOS, loaded in when
DOS boots.

I am running Novell's Winsock which goes with LWP.

I scarfed pine_n.zip, PC Pine's support for LWP.

I put it all together, and ran PC Pine from Windows, and expected
it to blow up, or at least some net connections to drop when I ran
PC Pine in a DOS box.

But surprise, it all works quite well together and I am confused! The way 
I see it laid out is like this (where #1, #2, #n are winsock apps)

  #1  #2  #n
    \  |  /      PINE_N.EXE (with background box checked)
    WINSOCK      /
        \       /
         TCPIP.EXE (LWP driver)
            |
           ODI
            |
           NIC


So, I am assuming LWP multiplexes incoming net messages at the IP level
and knows to route imap packets to PINE (running in a dos box) and others
to Winsock as needed.  (what is *really* neat is Novell support is hooked
to the side of ODI and everything STILL works since *it* routes based on
frame type (ethernet_ii vs ethernet_802.3)!!!!)

If this is true, it is pretty darn neat.  Now if I could somehow shoehorn
Windows for Workgroups support in here, I'd be REAL happy!!!!

(Hey, a usenet first. I am not starting a thread asking a question. Just
thought someone contemplating the above scenario might be interested...)

	For some reason, I can't suspend all of the time in PINE.  I have
suspend-enabled by the old-growth setting.  I have been able to do it in
the past.  Now it says it doesn't recognize the command.  Any ideas?

Date: 27 Jun 1994 12:05:55 GMT
Message-Id: <2umfb3$j7g@news.udel.edu>


Last week I wrote about a problem I was having with my IMAPD clients. 
They'd try to open a folder lock in /tmp and would fail.  Then the
clients would only be able to open the INBOX as read-only.  The problem
was due to a bug in the non-ANSI source of the imap-3.3 distribution. 
The temporary files that imapd was creating had permissions of 000
instead of 666.  The following modification fixes that problem.

Many thanks to Mark Crispin for providing the new code!!!

I quite happily use procmail to filter out my various message from mailing 
lists and place them in multiple inbox or folders.  You can get procmail-3.02
from (or ask archie):
	ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/unix/procmail.tar.gz

It's very powerfull and pretty easy to use for simple things like redirecting 
mail from mailing lists to new folders for use in PINE, to set up the folders
in Pine just read .pinerc file and it pretty easy to follow just setup the
incoming foler with a label(optional) and the path and when you run pine it 
will give you a choice of inbox's to read, fun fun fun.

Good Luck

Mark

Please forgive me if this is a over-hashed topic, or if it's covered
in a FAQ someplace.  (Pointers to any FAQs are appreciated.)

We have users who wish to send mail with Pine which appears to come
from a different system.  For example, user has accounts on systems
Sys1, Sys2 and Sys3; where Sys3 is the "official" place to send mail
to (as advertised in campus records), but Sys1 is the environment the
user wishes to use (with Pine).

Is there any way for the user to send mail from Sys1 but have it appear
to come from Sys3, and have standard replies go to Sys3?  I was able to
get most of the way there by messing with the "user-domain" variable in
the ~/.pinerc.  This gives Sys3 as the "From" system, but still uses the
local userid.  The userids between the two systems don't match, so if
recipients try to reply to:

    Sys1-userid@Sys3

they'll get a "no such userid" bounce back.

I've tried tweaking the shell "$user" and environment "USER" variables,
but Pine grabs the userid from elsewhere.

Can anyone tell me if it can be done, and if so, how?

Thanks,

Hi all,
	Excuse me if this was discussed before.  I was wondering if there is any scheme to maintain public address lists such that all the unix users at our site can look up local addresses?  PC mail systems provide that feature so that people dont have to remember/know email addresses. 
	Please post or send responses to kotla@ctc.com.  Thanks.

It didn't work for me. We have Pine version 3.89, and the .pinerc files 
indicate that one can manipulate them to their heart's extent. Hrm. 

Now that I know I could possibly do this, I am annoyed that it doesn't work!

I was looking for a way to hook into the pager that pine uses when reading a received message.

I couldn't find anything offhand. Or I missed something really obvious. A lot of mailers will allow you to specify your own 
pager so you can customize it.

Which I would like to do. It would be a simple way to hook in a decryption program to read encoded messages that you received.

Thanks in advance

Pine 3.90 will allow you to add custom headers.  It should be available 
in a few weeks.

Pine 3.89 will check for incoming mail every 2.5 minutes.  Pine normally
does leave mail in place unless you tell it to do otherwise...

Put the distribution list in the 'bcc' (blind carbon copy) line.  You can get
to 'bcc' by type Ctrl R while in the header.  None of the recipients will see
who it went to.

Just rewrite the scrolltool routine in mailview.c!  But seriously,

Perhaps the 'pipe' command (in 3.90?) will be an adequate workaround.

The problem has to do with your terminal software. The ASCII send 
function needs to send the text as if you had simply typed it at the 
keyboard for you to be able to send it straight to pine. The problem is 
that some terminal programs try to 'upload' the text instead, using some 
kind of file transfer protocol like x or zmodem. That's where all the 
control characters are coming from. If you seem to be loosing a lot of 
characters then the terminal software is sending the text too faxt for 
the editor to keep up. Try to find some way to control the speed at which 
characters are sent. You may have to switch terminal software to get what 
you need. Perhaps your software has a macro or script language that you 
can cause to send a file one character at a time. It might be too slow 
though.

First thing, the question was "how do we get pine to do this", not "what
products out there can do this" - FWIW, this is not a personal flame, three
people so far have recomended "other" products...

I love this. at least four seperate readers have expreessed that they want to
do this in pine. "just read .pinerc file and it pretty easy to follow" makes
all those that have asked for help a bunch of dummies that can't follow
directions. I'm afraid not. It isn't simple, I have tried to do it, and
failed... and I too would love to know why it didn't work, and how to make it
work.

The answer is that the people recommending other products are correct! 
Pine does _NOT_ have any delivery filtering capability!!!  The appropriate
place to conduct filtering is before the message is delivered to your
folder, which is outside the current scope of the Pine project. 
Admittedly we are not completely satisfied with any of the solutions
currently available, but we do not have the resources to tackle the
problem at this time.

The .pinerc entries are merely pointers to the folders that the _external_
delivery filter deposits messages in.  

I hope that helps!

    That would be really nice. When I get email from someone sending to a 
large group, it would be great to get all the names into a group at once. 
Same for a forwarded message: grab the the address it originated from 
instead of who forwarded the thing to you.

Pine 3.89 only has sound support on the PC and Sun workstations.  Pine 
3.90 will allow more complete sound support via mailcap support.

I'm sure that this can be found some where in .pinerc, but I can't seem 
to find it so I'll ask here.  Occasionly my main connection to the 
machine that carries my mail is down and I have to dial into a very old 
and slow modem (1200 bps).  My question is how do I get pine to not 
invert selected items and just put a small marker by them and/or prevent 
it from writing messages about what its doing (I know what its doing, I 
usually gave the command to do it :) ) five seconds is five seconds when 
you have to worry about call waiting.  :)

Is there a quick way to move to the top/bottom or beginning/end of a file

Message-Id: <2up65c$rsr@stc06.CTD.ORNL.GOV>


I think it would be nice to have an optional FCC entry in the address book such
that when I compose mail to an alias in the address book, the FCC header field
would automatically be filled with the FCC entry from the address book.

For example, composing mail to "joe" would produce

To      : Smith Joe <joes@machine.xxx.yyy.zzz>
Cc      : 
Bcc     : 
Fcc     : mail-to-joe
Attchmnt: 
Subject : What do you know, joe?

If the FCC entry in the address book was left blank, then the default of
sent-mail would apply.

Hey, this idea could even be expanded further to include CC and BCC fields!

David, it certainly did. I hope that you understand where the confusion comes
in. It appears in the .pinerc file that there is a methode for autosrting by
field, but it is not clearly explained that this is not done by pine, but a
link for external products to use. I can't speak for everyone else, but I
appreciate the clarification.

I *like* the Fcc: idea, and after some thought came up with instances I
would want the same capability for Cc: & Bcc:.  A thought, then:  It's
been established that Pine 3.90 will have user-definable headers; why not
be able to set up a custom set of special header lines for a given address
book entry?

You can always use Elm's filter command to filter incoming mail, even if
you don't use Elm as your mail reader! The only requirements are:

	1). Your system must understand how to use the .forward file in a home
		directory.

	2). You must know where your system administrator keeps the filter
		command. (Usually it's in /usr/local/bin or /usr/lbin, but it
		all depends on the whims of your SA).

Sure, it looks a little strange having to setup a $HOME/.elm directory,
but it works.

I gave someone directions how to do this and he said he would post it to
the pine newsgroup. If it's not there, I'll post the directions I have
to this mailing list.

Yes, I definitely would like to see the availability of Chinese (Hanzi) 
version of pine. And, as a computer consultant at UC Berkeley, I know it is
the desire of many other users. Please go ahead and develop the program 
and I am sure it will be appreciated by a large number of Chinese 
speakers in this country. Please keep us informed about your progress. 
Thanks.

Our system is having several instances of mail that can not be delivered for a 
variety of reasons.  The more frequent of these being: 

    "transport smtp: connect: Connection refused"
    "transport smtp: connect: No route to host"
    
I realize that these are problems that might be by passed by modifying s-mail 
so that is retrys more often or for a longer period, Can someone tell me how
to do this?  I have a large book on sendmail but it seems incompatible with 
the s-mail system in Linux.  

Are there any other users out there that have had these type of problems, If so
or if there is someone that just knows better, please post possible solutions 
to my problem.  

We are running a Pine mail system under Linux on a 486-33.  We have c.330 users
of which only a couple are having problems, but we would like everyone to be 
happy.  Thanks now for whatever you send me later.

David, what you're saying here is great news, but I'm afraid I still need 
some help (I'm quite new at this, and just learning as I go along).

1.So far, I've read man filter and from what I understand, I need to write a
filter-rules file, which is placed in my $HOME/.elm/ directory. I'm 
getting my messages from a mail-list named Chile-heads, so I wrote this 
file with one line:

	rules = if (from = Chile-heads@chile.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu) then save
		Chile-heads

(Chile-heads being a folder I set up in Pine).

2.Now what do I do next? Do I go into .pinerc and write:

	incoming-folders=Chile-heads filter/$HOME/mail/Chile-heads (?)

Do I have to make any mention of my default INBOX, where I still want 
"regular" messages to be placed?

3.I have seen references to a .forward file somewhere, but I'm have no idea 
what that file should contain, and where to put it?

This probably is very elementary for those of you who've done this 
already, but I must say that it is very confusing for me. The 
instructions that come with filter, procmail, and pine are all so 
cryptic, no matter hw many times I pore over them.

So, if you'd be kind enough to lend some further assistance, I'll be most 
grateful!:=) Thanks a million for everyone's input so far, I hope to see 
the end of this tunnel soon...:-(

I'm sure this has been asked before, but here goes anyway.  Is there
any way to use the Ispell program to check the spelling of a message?
I've tried setting the environment variable SPELL to "ispell -a" with
no success.  So, if anyone has figured out a magic incantation to make
this work that he/she would like to share with me, I'd be quite grateful.

I'm not sure that that was the poster's problem. ProComm sends ASCII 
files and sends them in such a manner that they can be received by any 
editor (I think) except Pico. For example, I can use ASCII uploads to 
mail a letter using the mail command in Unix shell.

If I send into Pine, or into a pico file at the shell, the screen fills 
up with wild characters and throws bits of my message all over the place.

If I go right ahead and send it, however, the message seems to unscramble 
itself and comes out okay at the other end. I've done this sending 
letters to myself, but I am not quite prepared to risk it off-site. So I 
use the mail utility mentioned in an earlier posting.

	The easy way to use ispell with pine is to make ispell your
alternate editor. Then all you have to do is hit ^_ to invoke spell
checking. The change you need to make in .pinerc is:

# editor specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer.
# This is normally an alternative to Pine's internal composer (Pico) 
editor=ispell

	I have vi set as my alternate editor so I invoke ispell using a 
vi macro.

It sounds like you want to (1) upload a file from some other computer and 
then (2) bring that file into Pine for mailing.  #1 has too many 
variations to make it efficient to try to answer it without more 
information, and someone "local" to your working environment will 
probably be able to help you more efficiently.  For #2:  once you have 
the file in a directory on the same computer that's running pine for you, 
the Ctrl-R command starts R)eading it "in" to your Pine document.  Once 
you've typed Ctrl-R, the menu changes and Ctrl-T gives you a list of 
currently accessible files.  If you know the file is somewhere, and it 
doesn't show up in that list, you'll need to use your host systems 
file-management commands to move it to the right directory.  You may see 
various ugly things in the file once you bring it in to Pine -- that will 
be because the upload process hasn't dealt completely with the variations 
in conventions about how to store text in files.  If that happens, you'll 
need to ask more, and more specific, questions about the upload processes 
that suit your situation.

It sounds worse than it is.  But it did take me a while to figure out.  
And I still get "Warning: last line of file is {something wrong}" 
messages about half the time.  Sometimes there's a ^Z there.  Deleting it 
seems to get rid of the problem.

Incidently, the reverse process starts with Ctrl-E, to E)xport the text 
of your pine message to a file which can be downloaded, etc.

Good luck,

I have had fairly good luck uploading text files using Procomm's Ascii upload
directly into Pine's compose mode - which fill the screen with ANSI 
looking stuff - but pressing ^J (Justify) usually removes the ANSI stuff, 
making this the simplest upload procedure of all. I don't know how 
reliable it is either, but it seems to usually work for me.

---------- From the forthcoming Pine FAQ -----------

How do I use Ispell with Pine (and Pico)?

Here are a couple ways to use Ispell within Pine: 

1. Set your alternate-editor to ispell, then ^_ in the composer invokes
ispell. To do this, set 'editor=/usr/local/bin/ispell' in your .pinerc
file. This may be set within Pine via the OPTIONS task of the SETUP
command from the main menu.  Check to be sure that the ispell program
is installed on your system, and use the correct directory path.

Now, when you press ^_ (^-) in pine, you will execute the ispell program
in its native mode. Press ? for help. Press I to insert unknown words into
the personal dictionary. You can still press ^T to use the standard pine
spell-checking program (which will -not- use your personal dictionary).
See 'man ispell' for more information on the ispell program. 

2. Pine already checks the SPELL environment variable so you can create
the following script and name it spell. 

        #!/bin/sh
        ispell -l | sort | uniq 

To make ^T in pine use 'ispell' and your '$HOME/.ispell_words' dictionary: 
  - make the above script file 'spell' in your home directory 
  - make it executable: 'chmod u+x spell' 
  - set the environment variable SPELL: 'setenv SPELL $HOME/spell' 
    (you may include this command in your .profile, .cshrc or .login file) 

Now, when you press ^T in pine, you will execute the ispell program, and
it will recognize words stored in the private dictionary. The screen
display will look like pine is using the standard spell-checking program.
Unfortunately, this method does not allow the user to Insert words into
the private dictionary. However, this might be useful with a central
script file (setenv SPELL ...) and a central private dictionary (ispell -p
...) to provide a common private dictionary for an entire workgroup. The
manager could add items to the private dictionary; ordinary pine users
would use the private dictionary (^T), but they could not change it. 

To use ispell with pico, implement the 'ispell' program via ^T (CTRL-T)
(using the script file) in addition to implementing it via ^_ (CTRL-_)
(using the .pinerc file). 

Use ^_ in pine (it won't work in pico) for full-featured ispell.  Use ^T
in pico to use the ispell program and your .ispell_words dictionary (but
without the full ispell functionality). 

You can use ^T-ispell in pine also, but why bother when ^_ works better.

	I want to change the headers for my reply mail.  They currently 
read, "On <date>, <name> wrote:"  I would like it to read "On <date>,

	I have already changed it in the .pinerc, and the tinrc where
it asks for mail quote=balhblahblah.  Neither works.  Any ideas?

For your example, put the following in your filter-rules file:

	if (from = Chile-heads@chile.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu) then save Chile-heads

and the following in your .pinerc file:

	incoming-folders="Chile Heads"	Chile-heads

and the following in your .forward file:

	"|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /usr/users/dwh/filter.errors"

(the above paths may need to be altered for your environment...)

Pine 3.90 will include support for MH folders by default.  It is also
possible to build Pine 3.89 with the latest IMAP toolkit to get the new
driver....

No.  Look at the distinction between 'save' and 'savecopy', though.

"| /path/name/to/filter -vo /your/homedir/.elm/filter-log"

This goes in $HOME/.forward.  Your home directory will probably need
to be world-executable.

The filter manpage isn't the place to be looking for tutorial info;
look at 'The Elm Filter Guide'.  Whoever installed elm on your system
should know where it is.  In particular, study the -o options and
learn about filter -r.

While it may be easier to get started with filter than deliver (or
procmail), I'd recommend deliver over filter.  (I haven't used
procmail, but it does have a good reputation.)  One reason: we've
noticed that filter doesn't deal with a full mail spool partition
gracefully -- deliver will return with an ENOSPC error to sendmail,
which can be passed back to the original sender, but filter appears to
deliver the message successfully.  Of course since there is no room
left in the mail spool for the new message, it isn't really
delivered...

I could have sworn that I recently saw a message which said that you
could read mh style folders from within pine, but I can't figure out
how.  Did I imagine this or can it be done?

(I'd like to use exmh on my desktop and pine when I'm logged in over a
modem.)

The first time you run pine (if it's on your system) it should be
created.  Or, if you download it, the same thing should occur.  At
least, that's what happened in my case.

I just recompiled pine 3.89 with IMAP 3.3 instead of the regular IMAP.
However, that doesn't seem to do anything, at least not automatically.
How do I tell pine in my .pinerc that I want to use MH style mailboxes?
Just giving a directory as a folder name is rejected.

Tim is correct that .pinerc gets created when you use pine for the first 
time.  However, he did not mention that it would be created in your home 
directory.

Type this:
   pico ~/.pinerc

{Basically, once you run pine, ".pinerc" is created in the user's home 
directory.}

Ok, pine is a good piece of software, but it has a flaw that makes it
unusable for me. I can't stand pico. It wouldn't be so bad if my
terminal could generate the ^_ (was it) that switches to alternate
editor, but it cant.

So what I'm asking is: Is there a way to bind that alt.editor function
to some other control-key? or maybe make pine use some other editor (vi
in my case) instead of the horrid pico?

  In Japanese, there are 3 major Japanese character sets, JIS, EUC and 
Shift-JIS.  I did many hacks, and then we can use Shift-JIS on Pine3.89 now.

  I'm still hacking for another Japanese character sets.  I know about 
Japanese characters, but don't know about Chinese characters.  Please let 
me know about Chinese characters on internet.  I will try to hack for 
Chinese characters.

 To pine staff,
   Is there any problem that I will hack pine for asian characters?

This topic came up a few months ago, I believe.  The newest version of
Pine, v.3.90, will have as an option the ability to change the default
editor to something else (in my case, I prefer Emacs, but that's
another story), instead of having to press obscene control characters
to get to it; it would completely replace pico.  Which means I can't
wait for our system to get it! :-)

Subject: NFS mounting /usr/mail on hp
Date: 29 Jun 1994 14:32:34 GMT
Message-Id: <2us0m2$5vf@eis.wfunet.wfu.edu>

I have tried to NFS mount the /usr/mail directory on an HP9000 running 
hp-ux 9.0.  The Pine tech notes imply that this shold work fairly well, 
however, whenever I try to run pine on the mounted file system, it 
simply hangs up forever, and has to be killed from another session.  it 
then becomes a "zombie" process.

The problem seems to have something to do with file locking.  When pine 
hangs up, the mail file cannot be accessed even after the /usr/mail area 
is unmounted.  I had to rename the file and copy over the contents before 
pine would open it again.  I checked for lock files, and find only the 
.\usr\mail\username file.  Deleting it has no effect.

Any recommendations about how to get this to work will be 
greatly appreciated.

Subject: cancelling the saving of outgoing mail...
Date: 29 Jun 1994 15:24:16 GMT
Message-Id: <2us3n1$gv1@usenet.srv.cis.pitt.edu>

I think that this subject has come up before, but I didn't catch it then. 
Sorry for the repetition, if that is the case.

I was wondering if there was any way of getting around the default
function of saving a copy of outgoing mail to the folder "sent-mail".
Ideally, I'd like to be prompted at the end of each outgoing message,
asking if I would like to save the message or not.

I find my sent-mail folder rapidly filling up, and I'd like some way of
managing it better.

Thanks very much for any info!

Jim.

Message-Id: <1994Jun29.172342.5943@midway.uchicago.edu>
Date: Wed, 29 Jun 1994 17:23:42 GMT

I am using Pine on a Linux box (Unix for 386 etc.), and am trying to read 
mail posted to my University account from home over a slip connection. 
However, even though I have the .pinerc file setup with the address of 
the remote INBOX it won't work. I get the message "can't connect to 
midway.uchicago.edu,143." The most likely reason is that to connect the 
mail server wants to know my id and password. Is it possible for Pine to 
send this info to the server? If not, any other suggestions for mail with 
this setup would be appreciated.

Nick

There is a line in your .pinerc that states "default-fcc=".  It's
probably set at sent-mail right now.  If you change that to read
	default-fcc=""
That will fix the problem.  I don't know of a way to have it prompt
you if you want to save it...maybe if you specify the sent-mail file
to be a script of some sort.  Any one else want to take a crack at
this answer?  I mean, it works for forwarding files....

Actually, it looks like the problem is that midway.uchicago.edu does not
have an IMAP server installed.  You will be prompted for your account and
password after Pine successfully contacts the IMAP server.  Imapd in
included in the Pine source distribution, or you can get the IMAP toolkit
from ftp.cac.washington.edu int he file mail/imap.tar.Z.

Here's yet another list of instructions for setting up filter.


USING ELM'S FILTER PROGRAM TO FILTER INCOMING MAIL
==================================================

1] Note the full path for filter by typing:

which filter

If your system doesn't have filter ask your sys admin to install it.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

cd
pwd


3] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules

cd
mkdir .elm
cd .elm
pico filter-rules


4] Enter a modified version the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules:

if (to contains "seasigi") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.seasigi"
if (to contains "lynx-dev") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.lynx-dev"
if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-talk"
if (to contains "www-announce") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-announce"
if (to contains "faq-maintainers") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.faq-maintainers"

Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
stored.  Pine and Unix mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses /Mail
(upper case M).


5] To see what the filter rules will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  filter -r


6] Create a ~/.forward file by typing:

cd
pico .forward


7] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:

"|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

Note you do want to include the quotes and you want to replace
/usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1) 
and replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).


8] Send yourself an email message to make sure that regular messages
   get through to your inbox.


9] Regularly look at ~/.elm/filterlog and filter-errors to make sure things 
   are working.  Also you probably want to regularly delete these files
   so they don't fill up your disk space!


FOR MORE INFO SEE:
  man filter |less
  comp.mail.elm
  Elm Filter Guide


I hope this helps.  Please send me any suggestions for improving it - updated
versions will be on ftp://ftp.ii.com/pub/ii/Internet/filtering_mail.

Here's what's in my ~/.elm/filter-rules file:  (~ is shorthand for $HOME)

	if (to contains "RXYZ@") then forward "RXYZ@UMAB.BITNET"
	if (to contains "ABC") then forward "ABC@UFRJ.BITNET"
	if (to contains "DEF") then save "~/mail/DEF-Inbox"
	if (to contains "GHI") then save "~/mail/GHI-Inbox"
	if (to contains "JKL") then save "~/JKL-Inbox"
	if (to contains "@") then save "~/Inbox"

Explanation:
	Lines 1 and 2... couldn't get off the mailing lists, and the 
listowners wouldn't respond to my messages, so now I'm bouncing anything 
from those lists back to the list.
	Lines 3, 4, and 5... all are high-volume mailing lists, so I put 
those into their own "Inboxes."  By the way, I *do* *not* add these into 
the .pinerc file, since they are not relevant to my Real Job (tm), and I 
don't want to be notified when there's new mail in them (there's *always* 
new mail in them... they're high volume).
	Line 6 is because on our system, something is screwed up, and all
mail that didn't fit into rules 1-5 went into an ~/EMERGENCY_MBOX file, and
I didn't like that. 


>2.Now what do I do next? Do I go into .pinerc and write:
>
>	incoming-folders=Chile-heads filter/$HOME/mail/Chile-heads (?)

Prbably.  I don't... see above (rules 3-5).


>Do I have to make any mention of my default INBOX, where I still want 
>"regular" messages to be placed?

Maybe.  I do... see above (rule 6).


>3.I have seen references to a .forward file somewhere, but I'm have no idea 
>what that file should contain, and where to put it?

You put it in your home directory:  ~/.forward.  Here's what's in mine:

	"|/usr/local/bin/filter -o ~/.elm/filter-errors"


Also note that this format (I can't seem to get any others to work 
properly) will create (in your .elm directory) files called:  
filter-errors, filterlog, and filtersum.  Filterlog and filtersum keep on 
growing and growing and growing and growing, so that eventually you need 
to delete them.  Filterlog is *especially* bad.  I keep mine until it's 
about 0.5 meg, then rm it, *AND THEN I CREATE A NEW ONE*.  An empty file 
(one line, or a 0), just so that filter can have a file... it's pretty 
finnicky.  If there isn't a file for it, it starts putting all your mail 
back in that !@!$#!@ EMERGENCY_MBOX file again.

Trust me, I've been doing it for a while, and it's still pretty cryptic! 
I've had lots of great help from the help desk and system operators here
at the University.  (Keep up the good work, people!)

Hope this helped a little.

I was hoping someone could help me pick which MicroPhone version to buy. 
Pine help says for printing and receiving Mac users should buy MicroPhone

MicroPhone 2, versrion 5.0.  Which one will work better?

I would appreciate any advice

MH folders are referenced in a different way than other folders.

The syntax is #mh#folder.  The ~/.mh_profile file is consulted to get the MH
path, otherwise ~/Mail is used.  For example, #mh#foo becomes ~/Mail/foo if
you are using the default path.  You must have a .mh_profile file (the MH
program always creates it) otherwise it won't enable MH access.

Here's yet another list of instructions for setting up filter.


USING ELM'S FILTER PROGRAM TO FILTER INCOMING MAIL
==================================================

1] Note the full path for filter by typing:

     which filter

   If your system doesn't have filter ask your sys admin to install it.


2] Note the full path of your home directory by typing:

     cd
     pwd


3] Create ~/.elm/filter-rules

     cd
     mkdir .elm
     cd .elm
     pico filter-rules


4] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.elm/filter-rules:

if (to contains "seasigi") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.seasigi"
if (to contains "lynx-dev") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.lynx-dev"
if (to contains "www-talk") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-talk"
if (to contains "www-announce") then save "/j/nancym/Mail/INBOX.www-announce"
   
   Replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   Replace /Mail with the name of the directory where your mail folders are
   stored.  Pine and Unix mail use /mail (lower case m) and Elm uses /Mail
   (upper case M).
   
   Note that ``to contains...'' means either the To or Cc header contains...


5] To see what the filter rules will do type the following at your Unix 
   prompt:  

     filter -r


6] Create a ~/.forward file by typing:

     cd
     pico .forward


7] Enter a modified version of the following in your ~/.forward:

     "|/usr/local/bin/filter -o /j/nancym/.elm/filter-errors"

   Note you do want to include the quotes and you want to replace
   /usr/local/bin with the correct path for filter (see step 1) 
   and replace /j/nancym with your home directory path (see step 2).
   
   Note that on some systems you will need to make your .forward world 
   readable and your home directory world searchable in order for the
   mail transport agent to "see" it.  To do this type:
   
     cd
     chmod 644 .forward
     chmod +x .


8] Send yourself an email message to make sure that regular messages
   get through to your default inbox.


9] Regularly look at ~/.elm/filterlog and filter-errors to make sure things 
   are working.  You can automatically check filter-errors each time you
   log in by putting the following in your .login:

     tail ~/.elm/filter-errors

   Also you probably want to regularly delete filterlog and filter-errors so 
   they don't fill up your disk space!

  man filter |less

I hope this helps.  Please send me any suggestions for improving it - updated
versions will be on ftp://ftp.ii.com/pub/ii/Internet/filtering_mail.

Close, but leave out the 'filter'.  Mine looks like this, where 'Mail' is a 
subdirectory off my home directory:

incoming-folders=ERC    Mail/Inbox/erc-inbox,
                 TOPTEN Mail/Inbox/topten-inbox

No... the 'incoming-folders' section is for folders *other* than your 
default INBOX that receive new messages (quoting from the .pinerc comments).

| Also note that this format (I can't seem to get any others to work

The option '-q' (in the .forward file) *should* turn off the logs... I
assume this is what you mean by the "other formats" you couldn't get to
work, but I thought I would mention it for the benefit of others reading
this.

Running filter with the option flag -c from your prompt will clear the log 
files without deleting them.

NOTE: The -c flag must be paired with one of the "summarize action" flags,
-s or -S.  I.e., to clear the logs type ('%' represents your prompt):

% filter -cS            ... for info about every piece of mail filtered
   or
% filter -cs            ... for just a few percentages

NOTE-the-second:  You can use the -s or -S flags without -c to see the 
summary without clearing the logfiles.

common character sets that I'm aware of are Hanzi and Big5.  Without
any hacking to pine I can send Big5.  For example, here is my wife's name..=

Subject: separating out mail from mailing lists using procmail


To filter mail from *this* list using procmail what is required 
is these 3 lines in your .procmailrc file (not a PhD.)

:0:
Sender: owner-pine-info@cac.washington.edu
mail/pine

More detailed information:

0. If procmail is installed on your Unix system (find out just like for filter:
i.e. use "which procmail"; sample output: /usr/local/bin/procmail)

1. Create the file .forward in your home directory with the line:

"|IFS=' '&&exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f-||exit 75 #YOUR_USERNAME"

Now procmail will be in use.  At this point all mail is still delivered
to your system mailbox.

2. Now to start really using procmail create the file .procmailrc in your
home directory.  The .procmailrc file is comprised of little recipes to 
divert mailing lists to separate inboxes. These recipes key in on
some characteristic mail header of mail from the list in question.
For example this 3 line recipe in .procmailrc puts all mail from
a specific list into the inbox "anthro-l" and those messages are
not sent to the regular inbox

:0:                                      <--- marks start of recipe
*^Sender: ANTHRO-L.*                     <--- the selection condition
mail/anthro-l                            <--- where to put selections

then that mail can be read separately with the command
"pine -f anthro-l"
or switching folders within pine.

The above recipe can be duplicated over and over just changing
the Sender for the list in question. Other headers besides Sender
can be used.

A simple format for the .procmailrc is this pattern:

:0:
* HEADER:.*characteristic_pattern_in_mail_header.*
mail/folder

:0:
* HEADER:.*characteristic_pattern2_in_mail_header.*
mail/folder2

:0:
* HEADER:.*characteristic_pattern3_in_mail_header.*
mail/folder3

etc.

All mail not picked up by one of the recipes is delivered as though
procmail was not in use, i.e. still goes to the regular inbox.

procmail has a mailing list for questions about procmail.
Mail to procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de with
Subject: subscribe

If procmail is not installed ask your system administrator to install it or
get it yourself by anonymous ftp to:
ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz

Other things procmail can do:
Throw out all mail from somebody:

:0
*^From j-blow@someplace
/dev/null

Automatically send back a file based on getting mail with a specific subject:
(This is just for illustration)

:0
*!FROM_DAEMON
*^Subject: send faq
|(formail -r -A"Precedence: junk" -I"Subject: FAQ File";\
cat FAQ) | $SENDMAIL -t

An entire list/archive server is written in the procmail language called
SmartList available in the same ftp location as procmail.

Let's say I read a thread with ten messages. Whenever a new message is 
posted to a thread, all previous ten messages are shown next time I log 
on, plus whatever new messages. That means I have to scroll through all 
the old messages to get the new messages. Is there a way to go directly 
to whatever new messages there are in the thread?

And now, having reached the extent of my limited knowledge, I have a 
question for the *real* filter gurus... :^).

I'm going to be away from my account for the greater part of the rest of 
the summer, and was planning to use the 'vacation' program to send out a 
short autoreply to some of my mail.  The key word here being *some*... 
does anyone out there have any ideas as to how to forward a copy of the 
mail I *would* have just kept in my INBOX to the vacation program... and 
*still* get a copy of it in my INBOX?  I've figured out how to do one or 
the other, but not both.  Any suggestions...?

-Jay- (wondering if I should have taken this to the elm group...)

While this has nothing to do with pine (you didn't mention anything about 
using pine as your newsreader, so I'm not assuming you are), I'll give 
you an answer anyway.  If you're using tin as your newsreader, the tab 
key will jump to the next unread article.  Spacebar will go to the next 
article, previously read or not.  The return key will skip to the next 
thread, but won't mark skipped articles in the previous thread as having 
been read.

The current Pine distribution contains two AIX ports:

	aix	AIX/370 (on mainframes)
	a32	AIX 3.2 on RS/6000

The Pine distribution is available from ftp.cac.washington.edu  in the 
mail directory.  There is also a pre-compiled executable for AIX 3.2 in 
the mail/unix-bin directory.

Here's what I did when I was on vacation:

---begin excerpt of ~/.elm/filter-rules---
# Next line prevents infinite loops when you send messages to yourself!
if (from matches /^nancym$|^nancym@ii.com$/) then save "~/Mail/INBOX.fromme"

# NOTE 1: executec means "execute and copy message to INBOX"
# NOTE 2: You can replace /usr/local/bin/elm with another MUA like /usr/ucb/mail
if (to contains "nancym") then executec "/usr/local/bin/elm -s 'I am in Europe!' %r < /j/nancym/.vacation.msg"

# Messages that fall through to here get put in INBOX.novacmsg so you know that
# these folks didn't get a vacation message.
always save "~/Mail/INBOX.novacmsg"
---end excerpt of ~/.elm/filter-rules---


Hope this helps,
Nancy

Message-Id: <Cs7K97.B5t@discus.technion.ac.il>

I would like to sort the e-mail addresses in my Adressbook according to the
nickname given to this address. Pine sorts by Addressee name. I do not
see an option for changing this 'sort'. If anyone can help me, please 
write to my e-mail address below. (I'll post the answer if there seems to
be a lot of interest.) 

Thanks.

You can do this interactively while composing a letter.  When editing the
_header_ of your message (the cursor should be in the header area, not the
body), hit control-R ("rich header").  This will display the default Fcc
(file carbon copy) setting.  You can delete or change it as you wish.

How about AUIS's 'messages' support?

This MUA is the King of X-based ones at the moment [biased? - never! ;-) 
], and uses a similar format to mh of a top level directory with subdirs 
mapping to folders and files for messages.

Actually, enscript (at least the version 3 and up) is licensed to adobe.
it's not free.

I have been trying to get PC-Pine running  using Lantastic TCP/IP over 
our university's ethernet.  I followed all directions but when I bring it 
up it tells me it cannot find a packet driver.  I am using the IP version 
of PC-Pine.  

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Our computing center support staff 
has no idea.  Thanks.

Does the Lantastic TCP/IP run over packet drivers?  If so, which one are 
you running?
