I've been using Microphone II version 4.03 with my account at Netcom, and 
it's done beautifully for me. I looked thru all the new features present 
in Microphone Pro, but didn't care to shell out the extra cash to go for 
those bells and whistles.

I suggest you buy Microphone II version 5.0, you'll be quite happy with it.

   When I moved to Pine from IBM VM Rice Mail (which had a NOTEBOOK
   tag feature in the NAMES file, the equivalent of .addressbook), I
   suggested this to Pine's authors.
   They very kindly took notice of it and inserted it in the wishlist,
   I wonder if it will be implemented soon.

   B.t.w. I hope your suggestion does not imply that all mail to
   "pinco" is saved in folder "mail-to-pinco", but in a named folder,
   whose name you choose in .addressbook.
   This way one can log mail to individuals according to projects.

I finally did this yesterday and Pine 3.89 doesn't appear to work with
IMAP 3.4; I had problems with the identifier "lhostn" which appears to
have disappeared from IMAP.

Subject: Pine doesn't like . folder names
Date: 1 Jul 1994 18:52:10 GMT
Message-Id: <2v1okq$9rt@dgsi.cimage.com>

Since I use pine (3.89 on sun) on the same system that I use Sun's 
mailtool, I set up default-fcc to ".record" (used by mailtool).

I don't mind that lack of .record from the list of folders (this is
a feature as far as I am concerned, since I can jump to and read
the folder without any problem).  On the other hand, this folder name
breaks sending mail from compose. 

When I try to send the message (^X), I am told:

           Folder ".record" doesn't exist.  Create? (y/n/^C) [y]:

If I say no, pine complains that the fcc was rejected.  If I say 
yes, I complains that it couldn't create it since it already exists.

In any case, I can't send the message unless I change the fcc field.

Thanks.

Shalom!

I'm running Pine 3.89.1.2 (Hebrew support) at our site, so I've begun
using it myself (me -- an old /usr/ucb/mail diehard :)

OK -- thanks for the help about using ¬/ on my VT220 at home to get
outta that *awful* PICO and back into VI.

Now... is there any way to teach Pine to recognize the j and k keys
within menus as Next/Previous Line? and the h and l keys, too, within
folder listings?

I personally have Microphone LT, which came with my modem.  But My friend
has Microphone Pro 2.0, which he says is much better.  It is more
powerful, and easier to use.  That would be your best bet.  However, I
don't know how much it costs, but it shouldn't be over $150.  Actually, it
costs $149.95 in Mac Wharehouse.  E-mail me on your choice. I want to see
what you picked.

: : Is it at all possible to get a file from one of my discs and then put

Unless you're using a Windows terminal to read pine mail, like I do (I 
log on to my school's mainframe via Windows Terminal).  If you do this, 
then you can cut text with the mouse and paste it (use the menu in case 
the Paste keys cause your email computer system to do funky things). If I 
have text from a wordprocessor, a gopher item, or world wide web that I 
want to share with someone, I Cut it with the mouse, Paste it into 
Notepad, edit it there, Cut it all at once with the mouse and Paste it 
into pine. Try it!

  For #2:  once you have 
: the file in a directory on the same computer that's running pine for you, 
: the Ctrl-R command starts R)eading it "in" to your Pine document.  Once 
: you've typed Ctrl-R, the menu changes and Ctrl-T gives you a list of

: doesn't show up in that list, you'll need to use your host systems

: various ugly things in the file once you bring it in to Pine -- that will 
: be because the upload process hasn't dealt completely with the variations 
: in conventions about how to store text in files.  If that happens, you'll 
: need to ask more, and more specific, questions about the upload processes 
: that suit your situation.

: It sounds worse than it is.  But it did take me a while to figure out.  
: And I still get "Warning: last line of file is {something wrong}" 
: messages about half the time.  Sometimes there's a ^Z there.  Deleting it

A few minutes ago, I had the same problem for the first time.
It didn't do it for the next mail I sent out, though.  It would seem to 
be an intermittant problem.

Any clues?

This past upgrade of pico (I'm using 2.2 on Unix) is *great!*  Marking 
blocks is a large improvement.  Thanks.

I'm glad to hear that there will be a way to move to the beginning and end
of a file.  I'd also like to suggest that the next version have a way to
move back one word at a time. 

Also, it would be very helpful if one could perform a file save on a 
marked block rather than having to delete the rest of the file and change 
the file name.

It's probably been mentioned before, but tagging messages in pine would 
be very helpful for batch deletes or saves.

Back to pico, is there a way to make a supplementary dictionary for spell 
checking?  That would be a great help to me.

I'm encouraged to find this newsgroup, and impressed at the 'complaint 
department' work Dave Miller is providing.

  This was a perfect example of why I prefer the original message to come
1st.  Being at a site close to the U. of W. I almost always get David's
prompt responses before I see the original post, and in this case, as in
others, the reply didn't make sense until I'd read the question, by which
time I'd forgotten the reply, so had to go back up to it.  Somehow that
seems like *lots* more work than using ^V to skim past material I don't
need to see when the original message comes 1st.  

   I'll certainly 2nd the comments that David's replies are excellent.

   I use the following trick (works only if nickname is either surname
   or first name). If the nickname is the first name I insert the
   data in .addressbook as follows

   anna     Anna Silina c/o IFCTR               silina@ifctr.mi.cnr.it

   if it is the surname instead I use 

   abbey    Abbey - Leicester, Tony             afa@star.le.ac.uk

   Pine will take care of reversing everything after a comma, so the
   latter will appear addressed as 

   To: Tony Abbey - Leicester <afa@star.le.ac.uk>

I got this stuff working, but only when I access a folder using
the imap daemon; i.e. I have to add {localhost} before the mailbox name.
So I have to login via IMAP again, but at least it works!

It did compile, but I still couldn't see the mh folders.  Of course, I
could have had something else still wrong.

What do you have set for "news-collections" in your .pinerc file?  Is 
your newsfeed on the local system or a remote NNTP server?

Actually, an NFS mounted /usr/mail is a sure source of problems.  We 
strongly recommend using IMAP for remote folder access and especially for 
remote INBOX access.  The usual source of lock related hangs is a stuck 
rpc.lockd on the server...

the other thing you have to do is to '#' out of the 'illegal first character'
set in os.c (line 392 and thereabouts), so #mh/folder would be considered
a valid folder name. I still can't get it to work, but that's probably my
lack of knowledge in addressing folders in pine.

 Hello, 

 I would like to express few off my thoughts about what I need from
pine to be able to do in the field of cryptography.

 I was thinking about using pine with PGP. I even got a patch which
add to pico editor ability to crypt a message with recipients public
key or sign it with your key. But there is no possibility to decrypt a
message or check signature. What makes a usage of PGP impossible with
pine.

 Wouldn't it be nice to add some extended field to mail header.
Something like Content-Type: text/crypted, text/signature ...??? Such
header would cause pine to start a command defined in .pinerc or in
.mailcap This command would be started with some enviromental varialbe
like SENDING (RECEIVING), TMP_MAIL_FILE, FROM_USER, FROM_HOST,
TO_USER, TO_HOST read from the header. This command would get and
return a mail body through TMP_MAIL_FILE. In general it would be a
good way when receiving and sending mail. When sending pine could have
one extra field in Rich Hdr, Crypt: With value y or n And with default
set in .pinerc.

 There would be also nice to be able to store your mail crypted in the
folders on the disk. But it is reasonable (for example in PGP) to
store them crypted in different way than how they where during
sending/receiving (for example not in public-key but DES way).

 I wonder does anybody except me is interested to have thing like this
in pine :-) ? And does this what I wrote makes sense at all ?

 Regards
 Wojtek Bogusz

I am using filter to route incoming email in pine and everything works 
great - but the command filter -c (used at the % prompt) seems to get 
lost in cyberspace... I have waited upto 5 minutes and it does not seem 
to work.  Any ideas what i'm doing wrong?  -c option is used to clear the 
filterlog file.

also i found out that in the filter-rules you can sort based on the FROM 
line in an email header and not just the TO and CC lines :)

thanks in advance - andy

	Since "filter" is from the elm distribution don't you think that
the elm group would have been a more appropriate place to ask this question?

	Be that as it may....have you tried:

filter -c -s    or 
filter -c -S

It will ok if you only send ONE paragraph through PINE.  

If you have compose your letter offline, and consist of several 
paragraph, with columnar text and numbers, you will find all these jumble 
up into one paragraph.

The only way out for me is is load in joe and upload the ascii file as 
text, save it as file (or as the origibal posted suggest upload as file 
and read in.)

It is nothing to do with how my program is configured if I can upload OK 
into Joe, I should upload OK into PINE, so the question is then how is 
PINE/PICO configuration differ from JOE?

Nathaniel Borenstein recently submitted a draft proposal for PGP support in
MIME.  It is very possible that Pine will support this proposal at some
point, assuming it develops in a reasonable fashion.  It is available as
draft-borenstein-pgp-mime-00.txt or draft-borenstein-pgp-mime-00.ps from your
nearest RFC repository (e.g. ftp.isi.edu).

I know there has been some discussion on this in the past, but I can't 
remember what the answers were; How do you have Pine default to using an arrow 
cursor to point to your selection on the menus instead of the inverse 
highlight.

Is there any limit to the number of names in the bcc line?  If I
am distributing a mailer to, say, 150 people, will it balk at me?

There is no theoretical limit to the number of addresses in any of the
headers.  There have been occasional interaction problems with sendmail for
very long lists though...

I've sucsessfully compiled VMS Pine and Pico on our VAX and am anxious to
try them out, but I've hit one snag. For some reason, our machine doesn't
support SMTP. I get "Error connecting to mail server" when I try to send.

My domain-server vaiable is set to "cnsvax.uwec.edu"
I cannoy seem to set the PINE_MAIL_PROTOCOL variable for the life of me.

Has anyone else run into this problem?

Thanks.

 cnm is the extension that charon (whatever the mail server is) names the 
 files when saving them.

In other words is there a pine to do the equivalent of pegasus...at least 
in reading mail?  I like pine much better than pegasus for dos.

I just installed Linux and Pine was working one day, then the next its 
not. When I type Pine, nothing happens and I have to hit Ctl-C to get 
back to the Linux command line.

Can anyone help me in finding out what is happening?

BTW the Pine executable is present.

Thanks in advance.

I am trying to install Pine 3.89 on two different systems, an HP-UX 9 machine
and a Solaris 2 machine.  Both work ok but I have nothing but grief with
the Ctrl-C to cancel a message thing.

On HP-UX ctrl-C always bails right out of pine and on Solaris 2 it seems to
work but 90% of the time I don't get the proper:

Cancelling will abandon your mail message.  Cancel? [n] :

prompt above the command list  (I can get it sometimes but it's easy and I'm
never quite sure how I manage to get it) Usually nothing shows up and then if
I hit n for No the No shows up wherever the cursor was.  (This is using pico
as the editor of course).

It seems to me that on HP-UX pico/pine isn't handling the tty right and it is
letting ctrl-c just kill it.  I don't know what is happening on Solaris 2.

Anyone else have these problems?  It's quite bad because we were hoping to
install pine as some user's shell (obviously this is something people have
done/considered because a user can change their password from within pine)
and hitting ctrl-c on HPUX when pine is your shell logs you right out.

I've found the easiest way to figure this out if you use tin is to save 
the article then use pico to look at it.  You'll see the path that the  
article took.  The FIRST computer listed is your news server.  If its 
the machine you login on to (like my secondary account) setup as per 
the local instructions.  If not (like this account) set it up as per 
the remote instructions.  Hope that helps you or someone.  :)

I'm not sure how netcom is configured either.  I know there are plenty of
proficient Pine users there though, just ask around...

Just to cast a different light on this topic, we ran an email service
with pine 3.07 (and several other unix mailers) using two HP 735s, one
an NFS server that exported /usr/mail and the other a client that
mounted /usr/mail (on /usr/mail, naturally :) We had no problems like
those Noel has described during the 9 month production run of the
service. 

The key is indeed to make sure that rpc.lockd and rpc.statd (as well as
rpc.mountd and portmap) are behaving as they should. You should double
check /etc/netnfsrc against /etc/inetd.conf to make sure they agree on
what services are being started by whom. We also modified pine slightly
so that pine's lock files were created in a directory called
/usr/mail/.locks - this prevented the problem of pine creating locks in
the /tmp directory of both machines and thus made life a little easier
for both users and sysadmins like myself ;)

You mean SMTP-SERVER, right? Try TELNET/PORT=25 CNSVAX.UWEC.EDU and see whether
it works ok or you get some error message there.

To what value do you try to set it?

Please answer directly to me and we'll continue it off-line.

Pine is very good about status messages telling users what it's up to. 
One place where a message would be useful is when calling up an external 
editor. On slow systems it can take 10-20 seconds between hitting the key 
sequence and anything (apparently) happening. Just a "Invoking 
alternative editor - please wait" would do.

I can second this.  I tried to NFS mount /usr/mail and sendmail gagged.
Definitely lock file problems.

	I can suggest a clumsy way to tackle your problem.  You could 
delete your default sent-mail folder everytime you start PINE, like 
`alias pine "rm -f ~/mail/sent-mail;pine"'.  Anybody know a better way 
round this?

HI...

After reading amazing thing about MIME and knowing that pine is one
of mail user agent that support MIME extension, I wonder if it support
the whole set of MIME..  

I've try to make up header intend to have Pine do anon-ftp for me but 
so far it fails me (or I fail pine?).  It is probably my lack of correct 
understanding of MIME syntax that fail my experimental.  Anyhow I want
to make sure that pine is capable of what I've tried to prove it have.
Oh FYI, the current version of pine is 3.87.


Thanks in advance.

Is there a way in Unix Pine to mark a message as not read, after you've 
actually read it?  I usually read mail with Pine in a vt100 window, but 
occasionally I'd like to receive certain messages via Eudora.  Once I 
read the message with Pine, however, Eudora won't recogize it as new mail 
and retrieve it.

Thanks for any advice...

Hi,

i am a new user to pine - I now know how to filter incoming mail into different
folders, but is this possible with outgoing mail too, so that when I send 
mail to a specific person (or group), it is also copied into a predefined
folder automatically?

Thanks for the information.  You might want to change the wording in the 
documentation (pine technical notes), which implies that Pine works 
fairly well over NFS mounts is no other mail readers are in use.

I think imap would be a better way for me to do this-- but I have not 
been able to figure out exactly how to set up rimap to eliminate the need 
for entering passwords.

Assuming my hosts and hosts.equiv'ed, and I have a link between imapd and
/etc/rimapd, what else do I need to do?  I pointed inetd.conf at the link,
but it still asked for passwords.

Thanks again for your help.

Noel

The correct way to do this is to, in your .pinerc, specify "" as the 
folder to save to.

Another way is to specify /dev/null as the folder to receive sent-mail.

The original suggestion would work a little nicer if you remove the 
folder after you run pine.  That way it will be deleted as very soon 
after created, and will never be seen.

Hello,
	I have a pine question.  What other type of question would I mail 
to this list?

	When our primary name server goes down it takes pine such a long 
time to execute.  Why is this, and is there a way to correct it?  We have 
ping using an smtp server, but even though the server name is in our 
/etc/hosts file and if we usent e ip address it still takes pine much to 
long to load if our name server is down.

If you manually invoke rimapd (e.g. "rsh servername /etc/rimapd") the 
problem is often readily apparent...

Using rimap, inetd is completely out of the picture, so the inetd.conf 
setting does not matter in that case.

Pine supports MIME at something better than the "minimal conformance"  level,
but not everything in the protocol is fully supported.  If you are going to
be generating your own MIME, I would suggest studying appendices A and B of
RFC1521....

It looks like pine at startup tries to get the hostname of the machine
that it is executing on (i.e., calls gethostname() on a SunOS machine,
calls systeminfo(SI_HOSTNAME) on a Solaris 2.3 machine).  If your
local system is configured to look at the DNS instead of /etc/hosts
for the hostname info and you have multiple nameservers specified in
your /etc/resolv.conf, then if the first nameserver listed doesn't
respond, the resolver routines will wait a while before trying the
next nameserver listed.  So what you're probably seeing at startup is
the lag time before the resolver routines give up on the first
nameserver and move on to the next one.

You could avoid that by having your resolver routines look in
/etc/hosts before consulting the DNS (though that's a debatable
strategy in general).

I am looking for someone who has compiled Pine on an Intergraph
system running sVr3, or another sVr3 system.

Please respond to marineg@hsvaic.hv.boeing.com

Thanks,
Gary Marine

I know that typing ^R gives you Pine's "rich" header.  Is there a way to 
get Pine to always display the rich header by default?

Subject: Scrolling, not redrawing, in pico
Date: 6 Jul 1994 02:56:54 GMT
Message-Id: <2vd6hm$ofv@cantua.canterbury.ac.nz>


We recently upgraded to Pine 3.89 and Pico 2.3, on Sun (Solaris). 

I now have problems on a slow modem line, because I can't figure out how
to persuade pico to scroll the screen, rather than redrawing all the
characters. This is VERY slow and tedious at 2400 baud.

With the old version, I could do an: 
  stty 2400 
and pico would realize that the line was slow, and scroll. That no
longer appears to work.  

Any suggestions? 

Mike

I believe you can always find pine under ftp.cac.washington.edu:/mail. 
This is the primary distribution site of pine.

Is there any way to add a " Reply to: " field to Pine when composing

Those of us who work behind firewalls could find this extremely useful!

I sometimes forward the message to myself which does the trick, but
for only pruning a line or two the extra header it adds on is not worth it,
so I only do it for much longer messages I want to keep pieces of.

be available in a few weeks.

Subject: Enhancement suggestion: multiple addressbooks
Message-Id: <dudek.773513559@spot.Colorado.EDU>
Date: Wed, 6 Jul 1994 16:52:39 GMT

We have recently moved about 2000 users from VMS to Unix, and they are
using pine.  They would like to be able to maintain a personal addressbook
as well as a group address book for a group of users.  It would be great
if there was some way to specify 2 files for the addressbook in the .pinerc.
We don't care too much about editing these files (i.e. what happens when
you type A to get to the addressbook?) but it would be best if A would allow
the user to edit their personal addressbook (.addressbook) and then the
person keeping the group file could just edit it outside of pine. 

Is this a possibility?

The subject line says it all.  My system only has emacs, and I am sick of
that.  I'd like to get pico and see if I can install it.  If anybody can
tell me where I can find it, please let me know.  Thank you.

The ipop3d server that somes with the imap stuff availalable on the ftp 
archive ftp.cac.washington.edu allows pop clients to access imap services,
I believe.  If I'm right, you could do something like set your pop
server to point to the ipop3d server, and then use the proper imap inbox 
name for the address portion.  The man page says:

      IPOP2d and IPOP3d are servers which support the POP2 and POP3 remote
      mail access protocols respectively.  IPOP2d and IPOP3d can also be
      used by POP2 and POP3 clients to access mailboxes on IMAP servers by
      specifying a login user name in the form <host>:<user> e.g.,
      SERVER.WASHINGTON.EDU:SMITH.

However, I think that pico is included with pine.  Look for DLM's posts 
and send email to his address asking him if you can get it separately.

Pine and Pico are available from ftp.cac.washington.edu. Pico sources are
included in the Pine source distribution (mail/pine.tar.Z) or there are a few
pre-compiled executables in the mail/unix-bin directory.

Noel,
I'm guessing that Caitrin was interested in making *saved message* folders
accessible to PC-Eudora, rather than simply sharing a common INBOX.

As far as I know, PC-Eudora uses the Bky Unix "mbox" format, which is also
what Pine uses by default.  So it *should* be possible to transfer Unix
Pine folders to your PC and access them as local folders in Eudora... but
I haven't tried this myself.  I'm guessing you want to transfer in "ascii"
mode in order to get newline conversion. 

POP3 does not support access to arbitrary remote folders, only the inbox,
so using the ipop3d as a "POP-to-IMAP gateway" will probably not help
in this case.

For those who are interested in co-existence of IMAP and POP clients
with respect to INBOX access:

1. You can run a POP server on the same machine acting as your IMAP 
server.  The ipop3d Noel mentions would be a good choice, since it uses 
the same locking discipline as imapd.  (I believe the CMU IMAP server 
also has a companion POP server available.)

2. If both POP and IMAP servers exist, but are on different machines, you
could replace the existing POP server with ipop3d, which is capable of
operating as a gateway to a different IMAP server for POP clients, as well
as providing normal POP access to INBOXes stored on the same machine. 

3. If you can't touch the existing servers, but have root access to yet
another Unix box, you could run ipop3d on it, and have it serve purely
as a POP gateway to an existing IMAP server.

Note that the gateway works best if you don't leave mail on the server. If
you tell Eudora to leave mail on the server, it will keep fetching the
same messages over and over when you check for new mail.  This is probably
fixable, but we haven't had time to track down the incompatibilty.

I was reading through/deleting a backlog of mail since I have been on
holiday for a while. So I had finally reached yesterdays mail when
pine beeped "New mail! from blah hlah...." So I wento back into the
index from the view message screen and surprsingly the message seemed
like it had arrived on June 5 instead of June 6 when it actually came
in. The header follows..

The guys sent it to me a little past 8pm on June 6, no doubt about

This isnt a big deal but just an FYI, just in case the developers
would liek to know.

I am pretty sure that the compiler warnings and the log messages are in no
way related.  It looks like you have some messages in your INBOX that have a
date field that Pine does not understand.  If you send a copy of the messages
in question to pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu we will try to determine why they
are not being recognized.

According to the message headers, the message was written at a little 
past 8 AM, July 5, but did not leave America Online until almost 9 PM on 
July 6 (almost 37 hour delay!)

Pine correctly displayed the date from the Date: header in the message...

I prefer that this type of request be directed to comp.mail.pine or 
pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu.  I recieve _alot_ of mail andit is much 
easier for me if all of the Pine-related mail comes in on the pine 
lists...

I think this does show, though, that perhaps pico should be packaged and 
available seperately as well as with pine.  I know a couple of years ago 
I wanted to install pico and I didn't know it came with pine, and I spend 
many hour searching archie logs looking for it before someone told me I 
was looking in the wrong place.

I have a huge mailing list (50+) that creates an enormous header

How do I remove the attchmnt line from the header?  I've looked at the

Pine 3.89 does not have a way to hide the Attchmnt: line.

Subject: Problems with pine and xbiff : detecting incoming mail
Message-Id: <1994Jul4.123241.741@inca.comlab.ox.ac.uk>
Date: Mon, 4 Jul 94 12:32:41 BST

Hi everybody,

I am a new pine user and I am quite happy with it. However I have a little
problem : pine does not signal new incoming mail, it doesn't flash the screen,
doen't beep, doesn't do anything... Is there a way around this ? 

When using pine from my workstation (Sparc under solaris 2.3), I thought of 
using xbiff simultaneously (xbiff just opens a little window with an icon that 
signals when new mail arrives); xbiff worked fine, but then I noticed that pine 
didn't manage to detect the new mail when I tried to open the folder INBOX. 
To read it I have to exit pine and enter it again. So the combination pine+xbiff 
is not really good...

Has anyone a solution for this problem ?

Thanks in advance

Adriano Barenco

Hi to everybody,

I am  a new pine user and find it quite convenient, however I have a little
problem: when I get new mail, pine does not signal it to me in any way (beep
flash or any other things). So I tried to run xbiff in parallel (xbiff gives
you a little postbox icon in your workspace that has a flag up when you have
mail), xbiff works fine, but then when I wnat to open the INBOX folder, I can't
find the new mail. To read it I have to quit and enter pine again. Is there a
way around this ? Either get something else than xbiff, or have pine signal new
incoming mail...

Any help appreciated,

Adriano Barenco

Worked fine for me on my Solaris 2.3 workstation -- pine should indeed
inform you of new mail, but it only checks every couple of minutes.
You can force it to check _now_ by typing Control-L.  So when I
noticed xbiff's flag going up, I would type Control-L in the xterm I
was running pine in to force pine to look for the new mail.

(Then I got tired of xbiff and decided I really could wait a couple of
minutes to find out I had new mail.)

Yes.  Press ^R to enable rich headers while in the header section and 
then use your list alias in the Bcc: line.

	That would seem to be the function of your terminal emulation
software....not pine.

The PC version of Pine 3.90 will be able to set colors.

Hello!  I am getting segmentation faults if I have something like the

inbox-path={$IMAPSERVER}inbox

On my personal account, I am defining IMAPSERVER as follows:

IMAPSERVER=ecstest.asu.edu
export IMAPSERVER

If I get rid of pine.conf and specify the path to the inbox (as above) in 
my .pinerc, I have no trouble.

I can't take any more core dumps.  Please advise.

Thanks.

Hi to everybody,
 
    I'm a new pine user, and I'm quite happy with it. However,
    when I'm working on my station (SParc under solaris 2.3), I
    would like pine to signal any new incoming mail. I haven't
    found a way to have it do it, so I tried to use xbiff in
    parallel (xbiff is just a little program that opens a window
    on the desktop with an icon that signal when new mail's in).
    The problem is that, when running xbiff, I cannot access with
    pine the new mail, i.e. when I try to open the folder INBOX,
    pine does not find any new message. Does someone have a
    suggestion how to do that ?
 
    Thanks for your help

Is it possible to save the material that you cut from a file to a file
name, so that you can read it into another file?  If so, please explain.

I was just getting started on using Pine.  I notice that the
default editor is pico, but that there is an option for an
alternate editor.  However, is there any way to make the
default editor be 'emacs'?  Any info is appreciated.

Yes, we built it successfully on 5.4.2.1 and 5.4.3.0 MU01. That is the 
3.89 version.  If you can send me the error output, I can maybe help.  It 
has been a while since I made the patches.

please help.

No, pico is very tightly coupled with Pine, especially for constructing the
headers, so a complete replacement is not practical.  Pine 3.90 will have an
option to automatically invoke your alternate editor for the body of the
message though. 

I suppose you could write a libpico.a replacement that invoked emacs...... ;)

My problem was that I had generated the Solaris pine.conf by making a copy 
of the SunOS 4.1 pine.conf, which, in turn, was generated by making a 
copy of a .pinerc.

David, thanks much for your reply. = )

Subject: procmail - mail processing package v3.03 has been released
Date: 8 Jul 1994 18:40:18 GMT
Message-Id: <2vk6ii$8jc@urmel.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Mime-Version: 1.0

[ It is currently available from comp.sources.misc, volume 43.
  There have been a considerable amount of changes since v2.91, for details
  look in the HISTORY file inside the package. ]

The procmail mail processing program. (v3.03 1994/06/30)

Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming mail
into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to one or more
mailing lists or for prioritising your mail), preprocess your mail, start
any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate different chimes on your
workstation for different types of mail) or selectively forward certain
incoming mail automatically to someone.

Procmail can be used:
	- and installed by an unprivileged user (for himself only).
	- as a drop in replacement for the local delivery agent /bin/mail
	  (with biff/comsat support).
	- as a general mailfilter for whole groups of messages (e.g. when
	  called from within sendmail.cf rules).

The accompanying formail program enables you to generate autoreplies, split up
digests/mailboxes into the original messages, do some very simple
header-munging/extraction, or force mail into mail-format (with leading From
line).

 ----------------------
A recent version can be picked up at various comp.sources.misc archives.
The latest version can be obtained directly from the ftp-archive at:

	ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (137.226.225.3)

as (g)zipped tar file:	   /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz	<160KB
as compressed tar file:	   /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.Z	<224KB
 ----------------------

Feature summary for procmail:
	+ It's less filling (i.e. small)
	+ Very easy to install (rated PG6 :-)
	+ Simple to maintain and configure because
	  all you need is actually only ONE executable (procmail)
	  and ONE configuration file (.procmailrc)
	+ Is event driven (i.e. gets invoked automagically when mail arrives)
	+ Does not use *any* temporary files
	+ Uses standard egrep regular expressions
	+ It poses a very low impact on your system's resources
	  (it's 1.4 times faster than the average /bin/mail in user-cpu
	   time)
	+ Allows for very-easy-to-use yes-no decisions on where the mail
	  should go (can take the size of the mail into consideration)
	+ Also allows for neural-net-type weighted scoring of mails
	+ Filters, delivers and forwards mail *reliably*
	+ Provides a reliable hook (you might even say anchor :-) for any
	  programs or shell scripts you may wish to start upon mail arrival
	+ Performs heroically under even the worst conditions
	  (file system full, out of swap space, process table full,
	  file table full, missing support files, unavailable executables,
	  denied permissions) and tries to deliver the mail somehow anyway
	+ Absolutely undeliverable mail (after trying every trick in the book)
	  will bounce back to the sender (or not, your choice)
	+ Is one of the few mailers to perform reliable mailbox locking across
	  NFS as well (DON'T use NFS mounted mailboxes WITHOUT installing
	  procmail; you may lose valuable mail one day)
	+ Supports four mailfolder standards: single file folders (standard
	  and nonstandard VNIX format), directory folders that contain one file
	  per message, or the similar MH directory folders (numbered files)
	+ Variable assignment and substitution is an extremely complete subset
	  of the standard /bin/sh syntax
	+ Provides a mail log file, which logs all mail arrival, shows
	  in summary whence it came, what it was about, where it went (what
	  folder) and how long (in bytes) it was
	+ Uses this log file to display a wide range of diagnostic and error
	  messages (if something went wrong)
	+ Does not impose *any* limits on line lengths, mail length (as long
	  as memory permits), or the use of any character (any 8-bit character,
	  including '\0' is allowed) in the mail
	+ It has man pages (boy, does *it* have man pages)
	+ Procmail can be used as a local delivery agent with comsat/biff
	  support (*fully* downwards compatible with /bin/mail); in which case
	  it can heal your system mailbox, if something messes up the
	  permissions
	+ Secure system mailbox handling (contrary to several well known
	  /bin/mail implementations)
	+ Provides for a controlled execution of programs and scripts from
	  the aliases file (i.e. under defined user ids)
	+ Allows you to painlessly shift the system mailboxes into the
	  user's home directories
	+ It runs on virtually all (old and future) operating systems which
	  names start with a 'U' or end in an 'X' :-) (i.e. extremely portable
	  code; POSIX, ANSI C and K&R conforming)
	+ Is clock skew immune (e.g. in the case of NFS mounted mailboxes)
	+ Can be used as a general mailfilter for whole groups of messages
	  (e.g. when called from within sendmail.cf rules).
	+ Works with (among others?) sendmail, smail, MMDF and mailsurr

Feature summary for formail:
	+ Can generate auto-reply headers
	+ Can convert mail into standard mailbox format (so that you can
	  process it with standard mail programs)
	+ Can split up mailboxes into the individual messages
	+ Can split up digests into the individual messages
	+ Can split up saved articles into the individual articles
	+ Can do simple header munging/extraction
	+ Can extract messages from mailboxes
	+ Can recognise duplicate messages

Feature summary for lockfile:
	+ Provides NFS-secure lockfiles to shell script programmers
	+ Gives normal users the ability to lock their system mailbox,
	  regardless of the permissions on the mail-spool directory

Subject: SmartList - mailinglist package v3.03 has been released
Date: 8 Jul 1994 18:42:22 GMT
Message-Id: <2vk6me$8jt@urmel.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

[ It is currently available from comp.sources.misc volume43. ]

The SmartList mailinglist management package. (v3.03 1994/06/30)

The SmartList mailinglist package has been built on top of the procmail
mail processing package.  In order to install it you'll need the source
of the procmail package as well.

If you now have just the SmartList sources, get the procmail sources and
unpack them on top of the SmartList source tree.
----------------------
A recent version of both packages can be picked up at various
comp.sources.misc archives.
The latest versions can be obtained directly from the ftp-archive at:

        ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de

as (g)zipped tar files:    /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz
                           /pub/packages/procmail/SmartList.tar.gz
as compressed tar files:   /pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.Z
                           /pub/packages/procmail/SmartList.tar.Z
----------------------
Summary of what SmartList provides:
	+ The overseeable management of an arbitrary number of mailinglists
	+ Convenient and simple creation of new mailinglists
	+ Convenient and simple removal of existing mailinglists
	+ Fully automated subscription/unsubscription/help-request processing
	  (no operator intervention needed)
	+ Enough intelligence to overcome the ignorance of some subscribers
	  (will direct subscribe and unsubscribe requests away from the
	  regular list and automatically onto the -request address)
	+ No hardwired format for (un)subscribe requests (i.e. new subscribers
	  need not be educated, unsubscribing users do not need to remember
	  any particular syntax)
	+ *Intelligent* autoremoval of addresses from the list that cause
	  too many bounces
	+ Submissions can be limited to people on the accept list (which could
	  be the current list of subscribers)
	+ The fully automated subscription mechanism allows for a reject list
	  of unwanted subscribers and a general address screening mechanism
	  which allows you to control exactly who is allowed to subscribe
	+ Optional implicit subscription upon first submission to the list
	+ MIME-compliant auto-digest-generation (configurable per list)
	+ Joint management of several mailinglists possible
	+ Customisation per mailinglist or mailinglist group possible (simply
	  remove or create the desired hardlinks)
	+ A listmaintainer can be assigned per list;  miscellaneous requests
	  that couldn't be handled by the list automatically are then
	  forwarded to his mail address (instead of being accumulated in
	  a file)
	+ Allows for remote maintenance of any mailinglist by a
	  listmaintainer
	+ Integrated archiving service
	+ Integrated diagnostic aid to give hints to the maintainer about
	  possible problems
	+ Moderated mailinglists with an arbitrary number of moderators
	+ Automatically eliminates duplicate submissions
	+ You can set up a mailinglist to function as a standalone mail
	  archive server
	+ Extended MIME support (autorecognition of well known file formats)
	+ The archive server can send arbitrarily long (even binary) files
	  in MIME-multipart mails

Subject: Installing Pine
Date: 8 Jul 1994 21:05:38 GMT
Message-Id: <2vkf32$1g2@usenet.srv.cis.pitt.edu>

Do I need to have root access to successfully install Pine?  I was able to
compile it rather easily, but am having trouble getting it to work.  The
tech-notes reccommend placing the executables in either /usr/local/bin or
/usr/bin  On my system, those directories are write protected, and I am not
able to install them there.  When I put them (the executables) in my home
directory, I am able to start up Pine, etc. and even send mail messages.
However, when I try to test receiving mail, the received messages all go
to the current mail program.  Do I need to create a bin directory in my
home directory and link it?  If so, how do I go about doing so.  Any help 
would be appreciated.

I am also having a few problems when I do run it. For example, whenever I
try to compose a message, after I type in the address, I normally hit
enter to move to the next field which is CC.  However, when I hit enter
it asks me which file I want to attach.  The only way for me to move to the
next field is using the arrow keys.  Also, as I'm typing the message using 
Pico...Every time I hit enter, it concatanates the current line to the line
above it.  I use Pine on another system and have never had these problems, 
so I assume I am installing wrong or something.  Any ideas?

Thank you.

(I think it has usually been postponed messages), as soon as I receive
mail.  Is there anyway to prevent this from happening or at least retrieve
my lost composition?

I have pine running with imapd, but would like to use the rimpad feature.
I understand how to link from /etc/rimapd to imapd, but I do not
understand how to use it.  I have read the tech notes over and over, and
it seems like I am missing something-- a basic understanding of how to use
rsh to access tcp sockets.  Can someone post or direct me to cookbook
instructions for getting it to work?

I have a problem that I hope someone knows the solution to.  We are
running Pine on a PC running BSD/386.  Everything works great except
when people connect to the machine using NCSA Telnet on the Mac.
For these people, the return key ends up being treated like it
is sending linefeeds during mail creation, such that hitting return
either tries to attach files or in the body tries to reform the
paragraph.

Any suggestions?

We run a system that has both Macs and PC's connected by CAP and PC-NFS 
respectively to a Sun/Auspex NFS environment. 

PC users mount their Unix home directories via PC-NFS and use Pine on Unix
for email. Mac users mount their Unix home directories via CAP and use
Eudora on Mac for email. 

Mac -> PC document transfer seems much easier than PC -> Mac, mainly due to 
the way in which Mac resource forks are handled. Excel on Mac refuses to 
open PC Excel spreadsheets MIME mailed Pine->Eudora or saved via PC-NFS 
and read via CAP. Resediting the file to fix Type/Creator does not seem 
to fool Excel.

Does anyone with a similar environment have a tried and tested regime for 
passing documents from PC <-> Mac via shared directories and/or MIME ?

    Yes.  <E>xport the file.  It will be written into your home directory
rather than your mail directory.  Any special encodings will be converted
to displayable characters.  And you will get only these headers.  You can
also export multiple messages to the same file, appending each to the
previous exported message.

The ANSI-like codes displayed during and after an ASCII upload from
Procomm go away if I press control-L (redraw screen).  It isn't necessary
to press control-J (justify), so you don't need to worry about messing up
formatting.

Is it possible to set the line length in Pine?  I think 80-character lines
are too long to read comfortably, and they often lead to ugly wrapping if
quoted. 

(Of course, I have the same problem with Tin, which also uses Pico.)

We had to rewrite the code to move functions away from control-J.
Some sites do not have this problem, including the home of pine in
Washington, but some do.  I would sincerely request a "no control j"
compile option in some forthcoming version.  I'll try to package the
changes as a patch for 3.90; right now the various changes we did are
intermingled, so I don't have this part readily available.

You may note that literally control key and J ends up as a control-M
character on the unix host.  This is the problem.  We could not find
what does it. The version of telnet is the same one they have at
Washington.  Probably it is somewhere in the network.

Somehow I am sending messages like the above using Pine.  It happens when
I read in a file [^R] which I have uploaded from my DOS PC to the Unix
workstation where I have my Internet account.  After that at the end of
every line there is ^M (which acts like _one_ character if I try to delete
it.  If I e-mail it others see it as above and forward it to me to show 
me. 

Could it be that the ^M toggles MIME?  (I don't even know what MIME is :) 
.)  The work-around I'm using to use uploaded files is to send them first 
to myself after including them. They come though fine, then I forward the 
message to the real recipient (first removing the header).

Thanks for any help.

Don

You mat be able to termorarily work around the problem with an stty
command to change the way ctrl-j and ctrl-m work.  Here are some
possibilities to try (with explanations from the stty man page):

stty options

options that might affect it:

      igncr (-igncr)           Ignore (do not ignore) CR on input.
      icrnl (-icrnl)           Map (do not map) CR to a new-line character
                               on input.
      onlcr (-onlcr)           Map (do not map) new-line character to a
                               carriage-return/new-line character sequence
                               on output.
      ocrnl (-ocrnl)           Map (do not map) CR to new-line character on
                               output.
      onlret (-onlret)         On the terminal, a new-line character
                               performs (does not perform) the CR function.

typing stty -a should show the current setup.

Good luck!

Such a feature would be great.  What would be even greater would be to
be able to access such a list, from within pine, remotely at other

I think this questions has been asked before, and perhaps answered, but 
what unix editor can I invoke on my host machine or download to it that 
will more closely resemble WordStar?

It has always been true that I have a tendency to use WordStar commands 
while writing email online, but now that the host has switched from 
clunky Eve to slicker Pico/Pine, I find that I now have a tendency to use 
Pine commands while in WordStar!

Plus I can't stand those long reaches to ctrl-@. Ctrl f, b, d, and h 
don't post any problem, but ctrl-c is bad (it's page down in WordStar) as 
is cntrl-x (I don't remember what that does in WordStar, but my fingers 
do, and that is the whole problem--a touch typist doesn't know what the 
fingers are doing; they just go ahead and do it!).

Some versions of Pine (e.g. 3.87) will trigger BASE64 encoding on a ^M.  Pine
3.89 is much less sensitive in that regard....

Look for an editer called 'joe'.  It is a very small, but full-featured 
editor that uses wordstar bindings.

I saw this problem too. I was able to get rid of it by finagling with

I just transferred my Eudora (Mac) folders to my unix account, and put 
them in ~/mail.  I used ftp where the ftp-client did the proper linefeed
conversion.  Pine read the files with no problems.  I suppose you can
make it happen the other way around too.

     Mac Pine is still vapor.  I hope that I may be able to return to working
on it later this year.  I'm currently involved with other tasks.

     As a temporary expedient, I recommend Mail Drop from Baylor as a very
nice (if somewhat minimal) IMAP client for the Mac.  To date, it's the only
Mac program I've tested which is reliable (I've never had it crash) and uses
IMAP in the remote access model.

     The problem is not in NCSA Telnet, but rather in the telnetd on the UNIX
host.  A version of BSD telnetd of several years ago did not handle Telnet
newlines correctly.  This was fixed back in 1991, but a lot of vendors still
are distributing the old broken version.

     A workaround for some systems (e.g. NeXT) is the command: stty -extproc

     Your problem with returns being transmogrified to line feeds is a known
bug in old versions of the BSD Telnet daemon.  The choice is to upgrade to a
newer version of telnetd, or try the command
	stty -extproc
as a possible workaround.

Shift K to delete a message, but how do I save a message to stay in that 
message after reading it?  After I read a message it delete's it when I 
exit that newsgroup..  Any ideas?

Subject: pine3.89 on SCO ODT 3.0 -- without mmdf
Date: 11 Jul 1994 01:33:44 GMT
Message-Id: <2vq7ho$hkj@camco.celestial.com>

I compiled pine3.89 this afternoon for SCO 3.0 without mmdf to use
with smail-3.1.28 and sendmail.  I used the imap-3.2 c-client that
we've been using here for several months (copied the ANSI/c-client
directory directly into the pine hierarchy).  For pine itself, I
started with the HP (hpp) files as I had done with pine-3.07, and
there were very few modifications necessary to get this working.

The main things I had to do was to change the load libraries in the
makefile and a couple of minor defines in the osdep/os-sco.h file
(vfork isn't available, and it needs sys/time.h).  I also added a
truncate() command to the os-sco.h.

This seems to be working, but I haven't thoroughly tested all the
options.  It appears to work properly both with mailboxes on remote
systems, and with local mailboxes.  It did not work on a local file in
mmdf format (but then I wasn't trying to make this work :-).

The compiled source is in:
    ftp.celestial.com:/pub/sco-ports/unix/pine-3.89.tar.gz

I would be interested in any feedback from anybody who tries this or
other people who've got pine working on SCO without mmdf.

It's been a while since I last looked at pine (version 3.07 to be
specific).  At that time, I also started with the HP files, and had to
change a call to disk_space because of different block size reporting.
I didn't find any references to this in the pine-3.89 distribution so
this change wasn't made here.

I would recommend Mailstrom. The only problem that I have had is having
PPP dial the modem when I start it up. This locks the computer up. I
have to to go into the PPP control panel to make the connection first.
Otherwise, I have had no crashes. (Of course, I've only used it
minimally from home, too, so take it for what it's worth.) I've heard that
version 2.0 is supposed to be right around the corner so enclosures will be
possible.

Having MacPine would be really nice though. I really dislike not having
access to my remote folders unless I telnet to one of my machines and use
Pine.

The Pine on my system, by default, does *not* save outgoing mail into any

Is there a way (other than using postpone (^O) and quitting),
to interrupt Pine, drop to the operating system (spawn), do
something there, and then exit back to Pine?

We have a concerned director of our network, who would like to know what 
using ^S while in compose does to cause the session to freeze (and I can 
verify that it does on everything from Mac to Sun to PC.)

And is there a way to trap the ^S signal so as to protect the unsuspecting?

Grateful as always,

I don't know of any way to trap the ^S, but you can probably set ixany
for the terminal session which will treat any character from the
terminal as an xon to restart transmission.  You may want to do this
by putting it in the /etc/gettydefs for the terminal, or it could
probably be put in a shell wrapper for pine.  i.e.

:
#! /bin/sh
STTY=`stty -g`  # save current settings
pine            # execcute pine
stty $STTY      # restore settings to previous values.

Tried this, no joy, same freezing occurred.  Perhaps it is a local problem 
with our Sun.

Pine will automatically try to open an rsh connection before trying the IMAP
port (143).  If "rsh host /etc/rimapd" works, Pine should work.  If not, the
errors from rsh should give you a place to start looking.

When I upload my ACSII file to mail to a friend, it shows up in PINE as 
all run together, that is, my carriage returns don't make it.  
	I'm wondering what I'm not doing right.
	If I attach the file, rather than just uploading it to be sent as 
e-mail, will the same thing still happen?

Hello world,

Tonight I compiled Pine3.89 on our RS6000 running AIX3.2
Well, everything went fine, except that I got this message
when I tried to compose a message:

Bug in Pine detected: "Received abort signal".
Exiting pine.
Abort process (core dumped)

Hmmmm, great...any suggestions? Is the solution to this problem
in a FAQ? Pine looks a lot better than Elm and I just wanted
to give it a try, but it won't work.

Thanks for any help.

Good question!  And I don't know the answer either, but I do have a 
'brute force' technique that works:

1) Use Ctrl-K's to delete the .signature that PINE imports.

2) Scroll down to the bottom of your response.

3) Use Ctrl-R to import another .signature.

It may not be pretty, but it works!

In your .pinerc file add the line:

where foldername is the name you want Pine to store your sent mail in.  
Then create a folder by that name in Pine.

That should do it.

I used to do that, and then I looked through my .pinerc, and added the
signature-at-bottom option.

The original poster forgot a line, specifically the one to set ixany.  
Actually, you probably want to set -ixon instead.  That will disable 
XON/XOFF flow control completely.  (I needed to do that to fix a 
similar different problem here.)

#! /bin/sh
STTY=`stty -g`  # save current settings
stty -ixon      # disable XON/XOFF flow control
pine            # execute pine
stty $STTY      # restore settings to previous values.

Simply press '?' on the main menu, see the 'Configurable Features'
entry, note that item 9 says 'Placement of Signature Files', page down
to that item, and there is a lucid and complete explaination.

Brute force has its place, but not here.

Hi all,

PINE does not search in body of message
to find what you are looking for. I view this
as something very easy that should have been
implemented in earlier versions of pine.

Will this be in the next upgrade  .... ?

David Miller:

  We're are updating our local printed Pine documentation this summer, and
it looks like the rough draft is due before Pine 3.90 will be released.
It is possible to get any documentation before the product is ready for
release?

   Thank you,
              Evelyn

Yes, Pine 3.90's "Select" command will allow for full text searching, 
including via IMAP.

Subject: No DNS resolving with PC Pine
Message-Id: <CsuE3z.IE5@gpu.utcc.utoronto.ca>
Date: Tue, 12 Jul 1994 19:28:47 GMT

We are using PC Pine 3.89 and Novell's LWP 4.12 TCP/IP stack.  We are able to
get it to work except for one problem.  In the PINERC file if we specify a
hostname for the inbox-path={hostname.utcc.utoronto.ca}inbox it doesn't work;
instead we have to specify the IP address of our IMAP server,
inbox-path=(hostip}inbox.

We noted that in the INSTALL.TXT file it tells us to set the DOS variable
EXCELAN=C:\NET  (Unfortunately this choice of DOS variable name is not
very illuminating.  It took a bit of head scratching before someone realized
that Excelan was the name of a company that Novell bought out many moons
ago.)  However, when we set EXCELAN things still didn't work.

Finally, on a lark we put the hostname in C:\NET\HOST.  When the EXCELAN DOS
variable is now set, things finally work.  So, I assume that the undocumented
purpose of the EXCELAN variable is to let PC Pine find C:\NET\TCP\HOSTS so it
can fish around in there instead of using the domain name resolver.
Unfortunately, in a University with 70,000 people we don't want hostnames to
be propagated in /etc/hosts files all over--we must use Domain Name Servers.

Does anyone know how to make PC Pine 3.89 use the Novell LWP domain name
resolver rather than a hosts file?

You can only attach it to someone if they have MIME capabilies.  If so, 
then you can simply put the fully qualified filename in the ATTACHMENT 
section of the header.

Hey I am wondering if there is a way to get rid of the confirm delete msg 
that I get as I leave a folder to go to another folder or when I quit pine.

my thoughts are if i delete it then i want it deleted and the 
confirmation part is a hassle.

thanks in advance - andy

Sorry to say, but I had absolutely no problem.  I simply 
modified the pinerc file to point to my server, set the
EXCELAN variable to C:\NET, which is the root directory
for my LWP 4.1 installation.  I have NO hosts file, but a 
simply configured resolv.cfg which does name resolution.

No problems whatsoever

I downloaded the editor called Joe as a tar.Z file. After bashing away at 
the keyboard for a while, I managed to unzip it. So now I have Joe as a 
tar file. Now what? I have tried install, run, joe, and lots of dumber 
things, but the file just sits there and takes up space.

The system here is OSF/1

Subject: Granting UserIDS/E-mail accounts? How are you doing it?
Date: 13 Jul 1994 15:20:06 GMT
Message-Id: <3010n6$rht@hermes.unt.edu>


I am the manager of the Campus Wide Information System here at the
University of North Texas.  As such, some portions of student E-mail
access seem to be my responsibility.  I am interested in your combined
experiences in granting thousands of E-mail/USERIDs to students,
faculty and staff.  Since we are about to embark on a universal
access/electronic application process here at UNT, any input you could
provide could save us quite a bit of time.  The following questions
cover our primary areas of concern:

1. What procedures do students, faculty and staff go through to get an
Internet mail capable E-mail/User ID? (assuming an incoming freshman
who has never had access to anything like this before)

2. Is the above procedure available to students, faculty and staff that
might be only on-campus on the weekends or after-hours?  That is, can
it be access off-campus and if so, through what means (generic
anonymous application process available via modem/VT-100 based
sessions?)

3. What are the qualifications for being able to get a UserID?  (full
time students only, academic status?)

4. Is there a comprehensive database of all eligble people that you
check against when someone applies for an account?  Does the database
cover people that might be gone for the summer, continuing students,
transitional students, part-time student employees and those on
academic probation?

5. Is there any fee associated with using such accounts?  If so, how is
collection of these fees handled and what steps are taken if accounts
are not payed? (including printing fees or generally accessed student
computer use fees.  i.e. how is this system payed for?)

6. Are only UNIX, VAX or IBM-class mainframe accounts available?  What
about Novell or AppleShare based accounts?

7. What remote access methods are available?  (Generic VT-100 or
SLIP/PPP/other LAN based protocal)

8. What software is provided and is it site licesed if there are
SLIP/PPP/LAN protocal based access provided?

9. What method do you have of ensuring that the person filling out an
electronic form for a UserID (I assume that this is the method you use)
is indeed who they say they are?  What athentication scheme is used?
(i.e. checking into a computer lab sufficient enough?)

10. Besides the possible central database that you check against to
ensure that they are a student, are the active E-mail accounts kept in
an X.500 database?  A CSO (Gopher) database or where?


Thanks again greatly for your assistance in this matter.

Hi,

I'm fairly new at this game, so please bear with me!  I am not sure which 
"flavor" of PC-Pine I should download:  f, p, n, or s.  I have a Dell 486 
(running windows) and am on a Microsoft LAN.  I want to send binary files 
via the internet to a party also operating a pc on a novell LAN.  I take it 
PC-Pine can do the text-binary encode/decode for this to work.  Right?

Ajay

Willow is the "Washington Information Looker-upper Layered Over Windows"

It is an X-Mosaic general purpose information retrieval tool that UW
developed as a front-end to our library databases.

Hi all,

	I was wondering if anybody has created a document on thier campus that
explains what Pine is and what some of the basic commands are.  The reason I am
asking is we are trying to have everybody on our system (VAX/VMS, Unix, PC's)
to use Pine for email.  Hopefully this will create less confusion.
	We started to create a sample document, but wanted to look at others
that may have already been created.  I did ftp to ftp.cac.washington.edu to see
if there was anything there and retrieved the pine.blurb and found that useful,
but still would like to see any others that may exist.
	Please email me directly with any examples.

	Thanks,

I am currently trying to us folders on remote machines, and I am wondering 
if there is any way to get pine to automating log you in i.e. just give
your name and password instead on prompting you for it, when you open that
folder.

thank in advance

Dan,

I am assuming the original file was named joe.tar.Z or something close.  
The steps you need to follow are:
	uncompress joe.tar.Z
		This will uncompress the file and leave it as joe.tar
	tar xf joe.tar
		This will un-tar the file to produce whatever was tar'd.

Generally, at this point, you will need to compile and link the files to 
generate the executables.  I don't know anything about 'joe' so excuse 
the vagueness.  Included in the un-tar'd files will probably be some type 
of documentation(e.g. Makefile, Configure, README) on how to create the 
executables.

Hope this helps,

There is a document that was written for the UW Uniform Access systems 
that might be useful.  It is available from ftp.u.washington.edu in the

Thanks to everyone who answered my question. I was indeed able to "tar" 
my joe.tar archive, or untar it I guess, but I ran out of space on my 
disk before it finished.

Thus endeth my adventure in creative editing. I am resigned to using Pico.

Hi all,

I am trying to figure out how to attach to a local news feed with pine.  
Anyone know.  I know the directory where our local news feed is, so I 
shouldn't need to worry about a domain name/nntp.....right?  How do I do it?

Thanks in advnace

	Could someone please direct me to a FAQ on Pine (and/or PC Pine)
before I say something truly flame worthy on this group.

Thanks in advance.

Pine currently assumes that your newsfeed is located in /usr/spool/news 
and the active file is in /usr/lib/news/active.  If that is the case, 

	news-collections=News	*[]

should work.  If not, you might be better off using nntp...

	Well, since I'm running csh, I can do a ctrl-z and put pine
in the background.  When I'm done with what I wanted to do I use fg to
bring pine back.

This is a question about the pine executables.  I tried to 
compile Pine for Solaris and have some fatal errors which 
I am trying to work out.  I won't post them all there since
the errors and warnings are so long.  
 
However, after compile trouble, I decided to try to 
/mail/unix-bin solaris executables.  When I try to run these
I get Execution Permission Denied messages.  
 
To David:  I apologize for originally sending this identical

 Unless you got JOE 1.09, it won't build on OSF/1.

Curious---I have the very same problem; didn't used to, with other email
programs.  Is there something in Pine that causes this problem?  Uploading
an ASCII file gags the email message; sometimes just copying and pasting a
brief chunk of text makes it gag.  Any clues, anyone?

Clue #1

	Be more specific about your operating environment.

	What do you mean by "upload my ACSII file"?  What type of 
terminal emulation software are you using?  Are you using a direct async

Subject: Detecting incoming mail in more than one inbox
Message-Id: <CswBGq.1IG@cid.aes.doe.ca>
Date: Wed, 13 Jul 1994 20:26:47 GMT

Thanks to procmail and pine,  my incoming mail now gets sorted 
into separate inboxes, depending on what the message is about, 
where it came from, etc.

 The only problem is that now I only get paged when new mail 
comes into the _default_ mailbox; but I also would like to be alerted
when mail comes into some of my other incoming folders.  I suppose 
I could have a separate xbiff for each mailbox, but that doesn't 
strike me as very elegant, and it would clutter my desktop. 

Is there a simple,  automatic way to check more than one mailbox 
for incoming  mail?

Thanks

Yves

Has anyone been able to build Pine 3.89 under Interactive?  If so, what
hoops did you have to jump through to get it to build?

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

I don't know how to do this with pico but maybe the folks in comp.mail.pine 
or comp.editors know...

For these you can use pico with the -t flag (tool mode), i.e., for nn put 
the following in ~/.nn/init

   set editor pico -t

Or if you're using csh (or one of its relatives) you can put these two
lines in your .login:

   setenv EDITOR 'pico -t'
   setenv VISUAL $EDITOR


Hope this helps,
Nancy

The Korn shell and recent versions of the Bourne shell support MAILPATH
and MAILCHECK environment variables that let you poll multiple mailboxes
at specified intervals.

	We have just installed dos pine with pine getting mail
from a unix server through IMAP.  We are just wondering if
there is a way for the DOS machines to be notified if there
is new mail without going into pine.

Most shells allow you to specify a list of files to be checked for new
mail. In sh, ksh or bash you can set a colon seperated list of files in
the environment variable MAILPATH. Csh has something similar, I forget
the details. Check the man page for your favourite shell.

You can use the +nn flag to pico to specify what line to position the 
cursor to, but it does not know how to parse for the end of the headers.  
E.g.

	pico +11 file

will open file and position the cursor to line 11.  I will leave it to 
the NN experts to give the aqppropriate magic to compute "+11"...

Subject: pine3.89 for IRIX locks when opening folders
Date: Thu, 14 Jul 1994 11:18:03
Message-Id: <black.201.000B4D5A@csulb.edu>

I just installed Pine 3.89 on my Silicon Graphics system running IRIX 5.2.  
When running pine, it creates two default folders 
  saved-messages
  sent-mail

If I try to open either of these two empty folders, pine hangs.  
Yes, the folders are not on the local hard disk, but are accessed from
and NFS file server.  I read some recent posts about using IMAP.
However, these didn't give many details.  How can I correct this problem?

In various Bourne-shell derivatives, there is a mailpath environment variable.
In various csh derivatives, there is a mail shell variable.

But ince you mentined xbiff, there was a program posted to one of the .sources
newsgroups a few weeks ago, called "xmultibiff" which is a xbiff that can
do more than one mail-folder.  It can also beep you when news-articles arrive
and all sorts of other stuff.  You might want to try and see if you can find
that program too.

you have to untar it, (paint thinner, solvent, etc.)

or you could use 'tar -xvf joe.tar'

that would be easiest, I guess

and you should find your joe executable somewhere


if it doesn't work, let me know

There is an application called "xmultibiff" which allows one to do this.

I think I got it from ftp.x.org

Thanks. That's exactly what I was looking for. Our system defaults to csh,
though.  Minor bummer...  I'll have to switch shells to get what I want.

Neil,

You are right, of course. I just checked: the C shell allows multiple files
to be listed in the "mail" variable. For instance:

set mail=(/users/yves/mail/default /users/yves/mail/wx-talk /users/yves/mail/op-met)

I hope I got that right...

Pine on Unixware Summary

	How to compile:

	Make the following changes to the pine/osdep/os-sv4.h file:
	1. remove the comment on  the line that has #define ANSI
	2. comment out the line that defines const (#define const ) 
	3. change the line for sendmail location to /usr/ucblib/sendmail
	4. Change the defines so that pine/pico will use TERMINFO instead
	   of TERMCAP.
	5. USE the BUILD script build sv4    trying to make pine alone
		does not work well.
	6. move the binaries and give proper permissions.

	Other Notes:
	While you are in the os-sv4.h file check to make sure this is 
	setup the way you want it. 


	I am still using the default mail setup with unixware and I did 
	make the change on page 8 of the unixware release notes (ie add -r).

	SYSTEM:  unixware version 1.1 installed from cd with SDK and 
	TCP/IP, but nothing special.  So hope this helps the others who
	sent mail and asked to report my results.

	Thanks to those a who helped!  
 
The only other note I have to add is this:  I cant remember if I used gcc 
or the SDK to compile, but I think is was SDK.  Clean the distribution 
before you compile.  I have found it best to build the entire set from 
the begining.  I think make clean will clean up for you, but I have 
compiled to many things inthe last couple weeks I cant remember.

Good luck.

BTW, gcc installs easily, you just ahve to follow all the steps.

Hello,

I am needing help on how the folder locking mechanism works within PINE.  
I would like to know what does pine has to go through in order to do the 
folder locking.  In other words, what is the algorithm/procedures of the 
locking mechanism.  If any of you out there know about this problem, can 
you email to me or post on this newsgroup.  I am very appreciate it.  
Thank you.

You have the source (or can fetch it from ftp.cac.washington.edu); if
you're in a hurry then a tool like trace or truss can give some hints.
For instance, I ran 'truss -topen pine' and here's (part of) the
output.  In that session, I saved a message from my inbox to the
saved-messages folder.  It looks like on my system, pine uses a lock
file.  (That might well be system dependent.)

open("/var/mail/jdavis.lock", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0666) = 6
open("/var/mail/jdavis", O_RDWR, 0)		= 6
open("/home/jdavis/mail/saved-messages", O_RDONLY, 0) = 6
open("/home/jdavis/mail/saved-messages", O_RDONLY, 0) = 6
open("/home/jdavis/mail/saved-messages.lock", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0666) = 6
open("/home/jdavis/mail/saved-messages", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0600) = 6
open("/var/mail/jdavis.lock", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0666) = 6

	Write a mail to your friend.  On the header line "Attachment:", 
press "Control-J".  You'll then be prompted for a filename and you can 
write short description of this file as attached with your mail.

	Mind the file size of 10MB.  Though your account can hold it, 
your friend's may not.  You may want to compress it before attaching it 
to the mail.  Common compression programs like PKZIP/LHA/GZIP may help.  
Of course you friend shoud have a copy of the same compression program to 
be able to decompress the file.

Be aware too, that even if your account can hold a file of that size, and 
your friend's account can also, the same may not be true of the 
intermediary mail systems between your two sites! For example, mail from 
colleagues of mine in the UK is limited by the gateway (nsfnet-relay) to 
500K messages, even though they could send 10Mb, and I could 
(technically) receive!

You may want to check out a program to split the file into pieces, eg. 
the GNU split program will work on both byte and line counts.

Hope this helps,

Anyone have clarity as to why Pine won't let me access/save/view this MIME 
enclosure? I already had the person at our site request they not send it 
in uuencoded format and haven't seen any problems with pine handling MIME 
before.
Thanks

>From the upcoming Pine FAQ:

What is folder locking and how does it work? 

Locks are used by Pine and other mail programs to prevent damage from
occurring to the mail file when multiple programs try to write to the file at
the same time. 

Because there are many different schemes of mail file locking used on UNIX,
Pine implements all of them. The result is a lot of complexity. 

There are several reasons why locking needs to be done: 

 1. If you want to read the mail file, you want to make sure that no other
process will modify the mail file while you are reading it. 

 2. If you want to write to the mail file, you want to make sure that no
other process is accessing the mail file while you are writing it. 

 3. If you have the mail file open, you want to make sure that no other
process can alter any of the internal contents of the mail file that you have
read, but it is OK if another process appends new data to the mail file. 

 4. If you want to alter any of the internal contents of the mail file, you
want to make sure that no other process has the mail file open. 

There are several mechanisms of locking: 

The creation of a file which has the same name as the mail file, but with a
suffix of ".lock" (for example, this lock for /usr/spool/mail/isma is named
/usr/spool/mail/isma.lock). This file accomplishes locks (1) and (2) above. 
This is an exclusive lock. 
   The use of an flock() with LOCK_SH on the mail file. This accomplishes
lock (1), and prevents lock (2). Multiple processes can do this. 
   The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on the mail file. This accomplishes
lock (2), and prevents lock (1). This is an exclusive lock. 
   The use of an flock() with LOCK_EX on a file on /tmp. The file name used
depends upon the version of Pine. This accomplishes locks (3) and (4). This
is an exclusive lock. 

On SVR4-based systems, the lockf() subroutine or fcntl() system call it used
instead of flock(). It is rumored that this creates a kind of lock file as
well, but this has not been directly verified.

Rather than giving up, Dan....Why not transfer
the joe file to another disk, if you have access.
For instance, there may be more room in the var
or opt directory?

_All_?  How did you find out the scheme _I_ use? = )

I am locked out of a Friday-night date, so decided to make up by reading
"c-client" code having to do with locks....

Mark, see signature. = )

Pardon the unaffected simplicy, but what happens if multiple processes
decide to "grab it for ourselves." 

[...]

Please explain why you don't check whether "flock (fd,op)" above succeeds.

Thanks!

Message-Id: <307vq2$l1l@nyx.cs.du.edu>

I have been using pine for years now and refuse to use any other mailer. 
It seems so full featured that I think the others would only dissapoint. 
I was wondering though if pine could be used to create an automatic 
listserver? I realize that this is not perhaps strictly a mail 
applications job but I thought I'd ask anyway. If the answer is no (1) 
are there plans to include this in later versions and (2) does anyone 
know of other unix applications that can do the job?

Thanks

I use pine under UNIX on a DEC Alpha. I had a line in my .login:

test -s /usr/spool/mail/$USER && echo "You might have mail, I can't tell"

That told me when I had new mail (I changed the text when I started using
Pine) but it doesn't work with Pine - It always flags as having new mail

Is there any way I can still do this?

Dos anyone know if there is a version of pine for os2, or if anyone
is working on a port?

Also, is there a dos pine version that has been written to use the ibm tcpip
kernel.  If there is no os2 version of pine, it might be possible to use pine 
in a dos session under os2, as long as it can talk to the ibm tcpip stack.

Is there anyone porting pcpine to os2?  Even a character based version
would be nice.  If not, is anyone using the DOS version of pine under
os2 successfully?  I have ibm's tcpip stack.  I have only seen pcpine for

I recently installed pine3.8.9 on a Sparc 5 running SunOS 4.1.3_U1.
I also am running shadow passwording. The problem is that if I go
into setup within pine, I am allowed to change my passwd, which is
then changed in /etc/passwd, NOT /etc/security/passwd.adjunct. This
of course defeats the purpose of shadow passwords. HELP!!!!!!

Worked for me on a Solaris 2.3 machine.

But there is a serious security problem here.  If you look at the
implementation in osdep/chnge_pw, you'll see

    strcpy(cmd_buf, "passwd");
    system(cmd_buf);

Note a relative pathname is used.  This is vulnerable to Trojans in
your $PATH.  I wish I'd noticed the password-changing function before;
looks like I'll be doing a quick edit and recompiling pine on a few
platforms tonight!

I don't see why a mail user agent needs a password-changing function
at all, but this implementation is seriously broken.  Besides the
security hole, passwd isn't necessarily the right program to call.  On
some systems it should be yppasswd or nispasswd instead.

    No.  Pine3.89 can be used to read, but does not permit you to post
news articles directly.  Await Pine3.90 eagerly for this.
    To post, you must use methods used by those with read-only access to
a news server, namely, posting by means of a mail-to-news gateway.

I tried using Pine3.89 to read news via nntp from our local server, and
was (I'm afraid) unimpressed with the user interface; just as a matter
of interest, are there any plans to introduce threading in a later
version?

	Sir & Whoever Else is interested .....

	If you are using a UNIX Pine, you are on a UNIX system.
	By definition, that's on-line.  I'm not sure if Pine
	is offered in a Windoze or Mac version or not, but
	that is what you are looking for. 

	If there is such a Pine, it would need to be bundled
	with some sort of software that downloads the mail
	to your machine.  This might be SLIP, with TCP/IP
	and SMTP with POP2 or POP3.

	Or it could use something else all-together.

	You might try checking out one of the Off-Line Mail
	Readers for Windoze or Mac........


	Yours ....... Richard C Schmidt

There is a group of us here interested in precisely these issues.  OS/2
and IBM's TCP/IP for OS/2 provides a really excellent and easily
maintained general computing platform, and it would be really nice to have
a client-type mail program such as pine.

After our systems got broken in a few months ago, PINE was one of the 
pkgs I rebuilt on all of our 5 platforms to take out the password 
changing ``feature'' (which means that I can't use the pre-compiled 
binaries ... sigh).

I can see the use of having this, since you might want to have email-only
accounts, with a hacked-up PINE as your shell -- but that's probably
not common at most sites. My recommendation would be take it out
completely, or if not, do a better job of calling the underlying password 
routines to handle NIS+/NIS/C2 etc systems transparently as well.

Perhaps the full pathname to the appropriate password program could be
#define'd in the appropriate osdep/os-xxx.h header file; then it would
be a configurable option for systems where there are different
possible choices.  Even then calling system() wouldn't be wise -- the
pathname argument could be subverted by games with the IFS environment
variable.  An explicit fork and exec would be safer.  Leaving out this
option altogether would be safer still.

Dear All,

Situation:	pine3.89 running on Linux box (mailserver)
		pine3.89 running on DECstation (user machine)
		imapd running on mailserver

I have tried various combinations of configuration file but with no 
success. When our email users send mail internally, or Cc: a copy to 
themselves, the "From:" part of the address always reads:

	From: 	user@rosa.esb.ucp.pt

(where rosa is the name of our mailhost).

I have tried setting the use-domain-name-only option, and also setting 
the user-domain explicitly (separately and in combination for these 
options -- and I know that the latter means the former is not used!)

When I examine the mail headers directly, the From: line simply has the 
username (eg. From: jjsc) with the full name and machine.host part being 
added by Pine. So, my question is, is there any way to force pine to 
_always_ use only the domain (esb.ucp.pt) in this case, for _any_ local 
address?

If I've overlooked something obvious, flame me, but tell me first what I 
missed!

Many thanks in advance,

John

Subject: PINE and PC-NFS


  I'm new to PINE and this list, and am having some trouble with PC-PINE
  for PC-NFS.  I've installed a couple of users, that work just fine, but
  this morning I was unable to get a user going.  PINE would not open
  his INBOX, complaining that it couldn't find the host.  The main
  difference between the systems, is that the ones that work use PC-NFS
  4.0, and the one that doesn't is using PC-NFS 3.5.  Does PC-PINE not
  work with pre-4.0 PC-NFS?  The PC has several file systems mounted from
  that host, so it's not actually unreachable, but for some reason PINE
  can't handle the host name.  We can upgrade that PC-NFS, but I'd like
  to be sure there's no other way, first.  Thanks much for any assistance!

Date: 18 Jul 1994 17:10:15 GMT
Message-Id: <30ed1n$d32@news.cs.tulane.edu>

Hi,

	I would like to run PINE on our SunOS 5.3 (version 4), but the
pine documentation tells me that it does not support that platform.  Is 
this true, and is there another way to get PINE up and running.  

	ALSO, I would at least like to use pico on our system, since vi
is terrible.  The docs say that pico is a stand-alone text editor.  Does
this mean I can get it by itself (without PINE)?  I did not see pico at
the ftp site.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

Subject: disallowing pine to be suspended vai ctrl-z

Not being a codesmith, I need a pointer as to where and what to
change to disallow pine to be placed in the background.  I thought
it would not do that if the -z flag weren't used, but it appears
that enabling 'feature old-growth' bypasses the commandline flag.
I don't mind doing this in the pine.conf file, but we've enabled
all the rich features to cover all those users that think they
need them.  Administratively, it would benefit us to disallow
ctrl-z suspension, however.

I don't know what you mean by "SunOS 5.3 (version 4)", but pine 3.89
runs on Solaris 2.3 machines.  You need to make a trivial change
to pine/makefile.sol:

Ooof.  It looks like pine actually reads Ctrl-Z.  (So much for trap ''
24 or even stty -isig!)  So if I'm reading the code in signals.c right
about your only option is to recompile after changing have_job_control
in osdep/jobcntrl to return 0 instead of 1.  (Or maybe take out the
include(jobcntrl) statement from your os-xxx.ic.)

I tried it however it asks for Packet Driver, which yet I don't have.

I don't.  I apply all of them.

This is unlikely to happen due to the nature of this particular lock.  It 
is also unavoidable due to the nature of this particular lock.  Blame 
the people who designed locking of UNIX mail files 15+ years ago; it's 
all their fault.

Fortunately, as noted above, it is very unlikely to happen.  This 
particular lock is used only for brief periods of time.  If something has 
it seized for 5 minutes, something is wrong.  There is some level of 
protection in that the file date is checked.

> > Please explain why you don't check whether "flock (fd,op)" above succeeds.

The blocking form of flock() is used.  It always succeeds.  If the file 
is locked, it will hang.

Subject: Pine won't read /etc/aliases?
Date: Tue, 19 Jul 1994 06:37:29 GMT
Message-Id: <Ct6D2I.4D0@crash.cts.com>

I am running Pine 3.89 under SunOS 4.1.3.  I like it a lot!

The only problem I have is with mail addressing.  Sometimes it bounces
mail immediately, when the address looks ok to me.

I think the problems arise when the user is on the local net, and I
use an address like: user@hostname, instead of user@domainname.  I
think I also have problems when using multiple To: addressess,
separated by commas; sometimes it seems to bounce one of them, even
though if I resend it to that single address, it mails fine.

BTW, if it makes a difference, I have Pine set up to use domain-name
only.

Since I have an extensive /etc/aliases file, which points all likely
addresses to the correct user@hostname or user@domainname, I think my
problem would be solved if Pine would read the aliases file.  Although
mailtool reads it fine, Pine does not seem to.

Any hints would be appreciated.

Thank you.

Has anyone adapted the pine IMAP code to work under term (the slip-esque
unix<->unix serial line protocol) yet? If not, and you've got a couple of
minutes to do it, I'd really like to see it working.

This would allow easy function as an offline mail reader for, at least, home

	The best thing you can do is to get "filter" from the elm
distribution, or procmail, or deliver, or one of the other various
filter programs.  Then, you can detect incoming mail from the offending
(or is that offensive ?) person and direct it to its proper location...
/dev/null.  Chances are you will find that these programs can be of
more value than just dumping annonying email. 

	Good luck...

	What you really want to know is if the UA (User Agent) the other
person is using is MIME capable.  The only reliable way to determine 
this is to "ask" the intended receipient if their UA is MIME capable.
This is generally a good idea....before you send that 1M byte GIF file
only to find out that the other person can't handle it.

Hello there...

Sorry to trouble everyone with this,
but I'm not sure where-else to
address this query to...

I ftp'ed straight executables
of pine and pico for the Sun
onto my system... (because
of not having, or rather
experiencing problems with
the C-compiler at our site)

Pico works fine, but Pine
is for some reason stuck
in debug mode, so typing 'pine'
is the equivalent of 'pine -d 4'?
because I end up with a total number
of 4 .pine-debug reports before they
loop around again...

Is this a problem with my system,
or is pine (3.89 in this case)
meant to default to debug mode?

It doesn't seem to be experiencing
any problems with my system, it
just automatically gives me a
debug report anyway.

Can I cure this?

Is there somewhere I can contact 
about bugs or for help?

Thanks a lot...

This isn't really a job for a Mail User Agent (MUA) like pine, but for
a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) such as Chip Salzenberg's deliver.  An
MDA is a program that examines incoming mail and determines whether to
put it in the user's INBOX, deliver it so one or more other addresses,
drop the mail....  I use it to automatically archive incoming mail by
year, month, system, and user, to check mailing list traffic for
duplicates before forwarding, and to assign incoming email for support
to the appropriate person.

Deliver looks for a $HOME/.deliver script which may be any executable
program (mine are in perl).  This is invoked by putting
"|/usr/lib/mail/deliver username" in the .forward file.

mailtool) hand off the message you want to send to sendmail to do the
real work of delivery.  So it sounds to me like a sendmail problem.
You can use /usr/ucb/Mail on your Sun to troubleshoot this: try

Mail -v user

and watch the resulting chatter.  Another debugging trick is to telnet
to the smtp port on the machine you want to send mail to and use the
'vrfy' and 'expn' commands to check out alias expansion:

telnet some-machine-name 25
[ ... startup chatter from remote sendmail ... ]
vrfy some-name
expn some-name
quit

Message-Id: <1994Jul19.100038.4913@rivers>
Date: 19 Jul 94 10:00:37 -0600

Hello,

   I am trying to install PC-Pine 3.89 for Packet Drivers on our 
Network.  It will be running in a DOS window on Windows 3.1.
I want users to be able to store personal information on
a diskette.  Right now I am trying to get Pine to look for the PINERC
file in the a:\pine directory.  The problem is it keeps trying to look 
for the PINERC file in the H:\PINE directory it creates.  I have tried 
setting the working directory to be a:\pine, but that doesn't work.  
Is their an enviornment variable I could set for this?   Also it there
a file I could modify to tell Pine to create the default PINERC file on 
the a:\pine directory rather than a h:\pine?
   
Thanks for any help,
Email reponses preferred.

The easiest way to handle that would be to write a small program using
c-client.  Take a look at imapcopy.tar.Z or mbxcvt.tar.Z in the mail
directory on ftp.cac.washington.edu for sample c-client programs...

This isn't the same as IMAP, but it might be what you need.

For sending mail, you could (as root) tredir 25 25 to redirect your local 
smtp port to the internet connected host's smtp port.  Then set smtp-server
to "localhost" in your .pinerc.

There are packages on sunsite that handle incoming mail.

    Pine's default is to create up to four debug files, at I forget what
debug level, so that if there are problems, there is something available
to be looked at.  Otherwise, they get overwritten and merely use space
until that time when you do need to refer to them, so they're harmless,
yet beneficial.


>Is there somewhere I can contact

    To report bugs, write to <pine-bugs@cac.washington.edu>.
There is a good on-line help built into Pine, and the tech-notes that
come with the distribution are often enough to answer your questions.
If you still can't resolve something, you could post here (as you have
just done) and someone could help you, be it another user with an answer
or the Pine Team for the authoritative Word.

    The only way, if the other person cannot tell you and you can't
figure it out from mail you receive (note that a header MIME-Version: 1.0
line is not necessarily enough to guarantee MIME capability), is to send
a short MIME message, such as attaching a single-line text file of
This is a test
which would then be sent as a MIME attachment.  If you get a reply asking
"WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT YOU JUST SENT" then your recipient is not using
a MIME mailreader (though there may be one available).  If you receive
mail from the other person which has a Message-ID: header with a Pine
version, then that other person is using Pine.  If, say, you see a header
of X-Mailer: ELM whatever, then maybe it will work, so you have to try
the test suggested above.  If you yourself have received MIME mail, then
of course that sender is MIME-aware.

    You can, of course, suggest the recipient obtain a MIME program, be
it Pine, Pegasus mail, mpack, or metamail, among others.  Pine will add
a few lines to caution the recipient that what follows is a MIME message,
and those lines will not be displayed by a MIME-aware mail program.

I'm trying to get a feeling for how much horsepower to takes
to support how many users with IMAP.

If you run one or more IMAP servers, could you please take a moment
to email me the hardware, and software you use, and how many users
you support.  How much disk space per user do you plan for, and do
you have any space policy in effect.

If I get enough answers to be interesting, I'm willing to post
a summary to the net.

In my discussions with ISA Corporation regarding ECSMail, it was revealed
to me that the PINE development team intents to support the .mailboxlist
file to keep track of folder subscriptions in the future.  This support
would go a long way to solving what is probably going to become a large
problem in the near future.  I have a couple of questions though:

1.  When is this support planned to be implemented?

2.  Will .mailboxlist be updated by non-IMAP UNIX PINE?  For my site,
    it is important that the file is.  When the users are on UNIX,
    we don't use IMAP as we can use NFS with less of a performance
    penalty.  However, these users may be hoping on PC-PINE or
    ECSMail too.

Thanks,

We have just installed ULTRIX 4.4 (upgrade over ULTRIX 4.3).  Do we need 
to recompile PINE to use the new ULTRIX release?

Thanks in advance.

I see references in the sources for PICO to a "restricted mode"

What we are trying to do is to be able to invoke EITHER pine with a FIXED 
To:, no attachment, and NO "TO FILES" etc, so that we can give people we 
don't trust too much the ability to use this freindly mail rather than 
plain mail.

Alternatively, we would like to be able to call up pico to edit a file, 
(prenamed) and not allow saving to other file names etc., reading from 
other files...the usual security limitation attempts.

Date: 20 Jul 1994 00:24:32 +0930
Message-Id: <30gpf8$pfp@eve.adam.com.au>

Just a collection of small nits:

1) pico has an inverse "." on the top line; could this be removed?

2) Could pine have an option to turn off the menus? My users say that 
it's great for the first week, but then they want more screen space.

3) Several of my users don't like "pico". They prefer "joe". Could there 
be an option to go straight into the alternate editor after filling out 
the headers?

4) When suspending pine with ^Z, it sends a stop signal to all processes 
on that group (with "kill(0, SIGSTOP);" in pine/os.c). This causes a 
problem when pine isn't run from the main process.

Perhaps "kill(getpid(), SIGSTOP);" would be better, since then the
fork()/wait() in the calling program can then handle it however it
pleases. Currently, the (in my case) menu program thinks it was asked to
stop, and even if I get the menu program to ignore this signal, bash still
gets it and stops anyway.

Hello there...

Sorry to trouble everyone with this,
but I'm not sure where-else to
address this query to...

I ftp'ed straight executables
of pine and pico for the Sun
onto my system... (because
of not having, or rather
experiencing problems with
the C-compiler at our site)

Pico works fine, but Pine
is for some reason stuck
in debug mode, so typing 'pine'
is the equivalent of 'pine -d 4'?
because I end up with a total number
of 4 .pine-debug reports before they
loop around again...

Is this a problem with my system,
or is pine (3.89 in this case)
meant to default to debug mode?

It doesn't seem to be experiencing
any problems with my system, it
just automatically gives me a
debug report anyway.

Can I cure this?

Thanks a lot...

Peter Bates,
University of Bradford,UK.

Thanks, Jim.

I know about sendmail; the reason I suspect a Pine problems is that I
have been using mailtool on the same system for 2 years without any
major problems; all of a sudden I switch to Pine, and I have lots of
problems.  It's the old "if b after a, then a causes b"; I don't
remember the Latin for it, and I know it's not logically valid.

I'll have to do some more testing, and I'm sure your tips will come in
handy.  BTW, I have been checking the mail addresses that bounce using
sendmail -bv, and they always seem to check out ok!

Billy,
As you know, Pine currently uses folder collection definitions for
specifying what folders are visible.  I can't say when .mailboxlist support
might happen, but I would appreciate it if you would send me a note
outlining what problem you are trying to solve, and how you would use
.mailboxlist to solve it. 

Also, re NFS vs. IMAP performance: the tests I've run indicate that 
opening a large folder via IMAP is *much* faster than via NFS, although
operations such as CREATE are faster via NFS (not surprising, since NFS 
is stateless).  As for load on the server, it depends a lot on the 
mailbox format.  I assume you are using Bky mbox, as opposed to, say, 
the more efficient Tenex format...

(In the future you'll also have the option of using an IMAP server that 
stores messages in a pre-parsed format that makes for extremely efficient 
access.)

     I would like to use pc-pine with a uucp mailer (or other kluge to 
get mail from the pc to a UNIX machine without a slip link).  To do this, 
I need to have pine simply write outgoing files to disk for later 
transport and have pine read incoming messages from an inbox.  Is there 
some simple way to do this using the pre-compiled pc-pine versions, or do I 
have to (shutter, gasp) mess with source code?
	Thanks for the help!

Question: Is there anyway to use a template/form in Pine.
I realize this is odd for a mail program but here is the reason.
We have software that is being used by our markets. It would be 
great if they went into Pine and chose a template for a bug report
or change/enhancment form. This way the bug or change request is
logged and handled in one shot. Cuts down on paper, phone calls, etc..

Anyway thanks.

Kenny,

Pine keeps the last 4 .pine-debug files to help with troubleshooting if
problems occur.  You never know when they will come in handy, but...  To turn
them off, start Pine with the "-d0" command line option. 

Thanks for the reuqest!

In the pine3.89 source code, it looks like NEW_MAIL_TIME, #define'd to
be 150 seconds in pine/os.h, is the thing to change.  I haven't tried
that though.

Not desiring to set a match to anyone's flamethrower... 

I presently only subscribe to the pine-info mailing list and not the
comp.mail.pine newsgroup (so maybe this is my own problem). I'm wondering
if there is interest here to split out comp.mail.pine into two groups. For
example,

  comp.mail.pine-admin &             [techinical/admin discussions]
  comp.mail.pine-user,               [end-user questions/FAQs/etc.]

where pine-admin would remain linked with pine-info (perhaps alias
pine-admin -> pine-info would be good too). My purpose in following the
discussions and occasionally participating in this list is to enhance the
administration of my systems for my users. Maybe this is selfish of me. It
doesn't require an enormous amount of work on my part to skip through the
end-user questions (how to use the interface, people who don't read
on-line help, etc.) to find the juicy bits (like PEM/PGP support debates
[grin]). However, I'd much rather subscribe to a more technical channel
from the sysadmin's perspective (the way pine-info used to be). I already
have a pocketful of user's coming to me for answers. 

Is this an acceptable subject for the group? I'm sure I'll find out.

You have two choices:

	1. Dig into the source.

	2. Wait for us to implement disconnected operation.

Some mail sent with Pine 3.89 ends up with "Reply-To:" and "Sender:" 
headers, regardless of whether it is actually sent with the Reply option.
These headers are correct but are unwanted.

Thanks.

feature-list is a comma separated list of features. You use the feature-list 
to specify various things including the placement of your .signature file.
Here's my feature list from my .pinerc file:

feature-list=enable-unix-pipe-cmd,
	enable-suspend,
	enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
	quit-without-confirm,
	enable-jump-shortcut,
	enable-goto-cmd,
	signature-at-bottom   # this is the part you're looking for!!

Is there any way to remap keys in pine?  I am particularly interested in 
using Esc instead of ^C and anything instead of ^^.

Thanks,

I am running Pine 3.89 on Linux 1.09 -- I have my system clock
set to GMT, but would like Pine to display the message as being sent
in Local time (PDT at the moment).

Is there a variable in .pinerc or somewhere else that can be set?

I don't seem to find any reference to this when scanning Pine's "help"
for either "TZ, Zone, Time" et cetera.

Any help would be appreciated.

    The problem with using ESC is that it is the prefix character used
for arrow keys on many terminals.  Pine can figure out whether you typed
an arrow key or an ESC if it is followed by another character (I believe
Pine also understands a few other ESC sequences from ISO 2022).  But, if
no character follows the ESC, as if you've decided to cancel a message
in composition, Pine can't tell if you've just hit ESC, or an arrow key,
whose remaining characters (perhaps [A ) will arrive shortly if a packet
got lost somewhere.
    I guess this could work in the highlighted prompt (PINE EMERGENCY EXIT:
Really ABORT, dump CORE, and reboot the SYSTEM right NOW??!? [y/n/^C]) where
a single character is expected.
    Also, you can start Pine in a mode where function keys execute the
commands, instead of control characters.

    These headers appear when your composition is postponed.  There is a
good reason for them, and Pine3.90 will make use of them to permit you
to customize headers within Pine to redirect replies (as I have done
with this newspost; mailing list victims will probably see the list as
the reply field).  At present it's possible for you to manually edit
them to redirect mail replies.

    I would suggest, rather than create a parallel group under comp.mail,
that a new hierarchy under comp.mail.pine be created.  comp.mail.pine.* ,
such as, say, comp.mail.pine.tech, comp.mail.pine.misc (which could serve
as todays' comp.mail.pine, eventually comp.mail.pine as a newsgroup itself
could be removed and replaced by the misc group if so desired).
    The reason being that there is a single group for Elm, and it is better

    Also, pine-announce could be gatewayed to a comp.mail.pine.announce (moderated).
And comp.mail.pine.bugs, if there is interest...
not to create so many parallel groups.

Pardon me, I don't understand.  What's a good reason for adding these

One minor point I didn't see mentioned in the tech-notes (or
elsewhere); Solaris 2.x uses the System V mail setup, so the spool
directory is in the mail group, mode 775, and user's mail files are
also in the mail group, mode 770.  Hence pine has to be installed
setgid mail.  (This has some interesting consequences for the
system("passwd") problem I mentioned earlier.)

Date: 21 Jul 94 17:49:53 GMT
Message-Id: <bparker.774812993@interaccess>

I am tired of the collection of .pine-debug* files in my home directory.  
I know there is a compiler switch that will turn it off, but I can't get 
my sysadmin to recompile.  So I was please to learn of the -d0 switch 
that can be used on the command line calling pine.  It tried it, but I 
get a system hang when exiting Pine.  If I set -d1 then I still get some 
debug files, but i can exit ok.

Any clues on why the exit hang with -d0?

Thanks.

Create a file named "elmheader" . In it write:

and place it in your .elm directory.

We're running Pine 3.87 at the moment (with great joy and success).
What's the most recent version?  And, speaking from a harried system
administrator's point of view, is there good reason to upgrade?

Thanks for the info and opinions.

HELP on the Main menu gives that,

      11. Alternate Editor for Composing Messages

There are two ways to get Pine to use an alternate editor for composing
messages.  One option is to choose an editor ahead of time and set the
"editor" variable in your Pine configuration file.  If this is done,
"^_ Alt Edit" will show in the menu of the composer.  The second option
is to enable the feature "enable-alternate-editor-cmd" in the Pine
configuration variable "feature-list".  Then you can give the "^_"
command while in the composer even if it is not shown on the menu.  You
will be prompted for the name of the editor to invoke.  At present you
cannot edit the header with the alternate editor.

There are some potentially severe bugs in Pine 3.87 that are fixed in Pine
3.89.  Pine 3.90 will be coming out soon, but it will be considered a beta
release since there is a large quantity of relatively new code in it.  We are
hoping to nail down a stable 3.9x by the start of Fall Quarter...

I use the filter program for sorting my incoming mail and at each login
an awk program checks the log file of filter and sends me a summary mail
of all mails that were sorted by filter. This gives you enough overview
not to miss any important (interesting) presorted mail.

I assume there is a log file for procmail etc. too.

A small shell script in your .login (for csh) invokes all:

#!/bin/sh
awk -f $HOME/.elm/filter.log.awk $HOME/.elm/filterlog \
| elm -s FilterLog $USER
date > $HOME/.elm/filterlog

---------------------------------------------------------------
The log of filter looks like this:

Mail from dlm@cac.washington.edu about Re: Should we upgrade?
        (addressed to pine-info@cac.washington.edu)
        SAVED in file "/usr1/users/bodo/mail/pine" by rule #1

Mail from bodo about FilterLog
        PUT in mailbox: the default action

I am running Pine on an RS/6000 AIX v3.2.4.  I can sedn one message, but  
can not send a second.  When I hit C to compose the second time, it locks  
up my terminal.  I can go to another terminal and Pine is still running.   
I have run Pine with a Debug level of nine, and have received the  
following output after sending the message:

I am going to Hawaii for two weeks in early August and was wondering how 
to bounce incoming internet e-mail.  I am going to use my CompuServe 
address as CompuServe has a POP in Hawaii.  Can this be done with Pine?

I use lynx as a menu system (as well as a web browser). So of course
one of teh items is E-Mail via Pine. The problem comes in that after
training the user to hit "Left-Arrow" to back out of everything in
lynx, it does nothing in Pine (except complain). Is there a fix for
this?

telnet program CUTCP, I just get a space (CTRL-@ does nothing).

	Sounds like what you are looking for is a "forward" ability.
You want email that is coming into one account to be "forwarded" to
another account.  That is not the function of a UA such as pine.
In systems that utilize sendmail you'd add a .forward file in your
$HOME directory.  That file would contain the email address you want
your email "forwarded" to.  If you wish a copy retained on that
system you'd enter a \ followed by your user name.

e.g.

\daniel
dan@someother.place.com

	Hummm.....I've never seen that happen....and I've used pine and
pico over a modem for about 1.5 years now.  Have you considered that
maybe the problem lies with the modem configuration?  In many cases
a modem is configured such that three + symbols will return it to 
command mode.  Suggest you check your register settings.  I'm
at home and don't have my modem book handy.......

You don't want to bounce mail, you want to forward it.  (Okay, terminology
difference.) Ideally, the transport agent should do this for you without
any intervention from Pine or any other user agent. 

If you're on a Unix system you can create a ".forward" file in your home
directory which should redirect all your mail to a specified address.  If
you're on some other system or are using a restricted shell, ask your
sysadmin the best way to go about it on your system.

    I got to thinking last night, which seems to happen sometimes when I 
should be sleeping.  I've inadvertently used some Emacs META-whatever 
commands as ESC-whatever while in Pico, which appear to be bound to not 
Emacs functions, but the vi *beep* function.  So, why shouldn't Pico
understand these ESC sequences too.

    I am aware that one of the original design goals of Pine was a 
simple, user-friendly MUA, thus the help lines at the bottom, and the 
decision to use single control-key commands for all functions.  Well, 
from what I understand, Pine3.90 will break that tradition by using a 
pair of keys to move to the beginning and end of a text.  I am not 
suggesting you abandon the current keymappings, but, I just checked to 
see what results various ESC-whatever would get me.

    I was speculating that ESC is reserved to be followed by...
another ESC, for use when a control key doesn't work;
[ for some arrow keys
O for some function keys
ABCD for other arrow keys
and probably a bunch more for ISO 2022 sequences, like ( and - (I know 
absolutely nothing about ISO 2022).
However, when I type ESC < or > or f or v, as well as others, I get a 
beep.  I must admit, I can't tell if the beep is instantaneous or delayed 
as Pine waits for another character, since I'm six timezones away from 
the Pine I'm using, and round-trip times are on the order of 15 seconds 
to minutes.

    So, what I'm wondering is if it would be possible, if these keys are 
not reserved for some other future use, to bind certain characters 
following ESC to the corresponding Emacs function as an Undocumented 
Feature and convenience to certain users.  Some of the ones I can think 
of that will be covered by existing Pine commands in 3.90 would be ^@ -> 
ESC f (I see no need to bind the uppercase letter, particularly when a 
VT52-like terminal uses those for arrow keys), the ESC < and > functions, 
and ESC v for ^Y.
    If the Pine Team is really into it, other presently unimplemented
functions could be bound too, like ESC b (back one word) or ESC d (delete
forward word) or ESC DEL/BS (delete backward word) or ESC nnn (numeric
argument, like ESC 15 ^K to delete 15 lines), to accommodate power users
who like the Pico interface but are too attached to powerful Emacs
commands.  This would make sense if there were plans to include those
functions bound to Pico command keys in a future release, but I'm not
suggesting you add such code just for an Undocumented Feature that could
be eliminated in a later Pine. 
    Of course, I could use Emacs as my alternative editor, but it seems 
like it would be a simple matter to make Pico more accommodating without 
compromising its functionality by understanding these currently unbound 
key sequences, such as ESC v as well as ^Y or ESC ESC Y.

    Anyway, just a thought, and a sign I need to try other things to get 
to sleep

I know this has been gone over before, but we are desparate for

Then in June, it was "on the way."  Any sort of clue when 3.90 (even

I'm not saying release an unfinished product.  Just would like to know
when to really expect 3.90 to be out.  My users are clamoring to get some

When I reply to a message, Pine includes my signature at the top.  How do 
I prevent this?  Just kidding. = )  My question is (slightly) more 
interesting:

My default folder collection is on a remote server.  However, I would 
like the "sent-mail" folder to be stored on the local server.  I tried 
setting,

default-fcc=~/Mail/sentmail

but this won't work.

What's a man to do?

Thanks!

Is there a way to get Pine to use uuencoding on attachments so that
people w/o access to MIME can still get at the file?

Thanks.

I have compiled PINE, IMAPD and PICO successfully and am using them under
DG/UX 5.4.2.R01 and DG/UX 5.4.3 (Motorola 88K AViiONs). The executables
are available via anonymous FTP to "zeus.agfx.com". Take a look in the
"pub/pine" subdirectory. 

Please note that PINE and its utilities are under copyright by the 
University of Washington, and that the University of Washington does not 
support the DG/UX binaries.

Good luck!

Date: 22 Jul 1994 20:56:59 GMT
Message-Id: <30pbqr$sdk@dgsi.cimage.com>

All of the other mailers that I use have the option to exit (X)
instead of quitting (Q).  The difference is that quitting saves
changes to the message file (clears New flag to Unread, deletes marked
messages, etc.), while exit abandons all changes and leaves without even
resetting the new message flags to unread.

Is these a way to do this in Pine?  It seems to always clear flags,
even if I quit with a ^C.

Thanks.

I downloaded a pc-pine, too, and get the message:

PC/TCP resident module is not loaded; aborting program...

All I want to do is read in the mail file I downloaded. Isn't there a way 
to do that? That's the kind of offline mail reading I would like to be

Find a good wyse30 termcap/terminfo pair (sorry, but Sun's ain't that hot)
and use screen to come as close as possible to emulating vt100.

Or make 'em give you a sparcstation. ;)

The problem is that Pine does not remember the previous state of the folder,
so such an option is not really feasible...

WinPine has not been released yet.  It will probably be part of the Pine 
3.90 release...

A while ago, I mentione dthat I had compiled 3.89 on DG/UX, and people 
asked me what I did etc, I have never heard back to hear if my advice was 
correct or not...Those of you who did: were my instructions

	Sure...I do when necessary.

1.	While in compose mode use ^Z to suspend pine.

2.	uuencode the the file you wish to send.

3.	Type fg to return to pine.

4.	Use ^R to read-in the uuencoded file.

It would be very handy to be able to build mailing lists from nicknames 
in the address book.  When I tried this it didn't work, and I had to 
recopy the addresses for the mailing list even though they were already 
elsewhere in the address book.

It is a lot more convenient to use mailto or mpack which produce
MIME's message/partial format so that the parts can be sorted and
reassembled automatically.  Pine3.89 can't do that yet but the new
Pine will hopefully handle them via mailcap.

Pine always runs in your home directory.  If the file is elsewhere
you can enter the filename in the Attchmnt: field with its path.

    You may wish to point your recipient to a means of decoding MIME
attachments, since that will become increasingly common; whether through
mpack/munpack, or by adding metamail to the user's present mailer, or
making use of a mailer with MIME built-in such as Pine or many others.
For information on such programs and where to find them, check out the
FAQ posted to comp.mail.mime .  I'd give the pointer to mpack at CMU
but this isn't a convenient environment from which I could find it, sorry...

Subject: Re: Pine on a Data General

Thanks for the offer but I finally got it going.  Now if I could only read
the man pages!  Have you found a good way to format man pages so you
can read them on a DG.  I was going to get groff, but I needed a c++
compiler for that.  So I was going to get a version of gcc that has a
c++ compiler but found I needed gmake.  At this point I figured I don't
have enough time to do this, considering how long it takes to figure
out how to customize these packages to run on a DG.  
Sometimes the DG can be very frustrating because it's a lot like system V
except where it's not.

Thanks,

Sue

Just to set expectations correctly (i.e. suitably *low* :)...

We hope to release with 3.90 an early version of "PC-Pine for Winsock".

  o It is *NOT* a full Windows GUI application.
  o It has the same character-oriented UI as the Unix and DOS versions,
    although, like the DOS version, you can use the mouse to select 
    or activate some things.
  o It does have a hint of Windows-ness, e.g. a resizable window, settable
    font, and some *very* limited clipboard support.
  o It does get out from under the 640K memory limit, so you can actually
    invoke an image viewer from within PC-Pine for Winsock.

To try to emphasize the difference, I've been referring to this as
"PC-Pine for Winsock" and reserving the name "WinPine" for a hypothetical,
maybe-it-will-happen-someday full GUI version.  Undoubtedly we will
look at adding some of the desired features incrementally in future 
releases, so the difference may become very blurred, nevertheless:

It's important that expectations be set correctly.  We've already had
negative feedback from a couple of people who expect(ed) a full GUI
version with a nice big SEND button, scrollable text regions, full Windows
cut/paste, etc.  As a matter of fact, the head of our Client Services
department is not sure we should even release "PCP4W" since he feels so
many people will be disappointed.  (We intend to make it available anyway,
but if you have an opinion on this issue, one way or the other, please let
me know... mail just to me, though; let's not burden the list.)

More precisely: 3.90 has an option that tells Pine to use the current 
working directory instead of home directory.  As yet there is no option 
to explicitly set the Export directory.

Hello... I've had a lot of complaints from people whom I send mail to via 
Pine (which I think is great but which the complainers don't have or 
don't use) when I ^R a *straight-text* file into a letter they can't read it.
Is there a fix for this other than waiting for 3.90? We're on 3.87 here 
and I've banged my head against a brick wall trying to get them to update 
to 3.89 even... Is it possible to run the complete Pine program from 
within an individuals home directory? If so, how difficult is it to do?

Thanks,
Steve...

    I don't think this is right -- I think you mean, when you ^J attach
a file it becomes unreadable.  Any ASCII-only file when read with ^R
should remain readable, however, if non-ASCII (8th-bit-set) characters
appear in the file, such as for non-English text, they will be converted
to quoted-printable encoding, which is not itself directly readable.

    Sure, it works with no problem.  If you have space to compile it,
and either alias the pine command to ~/pinewhatever/bin/pine, or put
that directory in your path before the system-wide pine, otherwise
you'd wind up running the system-wide version...  Usually Pine itself
will build with no problems at all.  Read the instructions that come
with it, and good luck.

I would like to Post to Usenet Newsgroups from Pine.  Whenever I do that, 
however, using the usual ways, I always get my site appended to the name; 
e.g. if I try to post to alt.foobar, the to: field becomes 
alt.foobar@rahul.net.

eh?

Anyone out there have any luck using pine with a UUCP connection.  

Basically what we are trying to do is use pine to send mail to the
internet through attmail.  Our connection to attmail is via UUCP.  Since
pine does not support the ! addressing I was hoping someone could offer
suggestions on how we should be configuring sendmail, etc.

Thanks for any response.

Get the OReilly book on sendmail, it shuouldn't be too difficult, if your 
sendmail already sends mail to the UUCP addresses without problems, then 
PINE will work equially well. (If that makes sense)

In an earlier posting I mentioned that read messages moved to folders

I have also noticed that answered messages lose the "A" flag when

Is this also something that will be taken care of in 3.90?

Is there a way to suppress saving attachments in the sent-mail folder? 
For space reasons I would like to keep the text of mail that has been sent
with attachments, including, if possible, a reference to the attached
file(s), but without the attachment(s).  

On a similar note, I would also like to be able to save the text of 
incoming mail to a folder without the attachments, but have been unable 
to figure out a simple way to do this.

Since MIME runs on our PINE program, which is   
Pine 3.88 , would it be correct to assume that anyone 
who is running Pine 3.88 or later has MIME running
on their machine?   
    Thanks for your answer.

    Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as CONTROL-SPACE.  However,
in practice, it appears that a number of keyboards generate the NUL
character (which is CTRL-@ ) with it.
    It's quite possible that a number of terminal emulators or telnet
programs won't send a NUL.  (In part, that's why I wondered about binding
the Emacs ESC sequence to this function.)  Many of the non-alphabetic
control keys just don't generate the correct character...

    There is an S register, normally set to 043 (the + character) which
determines the escape character your modem responds to (sorry, my 300 baud
acoustic coupler did not come with instruction manual).  To disable this,
one should set it to a value of 128 or above.  It appears that it has
been set to 0, which happens to be the numeric position of the NUL
character, instead of disabling the escape sequence.

    Come to think of it, I've wondered why an 8th-bit-set character would
not then put the modem into command mode...  The pleasures of living in
an ASCII-only world, I tell you...

    I've wondered the same thing, whether it might be possible at some time
to be able to manipulate mail saved into folders to delete the attachments
themselves after it's been saved to that folder.

    A hack workaround I can think of would be to reply or forward that
mail to yourself, and during composition, delete the reference to the
attachment in the header, and then manually adding a reference thereto
into the text of the outgoing message.

    You can also <E>xport the message, which has the effect of stripping
the header to its bare essentials, losing the separator line which makes
it unusable by Pine as a mail folder, and will insert comments about the
attachments, as well as the character set tagging, automatically.  This
Exported file will by default appear in your home directory, and is not
a folder that Pine expects to find, nor can Pine understand it.

Help!  Is it possible to do batch commands in Pine?  Like, tag a bunch of messages, and then copy them all to another folder?  Is that feature coming up in a 
future version?

The "Y" command in my pine does not print on my printer.
WHY? Or, how can I print my letters from the folder index,
to my printer? Or even opening up the highlighted letter,
then printing?

Pine 3.0(?) and later supports MIME.  There is no separate "MIME" program
though...

I'm not sure if Hans' problem is exactly like mine, but when I try to 
print using the 'Y' command, it prints for awhile on my printer, then 
stops and locks up my session. I hit ctrl-z to get out of it, and my 
printer becomes my monitor (all commands and their output goes to the 
printer), while my monitor stays the same. I then quit my modem program 
(Telix in this case), start it up again, and all is fine.

Any suggestions as to how to get this to work?

Hi,

I have a couple of queries which some kind soul (or souls) may be 
able to help me with...

Is there a Pine FAQ? My local news site doesn't appear to have a
copy.

(Sorry if this *is* a FAQ!) I have just downloaded the pine 3.89
distribution and I see that support for PC-Pine over PC-NFS is
expected 'real soon now'. Is there any indication how soon that
might be?

I would appreciate any replies by email if possible.

Thanks in advance,

David Gray                           davidg@itswa.dialix.oz.au

Could someone tell me how to configure pine to use certain browsers
for particular attachment types. I have managed to view gif files but
can not work out how to view/process application/postscript attachments.
I know I can save them then view them, but I would like access to the 
PostScript viewer from within pine.

If you tell me to read a FAQ then please tell me where and how to get
hold of it.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.

Date: 25 Jul 1994 13:35:19 GMT
Message-Id: <310f2n$qll@noc1.mid.net>

Hello,

My question concerns the access of mailboxes via imap.  When I input the
mailbox string for the g key I have to write it like this:

	*{imap.mid.net/anonymous}pub/NET/94-07-25

This format specifies a single mailbox.  Will it be possible in the
future to write it so that is specifies a pattern.  This would allow me
to display multiple mailboxes as oppose to letters in a single mailbox.
To take this one step further, will pine in 3.90 accept the following in
the .pinerc

	news-collections=Groups *{imap.mid.net/anonymous}[pub/NET/94*]

I just can't get this to work in any shape or form.

Paul

I have recently changed to using a tenex mailbox for better performance
reading my rather large mailbox.  I use IMAP (IMAP2bis server that came with
PINE v 3.89) in PINE (v 3.89) to read my mail. 

The problem I have noticed, since changing to a tenex mailbox, is that every
delete (just hitting "d") seems to take about 1 second (the expunge is very
fast when I get to it).  You can imagine how frustrating it is to try to
delete ~300 consecutive messages. 

Am I missing something or is this a design fault in the tenex "driver" 
code?

I just started using pine, and I've got most of my problems taken care of
by friends, but still have a few things I need help with.

1) How can I set pine to not create the ~/mail directory, but rather use
my ~/Mailbox directory, where I have the saved-messages files?

2) I have pine set up with the news-collection on our NNTP server.  How
can I get pine to list just the groups with news messages?  Also, how
to I get pine to start at the first new message, instead of at the last?

3) How does pine read kill files (i.e., How do I set pine to read a kill
file from a particular place?  for example, I have a kill file for the
news group rec.collecting.cards, so my kill file exists as ~/Mailbox/
rec/collecting/cards/KILL)

4) Is there a simple way to mark all messages as deleted (catch up in
most mail readers)?

	Thanks,

There is a Pine FAQ, but we have not published it yet...

There _is_ a PC-NFS version of PC-Pine.  Where did you find the indication
that it was not yet available?

Setting the "mail-directory" variable in your .pinerc file should take care
of that.

This mode is not available.  All subscribed newsgroups are listed.

Pine does not read kill files at this time.

I'm putting this on the newsgroup instead, to make the extra point that:-
I would assume that the Winsock version will also work in a DOS window 
under OS/2 with IBM's TCPIP (with the winsock extra feature); given that, 
and also on the "half a loaf better than no bread" I would vote 
enthusiastically for whatever is available.

    CTRL-SPACE is just one of the possible ways to enter this
    character.  Other possibilities, depending on how your emulator is
    set up, might be CTRL-@, CTRL-` [grave-accent], or even CTRL-0
    [zero].  (I'm assuming that you pressed "shift" together with
    "ctrl" when you tried CTRL-@, since @ is a shifted character).

    If this is a Hayes-command-set modem, you can change the wake-up
    character by setting S-register 2.  The usual wake-up sequence is
    "+++", corresponding to S2=43.  It looks like this modem has been
    set to S2=0.  To disable the wake-up character entirely, use
    S2=255.

I use pine almost exclusively with my internet account.  The main reason for
this is that my account is on a NeXT computer, and I don't like to use 
NeXT-mail because it cannot be used over the modem.  Thus, I also use rtin
to read News.  I hate the vi editor that rtin uses.  For the normal NeXT
news reader, it uses NeXT-mail to post.  So, I was wondering if it is 
possible to use pine to post to the news service.  Thanks in advance, and
I will be watching this newsgroup to catch any replies.

I too hope for compatibility with OS/2 and IBM's TCP/IP for OS/2, even if
it is only through a DOS window.

Actually both GOH LIU KANG's and Dean Penn's articles were
crossposted to comp.mail.elm and comp.mail.pine.  The answer
is that with Pine 3.89 you can't have customized headers but
with Elm you can.  Pine 3.90 (coming RSN) will allow customized 
headers....

Hi,

I wonder if anyone can help me. I am in the process of scheduling a
workshop for some of our post-grads to introduce them to the internet
 using a number of tools. Not wanting to re-invent the wheel (nor do I
 really have the time), .... I'm looking for sites where I can
download training/user manuals on:

 
         list-servers
         email tools (pine and eudora)
		     ^^^^^^
         ftp
         gopher
         WWW
         Mosaic
         rn and nn news readers
 
 (Manuals designed to teach the novice).
 
 Many thanks in advance

Not sure about using pine, but you can set pico as your default editor.
Check your .* files  and add the setting there. Or if you're having
trouble, you can add
 setenv EDITOR pico 
to your .cshrc or .login files.

Sounds like a flow-control problem.  The host system is dumping data 
faster than the printer can print it, so for large files the terminal 
emulator is forced to throw away data because it cannot buffer it.  You 
then lose the "Turn Printer Off" control codes, so everything the host 
system sends still gets printed on the printer.

I have no specific suggestions, other than to be sure the flow control 
parameters are set correctly.

That bounces it I think.  Forwarding (terminology blah) cmiiw is like

Hope someone can help a Pine relative newbie with a question...

A great deal of my Internet mail comes from a mail reflector. The only 
way I have to tell whether or not someone sent the message to me 
individually or it is coming from the mail reflector is to be able to see 
the internet mail headers, as opposed to the very nice cleaned up 
to/from/cc that Pine gives.  I looked thru the .pinerc file, where I 
figured out on my own how to do my sig block and get it on the bottom, 
and theere seemed to be a feature what would do this, that was part of 
the "old growth" group, which was already specficied.  I tried spefically 
mentioning it anyway, didn't help.  So, I'm stumped.  Any sugesstions 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

When doing a 'build sgi' I get the following error:

Has anyone come across this before? Can someone help me with this please?

Yes, I am interested in such a feature where if you like you can let Pine 
display non-standard headers. For ex: a friend of mine has is Std. Disclaimer
as a part of his header. While in Pine ofcourse 'am not able to see that.
Any help in this greatly apprctd. 

I know this feature will be very easily avail. in 3.9 when it comes 
out in two weeks from now. :-)

The system we are using for our Internet connection is also used as a
database sever. The problem is the Internet users are currently a
smaller population then the strictly database users. See when a users
sends mail via pine (or any MUA) to a strictly database user it gets
delivered to the user even thought that person has no access to a mail
reader.

The only solution I have come up with so far is to create a file for
everyone I don't want to recieve mail in the spool dir and make it
read/write to nobody. That should at least cause sendmail heartburn
enough to spit the mail back. Sounds a little drastic to me. 

Any better ideas?

Of course none of this addresses the rest of the problem, that pine
will (very helpfully) fill in the data gathered from /etc/passwd on the
users that I don't want to be recieving mail when you finish filling
out the To: field (Can't ever have just one problem at a time)

You could use a line-per-user in the aliases file or a .forward file per
user to pipe the mail into a script of some sort that sends back mail
explaining the situation to the sender.  The script could invoke sendmail
directly to send the mail or just use the regular Berkeley mail command to
send the mail.

    The command ``H'' will toggle display of short headers, or full
headers of mail.  If you get an error message, your .pinerc needs to
be set to enable this command before it will work.

Try changing _tzname to tzname, or just delete that reference entirely.  We
did the latter with Pine 3.90, since it seems that SGI can't make up its mind
what it is called.

One possible explanation for your delete problem may be in your system's
implementation of the fsync() call.  The tenex driver uses update mode I/O; a
delete is simple the change of a single byte of a file, followed by an fsync()
to force the update to be written to the disk.  An aggragate delete (delete of
multiple messages at the same time -- this is supported in Pine 3.90) would
update all the bytes before doing the fsync().

Some operating systems implement fsync() as sync() which can be quite bad.  If
this seems to be the problem, try disabling the fsync() calls.  This may
improve performance, at the risk of being vulnerable to lost updates in the
event of a crash.

to read mail (not write...) offline, assuming you have a dos sys, use 
"readmail". very good program, and couldn't be cheaper... it's freeware...

Offline, with my old xt i use readmail to read and I write with pico 
(that cames with the pine.zip. pine won't work as offline, but pico works 
anyway). The advantage of readmail is that works even if I download many 
folders created with pine.

Hi,
	I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a way to send mail
along with a blind cc. We have discovered that blind cc's are not very
popular among mail systems, but I have been told there is a way to do so.
I have read the man pages, docs, and all else I could find. Any help is
appreciated. Thank you in advance.

I suspect this is a can of worms post, but here it goes.  :-)  I am
wondering what the plans are for PINE and encryption.  Is PGP, PEM,
an API or none of the above the direction that PINE is going to take?
We have a new committee on electronic forms being formed right now
and I think they are leaning towards PEM.

By the way, if any of the ISA Corp people read this, what is the
direction of ECS Mail?

Thanks,

As I recall you put the cursor in the header area and press CONTROl-R 
[Rich Headers] and the "Bcc" field magically appears.  Some systems don't 
acknowlege them though, so in some cases the recipients may actually see 
the "Bcc" list.

Thanks,

Mike

How about aliasing every user to a nonexisting username (like

It's easy to fix, you have to declare _tzname in os_sgi.c. Add the following

     extern char *_tzname[2];

That should do it.

Try: brolga.cc.uq.oz.au Location: /POPmail/readmail.exe

Follow up to what I wrote yesterday... Pine and PCPine requires an active 
conection to a mail server... (being sendmail or whatever else in your 
network...) thereafter *pine is not an offline reader*.
But... with readmail I'm quite happy... of course not all the features 
that one would love... but improving all the time (I just dowl. ver. 4.1, 
a great improvement... I can now open several "folders" at the same time...)

for those who want to check it out is, for some strange reason, under the 
subdirectory of "textutil" in any of de SimTel ms-dos mirrors.

I do not now if it is allowable, but I will like to "post" the zip here 
(after all is freeware, and as far as i now is the *only* offline reader 
that we, dos users, can use when not connected with the unix...)

Yes, while reading the message press 'H'.  You must also set this 
option in your .pinerc

feature-list=enable-full-header-cmd  or

Subject: IMAP is a failure?
Date: 27 Jul 1994 19:42:45 GMT
Message-Id: <316dbl$rm@radar.li.icl.se>

In "Open Systems Today", June 20, 1994, page 72 "TCP/IP Packages"
5th column 3rd paragraph you can read:

"At one time, IMAP was a serious <unreadable word> against POP for the
remote-access E-mail protocol crown, but POP appears to have won, at
least for now."

(Sorry for <unreadable word>. Let's blame my fax's lack of resolution)

The conclusion seem to be based on the ratio between mailreaders POP
versus IMAP support among TCP/IP packages for Windows PCs.

I happens to know about at least one big software vendor being
_very_ concerned about this article and making future plans
accordingly. Not a very substancial decision may be, but the
tendency is somewhat alarming.

If many vendors put importance in these kind of speculating articles
and, even worse, take a journalist's interpretation as facts of life,
we are in trouble, folks.

I think most of the people out there don't understand the benefits of
IMAP. They seem to think one mail access protocol is enough and choose
the one they understand most/that is least complicated/have been around
longest.

I guess a _big_ obstacle for IMAP is the delayed process of making
the draft of IMAP4 to a RFC.

Is IMAP too complicated to implement?

If c-client hadn't been there for us to catch, we had definitely been
an average POP client today. We hadn't been able to do the core coding
ourself, due to limited budget. Thank's Mark, you saved us.

Are big vendors afraid to rely on free software? Too bad if they have
to invent the wheel all over again just because of some principle. Or
rather, select technology by initial cost and not by functionality.

Comments, please...

(Note that this posting is biased by my own fondness of IMAP :)

    There are two things you need to change.  First, do you see the ISO
Latin-1 characters correctly?  That is, a with umlaut, or do you see
the US-ASCII equivalent of d ?  Or do you see a different character
altogether?
    If the character is displayed as it should be, then all you need
to do is set your .pinerc so that it explicitly states your value for
the charset is ISO-8859-1 (failing to specify it means US-ASCII is
assumed).

    Not being familiar with Linux, I can't give you precise directions
on what to do to get the correct characters to display if they don't --
you need a font which makes use of the ISO 8859-1 encoding.  I'm not
sure if you see an IBM code page, where you see incorrect characters,
but in the ``extended ASCII'' range, in which case a code page like CP819
would work, or just ASCII equivalents (d, v, and | for umlauted a, o,
and u), in which case you need to get an 8-bit path to the display (and
possibly an 8859-1 font).  Once you get the correct characters to display,
you can suppress the notice you quoted above by setting the .pinerc
(or /usr/local/lib/pine.conf) charset value to ISO-8859-1.
    Perhaps another Linux user who has been able to view Latin-1
characters with Pine can outline Linux-specific steps needed.

	Hadn't you heard?  The entire "pine team" has been relocated
to Australia.  :-) :-)  

	The stock answer is "two-weeks"....I'm sure they just have
to get the last one or two known bugs out.

Hi Mark,
	All you have to do to find out about command line options should 
be something like typing pine -- at the command line. I get a whole list 
of options that way, which is where you will find how to enable ^Z. The 
switch to do so is -z. So, start pine with pine -z. Then you should be 
able to suspend it to your hearts content. Good pining. Hope this helps.

I don't think that this is the reason for the preponderance of POP
based mailers, but that many people need something that minimizes
connection times because they're not directly connected to a network.
It seems that most of the single-user PC based solutions are aimed at
users who use modem connections to get their mail, and who are charged
for the connection time.  In this case it makes much more sense to
grab it and read/respond off-line rather than tie up the line for
extended periods of time.

I read this too, and was surprised.  Especially since almost every guide 
to the internet talks about using PINE for mail.  It seems strange that 
the PC people can't develop good IMAP clients, or that OST seems to think 
that IMAP is not popular....

Hello Mark - There is a data structure that you can set up in your
.pinerc file called 'feature-list'. The feature-list is a comma
separated list of various config attributes that you can enable. Here's
a copy of my feature list that includes enabling ^Z for suspending:

feature-list=enable-unix-pipe-cmd,
	enable-suspend,
	enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
	quit-without-confirm,
	enable-jump-shortcut,
	enable-goto-cmd,
	signature-at-bottom

It's OK to put each item on a separate line provided:
A.) Each line begins with white space (a line beginning with a tab or  space
is considered a continuation of the previous line).

B.) you end each item with a comma.

You may not want your list set up like mine but take note of 
line 2 - This is the item that enables suspend.
Good-luck
Dave

Hello!

>From time to time I receive mail sent with a different charset than the

Subject: Screen vs. Pine [pico]
Date: 28 Jul 1994 15:30:09 -0400
Message-Id: <319101$2sv@ivory.lm.com>

I use the "iScreen" program to make multitasking easier on our
workstations.  Pine is my mailer of choice.  "Screen" lets you cut and
past segments of the screen from one virtual terminal into another.  This
proves problematic when pasting multiple lines into Pico, because pico
interprets the unix EOL (^J) as meaning "justify".  The only "fixes" to
this problem I could find are:  1) make sure there's NO OTHER TEXT within
twelve lines of the pasting area, or it will get sucked into pico's
justifying vortex, or 2) use the alternate editor (vi).  Both alternatives
are unsatisfactory.  Is there any way to tell pico to simply treat the
^J's as newlines?

Thanks in advance!

Sure you can. Invoke pine with the -z flag/option.
% pine -z

Then you will see for sure yourself that cntrl-z will work. Infact you can
alias pine to pine -z in you .login/cshrc files that way it will be
default.

In SGI's Irix-5.2, /usr/include/time.h already declares

	extern char *tzname[2];

If you change _tzname to tzname in rfc822_date()  (in "os_sgi.c"), then
everything will compile just fine.

Also, there is another bug in os_sgi.c that causes problems with remote
imap sessions.  Even when you have /etc/rimapd defined on the server,
pine will still prompt you for a password.

This can be fixed by finding the string (in os_sgi.c)

	"/usr/ucb/rsh"

and changing it to RSHPATH (no quotes).  RSHPATH is already defined
in the makefile and will be handled by the c-preprocessor.

: Hello Mark - There is a data structure that you can set up in your

: separated list of various config attributes that you can enable. Here's
: a copy of my feature list that includes enabling ^Z for suspending:

: feature-list=enable-unix-pipe-cmd,
: 	enable-suspend,
: 	enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
: 	quit-without-confirm,
: 	enable-jump-shortcut,
: 	enable-goto-cmd,
: 	signature-at-bottom

: It's OK to put each item on a separate line provided:
: A.) Each line begins with white space (a line beginning with a tab or  space
: is considered a continuation of the previous line).

: B.) you end each item with a comma.

Several people suggested the above.  
I've tried putting the feature-list=enable stuff in my .pinerc file,
but it seems that it doesn't work for some reason.  I still have to include
the -z parameter in the command line.  Also, I tried using your whole
feature list, but the signature-at-bottom doesn't automatically append my
signature.  So it may seem that my .pinerc file isn't even being read, but
I know certain parts, like file (folder?) defaults, are working fine.  Am
I missing something?

There is a bug in os_sgi.c that causes Pine to prompt for
a password even when IMAP is accessed with rsh.

In os_sgi.c, find the string "/usr/ucb/rsh" and change it to

    RSHPATH

Don't surround this with quotes, it's not a string
but a #defined c-preprocessor thingie.

Here are the list of changes that I made to get Pine v3.89 to
compile under Irix-5.2

os_sgi.c:

  Critical change!!!

    In rfc822_date(), change "_tzname" to "tzname".

  Not-so-Critical change...

    Locate the string "/usr/ucb/rsh" and change is to RSHPATH
    Do NOT put this in quotes!!!

Now you're ready for prime time.

: I read this too, and was surprised.  Especially since almost every guide 
: to the internet talks about using PINE for mail.  It seems strange that 
: the PC people can't develop good IMAP clients, or that OST seems to think 
: that IMAP is not popular....

I think the reason you're seeing this is a change in the point of reference.
You are correct that every guide to the internet mentions PINE or ELM for
mail.  However, there is a huge trend towards having central servers
with many clients around thme (gee, a LAN maybe?).  Anyways, POP has one
great advantage for a client/server set-up:  It goes out, does what it needs
to do, then closes up shop.  This cuts down greatly on any unnecessary network
traffic.  It's also less overhead for the client system.  Every little bit helps.  

Of course, I like IMAP better and wish it would be the reigning champ.  But
POP provides better functionality for remote PC-based clients.

Subject: Reading in a file
Message-Id: <316l8r$9jg@kaiwan.kaiwan.com>
Date: 27 Jul 94 21:57:47 GMT

Got a slight problem.  My home directory is defined like this:
/u1/home5/rhsiung

However, in my .cshrc file, I change the environment variable home so 
that my home directory is:
/u1/home5/rhsiung/home

This is so I could make my directory public.  Well, the problem I'm having
is this.  In Pine, when I save files, it saves into my current 'home'
directory.  The one that is defined with 'set'. (environment variable)
Which is fine.  However, when I'm editing a reply or new message, (with
Pico I suppose - the one that defaults when Pine is used), and I try to
READ IN a file, it always defaults to my actual home directory
/u1/home5/rhsiung.  HOWEVER, when I use Tin and it pops into Pico (the one
defined in my .cshrc file as EDITOR, it works okay and reads from the
proper directory.  Why is this?  I've looked for a config file for pico
but could not find one.  It doesn't seem to define this in the .pinerc
file either .  Can someone help me?  It would be greatly appreciated.

If your mail host is unix based, you can use a .forward to specify where
your mail should be forwarded to.

In addition, and again for Unix hosts, there is a program called
"vacation" that in addition to setting up your .forward file will set up
an auto-reply to the sender to let them know that you are off-site and
will be replying to your mail later.

See your local man pages for more info.

Often one wants to quote the email address of a third party in the text 
of a message.  This usually involves postponing compose, looking in the 
addressbook, copying down the email address when found, resuming compose, 
typing in the email address, etc.

Alternative:  Use the cc field for the nickname of the 3rd party; the 
full address will appear.  Use ^K to delete it.  Move cursor down to 
text, hit ^U to restore it.

There are two gateways that I know of.  To post an article, sent it via
E-mail to:

	groupname.usenet@decwrl.dec.com

or

	groupname@helios.physics.utoronto.ca

where you substitute "groupname" with the name of the newsgroup you
want to post to.

I'm using Pine to read my E-mail and would like to filter certain 
incoming messages to a particular folder other than IN-COMING.

The man pages don't say anything about filters but .pinerc has the following 
section.

# incoming-folders are those other than INBOX that receive new messages.
# Folder syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-hostname}folder-path
# Use only if you filter incoming email into multiple files or receive
# email on several different machines.
# Example:
# incoming-folders=Consulting       {carson.u.washington.edu}filter/to-help,
#                  Widget-Project   {carson.u.washington.edu}filter/to-widget,
#                  Old-Student-Acct {imap.berkeley.edu}inbox

Does this example mean that incoming E-mail with a subject line 
Consulting would be filtered into the folder help?


I'd appreciate any advice.

Thanks in advance.

I was recently asked about this feature and tried it out but 
unfortunately it won't work on our setup. We use nfs here and so mail 
comes into a mail server and is exported to the relevant user machine. 

Do you know of any other method that will work in such a situation?

Hi, I'm having a problem with pine.  When my messages print, each
screen prints over the others.  This means that I cannot scroll back
up to read the beginning of the message.  This only happens when it
prints messages.  

I can't find any way to make it stop doing this (I've checked the
options but nothing seems to help).  Is there a way, or
will I have to use elm forever?

Is there any way to send/view uuencoded messages with pine?  I administer 
an HP-UX machine, and my users aren't the most Unix literate yet, so 
hopefully there is a simple way.

Thanks,
Robert Buck

Message-Id: <316090$jh1@apollo.it.luc.edu>

I wondered if there is a version of Pine & Pico compiled for VMS available
via FTP anywhere.  I believe I tried a site in Israel, but that version
had to be compiled, something I can't, at present, do on my system do
to lack of software.  

Any help would be appreciated.

Hmmm...  That's a new mis-interpretation of the .pinerc comments ;)

No, Pine does not do delivery filtering.  You need an external filter 
program to accomplish that.  Someone at netcom should be able to tell you 
what is available there and how to use it...

It works if you put them in the first line of body text.

Dear Folks,

I have installed Pine 3.89 in our HP 735/99 running HPUX9.03.

I found it the warning message " Unparsable date" always bounces on the 
screen. It interrupt me and I can hardly key in any command. 

How can I correct it ? It is just killing me.

Appreciate if you can email me with a solution.

Hank,

	Please don't post any to the pine mailing list........this list
is for discussing issues concerning pine.....not for wasting disk space.

Subject: System Aliases in Pine
Date: 29 Jul 1994 04:13:00 GMT
Message-Id: <319vkc$1emb@ctsc.hkbc.hk>

Dear Folks,

I am a newcomer to use pine. Before, I use elm and find it useful and
comfortable except it use the awful editor vi.  In our original system,
we have some system aliases that can be use by every user. However, I
don't know how to make use of the original system aliases and work with
pine. 

I just know pine has a function to incorporate a system-wide address called
bugs-nick-name into the .addressbook for every users. Can I use the same
idea to include the original system aliases there.


Regards,

Subject: Missing Headers
Message-Id: <Ctq448.Bsq@eskimo.com>
Date: Fri, 29 Jul 1994 22:35:27 GMT

I recently started getting messages from one specific person that are 
missing headers.  I've gotten dozens of emails from her with no problem, 
and all of the sudden her messages are missing the from:, subject: and 
path: headers.  Usually the messages only has a date and to: line.

We both use Pine, and I haven't had problems with anyone else.  She has 
mailed herself letters and they look just fine.

Any ideas what this could be?

: with many clients around thme (gee, a LAN maybe?).  Anyways, POP has one
: great advantage for a client/server set-up:  It goes out, does what it needs
: to do, then closes up shop.  This cuts down greatly on any unnecessary network
: traffic.  It's also less overhead for the client system.  Every little bit helps.  

?? Are you saying that IMAP can't do that?

As far as I remember - IMAP could be used as a complete POP replacement - 
you could GET all messages onto your local system and then DELETE them 
off the server - Ta Da!!

IMAP of course offers so much more - how does POP handle users who use a 
different PC/Mac from day-to-day? (they'd end up with bits of their mail 
spread of several systems). Keeping all folders on the server AS AN 
OPTION gets rid of that problem. We have people who travel from site to 
site regularly, using different equipment for their mail reading, so POP 
is no good for them - IMAP would work a champ (if commercial mailers 
supported it :-} ).

Sure, as long as you have an SMTP server available.  Set the smtp-server
variable in /usr/local/lib/pine.conf and you should be OK.  As a backup, you
might create a sendmail script that returns an error message in case someone
tries to over-ride the smtp-server setting...

Hi,
I have a departmental Vax e-mail account.  It was set up such that any
e-mail addressed to that Vax account will be forwarded to another
University Unix account running Pine.  It was working flawlessly. 
However, suddenly it does not work anymore.  My friend tried to send
e-mail to my Vax account and I did NOT receive it at all in either my Vax
or my Unix account.  It did NOT bounce back to my friend's account
either.  What could it go wrong?  ANY advice would be appreciated.

I used to think this way too.  However, the trend these days is to force
users to perform their own housekeeping and thus relieve the pressure on
the central server.  Consequently, the difference between IMAP and POP
becomes irrelevant.  However, I do have some users who like to read their
mail from different platforms as you described.  IMAP would be better in
this case but what if such people only do it very occasionally?  Also,
what if existing users who get all their mail moved to their desktop
suddenly decide to use another for only a short time? This is regardless
of whether they use POP or IMAP since both can move all mail as you
mentioned.  Both also can leave mail on the server (POP relies on the mail
client to do it though).  So, the debate is not really which is better,
POP or IMAP.  The real question is how to solve the occasional mobile user
without forcing everyone's mail to stay on the central server?  If there
is no way then once must use the central server approach (with huge disks
to hold multi-media attachments, etc.).

Jack,
I actually disagree that "the trend these days" is toward POP's
fetch-and-delete model in order to keep mail off of a central server.  For
a growing number of folks, the "value-added" requirement for access from
multiple computers makes POP a showstopper.  (And of course as was 
mentioned, IMAP can do "fetch-and-delete" as well.)

But your response to Jason also implies something that I believe is a common 
misconception, namely that IMAP == Central.

There are two distinct issues here:

 1. At what level of an organization should mail data be stored?
    Possible answers include: central/organization-wide, departmental,
    workgroup, or desktop.

 2. Once you decide *where* the mail data lives, you must decide which
    protocol to use to access it.  Possible answers include: POP, IMAP,
    NFS, SMB, AFS, AFP, etc.

Within its design center, IMAP offers technical advantages over all the 
others.  In comparison to POP, I'll just mention the following:

 o Access to a mail store from multiple computers.
 o Ability to selectively fetch individual MIME body parts.
 o Ability to access multiple remote folders, not just INBOX.
 o Ability to support disconnected operation.

For us, access from multiple computers is sufficient reason to favor 
IMAP, as a large and growing part of our population wants access to the 
same inbox from their office desktop, their machine at home, their laptop 
while in a hotel, and sometimes from their lab computer.  

For people who connect via low-speed lines, the ability to see the 2KB
text part of a message and ignore the 2MB core dump or image file 
attached to it is a *big* deal.

And the support for disconnected operation built into the IMAP4 spec 
seems to be what has attracted several major computer vendors to IMAP.
(And no, I can't pre-announce any products for them.)

So I don't think that the question is how to support the occassional
mobile user.  For us, that's just about everyone.  The questions are: 
whether to provide a central value-added service that has superior
functionality, or moving the mail-server function closer to the user,
but still using IMAP to get at it from other machines.  By the way, there 
is no technical reason why you can't run IMAP and POP daemons on the same 
server, so that both constituencies can be happy.  We don't run POP 
centrally because that implies Client Services must support yet another 
family of user agents, but that's not a technical issue...

Obviously any central mail service must worry about disk usage.  On
campus-wide machines, we use quotas.  On departmental IMAP servers, we
don't bother.  Baylor and other sites expire mail on the central server
after a certain length of time.  MUA design can influence this as well.
Pine has an option to move mail you've already read from your inbox to a
folder on your own disk, for example.  So I think the tools exist to offer
a full-function (IMAP) mail service without losing your shirt on disk
costs.

Hmmm...that's real strange, since I have done that before, and it doesn't

Expiring old mail is an issue that I have been wondering about for some
time.  We have only been using mail on my server for a few months, so
large volumes of unread mail have not yet become an issue, but there are a
number of very inactive accounts here that could accumulate significant
numbers of unread messages as time goes by.  What kinds of programs are
available that would perform automated deletion of old mail from Unix mail
inboxes? 

Respond privately or on the list if you feel it would be useful.  Thanks!

Well checking your VAX account would be a start.  Is this VAX running
any special email package like PMDF?

It would seem that the forwaring information on your VAX account
seems to be lost.  Without knowing how this VAX is set up it would
be hard to give some good advice.

I have downloaded two binaries of Pine for AIX 3.2.  Both give the same  
results and lock up terminals everywhere.

We do not have a compiler, but if someone could send me a message letting  
me know that they are willing to help get me a compiled version for 3.2.4,  
I would be most appreciative.

Hi,
	In reponse to your message about mail being deleted, there is a 
program called mailclean that comes with something called mailsize that 
will do the trick for you. I am sorry to say that I do not remember where 
I got it from, but Archie should be kind enough to let you in on the 
secret. I just installed it on our system and all seems to be going well. 
Hope this helps. 

Steve

Subject: Problem receiving MIME mail from Lotus Notes

I was able to successfully send mail with attachments from PINE to a mail 
gateway for final delivery to Lotus Notes. When it arrived Lotus Notes 
correctly had attachments which I was able to detach into seperate files.

When I tried to do the same thing from Lotus Notes (send mail with 
attachments) to be received by PINE I am not able to view the 
attachments. PINE indicates that there are attachments, but when I press 
V to view the attachments it responds with a prompt to "Enter attachment 
number to view or save ( - ec) :" which doesn't appear to be properly 
handling the viewing or saving of attachments.

I sent a blank note from Lotus Notes (from a different location) to 
myself and it had more than one attachment. When I try to enter a 1 at 
the above prompt to view the first attachment it responds with a message 
"No such attachment number "1". Must be in displayed list".

It seems that perhaps we've run across a bug here. I am running PINE 3.89 
under Novell's Unixware 1.1.1. All other features in PINE appear to be 
functioning properly. It's actually quite a nice non-GUI mail reader, and 
I have been very satisfied with it so far.

I have a copy of the note which is causing the problem. If someone wants 
to take a look at it let me know, I will forward it to them.

If anyone else has any ideas or knows of any problems in this area please 
respond.

No, if you can read English you would have noticed I've said POP doesn't
stand in the way for some sites to leave the mail on the server (e.g.,
Eudora is a POP mail client that has the option to leave mail on the
server).  I'll admit they do it differently and IMAP is more sophisticated
to the extent that the folders are left on the server.  I get around this
problem with Eudora by using disk sharing with a workgroup PC or the unix
server itself.  I know this increases network traffic but our mail traffic
is the least of our problems.

Obviously your and my priorities are different.  My preference is to make
the users happy with the most suitable mail client I can find for our
environment with the method of mail transfer and storage a second priority.

I run both IMAP and POP.  One of the reasons I installed IMAP was to test
the PC version of pine.  I eventually gave up on it and used commercial
PCEduora since it was far better, supported uuencode, binhex and MIME,
handled attachments much better, etc.  Yet is uses the POP method and
haven't regretted using it ever since despite the limitations for mobile
users.

Having said that, I've always believed IMAP is the way to go and I'm happy
to see it used by all mailers.  I'll be glad if Eudora gave the option to
use IMAP.  That way I can stop using disk sharing for some users which
currently puts their folders back onto a server anyway.

I thought the reason POP was used so much more was simply because
it had been around longer; not because of any great technological
advantage.

Isn't IMAP capable of doing the same thing as POP?  Namely dl all
the mail, then read it locally?  Or is it that the implementation
of IMAP in PINE doesn't let you configure it to do that?

I think this whole argument is a bit ridiculous!  POP and IMAP server
two different needs, and are not mutually exclusive.  POP is better for
cases where connection bandwidth is limited and/or expensive while
IMAP has significant advantages when a connection is available.  It's
a case of the right tool for the job.  I imagine that the majority of PCs
aren't connected to servers capable of supporting IMAP so people
writing Windows mailers would naturally support a protocol that fit
the majority of their clients.

Wouldn't it make sense for someone to make PCPINE work as a POP
client?  This shouldn't be that difficult.  I'm not very familiar with
DOS/Windows mailers and am not impressed much with those I've used,
but I do know that the Eudora mail client that's bundled with Locus
PC-Interface plus has a program that will dial into a Unix system and
handle the mail transfers by telnet'ing into the POP server to grab
the mail.  I haven't looked at the scripts involved, but it shouldn't
be too difficult to implement.  Then PCPINE could just use the local
mailbox.  This same technique could also be used on Unix systems that
are not connected directly to an IMAP server machine or to get
mailboxes from remote systems.

Rather than argue which is the ``better'' technology, why not spend
the effort to support both and to promote IMAP capabilities on other
Mail User Agents?

Bill,
In the future Pine will support the "fetch-and-delete" (offline) model,
via IMAP, and quite probably via POP as well.  Later we hope to support
full disconnected operation via IMAP4, wherein the state of a client
message cache can be resynchronized with the server state.

Lotus Notes does not implement MIME.  Lotus Notes implements something that
claims to be MIME, but is not in conformance with the MIME specifications.

Lotus has been informed about the problems in their implementation.  There has
been a report to the effect that they care enough to fix it; but only time
will tell for sure.  Until Lotus offers a fixed version of Lotus Notes, I
recommend that people do not consider Lotus Notes to be a MIME-capable mail
composer.
